0	4800	Hello my friends, welcome to the new SJ Weekly.
4800	8960	This one's gonna kinda fly by fast because my time today is very limited.
8960	13300	In fact, my coffee from this morning has already gone cold, unfortunately.
13300	15760	So let's just skip that and get right to it.
15760	23560	On Metro, metro.co.uk, police are very close to losing the streets, top officer admits.
23560	27880	A top police officer has warned we are very close to losing the streets as government
27880	29720	funding cuts continue to bite.
29720	35360	Now I know that at least 50% of the United Kingdom's police force budget is devoted
35360	40040	to social media patrolling, but that stuff is absolutely essential, there's no way
40040	45320	we would ever pull resources and money off of that to actually patrol the streets of
45320	46320	the nation.
46320	52240	Sergeant Simon Kempton, Operation Policing Lead for the Police Federation, blamed a fall
52240	56280	in officer numbers for being behind a rise in violent crime.
56280	61080	He called on the government to focus protecting its citizens, and said the future looked bleak
61080	64960	if officials continued their gross underfunding of the police service.
64960	70560	Sergeant Kempton told Metro, I think the first and last duty of any government is to protect
70560	75960	its citizens, and if the budgets across government have to be constrained, difficult decisions
75960	77440	need to be made.
77440	83080	But keeping people safe, alive, and getting on top of criminality should absolutely be
83080	86140	the top priority of this and any other government.
86140	91360	This stark warning came just days after a top police chief claimed forces were at a
91360	95140	breaking point following severe cuts to their budgets.
95140	100460	And please keep in mind that the police that are on the streets are wasting their time
100460	102540	doing stuff like this.
102540	107540	Ken Marsh, Chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, admitted the country's largest
107540	112100	police force had run out of things to sell after it had been forced to sell off more
112100	115920	than 1 billion pounds worth of property over the past 6 years.
115920	119220	What about this time next year when the budget's even smaller?
119220	122040	Do we start to get rid of police officers?
122040	128240	Figures have shown that 606 police stations have closed since 2010, leaving some cities
128240	131280	such as Bath and St. Albans with no station at all.
131280	139120	And oddly enough, this actually flies in the face of the far left's propensity to regulate
139120	140120	everything.
140120	144680	You know, when when Sadiq Khan says we need to regulate knives, well who's going to be
144680	147640	the people to go out and actually regulate those knives?
147640	152120	Because if you don't have a police force to do it, it's not going to happen.
152120	153320	And that's not even the biggest problem.
153320	160560	The biggest problem is the absolute rise in knife attacks that comes with having one,
160560	167080	a non integrative population, and two, no police there to watch over the populace.
167080	173040	Let's switch gears over to Sweden, where in their preschools boys learn to dance and girls
173040	174720	learn to yell.
174720	178800	Something was wrong with the penguins, the incoming class of toddlers at the Seafarers
178800	182680	Preschool in a wooded suburb south of Stockholm.
182680	184880	The boys were clamorous and physical.
184880	186680	They shouted and hit.
186680	190260	The girls held up their arms and whimpered to be picked up.
190260	196400	The group of one and two year olds had, in other words, split along traditional gender
196400	197400	lines.
197400	198680	And at this school, that is not okay.
198680	203960	Well, there does seem to be something elemental in the human animal that has at least some
203960	207240	level of a gender split, especially at this age.
207240	211840	But as expected, a social justice education system would have to stamp that out.
211840	215360	Their teachers cleared the room of cars and dolls.
215360	218960	They put the boys in charge of the play kitchen.
218960	222080	They made the girls practice shouting no.
222080	228200	Then they decided to open a proper investigation, erecting video cameras in the classroom.
228200	233480	This may still be divided over whether gender differences are rooted in biology or culture,
233480	238240	but many of Sweden's government funded preschools are doing what they can to deconstruct them.
238240	239640	Okay, okay, okay.
239640	243580	One, I'm not sure if the science is completely divided anymore.
243580	248680	I think that we might have landed in like a 60 biology, 40 culture.
248680	250240	That sounds probably about right.
250240	253360	However, it doesn't matter to these people, apparently.
253360	257400	Whether it's biology or culture, it doesn't matter because Sweden's government funded
257400	260260	preschools want to deconstruct them.
260260	267160	Even if it somehow turned out to be 100% biology, it's something that, according to social justice,
267160	268160	needs deconstructing.
268160	275800	The state curriculum urges teachers and principals to embrace their roles as social engineers,
275800	280220	requiring them to counteract traditional gender roles and gender patterns.
280220	285040	It is normal in many Swedish preschools for teachers to avoid referring to their students'
285040	286040	gender.
286040	291040	Instead of boys and girls, they say friends or call children by name.
291040	295760	Play is organized to prevent children from sorting themselves by gender.
295760	303340	A gender neutral pronoun, hen, was introduced in 2012 and was swiftly absorbed into mainstream
303340	308880	Swedish culture, something that linguists say has never happened in another country.
308880	313580	It sounds like the Swedes are just naturally cucked, I guess.
313580	317540	The children at these schools do not show a strong preference for playmates of the same
317540	321820	gender, and are less likely to make assumptions based on stereotypes.
321820	326300	Yet the scientists found no difference at all in the children's tendency to notice
326300	330620	gender, suggesting that it may be under a genetic influence.
330620	332540	This actually makes complete sense to me.
332540	338660	The choice to have friends of the same gender or opposite gender is probably something that
338660	343620	is informed by the culture or subculture around you.
343620	347020	If you're a boy who would get bullied for being friends with a girl, you're probably
347020	348860	not going to be friends with a girl.
348860	350020	That makes sense.
350020	356500	However, the ability to look at a boy and look at a girl and notice that they are at
356500	362060	least somewhat different, yeah, that's not going away, nor should it.
362060	368540	I mean, this is like asking these kids to be purposefully colorblind in order to not
368540	372460	privilege one color over another, it's a ridiculous idea.
372460	378160	When we are drawing, says Melissa Estica, 31, one of the teachers, we see that the girls,
378160	383020	they draw a lot, they draw girls with lots of makeup and long eyelashes.
383020	385220	It's very clear that they are girls.
385220	387500	We ask, don't boys have eyelashes?
387500	390860	And they say, we know it is not like that in real life.
390860	398700	Well, boys do have eyelashes, but when it comes to drawings, like these are not lifelike
398700	400380	drawings, these are child's drawings.
400380	407340	They are meant to be generic signifiers of an idea, not lifelike specific people.
407340	413480	You know, when you could, for example, meet a man with long eyelashes and you could tell
413480	418200	he's a man because he has many other signs of being a man.
418200	424280	But when you're drawing a doodle, there might be one sign or three signs.
424280	429160	So if, if you're going to draw something simplistic, you're going to have to include something
429160	432940	like long eyelashes to show that it's a girl.
432940	434460	This is not sexism.
434460	435780	This is not a problem.
435780	438220	Miss Estica looked frustrated.
438220	443480	She had set a goal for herself to stop the children from identifying things as four girls
443480	445340	or four boys.
445340	449780	But lately her students were absorbing stereotypes from billboards and cartoons.
449780	453840	And sometimes it seemed like all the slow systematic work of the seafarers preschool
453840	455880	was flying away overnight.
455880	457980	Maybe this is happening not for the reasons that you think.
457980	460580	Maybe it's not because of billboards and cartoons.
460580	465080	Maybe part of it is genetic, maybe part of it is how it is and how it should be.
465080	470680	Maybe part of it is that even if it's cultural, there is not an inherent harm in identifying
470680	474440	things as four girls or four boys.
474440	481060	I understand the logic of not strictly identifying the kitchen area of the, of the preschool
481060	482460	as four girls.
482460	484020	You know, that makes sense.
484020	490520	Very clearly, boys should be taught basic cooking and, and like housekeeping knowledge.
490520	495720	You know, if, if you are, if you're ever an early to mid twenties guy living on your own,
495720	502160	either you live like a fucking loser or you learn how to take care of yourself, right?
502160	504000	In that essence, that makes sense.
504000	510360	You know, the, the idea of, of, of man's work or, or women's work is, is a bit ridiculous.
510360	517840	However, however, there are definitely things that are four girls or four boys.
517840	522340	For example, like maybe vaginas and penises.
522340	528240	You know, I, I, I make the joke of, of the, you know, the, the feminine traps and, and,
528240	531480	and the feminine penis, you know, in girl dicks.
531480	537480	But they're obvious jokes and I know that V might get riled up about it because he doesn't
537480	538480	get it.
538480	546760	But yeah, like, no, there are certain things that are intrinsic to either boys or girls.
546760	550360	And you can't simply say that everything is agender.
550360	552320	That is not how the universe works.
552320	556000	The most striking part about all of this, all of this gender neutral stuff is that the
556000	565740	people doing it, they're going to find themselves in, in maybe 20 to 30 years living in a caliphate,
565740	569580	which is very strictly gender regulated.
569580	572960	And so all of this stuff is going to go completely out the window because you're going to have
572960	578520	little girls in hijabs and you're going to have boys who are taught to beat them.
578520	579720	All right.
579720	589580	So Sweden, if you, if you want your ridiculous gendered ideas to continue into the future,
589580	596560	you need to get a handle on your immigration because the, these things are mutually exclusive.
596560	597560	They're both insane.
597560	603760	They are both the way that a liberal democracy should not be going, but they also don't work
603760	604120	together.
