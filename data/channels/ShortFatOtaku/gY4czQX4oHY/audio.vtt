00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Hello my friends, welcome to the new SJ Weekly.

00:04.800 --> 00:08.960
This one's gonna kinda fly by fast because my time today is very limited.

00:08.960 --> 00:13.300
In fact, my coffee from this morning has already gone cold, unfortunately.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.760
So let's just skip that and get right to it.

00:15.760 --> 00:23.560
On Metro, metro.co.uk, police are very close to losing the streets, top officer admits.

00:23.560 --> 00:27.880
A top police officer has warned we are very close to losing the streets as government

00:27.880 --> 00:29.720
funding cuts continue to bite.

00:29.720 --> 00:35.360
Now I know that at least 50% of the United Kingdom's police force budget is devoted

00:35.360 --> 00:40.040
to social media patrolling, but that stuff is absolutely essential, there's no way

00:40.040 --> 00:45.320
we would ever pull resources and money off of that to actually patrol the streets of

00:45.320 --> 00:46.320
the nation.

00:46.320 --> 00:52.240
Sergeant Simon Kempton, Operation Policing Lead for the Police Federation, blamed a fall

00:52.240 --> 00:56.280
in officer numbers for being behind a rise in violent crime.

00:56.280 --> 01:01.080
He called on the government to focus protecting its citizens, and said the future looked bleak

01:01.080 --> 01:04.960
if officials continued their gross underfunding of the police service.

01:04.960 --> 01:10.560
Sergeant Kempton told Metro, I think the first and last duty of any government is to protect

01:10.560 --> 01:15.960
its citizens, and if the budgets across government have to be constrained, difficult decisions

01:15.960 --> 01:17.440
need to be made.

01:17.440 --> 01:23.080
But keeping people safe, alive, and getting on top of criminality should absolutely be

01:23.080 --> 01:26.140
the top priority of this and any other government.

01:26.140 --> 01:31.360
This stark warning came just days after a top police chief claimed forces were at a

01:31.360 --> 01:35.140
breaking point following severe cuts to their budgets.

01:35.140 --> 01:40.460
And please keep in mind that the police that are on the streets are wasting their time

01:40.460 --> 01:42.540
doing stuff like this.

01:42.540 --> 01:47.540
Ken Marsh, Chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, admitted the country's largest

01:47.540 --> 01:52.100
police force had run out of things to sell after it had been forced to sell off more

01:52.100 --> 01:55.920
than 1 billion pounds worth of property over the past 6 years.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.220
What about this time next year when the budget's even smaller?

01:59.220 --> 02:02.040
Do we start to get rid of police officers?

02:02.040 --> 02:08.240
Figures have shown that 606 police stations have closed since 2010, leaving some cities

02:08.240 --> 02:11.280
such as Bath and St. Albans with no station at all.

02:11.280 --> 02:19.120
And oddly enough, this actually flies in the face of the far left's propensity to regulate

02:19.120 --> 02:20.120
everything.

02:20.120 --> 02:24.680
You know, when when Sadiq Khan says we need to regulate knives, well who's going to be

02:24.680 --> 02:27.640
the people to go out and actually regulate those knives?

02:27.640 --> 02:32.120
Because if you don't have a police force to do it, it's not going to happen.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.320
And that's not even the biggest problem.

02:33.320 --> 02:40.560
The biggest problem is the absolute rise in knife attacks that comes with having one,

02:40.560 --> 02:47.080
a non integrative population, and two, no police there to watch over the populace.

02:47.080 --> 02:53.040
Let's switch gears over to Sweden, where in their preschools boys learn to dance and girls

02:53.040 --> 02:54.720
learn to yell.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.800
Something was wrong with the penguins, the incoming class of toddlers at the Seafarers

02:58.800 --> 03:02.680
Preschool in a wooded suburb south of Stockholm.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.880
The boys were clamorous and physical.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.680
They shouted and hit.

03:06.680 --> 03:10.260
The girls held up their arms and whimpered to be picked up.

03:10.260 --> 03:16.400
The group of one and two year olds had, in other words, split along traditional gender

03:16.400 --> 03:17.400
lines.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.680
And at this school, that is not okay.

03:18.680 --> 03:23.960
Well, there does seem to be something elemental in the human animal that has at least some

03:23.960 --> 03:27.240
level of a gender split, especially at this age.

03:27.240 --> 03:31.840
But as expected, a social justice education system would have to stamp that out.

03:31.840 --> 03:35.360
Their teachers cleared the room of cars and dolls.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.960
They put the boys in charge of the play kitchen.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.080
They made the girls practice shouting no.

03:42.080 --> 03:48.200
Then they decided to open a proper investigation, erecting video cameras in the classroom.

03:48.200 --> 03:53.480
This may still be divided over whether gender differences are rooted in biology or culture,

03:53.480 --> 03:58.240
but many of Sweden's government funded preschools are doing what they can to deconstruct them.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.640
Okay, okay, okay.

03:59.640 --> 04:03.580
One, I'm not sure if the science is completely divided anymore.

04:03.580 --> 04:08.680
I think that we might have landed in like a 60 biology, 40 culture.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.240
That sounds probably about right.

04:10.240 --> 04:13.360
However, it doesn't matter to these people, apparently.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.400
Whether it's biology or culture, it doesn't matter because Sweden's government funded

04:17.400 --> 04:20.260
preschools want to deconstruct them.

04:20.260 --> 04:27.160
Even if it somehow turned out to be 100% biology, it's something that, according to social justice,

04:27.160 --> 04:28.160
needs deconstructing.

04:28.160 --> 04:35.800
The state curriculum urges teachers and principals to embrace their roles as social engineers,

04:35.800 --> 04:40.220
requiring them to counteract traditional gender roles and gender patterns.

04:40.220 --> 04:45.040
It is normal in many Swedish preschools for teachers to avoid referring to their students'

04:45.040 --> 04:46.040
gender.

04:46.040 --> 04:51.040
Instead of boys and girls, they say friends or call children by name.

04:51.040 --> 04:55.760
Play is organized to prevent children from sorting themselves by gender.

04:55.760 --> 05:03.340
A gender neutral pronoun, hen, was introduced in 2012 and was swiftly absorbed into mainstream

05:03.340 --> 05:08.880
Swedish culture, something that linguists say has never happened in another country.

05:08.880 --> 05:13.580
It sounds like the Swedes are just naturally cucked, I guess.

05:13.580 --> 05:17.540
The children at these schools do not show a strong preference for playmates of the same

05:17.540 --> 05:21.820
gender, and are less likely to make assumptions based on stereotypes.

05:21.820 --> 05:26.300
Yet the scientists found no difference at all in the children's tendency to notice

05:26.300 --> 05:30.620
gender, suggesting that it may be under a genetic influence.

05:30.620 --> 05:32.540
This actually makes complete sense to me.

05:32.540 --> 05:38.660
The choice to have friends of the same gender or opposite gender is probably something that

05:38.660 --> 05:43.620
is informed by the culture or subculture around you.

05:43.620 --> 05:47.020
If you're a boy who would get bullied for being friends with a girl, you're probably

05:47.020 --> 05:48.860
not going to be friends with a girl.

05:48.860 --> 05:50.020
That makes sense.

05:50.020 --> 05:56.500
However, the ability to look at a boy and look at a girl and notice that they are at

05:56.500 --> 06:02.060
least somewhat different, yeah, that's not going away, nor should it.

06:02.060 --> 06:08.540
I mean, this is like asking these kids to be purposefully colorblind in order to not

06:08.540 --> 06:12.460
privilege one color over another, it's a ridiculous idea.

06:12.460 --> 06:18.160
When we are drawing, says Melissa Estica, 31, one of the teachers, we see that the girls,

06:18.160 --> 06:23.020
they draw a lot, they draw girls with lots of makeup and long eyelashes.

06:23.020 --> 06:25.220
It's very clear that they are girls.

06:25.220 --> 06:27.500
We ask, don't boys have eyelashes?

06:27.500 --> 06:30.860
And they say, we know it is not like that in real life.

06:30.860 --> 06:38.700
Well, boys do have eyelashes, but when it comes to drawings, like these are not lifelike

06:38.700 --> 06:40.380
drawings, these are child's drawings.

06:40.380 --> 06:47.340
They are meant to be generic signifiers of an idea, not lifelike specific people.

06:47.340 --> 06:53.480
You know, when you could, for example, meet a man with long eyelashes and you could tell

06:53.480 --> 06:58.200
he's a man because he has many other signs of being a man.

06:58.200 --> 07:04.280
But when you're drawing a doodle, there might be one sign or three signs.

07:04.280 --> 07:09.160
So if, if you're going to draw something simplistic, you're going to have to include something

07:09.160 --> 07:12.940
like long eyelashes to show that it's a girl.

07:12.940 --> 07:14.460
This is not sexism.

07:14.460 --> 07:15.780
This is not a problem.

07:15.780 --> 07:18.220
Miss Estica looked frustrated.

07:18.220 --> 07:23.480
She had set a goal for herself to stop the children from identifying things as four girls

07:23.480 --> 07:25.340
or four boys.

07:25.340 --> 07:29.780
But lately her students were absorbing stereotypes from billboards and cartoons.

07:29.780 --> 07:33.840
And sometimes it seemed like all the slow systematic work of the seafarers preschool

07:33.840 --> 07:35.880
was flying away overnight.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.980
Maybe this is happening not for the reasons that you think.

07:37.980 --> 07:40.580
Maybe it's not because of billboards and cartoons.

07:40.580 --> 07:45.080
Maybe part of it is genetic, maybe part of it is how it is and how it should be.

07:45.080 --> 07:50.680
Maybe part of it is that even if it's cultural, there is not an inherent harm in identifying

07:50.680 --> 07:54.440
things as four girls or four boys.

07:54.440 --> 08:01.060
I understand the logic of not strictly identifying the kitchen area of the, of the preschool

08:01.060 --> 08:02.460
as four girls.

08:02.460 --> 08:04.020
You know, that makes sense.

08:04.020 --> 08:10.520
Very clearly, boys should be taught basic cooking and, and like housekeeping knowledge.

08:10.520 --> 08:15.720
You know, if, if you are, if you're ever an early to mid twenties guy living on your own,

08:15.720 --> 08:22.160
either you live like a fucking loser or you learn how to take care of yourself, right?

08:22.160 --> 08:24.000
In that essence, that makes sense.

08:24.000 --> 08:30.360
You know, the, the idea of, of, of man's work or, or women's work is, is a bit ridiculous.

08:30.360 --> 08:37.840
However, however, there are definitely things that are four girls or four boys.

08:37.840 --> 08:42.340
For example, like maybe vaginas and penises.

08:42.340 --> 08:48.240
You know, I, I, I make the joke of, of the, you know, the, the feminine traps and, and,

08:48.240 --> 08:51.480
and the feminine penis, you know, in girl dicks.

08:51.480 --> 08:57.480
But they're obvious jokes and I know that V might get riled up about it because he doesn't

08:57.480 --> 08:58.480
get it.

08:58.480 --> 09:06.760
But yeah, like, no, there are certain things that are intrinsic to either boys or girls.

09:06.760 --> 09:10.360
And you can't simply say that everything is agender.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.320
That is not how the universe works.

09:12.320 --> 09:16.000
The most striking part about all of this, all of this gender neutral stuff is that the

09:16.000 --> 09:25.740
people doing it, they're going to find themselves in, in maybe 20 to 30 years living in a caliphate,

09:25.740 --> 09:29.580
which is very strictly gender regulated.

09:29.580 --> 09:32.960
And so all of this stuff is going to go completely out the window because you're going to have

09:32.960 --> 09:38.520
little girls in hijabs and you're going to have boys who are taught to beat them.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.720
All right.

09:39.720 --> 09:49.580
So Sweden, if you, if you want your ridiculous gendered ideas to continue into the future,

09:49.580 --> 09:56.560
you need to get a handle on your immigration because the, these things are mutually exclusive.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.560
They're both insane.

09:57.560 --> 10:03.760
They are both the way that a liberal democracy should not be going, but they also don't work

10:03.760 --> 10:04.120
together.
