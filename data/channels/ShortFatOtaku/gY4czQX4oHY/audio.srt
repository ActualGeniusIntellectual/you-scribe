00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Hello my friends, welcome to the new SJ Weekly.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,960
This one's gonna kinda fly by fast because my time today is very limited.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,300
In fact, my coffee from this morning has already gone cold, unfortunately.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,760
So let's just skip that and get right to it.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:23,560
On Metro, metro.co.uk, police are very close to losing the streets, top officer admits.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,880
A top police officer has warned we are very close to losing the streets as government

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,720
funding cuts continue to bite.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,360
Now I know that at least 50% of the United Kingdom's police force budget is devoted

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,040
to social media patrolling, but that stuff is absolutely essential, there's no way

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,320
we would ever pull resources and money off of that to actually patrol the streets of

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
the nation.

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,240
Sergeant Simon Kempton, Operation Policing Lead for the Police Federation, blamed a fall

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,280
in officer numbers for being behind a rise in violent crime.

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,080
He called on the government to focus protecting its citizens, and said the future looked bleak

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,960
if officials continued their gross underfunding of the police service.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,560
Sergeant Kempton told Metro, I think the first and last duty of any government is to protect

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,960
its citizens, and if the budgets across government have to be constrained, difficult decisions

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,440
need to be made.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,080
But keeping people safe, alive, and getting on top of criminality should absolutely be

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,140
the top priority of this and any other government.

21
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:31,360
This stark warning came just days after a top police chief claimed forces were at a

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,140
breaking point following severe cuts to their budgets.

23
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,460
And please keep in mind that the police that are on the streets are wasting their time

24
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,540
doing stuff like this.

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,540
Ken Marsh, Chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, admitted the country's largest

26
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,100
police force had run out of things to sell after it had been forced to sell off more

27
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,920
than 1 billion pounds worth of property over the past 6 years.

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,220
What about this time next year when the budget's even smaller?

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,040
Do we start to get rid of police officers?

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,240
Figures have shown that 606 police stations have closed since 2010, leaving some cities

31
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,280
such as Bath and St. Albans with no station at all.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,120
And oddly enough, this actually flies in the face of the far left's propensity to regulate

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
everything.

34
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,680
You know, when when Sadiq Khan says we need to regulate knives, well who's going to be

35
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,640
the people to go out and actually regulate those knives?

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,120
Because if you don't have a police force to do it, it's not going to happen.

37
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,320
And that's not even the biggest problem.

38
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:40,560
The biggest problem is the absolute rise in knife attacks that comes with having one,

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,080
a non integrative population, and two, no police there to watch over the populace.

40
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,040
Let's switch gears over to Sweden, where in their preschools boys learn to dance and girls

41
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,720
learn to yell.

42
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,800
Something was wrong with the penguins, the incoming class of toddlers at the Seafarers

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,680
Preschool in a wooded suburb south of Stockholm.

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,880
The boys were clamorous and physical.

45
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,680
They shouted and hit.

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,260
The girls held up their arms and whimpered to be picked up.

47
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,400
The group of one and two year olds had, in other words, split along traditional gender

48
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
lines.

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,680
And at this school, that is not okay.

50
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,960
Well, there does seem to be something elemental in the human animal that has at least some

51
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,240
level of a gender split, especially at this age.

52
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,840
But as expected, a social justice education system would have to stamp that out.

53
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,360
Their teachers cleared the room of cars and dolls.

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,960
They put the boys in charge of the play kitchen.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,080
They made the girls practice shouting no.

56
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,200
Then they decided to open a proper investigation, erecting video cameras in the classroom.

57
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,480
This may still be divided over whether gender differences are rooted in biology or culture,

58
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,240
but many of Sweden's government funded preschools are doing what they can to deconstruct them.

59
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,640
Okay, okay, okay.

60
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,580
One, I'm not sure if the science is completely divided anymore.

61
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,680
I think that we might have landed in like a 60 biology, 40 culture.

62
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,240
That sounds probably about right.

63
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,360
However, it doesn't matter to these people, apparently.

64
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,400
Whether it's biology or culture, it doesn't matter because Sweden's government funded

65
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,260
preschools want to deconstruct them.

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:27,160
Even if it somehow turned out to be 100% biology, it's something that, according to social justice,

67
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
needs deconstructing.

68
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:35,800
The state curriculum urges teachers and principals to embrace their roles as social engineers,

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,220
requiring them to counteract traditional gender roles and gender patterns.

70
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,040
It is normal in many Swedish preschools for teachers to avoid referring to their students'

71
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
gender.

72
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Instead of boys and girls, they say friends or call children by name.

73
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,760
Play is organized to prevent children from sorting themselves by gender.

74
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:03,340
A gender neutral pronoun, hen, was introduced in 2012 and was swiftly absorbed into mainstream

75
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,880
Swedish culture, something that linguists say has never happened in another country.

76
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,580
It sounds like the Swedes are just naturally cucked, I guess.

77
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,540
The children at these schools do not show a strong preference for playmates of the same

78
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,820
gender, and are less likely to make assumptions based on stereotypes.

79
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,300
Yet the scientists found no difference at all in the children's tendency to notice

80
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,620
gender, suggesting that it may be under a genetic influence.

81
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,540
This actually makes complete sense to me.

82
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:38,660
The choice to have friends of the same gender or opposite gender is probably something that

83
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,620
is informed by the culture or subculture around you.

84
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,020
If you're a boy who would get bullied for being friends with a girl, you're probably

85
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,860
not going to be friends with a girl.

86
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,020
That makes sense.

87
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:56,500
However, the ability to look at a boy and look at a girl and notice that they are at

88
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,060
least somewhat different, yeah, that's not going away, nor should it.

89
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:08,540
I mean, this is like asking these kids to be purposefully colorblind in order to not

90
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,460
privilege one color over another, it's a ridiculous idea.

91
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:18,160
When we are drawing, says Melissa Estica, 31, one of the teachers, we see that the girls,

92
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,020
they draw a lot, they draw girls with lots of makeup and long eyelashes.

93
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,220
It's very clear that they are girls.

94
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,500
We ask, don't boys have eyelashes?

95
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,860
And they say, we know it is not like that in real life.

96
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:38,700
Well, boys do have eyelashes, but when it comes to drawings, like these are not lifelike

97
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,380
drawings, these are child's drawings.

98
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:47,340
They are meant to be generic signifiers of an idea, not lifelike specific people.

99
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,480
You know, when you could, for example, meet a man with long eyelashes and you could tell

100
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,200
he's a man because he has many other signs of being a man.

101
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,280
But when you're drawing a doodle, there might be one sign or three signs.

102
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,160
So if, if you're going to draw something simplistic, you're going to have to include something

103
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,940
like long eyelashes to show that it's a girl.

104
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,460
This is not sexism.

105
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,780
This is not a problem.

106
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,220
Miss Estica looked frustrated.

107
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,480
She had set a goal for herself to stop the children from identifying things as four girls

108
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,340
or four boys.

109
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,780
But lately her students were absorbing stereotypes from billboards and cartoons.

110
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,840
And sometimes it seemed like all the slow systematic work of the seafarers preschool

111
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,880
was flying away overnight.

112
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,980
Maybe this is happening not for the reasons that you think.

113
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,580
Maybe it's not because of billboards and cartoons.

114
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,080
Maybe part of it is genetic, maybe part of it is how it is and how it should be.

115
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,680
Maybe part of it is that even if it's cultural, there is not an inherent harm in identifying

116
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,440
things as four girls or four boys.

117
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:01,060
I understand the logic of not strictly identifying the kitchen area of the, of the preschool

118
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,460
as four girls.

119
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,020
You know, that makes sense.

120
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,520
Very clearly, boys should be taught basic cooking and, and like housekeeping knowledge.

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,720
You know, if, if you are, if you're ever an early to mid twenties guy living on your own,

122
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,160
either you live like a fucking loser or you learn how to take care of yourself, right?

123
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,000
In that essence, that makes sense.

124
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,360
You know, the, the idea of, of, of man's work or, or women's work is, is a bit ridiculous.

125
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:37,840
However, however, there are definitely things that are four girls or four boys.

126
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,340
For example, like maybe vaginas and penises.

127
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:48,240
You know, I, I, I make the joke of, of the, you know, the, the feminine traps and, and,

128
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,480
and the feminine penis, you know, in girl dicks.

129
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,480
But they're obvious jokes and I know that V might get riled up about it because he doesn't

130
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
get it.

131
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:06,760
But yeah, like, no, there are certain things that are intrinsic to either boys or girls.

132
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,360
And you can't simply say that everything is agender.

133
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,320
That is not how the universe works.

134
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
The most striking part about all of this, all of this gender neutral stuff is that the

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:25,740
people doing it, they're going to find themselves in, in maybe 20 to 30 years living in a caliphate,

136
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,580
which is very strictly gender regulated.

137
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,960
And so all of this stuff is going to go completely out the window because you're going to have

138
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,520
little girls in hijabs and you're going to have boys who are taught to beat them.

139
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,720
All right.

140
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:49,580
So Sweden, if you, if you want your ridiculous gendered ideas to continue into the future,

141
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:56,560
you need to get a handle on your immigration because the, these things are mutually exclusive.

142
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
They're both insane.

143
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,760
They are both the way that a liberal democracy should not be going, but they also don't work

144
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,120
together.
