00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
Hey buddies! This is not going to be a full anti-social media video,

00:03.840 --> 00:07.040
although I'll probably still put it in the anti-social media playlist.

00:07.040 --> 00:12.720
But today we're talking about Parler! And yes, I am over on Parler, under short fat otaku as

00:12.720 --> 00:18.720
always. I haven't really customized it, I should probably do that. And Parler is basically a

00:18.720 --> 00:23.280
Twitter replacement. They have a few other features, for example the comments underneath

00:23.280 --> 00:27.360
individual posts kind of branch out as more and more people talk about them. It's a little bit

00:27.360 --> 00:33.280
easier to follow. You can post more than, what is it, 240 characters? Twitter's character limit?

00:33.280 --> 00:36.960
You can post more than that. And probably most importantly of all,

00:36.960 --> 00:42.080
Parler is marketed as a free speech alternative. Now where have we heard that before?

00:42.080 --> 00:45.920
But a couple of weeks ago, Parler started really blowing up, and I'm talking like

00:45.920 --> 00:50.640
half a million new accounts in just a couple of days blowing up, because of the hashtag

00:50.640 --> 00:54.560
TWEGSIT. And if you go to twegsit.com, you're greeted with this page.

00:55.280 --> 01:01.520
Dear Jack, you've abused us for the last time. Censorship stinks. I'm out and I'm taking my

01:01.520 --> 01:07.600
friends with me. Reject censorship and exit Twitter. Read the open letter to Jack Dorsey,

01:07.600 --> 01:12.400
Twitter CEO. Join the TWEGSIT movement. And then it gives you a few links here you can click on.

01:12.400 --> 01:17.200
These will basically fast track your Parler account creation. And here's that open letter.

01:17.280 --> 01:21.760
Dear Jack, I want to thank you, not only on behalf of Parler, but also on behalf of the

01:21.760 --> 01:26.560
hundreds of millions of Americans to whom you have now, at last, made abundantly clear that

01:26.560 --> 01:32.240
Twitter is not their form. It's your form, where your left-wing views predominate, and theirs are

01:32.240 --> 01:37.440
only allowed if they properly align with your own radical political bias. By using the notoriously

01:37.440 --> 01:43.280
left-wing CNN and Washington Post to fact-check the President of the United States, you removed

01:43.280 --> 01:47.840
any remaining doubt as to where you stand, and the utter disdain you hold for those who dare to

01:47.840 --> 01:54.400
disagree. Frankly, you inadvertently conceded this on CNN nearly 18 months ago, where you proudly

01:54.400 --> 01:59.200
boasted that Twitter is left-leaning. You then absurdly tried to cover your tracks when you

01:59.200 --> 02:04.800
hastily added, but we do not look at content with regards to political viewpoint or ideology,

02:04.800 --> 02:10.320
we look at behaviour. Yes, behaviour like daring to depart from the liberal Twitter orthodoxy,

02:10.320 --> 02:14.960
but of course your top aid is responsible for election security and misinformation,

02:14.960 --> 02:20.560
UL Roth had already let the cat out of the bag when he proclaimed in January 2017 that there

02:20.560 --> 02:26.080
are actual Nazis in the Trump White House. By the way, did you get CNN and the Washington Post to

02:26.080 --> 02:31.360
fact-check that claim? So now, with your latest assault of President Trump, and more importantly,

02:31.360 --> 02:36.560
freedom of speech, you have, as I said, removed any remaining doubt as to your rigid left-wing

02:36.560 --> 02:40.240
ideology, your bitter contempt for those who aren't buying what you're selling,

02:40.240 --> 02:45.520
and your full-blown, full-bore intention to rid Twitter of even the most remote semblance of free

02:45.520 --> 02:50.720
speech once and for all. So thank you, Jack. Thank you for slamming shut the portals of Twitter,

02:50.720 --> 02:55.200
as we throw open the door to Parler. Your stock is plunging, your followership is tanking,

02:55.200 --> 02:59.840
and Parler is skyrocketing. So stop by and say hello on your way down, and on our way up.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.760
At Parler, we still wholeheartedly believe in freedom of speech.

03:04.480 --> 03:09.520
Sincerely, John Matze, CEO and member of Parler.

03:09.520 --> 03:13.440
P.S. At Parler, we also respect our members' privacy, their personal data,

03:13.440 --> 03:15.760
and their content as it's not sold to the highest bidder.

03:15.760 --> 03:22.320
The twigzit is here. Okay, so that is basically how Parler is spinning this. They're talking about

03:22.880 --> 03:28.000
the increasing left-wing bias on Twitter, and yes, there is an increasing left-wing bias on Twitter,

03:28.000 --> 03:32.800
no one can honestly deny that, and how that is infringing now on freedom of speech.

03:32.800 --> 03:37.120
Of course, the reply to this is fundamentally an ANCAP one, which is why it's really funny to

03:37.120 --> 03:40.800
hear it come out of lefties' mouths. Twitter is their own company, they can do whatever they want.

03:41.600 --> 03:47.200
The left has no problem with forcing companies to do things that they find to be morally acceptable,

03:47.200 --> 03:50.720
but in this one case, no, they're interfering with capitalism. You guys don't give a shit

03:50.720 --> 03:54.160
about capitalism, it's all just empty rhetoric from them. But nonetheless, let's talk about

03:54.160 --> 03:58.640
what Twitter actually did. Here's Donald Trump's Twitter feed, scrolled all the way back to June

03:58.640 --> 04:02.320
23rd, and I gotta admit, that was a lot of scrolling to do. And check out this tweet!

04:02.880 --> 04:07.840
This tweet violated the Twitter rules about abusive behavior. However, Twitter has determined

04:07.840 --> 04:12.640
that it may be in the public's interest for the tweet to remain accessible. It has no replies,

04:12.640 --> 04:17.200
no retweets, no favorites. It cannot be interacted with in any way, it can only be viewed.

04:17.200 --> 04:22.720
Now before I even open this tweet up, the way that Twitter is framing this is completely false.

04:22.720 --> 04:27.760
Twitter has not determined that it may be in the public's interest. Twitter is being told to do

04:27.760 --> 04:32.480
this by the Supreme Court. All official correspondence by the president is to be

04:32.480 --> 04:36.640
kept as public record. This has been affirmed by the Supreme Court multiple times. It's one of the

04:36.640 --> 04:41.120
reasons why Donald Trump can't block anybody on Twitter either. So no, if you actually tried to

04:41.120 --> 04:44.080
delete this tweet, I'm sure you'd have a lawsuit on your hands, that's why you're doing it.

04:44.080 --> 04:47.920
If somebody else tweeted this, they'd probably get banned. Actually no, so many people are tweeting

04:47.920 --> 04:51.520
what the contents of this tweet are now. It's kind of become its own meme, and they're not getting

04:51.520 --> 04:55.360
banned because there's too many of them. Let's view it anyway. There will never be an autonomous

04:55.360 --> 05:00.000
zone in Washington DC as long as I'm your president. If they try, they will be met with

05:00.000 --> 05:06.400
serious force. Is that abusive behavior? Is it abusive to say that you're going to defend against

05:06.400 --> 05:12.560
anarcho-communists who try to establish autonomous zones in American cities? That you're going to

05:12.560 --> 05:17.680
prevent the erection of such zones in order to actually maintain law and order within them?

05:17.680 --> 05:21.520
In order to guarantee the human rights of those people who would live in that zone?

05:21.520 --> 05:27.840
Let me get this straight, Twitter. Securing people's natural rights under the law is abusive

05:27.840 --> 05:34.640
to you. It is not necessarily the fact that Twitter has been putting this little interstitial

05:34.640 --> 05:38.880
here over top of Trump's tweets, though that is part of it. What really kicked off the whole

05:38.880 --> 05:45.600
parlor thing was putting it on this tweet specifically, on how blatantly partisan this was.

05:45.600 --> 05:51.280
Being anti-communist revolution and declaring your intent to defend yourself and defend those around

05:52.080 --> 05:57.040
you. Twitter considers that to be abusive. If that is not partisan hackery, I don't know what is.

05:57.040 --> 06:02.640
And because Twitter has gone off the deep end regarding banning anyone who is not hard left,

06:02.640 --> 06:07.280
yeah, there's going to be a lot of conservatives showing up on these non-Twitter sites, not just

06:07.280 --> 06:13.120
Parlor, but also Minds and Gab. And funnily enough, on Laura Loomer's site, there's a list

06:13.120 --> 06:18.800
of conservative accounts to follow on Parlor. And this list really is a who's who of the deplatformed

06:18.880 --> 06:25.040
right now. You have Milo, Gavin McInnis, The Proud Boys, Laura Loomer herself, Info Wars,

06:25.040 --> 06:31.840
Alex Jones, Faith Goldie, Nick Fuentes, Zero Hedge, Sargon, Sargon's on there, Tommy Robinson,

06:31.840 --> 06:38.160
Adam Baldwin, Rand Paul, Mike Cernovich, James O'Keefe, Project Veritas, Daily Caller.

06:38.160 --> 06:43.600
You know, a lot of people that I do disagree with regularly. However, I would not want to see them

06:43.600 --> 06:48.960
deplatformed. Oh God, QAnon is on there. Okay. But the point is, I wouldn't want to see these

06:48.960 --> 06:53.760
people deplatformed, even though I disagree with almost everything with someone like Nick Fuentes

06:53.760 --> 06:57.440
or whatever. I don't want to see them kicked off a site. Not because they haven't done anything

06:57.440 --> 07:02.480
wrong, man. It's still free speech, but Twitter does not care about free speech anymore. Let's

07:02.480 --> 07:06.480
not kid ourselves, guys. Parlor isn't perfect. There are some serious problems with it.

07:06.480 --> 07:12.800
Here's an oft cited thread by Mark Doppelganger. The Mbased and Red Pilled Parlor app requires

07:12.800 --> 07:18.560
providing phone number to message people over the internet. Privacy, safety, freedom of speech,

07:18.560 --> 07:23.840
phone number. Miss me with this glowing stuff. Now, that's actually pretty bad, but it doesn't

07:23.840 --> 07:28.720
make it any worse than other websites. Have you noticed that Twitter requires a phone number now?

07:28.720 --> 07:34.080
Have you noticed that Facebook does? In fact, Facebook requires a picture of your photo ID

07:34.080 --> 07:38.800
sometimes. If your name is like a non-standard name, or if you put in a nickname or something,

07:38.800 --> 07:43.280
it will require you to post a picture of photo ID to make sure you're a real person.

07:43.280 --> 07:47.520
I know I'm an old man. In fact, I just did a video on being an old man,

07:47.520 --> 07:54.000
but man, do I recall and on some level miss the times when people were saying,

07:54.000 --> 07:57.600
don't post your real information on the internet. Then someone can find you. Some creep will look

07:57.600 --> 08:01.840
you up. Don't post your phone number. Don't post your address. Don't post your real name.

08:01.840 --> 08:06.000
I would love to go back to those times. I would love to go back to the times of anonymous accounts

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
on IRC or something. This is not good for Parler, but it's still on par with everything else. I'd

08:12.000 --> 08:18.400
say it's even on Parler. And here's Parler's terms of service. Parler may remove any content

08:18.400 --> 08:23.840
and terminate access to services at any time for any reason or no reason. Although Parler

08:23.840 --> 08:29.200
endeavors to allow all free speech that is lawful and does not infringe the legal rights of others.

08:29.760 --> 08:35.360
Any invitation made by Parler to you to use the services or submit content to the services,

08:35.360 --> 08:40.160
or the fact that Parler may receive a benefit from your use of the services or provision of

08:40.160 --> 08:46.080
content to the services will not obligate Parler to maintain any content or maintain your access

08:46.080 --> 08:51.200
to the services. Parler will have no liability to you for removing any content for terminating your

08:51.200 --> 08:56.160
access to the services or for modifying or terminating the services at any time and in any

08:56.160 --> 09:01.440
way and for any reason or no reason. Although the Parler guidelines provide guidance to you regarding

09:01.440 --> 09:06.000
content that is not appropriate, Parler is free to remove content and terminate your access to the

09:06.000 --> 09:11.200
services even where the guidelines have been followed. Now this actually sounds quite bad,

09:11.200 --> 09:15.120
and on some level it is quite bad, but there's a few spots where I kind of get it.

09:16.080 --> 09:20.320
For example, when you read the part where it says Parler is not obligated to maintain your

09:20.320 --> 09:25.120
access to the services, that makes sense. Because if you lose your internet package or something,

09:25.120 --> 09:29.520
Parler is not responsible for getting you back on Parler. This basically reads like

09:29.520 --> 09:35.360
you are using Parler's property at their whim. And that does sound really bad, but as long as

09:35.360 --> 09:41.120
their whim is free speech, then you basically just have to trust them. Like it's kind of bad,

09:41.120 --> 09:46.000
but there's no other way they'd word this without putting themselves in some kind of legal loophole

09:46.000 --> 09:50.880
where if they wanted to like close down the site one day they wouldn't be able to do so, you know?

09:50.880 --> 09:55.440
I think that I think this is like standard legalese. That sucks, don't get me wrong,

09:55.440 --> 10:00.080
it's not good, but it's also par for the course, and no I won't make the pun again.

10:00.080 --> 10:03.840
The terms of this user agreement may be modified by Parler in any way and at any time without

10:03.840 --> 10:07.840
notice to you, and you agree to be responsible for making yourself aware of any modification

10:07.840 --> 10:11.760
of the terms and to be bound by any modification of the terms when you continue to access or use

10:11.760 --> 10:16.320
the services after any such modification. This is, again, a spot where Twitter had them beat,

10:16.320 --> 10:21.360
because when Twitter started updating its hate speech policy, it refused to alter really old

10:21.360 --> 10:26.480
tweets, like stuff from 2012 or whatever, I think it was 2017 or 2015 or something along those

10:26.480 --> 10:31.520
lines, when the new policy came into effect, all the tweets from before that era would not be

10:31.520 --> 10:36.080
affected. Unlike on YouTube, where 10 year old videos are getting struck down constantly for

10:36.080 --> 10:40.320
violating the terms of service or the community guidelines or whatever the fuck it is, videos

10:40.320 --> 10:45.600
that are in no way relevant and were completely in line with the terms back then. If you permit us to

10:45.600 --> 10:50.240
access the address book on your device or give us permission to import your contacts from an email

10:50.240 --> 10:55.120
account associated with your account, we may access and store names and contact information

10:55.120 --> 10:59.200
from your address book to facilitate invitations and social interactions that you initiate through

10:59.200 --> 11:03.920
our services and for other purposes described in this privacy policy or at the time of consent of

11:03.920 --> 11:09.120
collection. I mean this one seems easy, don't give them access to that shit. Unless, for some dumb

11:09.120 --> 11:14.080
fuck reason, Parler requires access to your contacts list just to use it, that would be

11:14.080 --> 11:18.720
ridiculous, but I'm on Parler, I haven't been asked anything like that. You can delete your

11:18.720 --> 11:25.520
account by emailing us your request at account.deletion at parler.com. You can't just delete it

11:25.520 --> 11:31.120
in the account settings, you have to email them. I mean that's kind of lame, but fine. You agree to

11:31.120 --> 11:35.440
receive communications from Parler, including communication sent by phone, email, text message,

11:35.440 --> 11:39.760
other means of communication. If you provided a phone number to Parler, you are required to notify

11:39.760 --> 11:43.040
Parler when you cease to own or control that number to help prevent Parler from sending

11:43.040 --> 11:47.520
communications to others who may acquire that number. Alright, so you are forced to accept their

11:47.520 --> 11:53.360
spam. That sucks, but it's just kind of annoying, you know. You agree to arbitrate any dispute that

11:53.360 --> 11:58.960
you have with Parler. You agree to resolve all disputes with Parler through binding arbitration

11:58.960 --> 12:03.920
with the American Arbitration Association in Clark County, Nevada, unless the dispute meets

12:03.920 --> 12:08.960
the requirements for small claims court and is filed in Justice Court Henderson, Clark County,

12:08.960 --> 12:15.440
Nevada. If for any reason this agreement to arbitrate is determined by a court or arbitrator

12:15.440 --> 12:20.160
to be unenforceable, you agree that the federal and state courts with jurisdiction over Clark

12:20.160 --> 12:26.240
County, Nevada will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute involving you and Parler.

12:26.240 --> 12:32.080
Any arbitration will be governed by the AAA commercial arbitration rules, consumer due process

12:32.080 --> 12:36.560
protocol, and supplementary procedures for resolution of consumer-related disputes.

12:36.560 --> 12:41.600
The arbitration will be conducted only by telephone, online, or based solely on written

12:41.600 --> 12:46.160
submissions and not by personal appearance of any party or witness. This user agreement

12:46.160 --> 12:50.880
and any dispute between you and Parler will be governed by the laws of the state of Nevada,

12:50.880 --> 12:56.880
excluding any applicable choice of law provision. Up until this point, things have seemed lame but

12:56.880 --> 13:02.240
normal for a social media site like Parler. I don't know if Twitter or Facebook or anybody else has

13:02.240 --> 13:08.800
a clause like this, but this is absolutely ridiculous. This means simply by using Parler,

13:08.800 --> 13:14.480
if you ever have reason to sue Parler, any reason at all, you can't. You have to arbitrate with

13:14.480 --> 13:19.440
them. You cannot join a class action lawsuit. You cannot file a claim against them. You can only

13:19.440 --> 13:25.360
arbitrate. Now, I've seen similar clauses like this in the past, and they almost always get

13:25.360 --> 13:31.840
thrown out as unenforceable. And I'm pretty sure that this clause here, where if it turns out this

13:31.840 --> 13:36.080
whole thing is unenforceable, you have to agree to their jurisdiction. I don't know if that's

13:36.080 --> 13:42.640
enforceable either. Who knows? But the point is, this is basically them trying to do as much of a

13:42.640 --> 13:46.720
power grab as they can, saying that, oh, if you use our service, you can't sue us. Even if we

13:46.720 --> 13:50.880
fuck you, you can't sue us. And even though this type of thing hasn't rendered unenforceable,

13:50.880 --> 13:54.000
it is going to scare a lot of people away. People who might actually have a legitimate

13:54.000 --> 13:56.800
grievance against Parler, maybe because they just don't know any better, or they don't want

13:56.800 --> 14:01.600
to go through the extra step of trying to overcome this before even filing their case, you know?

14:01.600 --> 14:06.160
Do not purposefully share rumors about other users and people you know are false. Well,

14:06.160 --> 14:10.240
that might be kind of hard. What if you actually think that it's true, and then it turns out you

14:10.240 --> 14:14.960
were wrong? What if you change your mind? What if Parler thinks you're lying? Avoid targeting

14:14.960 --> 14:19.760
red or no-badged users with disparaging information. They are more protected under

14:19.760 --> 14:25.040
the law than prominent individuals. More protected under the law? Is it because users with certain

14:25.040 --> 14:29.600
badges are like public figures or something? I mean, the whole point of social media, one of

14:29.600 --> 14:35.360
the big boons and big drawbacks of social media, is that the minute that you post on social media,

14:35.360 --> 14:39.120
you also become a public figure. It doesn't matter if you have five followers, you're still posting

14:39.120 --> 14:44.320
something publicly. Pornography is considered indecent according to clauses defined by the FCC.

14:44.320 --> 14:49.600
Do not use language or visuals that describe or show sexual organs or activity. Do not use

14:49.600 --> 14:54.480
language or visuals that are morbid or degrading. Avoid language or visuals that are sexual in

14:54.480 --> 14:59.920
nature. So Parler has already gone the way of Gab, where Gab just wanted to straight up ban porn.

14:59.920 --> 15:06.080
You agree to defend and indemnify Parler as well as any of its officers, directors, employees,

15:06.080 --> 15:13.840
and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities,

15:13.840 --> 15:20.480
costs or debt, and expenses, including but not limited to all attorney's fees arising from or

15:20.480 --> 15:25.520
relating to your access and use of the services. Parler will have the right to conduct its own

15:25.520 --> 15:30.800
defense at your expense in any action or proceeding covered by this indemnity.

15:30.800 --> 15:35.680
So if you post something on Parler and Parler gets in trouble for it, you're footing their bill.

15:35.680 --> 15:40.320
This is basically an inverse of the Section 230 Safe Harbor laws that allowed the modern internet

15:40.320 --> 15:45.520
to come to be in the first place. It's kind of crazy. And although it sounds strange,

15:46.160 --> 15:51.520
this is something that other social media companies have actually moved on from.

15:51.520 --> 15:57.680
For example, here's Friendster's indemnity clause from back in 2003. Yeah, remember Friendster?

15:57.680 --> 16:02.560
There's a social media site that went nowhere. But pause this and see if it looks familiar to you.

16:02.560 --> 16:09.840
Here is Facebook's indemnity clause from 2009. Here's MySpace's indemnity clause from 2006.

16:10.640 --> 16:15.840
All of these clauses were put into these websites and eventually dropped. I know Friendster doesn't

16:15.840 --> 16:20.400
exist anymore, but the clause was dropped several years before Friendster went into business.

16:20.400 --> 16:25.680
Facebook and MySpace both dropped theirs years ago as well. It could be the case that with Section

16:25.680 --> 16:30.560
230 protections in place, all of these companies felt that these clauses were no longer valid,

16:30.560 --> 16:35.840
or at least not needed. And maybe Parler is expecting Section 230 to go away, which

16:35.840 --> 16:40.560
unfortunately is on the table right now because social media companies are behaving

16:40.560 --> 16:46.080
so awfully when it comes to political censorship and being unbiased. That some people, rather than

16:46.080 --> 16:51.840
reform the system, want the nuclear option of removing Section 230, which will basically kill

16:51.840 --> 16:56.880
Google, kill Amazon, kill Facebook, kill Twitter, kill Reddit, kill them all. They'll all be gone.

16:56.880 --> 17:01.680
Because it will make them liable to millions of lawsuits. And maybe Parler sees that coming and

17:01.760 --> 17:06.480
wants to push that cost off onto its users. Maybe Parler is simply covering its bases,

17:06.480 --> 17:10.880
throwing out stuff that it knows won't stick. Maybe Parler is just being a dick. Who knows?

17:10.880 --> 17:14.320
Also, I don't know why Parler would ever have your social security number, but

17:14.320 --> 17:19.520
a clause like this never looks good. And for all the things that Parler demands of its audience,

17:19.520 --> 17:26.160
it's not even truly free speech. Conservatives are flocking to a new free speech social media app

17:26.160 --> 17:31.360
that has started banning liberal users. This is just as bad, just going the other way.

17:31.360 --> 17:37.280
We do not need an aisle flipped version of Twitter. We need a place where everyone can talk

17:37.280 --> 17:41.760
and everyone can debate and everyone can put their heads together and come up with solutions

17:41.760 --> 17:46.880
to the problems that we're facing. Hello, Sheriff Joe. Your post is in violation of our terms of

17:46.880 --> 17:54.640
service. I'm Marco Rubio. Anyone know where I can find some breast milk? My wife left me. This is in

17:54.640 --> 17:59.600
violation of obscenity. This violation has added four to your total points accumulated.

17:59.600 --> 18:05.920
Total current violation points is four. As a red or gold badge user, if your account accumulates

18:05.920 --> 18:11.040
20 points in a three month period, your account will be banned from Parler and all future

18:11.040 --> 18:17.440
services. Now that little Marco Rubio bit sounds a lot like parody to me, but because Parler thinks

18:17.440 --> 18:22.320
it's obscene, Sheriff Joe is banned. It turns out that Sheriff Joe actually is banned. It's not just

18:22.320 --> 18:26.800
four points on his card or whatever. Yeah, he's gone now. Probably for the sin of posting this

18:26.800 --> 18:32.080
publicly and humiliating Parler. But the point is, when the right whines about obscenity, it's

18:32.080 --> 18:38.480
the exact same thing as the left whining about problematic. We don't need any of that BS coming

18:38.480 --> 18:44.640
from anyone. Pretty much all of my leftist friends joined Parler to screw with MAGA folks, and every

18:44.640 --> 18:49.280
last one of them was banned in less than 24 hours because conservatives truly love free speech.

18:49.280 --> 18:53.920
They said stuff like, Dan Bongingo, you should really wash your doo-doo ass. One got banned for

18:54.000 --> 18:59.120
saying she wants to fight a police dog. Like, what the hell, man? This is no better. This is no

18:59.120 --> 19:05.600
fucking better. At this point, when it comes to social media, I'm adopting my own personal terms

19:05.600 --> 19:12.240
of service. I call it fuck it. And basically, here's what you do. You sign up for a social

19:12.240 --> 19:18.160
media account and you do whatever the fuck you want. And then when they inevitably ban you,

19:18.160 --> 19:22.880
because somebody, whether it's left, right, doesn't matter, somebody gets a stick up their ass about

19:22.880 --> 19:28.240
it, you make another one because it's free. Emails are free nowadays, social media accounts are free

19:28.240 --> 19:32.080
nowadays, it doesn't really matter. If you need a phone number, there's websites you can go where

19:32.080 --> 19:36.240
you can sign up and just get like a burner number that lasts 30 minutes, just enough to verify your

19:36.240 --> 19:40.800
account, then you get rid of the number. Same with emails, same with IPs, doesn't matter anymore.

19:40.800 --> 19:45.040
There was once a point where I was willing to actually listen to the terms of service of all

19:45.040 --> 19:49.680
of these companies, but these terms have become so oppressive that the only thing I can think of now

19:49.680 --> 19:56.320
is civil disobedience. So no, I will use these sites as much or as little as I want. I will not

19:56.320 --> 20:00.800
follow their rules and if I ever want to come back, I will make a new account and come back.

20:00.800 --> 20:06.160
And until they actually implement rules that are worth following and do not censor for any reason

20:06.160 --> 20:11.680
the users of their site, then I see no reason to abide by them. I am willing to come to the table,

20:11.680 --> 20:16.000
I am willing to bend a little bit, I am willing to follow rules that I think are reasonable,

20:16.000 --> 20:19.760
but if this is what social media is going to be, then fuck it, I'll do what I want.

20:22.320 --> 20:27.520
Hey pals, this is a quick end of video PSA. The talk on Parler's over now, so if you actually

20:27.520 --> 20:30.720
want to click away, go ahead. But I do have something else important that I want to talk

20:30.720 --> 20:36.640
about and it is related to, you know, stuff going missing online. So I've been somebody who

20:37.200 --> 20:41.680
follows a lot of YouTubers that have disappeared. Like for example, I'm on the Cinema Snobs website

20:41.680 --> 20:47.680
right now. If you were to try to go back say 10 years and watch the old, old, old Cinema Snobs,

20:47.680 --> 20:51.600
a lot of them are gone. A lot of the links on this site are dead because they were on BlipTV

20:51.600 --> 20:57.200
and BlipTV's gone. Like for example, here's his review on Caligula from 2010. There's no review

20:57.200 --> 21:02.000
here though. A lot of his old stuff is just gone, lost the time. You go to Spoonie's channel if you

21:02.000 --> 21:05.680
ever wanted to go back and see his old videos because he's not really doing anything anymore.

21:06.240 --> 21:10.160
And like if you scroll down, you'll notice after you get through all the streams,

21:10.960 --> 21:16.960
a lot of his stuff is also gone. A lot of the videos, a lot of the vlogs and the reviews,

21:16.960 --> 21:21.360
they've simply vanished. And in fact, if you want to watch Spoonie now, you have to go to channels

21:21.360 --> 21:27.520
like NotRub here who posts a lot of vlogs that again were only on BlipTV and have largely been

21:27.520 --> 21:33.520
lost as well. But he posted them here. There's a lot of old convention footage that was lost.

21:33.520 --> 21:38.240
There's a lot of commentary tracks that were lost. Basically stuff that frankly I never thought I'd

21:38.240 --> 21:44.240
be able to see again. My point is, I'm going on this wild tangent here. My point is that I never

21:44.240 --> 21:51.440
liked the idea of my own content ever being lost to time. For example, as autistic as this is,

21:51.440 --> 21:56.560
I have a hard drive where every single playthrough we've ever done over the course of the past seven

21:56.560 --> 22:02.880
years on Game Boomers, it's all here, every single playthrough. And it's also all uploaded to the

22:02.880 --> 22:08.720
Game Boomers YouTube channel. So whenever we stream on Twitch, I upload that stream as

22:08.720 --> 22:13.840
basically as like a let's play on that channel. I've got all the old anime reviews from way back

22:13.840 --> 22:21.200
in the day. There's season one of the SFO anime review, season two, and season three, they're all

22:21.200 --> 22:28.000
here. And of course, I've also got the Dumping with Scrumps. They're all here. There's a shit

22:28.000 --> 22:32.560
ton of Dumping with Scrumps now. I've got all the dev perspectives backed up. All the 10 minute

22:32.560 --> 22:38.240
takes are here. Even the really old ones from like four years ago. Point is, I save a lot of this

22:38.240 --> 22:44.080
stuff. And I do it because I don't like the idea of my content going missing one day. Everything

22:44.080 --> 22:49.680
that I have here is uploaded somewhere. If YouTube won't take it because it's like a hentai review

22:49.680 --> 22:54.400
from nine or 10 years ago, it's up on my bit shoot. I have this stuff uploaded somewhere,

22:54.400 --> 23:00.320
whether it's on SFO, on Game Boomers, on the dev kit, it exists somewhere. And I have copies

23:00.320 --> 23:02.800
of everything that we've ever done. So if something goes missing, or there's a new or

23:02.800 --> 23:07.600
there's a new platform, I'll re upload the entire backlog there too. The point is I have liked so

23:07.600 --> 23:13.440
many YouTubers whose stuff has gone missing, that I never wanted that to be a problem for me.

23:13.440 --> 23:17.440
Whether or not I make it big, if I have any fans at all who want to see my old stuff,

23:17.440 --> 23:21.920
I want it to be there. I want it to be available so that somebody can spend a lazy Saturday

23:21.920 --> 23:26.240
afternoon watching old YouTube videos from 10 years ago that they're kind of being half

23:26.240 --> 23:30.320
nostalgic about. Maybe they just discovered it, whatever. I want that stuff to be available.

23:30.320 --> 23:34.880
That is important to me, even though it sounds kind of autistic. And then I had kind of a problem

23:35.440 --> 23:41.520
because as you can see, this is a playlist on my Game Boomers YouTube from the Goof Troop

23:41.520 --> 23:47.200
playthrough that I did with BLG, Born Losers Gaming. All the videos are privated, except

23:47.760 --> 23:53.040
I was smart enough to save them and I re uploaded them to my channel. So here they are in the

23:53.040 --> 23:57.200
playlist. If you just scroll down a little bit, I did not exactly want to reveal this,

23:57.200 --> 24:03.360
but the preservation of my content, I personally find to be a higher order value than the whole

24:03.360 --> 24:08.080
cancel culture thing. But basically when I was talking about people who had thrown me out of

24:08.080 --> 24:12.960
their discord in the cancel culture video last week, it was these guys and they are a reasonably

24:12.960 --> 24:17.840
small let's play channel. And back when I was a reasonably small let's play channel,

24:17.840 --> 24:22.160
we had done crossovers in like 2015 or something, and they decided to delete the crossovers,

24:23.120 --> 24:26.320
but I saved them and they're here and they're available for you to watch.

24:27.200 --> 24:34.320
Now it would be a personal favor to me if you manage to get more than 400 hits on this part one,

24:35.920 --> 24:40.000
because that is all they managed to get on their channel. And that, but that's just a little petty

24:40.000 --> 24:43.440
goal for me. It doesn't actually mean anything if you don't, if you don't click on it. And if

24:43.440 --> 24:48.640
you do want to give it a click, the playlist will be in the description of, of, uh, of this video.

24:48.640 --> 24:52.400
But that's not really my point. My point is, is that I don't like my stuff going missing.

24:52.400 --> 24:57.200
Um, there isn't, there's another play through that we did that was, um, only one episode that

24:57.200 --> 25:02.320
I have lost unfortunately, and I'm not happy about it. It was an episode of golf with your friends

25:02.320 --> 25:06.560
that's gone. Um, but it frankly, it wasn't very good. The goof shoot play through is actually

25:06.560 --> 25:11.280
not bad. And we also recorded several things that never came out because the guys over at BLG just

25:11.280 --> 25:14.960
didn't want to edit them. There was a secret of mana play through, and there was some Mario Kart

25:14.960 --> 25:19.280
eight stuff that they, they never edited. I never got the footage from them. And it's,

25:19.280 --> 25:22.000
it's probably never going to come out now because those guys hate me because they've all gone

25:22.800 --> 25:27.600
radical left, you know, off the cliff. But yeah, some people actually messaged me and asked, Hey,

25:27.600 --> 25:33.840
how come, uh, all these random episodes that are not in your usual game Boomer style are coming

25:33.840 --> 25:37.520
out on your channel? Well, this is why, and if you feel like doing me a favor, you know,

25:37.520 --> 25:40.880
give that part one, a click, maybe, maybe you'll like the video. Who knows? Anyway,

25:40.880 --> 25:46.560
I'm going to get out of here. The Chaz video will come soon. TM. Oh, and I'll see you on my Twitch

25:46.560 --> 25:49.600
stream tonight. If you want, we're going to play some final fantasy seven. Anyway,

25:49.600 --> 25:52.800
thanks for indulging me. I'll talk to you later. I love you.
