1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Hey buddies! This is not going to be a full anti-social media video,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,040
although I'll probably still put it in the anti-social media playlist.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,720
But today we're talking about Parler! And yes, I am over on Parler, under short fat otaku as

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,720
always. I haven't really customized it, I should probably do that. And Parler is basically a

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,280
Twitter replacement. They have a few other features, for example the comments underneath

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,360
individual posts kind of branch out as more and more people talk about them. It's a little bit

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,280
easier to follow. You can post more than, what is it, 240 characters? Twitter's character limit?

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,960
You can post more than that. And probably most importantly of all,

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,080
Parler is marketed as a free speech alternative. Now where have we heard that before?

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,920
But a couple of weeks ago, Parler started really blowing up, and I'm talking like

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,640
half a million new accounts in just a couple of days blowing up, because of the hashtag

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,560
TWEGSIT. And if you go to twegsit.com, you're greeted with this page.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,520
Dear Jack, you've abused us for the last time. Censorship stinks. I'm out and I'm taking my

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,600
friends with me. Reject censorship and exit Twitter. Read the open letter to Jack Dorsey,

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,400
Twitter CEO. Join the TWEGSIT movement. And then it gives you a few links here you can click on.

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,200
These will basically fast track your Parler account creation. And here's that open letter.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,760
Dear Jack, I want to thank you, not only on behalf of Parler, but also on behalf of the

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,560
hundreds of millions of Americans to whom you have now, at last, made abundantly clear that

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,240
Twitter is not their form. It's your form, where your left-wing views predominate, and theirs are

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,440
only allowed if they properly align with your own radical political bias. By using the notoriously

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,280
left-wing CNN and Washington Post to fact-check the President of the United States, you removed

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,840
any remaining doubt as to where you stand, and the utter disdain you hold for those who dare to

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,400
disagree. Frankly, you inadvertently conceded this on CNN nearly 18 months ago, where you proudly

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,200
boasted that Twitter is left-leaning. You then absurdly tried to cover your tracks when you

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,800
hastily added, but we do not look at content with regards to political viewpoint or ideology,

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,320
we look at behaviour. Yes, behaviour like daring to depart from the liberal Twitter orthodoxy,

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,960
but of course your top aid is responsible for election security and misinformation,

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,560
UL Roth had already let the cat out of the bag when he proclaimed in January 2017 that there

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,080
are actual Nazis in the Trump White House. By the way, did you get CNN and the Washington Post to

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,360
fact-check that claim? So now, with your latest assault of President Trump, and more importantly,

31
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,560
freedom of speech, you have, as I said, removed any remaining doubt as to your rigid left-wing

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,240
ideology, your bitter contempt for those who aren't buying what you're selling,

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,520
and your full-blown, full-bore intention to rid Twitter of even the most remote semblance of free

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,720
speech once and for all. So thank you, Jack. Thank you for slamming shut the portals of Twitter,

35
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,200
as we throw open the door to Parler. Your stock is plunging, your followership is tanking,

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,840
and Parler is skyrocketing. So stop by and say hello on your way down, and on our way up.

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,760
At Parler, we still wholeheartedly believe in freedom of speech.

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,520
Sincerely, John Matze, CEO and member of Parler.

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,440
P.S. At Parler, we also respect our members' privacy, their personal data,

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,760
and their content as it's not sold to the highest bidder.

41
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,320
The twigzit is here. Okay, so that is basically how Parler is spinning this. They're talking about

42
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,000
the increasing left-wing bias on Twitter, and yes, there is an increasing left-wing bias on Twitter,

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,800
no one can honestly deny that, and how that is infringing now on freedom of speech.

44
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,120
Of course, the reply to this is fundamentally an ANCAP one, which is why it's really funny to

45
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,800
hear it come out of lefties' mouths. Twitter is their own company, they can do whatever they want.

46
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:47,200
The left has no problem with forcing companies to do things that they find to be morally acceptable,

47
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,720
but in this one case, no, they're interfering with capitalism. You guys don't give a shit

48
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,160
about capitalism, it's all just empty rhetoric from them. But nonetheless, let's talk about

49
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,640
what Twitter actually did. Here's Donald Trump's Twitter feed, scrolled all the way back to June

50
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,320
23rd, and I gotta admit, that was a lot of scrolling to do. And check out this tweet!

51
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,840
This tweet violated the Twitter rules about abusive behavior. However, Twitter has determined

52
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
that it may be in the public's interest for the tweet to remain accessible. It has no replies,

53
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,200
no retweets, no favorites. It cannot be interacted with in any way, it can only be viewed.

54
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,720
Now before I even open this tweet up, the way that Twitter is framing this is completely false.

55
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,760
Twitter has not determined that it may be in the public's interest. Twitter is being told to do

56
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,480
this by the Supreme Court. All official correspondence by the president is to be

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,640
kept as public record. This has been affirmed by the Supreme Court multiple times. It's one of the

58
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,120
reasons why Donald Trump can't block anybody on Twitter either. So no, if you actually tried to

59
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,080
delete this tweet, I'm sure you'd have a lawsuit on your hands, that's why you're doing it.

60
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,920
If somebody else tweeted this, they'd probably get banned. Actually no, so many people are tweeting

61
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,520
what the contents of this tweet are now. It's kind of become its own meme, and they're not getting

62
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,360
banned because there's too many of them. Let's view it anyway. There will never be an autonomous

63
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,000
zone in Washington DC as long as I'm your president. If they try, they will be met with

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,400
serious force. Is that abusive behavior? Is it abusive to say that you're going to defend against

65
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,560
anarcho-communists who try to establish autonomous zones in American cities? That you're going to

66
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,680
prevent the erection of such zones in order to actually maintain law and order within them?

67
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,520
In order to guarantee the human rights of those people who would live in that zone?

68
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,840
Let me get this straight, Twitter. Securing people's natural rights under the law is abusive

69
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,640
to you. It is not necessarily the fact that Twitter has been putting this little interstitial

70
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,880
here over top of Trump's tweets, though that is part of it. What really kicked off the whole

71
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,600
parlor thing was putting it on this tweet specifically, on how blatantly partisan this was.

72
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,280
Being anti-communist revolution and declaring your intent to defend yourself and defend those around

73
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,040
you. Twitter considers that to be abusive. If that is not partisan hackery, I don't know what is.

74
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,640
And because Twitter has gone off the deep end regarding banning anyone who is not hard left,

75
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,280
yeah, there's going to be a lot of conservatives showing up on these non-Twitter sites, not just

76
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,120
Parlor, but also Minds and Gab. And funnily enough, on Laura Loomer's site, there's a list

77
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,800
of conservative accounts to follow on Parlor. And this list really is a who's who of the deplatformed

78
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,040
right now. You have Milo, Gavin McInnis, The Proud Boys, Laura Loomer herself, Info Wars,

79
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:31,840
Alex Jones, Faith Goldie, Nick Fuentes, Zero Hedge, Sargon, Sargon's on there, Tommy Robinson,

80
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,160
Adam Baldwin, Rand Paul, Mike Cernovich, James O'Keefe, Project Veritas, Daily Caller.

81
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,600
You know, a lot of people that I do disagree with regularly. However, I would not want to see them

82
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,960
deplatformed. Oh God, QAnon is on there. Okay. But the point is, I wouldn't want to see these

83
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,760
people deplatformed, even though I disagree with almost everything with someone like Nick Fuentes

84
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,440
or whatever. I don't want to see them kicked off a site. Not because they haven't done anything

85
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,480
wrong, man. It's still free speech, but Twitter does not care about free speech anymore. Let's

86
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,480
not kid ourselves, guys. Parlor isn't perfect. There are some serious problems with it.

87
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:12,800
Here's an oft cited thread by Mark Doppelganger. The Mbased and Red Pilled Parlor app requires

88
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,560
providing phone number to message people over the internet. Privacy, safety, freedom of speech,

89
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,840
phone number. Miss me with this glowing stuff. Now, that's actually pretty bad, but it doesn't

90
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,720
make it any worse than other websites. Have you noticed that Twitter requires a phone number now?

91
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,080
Have you noticed that Facebook does? In fact, Facebook requires a picture of your photo ID

92
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,800
sometimes. If your name is like a non-standard name, or if you put in a nickname or something,

93
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,280
it will require you to post a picture of photo ID to make sure you're a real person.

94
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,520
I know I'm an old man. In fact, I just did a video on being an old man,

95
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,000
but man, do I recall and on some level miss the times when people were saying,

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,600
don't post your real information on the internet. Then someone can find you. Some creep will look

97
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,840
you up. Don't post your phone number. Don't post your address. Don't post your real name.

98
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,000
I would love to go back to those times. I would love to go back to the times of anonymous accounts

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
on IRC or something. This is not good for Parler, but it's still on par with everything else. I'd

100
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,400
say it's even on Parler. And here's Parler's terms of service. Parler may remove any content

101
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,840
and terminate access to services at any time for any reason or no reason. Although Parler

102
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,200
endeavors to allow all free speech that is lawful and does not infringe the legal rights of others.

103
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,360
Any invitation made by Parler to you to use the services or submit content to the services,

104
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,160
or the fact that Parler may receive a benefit from your use of the services or provision of

105
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,080
content to the services will not obligate Parler to maintain any content or maintain your access

106
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,200
to the services. Parler will have no liability to you for removing any content for terminating your

107
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,160
access to the services or for modifying or terminating the services at any time and in any

108
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,440
way and for any reason or no reason. Although the Parler guidelines provide guidance to you regarding

109
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,000
content that is not appropriate, Parler is free to remove content and terminate your access to the

110
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,200
services even where the guidelines have been followed. Now this actually sounds quite bad,

111
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,120
and on some level it is quite bad, but there's a few spots where I kind of get it.

112
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,320
For example, when you read the part where it says Parler is not obligated to maintain your

113
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,120
access to the services, that makes sense. Because if you lose your internet package or something,

114
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,520
Parler is not responsible for getting you back on Parler. This basically reads like

115
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,360
you are using Parler's property at their whim. And that does sound really bad, but as long as

116
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,120
their whim is free speech, then you basically just have to trust them. Like it's kind of bad,

117
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,000
but there's no other way they'd word this without putting themselves in some kind of legal loophole

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,880
where if they wanted to like close down the site one day they wouldn't be able to do so, you know?

119
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,440
I think that I think this is like standard legalese. That sucks, don't get me wrong,

120
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,080
it's not good, but it's also par for the course, and no I won't make the pun again.

121
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,840
The terms of this user agreement may be modified by Parler in any way and at any time without

122
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,840
notice to you, and you agree to be responsible for making yourself aware of any modification

123
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,760
of the terms and to be bound by any modification of the terms when you continue to access or use

124
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,320
the services after any such modification. This is, again, a spot where Twitter had them beat,

125
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,360
because when Twitter started updating its hate speech policy, it refused to alter really old

126
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,480
tweets, like stuff from 2012 or whatever, I think it was 2017 or 2015 or something along those

127
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,520
lines, when the new policy came into effect, all the tweets from before that era would not be

128
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,080
affected. Unlike on YouTube, where 10 year old videos are getting struck down constantly for

129
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,320
violating the terms of service or the community guidelines or whatever the fuck it is, videos

130
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,600
that are in no way relevant and were completely in line with the terms back then. If you permit us to

131
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,240
access the address book on your device or give us permission to import your contacts from an email

132
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,120
account associated with your account, we may access and store names and contact information

133
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,200
from your address book to facilitate invitations and social interactions that you initiate through

134
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,920
our services and for other purposes described in this privacy policy or at the time of consent of

135
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,120
collection. I mean this one seems easy, don't give them access to that shit. Unless, for some dumb

136
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,080
fuck reason, Parler requires access to your contacts list just to use it, that would be

137
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,720
ridiculous, but I'm on Parler, I haven't been asked anything like that. You can delete your

138
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,520
account by emailing us your request at account.deletion at parler.com. You can't just delete it

139
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:31,120
in the account settings, you have to email them. I mean that's kind of lame, but fine. You agree to

140
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,440
receive communications from Parler, including communication sent by phone, email, text message,

141
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,760
other means of communication. If you provided a phone number to Parler, you are required to notify

142
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,040
Parler when you cease to own or control that number to help prevent Parler from sending

143
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,520
communications to others who may acquire that number. Alright, so you are forced to accept their

144
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,360
spam. That sucks, but it's just kind of annoying, you know. You agree to arbitrate any dispute that

145
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,960
you have with Parler. You agree to resolve all disputes with Parler through binding arbitration

146
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,920
with the American Arbitration Association in Clark County, Nevada, unless the dispute meets

147
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,960
the requirements for small claims court and is filed in Justice Court Henderson, Clark County,

148
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:15,440
Nevada. If for any reason this agreement to arbitrate is determined by a court or arbitrator

149
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,160
to be unenforceable, you agree that the federal and state courts with jurisdiction over Clark

150
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,240
County, Nevada will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute involving you and Parler.

151
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,080
Any arbitration will be governed by the AAA commercial arbitration rules, consumer due process

152
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,560
protocol, and supplementary procedures for resolution of consumer-related disputes.

153
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,600
The arbitration will be conducted only by telephone, online, or based solely on written

154
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,160
submissions and not by personal appearance of any party or witness. This user agreement

155
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,880
and any dispute between you and Parler will be governed by the laws of the state of Nevada,

156
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,880
excluding any applicable choice of law provision. Up until this point, things have seemed lame but

157
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,240
normal for a social media site like Parler. I don't know if Twitter or Facebook or anybody else has

158
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,800
a clause like this, but this is absolutely ridiculous. This means simply by using Parler,

159
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,480
if you ever have reason to sue Parler, any reason at all, you can't. You have to arbitrate with

160
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,440
them. You cannot join a class action lawsuit. You cannot file a claim against them. You can only

161
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,360
arbitrate. Now, I've seen similar clauses like this in the past, and they almost always get

162
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,840
thrown out as unenforceable. And I'm pretty sure that this clause here, where if it turns out this

163
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,080
whole thing is unenforceable, you have to agree to their jurisdiction. I don't know if that's

164
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,640
enforceable either. Who knows? But the point is, this is basically them trying to do as much of a

165
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,720
power grab as they can, saying that, oh, if you use our service, you can't sue us. Even if we

166
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,880
fuck you, you can't sue us. And even though this type of thing hasn't rendered unenforceable,

167
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,000
it is going to scare a lot of people away. People who might actually have a legitimate

168
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,800
grievance against Parler, maybe because they just don't know any better, or they don't want

169
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,600
to go through the extra step of trying to overcome this before even filing their case, you know?

170
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,160
Do not purposefully share rumors about other users and people you know are false. Well,

171
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,240
that might be kind of hard. What if you actually think that it's true, and then it turns out you

172
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,960
were wrong? What if you change your mind? What if Parler thinks you're lying? Avoid targeting

173
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,760
red or no-badged users with disparaging information. They are more protected under

174
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,040
the law than prominent individuals. More protected under the law? Is it because users with certain

175
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,600
badges are like public figures or something? I mean, the whole point of social media, one of

176
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,360
the big boons and big drawbacks of social media, is that the minute that you post on social media,

177
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,120
you also become a public figure. It doesn't matter if you have five followers, you're still posting

178
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,320
something publicly. Pornography is considered indecent according to clauses defined by the FCC.

179
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,600
Do not use language or visuals that describe or show sexual organs or activity. Do not use

180
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,480
language or visuals that are morbid or degrading. Avoid language or visuals that are sexual in

181
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,920
nature. So Parler has already gone the way of Gab, where Gab just wanted to straight up ban porn.

182
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,080
You agree to defend and indemnify Parler as well as any of its officers, directors, employees,

183
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:13,840
and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities,

184
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:20,480
costs or debt, and expenses, including but not limited to all attorney's fees arising from or

185
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,520
relating to your access and use of the services. Parler will have the right to conduct its own

186
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,800
defense at your expense in any action or proceeding covered by this indemnity.

187
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,680
So if you post something on Parler and Parler gets in trouble for it, you're footing their bill.

188
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,320
This is basically an inverse of the Section 230 Safe Harbor laws that allowed the modern internet

189
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,520
to come to be in the first place. It's kind of crazy. And although it sounds strange,

190
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,520
this is something that other social media companies have actually moved on from.

191
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,680
For example, here's Friendster's indemnity clause from back in 2003. Yeah, remember Friendster?

192
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,560
There's a social media site that went nowhere. But pause this and see if it looks familiar to you.

193
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,840
Here is Facebook's indemnity clause from 2009. Here's MySpace's indemnity clause from 2006.

194
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,840
All of these clauses were put into these websites and eventually dropped. I know Friendster doesn't

195
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,400
exist anymore, but the clause was dropped several years before Friendster went into business.

196
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,680
Facebook and MySpace both dropped theirs years ago as well. It could be the case that with Section

197
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,560
230 protections in place, all of these companies felt that these clauses were no longer valid,

198
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,840
or at least not needed. And maybe Parler is expecting Section 230 to go away, which

199
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,560
unfortunately is on the table right now because social media companies are behaving

200
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,080
so awfully when it comes to political censorship and being unbiased. That some people, rather than

201
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,840
reform the system, want the nuclear option of removing Section 230, which will basically kill

202
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,880
Google, kill Amazon, kill Facebook, kill Twitter, kill Reddit, kill them all. They'll all be gone.

203
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,680
Because it will make them liable to millions of lawsuits. And maybe Parler sees that coming and

204
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,480
wants to push that cost off onto its users. Maybe Parler is simply covering its bases,

205
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,880
throwing out stuff that it knows won't stick. Maybe Parler is just being a dick. Who knows?

206
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,320
Also, I don't know why Parler would ever have your social security number, but

207
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,520
a clause like this never looks good. And for all the things that Parler demands of its audience,

208
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:26,160
it's not even truly free speech. Conservatives are flocking to a new free speech social media app

209
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,360
that has started banning liberal users. This is just as bad, just going the other way.

210
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,280
We do not need an aisle flipped version of Twitter. We need a place where everyone can talk

211
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,760
and everyone can debate and everyone can put their heads together and come up with solutions

212
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,880
to the problems that we're facing. Hello, Sheriff Joe. Your post is in violation of our terms of

213
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:54,640
service. I'm Marco Rubio. Anyone know where I can find some breast milk? My wife left me. This is in

214
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,600
violation of obscenity. This violation has added four to your total points accumulated.

215
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,920
Total current violation points is four. As a red or gold badge user, if your account accumulates

216
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,040
20 points in a three month period, your account will be banned from Parler and all future

217
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:17,440
services. Now that little Marco Rubio bit sounds a lot like parody to me, but because Parler thinks

218
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,320
it's obscene, Sheriff Joe is banned. It turns out that Sheriff Joe actually is banned. It's not just

219
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,800
four points on his card or whatever. Yeah, he's gone now. Probably for the sin of posting this

220
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,080
publicly and humiliating Parler. But the point is, when the right whines about obscenity, it's

221
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,480
the exact same thing as the left whining about problematic. We don't need any of that BS coming

222
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,640
from anyone. Pretty much all of my leftist friends joined Parler to screw with MAGA folks, and every

223
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,280
last one of them was banned in less than 24 hours because conservatives truly love free speech.

224
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,920
They said stuff like, Dan Bongingo, you should really wash your doo-doo ass. One got banned for

225
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,120
saying she wants to fight a police dog. Like, what the hell, man? This is no better. This is no

226
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,600
fucking better. At this point, when it comes to social media, I'm adopting my own personal terms

227
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,240
of service. I call it fuck it. And basically, here's what you do. You sign up for a social

228
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,160
media account and you do whatever the fuck you want. And then when they inevitably ban you,

229
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,880
because somebody, whether it's left, right, doesn't matter, somebody gets a stick up their ass about

230
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,240
it, you make another one because it's free. Emails are free nowadays, social media accounts are free

231
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,080
nowadays, it doesn't really matter. If you need a phone number, there's websites you can go where

232
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,240
you can sign up and just get like a burner number that lasts 30 minutes, just enough to verify your

233
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,800
account, then you get rid of the number. Same with emails, same with IPs, doesn't matter anymore.

234
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,040
There was once a point where I was willing to actually listen to the terms of service of all

235
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,680
of these companies, but these terms have become so oppressive that the only thing I can think of now

236
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:56,320
is civil disobedience. So no, I will use these sites as much or as little as I want. I will not

237
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,800
follow their rules and if I ever want to come back, I will make a new account and come back.

238
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,160
And until they actually implement rules that are worth following and do not censor for any reason

239
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,680
the users of their site, then I see no reason to abide by them. I am willing to come to the table,

240
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,000
I am willing to bend a little bit, I am willing to follow rules that I think are reasonable,

241
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,760
but if this is what social media is going to be, then fuck it, I'll do what I want.

242
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,520
Hey pals, this is a quick end of video PSA. The talk on Parler's over now, so if you actually

243
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,720
want to click away, go ahead. But I do have something else important that I want to talk

244
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,640
about and it is related to, you know, stuff going missing online. So I've been somebody who

245
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,680
follows a lot of YouTubers that have disappeared. Like for example, I'm on the Cinema Snobs website

246
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,680
right now. If you were to try to go back say 10 years and watch the old, old, old Cinema Snobs,

247
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,600
a lot of them are gone. A lot of the links on this site are dead because they were on BlipTV

248
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,200
and BlipTV's gone. Like for example, here's his review on Caligula from 2010. There's no review

249
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,000
here though. A lot of his old stuff is just gone, lost the time. You go to Spoonie's channel if you

250
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,680
ever wanted to go back and see his old videos because he's not really doing anything anymore.

251
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,160
And like if you scroll down, you'll notice after you get through all the streams,

252
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,960
a lot of his stuff is also gone. A lot of the videos, a lot of the vlogs and the reviews,

253
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,360
they've simply vanished. And in fact, if you want to watch Spoonie now, you have to go to channels

254
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,520
like NotRub here who posts a lot of vlogs that again were only on BlipTV and have largely been

255
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,520
lost as well. But he posted them here. There's a lot of old convention footage that was lost.

256
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,240
There's a lot of commentary tracks that were lost. Basically stuff that frankly I never thought I'd

257
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,240
be able to see again. My point is, I'm going on this wild tangent here. My point is that I never

258
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:51,440
liked the idea of my own content ever being lost to time. For example, as autistic as this is,

259
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,560
I have a hard drive where every single playthrough we've ever done over the course of the past seven

260
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,880
years on Game Boomers, it's all here, every single playthrough. And it's also all uploaded to the

261
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,720
Game Boomers YouTube channel. So whenever we stream on Twitch, I upload that stream as

262
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,840
basically as like a let's play on that channel. I've got all the old anime reviews from way back

263
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:21,200
in the day. There's season one of the SFO anime review, season two, and season three, they're all

264
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,000
here. And of course, I've also got the Dumping with Scrumps. They're all here. There's a shit

265
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,560
ton of Dumping with Scrumps now. I've got all the dev perspectives backed up. All the 10 minute

266
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:38,240
takes are here. Even the really old ones from like four years ago. Point is, I save a lot of this

267
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,080
stuff. And I do it because I don't like the idea of my content going missing one day. Everything

268
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,680
that I have here is uploaded somewhere. If YouTube won't take it because it's like a hentai review

269
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,400
from nine or 10 years ago, it's up on my bit shoot. I have this stuff uploaded somewhere,

270
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,320
whether it's on SFO, on Game Boomers, on the dev kit, it exists somewhere. And I have copies

271
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,800
of everything that we've ever done. So if something goes missing, or there's a new or

272
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,600
there's a new platform, I'll re upload the entire backlog there too. The point is I have liked so

273
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,440
many YouTubers whose stuff has gone missing, that I never wanted that to be a problem for me.

274
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Whether or not I make it big, if I have any fans at all who want to see my old stuff,

275
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,920
I want it to be there. I want it to be available so that somebody can spend a lazy Saturday

276
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,240
afternoon watching old YouTube videos from 10 years ago that they're kind of being half

277
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,320
nostalgic about. Maybe they just discovered it, whatever. I want that stuff to be available.

278
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,880
That is important to me, even though it sounds kind of autistic. And then I had kind of a problem

279
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,520
because as you can see, this is a playlist on my Game Boomers YouTube from the Goof Troop

280
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,200
playthrough that I did with BLG, Born Losers Gaming. All the videos are privated, except

281
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,040
I was smart enough to save them and I re uploaded them to my channel. So here they are in the

282
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,200
playlist. If you just scroll down a little bit, I did not exactly want to reveal this,

283
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,360
but the preservation of my content, I personally find to be a higher order value than the whole

284
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,080
cancel culture thing. But basically when I was talking about people who had thrown me out of

285
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,960
their discord in the cancel culture video last week, it was these guys and they are a reasonably

286
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,840
small let's play channel. And back when I was a reasonably small let's play channel,

287
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,160
we had done crossovers in like 2015 or something, and they decided to delete the crossovers,

288
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,320
but I saved them and they're here and they're available for you to watch.

289
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:34,320
Now it would be a personal favor to me if you manage to get more than 400 hits on this part one,

290
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,000
because that is all they managed to get on their channel. And that, but that's just a little petty

291
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,440
goal for me. It doesn't actually mean anything if you don't, if you don't click on it. And if

292
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,640
you do want to give it a click, the playlist will be in the description of, of, uh, of this video.

293
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,400
But that's not really my point. My point is, is that I don't like my stuff going missing.

294
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,200
Um, there isn't, there's another play through that we did that was, um, only one episode that

295
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,320
I have lost unfortunately, and I'm not happy about it. It was an episode of golf with your friends

296
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,560
that's gone. Um, but it frankly, it wasn't very good. The goof shoot play through is actually

297
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,280
not bad. And we also recorded several things that never came out because the guys over at BLG just

298
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,960
didn't want to edit them. There was a secret of mana play through, and there was some Mario Kart

299
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,280
eight stuff that they, they never edited. I never got the footage from them. And it's,

300
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,000
it's probably never going to come out now because those guys hate me because they've all gone

301
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,600
radical left, you know, off the cliff. But yeah, some people actually messaged me and asked, Hey,

302
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,840
how come, uh, all these random episodes that are not in your usual game Boomer style are coming

303
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,520
out on your channel? Well, this is why, and if you feel like doing me a favor, you know,

304
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,880
give that part one, a click, maybe, maybe you'll like the video. Who knows? Anyway,

305
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,560
I'm going to get out of here. The Chaz video will come soon. TM. Oh, and I'll see you on my Twitch

306
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,600
stream tonight. If you want, we're going to play some final fantasy seven. Anyway,

307
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,800
thanks for indulging me. I'll talk to you later. I love you.
