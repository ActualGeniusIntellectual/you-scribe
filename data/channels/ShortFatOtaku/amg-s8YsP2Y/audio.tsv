0	3840	Hey buddies! This is not going to be a full anti-social media video,
3840	7040	although I'll probably still put it in the anti-social media playlist.
7040	12720	But today we're talking about Parler! And yes, I am over on Parler, under short fat otaku as
12720	18720	always. I haven't really customized it, I should probably do that. And Parler is basically a
18720	23280	Twitter replacement. They have a few other features, for example the comments underneath
23280	27360	individual posts kind of branch out as more and more people talk about them. It's a little bit
27360	33280	easier to follow. You can post more than, what is it, 240 characters? Twitter's character limit?
33280	36960	You can post more than that. And probably most importantly of all,
36960	42080	Parler is marketed as a free speech alternative. Now where have we heard that before?
42080	45920	But a couple of weeks ago, Parler started really blowing up, and I'm talking like
45920	50640	half a million new accounts in just a couple of days blowing up, because of the hashtag
50640	54560	TWEGSIT. And if you go to twegsit.com, you're greeted with this page.
55280	61520	Dear Jack, you've abused us for the last time. Censorship stinks. I'm out and I'm taking my
61520	67600	friends with me. Reject censorship and exit Twitter. Read the open letter to Jack Dorsey,
67600	72400	Twitter CEO. Join the TWEGSIT movement. And then it gives you a few links here you can click on.
72400	77200	These will basically fast track your Parler account creation. And here's that open letter.
77280	81760	Dear Jack, I want to thank you, not only on behalf of Parler, but also on behalf of the
81760	86560	hundreds of millions of Americans to whom you have now, at last, made abundantly clear that
86560	92240	Twitter is not their form. It's your form, where your left-wing views predominate, and theirs are
92240	97440	only allowed if they properly align with your own radical political bias. By using the notoriously
97440	103280	left-wing CNN and Washington Post to fact-check the President of the United States, you removed
103280	107840	any remaining doubt as to where you stand, and the utter disdain you hold for those who dare to
107840	114400	disagree. Frankly, you inadvertently conceded this on CNN nearly 18 months ago, where you proudly
114400	119200	boasted that Twitter is left-leaning. You then absurdly tried to cover your tracks when you
119200	124800	hastily added, but we do not look at content with regards to political viewpoint or ideology,
124800	130320	we look at behaviour. Yes, behaviour like daring to depart from the liberal Twitter orthodoxy,
130320	134960	but of course your top aid is responsible for election security and misinformation,
134960	140560	UL Roth had already let the cat out of the bag when he proclaimed in January 2017 that there
140560	146080	are actual Nazis in the Trump White House. By the way, did you get CNN and the Washington Post to
146080	151360	fact-check that claim? So now, with your latest assault of President Trump, and more importantly,
151360	156560	freedom of speech, you have, as I said, removed any remaining doubt as to your rigid left-wing
156560	160240	ideology, your bitter contempt for those who aren't buying what you're selling,
160240	165520	and your full-blown, full-bore intention to rid Twitter of even the most remote semblance of free
165520	170720	speech once and for all. So thank you, Jack. Thank you for slamming shut the portals of Twitter,
170720	175200	as we throw open the door to Parler. Your stock is plunging, your followership is tanking,
175200	179840	and Parler is skyrocketing. So stop by and say hello on your way down, and on our way up.
180560	183760	At Parler, we still wholeheartedly believe in freedom of speech.
184480	189520	Sincerely, John Matze, CEO and member of Parler.
189520	193440	P.S. At Parler, we also respect our members' privacy, their personal data,
193440	195760	and their content as it's not sold to the highest bidder.
195760	202320	The twigzit is here. Okay, so that is basically how Parler is spinning this. They're talking about
202880	208000	the increasing left-wing bias on Twitter, and yes, there is an increasing left-wing bias on Twitter,
208000	212800	no one can honestly deny that, and how that is infringing now on freedom of speech.
212800	217120	Of course, the reply to this is fundamentally an ANCAP one, which is why it's really funny to
217120	220800	hear it come out of lefties' mouths. Twitter is their own company, they can do whatever they want.
221600	227200	The left has no problem with forcing companies to do things that they find to be morally acceptable,
227200	230720	but in this one case, no, they're interfering with capitalism. You guys don't give a shit
230720	234160	about capitalism, it's all just empty rhetoric from them. But nonetheless, let's talk about
234160	238640	what Twitter actually did. Here's Donald Trump's Twitter feed, scrolled all the way back to June
238640	242320	23rd, and I gotta admit, that was a lot of scrolling to do. And check out this tweet!
242880	247840	This tweet violated the Twitter rules about abusive behavior. However, Twitter has determined
247840	252640	that it may be in the public's interest for the tweet to remain accessible. It has no replies,
252640	257200	no retweets, no favorites. It cannot be interacted with in any way, it can only be viewed.
257200	262720	Now before I even open this tweet up, the way that Twitter is framing this is completely false.
262720	267760	Twitter has not determined that it may be in the public's interest. Twitter is being told to do
267760	272480	this by the Supreme Court. All official correspondence by the president is to be
272480	276640	kept as public record. This has been affirmed by the Supreme Court multiple times. It's one of the
276640	281120	reasons why Donald Trump can't block anybody on Twitter either. So no, if you actually tried to
281120	284080	delete this tweet, I'm sure you'd have a lawsuit on your hands, that's why you're doing it.
284080	287920	If somebody else tweeted this, they'd probably get banned. Actually no, so many people are tweeting
287920	291520	what the contents of this tweet are now. It's kind of become its own meme, and they're not getting
291520	295360	banned because there's too many of them. Let's view it anyway. There will never be an autonomous
295360	300000	zone in Washington DC as long as I'm your president. If they try, they will be met with
300000	306400	serious force. Is that abusive behavior? Is it abusive to say that you're going to defend against
306400	312560	anarcho-communists who try to establish autonomous zones in American cities? That you're going to
312560	317680	prevent the erection of such zones in order to actually maintain law and order within them?
317680	321520	In order to guarantee the human rights of those people who would live in that zone?
321520	327840	Let me get this straight, Twitter. Securing people's natural rights under the law is abusive
327840	334640	to you. It is not necessarily the fact that Twitter has been putting this little interstitial
334640	338880	here over top of Trump's tweets, though that is part of it. What really kicked off the whole
338880	345600	parlor thing was putting it on this tweet specifically, on how blatantly partisan this was.
345600	351280	Being anti-communist revolution and declaring your intent to defend yourself and defend those around
352080	357040	you. Twitter considers that to be abusive. If that is not partisan hackery, I don't know what is.
357040	362640	And because Twitter has gone off the deep end regarding banning anyone who is not hard left,
362640	367280	yeah, there's going to be a lot of conservatives showing up on these non-Twitter sites, not just
367280	373120	Parlor, but also Minds and Gab. And funnily enough, on Laura Loomer's site, there's a list
373120	378800	of conservative accounts to follow on Parlor. And this list really is a who's who of the deplatformed
378880	385040	right now. You have Milo, Gavin McInnis, The Proud Boys, Laura Loomer herself, Info Wars,
385040	391840	Alex Jones, Faith Goldie, Nick Fuentes, Zero Hedge, Sargon, Sargon's on there, Tommy Robinson,
391840	398160	Adam Baldwin, Rand Paul, Mike Cernovich, James O'Keefe, Project Veritas, Daily Caller.
398160	403600	You know, a lot of people that I do disagree with regularly. However, I would not want to see them
403600	408960	deplatformed. Oh God, QAnon is on there. Okay. But the point is, I wouldn't want to see these
408960	413760	people deplatformed, even though I disagree with almost everything with someone like Nick Fuentes
413760	417440	or whatever. I don't want to see them kicked off a site. Not because they haven't done anything
417440	422480	wrong, man. It's still free speech, but Twitter does not care about free speech anymore. Let's
422480	426480	not kid ourselves, guys. Parlor isn't perfect. There are some serious problems with it.
426480	432800	Here's an oft cited thread by Mark Doppelganger. The Mbased and Red Pilled Parlor app requires
432800	438560	providing phone number to message people over the internet. Privacy, safety, freedom of speech,
438560	443840	phone number. Miss me with this glowing stuff. Now, that's actually pretty bad, but it doesn't
443840	448720	make it any worse than other websites. Have you noticed that Twitter requires a phone number now?
448720	454080	Have you noticed that Facebook does? In fact, Facebook requires a picture of your photo ID
454080	458800	sometimes. If your name is like a non-standard name, or if you put in a nickname or something,
458800	463280	it will require you to post a picture of photo ID to make sure you're a real person.
463280	467520	I know I'm an old man. In fact, I just did a video on being an old man,
467520	474000	but man, do I recall and on some level miss the times when people were saying,
474000	477600	don't post your real information on the internet. Then someone can find you. Some creep will look
477600	481840	you up. Don't post your phone number. Don't post your address. Don't post your real name.
481840	486000	I would love to go back to those times. I would love to go back to the times of anonymous accounts
486000	492000	on IRC or something. This is not good for Parler, but it's still on par with everything else. I'd
492000	498400	say it's even on Parler. And here's Parler's terms of service. Parler may remove any content
498400	503840	and terminate access to services at any time for any reason or no reason. Although Parler
503840	509200	endeavors to allow all free speech that is lawful and does not infringe the legal rights of others.
509760	515360	Any invitation made by Parler to you to use the services or submit content to the services,
515360	520160	or the fact that Parler may receive a benefit from your use of the services or provision of
520160	526080	content to the services will not obligate Parler to maintain any content or maintain your access
526080	531200	to the services. Parler will have no liability to you for removing any content for terminating your
531200	536160	access to the services or for modifying or terminating the services at any time and in any
536160	541440	way and for any reason or no reason. Although the Parler guidelines provide guidance to you regarding
541440	546000	content that is not appropriate, Parler is free to remove content and terminate your access to the
546000	551200	services even where the guidelines have been followed. Now this actually sounds quite bad,
551200	555120	and on some level it is quite bad, but there's a few spots where I kind of get it.
556080	560320	For example, when you read the part where it says Parler is not obligated to maintain your
560320	565120	access to the services, that makes sense. Because if you lose your internet package or something,
565120	569520	Parler is not responsible for getting you back on Parler. This basically reads like
569520	575360	you are using Parler's property at their whim. And that does sound really bad, but as long as
575360	581120	their whim is free speech, then you basically just have to trust them. Like it's kind of bad,
581120	586000	but there's no other way they'd word this without putting themselves in some kind of legal loophole
586000	590880	where if they wanted to like close down the site one day they wouldn't be able to do so, you know?
590880	595440	I think that I think this is like standard legalese. That sucks, don't get me wrong,
595440	600080	it's not good, but it's also par for the course, and no I won't make the pun again.
600080	603840	The terms of this user agreement may be modified by Parler in any way and at any time without
603840	607840	notice to you, and you agree to be responsible for making yourself aware of any modification
607840	611760	of the terms and to be bound by any modification of the terms when you continue to access or use
611760	616320	the services after any such modification. This is, again, a spot where Twitter had them beat,
616320	621360	because when Twitter started updating its hate speech policy, it refused to alter really old
621360	626480	tweets, like stuff from 2012 or whatever, I think it was 2017 or 2015 or something along those
626480	631520	lines, when the new policy came into effect, all the tweets from before that era would not be
631520	636080	affected. Unlike on YouTube, where 10 year old videos are getting struck down constantly for
636080	640320	violating the terms of service or the community guidelines or whatever the fuck it is, videos
640320	645600	that are in no way relevant and were completely in line with the terms back then. If you permit us to
645600	650240	access the address book on your device or give us permission to import your contacts from an email
650240	655120	account associated with your account, we may access and store names and contact information
655120	659200	from your address book to facilitate invitations and social interactions that you initiate through
659200	663920	our services and for other purposes described in this privacy policy or at the time of consent of
663920	669120	collection. I mean this one seems easy, don't give them access to that shit. Unless, for some dumb
669120	674080	fuck reason, Parler requires access to your contacts list just to use it, that would be
674080	678720	ridiculous, but I'm on Parler, I haven't been asked anything like that. You can delete your
678720	685520	account by emailing us your request at account.deletion at parler.com. You can't just delete it
685520	691120	in the account settings, you have to email them. I mean that's kind of lame, but fine. You agree to
691120	695440	receive communications from Parler, including communication sent by phone, email, text message,
695440	699760	other means of communication. If you provided a phone number to Parler, you are required to notify
699760	703040	Parler when you cease to own or control that number to help prevent Parler from sending
703040	707520	communications to others who may acquire that number. Alright, so you are forced to accept their
707520	713360	spam. That sucks, but it's just kind of annoying, you know. You agree to arbitrate any dispute that
713360	718960	you have with Parler. You agree to resolve all disputes with Parler through binding arbitration
718960	723920	with the American Arbitration Association in Clark County, Nevada, unless the dispute meets
723920	728960	the requirements for small claims court and is filed in Justice Court Henderson, Clark County,
728960	735440	Nevada. If for any reason this agreement to arbitrate is determined by a court or arbitrator
735440	740160	to be unenforceable, you agree that the federal and state courts with jurisdiction over Clark
740160	746240	County, Nevada will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute involving you and Parler.
746240	752080	Any arbitration will be governed by the AAA commercial arbitration rules, consumer due process
752080	756560	protocol, and supplementary procedures for resolution of consumer-related disputes.
756560	761600	The arbitration will be conducted only by telephone, online, or based solely on written
761600	766160	submissions and not by personal appearance of any party or witness. This user agreement
766160	770880	and any dispute between you and Parler will be governed by the laws of the state of Nevada,
770880	776880	excluding any applicable choice of law provision. Up until this point, things have seemed lame but
776880	782240	normal for a social media site like Parler. I don't know if Twitter or Facebook or anybody else has
782240	788800	a clause like this, but this is absolutely ridiculous. This means simply by using Parler,
788800	794480	if you ever have reason to sue Parler, any reason at all, you can't. You have to arbitrate with
794480	799440	them. You cannot join a class action lawsuit. You cannot file a claim against them. You can only
799440	805360	arbitrate. Now, I've seen similar clauses like this in the past, and they almost always get
805360	811840	thrown out as unenforceable. And I'm pretty sure that this clause here, where if it turns out this
811840	816080	whole thing is unenforceable, you have to agree to their jurisdiction. I don't know if that's
816080	822640	enforceable either. Who knows? But the point is, this is basically them trying to do as much of a
822640	826720	power grab as they can, saying that, oh, if you use our service, you can't sue us. Even if we
826720	830880	fuck you, you can't sue us. And even though this type of thing hasn't rendered unenforceable,
830880	834000	it is going to scare a lot of people away. People who might actually have a legitimate
834000	836800	grievance against Parler, maybe because they just don't know any better, or they don't want
836800	841600	to go through the extra step of trying to overcome this before even filing their case, you know?
841600	846160	Do not purposefully share rumors about other users and people you know are false. Well,
846160	850240	that might be kind of hard. What if you actually think that it's true, and then it turns out you
850240	854960	were wrong? What if you change your mind? What if Parler thinks you're lying? Avoid targeting
854960	859760	red or no-badged users with disparaging information. They are more protected under
859760	865040	the law than prominent individuals. More protected under the law? Is it because users with certain
865040	869600	badges are like public figures or something? I mean, the whole point of social media, one of
869600	875360	the big boons and big drawbacks of social media, is that the minute that you post on social media,
875360	879120	you also become a public figure. It doesn't matter if you have five followers, you're still posting
879120	884320	something publicly. Pornography is considered indecent according to clauses defined by the FCC.
884320	889600	Do not use language or visuals that describe or show sexual organs or activity. Do not use
889600	894480	language or visuals that are morbid or degrading. Avoid language or visuals that are sexual in
894480	899920	nature. So Parler has already gone the way of Gab, where Gab just wanted to straight up ban porn.
899920	906080	You agree to defend and indemnify Parler as well as any of its officers, directors, employees,
906080	913840	and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities,
913840	920480	costs or debt, and expenses, including but not limited to all attorney's fees arising from or
920480	925520	relating to your access and use of the services. Parler will have the right to conduct its own
925520	930800	defense at your expense in any action or proceeding covered by this indemnity.
930800	935680	So if you post something on Parler and Parler gets in trouble for it, you're footing their bill.
935680	940320	This is basically an inverse of the Section 230 Safe Harbor laws that allowed the modern internet
940320	945520	to come to be in the first place. It's kind of crazy. And although it sounds strange,
946160	951520	this is something that other social media companies have actually moved on from.
951520	957680	For example, here's Friendster's indemnity clause from back in 2003. Yeah, remember Friendster?
957680	962560	There's a social media site that went nowhere. But pause this and see if it looks familiar to you.
962560	969840	Here is Facebook's indemnity clause from 2009. Here's MySpace's indemnity clause from 2006.
970640	975840	All of these clauses were put into these websites and eventually dropped. I know Friendster doesn't
975840	980400	exist anymore, but the clause was dropped several years before Friendster went into business.
980400	985680	Facebook and MySpace both dropped theirs years ago as well. It could be the case that with Section
985680	990560	230 protections in place, all of these companies felt that these clauses were no longer valid,
990560	995840	or at least not needed. And maybe Parler is expecting Section 230 to go away, which
995840	1000560	unfortunately is on the table right now because social media companies are behaving
1000560	1006080	so awfully when it comes to political censorship and being unbiased. That some people, rather than
1006080	1011840	reform the system, want the nuclear option of removing Section 230, which will basically kill
1011840	1016880	Google, kill Amazon, kill Facebook, kill Twitter, kill Reddit, kill them all. They'll all be gone.
1016880	1021680	Because it will make them liable to millions of lawsuits. And maybe Parler sees that coming and
1021760	1026480	wants to push that cost off onto its users. Maybe Parler is simply covering its bases,
1026480	1030880	throwing out stuff that it knows won't stick. Maybe Parler is just being a dick. Who knows?
1030880	1034320	Also, I don't know why Parler would ever have your social security number, but
1034320	1039520	a clause like this never looks good. And for all the things that Parler demands of its audience,
1039520	1046160	it's not even truly free speech. Conservatives are flocking to a new free speech social media app
1046160	1051360	that has started banning liberal users. This is just as bad, just going the other way.
1051360	1057280	We do not need an aisle flipped version of Twitter. We need a place where everyone can talk
1057280	1061760	and everyone can debate and everyone can put their heads together and come up with solutions
1061760	1066880	to the problems that we're facing. Hello, Sheriff Joe. Your post is in violation of our terms of
1066880	1074640	service. I'm Marco Rubio. Anyone know where I can find some breast milk? My wife left me. This is in
1074640	1079600	violation of obscenity. This violation has added four to your total points accumulated.
1079600	1085920	Total current violation points is four. As a red or gold badge user, if your account accumulates
1085920	1091040	20 points in a three month period, your account will be banned from Parler and all future
1091040	1097440	services. Now that little Marco Rubio bit sounds a lot like parody to me, but because Parler thinks
1097440	1102320	it's obscene, Sheriff Joe is banned. It turns out that Sheriff Joe actually is banned. It's not just
1102320	1106800	four points on his card or whatever. Yeah, he's gone now. Probably for the sin of posting this
1106800	1112080	publicly and humiliating Parler. But the point is, when the right whines about obscenity, it's
1112080	1118480	the exact same thing as the left whining about problematic. We don't need any of that BS coming
1118480	1124640	from anyone. Pretty much all of my leftist friends joined Parler to screw with MAGA folks, and every
1124640	1129280	last one of them was banned in less than 24 hours because conservatives truly love free speech.
1129280	1133920	They said stuff like, Dan Bongingo, you should really wash your doo-doo ass. One got banned for
1134000	1139120	saying she wants to fight a police dog. Like, what the hell, man? This is no better. This is no
1139120	1145600	fucking better. At this point, when it comes to social media, I'm adopting my own personal terms
1145600	1152240	of service. I call it fuck it. And basically, here's what you do. You sign up for a social
1152240	1158160	media account and you do whatever the fuck you want. And then when they inevitably ban you,
1158160	1162880	because somebody, whether it's left, right, doesn't matter, somebody gets a stick up their ass about
1162880	1168240	it, you make another one because it's free. Emails are free nowadays, social media accounts are free
1168240	1172080	nowadays, it doesn't really matter. If you need a phone number, there's websites you can go where
1172080	1176240	you can sign up and just get like a burner number that lasts 30 minutes, just enough to verify your
1176240	1180800	account, then you get rid of the number. Same with emails, same with IPs, doesn't matter anymore.
1180800	1185040	There was once a point where I was willing to actually listen to the terms of service of all
1185040	1189680	of these companies, but these terms have become so oppressive that the only thing I can think of now
1189680	1196320	is civil disobedience. So no, I will use these sites as much or as little as I want. I will not
1196320	1200800	follow their rules and if I ever want to come back, I will make a new account and come back.
1200800	1206160	And until they actually implement rules that are worth following and do not censor for any reason
1206160	1211680	the users of their site, then I see no reason to abide by them. I am willing to come to the table,
1211680	1216000	I am willing to bend a little bit, I am willing to follow rules that I think are reasonable,
1216000	1219760	but if this is what social media is going to be, then fuck it, I'll do what I want.
1222320	1227520	Hey pals, this is a quick end of video PSA. The talk on Parler's over now, so if you actually
1227520	1230720	want to click away, go ahead. But I do have something else important that I want to talk
1230720	1236640	about and it is related to, you know, stuff going missing online. So I've been somebody who
1237200	1241680	follows a lot of YouTubers that have disappeared. Like for example, I'm on the Cinema Snobs website
1241680	1247680	right now. If you were to try to go back say 10 years and watch the old, old, old Cinema Snobs,
1247680	1251600	a lot of them are gone. A lot of the links on this site are dead because they were on BlipTV
1251600	1257200	and BlipTV's gone. Like for example, here's his review on Caligula from 2010. There's no review
1257200	1262000	here though. A lot of his old stuff is just gone, lost the time. You go to Spoonie's channel if you
1262000	1265680	ever wanted to go back and see his old videos because he's not really doing anything anymore.
1266240	1270160	And like if you scroll down, you'll notice after you get through all the streams,
1270960	1276960	a lot of his stuff is also gone. A lot of the videos, a lot of the vlogs and the reviews,
1276960	1281360	they've simply vanished. And in fact, if you want to watch Spoonie now, you have to go to channels
1281360	1287520	like NotRub here who posts a lot of vlogs that again were only on BlipTV and have largely been
1287520	1293520	lost as well. But he posted them here. There's a lot of old convention footage that was lost.
1293520	1298240	There's a lot of commentary tracks that were lost. Basically stuff that frankly I never thought I'd
1298240	1304240	be able to see again. My point is, I'm going on this wild tangent here. My point is that I never
1304240	1311440	liked the idea of my own content ever being lost to time. For example, as autistic as this is,
1311440	1316560	I have a hard drive where every single playthrough we've ever done over the course of the past seven
1316560	1322880	years on Game Boomers, it's all here, every single playthrough. And it's also all uploaded to the
1322880	1328720	Game Boomers YouTube channel. So whenever we stream on Twitch, I upload that stream as
1328720	1333840	basically as like a let's play on that channel. I've got all the old anime reviews from way back
1333840	1341200	in the day. There's season one of the SFO anime review, season two, and season three, they're all
1341200	1348000	here. And of course, I've also got the Dumping with Scrumps. They're all here. There's a shit
1348000	1352560	ton of Dumping with Scrumps now. I've got all the dev perspectives backed up. All the 10 minute
1352560	1358240	takes are here. Even the really old ones from like four years ago. Point is, I save a lot of this
1358240	1364080	stuff. And I do it because I don't like the idea of my content going missing one day. Everything
1364080	1369680	that I have here is uploaded somewhere. If YouTube won't take it because it's like a hentai review
1369680	1374400	from nine or 10 years ago, it's up on my bit shoot. I have this stuff uploaded somewhere,
1374400	1380320	whether it's on SFO, on Game Boomers, on the dev kit, it exists somewhere. And I have copies
1380320	1382800	of everything that we've ever done. So if something goes missing, or there's a new or
1382800	1387600	there's a new platform, I'll re upload the entire backlog there too. The point is I have liked so
1387600	1393440	many YouTubers whose stuff has gone missing, that I never wanted that to be a problem for me.
1393440	1397440	Whether or not I make it big, if I have any fans at all who want to see my old stuff,
1397440	1401920	I want it to be there. I want it to be available so that somebody can spend a lazy Saturday
1401920	1406240	afternoon watching old YouTube videos from 10 years ago that they're kind of being half
1406240	1410320	nostalgic about. Maybe they just discovered it, whatever. I want that stuff to be available.
1410320	1414880	That is important to me, even though it sounds kind of autistic. And then I had kind of a problem
1415440	1421520	because as you can see, this is a playlist on my Game Boomers YouTube from the Goof Troop
1421520	1427200	playthrough that I did with BLG, Born Losers Gaming. All the videos are privated, except
1427760	1433040	I was smart enough to save them and I re uploaded them to my channel. So here they are in the
1433040	1437200	playlist. If you just scroll down a little bit, I did not exactly want to reveal this,
1437200	1443360	but the preservation of my content, I personally find to be a higher order value than the whole
1443360	1448080	cancel culture thing. But basically when I was talking about people who had thrown me out of
1448080	1452960	their discord in the cancel culture video last week, it was these guys and they are a reasonably
1452960	1457840	small let's play channel. And back when I was a reasonably small let's play channel,
1457840	1462160	we had done crossovers in like 2015 or something, and they decided to delete the crossovers,
1463120	1466320	but I saved them and they're here and they're available for you to watch.
1467200	1474320	Now it would be a personal favor to me if you manage to get more than 400 hits on this part one,
1475920	1480000	because that is all they managed to get on their channel. And that, but that's just a little petty
1480000	1483440	goal for me. It doesn't actually mean anything if you don't, if you don't click on it. And if
1483440	1488640	you do want to give it a click, the playlist will be in the description of, of, uh, of this video.
1488640	1492400	But that's not really my point. My point is, is that I don't like my stuff going missing.
1492400	1497200	Um, there isn't, there's another play through that we did that was, um, only one episode that
1497200	1502320	I have lost unfortunately, and I'm not happy about it. It was an episode of golf with your friends
1502320	1506560	that's gone. Um, but it frankly, it wasn't very good. The goof shoot play through is actually
1506560	1511280	not bad. And we also recorded several things that never came out because the guys over at BLG just
1511280	1514960	didn't want to edit them. There was a secret of mana play through, and there was some Mario Kart
1514960	1519280	eight stuff that they, they never edited. I never got the footage from them. And it's,
1519280	1522000	it's probably never going to come out now because those guys hate me because they've all gone
1522800	1527600	radical left, you know, off the cliff. But yeah, some people actually messaged me and asked, Hey,
1527600	1533840	how come, uh, all these random episodes that are not in your usual game Boomer style are coming
1533840	1537520	out on your channel? Well, this is why, and if you feel like doing me a favor, you know,
1537520	1540880	give that part one, a click, maybe, maybe you'll like the video. Who knows? Anyway,
1540880	1546560	I'm going to get out of here. The Chaz video will come soon. TM. Oh, and I'll see you on my Twitch
1546560	1549600	stream tonight. If you want, we're going to play some final fantasy seven. Anyway,
1549600	1552800	thanks for indulging me. I'll talk to you later. I love you.
