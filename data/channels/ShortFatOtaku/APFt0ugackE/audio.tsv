0	18960	This video acts as both an in-depth look at The Escapist, and also a partial reply to
18960	23280	some of the topics Sargon of Akkad brought up during his own Escapist video.
23280	26200	For those of you who haven't seen Sargon's video, I recommend you go take a look.
26200	27200	It's great stuff.
27200	31160	However, let me quickly recap The Escapist's involvement in Gamergate up until now.
31160	34560	The Escapist was one of the only websites that refused to censor discussion of the Zoe
34560	39440	post back in August 2014, despite what we would later learn to be large amounts of pressure
39440	44200	on Greg Tito, The Escapist's editor-in-chief, to do so, pressure that originated from Ben
44200	48560	Kucera and other members of the Cabal that made up the Game General Pro's mailing list.
48560	52860	The Escapist very quickly updated its ethics policy in response to Gamergate.
52860	56840	Alexander Makris published on The Escapist a rebuttal to the coordinated Gamers are
56840	61040	Dead Attack articles, stating that Gamers are indeed not dead.
61040	66360	Greg Tito himself published a similar article called, Why I Still Call Myself a Gamer.
66360	71540	And with the recent hiring of Brandon Morris and Lizzie F, two very pro-Gamergate individuals,
71540	74960	as well as rumblings of also bringing Oliver Campbell on board, everyone is throwing their
74960	77920	hats in the air and talking about how this is a major victory for Gamergate.
77920	81700	I understand all you guys' enthusiasm, and I don't want to be a wet blanket, but let's
81700	83920	take a step back and look at this with a critical eye.
83920	89280	Yes, it's good that anti-Gamer individuals like Jim Sterling and the notoriously stupid
89280	92200	Movie Bob have been given the boot from The Escapist.
92200	96520	The rhetoric they peddled was ultimately about using misogyny as a tool to cover up unethical
96520	100280	conduct, something that a journalist's site based on ethics should not be endorsing.
100280	101480	But what about Greg Tito?
101480	103280	Greg Tito is a hard guy to read, in my opinion.
103280	107760	I have no doubt he's a good guy, as a lot of people have attested to, but he was let
107760	111940	go from The Escapist as well, and replaced with an editor-in-chief that seems to be very,
111940	116020	very openly pro-gamer, which is what you want to see at the head of a gaming publication.
116020	119760	During the roundtable discussion Tito had with TotalBiscuit, Janelle Bonanno, and Eric
119760	124640	Kanan on October 6th, he seemed to paint himself as being against Gamergate.
124640	129060	Not outwardly or obviously, and certainly not in an inflammatory or harassing manner,
129060	133040	but his tone, his comments regarding other journalists, all pointed toward a person who
133040	134540	didn't support GG.
134540	139340	In a post on Innuendo Studios Tumblr describing why they left The Escapist, he talks about
139340	144060	a phone call with Tito, Alex Macros, whom I mentioned earlier as having published articles
144060	147820	on The Escapist, works for The Escapist's parent company Defy Media.
147820	152080	Essentially, he was Greg Tito's boss, and he was behind publishing the two pieces outlining
152080	154240	various developers' feelings on Gamergate.
154240	158980	Were Tito's superiors at Defy Media pro-Gamergate, and they butted heads with their anti-Gamergate
158980	161620	editor-in-chief enough that they simply decided to let him go?
161620	162620	It's a possibility.
162620	167360	It's also a possibility that Greg Tito's Why I Still Call Myself a Gamer article was
167360	168360	actually heartfelt.
168380	171560	In any case, somebody somewhere was putting the squeeze on Tito.
171560	174400	If he was pro-Gamergate, the cabal was pressuring him.
174400	177660	If he was anti-Gamergate, his bosses were probably pressuring him.
177660	180680	The most likely story is that he was neutral and taking it from everybody.
180680	183080	But is The Escapist pro-Gamergate?
183080	187320	Defy Media pulled the plug on writing about Gamergate after the backlash that the developer
187320	188960	interviews received.
188960	192360	They weren't censoring discussion, but they also weren't reporting on it anymore.
192360	194980	The post on Innuendo Studios Tumblr says it the best.
194980	197900	If you want to talk ethics, let's talk about this.
197900	202620	A news site is forbidden by corporate from covering a major topic in gaming, and both
202620	207100	site and parent company have come away thinking that all controversial content is bad.
207100	212160	And what's really interesting is an article on The Escapist published in 2005 by Jennifer
212160	214660	Buckendorf called Gamer Like Me.
214660	219500	Despite being from nearly ten years before Gamergate, it reads exactly like the Gamers
219500	223940	Are Dead articles, complete with Buckendorf saying, maybe the whole concept of a gamer
223940	226420	is outdated, a remnant from five years ago.
226420	228900	Of course, that was from 2005.
228900	233300	It was the last thing Buckendorf ever published on The Escapist, and after writing similar
233300	238000	SJW-styled pieces for such outlets as Salon, she eventually left journalism to go work
238000	239000	at Amazon.
239000	243420	And the anti-Gamergators, along with Greg Tito, assuming he wasn't an anti himself,
243420	244820	have all been given the boot as well.
244820	246340	Perhaps the issue is time.
246340	250980	The Escapist was once anti-GG, and with policy revisions and shakeups, it's been slowly
250980	252820	swinging pro over the past six months.
252820	256340	However, at this point, there's still a significant possibility that these changes
256340	258380	are political rather than substantive.
258380	263180	To me, this feels like people being pro-GG or anti-GG for the sake of perpetuating their
263180	266840	chosen banner, while not actually caring about what that means.
266840	271940	In short, if Gamergate is about ethics, then staff shakeups at The Escapist shouldn't
271940	273640	necessarily be a cause for celebration.
273640	278340	No offense to Lizzie or Brandon or Oliver or Leanna Kay, but it's not your hiring
278340	282800	that should matter to Gamergate, but rather your performing your jobs in an ethical manner.
282800	285840	And no offense to you, Sargon, but I disagree with you when you say that this is a decisive
285840	286840	victory.
286840	287840	Why?
287840	291080	Because to be pro-Gamergate not only means to support ethical standards, but to adhere
291080	293140	to them yourself if you're a publication.
293140	296000	And in my opinion, The Escapist still has some problems.
296000	298560	Let's go back to Innuendo Studios' Tumblr post.
298560	302440	The news site is forbidden by corporate from covering a major topic is troubling enough.
302440	306340	However, on the phone call, Greg Tito explained that the Gamergate pieces featuring interviews
306340	310940	with developers was pushed through editorial with less oversight than usual, likely on
310940	314140	account of it being written by Alex Makris, Greg Tito's boss.
314140	317640	I don't think that any of us over here at the Short Fight Otaku channel exist in an
317640	318640	echo chamber.
318640	322080	We read stuff we don't agree with, because it's always good to have your ideas challenged.
322080	327180	Which is why I reread the post on Zoe Quinn's blog, Let's Talk About Ethics in Games Journalism.
327180	331200	Yes, Zoe Quinn wrote a blog post about ethics in games journalism.
331200	335800	I have a feeling that nobody in Gamergate noticed it, because they all died from laughter
335800	339180	after seeing the title, however she actually makes some very good points.
339180	343720	There's a section where Zoe decries Gamergate holding up The Escapist as a paragon of integrity,
343720	349180	as she lists off various ethical violations that Gigi is, according to her, ignoring.
349180	350700	Let's take a look at these violations.
350700	354320	On the first iteration of the What Male Game Developers Think of Gamergate article, the
354320	358080	one that Alex Makris pushed through with little editing oversight, there was a quotation from
358080	360240	James Desbereau, a developer.
360240	363680	Editor's note 3 claims that his portion of the article was removed due to claims of harassment.
363680	366740	However, looking at the logs of the Burgers and Fries IRC channel, which is where the
366740	370240	harassment was alleged to have taken place, shows that this isn't the case whatsoever.
370240	374800	At the same time, Alex Makris is a backer to Desbereau's project, something that Desbereau
374800	378040	pointed out on his private blog that The Escapist should have disclosed.
378040	381820	It seems odd to me that Desbereau's quote would be removed from the article under the
381820	383940	pretense of harassment that he never committed.
383940	389320	Zoe also brings up this piece on The Escapist, a 2011 Holiday Buyer's Guide.
389320	390940	Of note is the second recommendation.
390940	394760	Of note is the second recommendation, Adventure Conqueror King System.
394780	399100	A full paragraph describes the game and recommends it to the reader, and the review is quite positive.
399100	404220	Nowhere on this piece is it disclosed that Adventure Conqueror King System was designed
404220	407660	by Alex Makris and Greg Tito.
407660	411060	Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, maybe I'm seeing things that aren't there,
411060	414120	or treading over old ground that's already been resolved at some location that I haven't
414120	415120	been able to find.
415120	419680	All of these examples of unethical conduct over at The Escapist are, in fact, old happenings.
419680	424220	But so were Patricia Hernandez's infractions, and we were entirely willing to call for her
424220	428480	job when we discovered her unethical behaviors, despite them happening years ago.
428480	429840	We can't play favorites.
429840	434460	If it's not okay for Hernandez to do, even several years after the fact, then it also
434460	438020	can't be okay for Makris to do, several years after the fact either.
438020	442040	We can't simply ignore Makris's conduct and hand-wave the ethical infractions because
442040	446160	it happened a few years ago, if we're still so insistent on holding responsible, say,
446160	450440	Ian Miles-Chiang for all the neo-Nazi shit he said back when he was an edgy, try-hard
450440	451580	teenage emo kid.
451580	455980	We can't demand only part of this industry to own up to offenses happened in the past,
455980	459640	while giving the other part a free pass due to it being a little while, all because we
459640	461820	like one group politically more than the other.
461820	464700	Just as a side point, let's quickly check out what Zoe's got to say about ethics in
464700	467160	games journalism beyond just her comments on The Escapist.
467160	470960	A lot of it is blaming Gamergate for various forms of harassment other than actually discussing
470960	473140	ethics and nobody is surprised at that.
473140	477520	It's the same propaganda regurgitated from the depths of her blockbot-enforced echo chamber
477520	479280	that we're all used to hearing at this point.
479460	482980	Zoe links to a storyfi entitled, Gamergate supports Jack Thompson.
482980	483980	Sounds pretty damning, right?
483980	487940	Paige is a collection of pro-GG tweets coming out and saying Jack Thompson is cool, with
487940	489860	the header picture being from a recent interview.
489860	494140	Jay Allen says, Jack Thompson criticized Sarkeesian, so now gamergate loves him.
494140	497100	Yeah, this actually does sound kind of damning.
497100	498100	But let's watch the interview.
509280	537740	So no, I'm not for censorship, I believe in a free society.
537740	541520	That does in fact sound reasonable.
541520	543680	There's one of three possibilities here.
543680	545840	One, Jack Thompson's being duplicitous.
545840	548860	Two, Jack Thompson changed his tune over the years.
548860	552120	Or three, Jack Thompson was misunderstood back in the day.
552120	560440	And yes, Thompson does have something to say about Anita Sarkeesian.
560440	562480	But what is it that made gamergate warm up to him?
562480	566200	A five second clip where he says Anita's not familiar with the importance of free speech
566200	567200	in a civilized society?
567200	571620	Or the longer portion, where he describes his position on games and denounces censorship?
571620	575500	It was probably both, however I'm going to place greater importance on his discussion
575500	579780	of the censorship of our industry, and the clarification of his position, rather than
579780	583080	a tiny pot shot taken at a woman not even involved in gamergate.
583080	586860	At this point the anti-gamers are completely inverting in on themselves.
586860	591280	They slander gamergate with the specter of Jack Thompson, specifically because Jack Thompson
591280	594960	was given an opportunity to say he's not actually interested in censoring games and
594960	595960	we believed him.
595960	601760	While they actually want to censor games by trying to get hatred or honeypop off steam,
601760	607200	getting Target to pull GTA 5 from store shelves, and our good friend Full Macintosh destroying
607200	611160	games and declaring the industry to be depraved, claiming that Smash Brothers causes violence
611160	616480	and conflicts, while his good pal Ben Kucera in the same twitter thread says that Tetris
616480	619160	is soviet propaganda because it has a russian song in it.
619160	624160	After seeing that bout of insanity, I actually have no problem being associated with Jack
624160	625160	Thompson.
625160	627880	He also has a passage on TechRaptor, let's take a peek.
627880	632700	Zoe says that TechRaptor cited an imager link that was so hilariously asinine that Zoe took
632700	634400	it as her new company name.
634400	638160	Well that's great Zoe, but you haven't actually shown why the content of the link
638160	639160	was asinine.
639160	643360	You're offering no refutation, you're simply trying to discredit it through mockery.
643360	648740	Zoe says that TechRaptor used a reddit comment as a single source to publish serious accusations
648740	649740	of sabotage.
649740	652800	Here she's referring to the fine young capitalist posts on reddit, describing how
652800	656440	their game jam was blacklisted from being reported on due to Zoe's influence.
656440	660640	Meanwhile the article she links talks about many different topics, none of which Zoe comments
660640	661760	on but the one.
661760	666040	Zoe, you're right in that they used a single source from reddit, but the source checked
666040	670320	out and you're, again, not proving any evidence to the contrary.
670320	674880	Zoe says that TechRaptor publishes articles riddled with basic syntax and grammar errors.
674880	676440	Looking at her example, she's right.
676440	679760	Zoe posts an image showing that the people at TechRaptor don't know what the concept
679760	681280	of death of the author means.
681280	682440	Again, she's right.
682480	686240	Zoe links to TechRaptor's ethics policy and says it's missing some parts of the
686240	690600	code of ethics on the Society of Professional Journalists website, as well as sounding more
690600	692840	like a list of gamergate talking points.
692840	694900	Again, she's right.
694900	699140	But neither the ethics pages nor the real world behaviours of the publications gamergate
699140	701280	is boycotting line up with this code either.
701280	705520	Zoe goes on to complain that Georgina Young corrected articles she made mistakes on as
705520	706880	new facts came to light.
706880	709960	Does anybody need to have it explained to them why this is ridiculous?
710040	712720	The reasons and clarifications and disclosures are what we want.
712720	716280	It's always unfortunate when new information comes out that renders an article obsolete.
716280	720840	However, it crosses the line from unfortunate to unethical when the publication simply marches
720840	723720	on and refuses to publicly discuss their mistake.
723720	725080	TechRaptor doesn't do that.
725080	726860	Zoe, your chosen sites do.
726860	731440	She claims a retweet of an advertisement from Stardock's Twitter, by TechRaptor's Twitter,
731440	732780	is a conflict of interest.
732780	737080	When I am only able to find TechRaptor's interviewing Stardock CEO Brad Wardell, and
737080	741520	certainly no TechRaptor hosted reviews of his games, she claims TechRaptor accepting
741520	745600	donations from prominent gamergaters is a conflict of interest since TechRaptor writes
745600	746600	about gamergate.
746600	751160	That would make sense if gamergate were a strictly defined organization that had a unified
751160	752560	financial interest.
752560	756200	And no offense to Boink, but I've never heard of him before, I'm not sure if he qualifies
756200	757200	as prominent.
757200	761360	In the end, after looking at what Zoe's got to say about TechRaptor, do I think they're
761360	762360	unethical?
762360	763360	No.
763360	768060	The problems Zoe's outline regarding TechRaptor that I agree with stem from, and no offense
768060	770760	to them, a general incompetence.
770760	775040	Things like lack of knowledge or grammar and syntax errors are signs that TechRaptor is
775040	779680	experiencing growing pains and needs to up its technical game, not signs that it's an
779680	781600	unethical tabloid rag.
781600	786400	And the good news is, the problems that TechRaptor have are solved by practice and time.
786400	788400	Ethics problems run far deeper.
788400	792160	Zoe concludes by bringing up new ethical problems gamergate has actually created.
792160	795720	She brings up campaigns of misinformation and astroturfing when that is exactly what
795720	799700	she and her compatriots in the cabal have employed as their go-to tactics since long
799700	800920	before gamergate existed.
800920	804960	She points at the low score of Depression Quest as an example of vote brigading while
804960	809880	not even recognizing the very likely possibility that her game is just shit and people are
809880	810880	voting accordingly.
810880	814840	She says that we need to support games writers that aren't strictly journalists, but also
814840	818520	opinion writers, critics, academics and developers.
818520	823760	And I wholeheartedly agree, while adding the caveat that not just their opinion writers,
823760	828720	their critics, their academics or their developers need to be heard, but also people who speak
828720	830240	for the rest of us as well.
830240	834540	She says that we need to discuss standards and ethical expectations of YouTubers in relation
834540	836940	to their coverage of games, and again I agree.
836940	839880	She says that we need to make sure that the press we work with are not just fronts by
839880	843460	political radicals pushing an agenda, but while she says that hyper conservatives are
843460	848220	guilty of this, I would also add that her hyper liberal supporters are equally guilty
848220	857740	of pushing an agenda.
857740	863980	In the end, Zoe outlined a list of very real concerns, and in doing so, accurately described
863980	865800	the behavior of her and her friends.
865800	868860	So really, Zoe was actually right, at least some of the time.
868860	872940	TechRaptor really is the place to be going forward, but in my opinion it needs to refine
872940	875120	its craft now that it's in the spotlight.
875120	878700	The Escapist, meanwhile, certainly seems to be better ethically than the other big
878700	879700	name publications.
879700	883500	However, when there's a slip up, the same two people seem to be involved, either Greg
883500	885940	Tito or Alex Makris.
885940	887860	And Greg's gone, but Alex isn't.
887860	891340	Congratulations to everybody who's currently joining The Escapist, and congratulations
891340	893140	to TechRaptor for your newfound success.
893140	896580	We've got high hopes for all of you, we all know you'll do a great job, and I hope
896580	900020	I didn't offend any of you, or you either, Sargon, for that matter.
900020	904300	But, and this should go without saying, we do expect ethical conduct out of you, and
904300	907500	I hope you don't think that being pro-Gamergate means you're above that.
907500	911740	And Alex Makris, maybe you've seen your previous errors and decided to change.
911740	915500	Maybe you're behind The Escapist's recent improvements that everyone loves so much.
915500	919260	And I hope you have gotten better, and I hope your site continues to thrive.
919260	923820	But in my opinion, Gamergate should keep a close eye on The Escapist and Makris' conduct
923820	924820	going forward.
