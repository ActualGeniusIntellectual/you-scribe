1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,960
This video acts as both an in-depth look at The Escapist, and also a partial reply to

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,280
some of the topics Sargon of Akkad brought up during his own Escapist video.

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,200
For those of you who haven't seen Sargon's video, I recommend you go take a look.

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,200
It's great stuff.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,160
However, let me quickly recap The Escapist's involvement in Gamergate up until now.

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,560
The Escapist was one of the only websites that refused to censor discussion of the Zoe

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,440
post back in August 2014, despite what we would later learn to be large amounts of pressure

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,200
on Greg Tito, The Escapist's editor-in-chief, to do so, pressure that originated from Ben

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,560
Kucera and other members of the Cabal that made up the Game General Pro's mailing list.

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,860
The Escapist very quickly updated its ethics policy in response to Gamergate.

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,840
Alexander Makris published on The Escapist a rebuttal to the coordinated Gamers are

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,040
Dead Attack articles, stating that Gamers are indeed not dead.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,360
Greg Tito himself published a similar article called, Why I Still Call Myself a Gamer.

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,540
And with the recent hiring of Brandon Morris and Lizzie F, two very pro-Gamergate individuals,

15
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,960
as well as rumblings of also bringing Oliver Campbell on board, everyone is throwing their

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,920
hats in the air and talking about how this is a major victory for Gamergate.

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,700
I understand all you guys' enthusiasm, and I don't want to be a wet blanket, but let's

18
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,920
take a step back and look at this with a critical eye.

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,280
Yes, it's good that anti-Gamer individuals like Jim Sterling and the notoriously stupid

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,200
Movie Bob have been given the boot from The Escapist.

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,520
The rhetoric they peddled was ultimately about using misogyny as a tool to cover up unethical

22
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,280
conduct, something that a journalist's site based on ethics should not be endorsing.

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,480
But what about Greg Tito?

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,280
Greg Tito is a hard guy to read, in my opinion.

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,760
I have no doubt he's a good guy, as a lot of people have attested to, but he was let

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,940
go from The Escapist as well, and replaced with an editor-in-chief that seems to be very,

27
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,020
very openly pro-gamer, which is what you want to see at the head of a gaming publication.

28
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,760
During the roundtable discussion Tito had with TotalBiscuit, Janelle Bonanno, and Eric

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,640
Kanan on October 6th, he seemed to paint himself as being against Gamergate.

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,060
Not outwardly or obviously, and certainly not in an inflammatory or harassing manner,

31
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,040
but his tone, his comments regarding other journalists, all pointed toward a person who

32
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,540
didn't support GG.

33
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,340
In a post on Innuendo Studios Tumblr describing why they left The Escapist, he talks about

34
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,060
a phone call with Tito, Alex Macros, whom I mentioned earlier as having published articles

35
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,820
on The Escapist, works for The Escapist's parent company Defy Media.

36
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,080
Essentially, he was Greg Tito's boss, and he was behind publishing the two pieces outlining

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,240
various developers' feelings on Gamergate.

38
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,980
Were Tito's superiors at Defy Media pro-Gamergate, and they butted heads with their anti-Gamergate

39
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,620
editor-in-chief enough that they simply decided to let him go?

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,620
It's a possibility.

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,360
It's also a possibility that Greg Tito's Why I Still Call Myself a Gamer article was

42
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
actually heartfelt.

43
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,560
In any case, somebody somewhere was putting the squeeze on Tito.

44
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,400
If he was pro-Gamergate, the cabal was pressuring him.

45
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,660
If he was anti-Gamergate, his bosses were probably pressuring him.

46
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,680
The most likely story is that he was neutral and taking it from everybody.

47
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,080
But is The Escapist pro-Gamergate?

48
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,320
Defy Media pulled the plug on writing about Gamergate after the backlash that the developer

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,960
interviews received.

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,360
They weren't censoring discussion, but they also weren't reporting on it anymore.

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,980
The post on Innuendo Studios Tumblr says it the best.

52
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,900
If you want to talk ethics, let's talk about this.

53
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,620
A news site is forbidden by corporate from covering a major topic in gaming, and both

54
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,100
site and parent company have come away thinking that all controversial content is bad.

55
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,160
And what's really interesting is an article on The Escapist published in 2005 by Jennifer

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,660
Buckendorf called Gamer Like Me.

57
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,500
Despite being from nearly ten years before Gamergate, it reads exactly like the Gamers

58
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,940
Are Dead articles, complete with Buckendorf saying, maybe the whole concept of a gamer

59
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,420
is outdated, a remnant from five years ago.

60
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,900
Of course, that was from 2005.

61
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,300
It was the last thing Buckendorf ever published on The Escapist, and after writing similar

62
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,000
SJW-styled pieces for such outlets as Salon, she eventually left journalism to go work

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
at Amazon.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,420
And the anti-Gamergators, along with Greg Tito, assuming he wasn't an anti himself,

65
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,820
have all been given the boot as well.

66
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,340
Perhaps the issue is time.

67
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,980
The Escapist was once anti-GG, and with policy revisions and shakeups, it's been slowly

68
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,820
swinging pro over the past six months.

69
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,340
However, at this point, there's still a significant possibility that these changes

70
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,380
are political rather than substantive.

71
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,180
To me, this feels like people being pro-GG or anti-GG for the sake of perpetuating their

72
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,840
chosen banner, while not actually caring about what that means.

73
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,940
In short, if Gamergate is about ethics, then staff shakeups at The Escapist shouldn't

74
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,640
necessarily be a cause for celebration.

75
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,340
No offense to Lizzie or Brandon or Oliver or Leanna Kay, but it's not your hiring

76
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,800
that should matter to Gamergate, but rather your performing your jobs in an ethical manner.

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,840
And no offense to you, Sargon, but I disagree with you when you say that this is a decisive

78
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
victory.

79
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Why?

80
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,080
Because to be pro-Gamergate not only means to support ethical standards, but to adhere

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,140
to them yourself if you're a publication.

82
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,000
And in my opinion, The Escapist still has some problems.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,560
Let's go back to Innuendo Studios' Tumblr post.

84
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,440
The news site is forbidden by corporate from covering a major topic is troubling enough.

85
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,340
However, on the phone call, Greg Tito explained that the Gamergate pieces featuring interviews

86
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,940
with developers was pushed through editorial with less oversight than usual, likely on

87
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,140
account of it being written by Alex Makris, Greg Tito's boss.

88
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,640
I don't think that any of us over here at the Short Fight Otaku channel exist in an

89
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
echo chamber.

90
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,080
We read stuff we don't agree with, because it's always good to have your ideas challenged.

91
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,180
Which is why I reread the post on Zoe Quinn's blog, Let's Talk About Ethics in Games Journalism.

92
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,200
Yes, Zoe Quinn wrote a blog post about ethics in games journalism.

93
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,800
I have a feeling that nobody in Gamergate noticed it, because they all died from laughter

94
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,180
after seeing the title, however she actually makes some very good points.

95
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,720
There's a section where Zoe decries Gamergate holding up The Escapist as a paragon of integrity,

96
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,180
as she lists off various ethical violations that Gigi is, according to her, ignoring.

97
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,700
Let's take a look at these violations.

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,320
On the first iteration of the What Male Game Developers Think of Gamergate article, the

99
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,080
one that Alex Makris pushed through with little editing oversight, there was a quotation from

100
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,240
James Desbereau, a developer.

101
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,680
Editor's note 3 claims that his portion of the article was removed due to claims of harassment.

102
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,740
However, looking at the logs of the Burgers and Fries IRC channel, which is where the

103
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,240
harassment was alleged to have taken place, shows that this isn't the case whatsoever.

104
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,800
At the same time, Alex Makris is a backer to Desbereau's project, something that Desbereau

105
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,040
pointed out on his private blog that The Escapist should have disclosed.

106
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,820
It seems odd to me that Desbereau's quote would be removed from the article under the

107
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,940
pretense of harassment that he never committed.

108
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,320
Zoe also brings up this piece on The Escapist, a 2011 Holiday Buyer's Guide.

109
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,940
Of note is the second recommendation.

110
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,760
Of note is the second recommendation, Adventure Conqueror King System.

111
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,100
A full paragraph describes the game and recommends it to the reader, and the review is quite positive.

112
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,220
Nowhere on this piece is it disclosed that Adventure Conqueror King System was designed

113
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,660
by Alex Makris and Greg Tito.

114
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,060
Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, maybe I'm seeing things that aren't there,

115
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,120
or treading over old ground that's already been resolved at some location that I haven't

116
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
been able to find.

117
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,680
All of these examples of unethical conduct over at The Escapist are, in fact, old happenings.

118
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,220
But so were Patricia Hernandez's infractions, and we were entirely willing to call for her

119
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,480
job when we discovered her unethical behaviors, despite them happening years ago.

120
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,840
We can't play favorites.

121
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,460
If it's not okay for Hernandez to do, even several years after the fact, then it also

122
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,020
can't be okay for Makris to do, several years after the fact either.

123
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,040
We can't simply ignore Makris's conduct and hand-wave the ethical infractions because

124
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,160
it happened a few years ago, if we're still so insistent on holding responsible, say,

125
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,440
Ian Miles-Chiang for all the neo-Nazi shit he said back when he was an edgy, try-hard

126
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,580
teenage emo kid.

127
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,980
We can't demand only part of this industry to own up to offenses happened in the past,

128
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,640
while giving the other part a free pass due to it being a little while, all because we

129
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,820
like one group politically more than the other.

130
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,700
Just as a side point, let's quickly check out what Zoe's got to say about ethics in

131
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,160
games journalism beyond just her comments on The Escapist.

132
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,960
A lot of it is blaming Gamergate for various forms of harassment other than actually discussing

133
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,140
ethics and nobody is surprised at that.

134
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,520
It's the same propaganda regurgitated from the depths of her blockbot-enforced echo chamber

135
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,280
that we're all used to hearing at this point.

136
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,980
Zoe links to a storyfi entitled, Gamergate supports Jack Thompson.

137
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
Sounds pretty damning, right?

138
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,940
Paige is a collection of pro-GG tweets coming out and saying Jack Thompson is cool, with

139
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,860
the header picture being from a recent interview.

140
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:14,140
Jay Allen says, Jack Thompson criticized Sarkeesian, so now gamergate loves him.

141
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,100
Yeah, this actually does sound kind of damning.

142
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
But let's watch the interview.

143
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:57,740
So no, I'm not for censorship, I believe in a free society.

144
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,520
That does in fact sound reasonable.

145
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,680
There's one of three possibilities here.

146
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,840
One, Jack Thompson's being duplicitous.

147
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,860
Two, Jack Thompson changed his tune over the years.

148
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,120
Or three, Jack Thompson was misunderstood back in the day.

149
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:20,440
And yes, Thompson does have something to say about Anita Sarkeesian.

150
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,480
But what is it that made gamergate warm up to him?

151
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,200
A five second clip where he says Anita's not familiar with the importance of free speech

152
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
in a civilized society?

153
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,620
Or the longer portion, where he describes his position on games and denounces censorship?

154
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,500
It was probably both, however I'm going to place greater importance on his discussion

155
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,780
of the censorship of our industry, and the clarification of his position, rather than

156
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,080
a tiny pot shot taken at a woman not even involved in gamergate.

157
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,860
At this point the anti-gamers are completely inverting in on themselves.

158
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,280
They slander gamergate with the specter of Jack Thompson, specifically because Jack Thompson

159
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,960
was given an opportunity to say he's not actually interested in censoring games and

160
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
we believed him.

161
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:01,760
While they actually want to censor games by trying to get hatred or honeypop off steam,

162
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,200
getting Target to pull GTA 5 from store shelves, and our good friend Full Macintosh destroying

163
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,160
games and declaring the industry to be depraved, claiming that Smash Brothers causes violence

164
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,480
and conflicts, while his good pal Ben Kucera in the same twitter thread says that Tetris

165
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,160
is soviet propaganda because it has a russian song in it.

166
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,160
After seeing that bout of insanity, I actually have no problem being associated with Jack

167
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
Thompson.

168
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,880
He also has a passage on TechRaptor, let's take a peek.

169
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,700
Zoe says that TechRaptor cited an imager link that was so hilariously asinine that Zoe took

170
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,400
it as her new company name.

171
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,160
Well that's great Zoe, but you haven't actually shown why the content of the link

172
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
was asinine.

173
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,360
You're offering no refutation, you're simply trying to discredit it through mockery.

174
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,740
Zoe says that TechRaptor used a reddit comment as a single source to publish serious accusations

175
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,740
of sabotage.

176
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,800
Here she's referring to the fine young capitalist posts on reddit, describing how

177
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,440
their game jam was blacklisted from being reported on due to Zoe's influence.

178
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,640
Meanwhile the article she links talks about many different topics, none of which Zoe comments

179
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,760
on but the one.

180
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,040
Zoe, you're right in that they used a single source from reddit, but the source checked

181
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:10,320
out and you're, again, not proving any evidence to the contrary.

182
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,880
Zoe says that TechRaptor publishes articles riddled with basic syntax and grammar errors.

183
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,440
Looking at her example, she's right.

184
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,760
Zoe posts an image showing that the people at TechRaptor don't know what the concept

185
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,280
of death of the author means.

186
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,440
Again, she's right.

187
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,240
Zoe links to TechRaptor's ethics policy and says it's missing some parts of the

188
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,600
code of ethics on the Society of Professional Journalists website, as well as sounding more

189
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,840
like a list of gamergate talking points.

190
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,900
Again, she's right.

191
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,140
But neither the ethics pages nor the real world behaviours of the publications gamergate

192
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,280
is boycotting line up with this code either.

193
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,520
Zoe goes on to complain that Georgina Young corrected articles she made mistakes on as

194
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,880
new facts came to light.

195
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,960
Does anybody need to have it explained to them why this is ridiculous?

196
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,720
The reasons and clarifications and disclosures are what we want.

197
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,280
It's always unfortunate when new information comes out that renders an article obsolete.

198
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,840
However, it crosses the line from unfortunate to unethical when the publication simply marches

199
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,720
on and refuses to publicly discuss their mistake.

200
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,080
TechRaptor doesn't do that.

201
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,860
Zoe, your chosen sites do.

202
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,440
She claims a retweet of an advertisement from Stardock's Twitter, by TechRaptor's Twitter,

203
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,780
is a conflict of interest.

204
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,080
When I am only able to find TechRaptor's interviewing Stardock CEO Brad Wardell, and

205
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,520
certainly no TechRaptor hosted reviews of his games, she claims TechRaptor accepting

206
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,600
donations from prominent gamergaters is a conflict of interest since TechRaptor writes

207
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
about gamergate.

208
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,160
That would make sense if gamergate were a strictly defined organization that had a unified

209
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,560
financial interest.

210
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,200
And no offense to Boink, but I've never heard of him before, I'm not sure if he qualifies

211
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
as prominent.

212
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,360
In the end, after looking at what Zoe's got to say about TechRaptor, do I think they're

213
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
unethical?

214
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
No.

215
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,060
The problems Zoe's outline regarding TechRaptor that I agree with stem from, and no offense

216
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,760
to them, a general incompetence.

217
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,040
Things like lack of knowledge or grammar and syntax errors are signs that TechRaptor is

218
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,680
experiencing growing pains and needs to up its technical game, not signs that it's an

219
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,600
unethical tabloid rag.

220
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,400
And the good news is, the problems that TechRaptor have are solved by practice and time.

221
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Ethics problems run far deeper.

222
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,160
Zoe concludes by bringing up new ethical problems gamergate has actually created.

223
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,720
She brings up campaigns of misinformation and astroturfing when that is exactly what

224
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,700
she and her compatriots in the cabal have employed as their go-to tactics since long

225
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,920
before gamergate existed.

226
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,960
She points at the low score of Depression Quest as an example of vote brigading while

227
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,880
not even recognizing the very likely possibility that her game is just shit and people are

228
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
voting accordingly.

229
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,840
She says that we need to support games writers that aren't strictly journalists, but also

230
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,520
opinion writers, critics, academics and developers.

231
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,760
And I wholeheartedly agree, while adding the caveat that not just their opinion writers,

232
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,720
their critics, their academics or their developers need to be heard, but also people who speak

233
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,240
for the rest of us as well.

234
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,540
She says that we need to discuss standards and ethical expectations of YouTubers in relation

235
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,940
to their coverage of games, and again I agree.

236
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,880
She says that we need to make sure that the press we work with are not just fronts by

237
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,460
political radicals pushing an agenda, but while she says that hyper conservatives are

238
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,220
guilty of this, I would also add that her hyper liberal supporters are equally guilty

239
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:17,740
of pushing an agenda.

240
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,980
In the end, Zoe outlined a list of very real concerns, and in doing so, accurately described

241
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,800
the behavior of her and her friends.

242
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,860
So really, Zoe was actually right, at least some of the time.

243
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,940
TechRaptor really is the place to be going forward, but in my opinion it needs to refine

244
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,120
its craft now that it's in the spotlight.

245
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,700
The Escapist, meanwhile, certainly seems to be better ethically than the other big

246
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,700
name publications.

247
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,500
However, when there's a slip up, the same two people seem to be involved, either Greg

248
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,940
Tito or Alex Makris.

249
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,860
And Greg's gone, but Alex isn't.

250
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,340
Congratulations to everybody who's currently joining The Escapist, and congratulations

251
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,140
to TechRaptor for your newfound success.

252
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,580
We've got high hopes for all of you, we all know you'll do a great job, and I hope

253
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,020
I didn't offend any of you, or you either, Sargon, for that matter.

254
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,300
But, and this should go without saying, we do expect ethical conduct out of you, and

255
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,500
I hope you don't think that being pro-Gamergate means you're above that.

256
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,740
And Alex Makris, maybe you've seen your previous errors and decided to change.

257
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,500
Maybe you're behind The Escapist's recent improvements that everyone loves so much.

258
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,260
And I hope you have gotten better, and I hope your site continues to thrive.

259
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,820
But in my opinion, Gamergate should keep a close eye on The Escapist and Makris' conduct

260
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,820
going forward.

261
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,260
And based on some of his past decisions, I don't think that's an unreasonable course

262
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,220
of action.

263
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,340
So everybody knows that The Escapist wouldn't even be a thing of room for Yahtzee, anyway.
