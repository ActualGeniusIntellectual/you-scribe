0	3580	Sup guys, this is just a short update video letting you all know what's going on.
3580	6560	Our channel is going on a short hiatus until June 1st.
6560	10360	The truth of it is, we've had a run of disasters that have made working on the channel next
10360	11360	to impossible.
11360	14680	The main reason we've been putting out as many Rogue Legacy videos as we have over the
14680	18640	past couple weeks is because we've been having computer problems and the Rogue Legacy stuff
18640	22340	was the only thing ready to go before our editing PC started acting up.
22340	26680	And I'm sure you've noticed the lack of anime reviews and gamergate videos, considering
26680	30560	we wanted more of both to come out at the beginning of May and they've yet to happen.
30560	34600	On top of the hardware problems, Kain went through a pretty bad breakup about 3 weeks
34600	38280	ago, she's pretending like it's not affecting her much but I know better, Dave was completely
38280	41680	unable to help until just a couple weeks ago due to his exam schedule, and we've had some
41680	44520	pretty major things happen to the house that we've had to take care of.
44520	48800	All really boring life stuff, but it's made keeping up with our stuff on YouTube pretty
48800	50000	much impossible.
50000	54380	So we're taking a 5 day uploading break until June 1st, to let us catch up.
54380	58840	On June 1st, No Talent Gaming returns with Mario Sunshine and Pokemon Soul Silver Ball
58840	61340	Lock, again on a twice a day upload schedule.
61340	66760	The next gamergate video will come out, come hell or high water, on Wednesday, June 3rd.
66760	71180	And the new anime review, Devil is a part timer, will be out the following Wednesday,
71180	72180	June 10th.
72180	74780	I'm sorry for the wait and for the disappointment, SF Bros.
74780	77980	I hope you understand, and look forward to us returning in a few days.
