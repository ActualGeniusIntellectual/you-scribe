00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
Sup guys, this is just a short update video letting you all know what's going on.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,560
Our channel is going on a short hiatus until June 1st.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,360
The truth of it is, we've had a run of disasters that have made working on the channel next

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,360
to impossible.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,680
The main reason we've been putting out as many Rogue Legacy videos as we have over the

6
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,640
past couple weeks is because we've been having computer problems and the Rogue Legacy stuff

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,340
was the only thing ready to go before our editing PC started acting up.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,680
And I'm sure you've noticed the lack of anime reviews and gamergate videos, considering

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,560
we wanted more of both to come out at the beginning of May and they've yet to happen.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,600
On top of the hardware problems, Kain went through a pretty bad breakup about 3 weeks

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,280
ago, she's pretending like it's not affecting her much but I know better, Dave was completely

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,680
unable to help until just a couple weeks ago due to his exam schedule, and we've had some

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,520
pretty major things happen to the house that we've had to take care of.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,800
All really boring life stuff, but it's made keeping up with our stuff on YouTube pretty

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,000
much impossible.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,380
So we're taking a 5 day uploading break until June 1st, to let us catch up.

17
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,840
On June 1st, No Talent Gaming returns with Mario Sunshine and Pokemon Soul Silver Ball

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,340
Lock, again on a twice a day upload schedule.

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:06,760
The next gamergate video will come out, come hell or high water, on Wednesday, June 3rd.

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,180
And the new anime review, Devil is a part timer, will be out the following Wednesday,

21
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,180
June 10th.

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,780
I'm sorry for the wait and for the disappointment, SF Bros.

23
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,980
I hope you understand, and look forward to us returning in a few days.
