1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,020
In the Western world, we've got two predominant views on ethics, deontology, where the morality

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,120
of an action is based on if the action is right or wrong under a set of rules, and consequentialism,

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,040
where the morality of an action is based on if the action produces a good outcome. Put simply,

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,500
it's good is good rules versus good is good ends. The most obvious example of deontological ethics

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,100
is a religious code, and due to this, deontological ethics is considered by a lot of fedora tippers

6
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,260
and neckbeard growers to exclusively be the domain of uneducated quasi-religious dumb hicks.

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:41,460
And there's some truth to this view for sure. If you're a 75 IQ pleb just trying to get by in

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,100
life with no understanding aptitude or desire to learn about ethical philosophy, it's probably a

9
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,660
lot easier for someone to tell you that there's a simple enough set of rules to follow to get a

10
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,180
mostly good life. You know, say your prayers and eat your vitamins kind of stuff. The practical

11
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,300
function religion serves for most people is a way to be ethical enough to fit into society

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,420
without having to think about it too hard. And that's a big help for those people who

13
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,380
aren't thinking about it. It's for this reason that excuses to violate a deontological code are

14
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,860
a lot less persuasive than they otherwise would appear to be. The obvious problem with this view

15
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:15,100
is what do you do when the rules you're following are actually bad rules? Or how do you recognize a

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,020
rule is bad at all if the source of morality is the rules themselves? The flaw here is that there

17
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,160
can be an inability to update the morals when they need to be updated. In the face of that flaw,

18
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,600
it's hard to argue with a consequentialist critique of religion or culture. Screw the

19
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,560
rules, they hold us back. Goodness comes from a good result. That's a very appealing argument.

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,080
Who doesn't want good ends? Who doesn't want the world to be better? And who wouldn't do the hard

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,640
but necessary work to make it happen? It makes sense that if an action's outcome creates goodness

22
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,080
but is still against some law or rule, shouldn't we do the action anyway? Shouldn't that law or

23
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,640
rule be updated or discarded as not being congruent with the new reality? Considering

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,120
it like this, I am not surprised at all that the internet's favorite pseudo-intellectuals

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:11,040
are all consequentialists, to the point that they use deontology like a slur. But if it

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,360
sounds like I'm simping for consequentialism, I'm not. Consequential ethics forms the core

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,640
justification of every utopian ideology and underpins the logic of both Marxism and fascism.

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,640
If you can identify equality as having infinite value, then you can commit any number of

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,120
atrocities to obtain that value, and your ethical calculations will still come out in the green.

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,200
What does it matter if you kill six million Jews if the end result is that you create a

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,600
thousand-year Reich? What does it matter if you collectivize all property and purge any who resist

32
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,880
you as reactionaries if the end result is you create the stateless, classless, moneyless society

33
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,440
and bring about the end of history? If the final end is good enough, you can justify any number of

34
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,520
smaller bad ends along the way, because the ethical calculation will ultimately still turn

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,000
up positive. Which brings us to the topic of consent. Let me ask you this question. It's

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,440
going to seem obvious, but bear with me. Why is rape bad? The deontological answer to this question

37
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,680
is easy enough, assuming you subscribe to a set of rules that defines rape as bad. But that's not

38
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,200
a satisfying answer, is it? Rape is bad because it's bad? I mean, yes, but that still doesn't

39
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,360
explain it. At the same time, what is the consequentialist answer to this question?

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,280
Well, firstly, you'll quickly discover that it's actually deontological. In fact,

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,760
all of consequentialist ethics is deontological if you dig deeply enough. Here's a great example.

42
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,400
Take the question, should we kill gay people for being gay? You and I will likely say no,

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,800
we shouldn't. But a radical Islamist who wants to see Sharia law implemented on everybody worldwide

44
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,600
will say yes, of course. And consequentialist thinking can justify both positions. We can say,

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,760
well, killing gay people is a bad end. We're violating their rights. Death and suffering is

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,320
bad, etc. And the radical Islamists can say, well, killing gay people is a good end,

47
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,960
one less sinner on earth. God's will has been enforced, etc, etc. It turns out,

48
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,000
in any consequentialist calculation, what constitutes good ends is ultimately derived

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
by a previously held deontological position. This was one of the greatest discoveries of

50
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,240
Jonathan Haidt's work, that all of morality is ultimately just how you feel. With this in mind,

51
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,160
let's return to that question about consent. You can make the argument that if person A

52
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,000
rapes person B, any pleasure that person A gains from the encounter is dwarfed by person B's pain,

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,960
making it a bad outcome. That seems reasonable. What if 10 people gang rape somebody, or 100,

54
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,640
or a million? It becomes harder and harder to argue that the overwhelming amounts of

55
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,360
satisfaction from such a situation doesn't outweigh the anguish of just one individual.

56
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,840
This is why consequentialism always becomes a tyranny of the majority, because the majority

57
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,880
superior number of positive ends can be directly garnered through the minority's exploitation.

58
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,440
Most consequentialists, at this point, will reply with the following argument. I've even heard

59
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,720
Destiny make it. At some point, an act is so morally bankrupt that regardless of any moral

60
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,520
calculations of the event itself in a vacuum, normalizing that event creates a much worse

61
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,040
society. Destiny calls these hidden ends. Again, this seems reasonable, right? A society where 100

62
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,360
people are allowed to gang rape somebody, because the ethical calculations of that event in a vacuum

63
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,880
might be positive, would still be an unstable, nightmarish society to live in, as those attitudes

64
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,160
towards consent, bodily autonomy, and sex would permeate into other areas of life. You can't really

65
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,120
argue with that. These other negatives are the hidden ends. And it is these hidden ends that

66
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,080
make the action immoral, because the action doesn't happen in a vacuum. So, let's set up

67
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,280
a hypothetical. This will be my analog to Vashj's Coconut Island. Let's call it Dev's Spaceship.

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,040
Let's say there's a large group of people on a spaceship. The spaceship is massively damaged,

69
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,840
and is slowly drifting towards Earth. There is no contact between the ship and anybody outside,

70
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,240
due to the damage to the communication system. There is no hope for survival of anyone,

71
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,040
because the damage upon re-entry will be so catastrophic that nobody on Earth will ever

72
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,640
know what transpired on that ship in its final hours. In this situation, is it morally permissible

73
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,040
from a consequentialist point of view for all of the ship's occupants to gang rape somebody?

74
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,760
If not, then why not? The act itself pleasures more people than it harms. There will be no

75
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,920
normalization of the act in wider society, because the destruction of the ship will completely wipe

76
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,400
away any evidence that it actually happened. This act does exist in a permanent vacuum,

77
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,120
where no matter what happens, the wider society doesn't change. Destiny's hidden ends have been

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,360
accounted for. So what is the consequentialist objection? To any normal person, this still

79
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,080
seems like an obviously immoral act. But consequentialist ethics leaves us entirely

80
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,120
unable to describe why. And the reason for that is simple. Because consent is fundamentally a

81
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,080
deontological value. Let me explain. Consent is a person's voluntary agreement to fulfill

82
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,160
the desires of somebody else. This applies to not only sexual consent, but all consent.

83
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,680
Let's say you're looking for a job. Some jobs might be farther than you're willing to travel.

84
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,520
Some jobs might have demands on your time that's incompatible with other obligations. Some jobs

85
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,880
might be in a different field than you're willing to work. In all of these examples, what you're

86
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,640
willing to do and what they're willing to pay you for aren't congruent. You can't come to an

87
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,960
agreement. But let's say you do find a job where it's congruent, where you are willing to do what

88
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,280
your boss pays you to do. In this situation, your boss doesn't have the right to force you to work

89
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,920
at gunpoint. Indeed, you don't have to show up. But in exchange for your consent to that job,

90
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,320
he consents to give you money. You both have a desire, and you both consent to giving up

91
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,080
something to see that desire met. Additionally, while you're consenting to work, you're also

92
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,120
consenting not to do any range of other possible things during that time period. Consider this red

93
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,280
circle to be all the possible things you can do at any given moment. Now consider this green circle

94
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,000
is what your boss wants you to do. If you want to get paid, aka you want your boss to consent to

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,880
give you his money, you have to consent to do only the things within the green circle and to consent

96
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,200
not to do the other things in the red circle. In other words, in exchange for the money you want,

97
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,160
you are consenting to narrow your range of possible actions. And your boss's behaviors also

98
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,480
overlap with a similar diagram. He is also consenting to narrow his range of possible actions

99
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,360
too. This is what a voluntary exchange is when both parties are being honest, consenting to do

100
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,760
a specific thing at the expense of other possibilities. And the trade-off for that loss

101
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,160
of possibility is that you satisfy each other's desires. Sex works the same way. When you consent

102
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,160
to sex with another person, they're also, presumably, consenting to sex with you. And

103
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,000
additionally, whatever else comes along with that relationship, whether it be casual or serious.

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,800
This is why informed consent actually makes sense, at least to some reasonable degree. For example,

105
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,280
if one person is consenting to sex under some preconceived notion of exclusivity and the other

106
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,320
person violates that notion, it absolutely feels like a violation of consent. Just ask anybody

107
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,480
who's been cheated on. But what's important for our discussion is that all of this stuff describes

108
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,560
a non-religious deontological framework. When you enter into a friendship, a romantic relationship,

109
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,320
a business relationship, there are rules for your interactions within that framework, whether

110
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,200
they're explicitly stated or not. When you consent to bind yourself to a series of rules in exchange

111
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,520
for some benefit at the expense of other possible options, you are choosing to operate within a

112
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,560
deontological framework. And then if you violate those rules, even if there's no bad outcome that

113
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,640
a consequentialist could point to, you've still violated the agreement. But this is why your

114
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,720
average consequentialist will never actually consider somebody's word to have any worth.

115
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,120
This is why socialists online will lie to your face if it means that they win. And sometimes

116
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,360
they're dumb enough to tell you that. You call it selling out your principles. I call it fucking

117
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:12,640
winning. And that's my principle. To win as a socialist, not to lose as a socialist. That's

118
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,440
not my principle. I don't give a fuck about principled failure. Principled failure is worth

119
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,240
dog shit. What is honor to a person who only believes in material conditions, who thinks that

120
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,120
the word of another carries no weight? There's a series of two examples, both related to labor,

121
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,600
that can prove my point here. The first one is workplace safety. Consider a boss who is violating

122
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,000
the safety code in order to cut corners and be a bit more productive at the expense of his workers.

123
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,640
A socialist might appeal to the deontological consideration of the code itself, but when pushed,

124
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,600
they will fall back to the consequentialist answer of actual safety and harm. The safety code exists

125
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,320
to avoid accidents. So even if the boss's corner cutting doesn't result in any accidents this time,

126
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,080
it absolutely could later. And we don't want to normalize that behavior and cause more accidents

127
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,440
down the line. The second example is arriving to work on time. Consider a worker who is routinely

128
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,920
late for a shift. Every dumb twitter commie will say something like, good on you, fight the power,

129
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,240
boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, fuck the man over every possible way you can, steal back from

130
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,360
them, etc. The consequences of this act doesn't affect them but the bosses they hate so much.

131
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,000
And the deontological concern, that you gave your word to be at a specific place and time,

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,720
that you gave your consent in exchange for your boss's consent to give you money, in fact,

133
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,640
doesn't actually matter to them. If you can violate consent to get a better deal,

134
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,040
the socialist will advise you to do it because the better deal is a good outcome and consent

135
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,320
is deontological. It is a product of agreements, not outcomes. Understanding that consent works

136
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,960
in this way explains why people on the left have such a hard time with respecting it. And while

137
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,520
I'm certainly being cheeky right now, I don't only mean in the context of sexual assault or

138
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,080
pedophilia. Let's return to employment. A common socialist position is that workers cannot truly

139
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,160
consent to employment because of power imbalances. The workers will die without getting paid and

140
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,720
buying the food they need and so their boss is willing to exploit that need. Because starvation

141
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,520
is a gun to the worker's head, to use the socialist phrasing, no negotiation between workers

142
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,400
and bosses ever actually constitutes consent because workers are always being coerced by bosses.

143
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,320
By the way, this is the point that Vosch's Coconut Island tries to illustrate. The problem with this

144
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,160
view is that it rests atop the idea that two parties who negotiate from different positions

145
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,720
of power can never truly be negotiating because they aren't holding the exact same cards in their

146
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,200
hand. One person will always have a better position and therefore they will always be

147
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,600
exploiting the weaker party and so it's never truly consent. The natural end result of this

148
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,800
view is the complete destruction of the very concept of negotiation since nobody is ever

149
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,160
perfectly equal. And if you were a revolutionary communist who only believed in consequentialist

150
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,960
ethics and was willing to do any number of deontologically bad things to achieve your ideal

151
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,680
end, undermining the concept of negotiation itself by rendering it invalid and therefore

152
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,240
only leaving violence on the table is absolutely something that you would want to do. But what

153
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,960
makes negotiation legitimate is not the relative bargaining strength of the various parties,

154
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,680
it's consent. If you are a person who wants negotiation destroyed, if you don't consider

155
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,520
agreements to be valid because of their deontological nature, then there is absolutely no

156
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,640
way in hell you can actually value consent. There is no consequentialist justification for consent

157
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,360
itself. Only a vague understanding that a society which devalues consent can be a bad

158
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,160
society to live in and if you think that society is somehow good then there is just no reason to

159
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,280
value consent at all. Consent seems to rest atop of some understanding of natural law. If we are

160
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,760
individuals with free will then we can both give consent and be held responsible for our actions.

161
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,040
Marxism as a school of thought entirely rejects this notion. I love going back to this essay,

162
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,640
the title always makes me laugh, but in Marx's On the Jewish Question, he devotes the middle

163
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,760
third of the essay to condemning France's 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the

164
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,360
citizen for offering up a definition of rights that is too liberal. Here are his criticisms and

165
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,360
bear with me, it will be a little bit long but I want to make the point clear. Above all we note

166
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,280
the fact that the so-called rights of man are nothing but the rights of a member of civil

167
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,320
society, i.e. the rights of egotistic man, of man separated from other men and from the community.

168
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,840
Article two, these rights are equality, liberty, security and property. What constitutes liberty?

169
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,240
Article six, liberty is the power which man has to do everything that does not harm the rights of

170
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,880
others. Liberty therefore is the right to do everything that harms no one else. The limits

171
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,200
within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law just as the

172
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,600
boundary between two fields determined by a post. It is the question of the liberty of man as an

173
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,560
isolated monad withdrawn into himself but the right of man to liberty is based not on the

174
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,280
association of man with man but on the separation of man from man. It is the right of this

175
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,080
separation, the right of the restricted individual, withdrawn into himself. The practical application

176
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,800
of man's right to liberty is man's right to private property. What constitutes man's right to

177
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,640
private property? Article 16, the right of property is that which every citizen has of enjoying and of

178
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,920
disposing at his discretion of his goods and income of the fruits of his labor and industry.

179
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,480
The right of man to private property is, therefore, the right to enjoy one's property

180
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,880
and to dispose of it at one's discretion, without regard to other men, independently of society,

181
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,520
the right of self-interest. This individual liberty and its application form the basis of

182
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,400
civil society. It makes every man see another man not the realization of his own freedom

183
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,520
but the barrier to it. Equality used here in its non-political sense is nothing but the equality

184
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,240
of liberty as described above. Namely each man is to the same extent regarded as such a

185
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,440
self-sufficient monad. In security, Article 8, security consists in the protection afforded

186
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,520
by society to each of its members for the preservation of his person, his rights, and his

187
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,200
property. Security is the highest social concept of civil society, the concept of police, expressing

188
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,520
the fact that the whole of society exists only in order to guarantee to each of its members the

189
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,160
preservation of his person, his rights, and his property. The concept of security does not raise

190
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,680
a civil society above its egoism. On the contrary, security is the insurance of egoism. None of the

191
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,040
so-called rights of man, therefore, go beyond egotistic man, beyond man as a member of civil

192
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,680
society, that is, an individual withdrawn into himself, into the confines of his private interests

193
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,240
and private caprice, and separated from his community. In the rights of man, he is far from

194
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,520
being conceived as a species being. On the contrary, species life itself, society, appears as

195
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,000
a framework external to the individual, as a restriction of their original independence. The

196
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,240
sole bond holding them together is natural necessity, need, and private interest. The

197
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,240
preservation of their property, and their egotistic selves. It is puzzling enough that

198
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,080
a people which is just beginning to liberate itself, to tear down all barriers between its

199
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,240
various sections, and to establish a political community, that such a people solemnly proclaim

200
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,160
the rights of egotistic man separated from his fellow men and from the community. Here's what

201
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,840
Marx said in a lot fewer words. The liberal conception of rights as being a product of

202
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,720
natural law, aka natural rights, is too individualistic. It ignores collective concerns.

203
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,400
This passage forms the Marxist basis for the rejection of rights. It is the right of people

204
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,160
to stand apart, but not the right of people to be brought closer together. One of the biggest

205
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,960
reasons as to why Marx is incredibly stupid, is that the individual does not actually need a right

206
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,600
to be brought closer together, but the individual does need the right to stand apart. If people want

207
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,480
to be closer, they can voluntarily choose to do so. No rights are required for that beyond consent,

208
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,280
but if people do not want to be closer, if they actually want to be disassociated, disconnected,

209
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,760
if in more practical terms they want to be free of an abuser or a rapist or a manipulator,

210
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,560
then in a liberal society they have that right to stand apart. Imagine a Marxist society where the

211
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,520
right to be brought closer together is enshrined. Imagine an abuser having the right to be close to

212
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,040
their victim out of a sense of Marxist illiberal anti-individualism. That is what Marx is saying

213
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,480
when he critiques the liberal idea of rights as an individual withdrawn into himself, into the

214
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,000
confines of his private interests. When he says, the right of man to liberty is based not on the

215
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,600
association of man with man, but on the separation of man from man, his critique is that the liberal

216
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,360
conception of rights does not allow people to be forced together. It is for this reason that

217
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,560
Marxists have never respected consent. Not consent to ownership, not consent to labor, and not sexual

218
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,400
consent. It is in their ideology to actively reject consent as part of liberal egoism,

219
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,000
of bourgeois privacy. Consent is deontological in nature, and deontological ethics are ultimately

220
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,040
just capitalist constructions that the Marxist needs to see torn down, and because to the Marxist

221
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,480
individual concerns are second rate, the consent of the individual is not required within a Marxist

222
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,720
society. At this point in my ethical understanding I'm not a consequentialist or a deontologician,

223
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,120
but a virtue ethicist. Thanks Sargon's reading suggestions for that. Virtue ethics posits that

224
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,920
it's not only good rules or good ends that create goodness, though both of those things play a role,

225
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,200
but it's also good habits. In other words, you are what you consistently do. Cultivating a character

226
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,040
with positive traits, aka virtues, and not with negative traits, aka vices, creates good people.

227
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,240
Moreover, in virtue ethics moral content lies not just in the deliberation of an act, or the

228
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,960
outcome of an act, but in the act itself. Consider saving somebody from a car accident. You may have

229
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,600
a deontological reason to do so, some legal or religious rule to follow. You may understand the

230
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,640
positive outcome of doing so. Somebody is alive afterward. But the action of saving the life

231
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,560
itself also has moral content, because it shows and builds good moral character in your personality.

232
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:28,880
The bravery, the honor, the self-sacrifice. Consent may be deontological, but it also speaks to virtue.

233
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,880
To consent to do something means, assuming you honor that consent and actually do it,

234
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,200
you're building your character. This is why what you choose to consent to, and not consent to,

235
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,680
is of the utmost importance. And at the same time, you'll also realize that we are far outside of the

236
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,800
socialist framework right now. Socialists don't have proper language within their lens to describe

237
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,960
any of these concepts I'm talking about. They certainly don't practice any of these concepts,

238
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,960
and I think that's why you can pluck any random socialist out of a crowd, and they will probably

239
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,440
be entirely lacking in any sort of virtue. They may pay lip service to the idea of consent,

240
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,480
but they cannot truly understand why it is so vitally important, and what it actually does to

241
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,960
you, and to others, when you give consent and follow through. For all of consequentialism's

242
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,120
good components, and give the devil his due, there are a lot of them, there is no room within

243
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,000
a consequentialist framework for the concept of consent. If you value consent, then you must value

244
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,400
your honor, and you must be able to trust others at their word. This requires some notion of

245
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,440
deontological ethics. If you meet a person who just completely ignores deontological ethics on

246
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,040
principle, you will likely discover that they actually have no principles at all.
