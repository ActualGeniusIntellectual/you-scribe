0	10020	In the Western world, we've got two predominant views on ethics, deontology, where the morality
10020	15120	of an action is based on if the action is right or wrong under a set of rules, and consequentialism,
15120	20040	where the morality of an action is based on if the action produces a good outcome. Put simply,
20040	25500	it's good is good rules versus good is good ends. The most obvious example of deontological ethics
25500	30100	is a religious code, and due to this, deontological ethics is considered by a lot of fedora tippers
30100	35260	and neckbeard growers to exclusively be the domain of uneducated quasi-religious dumb hicks.
35260	41460	And there's some truth to this view for sure. If you're a 75 IQ pleb just trying to get by in
41460	46100	life with no understanding aptitude or desire to learn about ethical philosophy, it's probably a
46100	49660	lot easier for someone to tell you that there's a simple enough set of rules to follow to get a
49660	54180	mostly good life. You know, say your prayers and eat your vitamins kind of stuff. The practical
54180	58300	function religion serves for most people is a way to be ethical enough to fit into society
58300	61420	without having to think about it too hard. And that's a big help for those people who
61420	65380	aren't thinking about it. It's for this reason that excuses to violate a deontological code are
65380	69860	a lot less persuasive than they otherwise would appear to be. The obvious problem with this view
69860	75100	is what do you do when the rules you're following are actually bad rules? Or how do you recognize a
75100	80020	rule is bad at all if the source of morality is the rules themselves? The flaw here is that there
80020	84160	can be an inability to update the morals when they need to be updated. In the face of that flaw,
84680	88600	it's hard to argue with a consequentialist critique of religion or culture. Screw the
88600	92560	rules, they hold us back. Goodness comes from a good result. That's a very appealing argument.
92560	97080	Who doesn't want good ends? Who doesn't want the world to be better? And who wouldn't do the hard
97080	102640	but necessary work to make it happen? It makes sense that if an action's outcome creates goodness
102640	108080	but is still against some law or rule, shouldn't we do the action anyway? Shouldn't that law or
108080	112640	rule be updated or discarded as not being congruent with the new reality? Considering
112640	117120	it like this, I am not surprised at all that the internet's favorite pseudo-intellectuals
117120	131040	are all consequentialists, to the point that they use deontology like a slur. But if it
131040	135360	sounds like I'm simping for consequentialism, I'm not. Consequential ethics forms the core
135360	140640	justification of every utopian ideology and underpins the logic of both Marxism and fascism.
140640	144640	If you can identify equality as having infinite value, then you can commit any number of
144640	149120	atrocities to obtain that value, and your ethical calculations will still come out in the green.
149120	153200	What does it matter if you kill six million Jews if the end result is that you create a
153200	157600	thousand-year Reich? What does it matter if you collectivize all property and purge any who resist
157600	162880	you as reactionaries if the end result is you create the stateless, classless, moneyless society
162880	167440	and bring about the end of history? If the final end is good enough, you can justify any number of
167440	171520	smaller bad ends along the way, because the ethical calculation will ultimately still turn
171520	176000	up positive. Which brings us to the topic of consent. Let me ask you this question. It's
176000	181440	going to seem obvious, but bear with me. Why is rape bad? The deontological answer to this question
181440	185680	is easy enough, assuming you subscribe to a set of rules that defines rape as bad. But that's not
185680	191200	a satisfying answer, is it? Rape is bad because it's bad? I mean, yes, but that still doesn't
191200	195360	explain it. At the same time, what is the consequentialist answer to this question?
195360	199280	Well, firstly, you'll quickly discover that it's actually deontological. In fact,
199280	203760	all of consequentialist ethics is deontological if you dig deeply enough. Here's a great example.
203760	208400	Take the question, should we kill gay people for being gay? You and I will likely say no,
208400	212800	we shouldn't. But a radical Islamist who wants to see Sharia law implemented on everybody worldwide
212800	217600	will say yes, of course. And consequentialist thinking can justify both positions. We can say,
217600	221760	well, killing gay people is a bad end. We're violating their rights. Death and suffering is
221760	226320	bad, etc. And the radical Islamists can say, well, killing gay people is a good end,
226320	230960	one less sinner on earth. God's will has been enforced, etc, etc. It turns out,
230960	236000	in any consequentialist calculation, what constitutes good ends is ultimately derived
236000	239680	by a previously held deontological position. This was one of the greatest discoveries of
239680	244240	Jonathan Haidt's work, that all of morality is ultimately just how you feel. With this in mind,
244240	248160	let's return to that question about consent. You can make the argument that if person A
248160	254000	rapes person B, any pleasure that person A gains from the encounter is dwarfed by person B's pain,
254000	258960	making it a bad outcome. That seems reasonable. What if 10 people gang rape somebody, or 100,
258960	262640	or a million? It becomes harder and harder to argue that the overwhelming amounts of
262640	267360	satisfaction from such a situation doesn't outweigh the anguish of just one individual.
267360	271840	This is why consequentialism always becomes a tyranny of the majority, because the majority
271840	276880	superior number of positive ends can be directly garnered through the minority's exploitation.
276880	281440	Most consequentialists, at this point, will reply with the following argument. I've even heard
281440	286720	Destiny make it. At some point, an act is so morally bankrupt that regardless of any moral
286720	291520	calculations of the event itself in a vacuum, normalizing that event creates a much worse
291520	297040	society. Destiny calls these hidden ends. Again, this seems reasonable, right? A society where 100
297040	301360	people are allowed to gang rape somebody, because the ethical calculations of that event in a vacuum
301360	306880	might be positive, would still be an unstable, nightmarish society to live in, as those attitudes
306880	312160	towards consent, bodily autonomy, and sex would permeate into other areas of life. You can't really
312160	317120	argue with that. These other negatives are the hidden ends. And it is these hidden ends that
317120	322080	make the action immoral, because the action doesn't happen in a vacuum. So, let's set up
322080	327280	a hypothetical. This will be my analog to Vashj's Coconut Island. Let's call it Dev's Spaceship.
327280	331040	Let's say there's a large group of people on a spaceship. The spaceship is massively damaged,
331040	335840	and is slowly drifting towards Earth. There is no contact between the ship and anybody outside,
335840	340240	due to the damage to the communication system. There is no hope for survival of anyone,
340240	345040	because the damage upon re-entry will be so catastrophic that nobody on Earth will ever
345040	350640	know what transpired on that ship in its final hours. In this situation, is it morally permissible
350640	355040	from a consequentialist point of view for all of the ship's occupants to gang rape somebody?
355040	359760	If not, then why not? The act itself pleasures more people than it harms. There will be no
359760	363920	normalization of the act in wider society, because the destruction of the ship will completely wipe
363920	368400	away any evidence that it actually happened. This act does exist in a permanent vacuum,
368400	373120	where no matter what happens, the wider society doesn't change. Destiny's hidden ends have been
373120	377360	accounted for. So what is the consequentialist objection? To any normal person, this still
377360	382080	seems like an obviously immoral act. But consequentialist ethics leaves us entirely
382080	387120	unable to describe why. And the reason for that is simple. Because consent is fundamentally a
387120	392080	deontological value. Let me explain. Consent is a person's voluntary agreement to fulfill
392080	396160	the desires of somebody else. This applies to not only sexual consent, but all consent.
396160	399680	Let's say you're looking for a job. Some jobs might be farther than you're willing to travel.
399680	403520	Some jobs might have demands on your time that's incompatible with other obligations. Some jobs
403520	406880	might be in a different field than you're willing to work. In all of these examples, what you're
406880	410640	willing to do and what they're willing to pay you for aren't congruent. You can't come to an
410640	414960	agreement. But let's say you do find a job where it's congruent, where you are willing to do what
414960	419280	your boss pays you to do. In this situation, your boss doesn't have the right to force you to work
419280	423920	at gunpoint. Indeed, you don't have to show up. But in exchange for your consent to that job,
423920	428320	he consents to give you money. You both have a desire, and you both consent to giving up
428320	432080	something to see that desire met. Additionally, while you're consenting to work, you're also
432080	437120	consenting not to do any range of other possible things during that time period. Consider this red
437120	441280	circle to be all the possible things you can do at any given moment. Now consider this green circle
441280	446000	is what your boss wants you to do. If you want to get paid, aka you want your boss to consent to
446000	450880	give you his money, you have to consent to do only the things within the green circle and to consent
450880	455200	not to do the other things in the red circle. In other words, in exchange for the money you want,
455200	460160	you are consenting to narrow your range of possible actions. And your boss's behaviors also
460160	464480	overlap with a similar diagram. He is also consenting to narrow his range of possible actions
464480	469360	too. This is what a voluntary exchange is when both parties are being honest, consenting to do
469360	473760	a specific thing at the expense of other possibilities. And the trade-off for that loss
473760	478160	of possibility is that you satisfy each other's desires. Sex works the same way. When you consent
478160	482160	to sex with another person, they're also, presumably, consenting to sex with you. And
482160	486000	additionally, whatever else comes along with that relationship, whether it be casual or serious.
486000	490800	This is why informed consent actually makes sense, at least to some reasonable degree. For example,
490800	495280	if one person is consenting to sex under some preconceived notion of exclusivity and the other
495280	500320	person violates that notion, it absolutely feels like a violation of consent. Just ask anybody
500320	504480	who's been cheated on. But what's important for our discussion is that all of this stuff describes
504480	508560	a non-religious deontological framework. When you enter into a friendship, a romantic relationship,
508560	512320	a business relationship, there are rules for your interactions within that framework, whether
512320	517200	they're explicitly stated or not. When you consent to bind yourself to a series of rules in exchange
517200	521520	for some benefit at the expense of other possible options, you are choosing to operate within a
521520	526560	deontological framework. And then if you violate those rules, even if there's no bad outcome that
526560	530640	a consequentialist could point to, you've still violated the agreement. But this is why your
530640	534720	average consequentialist will never actually consider somebody's word to have any worth.
534720	539120	This is why socialists online will lie to your face if it means that they win. And sometimes
539120	543360	they're dumb enough to tell you that. You call it selling out your principles. I call it fucking
543360	552640	winning. And that's my principle. To win as a socialist, not to lose as a socialist. That's
552640	559440	not my principle. I don't give a fuck about principled failure. Principled failure is worth
559440	564240	dog shit. What is honor to a person who only believes in material conditions, who thinks that
564240	569120	the word of another carries no weight? There's a series of two examples, both related to labor,
569120	573600	that can prove my point here. The first one is workplace safety. Consider a boss who is violating
573600	578000	the safety code in order to cut corners and be a bit more productive at the expense of his workers.
578000	582640	A socialist might appeal to the deontological consideration of the code itself, but when pushed,
582640	587600	they will fall back to the consequentialist answer of actual safety and harm. The safety code exists
587600	592320	to avoid accidents. So even if the boss's corner cutting doesn't result in any accidents this time,
592320	596080	it absolutely could later. And we don't want to normalize that behavior and cause more accidents
596080	601440	down the line. The second example is arriving to work on time. Consider a worker who is routinely
601440	605920	late for a shift. Every dumb twitter commie will say something like, good on you, fight the power,
605920	610240	boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, fuck the man over every possible way you can, steal back from
610240	615360	them, etc. The consequences of this act doesn't affect them but the bosses they hate so much.
615360	620000	And the deontological concern, that you gave your word to be at a specific place and time,
620000	624720	that you gave your consent in exchange for your boss's consent to give you money, in fact,
624800	628640	doesn't actually matter to them. If you can violate consent to get a better deal,
628640	633040	the socialist will advise you to do it because the better deal is a good outcome and consent
633040	638320	is deontological. It is a product of agreements, not outcomes. Understanding that consent works
638320	642960	in this way explains why people on the left have such a hard time with respecting it. And while
642960	647520	I'm certainly being cheeky right now, I don't only mean in the context of sexual assault or
647520	652080	pedophilia. Let's return to employment. A common socialist position is that workers cannot truly
652080	656160	consent to employment because of power imbalances. The workers will die without getting paid and
656160	660720	buying the food they need and so their boss is willing to exploit that need. Because starvation
660720	665520	is a gun to the worker's head, to use the socialist phrasing, no negotiation between workers
665520	670400	and bosses ever actually constitutes consent because workers are always being coerced by bosses.
670400	674320	By the way, this is the point that Vosch's Coconut Island tries to illustrate. The problem with this
674320	678160	view is that it rests atop the idea that two parties who negotiate from different positions
678160	682720	of power can never truly be negotiating because they aren't holding the exact same cards in their
682720	687200	hand. One person will always have a better position and therefore they will always be
687200	691600	exploiting the weaker party and so it's never truly consent. The natural end result of this
691600	696800	view is the complete destruction of the very concept of negotiation since nobody is ever
696800	702160	perfectly equal. And if you were a revolutionary communist who only believed in consequentialist
702160	706960	ethics and was willing to do any number of deontologically bad things to achieve your ideal
706960	711680	end, undermining the concept of negotiation itself by rendering it invalid and therefore
711680	716240	only leaving violence on the table is absolutely something that you would want to do. But what
716240	720960	makes negotiation legitimate is not the relative bargaining strength of the various parties,
720960	725680	it's consent. If you are a person who wants negotiation destroyed, if you don't consider
725680	729520	agreements to be valid because of their deontological nature, then there is absolutely no
729520	734640	way in hell you can actually value consent. There is no consequentialist justification for consent
734640	739360	itself. Only a vague understanding that a society which devalues consent can be a bad
739360	744160	society to live in and if you think that society is somehow good then there is just no reason to
744160	749280	value consent at all. Consent seems to rest atop of some understanding of natural law. If we are
749280	753760	individuals with free will then we can both give consent and be held responsible for our actions.
753760	759040	Marxism as a school of thought entirely rejects this notion. I love going back to this essay,
759040	764640	the title always makes me laugh, but in Marx's On the Jewish Question, he devotes the middle
764640	769760	third of the essay to condemning France's 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the
769760	775360	citizen for offering up a definition of rights that is too liberal. Here are his criticisms and
775360	779360	bear with me, it will be a little bit long but I want to make the point clear. Above all we note
779360	783280	the fact that the so-called rights of man are nothing but the rights of a member of civil
783280	788320	society, i.e. the rights of egotistic man, of man separated from other men and from the community.
788320	793840	Article two, these rights are equality, liberty, security and property. What constitutes liberty?
793840	798240	Article six, liberty is the power which man has to do everything that does not harm the rights of
798240	802880	others. Liberty therefore is the right to do everything that harms no one else. The limits
802880	807200	within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law just as the
807200	811600	boundary between two fields determined by a post. It is the question of the liberty of man as an
811600	816560	isolated monad withdrawn into himself but the right of man to liberty is based not on the
816560	821280	association of man with man but on the separation of man from man. It is the right of this
821280	826080	separation, the right of the restricted individual, withdrawn into himself. The practical application
826080	830800	of man's right to liberty is man's right to private property. What constitutes man's right to
830800	836640	private property? Article 16, the right of property is that which every citizen has of enjoying and of
836640	841920	disposing at his discretion of his goods and income of the fruits of his labor and industry.
841920	846480	The right of man to private property is, therefore, the right to enjoy one's property
846480	850880	and to dispose of it at one's discretion, without regard to other men, independently of society,
850880	855520	the right of self-interest. This individual liberty and its application form the basis of
855520	860400	civil society. It makes every man see another man not the realization of his own freedom
860400	865520	but the barrier to it. Equality used here in its non-political sense is nothing but the equality
865520	870240	of liberty as described above. Namely each man is to the same extent regarded as such a
870240	875440	self-sufficient monad. In security, Article 8, security consists in the protection afforded
875440	879520	by society to each of its members for the preservation of his person, his rights, and his
879520	885200	property. Security is the highest social concept of civil society, the concept of police, expressing
885200	889520	the fact that the whole of society exists only in order to guarantee to each of its members the
889520	894160	preservation of his person, his rights, and his property. The concept of security does not raise
894160	899680	a civil society above its egoism. On the contrary, security is the insurance of egoism. None of the
899680	905040	so-called rights of man, therefore, go beyond egotistic man, beyond man as a member of civil
905040	909680	society, that is, an individual withdrawn into himself, into the confines of his private interests
909680	914240	and private caprice, and separated from his community. In the rights of man, he is far from
914240	919520	being conceived as a species being. On the contrary, species life itself, society, appears as
919520	924000	a framework external to the individual, as a restriction of their original independence. The
924000	928240	sole bond holding them together is natural necessity, need, and private interest. The
928240	932240	preservation of their property, and their egotistic selves. It is puzzling enough that
932240	936080	a people which is just beginning to liberate itself, to tear down all barriers between its
936080	940240	various sections, and to establish a political community, that such a people solemnly proclaim
940240	944160	the rights of egotistic man separated from his fellow men and from the community. Here's what
944160	947840	Marx said in a lot fewer words. The liberal conception of rights as being a product of
947840	952720	natural law, aka natural rights, is too individualistic. It ignores collective concerns.
952720	958400	This passage forms the Marxist basis for the rejection of rights. It is the right of people
958400	962160	to stand apart, but not the right of people to be brought closer together. One of the biggest
962160	966960	reasons as to why Marx is incredibly stupid, is that the individual does not actually need a right
966960	971600	to be brought closer together, but the individual does need the right to stand apart. If people want
971600	976480	to be closer, they can voluntarily choose to do so. No rights are required for that beyond consent,
976480	981280	but if people do not want to be closer, if they actually want to be disassociated, disconnected,
981280	985760	if in more practical terms they want to be free of an abuser or a rapist or a manipulator,
985760	990560	then in a liberal society they have that right to stand apart. Imagine a Marxist society where the
990560	995520	right to be brought closer together is enshrined. Imagine an abuser having the right to be close to
995520	1001040	their victim out of a sense of Marxist illiberal anti-individualism. That is what Marx is saying
1001040	1006480	when he critiques the liberal idea of rights as an individual withdrawn into himself, into the
1006480	1012000	confines of his private interests. When he says, the right of man to liberty is based not on the
1012000	1017600	association of man with man, but on the separation of man from man, his critique is that the liberal
1017600	1023360	conception of rights does not allow people to be forced together. It is for this reason that
1023360	1030560	Marxists have never respected consent. Not consent to ownership, not consent to labor, and not sexual
1030560	1036400	consent. It is in their ideology to actively reject consent as part of liberal egoism,
1036400	1042000	of bourgeois privacy. Consent is deontological in nature, and deontological ethics are ultimately
1042000	1047040	just capitalist constructions that the Marxist needs to see torn down, and because to the Marxist
1047040	1052480	individual concerns are second rate, the consent of the individual is not required within a Marxist
1052480	1056720	society. At this point in my ethical understanding I'm not a consequentialist or a deontologician,
1056720	1061120	but a virtue ethicist. Thanks Sargon's reading suggestions for that. Virtue ethics posits that
1061120	1065920	it's not only good rules or good ends that create goodness, though both of those things play a role,
1065920	1071200	but it's also good habits. In other words, you are what you consistently do. Cultivating a character
1071200	1077040	with positive traits, aka virtues, and not with negative traits, aka vices, creates good people.
1077040	1082240	Moreover, in virtue ethics moral content lies not just in the deliberation of an act, or the
1082240	1086960	outcome of an act, but in the act itself. Consider saving somebody from a car accident. You may have
1086960	1091600	a deontological reason to do so, some legal or religious rule to follow. You may understand the
1091600	1096640	positive outcome of doing so. Somebody is alive afterward. But the action of saving the life
1096640	1102560	itself also has moral content, because it shows and builds good moral character in your personality.
1102560	1108880	The bravery, the honor, the self-sacrifice. Consent may be deontological, but it also speaks to virtue.
1108880	1112880	To consent to do something means, assuming you honor that consent and actually do it,
1112880	1117200	you're building your character. This is why what you choose to consent to, and not consent to,
1117200	1121680	is of the utmost importance. And at the same time, you'll also realize that we are far outside of the
1121680	1126800	socialist framework right now. Socialists don't have proper language within their lens to describe
1126800	1130960	any of these concepts I'm talking about. They certainly don't practice any of these concepts,
1130960	1134960	and I think that's why you can pluck any random socialist out of a crowd, and they will probably
1134960	1139440	be entirely lacking in any sort of virtue. They may pay lip service to the idea of consent,
1139440	1144480	but they cannot truly understand why it is so vitally important, and what it actually does to
1144480	1148960	you, and to others, when you give consent and follow through. For all of consequentialism's
1148960	1153120	good components, and give the devil his due, there are a lot of them, there is no room within
1153120	1158000	a consequentialist framework for the concept of consent. If you value consent, then you must value
1158000	1162400	your honor, and you must be able to trust others at their word. This requires some notion of
1162400	1167440	deontological ethics. If you meet a person who just completely ignores deontological ethics on
1167440	1171040	principle, you will likely discover that they actually have no principles at all.
