00:00.000 --> 00:10.020
In the Western world, we've got two predominant views on ethics, deontology, where the morality

00:10.020 --> 00:15.120
of an action is based on if the action is right or wrong under a set of rules, and consequentialism,

00:15.120 --> 00:20.040
where the morality of an action is based on if the action produces a good outcome. Put simply,

00:20.040 --> 00:25.500
it's good is good rules versus good is good ends. The most obvious example of deontological ethics

00:25.500 --> 00:30.100
is a religious code, and due to this, deontological ethics is considered by a lot of fedora tippers

00:30.100 --> 00:35.260
and neckbeard growers to exclusively be the domain of uneducated quasi-religious dumb hicks.

00:35.260 --> 00:41.460
And there's some truth to this view for sure. If you're a 75 IQ pleb just trying to get by in

00:41.460 --> 00:46.100
life with no understanding aptitude or desire to learn about ethical philosophy, it's probably a

00:46.100 --> 00:49.660
lot easier for someone to tell you that there's a simple enough set of rules to follow to get a

00:49.660 --> 00:54.180
mostly good life. You know, say your prayers and eat your vitamins kind of stuff. The practical

00:54.180 --> 00:58.300
function religion serves for most people is a way to be ethical enough to fit into society

00:58.300 --> 01:01.420
without having to think about it too hard. And that's a big help for those people who

01:01.420 --> 01:05.380
aren't thinking about it. It's for this reason that excuses to violate a deontological code are

01:05.380 --> 01:09.860
a lot less persuasive than they otherwise would appear to be. The obvious problem with this view

01:09.860 --> 01:15.100
is what do you do when the rules you're following are actually bad rules? Or how do you recognize a

01:15.100 --> 01:20.020
rule is bad at all if the source of morality is the rules themselves? The flaw here is that there

01:20.020 --> 01:24.160
can be an inability to update the morals when they need to be updated. In the face of that flaw,

01:24.680 --> 01:28.600
it's hard to argue with a consequentialist critique of religion or culture. Screw the

01:28.600 --> 01:32.560
rules, they hold us back. Goodness comes from a good result. That's a very appealing argument.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.080
Who doesn't want good ends? Who doesn't want the world to be better? And who wouldn't do the hard

01:37.080 --> 01:42.640
but necessary work to make it happen? It makes sense that if an action's outcome creates goodness

01:42.640 --> 01:48.080
but is still against some law or rule, shouldn't we do the action anyway? Shouldn't that law or

01:48.080 --> 01:52.640
rule be updated or discarded as not being congruent with the new reality? Considering

01:52.640 --> 01:57.120
it like this, I am not surprised at all that the internet's favorite pseudo-intellectuals

01:57.120 --> 02:11.040
are all consequentialists, to the point that they use deontology like a slur. But if it

02:11.040 --> 02:15.360
sounds like I'm simping for consequentialism, I'm not. Consequential ethics forms the core

02:15.360 --> 02:20.640
justification of every utopian ideology and underpins the logic of both Marxism and fascism.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.640
If you can identify equality as having infinite value, then you can commit any number of

02:24.640 --> 02:29.120
atrocities to obtain that value, and your ethical calculations will still come out in the green.

02:29.120 --> 02:33.200
What does it matter if you kill six million Jews if the end result is that you create a

02:33.200 --> 02:37.600
thousand-year Reich? What does it matter if you collectivize all property and purge any who resist

02:37.600 --> 02:42.880
you as reactionaries if the end result is you create the stateless, classless, moneyless society

02:42.880 --> 02:47.440
and bring about the end of history? If the final end is good enough, you can justify any number of

02:47.440 --> 02:51.520
smaller bad ends along the way, because the ethical calculation will ultimately still turn

02:51.520 --> 02:56.000
up positive. Which brings us to the topic of consent. Let me ask you this question. It's

02:56.000 --> 03:01.440
going to seem obvious, but bear with me. Why is rape bad? The deontological answer to this question

03:01.440 --> 03:05.680
is easy enough, assuming you subscribe to a set of rules that defines rape as bad. But that's not

03:05.680 --> 03:11.200
a satisfying answer, is it? Rape is bad because it's bad? I mean, yes, but that still doesn't

03:11.200 --> 03:15.360
explain it. At the same time, what is the consequentialist answer to this question?

03:15.360 --> 03:19.280
Well, firstly, you'll quickly discover that it's actually deontological. In fact,

03:19.280 --> 03:23.760
all of consequentialist ethics is deontological if you dig deeply enough. Here's a great example.

03:23.760 --> 03:28.400
Take the question, should we kill gay people for being gay? You and I will likely say no,

03:28.400 --> 03:32.800
we shouldn't. But a radical Islamist who wants to see Sharia law implemented on everybody worldwide

03:32.800 --> 03:37.600
will say yes, of course. And consequentialist thinking can justify both positions. We can say,

03:37.600 --> 03:41.760
well, killing gay people is a bad end. We're violating their rights. Death and suffering is

03:41.760 --> 03:46.320
bad, etc. And the radical Islamists can say, well, killing gay people is a good end,

03:46.320 --> 03:50.960
one less sinner on earth. God's will has been enforced, etc, etc. It turns out,

03:50.960 --> 03:56.000
in any consequentialist calculation, what constitutes good ends is ultimately derived

03:56.000 --> 03:59.680
by a previously held deontological position. This was one of the greatest discoveries of

03:59.680 --> 04:04.240
Jonathan Haidt's work, that all of morality is ultimately just how you feel. With this in mind,

04:04.240 --> 04:08.160
let's return to that question about consent. You can make the argument that if person A

04:08.160 --> 04:14.000
rapes person B, any pleasure that person A gains from the encounter is dwarfed by person B's pain,

04:14.000 --> 04:18.960
making it a bad outcome. That seems reasonable. What if 10 people gang rape somebody, or 100,

04:18.960 --> 04:22.640
or a million? It becomes harder and harder to argue that the overwhelming amounts of

04:22.640 --> 04:27.360
satisfaction from such a situation doesn't outweigh the anguish of just one individual.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.840
This is why consequentialism always becomes a tyranny of the majority, because the majority

04:31.840 --> 04:36.880
superior number of positive ends can be directly garnered through the minority's exploitation.

04:36.880 --> 04:41.440
Most consequentialists, at this point, will reply with the following argument. I've even heard

04:41.440 --> 04:46.720
Destiny make it. At some point, an act is so morally bankrupt that regardless of any moral

04:46.720 --> 04:51.520
calculations of the event itself in a vacuum, normalizing that event creates a much worse

04:51.520 --> 04:57.040
society. Destiny calls these hidden ends. Again, this seems reasonable, right? A society where 100

04:57.040 --> 05:01.360
people are allowed to gang rape somebody, because the ethical calculations of that event in a vacuum

05:01.360 --> 05:06.880
might be positive, would still be an unstable, nightmarish society to live in, as those attitudes

05:06.880 --> 05:12.160
towards consent, bodily autonomy, and sex would permeate into other areas of life. You can't really

05:12.160 --> 05:17.120
argue with that. These other negatives are the hidden ends. And it is these hidden ends that

05:17.120 --> 05:22.080
make the action immoral, because the action doesn't happen in a vacuum. So, let's set up

05:22.080 --> 05:27.280
a hypothetical. This will be my analog to Vashj's Coconut Island. Let's call it Dev's Spaceship.

05:27.280 --> 05:31.040
Let's say there's a large group of people on a spaceship. The spaceship is massively damaged,

05:31.040 --> 05:35.840
and is slowly drifting towards Earth. There is no contact between the ship and anybody outside,

05:35.840 --> 05:40.240
due to the damage to the communication system. There is no hope for survival of anyone,

05:40.240 --> 05:45.040
because the damage upon re-entry will be so catastrophic that nobody on Earth will ever

05:45.040 --> 05:50.640
know what transpired on that ship in its final hours. In this situation, is it morally permissible

05:50.640 --> 05:55.040
from a consequentialist point of view for all of the ship's occupants to gang rape somebody?

05:55.040 --> 05:59.760
If not, then why not? The act itself pleasures more people than it harms. There will be no

05:59.760 --> 06:03.920
normalization of the act in wider society, because the destruction of the ship will completely wipe

06:03.920 --> 06:08.400
away any evidence that it actually happened. This act does exist in a permanent vacuum,

06:08.400 --> 06:13.120
where no matter what happens, the wider society doesn't change. Destiny's hidden ends have been

06:13.120 --> 06:17.360
accounted for. So what is the consequentialist objection? To any normal person, this still

06:17.360 --> 06:22.080
seems like an obviously immoral act. But consequentialist ethics leaves us entirely

06:22.080 --> 06:27.120
unable to describe why. And the reason for that is simple. Because consent is fundamentally a

06:27.120 --> 06:32.080
deontological value. Let me explain. Consent is a person's voluntary agreement to fulfill

06:32.080 --> 06:36.160
the desires of somebody else. This applies to not only sexual consent, but all consent.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.680
Let's say you're looking for a job. Some jobs might be farther than you're willing to travel.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.520
Some jobs might have demands on your time that's incompatible with other obligations. Some jobs

06:43.520 --> 06:46.880
might be in a different field than you're willing to work. In all of these examples, what you're

06:46.880 --> 06:50.640
willing to do and what they're willing to pay you for aren't congruent. You can't come to an

06:50.640 --> 06:54.960
agreement. But let's say you do find a job where it's congruent, where you are willing to do what

06:54.960 --> 06:59.280
your boss pays you to do. In this situation, your boss doesn't have the right to force you to work

06:59.280 --> 07:03.920
at gunpoint. Indeed, you don't have to show up. But in exchange for your consent to that job,

07:03.920 --> 07:08.320
he consents to give you money. You both have a desire, and you both consent to giving up

07:08.320 --> 07:12.080
something to see that desire met. Additionally, while you're consenting to work, you're also

07:12.080 --> 07:17.120
consenting not to do any range of other possible things during that time period. Consider this red

07:17.120 --> 07:21.280
circle to be all the possible things you can do at any given moment. Now consider this green circle

07:21.280 --> 07:26.000
is what your boss wants you to do. If you want to get paid, aka you want your boss to consent to

07:26.000 --> 07:30.880
give you his money, you have to consent to do only the things within the green circle and to consent

07:30.880 --> 07:35.200
not to do the other things in the red circle. In other words, in exchange for the money you want,

07:35.200 --> 07:40.160
you are consenting to narrow your range of possible actions. And your boss's behaviors also

07:40.160 --> 07:44.480
overlap with a similar diagram. He is also consenting to narrow his range of possible actions

07:44.480 --> 07:49.360
too. This is what a voluntary exchange is when both parties are being honest, consenting to do

07:49.360 --> 07:53.760
a specific thing at the expense of other possibilities. And the trade-off for that loss

07:53.760 --> 07:58.160
of possibility is that you satisfy each other's desires. Sex works the same way. When you consent

07:58.160 --> 08:02.160
to sex with another person, they're also, presumably, consenting to sex with you. And

08:02.160 --> 08:06.000
additionally, whatever else comes along with that relationship, whether it be casual or serious.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.800
This is why informed consent actually makes sense, at least to some reasonable degree. For example,

08:10.800 --> 08:15.280
if one person is consenting to sex under some preconceived notion of exclusivity and the other

08:15.280 --> 08:20.320
person violates that notion, it absolutely feels like a violation of consent. Just ask anybody

08:20.320 --> 08:24.480
who's been cheated on. But what's important for our discussion is that all of this stuff describes

08:24.480 --> 08:28.560
a non-religious deontological framework. When you enter into a friendship, a romantic relationship,

08:28.560 --> 08:32.320
a business relationship, there are rules for your interactions within that framework, whether

08:32.320 --> 08:37.200
they're explicitly stated or not. When you consent to bind yourself to a series of rules in exchange

08:37.200 --> 08:41.520
for some benefit at the expense of other possible options, you are choosing to operate within a

08:41.520 --> 08:46.560
deontological framework. And then if you violate those rules, even if there's no bad outcome that

08:46.560 --> 08:50.640
a consequentialist could point to, you've still violated the agreement. But this is why your

08:50.640 --> 08:54.720
average consequentialist will never actually consider somebody's word to have any worth.

08:54.720 --> 08:59.120
This is why socialists online will lie to your face if it means that they win. And sometimes

08:59.120 --> 09:03.360
they're dumb enough to tell you that. You call it selling out your principles. I call it fucking

09:03.360 --> 09:12.640
winning. And that's my principle. To win as a socialist, not to lose as a socialist. That's

09:12.640 --> 09:19.440
not my principle. I don't give a fuck about principled failure. Principled failure is worth

09:19.440 --> 09:24.240
dog shit. What is honor to a person who only believes in material conditions, who thinks that

09:24.240 --> 09:29.120
the word of another carries no weight? There's a series of two examples, both related to labor,

09:29.120 --> 09:33.600
that can prove my point here. The first one is workplace safety. Consider a boss who is violating

09:33.600 --> 09:38.000
the safety code in order to cut corners and be a bit more productive at the expense of his workers.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.640
A socialist might appeal to the deontological consideration of the code itself, but when pushed,

09:42.640 --> 09:47.600
they will fall back to the consequentialist answer of actual safety and harm. The safety code exists

09:47.600 --> 09:52.320
to avoid accidents. So even if the boss's corner cutting doesn't result in any accidents this time,

09:52.320 --> 09:56.080
it absolutely could later. And we don't want to normalize that behavior and cause more accidents

09:56.080 --> 10:01.440
down the line. The second example is arriving to work on time. Consider a worker who is routinely

10:01.440 --> 10:05.920
late for a shift. Every dumb twitter commie will say something like, good on you, fight the power,

10:05.920 --> 10:10.240
boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, fuck the man over every possible way you can, steal back from

10:10.240 --> 10:15.360
them, etc. The consequences of this act doesn't affect them but the bosses they hate so much.

10:15.360 --> 10:20.000
And the deontological concern, that you gave your word to be at a specific place and time,

10:20.000 --> 10:24.720
that you gave your consent in exchange for your boss's consent to give you money, in fact,

10:24.800 --> 10:28.640
doesn't actually matter to them. If you can violate consent to get a better deal,

10:28.640 --> 10:33.040
the socialist will advise you to do it because the better deal is a good outcome and consent

10:33.040 --> 10:38.320
is deontological. It is a product of agreements, not outcomes. Understanding that consent works

10:38.320 --> 10:42.960
in this way explains why people on the left have such a hard time with respecting it. And while

10:42.960 --> 10:47.520
I'm certainly being cheeky right now, I don't only mean in the context of sexual assault or

10:47.520 --> 10:52.080
pedophilia. Let's return to employment. A common socialist position is that workers cannot truly

10:52.080 --> 10:56.160
consent to employment because of power imbalances. The workers will die without getting paid and

10:56.160 --> 11:00.720
buying the food they need and so their boss is willing to exploit that need. Because starvation

11:00.720 --> 11:05.520
is a gun to the worker's head, to use the socialist phrasing, no negotiation between workers

11:05.520 --> 11:10.400
and bosses ever actually constitutes consent because workers are always being coerced by bosses.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.320
By the way, this is the point that Vosch's Coconut Island tries to illustrate. The problem with this

11:14.320 --> 11:18.160
view is that it rests atop the idea that two parties who negotiate from different positions

11:18.160 --> 11:22.720
of power can never truly be negotiating because they aren't holding the exact same cards in their

11:22.720 --> 11:27.200
hand. One person will always have a better position and therefore they will always be

11:27.200 --> 11:31.600
exploiting the weaker party and so it's never truly consent. The natural end result of this

11:31.600 --> 11:36.800
view is the complete destruction of the very concept of negotiation since nobody is ever

11:36.800 --> 11:42.160
perfectly equal. And if you were a revolutionary communist who only believed in consequentialist

11:42.160 --> 11:46.960
ethics and was willing to do any number of deontologically bad things to achieve your ideal

11:46.960 --> 11:51.680
end, undermining the concept of negotiation itself by rendering it invalid and therefore

11:51.680 --> 11:56.240
only leaving violence on the table is absolutely something that you would want to do. But what

11:56.240 --> 12:00.960
makes negotiation legitimate is not the relative bargaining strength of the various parties,

12:00.960 --> 12:05.680
it's consent. If you are a person who wants negotiation destroyed, if you don't consider

12:05.680 --> 12:09.520
agreements to be valid because of their deontological nature, then there is absolutely no

12:09.520 --> 12:14.640
way in hell you can actually value consent. There is no consequentialist justification for consent

12:14.640 --> 12:19.360
itself. Only a vague understanding that a society which devalues consent can be a bad

12:19.360 --> 12:24.160
society to live in and if you think that society is somehow good then there is just no reason to

12:24.160 --> 12:29.280
value consent at all. Consent seems to rest atop of some understanding of natural law. If we are

12:29.280 --> 12:33.760
individuals with free will then we can both give consent and be held responsible for our actions.

12:33.760 --> 12:39.040
Marxism as a school of thought entirely rejects this notion. I love going back to this essay,

12:39.040 --> 12:44.640
the title always makes me laugh, but in Marx's On the Jewish Question, he devotes the middle

12:44.640 --> 12:49.760
third of the essay to condemning France's 1789 declaration of the rights of man and of the

12:49.760 --> 12:55.360
citizen for offering up a definition of rights that is too liberal. Here are his criticisms and

12:55.360 --> 12:59.360
bear with me, it will be a little bit long but I want to make the point clear. Above all we note

12:59.360 --> 13:03.280
the fact that the so-called rights of man are nothing but the rights of a member of civil

13:03.280 --> 13:08.320
society, i.e. the rights of egotistic man, of man separated from other men and from the community.

13:08.320 --> 13:13.840
Article two, these rights are equality, liberty, security and property. What constitutes liberty?

13:13.840 --> 13:18.240
Article six, liberty is the power which man has to do everything that does not harm the rights of

13:18.240 --> 13:22.880
others. Liberty therefore is the right to do everything that harms no one else. The limits

13:22.880 --> 13:27.200
within which anyone can act without harming someone else are defined by law just as the

13:27.200 --> 13:31.600
boundary between two fields determined by a post. It is the question of the liberty of man as an

13:31.600 --> 13:36.560
isolated monad withdrawn into himself but the right of man to liberty is based not on the

13:36.560 --> 13:41.280
association of man with man but on the separation of man from man. It is the right of this

13:41.280 --> 13:46.080
separation, the right of the restricted individual, withdrawn into himself. The practical application

13:46.080 --> 13:50.800
of man's right to liberty is man's right to private property. What constitutes man's right to

13:50.800 --> 13:56.640
private property? Article 16, the right of property is that which every citizen has of enjoying and of

13:56.640 --> 14:01.920
disposing at his discretion of his goods and income of the fruits of his labor and industry.

14:01.920 --> 14:06.480
The right of man to private property is, therefore, the right to enjoy one's property

14:06.480 --> 14:10.880
and to dispose of it at one's discretion, without regard to other men, independently of society,

14:10.880 --> 14:15.520
the right of self-interest. This individual liberty and its application form the basis of

14:15.520 --> 14:20.400
civil society. It makes every man see another man not the realization of his own freedom

14:20.400 --> 14:25.520
but the barrier to it. Equality used here in its non-political sense is nothing but the equality

14:25.520 --> 14:30.240
of liberty as described above. Namely each man is to the same extent regarded as such a

14:30.240 --> 14:35.440
self-sufficient monad. In security, Article 8, security consists in the protection afforded

14:35.440 --> 14:39.520
by society to each of its members for the preservation of his person, his rights, and his

14:39.520 --> 14:45.200
property. Security is the highest social concept of civil society, the concept of police, expressing

14:45.200 --> 14:49.520
the fact that the whole of society exists only in order to guarantee to each of its members the

14:49.520 --> 14:54.160
preservation of his person, his rights, and his property. The concept of security does not raise

14:54.160 --> 14:59.680
a civil society above its egoism. On the contrary, security is the insurance of egoism. None of the

14:59.680 --> 15:05.040
so-called rights of man, therefore, go beyond egotistic man, beyond man as a member of civil

15:05.040 --> 15:09.680
society, that is, an individual withdrawn into himself, into the confines of his private interests

15:09.680 --> 15:14.240
and private caprice, and separated from his community. In the rights of man, he is far from

15:14.240 --> 15:19.520
being conceived as a species being. On the contrary, species life itself, society, appears as

15:19.520 --> 15:24.000
a framework external to the individual, as a restriction of their original independence. The

15:24.000 --> 15:28.240
sole bond holding them together is natural necessity, need, and private interest. The

15:28.240 --> 15:32.240
preservation of their property, and their egotistic selves. It is puzzling enough that

15:32.240 --> 15:36.080
a people which is just beginning to liberate itself, to tear down all barriers between its

15:36.080 --> 15:40.240
various sections, and to establish a political community, that such a people solemnly proclaim

15:40.240 --> 15:44.160
the rights of egotistic man separated from his fellow men and from the community. Here's what

15:44.160 --> 15:47.840
Marx said in a lot fewer words. The liberal conception of rights as being a product of

15:47.840 --> 15:52.720
natural law, aka natural rights, is too individualistic. It ignores collective concerns.

15:52.720 --> 15:58.400
This passage forms the Marxist basis for the rejection of rights. It is the right of people

15:58.400 --> 16:02.160
to stand apart, but not the right of people to be brought closer together. One of the biggest

16:02.160 --> 16:06.960
reasons as to why Marx is incredibly stupid, is that the individual does not actually need a right

16:06.960 --> 16:11.600
to be brought closer together, but the individual does need the right to stand apart. If people want

16:11.600 --> 16:16.480
to be closer, they can voluntarily choose to do so. No rights are required for that beyond consent,

16:16.480 --> 16:21.280
but if people do not want to be closer, if they actually want to be disassociated, disconnected,

16:21.280 --> 16:25.760
if in more practical terms they want to be free of an abuser or a rapist or a manipulator,

16:25.760 --> 16:30.560
then in a liberal society they have that right to stand apart. Imagine a Marxist society where the

16:30.560 --> 16:35.520
right to be brought closer together is enshrined. Imagine an abuser having the right to be close to

16:35.520 --> 16:41.040
their victim out of a sense of Marxist illiberal anti-individualism. That is what Marx is saying

16:41.040 --> 16:46.480
when he critiques the liberal idea of rights as an individual withdrawn into himself, into the

16:46.480 --> 16:52.000
confines of his private interests. When he says, the right of man to liberty is based not on the

16:52.000 --> 16:57.600
association of man with man, but on the separation of man from man, his critique is that the liberal

16:57.600 --> 17:03.360
conception of rights does not allow people to be forced together. It is for this reason that

17:03.360 --> 17:10.560
Marxists have never respected consent. Not consent to ownership, not consent to labor, and not sexual

17:10.560 --> 17:16.400
consent. It is in their ideology to actively reject consent as part of liberal egoism,

17:16.400 --> 17:22.000
of bourgeois privacy. Consent is deontological in nature, and deontological ethics are ultimately

17:22.000 --> 17:27.040
just capitalist constructions that the Marxist needs to see torn down, and because to the Marxist

17:27.040 --> 17:32.480
individual concerns are second rate, the consent of the individual is not required within a Marxist

17:32.480 --> 17:36.720
society. At this point in my ethical understanding I'm not a consequentialist or a deontologician,

17:36.720 --> 17:41.120
but a virtue ethicist. Thanks Sargon's reading suggestions for that. Virtue ethics posits that

17:41.120 --> 17:45.920
it's not only good rules or good ends that create goodness, though both of those things play a role,

17:45.920 --> 17:51.200
but it's also good habits. In other words, you are what you consistently do. Cultivating a character

17:51.200 --> 17:57.040
with positive traits, aka virtues, and not with negative traits, aka vices, creates good people.

17:57.040 --> 18:02.240
Moreover, in virtue ethics moral content lies not just in the deliberation of an act, or the

18:02.240 --> 18:06.960
outcome of an act, but in the act itself. Consider saving somebody from a car accident. You may have

18:06.960 --> 18:11.600
a deontological reason to do so, some legal or religious rule to follow. You may understand the

18:11.600 --> 18:16.640
positive outcome of doing so. Somebody is alive afterward. But the action of saving the life

18:16.640 --> 18:22.560
itself also has moral content, because it shows and builds good moral character in your personality.

18:22.560 --> 18:28.880
The bravery, the honor, the self-sacrifice. Consent may be deontological, but it also speaks to virtue.

18:28.880 --> 18:32.880
To consent to do something means, assuming you honor that consent and actually do it,

18:32.880 --> 18:37.200
you're building your character. This is why what you choose to consent to, and not consent to,

18:37.200 --> 18:41.680
is of the utmost importance. And at the same time, you'll also realize that we are far outside of the

18:41.680 --> 18:46.800
socialist framework right now. Socialists don't have proper language within their lens to describe

18:46.800 --> 18:50.960
any of these concepts I'm talking about. They certainly don't practice any of these concepts,

18:50.960 --> 18:54.960
and I think that's why you can pluck any random socialist out of a crowd, and they will probably

18:54.960 --> 18:59.440
be entirely lacking in any sort of virtue. They may pay lip service to the idea of consent,

18:59.440 --> 19:04.480
but they cannot truly understand why it is so vitally important, and what it actually does to

19:04.480 --> 19:08.960
you, and to others, when you give consent and follow through. For all of consequentialism's

19:08.960 --> 19:13.120
good components, and give the devil his due, there are a lot of them, there is no room within

19:13.120 --> 19:18.000
a consequentialist framework for the concept of consent. If you value consent, then you must value

19:18.000 --> 19:22.400
your honor, and you must be able to trust others at their word. This requires some notion of

19:22.400 --> 19:27.440
deontological ethics. If you meet a person who just completely ignores deontological ethics on

19:27.440 --> 19:31.040
principle, you will likely discover that they actually have no principles at all.
