1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,740
Answer? Me. There, I beat you to it.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,640
People throw the word grifter around a lot, so I figured it's probably best to actually

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,620
talk about what it means. From a historical point of view, the root of the word comes

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,820
from graft, which appeared around the 15th century in botanical context. You know, like

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:26,940
grafting plant shoots and such. Through the botanical influence, by the 19th century,

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,520
the maximum amount of soil you could dig up with a shovel or a spade in one scoop was

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,680
known as that tool's graft. And shortly thereafter, the act of digging was known as

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,880
grafting. This later generalized to any kind of hard work.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:46,360
By 1865, graft was considered a slang term for obtaining profit or advantage by dishonest

10
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,460
or shady means, especially bribery, blackmail, or the abuse of a position of power or influence.

11
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:57,160
The shift from honest hard work to dishonest tactics that nonetheless still may require

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,540
hard work to pull off is also attributed to the term's origin in botany. Grafting techniques

13
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,940
of that era often created excrescences in the plants, an excrescence being a distinct

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,780
abnormal outgrowth of a living organism that is malformed or diseased in some way. The

15
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,680
implication is obvious. While a graft may require as much effort as honest work, it

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,320
is not actually honest work. By the turn of the century, grift was considered a diminutive

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,060
form of graft, which is commonly done in the English language by replacing a word's

18
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,240
vowel with the letter I. A grafter was considered to be somebody who engages in political corruption,

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,360
and a grifter was a small-time confidence man or a carnival swindler. And while grafters

20
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,360
usage in this way has fallen out of popularity, mingling with its botanical and hard-working

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,920
variants, grifter has remained to the present day. It currently refers to a person who is

22
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,900
willing to say or do anything to make money, but not in a positive, hard-working context,

23
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,440
but rather in a negative, dishonest context. They have no problems with lying, cheating,

24
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,360
or stealing. They will say things that they explicitly know to be false, or they will

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,040
completely abandon the idea of consistency in their pursuits. To be a grifter, it helps

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
to be a sociopath, but it's not exactly necessary. You just have to know how to manipulate

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,140
people and to make them think they want to give you their money, at least long enough

28
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,640
for them to actually give it to you. Boy, I knew that English degree would pay off one

29
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,080
day. Hit up my subscribe store if you want to help me pay for it. Unless you actually

30
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,620
consider me a grifter, then I guess it's okay. But that's the rub, isn't it? If

31
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,760
I were a real grifter, and as part of the grift I was trying to create a reputation

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,040
based on honesty and voluntary action, I would say things like, here's my donation, Lynx

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,480
guys. You don't have to donate if you can't afford it, though. Who knows if I'm being

34
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,540
compassionate towards my viewers, or I'm just cultivating an image of compassion in

35
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,860
order to get paid without actually meaning it. Who knows what level of the game each

36
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,780
of us are playing at? And the truth is, you can't really know. A perfect grifter will

37
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,000
never let you. Nowadays, if you hang around political YouTube, you'll notice the terms

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,820
grift or grifter tossed around quite a bit. There's a commie channel called The Serfs,

39
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,300
fitting name considering that's where their ideas lead, that really seems to love those

40
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,040
terms. Let's analyze a few examples. It's simultaneously hilarious and rage-inducing

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,860
that anyone threw money at this grift, said in reference to the Lincoln Project, which

42
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,880
is an organization that appeals to the broader left and Democrat voters for donations in

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,480
order to combat Trumpism from a rightist position. They did so by supporting Republicans that

44
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,100
— while they were anti-Trump — were still not Democrats or leftists. Are these people

45
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,780
grifters? I mean, maybe. They did take money from left-leaning sources who were too dumb

46
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,140
to think beyond orange man fascist, and never really made it clear where that money was

47
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,580
going until they started endorsing anti-Trump Republicans. Just a friendly reminder that

48
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,120
the free marketplace of ideas is a complete grift, said in reference to Dave Rubin blocking

49
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,120
them over some Twitter trolling. I don't really know about Dave Rubin being a grifter,

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,420
although Joe Rogan seems to think he is nowadays. Kanye was the wrecking machine, but I actually

51
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,220
think, I think in the grand scheme of things, Candace is much bigger. I really believe that

52
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,220
in terms of —

53
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,220
Why?

54
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,700
Because I think she could be a direct line to all of the political parts of this if she

55
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,940
decides to go that route, because I think she could, I think she could run for Senate

56
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,940
or —

57
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,940
What?

58
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,940
Yeah.

59
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,940
You said you watched the podcast I did with her.

60
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,940
Yeah.

61
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,940
Okay.

62
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,940
Yeah. I watched, I don't know, maybe at least an hour and a half of it or so.

63
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,940
Okay.

64
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,940
Yeah. Why?

65
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,940
Why what?

66
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,760
I don't know. Why are you saying it that way?

67
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,680
I mean, I don't want to name any names, but there's a bunch of people that do it blatantly.

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,840
You see them, and I've even seen them switch teams, and you see them switch teams, and

69
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,680
I don't buy their rationalizations when it comes to ideology. What I think is what they're

70
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,240
doing is they're switching teams because they realize there's an in on this team.

71
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Right.

72
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,040
And they can just say, this is the problem with the team I used to be on, those fucking

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,980
losers, and they're really Benedict Arnold, right? And like, they probably have as much

74
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,620
of an affinity to the ideas of one side as they do the other side. They just go all in

75
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,020
on one side to get acceptance from the group.

76
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,740
Will you go on Joe Rogan's podcast, and will you have Libertarian presidential VP candidate

77
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,640
on your show before the election? Will I go on Rogan's podcast? I asked him, and our PR

78
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:07,300
people asked him about a bajillion times to go on for my book. We did not get a response

79
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,200
as far as I know, so I don't know what happened there. A little weird for me to say that publicly.

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,600
I don't know what happened.

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:20,880
Even if you disagree with the way people feel about so many different things, it doesn't

82
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,280
mean you can't be their friend. It doesn't. And I'm telling you, we got it wrong. Here's

83
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,200
what's important. What's important is whoever that person is, they got to be sincere. Now,

84
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,660
as soon as you feel like someone's a grifter, you got to cast them out. You got to cast

85
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,700
them out, because they got to figure that out on their own, and they got to apologize.

86
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,620
That's cool, man. You got, listen, you can be wrong, but you have to be honest. And if

87
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,700
you're just bullshitting, then I can't hang out with you.

88
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,220
And I got to say, it is kind of funny to see Lance regurgitate a repainted, so much for

89
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,220
the tolerant left style argument. So your platitudes were utterly meaningless and you

90
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,080
were a grift all along, thanks for clearing that up, said in anger out of Andrew Yang

91
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,320
supporting Biden over Bernie. So is making moves out of political pragmatism a grift?

92
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,160
Because that's literally what you and every other breadtuber and nearly every other leftist

93
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,000
ultimately did when you decided you were riding with Biden a few months later. I think it's

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,980
probably funniest to juxtapose these two examples, though. The joy of being a leftist is wearing

95
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,960
your values like a badge instead of a grift in response to Tim Pool's assertion that

96
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,420
some moderates are afraid of speaking about their values publicly due to the far left.

97
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,860
And your woke grift is tired when Paul Joseph Watson talks about the dominant religions

98
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,680
of countries most likely to stone gay people to death. I'm sure you've noticed by now

99
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,180
the obvious, what stands out like a sore thumb when I put these two tweets together. According

100
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,620
to Lance, it's a grift when it's somebody he disagrees with politically, but it's wearing

101
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,660
your values like a badge when it's a fellow lefty. Nowhere in that extended definition

102
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,140
of grifter that I armed you with earlier in the video did I say that its definition

103
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:04,680
is somebody you personally disagree with, and yet that seems to overwhelmingly be the

104
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,880
way that radicals use the term. Most of Joe Rogan's top viewed interviews are grifters.

105
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,520
Now you may disagree with Alex Jones, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson or Steven Crowder,

106
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,640
but are they really grifters? Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson seem to genuinely believe

107
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,220
what they say, even if you might disagree with them. While Alex Jones and Steven Crowder,

108
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,120
on some level, though obviously not entirely, are exaggerating some of what they say for

109
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,640
comedic effect. When people take sponsorships, sell products, or plug their patreons, is

110
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,020
the only criteria for them being a grifter whether or not the accuser agrees with their

111
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,560
point of view? Not if the creator thinks they're telling the truth, not if they actually provide

112
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,880
the good or service they're selling, but is it really all just politics to these people?

113
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,400
Sargon is an excellent example. These accusations are a dime a dozen. Lol, Sargon is such an

114
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,260
unbelievable grifter. Alright, let's see what they're talking about.

115
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:01,240
Joe Biden likens Ted Cruz to Nazi propaganda's gerbils for helping Trump spread big lie about

116
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:08,260
election fraud. That's mad. That's mad. Biden not even in office yet, and he's already calling

117
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:14,180
Trump and his administration Nazis. Trump can't even speak back on the allegation because

118
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,920
they've torn out his tongue. Unreal.

119
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,880
This is genocidal rhetoric. This is terrible. It is awful, awful what the Democrats are

120
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,160
doing right now. And the thing is, with so much power, you would think that they would

121
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,840
have some kind of grace, but instead they've gone into full-on vicious absolutely crush

122
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:41,800
our opponents mode, and that's quite terrifying. And it shows that it is the left that has

123
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,520
been the problem. It is the way that they operate in politics. They are not tolerant.

124
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,840
And the problem with not being tolerant is it means you can't run a democracy.

125
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,620
What is so objectionable about this clip? Okay, you may disagree with what Sargon's

126
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,560
saying. If you think he's wrong, fair enough. But clearly he believes it, and clearly he's

127
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,500
speaking to an audience of people who also believe it. So if he's delivering the product

128
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,380
they're paying for, how is it a grift? This is like a radical Christian saying that an

129
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,900
LGBT YouTube channel, catering specifically to people interested in LGBT ideology, is

130
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,780
a grift for delivering a product they're advertising that people actually want. Here's

131
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,940
a lengthy criticism of Sargon from the now-defunct subreddit of ChapoTraphouse, and it's clear

132
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,980
that they're trying to turn I disagree with Sargon politically into some blanket statement

133
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,060
about his character and his business. This is a man who dropped out of college to scam

134
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,620
people out of a video game Kickstarter and use that money to run a five-year right-wing

135
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,420
grifting project that consists of him shitting on feminists while calling himself a classical

136
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,180
liberal. Not only is this factually inaccurate, Sargon refunded the money and posted the receipts

137
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,620
last I heard, it's also one of the most try-hard things I've ever read. Right up there with

138
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,820
lol I have more subs and views than you, internet clout totally matters you guys. Let's take

139
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,860
this caption, remove all of the personal attacks and statements of political difference, and

140
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,780
see what criticisms actually remain. Nothing he's said ever provided an idea, concept or

141
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:10,580
solution to modern problems. He's never said anything useful besides SJWs bad. He's never

142
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,580
provided a radical idea that can change the world, unlike Ruder Bregman and Richard Wolf

143
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:22,060
on the left, or Jordan Peterson and Andrew Yang on the right. Nothing he's said has provided

144
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,060
valuable discourse, etc, etc. It basically boils down to two points. One, Sargon has

145
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,900
never proposed a solution to the problems he points out, and two, all the problems he

146
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,660
points out are SJWs bad. Even for back when this was written, I don't think this was the case. But

147
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:44,420
nonetheless, if you are legitimately an anti-SJW individual selling anti-SJW content, and your

148
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:50,380
viewers are all anti-SJWs looking for that content, how is this a grift? When a radical calls

149
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,180
somebody who's in the mainstream center, you know, the Liberals, the Conservatives, grifters,

150
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,580
they're generally not saying here is a person lying, cheating, and stealing, saying things

151
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,980
they know to be false, being hypocritical in order to get paid. Instead, they're saying,

152
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,100
here is a person presenting ideas I think are false, and because I'm obviously correct about

153
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,020
everything, they are taking money from people for reasons I don't approve of. Let's swing back to

154
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,780
the serfs for one final chuckle. Anybody who says they're a socialist but isn't comfortable forming

155
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,380
a worker co-op, or is a progressive who extols the virtues of worker rights and refuses to let

156
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:30,460
their workers unionize, is a grifter. Why yes, I do agree, Lance. This is why literally everybody

157
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,260
laughed when Vosch said his business did not have to be a worker co-op, including myself. Check out

158
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,900
my old Eat the Rich video on that topic if you like. Now, I don't believe the serfs are grifters.

159
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,100
They might say a lot of dumb shit all the time, but I actually think they probably believe it.

160
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,900
However, who knows if they're actually living it. In general, if you're a radical, you're also more

161
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,820
likely to be a hypocrite. Yes, the number of male feminists who are forcefully respecting women with

162
00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:00,900
their penis is truly astounding. Yes, the number of cult leaders and mega church pastors who live

163
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:08,260
hedonistic lives seems to be basically 100%. And yes, progressives and neo-socialists who spout

164
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,060
rhetoric about wanting the workers revolution, while exploiting everybody around them as hard

165
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,500
and fast as they can, just seems to be the thing that BreadTube does. This realization was the

166
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,380
center of the most recent debate between Vosch and Destiny, where PhilosophyTube was raking in shit

167
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,060
tons of money online, keeping her income private, when a common lefty line of thought is that the

168
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:33,100
expectation that incomes are kept private is one way that bosses keep workers in line by preventing

169
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,440
them from comparing their pay, all the while encouraging people way less well-off than her

170
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,380
to go on rent strikes and other stuff like this. If it sounds hypocritical, that's because it is.

171
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,380
And Vosch defended her in such a way that he basically revealed himself to be somebody not

172
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,380
interested in truth, or even socialism at all on some level, but only raw power. No, really.

173
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,460
There was so much of that shit that I fucking turned down.

174
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,460
So you've turned, okay, good. And you've turned down, and I for my part have turned down

175
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:29,380
every sponsorship. Why? It's not a part of my aesthetic. I don't want to. Okay, wait, then

176
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,900
don't make those things the same. Don't, don't, wait, wait, don't compare that to me.

177
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,620
Okay. You're on a lower level there. Okay. I intentionally, no, no, no, no, no, hold on,

178
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,260
hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. I intentionally have foregone money that I could use otherwise

179
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,100
because it is in accordance with my principles. Okay. You're not doing it because it doesn't fit

180
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,500
the aesthetic that you sell on your YouTube channel. That comparison to me was insulting

181
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,820
because I don't not take certain sponsorships because of my aesthetic. I do it because of my

182
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,980
principles. Those two things are very different. That's what upset me. Do you understand?

183
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,340
When I said, when I said aesthetic, I suppose you wouldn't buy me saying as a lefty,

184
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,140
I don't like the idea of doing legwork for corporations to advertise products that I

185
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,100
don't give a fuck about, but you would say that's walking back because what I actually believe is

186
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,380
that it's purely an aesthetic flourish and me flushing it out. Now that I realize you've been

187
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,660
made upset by my language is the thing is, is what I would say is I wouldn't believe you. I don't

188
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,100
believe that. I don't buy that. Okay. I know, I know you don't because you've assigned me so

189
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,140
little charitability. No, it's because the first response is the most likely to be honest. And this,

190
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,420
there are plenty of like higher order things that could be fucking with our ability to understand.

191
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,940
Yes, that's true. Right. Okay. So if you acknowledge that and you're a moral

192
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,420
anti-realist, so there is actually no choice of the matter, which theory of truth is right.

193
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,420
Then you also acknowledge that any empirical statement I make is also arbitrary.

194
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,940
I mean, I think it would be arbitrary in so far as we would have to disagree on like the meaning

195
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,620
of truth, but I think that most people have subscribed to the idea that truth means something

196
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,780
that could be empirically verified. If a person disagreed with that, I would have to kill them.

197
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,780
There's no truth that there nothing is objective. Nothing is true. Or it's all relative to what

198
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,700
someone wants. Yeah. Everything. But I do think you can make an empirical statement about the

199
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,500
world. Well, that depends on you. Wait, yes. The morality of the Holocaust depends on your

200
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,820
subjective- No, not morality, whether it happened. Oh, whether it happened? Sure. If you have a

201
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,820
different definition of truth, then yeah. But if a person- And you can't say that they're wrong,

202
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,300
they're just- Oh no. Well, I don't have to say that they're wrong. All I have to do is convince

203
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,940
them. Well, right now you are basically saying that. I would disagree with them. I would try

204
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,900
to convince them off that point. Yeah, you would disagree with them, but you have to acknowledge

205
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,620
from this, you know- Yes, I acknowledge that. I've always acknowledged that. Yeah, it's about

206
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,940
power. So you're in a state of complete nihilism about the world. No one's position is more

207
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,300
justified than another. No, I care about things. Inherently, no. Correct. Wow. Okay. So you're

208
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,660
literally incomplete. So actually right now, if I wanted to, I could flip a coin and if it lands

209
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,460
heads or tails, I'm correct about this issue. And you have no way to refute what I just said.

210
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,420
Empirically, no. But I could argue that that's dumb. Wow. Well, it doesn't matter. I mean,

211
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,020
if you just acknowledge all you do is just scream at people to make you feel good. Wait, yeah,

212
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,100
wait, wait. No, I don't, wait. I don't scream at people. So you don't care about truth in the

213
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,020
world, I guess. Wait. Yeah, I do. I care about my truth in the world. Yeah. You care about how you

214
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,220
feel. Yeah. Yes. Because all moral positions are downstream of our subjective emotional preferences.

215
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,340
How many times do I have to refrain this? No, no. It's just, it's crazy to me hearing you say it.

216
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:36,340
Like two plus two equals four, right? There are multiple theories of truth. Something can be true

217
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,900
because it's actually existing in the world, right? Which is probably what you view truth as.

218
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:46,580
You know, the cup is red is true if it is actually, okay. There's another theory of truth. It could be

219
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:52,260
something is true if and only if it makes me feel good, right? My question to you would then be,

220
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,900
well, which of those theories of truth should I adopt? It depends on which moral system you

221
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,500
subscribe to. If you subscribe to a different one and that causes me harm, I could just like

222
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,540
kill you. So you acknowledge that theories of truth are moral statements. All of thought is

223
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,020
just power grabs between people who can decide subjectively whether or not their positions are

224
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,940
better than others. That is all power grabs. Unironically. Wow. In some cases. The truth of

225
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:22,340
whether the Holocaust happened, a power grab. Yes. And this. The thing on like mob rule,

226
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,020
I don't believe, I can't believe that you think that. There's no way that you do. Do you not feel

227
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:31,220
I've applied a consistent standard where I think it's more moral to just submit yourself to the mob

228
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,540
than it is to just kill everyone who comes for you? If I submitted a consistent standard,

229
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,700
I don't think it's fair for you to accuse me of being in bad faith. It is consistent. Maybe that's

230
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,060
how people feel when they argue against me and I'm consistent in something. Maybe you genuinely do

231
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,220
believe that. I guess it's possible, but I'll be super serious in the future. Cause I, cause I can

232
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,700
think of a lot of scenarios that are really sweats to me where fucking black dudes have been lynched

233
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,700
by white people thinking they were in the right where saying that like, well, well, but then you

234
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,740
even said that earlier, maybe the black guy should just submit himself to get arrested and then they

235
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,820
can hash out a court. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If people are coming to arrest the

236
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,420
black guy, then yeah, I think that he should submit to arrest rather than gunning down a bunch

237
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,820
of unarmed white people. Not to submit to arrest, but like a mob of white people approaching him.

238
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:17,940
It really depends on the context there and how legitimate the lethal threat is. And this. Let's

239
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:25,940
say that there are 10 people. Okay. They're gathered on the beach. And unfortunately today

240
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,940
there is a lost soul. Okay. He's a hundred meters out. This guy is fucked. And none of the people

241
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,420
on the beach, they're not good enough swimmers to go get him. Okay. Now let's say another guy

242
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:42,900
walks by. Okay. This guy is called Chad marks. Okay. Some people call him Charles marks. Okay.

243
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:48,740
This guy is a fucking state champion swimmer and he walks by and he sees that kid out there.

244
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:56,500
Do you think that that guy with his additional means with all that he has available to him,

245
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,780
do you think that it would be just as morally neutral for him to stand by and watch that person

246
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,820
drown as the other 10 less capable people on that beach? Could he simply say, I mean, I don't have

247
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,260
like an obligation, but that would be good if I did, but like, I mean, I could just sit here and

248
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,300
watch it happen. I don't think it's bad. It's just morally neutral. If I sit here and watch him,

249
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:21,300
if he has the means otherwise, I should go out and save the person. Okay. Why is that dis analogous?

250
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:29,060
Okay. Because if that they decided not to do that thing, if they decided to abstain,

251
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,940
it would cost a person their life. Whereas in the case of a lefty opening a business,

252
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,540
their decision to open, it would not add any negative utility to the world.

253
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,180
So in that case, we're, we're talking about for a lefty, it's either you abstain and you have

254
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:52,100
nothing or you participate and you have nothing assuming you don't do extra battery. Okay. That's

255
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:59,140
not really material to the swimmer. If they abstain, you have a death. And if they participate,

256
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:05,540
you have that's not at all material to the participation and abstinence in these two

257
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:11,860
examples met very different outcomes. Well, participation in a morally righteous way,

258
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,020
and the swimming one could result in saving somebody's life participation in a righteous

259
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,660
way. And the economic sense could be you opening a business that improves the material conditions of

260
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,020
multiple other workers and families. I think those are comfortable. I think that'd be great.

261
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:29,940
Okay. Abstinence in one sense is you just stand by and you watch a person drown an abstinence,

262
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,620
which is negative and abstinence. And the business sense is you just stand by and you

263
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,660
watch another business open up and exploit workers, which would be neutral, but the death

264
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:44,100
is negative. How is that? Okay. I never, ever, ever want you to say again that like capitalism

265
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,420
is negative or business owners are bad because you understand my argument enough. I guess not

266
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,260
because you've bit the neutral bullet on basically every single actor in a capitalist system.

267
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,660
I I'm sorry. If there's some irreconcilable difference that we're not going to resolve here,

268
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:02,500
then we might as well not waste an additional hour on it. If you acknowledge that when a lefty opens

269
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,140
a business and let's say pays market rates, same as everyone else, and the workers are treated

270
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,260
fine, really middle of the road, as hard as that is to abstract, all you are doing in a purely

271
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:18,580
empirical sense is giving local workers an additional choice, an additional place that

272
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,740
they could sell their labor to an unethical institution, unfortunate, but you are not

273
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:31,140
compelling or mandating or directing any direct harm. If you didn't do that, there would be no

274
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,260
benefit. But if you have the means to know, if you have the means to act in a way that's in

275
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,140
more accordance in more, no, if you have the means to act in harmony with your principles,

276
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:50,420
then for you to do less, I genuinely think that your perspective on this issue has been tainted

277
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,980
or corroded in some way by the people that you've argued on. If it's been tainted or corroded by

278
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,460
anything, it's by the fact that I went to a Jesuit high school and what a part of what we taught,

279
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,620
I guess, was like that you should live your principles.

280
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,380
If you still have any delusions about whether or not Vash believes what he's saying, or really any

281
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,580
other breadtuber who parrots his rhetoric, I hope this puts them to bed. This is what a grifter

282
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,940
actually is. When you openly, nakedly say that truth does not exist beyond what you can twist

283
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,180
people into believing, that winning is more important than being correct, that the appearance

284
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,300
of being anti-corporate is more important than living your principles, there is no more clear

285
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,700
example of a grifter than that. The problem with the grifter worldview that Vash espouses

286
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:37,940
is that eventually reality will snap back. It does not matter how many laborers or scientists

287
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:44,580
or engineers that Soviet commissar Vash browbeats into submission, if you don't adhere to objective

288
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,220
real-world truth at some point, you're gonna get Chernobyl out of your nuclear program.

289
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,460
You can scream that two plus two doesn't equal four as much as you want, but the mushroom cloud

290
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,540
forming over the ruins of your project does not care. And while that is an extreme comparison,

291
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,860
this sort of thing happens all the time when you ignore the truth. What happened to Ethan Ralph,

292
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:06,660
Andy Warsky, Mr. Medicker, Channel Awesome, Game Grumps, or any other YouTube channel or

293
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,540
online personality that ignored the truth in favor of grifting, hoping their popularity would allow

294
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:16,660
them to skate on by? They're all shadows of their former selves, and that will be where Vash finds

295
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,700
himself sooner or later. The reason grifters have to keep leaving town eventually and move on,

296
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,420
is because the people they swindle inevitably catch up to them. The act of grifting makes

297
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,220
enemies of your own audience, the very people that pay you. You can't run away from that forever.

298
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,180
The clapback will come for Vash and the rest of BreadTube in due time. And just like it did with

299
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,500
Ralph, with Warsky, Medicker, Channel Awesome, and Game Grumps, I will be here with a bucket of

300
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,420
popcorn, laughing my ass off about it. Thank you for watching my friends. If you enjoyed this

301
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:51,300

00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,340
engagement metrics like, I don't know. Sub for more, or hit up my Patreon or Subscribe star if

303
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,100
you want to keep it coming. And be sure to stick around, because I'm putting up a new video every

304
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,060
single day. So, I'll see you tomorrow. I love you.
