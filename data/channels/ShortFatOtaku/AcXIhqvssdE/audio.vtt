00:00.000 --> 00:08.740
Answer? Me. There, I beat you to it.

00:08.740 --> 00:12.640
People throw the word grifter around a lot, so I figured it's probably best to actually

00:12.640 --> 00:16.620
talk about what it means. From a historical point of view, the root of the word comes

00:16.620 --> 00:21.820
from graft, which appeared around the 15th century in botanical context. You know, like

00:21.820 --> 00:26.940
grafting plant shoots and such. Through the botanical influence, by the 19th century,

00:26.940 --> 00:31.520
the maximum amount of soil you could dig up with a shovel or a spade in one scoop was

00:31.520 --> 00:36.680
known as that tool's graft. And shortly thereafter, the act of digging was known as

00:36.680 --> 00:39.880
grafting. This later generalized to any kind of hard work.

00:39.880 --> 00:46.360
By 1865, graft was considered a slang term for obtaining profit or advantage by dishonest

00:46.360 --> 00:52.460
or shady means, especially bribery, blackmail, or the abuse of a position of power or influence.

00:52.460 --> 00:57.160
The shift from honest hard work to dishonest tactics that nonetheless still may require

00:57.160 --> 01:02.540
hard work to pull off is also attributed to the term's origin in botany. Grafting techniques

01:02.540 --> 01:07.940
of that era often created excrescences in the plants, an excrescence being a distinct

01:07.940 --> 01:12.780
abnormal outgrowth of a living organism that is malformed or diseased in some way. The

01:12.780 --> 01:17.680
implication is obvious. While a graft may require as much effort as honest work, it

01:17.680 --> 01:22.320
is not actually honest work. By the turn of the century, grift was considered a diminutive

01:22.320 --> 01:27.060
form of graft, which is commonly done in the English language by replacing a word's

01:27.060 --> 01:32.240
vowel with the letter I. A grafter was considered to be somebody who engages in political corruption,

01:32.240 --> 01:37.360
and a grifter was a small-time confidence man or a carnival swindler. And while grafters

01:37.360 --> 01:42.360
usage in this way has fallen out of popularity, mingling with its botanical and hard-working

01:42.360 --> 01:46.920
variants, grifter has remained to the present day. It currently refers to a person who is

01:46.920 --> 01:51.900
willing to say or do anything to make money, but not in a positive, hard-working context,

01:51.940 --> 01:56.440
but rather in a negative, dishonest context. They have no problems with lying, cheating,

01:56.440 --> 02:00.360
or stealing. They will say things that they explicitly know to be false, or they will

02:00.360 --> 02:05.040
completely abandon the idea of consistency in their pursuits. To be a grifter, it helps

02:05.040 --> 02:09.200
to be a sociopath, but it's not exactly necessary. You just have to know how to manipulate

02:09.200 --> 02:13.140
people and to make them think they want to give you their money, at least long enough

02:13.140 --> 02:16.640
for them to actually give it to you. Boy, I knew that English degree would pay off one

02:16.640 --> 02:20.080
day. Hit up my subscribe store if you want to help me pay for it. Unless you actually

02:20.080 --> 02:23.620
consider me a grifter, then I guess it's okay. But that's the rub, isn't it? If

02:23.620 --> 02:27.760
I were a real grifter, and as part of the grift I was trying to create a reputation

02:27.760 --> 02:33.040
based on honesty and voluntary action, I would say things like, here's my donation, Lynx

02:33.040 --> 02:36.480
guys. You don't have to donate if you can't afford it, though. Who knows if I'm being

02:36.480 --> 02:40.540
compassionate towards my viewers, or I'm just cultivating an image of compassion in

02:40.540 --> 02:43.860
order to get paid without actually meaning it. Who knows what level of the game each

02:43.860 --> 02:47.780
of us are playing at? And the truth is, you can't really know. A perfect grifter will

02:47.780 --> 02:52.000
never let you. Nowadays, if you hang around political YouTube, you'll notice the terms

02:52.000 --> 02:56.820
grift or grifter tossed around quite a bit. There's a commie channel called The Serfs,

02:56.820 --> 03:00.300
fitting name considering that's where their ideas lead, that really seems to love those

03:00.300 --> 03:05.040
terms. Let's analyze a few examples. It's simultaneously hilarious and rage-inducing

03:05.040 --> 03:08.860
that anyone threw money at this grift, said in reference to the Lincoln Project, which

03:08.860 --> 03:12.880
is an organization that appeals to the broader left and Democrat voters for donations in

03:12.880 --> 03:17.480
order to combat Trumpism from a rightist position. They did so by supporting Republicans that

03:17.480 --> 03:23.100
— while they were anti-Trump — were still not Democrats or leftists. Are these people

03:23.100 --> 03:27.780
grifters? I mean, maybe. They did take money from left-leaning sources who were too dumb

03:27.780 --> 03:32.140
to think beyond orange man fascist, and never really made it clear where that money was

03:32.140 --> 03:36.580
going until they started endorsing anti-Trump Republicans. Just a friendly reminder that

03:36.580 --> 03:41.120
the free marketplace of ideas is a complete grift, said in reference to Dave Rubin blocking

03:41.120 --> 03:45.120
them over some Twitter trolling. I don't really know about Dave Rubin being a grifter,

03:45.120 --> 03:49.420
although Joe Rogan seems to think he is nowadays. Kanye was the wrecking machine, but I actually

03:49.420 --> 03:54.220
think, I think in the grand scheme of things, Candace is much bigger. I really believe that

03:54.220 --> 03:55.220
in terms of —

03:55.220 --> 03:56.220
Why?

03:56.220 --> 03:59.700
Because I think she could be a direct line to all of the political parts of this if she

03:59.700 --> 04:03.940
decides to go that route, because I think she could, I think she could run for Senate

04:03.940 --> 04:04.940
or —

04:04.940 --> 04:05.940
What?

04:05.940 --> 04:06.940
Yeah.

04:06.940 --> 04:07.940
You said you watched the podcast I did with her.

04:07.940 --> 04:08.940
Yeah.

04:08.940 --> 04:09.940
Okay.

04:09.940 --> 04:10.940
Yeah. I watched, I don't know, maybe at least an hour and a half of it or so.

04:10.940 --> 04:11.940
Okay.

04:11.940 --> 04:12.940
Yeah. Why?

04:12.940 --> 04:13.940
Why what?

04:14.760 --> 04:16.760
I don't know. Why are you saying it that way?

04:19.760 --> 04:23.680
I mean, I don't want to name any names, but there's a bunch of people that do it blatantly.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.840
You see them, and I've even seen them switch teams, and you see them switch teams, and

04:27.840 --> 04:31.680
I don't buy their rationalizations when it comes to ideology. What I think is what they're

04:31.680 --> 04:35.240
doing is they're switching teams because they realize there's an in on this team.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.240
Right.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.040
And they can just say, this is the problem with the team I used to be on, those fucking

04:39.040 --> 04:44.980
losers, and they're really Benedict Arnold, right? And like, they probably have as much

04:44.980 --> 04:49.620
of an affinity to the ideas of one side as they do the other side. They just go all in

04:49.620 --> 04:52.020
on one side to get acceptance from the group.

04:52.020 --> 04:56.740
Will you go on Joe Rogan's podcast, and will you have Libertarian presidential VP candidate

04:56.740 --> 05:01.640
on your show before the election? Will I go on Rogan's podcast? I asked him, and our PR

05:01.640 --> 05:07.300
people asked him about a bajillion times to go on for my book. We did not get a response

05:07.300 --> 05:12.200
as far as I know, so I don't know what happened there. A little weird for me to say that publicly.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.600
I don't know what happened.

05:14.600 --> 05:20.880
Even if you disagree with the way people feel about so many different things, it doesn't

05:20.880 --> 05:26.280
mean you can't be their friend. It doesn't. And I'm telling you, we got it wrong. Here's

05:26.280 --> 05:32.200
what's important. What's important is whoever that person is, they got to be sincere. Now,

05:32.200 --> 05:37.660
as soon as you feel like someone's a grifter, you got to cast them out. You got to cast

05:37.660 --> 05:41.700
them out, because they got to figure that out on their own, and they got to apologize.

05:41.700 --> 05:46.620
That's cool, man. You got, listen, you can be wrong, but you have to be honest. And if

05:46.620 --> 05:49.700
you're just bullshitting, then I can't hang out with you.

05:49.700 --> 05:54.220
And I got to say, it is kind of funny to see Lance regurgitate a repainted, so much for

05:54.220 --> 05:58.220
the tolerant left style argument. So your platitudes were utterly meaningless and you

05:58.220 --> 06:03.080
were a grift all along, thanks for clearing that up, said in anger out of Andrew Yang

06:03.080 --> 06:09.320
supporting Biden over Bernie. So is making moves out of political pragmatism a grift?

06:09.320 --> 06:14.160
Because that's literally what you and every other breadtuber and nearly every other leftist

06:14.160 --> 06:18.000
ultimately did when you decided you were riding with Biden a few months later. I think it's

06:18.000 --> 06:22.980
probably funniest to juxtapose these two examples, though. The joy of being a leftist is wearing

06:22.980 --> 06:26.960
your values like a badge instead of a grift in response to Tim Pool's assertion that

06:26.960 --> 06:31.420
some moderates are afraid of speaking about their values publicly due to the far left.

06:31.420 --> 06:36.860
And your woke grift is tired when Paul Joseph Watson talks about the dominant religions

06:36.860 --> 06:41.680
of countries most likely to stone gay people to death. I'm sure you've noticed by now

06:41.680 --> 06:46.180
the obvious, what stands out like a sore thumb when I put these two tweets together. According

06:46.180 --> 06:50.620
to Lance, it's a grift when it's somebody he disagrees with politically, but it's wearing

06:50.620 --> 06:54.660
your values like a badge when it's a fellow lefty. Nowhere in that extended definition

06:54.660 --> 06:59.140
of grifter that I armed you with earlier in the video did I say that its definition

06:59.140 --> 07:04.680
is somebody you personally disagree with, and yet that seems to overwhelmingly be the

07:04.680 --> 07:09.880
way that radicals use the term. Most of Joe Rogan's top viewed interviews are grifters.

07:09.880 --> 07:14.520
Now you may disagree with Alex Jones, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson or Steven Crowder,

07:14.520 --> 07:18.640
but are they really grifters? Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson seem to genuinely believe

07:18.640 --> 07:23.220
what they say, even if you might disagree with them. While Alex Jones and Steven Crowder,

07:23.220 --> 07:27.120
on some level, though obviously not entirely, are exaggerating some of what they say for

07:27.120 --> 07:32.640
comedic effect. When people take sponsorships, sell products, or plug their patreons, is

07:32.640 --> 07:37.020
the only criteria for them being a grifter whether or not the accuser agrees with their

07:37.020 --> 07:41.560
point of view? Not if the creator thinks they're telling the truth, not if they actually provide

07:41.560 --> 07:46.880
the good or service they're selling, but is it really all just politics to these people?

07:46.880 --> 07:51.400
Sargon is an excellent example. These accusations are a dime a dozen. Lol, Sargon is such an

07:51.400 --> 07:55.260
unbelievable grifter. Alright, let's see what they're talking about.

07:55.260 --> 08:01.240
Joe Biden likens Ted Cruz to Nazi propaganda's gerbils for helping Trump spread big lie about

08:01.240 --> 08:08.260
election fraud. That's mad. That's mad. Biden not even in office yet, and he's already calling

08:08.260 --> 08:14.180
Trump and his administration Nazis. Trump can't even speak back on the allegation because

08:14.180 --> 08:17.920
they've torn out his tongue. Unreal.

08:17.920 --> 08:23.880
This is genocidal rhetoric. This is terrible. It is awful, awful what the Democrats are

08:23.880 --> 08:28.160
doing right now. And the thing is, with so much power, you would think that they would

08:28.160 --> 08:34.840
have some kind of grace, but instead they've gone into full-on vicious absolutely crush

08:34.840 --> 08:41.800
our opponents mode, and that's quite terrifying. And it shows that it is the left that has

08:41.800 --> 08:47.520
been the problem. It is the way that they operate in politics. They are not tolerant.

08:47.520 --> 08:51.840
And the problem with not being tolerant is it means you can't run a democracy.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.620
What is so objectionable about this clip? Okay, you may disagree with what Sargon's

08:55.620 --> 09:00.560
saying. If you think he's wrong, fair enough. But clearly he believes it, and clearly he's

09:00.560 --> 09:04.500
speaking to an audience of people who also believe it. So if he's delivering the product

09:04.500 --> 09:08.380
they're paying for, how is it a grift? This is like a radical Christian saying that an

09:08.380 --> 09:13.900
LGBT YouTube channel, catering specifically to people interested in LGBT ideology, is

09:13.900 --> 09:17.780
a grift for delivering a product they're advertising that people actually want. Here's

09:17.780 --> 09:22.940
a lengthy criticism of Sargon from the now-defunct subreddit of ChapoTraphouse, and it's clear

09:22.940 --> 09:27.980
that they're trying to turn I disagree with Sargon politically into some blanket statement

09:27.980 --> 09:32.060
about his character and his business. This is a man who dropped out of college to scam

09:32.060 --> 09:36.620
people out of a video game Kickstarter and use that money to run a five-year right-wing

09:36.620 --> 09:41.420
grifting project that consists of him shitting on feminists while calling himself a classical

09:41.420 --> 09:46.180
liberal. Not only is this factually inaccurate, Sargon refunded the money and posted the receipts

09:46.180 --> 09:50.620
last I heard, it's also one of the most try-hard things I've ever read. Right up there with

09:50.620 --> 09:55.820
lol I have more subs and views than you, internet clout totally matters you guys. Let's take

09:55.820 --> 09:59.860
this caption, remove all of the personal attacks and statements of political difference, and

09:59.860 --> 10:04.780
see what criticisms actually remain. Nothing he's said ever provided an idea, concept or

10:04.780 --> 10:10.580
solution to modern problems. He's never said anything useful besides SJWs bad. He's never

10:10.580 --> 10:15.580
provided a radical idea that can change the world, unlike Ruder Bregman and Richard Wolf

10:15.580 --> 10:22.060
on the left, or Jordan Peterson and Andrew Yang on the right. Nothing he's said has provided

10:22.060 --> 10:28.060
valuable discourse, etc, etc. It basically boils down to two points. One, Sargon has

10:28.060 --> 10:31.900
never proposed a solution to the problems he points out, and two, all the problems he

10:31.900 --> 10:37.660
points out are SJWs bad. Even for back when this was written, I don't think this was the case. But

10:37.660 --> 10:44.420
nonetheless, if you are legitimately an anti-SJW individual selling anti-SJW content, and your

10:44.420 --> 10:50.380
viewers are all anti-SJWs looking for that content, how is this a grift? When a radical calls

10:50.380 --> 10:55.180
somebody who's in the mainstream center, you know, the Liberals, the Conservatives, grifters,

10:55.180 --> 11:00.580
they're generally not saying here is a person lying, cheating, and stealing, saying things

11:00.660 --> 11:04.980
they know to be false, being hypocritical in order to get paid. Instead, they're saying,

11:04.980 --> 11:10.100
here is a person presenting ideas I think are false, and because I'm obviously correct about

11:10.100 --> 11:15.020
everything, they are taking money from people for reasons I don't approve of. Let's swing back to

11:15.020 --> 11:19.780
the serfs for one final chuckle. Anybody who says they're a socialist but isn't comfortable forming

11:19.780 --> 11:24.380
a worker co-op, or is a progressive who extols the virtues of worker rights and refuses to let

11:24.380 --> 11:30.460
their workers unionize, is a grifter. Why yes, I do agree, Lance. This is why literally everybody

11:30.500 --> 11:36.260
laughed when Vosch said his business did not have to be a worker co-op, including myself. Check out

11:36.260 --> 11:40.900
my old Eat the Rich video on that topic if you like. Now, I don't believe the serfs are grifters.

11:40.900 --> 11:45.100
They might say a lot of dumb shit all the time, but I actually think they probably believe it.

11:45.100 --> 11:49.900
However, who knows if they're actually living it. In general, if you're a radical, you're also more

11:49.900 --> 11:54.820
likely to be a hypocrite. Yes, the number of male feminists who are forcefully respecting women with

11:54.820 --> 12:00.900
their penis is truly astounding. Yes, the number of cult leaders and mega church pastors who live

12:00.900 --> 12:08.260
hedonistic lives seems to be basically 100%. And yes, progressives and neo-socialists who spout

12:08.260 --> 12:13.060
rhetoric about wanting the workers revolution, while exploiting everybody around them as hard

12:13.060 --> 12:18.500
and fast as they can, just seems to be the thing that BreadTube does. This realization was the

12:18.500 --> 12:23.380
center of the most recent debate between Vosch and Destiny, where PhilosophyTube was raking in shit

12:23.380 --> 12:28.060
tons of money online, keeping her income private, when a common lefty line of thought is that the

12:28.060 --> 12:33.100
expectation that incomes are kept private is one way that bosses keep workers in line by preventing

12:33.100 --> 12:37.440
them from comparing their pay, all the while encouraging people way less well-off than her

12:37.440 --> 12:42.380
to go on rent strikes and other stuff like this. If it sounds hypocritical, that's because it is.

12:42.380 --> 12:47.380
And Vosch defended her in such a way that he basically revealed himself to be somebody not

12:47.380 --> 12:53.380
interested in truth, or even socialism at all on some level, but only raw power. No, really.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.460
There was so much of that shit that I fucking turned down.

13:19.460 --> 13:23.460
So you've turned, okay, good. And you've turned down, and I for my part have turned down

13:23.460 --> 13:29.380
every sponsorship. Why? It's not a part of my aesthetic. I don't want to. Okay, wait, then

13:30.900 --> 13:34.900
don't make those things the same. Don't, don't, wait, wait, don't compare that to me.

13:34.900 --> 13:39.620
Okay. You're on a lower level there. Okay. I intentionally, no, no, no, no, no, hold on,

13:39.620 --> 13:44.260
hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. I intentionally have foregone money that I could use otherwise

13:44.260 --> 13:48.100
because it is in accordance with my principles. Okay. You're not doing it because it doesn't fit

13:48.100 --> 13:52.500
the aesthetic that you sell on your YouTube channel. That comparison to me was insulting

13:52.500 --> 13:56.820
because I don't not take certain sponsorships because of my aesthetic. I do it because of my

13:56.820 --> 14:00.980
principles. Those two things are very different. That's what upset me. Do you understand?

14:00.980 --> 14:06.340
When I said, when I said aesthetic, I suppose you wouldn't buy me saying as a lefty,

14:06.340 --> 14:11.140
I don't like the idea of doing legwork for corporations to advertise products that I

14:11.140 --> 14:16.100
don't give a fuck about, but you would say that's walking back because what I actually believe is

14:16.100 --> 14:21.380
that it's purely an aesthetic flourish and me flushing it out. Now that I realize you've been

14:21.380 --> 14:26.660
made upset by my language is the thing is, is what I would say is I wouldn't believe you. I don't

14:26.660 --> 14:30.100
believe that. I don't buy that. Okay. I know, I know you don't because you've assigned me so

14:30.100 --> 14:35.140
little charitability. No, it's because the first response is the most likely to be honest. And this,

14:35.140 --> 14:38.420
there are plenty of like higher order things that could be fucking with our ability to understand.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.940
Yes, that's true. Right. Okay. So if you acknowledge that and you're a moral

14:41.940 --> 14:46.420
anti-realist, so there is actually no choice of the matter, which theory of truth is right.

14:46.420 --> 14:50.420
Then you also acknowledge that any empirical statement I make is also arbitrary.

14:51.460 --> 14:55.940
I mean, I think it would be arbitrary in so far as we would have to disagree on like the meaning

14:55.940 --> 14:59.620
of truth, but I think that most people have subscribed to the idea that truth means something

14:59.620 --> 15:03.780
that could be empirically verified. If a person disagreed with that, I would have to kill them.

15:03.780 --> 15:07.780
There's no truth that there nothing is objective. Nothing is true. Or it's all relative to what

15:07.780 --> 15:11.700
someone wants. Yeah. Everything. But I do think you can make an empirical statement about the

15:11.700 --> 15:16.500
world. Well, that depends on you. Wait, yes. The morality of the Holocaust depends on your

15:16.500 --> 15:20.820
subjective- No, not morality, whether it happened. Oh, whether it happened? Sure. If you have a

15:20.820 --> 15:24.820
different definition of truth, then yeah. But if a person- And you can't say that they're wrong,

15:24.820 --> 15:29.300
they're just- Oh no. Well, I don't have to say that they're wrong. All I have to do is convince

15:29.300 --> 15:33.940
them. Well, right now you are basically saying that. I would disagree with them. I would try

15:33.940 --> 15:36.900
to convince them off that point. Yeah, you would disagree with them, but you have to acknowledge

15:36.900 --> 15:41.620
from this, you know- Yes, I acknowledge that. I've always acknowledged that. Yeah, it's about

15:41.620 --> 15:47.940
power. So you're in a state of complete nihilism about the world. No one's position is more

15:47.940 --> 15:53.300
justified than another. No, I care about things. Inherently, no. Correct. Wow. Okay. So you're

15:53.300 --> 15:58.660
literally incomplete. So actually right now, if I wanted to, I could flip a coin and if it lands

15:58.660 --> 16:03.460
heads or tails, I'm correct about this issue. And you have no way to refute what I just said.

16:03.460 --> 16:08.420
Empirically, no. But I could argue that that's dumb. Wow. Well, it doesn't matter. I mean,

16:08.420 --> 16:12.020
if you just acknowledge all you do is just scream at people to make you feel good. Wait, yeah,

16:12.020 --> 16:16.100
wait, wait. No, I don't, wait. I don't scream at people. So you don't care about truth in the

16:16.100 --> 16:20.020
world, I guess. Wait. Yeah, I do. I care about my truth in the world. Yeah. You care about how you

16:20.020 --> 16:25.220
feel. Yeah. Yes. Because all moral positions are downstream of our subjective emotional preferences.

16:25.220 --> 16:30.340
How many times do I have to refrain this? No, no. It's just, it's crazy to me hearing you say it.

16:30.340 --> 16:36.340
Like two plus two equals four, right? There are multiple theories of truth. Something can be true

16:36.340 --> 16:40.900
because it's actually existing in the world, right? Which is probably what you view truth as.

16:40.900 --> 16:46.580
You know, the cup is red is true if it is actually, okay. There's another theory of truth. It could be

16:46.580 --> 16:52.260
something is true if and only if it makes me feel good, right? My question to you would then be,

16:52.260 --> 16:56.900
well, which of those theories of truth should I adopt? It depends on which moral system you

16:56.900 --> 17:00.500
subscribe to. If you subscribe to a different one and that causes me harm, I could just like

17:00.500 --> 17:05.540
kill you. So you acknowledge that theories of truth are moral statements. All of thought is

17:05.540 --> 17:10.020
just power grabs between people who can decide subjectively whether or not their positions are

17:10.020 --> 17:15.940
better than others. That is all power grabs. Unironically. Wow. In some cases. The truth of

17:15.940 --> 17:22.340
whether the Holocaust happened, a power grab. Yes. And this. The thing on like mob rule,

17:22.340 --> 17:26.020
I don't believe, I can't believe that you think that. There's no way that you do. Do you not feel

17:26.020 --> 17:31.220
I've applied a consistent standard where I think it's more moral to just submit yourself to the mob

17:31.220 --> 17:37.540
than it is to just kill everyone who comes for you? If I submitted a consistent standard,

17:37.540 --> 17:41.700
I don't think it's fair for you to accuse me of being in bad faith. It is consistent. Maybe that's

17:41.700 --> 17:45.060
how people feel when they argue against me and I'm consistent in something. Maybe you genuinely do

17:45.060 --> 17:49.220
believe that. I guess it's possible, but I'll be super serious in the future. Cause I, cause I can

17:49.220 --> 17:53.700
think of a lot of scenarios that are really sweats to me where fucking black dudes have been lynched

17:53.700 --> 17:57.700
by white people thinking they were in the right where saying that like, well, well, but then you

17:57.700 --> 18:00.740
even said that earlier, maybe the black guy should just submit himself to get arrested and then they

18:00.740 --> 18:04.820
can hash out a court. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If people are coming to arrest the

18:04.820 --> 18:08.420
black guy, then yeah, I think that he should submit to arrest rather than gunning down a bunch

18:08.420 --> 18:12.820
of unarmed white people. Not to submit to arrest, but like a mob of white people approaching him.

18:12.820 --> 18:17.940
It really depends on the context there and how legitimate the lethal threat is. And this. Let's

18:17.940 --> 18:25.940
say that there are 10 people. Okay. They're gathered on the beach. And unfortunately today

18:25.940 --> 18:31.940
there is a lost soul. Okay. He's a hundred meters out. This guy is fucked. And none of the people

18:31.940 --> 18:36.420
on the beach, they're not good enough swimmers to go get him. Okay. Now let's say another guy

18:36.420 --> 18:42.900
walks by. Okay. This guy is called Chad marks. Okay. Some people call him Charles marks. Okay.

18:42.900 --> 18:48.740
This guy is a fucking state champion swimmer and he walks by and he sees that kid out there.

18:49.860 --> 18:56.500
Do you think that that guy with his additional means with all that he has available to him,

18:57.220 --> 19:01.780
do you think that it would be just as morally neutral for him to stand by and watch that person

19:01.780 --> 19:06.820
drown as the other 10 less capable people on that beach? Could he simply say, I mean, I don't have

19:06.820 --> 19:10.260
like an obligation, but that would be good if I did, but like, I mean, I could just sit here and

19:10.260 --> 19:13.300
watch it happen. I don't think it's bad. It's just morally neutral. If I sit here and watch him,

19:13.300 --> 19:21.300
if he has the means otherwise, I should go out and save the person. Okay. Why is that dis analogous?

19:21.940 --> 19:29.060
Okay. Because if that they decided not to do that thing, if they decided to abstain,

19:29.060 --> 19:33.940
it would cost a person their life. Whereas in the case of a lefty opening a business,

19:33.940 --> 19:37.540
their decision to open, it would not add any negative utility to the world.

19:40.980 --> 19:46.180
So in that case, we're, we're talking about for a lefty, it's either you abstain and you have

19:46.180 --> 19:52.100
nothing or you participate and you have nothing assuming you don't do extra battery. Okay. That's

19:52.100 --> 19:59.140
not really material to the swimmer. If they abstain, you have a death. And if they participate,

19:59.140 --> 20:05.540
you have that's not at all material to the participation and abstinence in these two

20:05.540 --> 20:11.860
examples met very different outcomes. Well, participation in a morally righteous way,

20:11.860 --> 20:16.020
and the swimming one could result in saving somebody's life participation in a righteous

20:16.020 --> 20:20.660
way. And the economic sense could be you opening a business that improves the material conditions of

20:20.660 --> 20:24.020
multiple other workers and families. I think those are comfortable. I think that'd be great.

20:24.020 --> 20:29.940
Okay. Abstinence in one sense is you just stand by and you watch a person drown an abstinence,

20:29.940 --> 20:33.620
which is negative and abstinence. And the business sense is you just stand by and you

20:33.620 --> 20:38.660
watch another business open up and exploit workers, which would be neutral, but the death

20:38.660 --> 20:44.100
is negative. How is that? Okay. I never, ever, ever want you to say again that like capitalism

20:44.100 --> 20:48.420
is negative or business owners are bad because you understand my argument enough. I guess not

20:48.420 --> 20:52.260
because you've bit the neutral bullet on basically every single actor in a capitalist system.

20:52.260 --> 20:56.660
I I'm sorry. If there's some irreconcilable difference that we're not going to resolve here,

20:56.660 --> 21:02.500
then we might as well not waste an additional hour on it. If you acknowledge that when a lefty opens

21:02.500 --> 21:07.140
a business and let's say pays market rates, same as everyone else, and the workers are treated

21:07.140 --> 21:12.260
fine, really middle of the road, as hard as that is to abstract, all you are doing in a purely

21:12.260 --> 21:18.580
empirical sense is giving local workers an additional choice, an additional place that

21:18.580 --> 21:24.740
they could sell their labor to an unethical institution, unfortunate, but you are not

21:24.740 --> 21:31.140
compelling or mandating or directing any direct harm. If you didn't do that, there would be no

21:31.220 --> 21:36.260
benefit. But if you have the means to know, if you have the means to act in a way that's in

21:36.260 --> 21:41.140
more accordance in more, no, if you have the means to act in harmony with your principles,

21:41.780 --> 21:50.420
then for you to do less, I genuinely think that your perspective on this issue has been tainted

21:50.420 --> 21:54.980
or corroded in some way by the people that you've argued on. If it's been tainted or corroded by

21:54.980 --> 21:59.460
anything, it's by the fact that I went to a Jesuit high school and what a part of what we taught,

21:59.460 --> 22:01.620
I guess, was like that you should live your principles.

22:01.620 --> 22:07.380
If you still have any delusions about whether or not Vash believes what he's saying, or really any

22:07.380 --> 22:12.580
other breadtuber who parrots his rhetoric, I hope this puts them to bed. This is what a grifter

22:12.580 --> 22:17.940
actually is. When you openly, nakedly say that truth does not exist beyond what you can twist

22:17.940 --> 22:22.180
people into believing, that winning is more important than being correct, that the appearance

22:22.180 --> 22:27.300
of being anti-corporate is more important than living your principles, there is no more clear

22:27.300 --> 22:31.700
example of a grifter than that. The problem with the grifter worldview that Vash espouses

22:31.700 --> 22:37.940
is that eventually reality will snap back. It does not matter how many laborers or scientists

22:37.940 --> 22:44.580
or engineers that Soviet commissar Vash browbeats into submission, if you don't adhere to objective

22:44.580 --> 22:49.220
real-world truth at some point, you're gonna get Chernobyl out of your nuclear program.

22:49.220 --> 22:53.460
You can scream that two plus two doesn't equal four as much as you want, but the mushroom cloud

22:53.460 --> 22:57.540
forming over the ruins of your project does not care. And while that is an extreme comparison,

22:57.540 --> 23:01.860
this sort of thing happens all the time when you ignore the truth. What happened to Ethan Ralph,

23:01.860 --> 23:06.660
Andy Warsky, Mr. Medicker, Channel Awesome, Game Grumps, or any other YouTube channel or

23:06.660 --> 23:11.540
online personality that ignored the truth in favor of grifting, hoping their popularity would allow

23:11.540 --> 23:16.660
them to skate on by? They're all shadows of their former selves, and that will be where Vash finds

23:16.660 --> 23:21.700
himself sooner or later. The reason grifters have to keep leaving town eventually and move on,

23:21.700 --> 23:26.420
is because the people they swindle inevitably catch up to them. The act of grifting makes

23:26.420 --> 23:31.220
enemies of your own audience, the very people that pay you. You can't run away from that forever.

23:31.220 --> 23:36.180
The clapback will come for Vash and the rest of BreadTube in due time. And just like it did with

23:36.180 --> 23:40.500
Ralph, with Warsky, Medicker, Channel Awesome, and Game Grumps, I will be here with a bucket of

23:40.500 --> 23:46.420
popcorn, laughing my ass off about it. Thank you for watching my friends. If you enjoyed this
