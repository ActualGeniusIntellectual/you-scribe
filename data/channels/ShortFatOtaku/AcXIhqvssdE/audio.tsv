0	8740	Answer? Me. There, I beat you to it.
8740	12640	People throw the word grifter around a lot, so I figured it's probably best to actually
12640	16620	talk about what it means. From a historical point of view, the root of the word comes
16620	21820	from graft, which appeared around the 15th century in botanical context. You know, like
21820	26940	grafting plant shoots and such. Through the botanical influence, by the 19th century,
26940	31520	the maximum amount of soil you could dig up with a shovel or a spade in one scoop was
31520	36680	known as that tool's graft. And shortly thereafter, the act of digging was known as
36680	39880	grafting. This later generalized to any kind of hard work.
39880	46360	By 1865, graft was considered a slang term for obtaining profit or advantage by dishonest
46360	52460	or shady means, especially bribery, blackmail, or the abuse of a position of power or influence.
52460	57160	The shift from honest hard work to dishonest tactics that nonetheless still may require
57160	62540	hard work to pull off is also attributed to the term's origin in botany. Grafting techniques
62540	67940	of that era often created excrescences in the plants, an excrescence being a distinct
67940	72780	abnormal outgrowth of a living organism that is malformed or diseased in some way. The
72780	77680	implication is obvious. While a graft may require as much effort as honest work, it
77680	82320	is not actually honest work. By the turn of the century, grift was considered a diminutive
82320	87060	form of graft, which is commonly done in the English language by replacing a word's
87060	92240	vowel with the letter I. A grafter was considered to be somebody who engages in political corruption,
92240	97360	and a grifter was a small-time confidence man or a carnival swindler. And while grafters
97360	102360	usage in this way has fallen out of popularity, mingling with its botanical and hard-working
102360	106920	variants, grifter has remained to the present day. It currently refers to a person who is
106920	111900	willing to say or do anything to make money, but not in a positive, hard-working context,
111940	116440	but rather in a negative, dishonest context. They have no problems with lying, cheating,
116440	120360	or stealing. They will say things that they explicitly know to be false, or they will
120360	125040	completely abandon the idea of consistency in their pursuits. To be a grifter, it helps
125040	129200	to be a sociopath, but it's not exactly necessary. You just have to know how to manipulate
129200	133140	people and to make them think they want to give you their money, at least long enough
133140	136640	for them to actually give it to you. Boy, I knew that English degree would pay off one
136640	140080	day. Hit up my subscribe store if you want to help me pay for it. Unless you actually
140080	143620	consider me a grifter, then I guess it's okay. But that's the rub, isn't it? If
143620	147760	I were a real grifter, and as part of the grift I was trying to create a reputation
147760	153040	based on honesty and voluntary action, I would say things like, here's my donation, Lynx
153040	156480	guys. You don't have to donate if you can't afford it, though. Who knows if I'm being
156480	160540	compassionate towards my viewers, or I'm just cultivating an image of compassion in
160540	163860	order to get paid without actually meaning it. Who knows what level of the game each
163860	167780	of us are playing at? And the truth is, you can't really know. A perfect grifter will
167780	172000	never let you. Nowadays, if you hang around political YouTube, you'll notice the terms
172000	176820	grift or grifter tossed around quite a bit. There's a commie channel called The Serfs,
176820	180300	fitting name considering that's where their ideas lead, that really seems to love those
180300	185040	terms. Let's analyze a few examples. It's simultaneously hilarious and rage-inducing
185040	188860	that anyone threw money at this grift, said in reference to the Lincoln Project, which
188860	192880	is an organization that appeals to the broader left and Democrat voters for donations in
192880	197480	order to combat Trumpism from a rightist position. They did so by supporting Republicans that
197480	203100	— while they were anti-Trump — were still not Democrats or leftists. Are these people
203100	207780	grifters? I mean, maybe. They did take money from left-leaning sources who were too dumb
207780	212140	to think beyond orange man fascist, and never really made it clear where that money was
212140	216580	going until they started endorsing anti-Trump Republicans. Just a friendly reminder that
216580	221120	the free marketplace of ideas is a complete grift, said in reference to Dave Rubin blocking
221120	225120	them over some Twitter trolling. I don't really know about Dave Rubin being a grifter,
225120	229420	although Joe Rogan seems to think he is nowadays. Kanye was the wrecking machine, but I actually
229420	234220	think, I think in the grand scheme of things, Candace is much bigger. I really believe that
234220	235220	in terms of —
235220	236220	Why?
236220	239700	Because I think she could be a direct line to all of the political parts of this if she
239700	243940	decides to go that route, because I think she could, I think she could run for Senate
243940	244940	or —
244940	245940	What?
245940	246940	Yeah.
246940	247940	You said you watched the podcast I did with her.
247940	248940	Yeah.
248940	249940	Okay.
249940	250940	Yeah. I watched, I don't know, maybe at least an hour and a half of it or so.
250940	251940	Okay.
251940	252940	Yeah. Why?
252940	253940	Why what?
254760	256760	I don't know. Why are you saying it that way?
259760	263680	I mean, I don't want to name any names, but there's a bunch of people that do it blatantly.
263680	267840	You see them, and I've even seen them switch teams, and you see them switch teams, and
267840	271680	I don't buy their rationalizations when it comes to ideology. What I think is what they're
271680	275240	doing is they're switching teams because they realize there's an in on this team.
275240	276240	Right.
276240	279040	And they can just say, this is the problem with the team I used to be on, those fucking
279040	284980	losers, and they're really Benedict Arnold, right? And like, they probably have as much
284980	289620	of an affinity to the ideas of one side as they do the other side. They just go all in
289620	292020	on one side to get acceptance from the group.
292020	296740	Will you go on Joe Rogan's podcast, and will you have Libertarian presidential VP candidate
296740	301640	on your show before the election? Will I go on Rogan's podcast? I asked him, and our PR
301640	307300	people asked him about a bajillion times to go on for my book. We did not get a response
307300	312200	as far as I know, so I don't know what happened there. A little weird for me to say that publicly.
312200	314600	I don't know what happened.
314600	320880	Even if you disagree with the way people feel about so many different things, it doesn't
320880	326280	mean you can't be their friend. It doesn't. And I'm telling you, we got it wrong. Here's
326280	332200	what's important. What's important is whoever that person is, they got to be sincere. Now,
332200	337660	as soon as you feel like someone's a grifter, you got to cast them out. You got to cast
337660	341700	them out, because they got to figure that out on their own, and they got to apologize.
341700	346620	That's cool, man. You got, listen, you can be wrong, but you have to be honest. And if
346620	349700	you're just bullshitting, then I can't hang out with you.
349700	354220	And I got to say, it is kind of funny to see Lance regurgitate a repainted, so much for
354220	358220	the tolerant left style argument. So your platitudes were utterly meaningless and you
358220	363080	were a grift all along, thanks for clearing that up, said in anger out of Andrew Yang
363080	369320	supporting Biden over Bernie. So is making moves out of political pragmatism a grift?
369320	374160	Because that's literally what you and every other breadtuber and nearly every other leftist
374160	378000	ultimately did when you decided you were riding with Biden a few months later. I think it's
378000	382980	probably funniest to juxtapose these two examples, though. The joy of being a leftist is wearing
382980	386960	your values like a badge instead of a grift in response to Tim Pool's assertion that
386960	391420	some moderates are afraid of speaking about their values publicly due to the far left.
391420	396860	And your woke grift is tired when Paul Joseph Watson talks about the dominant religions
396860	401680	of countries most likely to stone gay people to death. I'm sure you've noticed by now
401680	406180	the obvious, what stands out like a sore thumb when I put these two tweets together. According
406180	410620	to Lance, it's a grift when it's somebody he disagrees with politically, but it's wearing
410620	414660	your values like a badge when it's a fellow lefty. Nowhere in that extended definition
414660	419140	of grifter that I armed you with earlier in the video did I say that its definition
419140	424680	is somebody you personally disagree with, and yet that seems to overwhelmingly be the
424680	429880	way that radicals use the term. Most of Joe Rogan's top viewed interviews are grifters.
429880	434520	Now you may disagree with Alex Jones, Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson or Steven Crowder,
434520	438640	but are they really grifters? Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson seem to genuinely believe
438640	443220	what they say, even if you might disagree with them. While Alex Jones and Steven Crowder,
443220	447120	on some level, though obviously not entirely, are exaggerating some of what they say for
447120	452640	comedic effect. When people take sponsorships, sell products, or plug their patreons, is
452640	457020	the only criteria for them being a grifter whether or not the accuser agrees with their
457020	461560	point of view? Not if the creator thinks they're telling the truth, not if they actually provide
461560	466880	the good or service they're selling, but is it really all just politics to these people?
466880	471400	Sargon is an excellent example. These accusations are a dime a dozen. Lol, Sargon is such an
471400	475260	unbelievable grifter. Alright, let's see what they're talking about.
475260	481240	Joe Biden likens Ted Cruz to Nazi propaganda's gerbils for helping Trump spread big lie about
481240	488260	election fraud. That's mad. That's mad. Biden not even in office yet, and he's already calling
488260	494180	Trump and his administration Nazis. Trump can't even speak back on the allegation because
494180	497920	they've torn out his tongue. Unreal.
497920	503880	This is genocidal rhetoric. This is terrible. It is awful, awful what the Democrats are
503880	508160	doing right now. And the thing is, with so much power, you would think that they would
508160	514840	have some kind of grace, but instead they've gone into full-on vicious absolutely crush
514840	521800	our opponents mode, and that's quite terrifying. And it shows that it is the left that has
521800	527520	been the problem. It is the way that they operate in politics. They are not tolerant.
527520	531840	And the problem with not being tolerant is it means you can't run a democracy.
531840	535620	What is so objectionable about this clip? Okay, you may disagree with what Sargon's
535620	540560	saying. If you think he's wrong, fair enough. But clearly he believes it, and clearly he's
540560	544500	speaking to an audience of people who also believe it. So if he's delivering the product
544500	548380	they're paying for, how is it a grift? This is like a radical Christian saying that an
548380	553900	LGBT YouTube channel, catering specifically to people interested in LGBT ideology, is
553900	557780	a grift for delivering a product they're advertising that people actually want. Here's
557780	562940	a lengthy criticism of Sargon from the now-defunct subreddit of ChapoTraphouse, and it's clear
562940	567980	that they're trying to turn I disagree with Sargon politically into some blanket statement
567980	572060	about his character and his business. This is a man who dropped out of college to scam
572060	576620	people out of a video game Kickstarter and use that money to run a five-year right-wing
576620	581420	grifting project that consists of him shitting on feminists while calling himself a classical
581420	586180	liberal. Not only is this factually inaccurate, Sargon refunded the money and posted the receipts
586180	590620	last I heard, it's also one of the most try-hard things I've ever read. Right up there with
590620	595820	lol I have more subs and views than you, internet clout totally matters you guys. Let's take
595820	599860	this caption, remove all of the personal attacks and statements of political difference, and
599860	604780	see what criticisms actually remain. Nothing he's said ever provided an idea, concept or
604780	610580	solution to modern problems. He's never said anything useful besides SJWs bad. He's never
610580	615580	provided a radical idea that can change the world, unlike Ruder Bregman and Richard Wolf
615580	622060	on the left, or Jordan Peterson and Andrew Yang on the right. Nothing he's said has provided
622060	628060	valuable discourse, etc, etc. It basically boils down to two points. One, Sargon has
628060	631900	never proposed a solution to the problems he points out, and two, all the problems he
631900	637660	points out are SJWs bad. Even for back when this was written, I don't think this was the case. But
637660	644420	nonetheless, if you are legitimately an anti-SJW individual selling anti-SJW content, and your
644420	650380	viewers are all anti-SJWs looking for that content, how is this a grift? When a radical calls
650380	655180	somebody who's in the mainstream center, you know, the Liberals, the Conservatives, grifters,
655180	660580	they're generally not saying here is a person lying, cheating, and stealing, saying things
660660	664980	they know to be false, being hypocritical in order to get paid. Instead, they're saying,
664980	670100	here is a person presenting ideas I think are false, and because I'm obviously correct about
670100	675020	everything, they are taking money from people for reasons I don't approve of. Let's swing back to
675020	679780	the serfs for one final chuckle. Anybody who says they're a socialist but isn't comfortable forming
679780	684380	a worker co-op, or is a progressive who extols the virtues of worker rights and refuses to let
684380	690460	their workers unionize, is a grifter. Why yes, I do agree, Lance. This is why literally everybody
690500	696260	laughed when Vosch said his business did not have to be a worker co-op, including myself. Check out
696260	700900	my old Eat the Rich video on that topic if you like. Now, I don't believe the serfs are grifters.
700900	705100	They might say a lot of dumb shit all the time, but I actually think they probably believe it.
705100	709900	However, who knows if they're actually living it. In general, if you're a radical, you're also more
709900	714820	likely to be a hypocrite. Yes, the number of male feminists who are forcefully respecting women with
714820	720900	their penis is truly astounding. Yes, the number of cult leaders and mega church pastors who live
720900	728260	hedonistic lives seems to be basically 100%. And yes, progressives and neo-socialists who spout
728260	733060	rhetoric about wanting the workers revolution, while exploiting everybody around them as hard
733060	738500	and fast as they can, just seems to be the thing that BreadTube does. This realization was the
738500	743380	center of the most recent debate between Vosch and Destiny, where PhilosophyTube was raking in shit
743380	748060	tons of money online, keeping her income private, when a common lefty line of thought is that the
748060	753100	expectation that incomes are kept private is one way that bosses keep workers in line by preventing
753100	757440	them from comparing their pay, all the while encouraging people way less well-off than her
757440	762380	to go on rent strikes and other stuff like this. If it sounds hypocritical, that's because it is.
762380	767380	And Vosch defended her in such a way that he basically revealed himself to be somebody not
767380	773380	interested in truth, or even socialism at all on some level, but only raw power. No, really.
797380	799460	There was so much of that shit that I fucking turned down.
799460	803460	So you've turned, okay, good. And you've turned down, and I for my part have turned down
803460	809380	every sponsorship. Why? It's not a part of my aesthetic. I don't want to. Okay, wait, then
810900	814900	don't make those things the same. Don't, don't, wait, wait, don't compare that to me.
814900	819620	Okay. You're on a lower level there. Okay. I intentionally, no, no, no, no, no, hold on,
819620	824260	hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. I intentionally have foregone money that I could use otherwise
824260	828100	because it is in accordance with my principles. Okay. You're not doing it because it doesn't fit
828100	832500	the aesthetic that you sell on your YouTube channel. That comparison to me was insulting
832500	836820	because I don't not take certain sponsorships because of my aesthetic. I do it because of my
836820	840980	principles. Those two things are very different. That's what upset me. Do you understand?
840980	846340	When I said, when I said aesthetic, I suppose you wouldn't buy me saying as a lefty,
846340	851140	I don't like the idea of doing legwork for corporations to advertise products that I
851140	856100	don't give a fuck about, but you would say that's walking back because what I actually believe is
856100	861380	that it's purely an aesthetic flourish and me flushing it out. Now that I realize you've been
861380	866660	made upset by my language is the thing is, is what I would say is I wouldn't believe you. I don't
866660	870100	believe that. I don't buy that. Okay. I know, I know you don't because you've assigned me so
870100	875140	little charitability. No, it's because the first response is the most likely to be honest. And this,
875140	878420	there are plenty of like higher order things that could be fucking with our ability to understand.
878420	881940	Yes, that's true. Right. Okay. So if you acknowledge that and you're a moral
881940	886420	anti-realist, so there is actually no choice of the matter, which theory of truth is right.
886420	890420	Then you also acknowledge that any empirical statement I make is also arbitrary.
891460	895940	I mean, I think it would be arbitrary in so far as we would have to disagree on like the meaning
895940	899620	of truth, but I think that most people have subscribed to the idea that truth means something
899620	903780	that could be empirically verified. If a person disagreed with that, I would have to kill them.
903780	907780	There's no truth that there nothing is objective. Nothing is true. Or it's all relative to what
907780	911700	someone wants. Yeah. Everything. But I do think you can make an empirical statement about the
911700	916500	world. Well, that depends on you. Wait, yes. The morality of the Holocaust depends on your
916500	920820	subjective- No, not morality, whether it happened. Oh, whether it happened? Sure. If you have a
920820	924820	different definition of truth, then yeah. But if a person- And you can't say that they're wrong,
924820	929300	they're just- Oh no. Well, I don't have to say that they're wrong. All I have to do is convince
929300	933940	them. Well, right now you are basically saying that. I would disagree with them. I would try
933940	936900	to convince them off that point. Yeah, you would disagree with them, but you have to acknowledge
936900	941620	from this, you know- Yes, I acknowledge that. I've always acknowledged that. Yeah, it's about
941620	947940	power. So you're in a state of complete nihilism about the world. No one's position is more
947940	953300	justified than another. No, I care about things. Inherently, no. Correct. Wow. Okay. So you're
953300	958660	literally incomplete. So actually right now, if I wanted to, I could flip a coin and if it lands
958660	963460	heads or tails, I'm correct about this issue. And you have no way to refute what I just said.
963460	968420	Empirically, no. But I could argue that that's dumb. Wow. Well, it doesn't matter. I mean,
968420	972020	if you just acknowledge all you do is just scream at people to make you feel good. Wait, yeah,
972020	976100	wait, wait. No, I don't, wait. I don't scream at people. So you don't care about truth in the
976100	980020	world, I guess. Wait. Yeah, I do. I care about my truth in the world. Yeah. You care about how you
980020	985220	feel. Yeah. Yes. Because all moral positions are downstream of our subjective emotional preferences.
985220	990340	How many times do I have to refrain this? No, no. It's just, it's crazy to me hearing you say it.
990340	996340	Like two plus two equals four, right? There are multiple theories of truth. Something can be true
996340	1000900	because it's actually existing in the world, right? Which is probably what you view truth as.
1000900	1006580	You know, the cup is red is true if it is actually, okay. There's another theory of truth. It could be
1006580	1012260	something is true if and only if it makes me feel good, right? My question to you would then be,
1012260	1016900	well, which of those theories of truth should I adopt? It depends on which moral system you
1016900	1020500	subscribe to. If you subscribe to a different one and that causes me harm, I could just like
1020500	1025540	kill you. So you acknowledge that theories of truth are moral statements. All of thought is
1025540	1030020	just power grabs between people who can decide subjectively whether or not their positions are
1030020	1035940	better than others. That is all power grabs. Unironically. Wow. In some cases. The truth of
1035940	1042340	whether the Holocaust happened, a power grab. Yes. And this. The thing on like mob rule,
1042340	1046020	I don't believe, I can't believe that you think that. There's no way that you do. Do you not feel
1046020	1051220	I've applied a consistent standard where I think it's more moral to just submit yourself to the mob
1051220	1057540	than it is to just kill everyone who comes for you? If I submitted a consistent standard,
1057540	1061700	I don't think it's fair for you to accuse me of being in bad faith. It is consistent. Maybe that's
1061700	1065060	how people feel when they argue against me and I'm consistent in something. Maybe you genuinely do
1065060	1069220	believe that. I guess it's possible, but I'll be super serious in the future. Cause I, cause I can
1069220	1073700	think of a lot of scenarios that are really sweats to me where fucking black dudes have been lynched
1073700	1077700	by white people thinking they were in the right where saying that like, well, well, but then you
1077700	1080740	even said that earlier, maybe the black guy should just submit himself to get arrested and then they
1080740	1084820	can hash out a court. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. If people are coming to arrest the
1084820	1088420	black guy, then yeah, I think that he should submit to arrest rather than gunning down a bunch
1088420	1092820	of unarmed white people. Not to submit to arrest, but like a mob of white people approaching him.
1092820	1097940	It really depends on the context there and how legitimate the lethal threat is. And this. Let's
1097940	1105940	say that there are 10 people. Okay. They're gathered on the beach. And unfortunately today
1105940	1111940	there is a lost soul. Okay. He's a hundred meters out. This guy is fucked. And none of the people
1111940	1116420	on the beach, they're not good enough swimmers to go get him. Okay. Now let's say another guy
1116420	1122900	walks by. Okay. This guy is called Chad marks. Okay. Some people call him Charles marks. Okay.
1122900	1128740	This guy is a fucking state champion swimmer and he walks by and he sees that kid out there.
1129860	1136500	Do you think that that guy with his additional means with all that he has available to him,
1137220	1141780	do you think that it would be just as morally neutral for him to stand by and watch that person
1141780	1146820	drown as the other 10 less capable people on that beach? Could he simply say, I mean, I don't have
1146820	1150260	like an obligation, but that would be good if I did, but like, I mean, I could just sit here and
1150260	1153300	watch it happen. I don't think it's bad. It's just morally neutral. If I sit here and watch him,
1153300	1161300	if he has the means otherwise, I should go out and save the person. Okay. Why is that dis analogous?
1161940	1169060	Okay. Because if that they decided not to do that thing, if they decided to abstain,
1169060	1173940	it would cost a person their life. Whereas in the case of a lefty opening a business,
1173940	1177540	their decision to open, it would not add any negative utility to the world.
1180980	1186180	So in that case, we're, we're talking about for a lefty, it's either you abstain and you have
1186180	1192100	nothing or you participate and you have nothing assuming you don't do extra battery. Okay. That's
1192100	1199140	not really material to the swimmer. If they abstain, you have a death. And if they participate,
1199140	1205540	you have that's not at all material to the participation and abstinence in these two
1205540	1211860	examples met very different outcomes. Well, participation in a morally righteous way,
1211860	1216020	and the swimming one could result in saving somebody's life participation in a righteous
1216020	1220660	way. And the economic sense could be you opening a business that improves the material conditions of
1220660	1224020	multiple other workers and families. I think those are comfortable. I think that'd be great.
1224020	1229940	Okay. Abstinence in one sense is you just stand by and you watch a person drown an abstinence,
1229940	1233620	which is negative and abstinence. And the business sense is you just stand by and you
1233620	1238660	watch another business open up and exploit workers, which would be neutral, but the death
1238660	1244100	is negative. How is that? Okay. I never, ever, ever want you to say again that like capitalism
1244100	1248420	is negative or business owners are bad because you understand my argument enough. I guess not
1248420	1252260	because you've bit the neutral bullet on basically every single actor in a capitalist system.
1252260	1256660	I I'm sorry. If there's some irreconcilable difference that we're not going to resolve here,
1256660	1262500	then we might as well not waste an additional hour on it. If you acknowledge that when a lefty opens
1262500	1267140	a business and let's say pays market rates, same as everyone else, and the workers are treated
1267140	1272260	fine, really middle of the road, as hard as that is to abstract, all you are doing in a purely
1272260	1278580	empirical sense is giving local workers an additional choice, an additional place that
1278580	1284740	they could sell their labor to an unethical institution, unfortunate, but you are not
1284740	1291140	compelling or mandating or directing any direct harm. If you didn't do that, there would be no
1291220	1296260	benefit. But if you have the means to know, if you have the means to act in a way that's in
1296260	1301140	more accordance in more, no, if you have the means to act in harmony with your principles,
1301780	1310420	then for you to do less, I genuinely think that your perspective on this issue has been tainted
1310420	1314980	or corroded in some way by the people that you've argued on. If it's been tainted or corroded by
1314980	1319460	anything, it's by the fact that I went to a Jesuit high school and what a part of what we taught,
1319460	1321620	I guess, was like that you should live your principles.
1321620	1327380	If you still have any delusions about whether or not Vash believes what he's saying, or really any
1327380	1332580	other breadtuber who parrots his rhetoric, I hope this puts them to bed. This is what a grifter
1332580	1337940	actually is. When you openly, nakedly say that truth does not exist beyond what you can twist
1337940	1342180	people into believing, that winning is more important than being correct, that the appearance
1342180	1347300	of being anti-corporate is more important than living your principles, there is no more clear
1347300	1351700	example of a grifter than that. The problem with the grifter worldview that Vash espouses
1351700	1357940	is that eventually reality will snap back. It does not matter how many laborers or scientists
1357940	1364580	or engineers that Soviet commissar Vash browbeats into submission, if you don't adhere to objective
1364580	1369220	real-world truth at some point, you're gonna get Chernobyl out of your nuclear program.
1369220	1373460	You can scream that two plus two doesn't equal four as much as you want, but the mushroom cloud
1373460	1377540	forming over the ruins of your project does not care. And while that is an extreme comparison,
1377540	1381860	this sort of thing happens all the time when you ignore the truth. What happened to Ethan Ralph,
1381860	1386660	Andy Warsky, Mr. Medicker, Channel Awesome, Game Grumps, or any other YouTube channel or
1386660	1391540	online personality that ignored the truth in favor of grifting, hoping their popularity would allow
1391540	1396660	them to skate on by? They're all shadows of their former selves, and that will be where Vash finds
1396660	1401700	himself sooner or later. The reason grifters have to keep leaving town eventually and move on,
1401700	1406420	is because the people they swindle inevitably catch up to them. The act of grifting makes
1406420	1411220	enemies of your own audience, the very people that pay you. You can't run away from that forever.
1411220	1416180	The clapback will come for Vash and the rest of BreadTube in due time. And just like it did with
1416180	1420500	Ralph, with Warsky, Medicker, Channel Awesome, and Game Grumps, I will be here with a bucket of
1420500	1426420	popcorn, laughing my ass off about it. Thank you for watching my friends. If you enjoyed this
