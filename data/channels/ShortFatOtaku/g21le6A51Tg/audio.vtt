00:00.000 --> 00:00.500
Hello?

00:02.700 --> 00:03.900
Hello, how's it going?

00:04.500 --> 00:05.800
Hey, how's it going?

00:07.800 --> 00:08.400
Pretty good.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.300
I'm just really busy.

00:10.400 --> 00:10.800
Hold on.

00:11.000 --> 00:11.800
I just got a stretch.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.500
Okay, what's going on?

00:15.500 --> 00:18.500
Hey, your camera on Discord looks really different than your

00:18.500 --> 00:20.000
camera on the stream.

00:20.000 --> 00:20.400
What happened?

00:20.400 --> 00:21.100
Yeah, I fucked it up.

00:21.100 --> 00:21.400
Sorry.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.400
Give me a second here.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.800
Hello, welcome to the stream.

00:36.200 --> 00:36.900
How are you doing?

00:38.300 --> 00:39.300
Very good.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.300
Very well.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.300
I've just been I've been doing a lot of writing and reading.

00:42.300 --> 00:46.000
My next project is on Antonio Gramsci.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.600
So I mean, it's you can't read the entire prison notebooks

00:50.600 --> 00:52.100
in, you know, two days.

00:52.100 --> 00:55.200
It's like a 500 page book, but

00:55.200 --> 01:01.000
I don't know if you know who who's is it socked on left

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
soaked on left.

01:02.100 --> 01:05.700
Yeah, he's kind of an idiot a lot of the time.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.300
I don't know if you agree with me.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.100
I don't know enough about the stuff he talks about that

01:10.100 --> 01:10.800
really knows.

01:10.900 --> 01:11.400
Okay.

01:11.800 --> 01:15.600
Now he made some some of these stupid claims about

01:15.600 --> 01:18.800
Antonio Gramsci like a week ago and I've been putting off

01:19.000 --> 01:22.100
doing my video on the prison notebooks for about six months

01:22.100 --> 01:24.800
mainly at a laziness and I was like, you know what it's it's

01:24.800 --> 01:25.900
kind of time to talk about it.

01:25.900 --> 01:29.700
I think because you know who Gramsci is?

01:30.700 --> 01:31.500
Yeah, I do.

01:31.500 --> 01:31.800
Yeah.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.400
Okay, you know that a lot of right oids on the internet tend

01:37.400 --> 01:38.700
to misquote him.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.200
Do you know what that I don't know about that?

01:42.200 --> 01:42.500
No.

01:42.700 --> 01:43.000
Okay.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.500
So there's a very famous Gramsci quote floating around

01:46.500 --> 01:51.000
it turns out it's actually not from Gramsci and the entire

01:51.000 --> 01:53.900
right wing ecosystem is kind of built off this quote.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.700
However, even though Gramsci didn't say the quote he said

01:57.700 --> 02:00.800
stuff in his writing that is enough like it that it's pretty

02:00.800 --> 02:01.700
much accurate.

02:02.100 --> 02:06.400
So I'm gonna go over what he what he said what soaked and

02:06.400 --> 02:08.900
left said was correct and also and but and ultimately where

02:08.900 --> 02:09.500
he's wrong.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.500
So that's that's a big project that I'm working on right

02:12.500 --> 02:12.700
now.

02:12.700 --> 02:16.900
Yeah, sounds like it sounds like it and that'll be that'll

02:16.900 --> 02:19.800
be out probably next week or so very cool.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.000
I mean you've watched my videos now you notice that like

02:23.000 --> 02:27.400
some of them just have like the the fat laughing dev background.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.200
Those are like my less serious videos.

02:30.200 --> 02:33.400
And then the more serious ones are more edited like the

02:33.400 --> 02:34.600
three forms of fascism.

02:34.900 --> 02:36.300
This one's going to be a more edited one.

02:36.700 --> 02:37.800
So that's cool.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.200
Yeah, your forms of fascism one was really good.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.300
So yeah, I get a lot of compliments on it.

02:44.600 --> 02:47.100
There are people who really didn't like it because they

02:47.100 --> 02:49.900
thought the idea of libertarian fascism is stupid.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.700
It is a stupid idea, but people do believe it, you know people

02:52.700 --> 02:54.100
believe a lot in a lot of stupid ideas.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.100
Yeah, for sure.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.900
Well post me post that I'm talking to you somewhere.

02:59.900 --> 03:00.600
Give me a second.

03:01.000 --> 03:01.200
Yeah.

03:01.200 --> 03:01.500
Yeah.

03:01.500 --> 03:01.800
Yeah.

03:01.800 --> 03:08.600
We're here to talk about gamergate chat educate me on

03:08.600 --> 03:09.300
gamergate.

03:09.300 --> 03:09.500
Now.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.500
I've already looked at some of the stuff around it.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.100
Oh my God.

03:12.100 --> 03:16.700
Why do I have Nikkato avocados ass on my on my God, Jesus

03:16.700 --> 03:17.100
Christ.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.500
I did some reading about it.

03:22.300 --> 03:26.400
So like I have the timeline of gamergate, you know pulled

03:26.400 --> 03:26.600
up.

03:26.600 --> 03:31.800
I've been kind of going through that but I guess yeah,

03:32.100 --> 03:36.900
you're going to educate me on gamergate God the ancient

03:36.900 --> 03:38.100
lore of gamergate.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.900
It's been like 10 fucking years.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.300
Yeah, so sorry.

03:43.300 --> 03:43.600
Go ahead.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.000
Go ahead.

03:45.100 --> 03:49.800
So it all started with this Zoe Quinn this post about Zoe

03:49.800 --> 03:50.600
Quinn, right?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Did you read the post?

03:52.100 --> 03:52.900
I think it's still up.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.500
Yeah, I read some of it.

03:55.500 --> 03:59.200
I didn't read the entire thing, but basically her ex is

04:00.300 --> 04:02.100
accusing her of cheating, right?

04:02.600 --> 04:03.000
Mm-hmm.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.100
Do you think that she actually cheated on him?

04:06.500 --> 04:07.200
Oh, absolutely.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.400
The guys confirmed it at least three out of the five of them

04:09.400 --> 04:09.700
dead.

04:09.700 --> 04:10.000
Yeah.

04:12.200 --> 04:15.600
Like that part is not in dispute whatsoever that she did

04:15.600 --> 04:16.100
cheat on.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.800
Yeah, so one of them was Nathan Grayson.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.700
Let me just I'm just gonna pull his see what he's doing now.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.600
God this ancient lore.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.500
It's been so fucking long, dude, because what I was reading

04:30.500 --> 04:36.500
I read a bunch of different things but but there were like

04:36.500 --> 04:40.200
allegations that this guy was like abusive or whatever and

04:40.200 --> 04:45.400
that like, I don't know how true that is right that he like

04:45.400 --> 04:47.400
made up a whole bunch of stuff about her.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.600
So I guess I'm curious to to know like I guess how was this

04:55.600 --> 04:57.400
confirmed that she cheated on him?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.700
One of the guys at least of the of the five guys, you know,

05:02.700 --> 05:05.500
there was the five guys burgers and fries meme like that was

05:05.600 --> 05:06.200
I was part of it.

05:06.200 --> 05:06.600
Yeah.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.900
One of the guys was Nathan Grayson and Nathan Grayson said

05:10.000 --> 05:13.800
yes, we had a sexual relationship during during this time.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.800
The issue ultimately wasn't the cheating actually, you know

05:18.800 --> 05:21.000
what here before we get into it, you should you should give

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
me your view of gamergate like what you've learned about it

05:24.000 --> 05:26.200
what you think of it, you should hit me with the stardust

05:26.200 --> 05:27.300
interpretation first.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.000
I know very little about it.

05:29.000 --> 05:29.800
I'm going to be real with you.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.700
I know very little about I know that basically this post came

05:32.700 --> 05:33.800
out about Zoe Quinn.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.500
I know that it was less about the cheating and more about

05:38.200 --> 05:43.600
about the incestuous relationship that game reporters have

05:43.600 --> 05:48.600
with each other and and with a game developers and and it

05:48.600 --> 05:51.800
was kind of like it was kind of like talking about the

05:51.800 --> 05:57.700
corruption or not corruption, but like, you know, just the

05:59.200 --> 06:06.700
I guess the weirdness of that of that industry and I know

06:06.700 --> 06:11.600
that basically in response to this post being made about

06:12.000 --> 06:15.300
about Zoe Quinn a bunch of report.

06:15.300 --> 06:19.400
I think it was reporters spoke out against it.

06:20.800 --> 06:21.700
Am I correct?

06:22.600 --> 06:23.300
Yes.

06:23.700 --> 06:29.200
Okay, and because they spoke out against it like the majority

06:29.200 --> 06:32.900
of like the gaming world didn't really care about the post

06:32.900 --> 06:37.100
initially, but because they they spoke out against it drew

06:37.100 --> 06:40.000
more attention to it and then more of the gaming world kind

06:40.000 --> 06:45.100
of kind of caught on to it and it became a bigger thing.

06:46.100 --> 06:52.300
And then and then there were like some harassment campaigns

06:52.300 --> 06:55.400
that happened and everything from that point on.

06:55.700 --> 06:56.700
I'm a little bit.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.600
I'm a little bit.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.300
Yeah, I don't know a whole lot beyond that point.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.000
So right, right.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.400
So you're already a far-right fascist for even bringing

07:10.400 --> 07:11.900
up the ethics part of the conversation.

07:11.900 --> 07:16.400
By the way, I hope you know that you've I'm sorry, just

07:16.400 --> 07:17.600
one second wordsmith Andy.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.800
Thank you so much for the super chat.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.400
Sorry, go ahead.

07:20.200 --> 07:20.600
No problem.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.100
No problem.

07:23.900 --> 07:28.400
The issue is that there's two competing narratives regarding

07:28.400 --> 07:32.100
gamergate and it's now nine years ago and most of the people

07:32.100 --> 07:34.900
who were pro gamergate don't care anymore because it's been

07:34.900 --> 07:36.300
nine fucking years, right?

07:36.300 --> 07:38.500
Yeah, like it's it's old internet drama.

07:39.700 --> 07:43.700
If you go to Wikipedia, you can see the anti gamergate

07:43.700 --> 07:46.200
description of events and from their point of view.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.000
It's pretty accurate.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.800
If you go to know your meme, you can see the pro gamergate

07:50.900 --> 07:51.500
view of events.

07:51.500 --> 07:55.700
So if you want to get an overview of what both sides actually

07:55.700 --> 07:58.600
thought and like their versions of the timeline of events,

07:59.100 --> 08:00.700
both of those sources will give it to you.

08:01.700 --> 08:07.200
Um, there's if you were, if you were around in like 2015

08:07.400 --> 08:12.500
or 2016, you saw three things kind of conflated very heavily

08:12.500 --> 08:14.200
together in mainstream news.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.700
And that was gamergate Brexit and Trump that gamergate caused

08:18.700 --> 08:20.900
Brexit and then Brexit caused Trump.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.600
And it was all gamergate cause Brexit.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.900
That makes no sense to me.

08:25.300 --> 08:25.900
I know.

08:25.900 --> 08:31.100
And it's, it's some of the most ridiculous claims that

08:31.100 --> 08:31.700
I have seen.

08:32.300 --> 08:34.600
Or is just how like, okay, here, here, um, you know who

08:34.600 --> 08:36.700
Mundane Matt is his part of the gamergate drama.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.600
Uh, he made a video, right?

08:41.900 --> 08:42.200
Yeah.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.100
He made one of the first videos talking about the Zoe post

08:45.500 --> 08:48.500
and because he was one of the first ones and he was the

08:48.500 --> 08:52.100
one that Zoe Quinn chose to falsely DMCA to get his video

08:52.100 --> 08:53.600
down, he blew up.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.700
Wait, wait, wait, who, who?

08:56.300 --> 08:58.100
Zoe DMC claimed him.

08:58.300 --> 08:58.700
Yes.

08:59.700 --> 09:03.000
Zoe Quinn falsely DMCA'd Mundane Matt to get his video on

09:03.000 --> 09:04.300
the Zoe post taken down.

09:04.900 --> 09:05.300
Okay.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.100
And that's what made Mundane Matt blow up.

09:07.100 --> 09:09.000
And that's what made a whole bunch of YouTubers suddenly

09:09.000 --> 09:12.300
leap all over this story back in 2014, because that was

09:12.300 --> 09:15.100
seen as like an egregious, you know, censorship.

09:16.300 --> 09:21.600
Um, and Mundane Matt has since come out and said, now he's

09:21.600 --> 09:23.100
more progressive now than he was back then.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.600
And he's come out and he said stuff like, Hey, uh,

09:26.200 --> 09:28.300
you know, I, you know, I'm sorry for my part because I

09:28.300 --> 09:31.600
know that it led to, um, to the rise of reactionary politics.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.700
It led to Trump.

09:32.700 --> 09:33.400
It led to Brexit.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.700
It led to all of these things.

09:34.700 --> 09:39.800
And it's like, well, no, no, it didn't, but there is a

09:39.800 --> 09:41.900
narrative that it did, and I can explain that narrative.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.400
I don't really believe it, but I can explain it.

09:45.200 --> 09:50.900
Um, the, the idea basically is, is that there's there, I

09:50.900 --> 09:53.100
don't know if you were, if you were around 10 or 15 years

09:53.100 --> 09:56.000
ago, but there's been like a slow turning leftward of a

09:56.000 --> 09:59.400
lot of online spaces, you know, the, the old atheism of

09:59.400 --> 10:01.500
the two thousands, where everyone's going around, like

10:01.500 --> 10:04.000
just being intentionally edgy and tipping their fedoras

10:04.000 --> 10:07.600
everywhere, those guys became like atheism plus where it

10:07.600 --> 10:09.100
was all social justice focused.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.600
You know, there was, there was like stuff happening in

10:11.600 --> 10:13.700
comics, there was stuff happening in all of these,

10:13.700 --> 10:15.600
these kind of cultural spaces online.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.300
And then when it came, there was stuff happening in gaming

10:18.300 --> 10:22.600
too, there was this general hatred and we're talking

10:22.600 --> 10:26.500
like 2010, 2012, there was this general hatred of games

10:26.500 --> 10:29.500
journalists by gamers at the time for being impartial.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.900
And probably the first brush of it was the mass effect

10:32.900 --> 10:37.600
three, um, the mass effect three ending controversy.

10:37.700 --> 10:38.200
Do you remember that?

10:38.200 --> 10:39.000
Did you hear about that at all?

10:40.600 --> 10:41.100
No, I didn't.

10:41.100 --> 10:41.200
Okay.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.400
So what happened?

10:42.700 --> 10:46.700
Let me just, uh, basically mass effect was like a, this

10:46.700 --> 10:49.000
big trilogy on journal, like the on journey, the Xbox

10:49.000 --> 10:55.100
three 60 times and the ending was absolute shit and gamers

10:55.100 --> 10:57.400
got really mad at the game developers and kind of blew

10:57.400 --> 10:58.200
up at them on Twitter.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.600
This is back in again, like 2012 or something.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.500
And if you like, if you search here, let me just pull

11:04.500 --> 11:04.700
this out.

11:04.700 --> 11:05.100
Where is it?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
Where, where, where is it?

11:07.900 --> 11:08.300
Where is it?

11:11.000 --> 11:15.600
Like if you search right now for mass effect three gamer

11:15.600 --> 11:19.100
gate, even though this happened two years before, you

11:19.100 --> 11:21.600
can find people saying that, Oh, this was the beginning

11:22.200 --> 11:24.200
of the same sentiment that caused gamer gate.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.400
You know, these, these gamers wouldn't accept what game

11:27.400 --> 11:29.300
journalists were telling them and what, and what develop

11:29.300 --> 11:31.100
indie developers were telling them and what, you know,

11:31.100 --> 11:32.600
mainstream developers are telling them that they were

11:32.600 --> 11:34.800
just angry and they were reactionary.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.800
And they were these, they didn't use incel cause that

11:37.800 --> 11:40.700
wasn't really a term back then, but, but they would have

11:40.800 --> 11:43.100
cause they used internet virgins, which you can't really

11:43.100 --> 11:44.700
say anymore because that's shaming somebody for their

11:44.700 --> 11:45.300
sexual past.

11:45.700 --> 11:46.900
That's now problematic.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.300
So it was the same kind of idea.

11:50.300 --> 11:54.400
And then there was already this like hatred between your

11:54.400 --> 11:57.100
average gamer who, you know, back then wasn't really popular

11:57.300 --> 11:59.300
games, weren't really that games weren't popular.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.300
People who played them are kind of like derided in their

12:01.300 --> 12:04.500
childhood and they hated these, these, these game journalists.

12:04.500 --> 12:05.200
They already hated them.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.800
So it was already like primed for, for this sort of cultural,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.200
not, not, it's not a rebellion, but it's like a, you know,

12:12.200 --> 12:13.800
we don't, we don't, we're just going to go against you

12:13.800 --> 12:14.400
because we fucking hate you.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.600
It's that, it's that sort of thing, right?

12:15.900 --> 12:16.900
They're already primed for that.

12:17.300 --> 12:22.200
And then when gamer gate happened, you had the two narratives

12:22.200 --> 12:26.900
and the first one was that Zoe Quinn, who was this indie

12:27.100 --> 12:31.400
game developer cheated on her boyfriend and that wasn't

12:31.400 --> 12:34.700
so noteworthy, but she cheated on her boyfriend with five

12:34.700 --> 12:39.800
people who were notable in, in games journalism and that

12:40.100 --> 12:45.700
led to some sort of, some sort of, some sort of like, it's

12:45.700 --> 12:48.400
not toxic, it's like some sort of like, yeah, some sort

12:48.400 --> 12:50.300
of nepotism, some sort of like, like colluded relationship

12:50.300 --> 12:53.600
because earlier Nathan Grayson, one of those guys that,

12:54.000 --> 12:58.400
that had, that had slept with her earlier in the year, he

12:58.400 --> 13:03.000
reported on a game jam that went South involving her and

13:03.000 --> 13:04.300
JonTron was also there.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.700
And JonTron spoken out about this as well, about like his

13:06.700 --> 13:09.600
experiences with like the type of person that Zoe Quinn

13:09.600 --> 13:13.600
is, but basically Zoe Quinn's behavior caused this game

13:13.600 --> 13:18.800
jam to go South and there, and the only like real official

13:18.800 --> 13:20.500
word of what happened there was Nathan Grayson's and

13:20.500 --> 13:21.200
it's like, well, hold on.

13:21.500 --> 13:26.100
Some guy lost like, like, like tens of thousands of dollars

13:26.100 --> 13:29.300
on this project and the only person, the only, the only

13:29.300 --> 13:32.900
person that you're giving the interpretation of events in

13:32.900 --> 13:35.400
the public sphere is the person that you've been having

13:35.400 --> 13:36.700
sex with secretly this whole time.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.000
Well, you know, that sounds like, and also like this guy

13:41.000 --> 13:43.700
who, who hosted this game jam, he got slandered to shit

13:43.700 --> 13:47.100
in the media and he was, he was thinking about like,

13:47.800 --> 13:52.100
like suing these people because his reputation was

13:52.100 --> 13:55.600
destroyed and the guy who destroyed it didn't reveal

13:55.600 --> 13:58.300
that he had sex with, with the other person in the story

13:58.700 --> 14:00.600
who was like his opponent in the story.

14:01.000 --> 14:01.600
You know what I mean?

14:01.700 --> 14:05.600
So it's like, I don't know how actually like in terms

14:05.600 --> 14:08.100
of any, any sort of formal ethics, how unethical it

14:08.100 --> 14:10.600
was, but it certainly felt unethical, especially

14:10.600 --> 14:11.700
because they tried to hide it.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.600
That was the worst part is that they tried to hide it.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.700
Um, so there was, there were these five people and

14:17.700 --> 14:20.220
actually I was heavily involved in, in gamer

14:20.220 --> 14:21.000
gate when it happened.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.200
Um, gamer gate was when my channel went from like

14:24.200 --> 14:28.700
2000 subs to about 15 or 30,000 subs over the course

14:28.700 --> 14:29.500
of like four months.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.900
So like I got my first big bump from them, you

14:31.900 --> 14:33.500
know, before, like before gamer gate, I had done

14:33.500 --> 14:35.800
some anime reviews in like the, that guy with the

14:35.800 --> 14:37.400
glasses channel, awesome style that didn't work

14:37.400 --> 14:39.000
out, did some let's plays that was going like,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.300
okay, but I did some gamer gate videos and that's

14:41.300 --> 14:42.600
when I started doing politics content.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.900
That's when I, that's when I met Sargon, that's

14:44.900 --> 14:46.600
when I met like a bunch of like, you know, arch

14:46.600 --> 14:48.900
Warhammer, that's when I met V, you know, um, a

14:48.900 --> 14:50.100
bunch, a bunch of people that I hang around with

14:50.100 --> 14:50.800
now that I'm still friends with them.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.400
I met them through gamer gate initially.

14:53.700 --> 14:57.600
Um, so the, the one interpretation of events

14:57.800 --> 14:59.300
is that she was sleeping with these five guys

14:59.300 --> 15:01.600
and that led to some sort of incestuous

15:01.600 --> 15:04.900
relationship there where, you know, the, the,

15:04.900 --> 15:07.500
the game journalist scene and the indie game

15:07.500 --> 15:09.500
scene, it was all kind of a big clique, you know,

15:09.500 --> 15:10.900
it's a big club and you're not in it.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.800
And then you had people on the outside who were

15:13.000 --> 15:14.400
generally just regular gamers who were

15:14.400 --> 15:15.000
pissed about it.

15:15.700 --> 15:19.000
And then the other narrative is that it's

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
a harassment campaign and that it's all about

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
sexism and that the only reason you're mad about

15:23.000 --> 15:24.740
Zoe Quinn sleeping with these guys is because

15:24.740 --> 15:26.300
you hate women's sexuality.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.200
You hate women, you know, you're, you're

15:28.200 --> 15:31.000
harassing these women and so on and so forth.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.900
And there was definitely some harassment for

15:32.900 --> 15:34.700
sure, like I can't just sit here and say it was

15:34.700 --> 15:36.600
all sunshine and rainbows and everyone had like

15:36.600 --> 15:38.900
the, the, you know, the most, the most moral

15:38.900 --> 15:39.600
reason to be there.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.900
I definitely saw some harassment of a random

15:41.900 --> 15:44.100
woman, but I also saw a lot of good work done

15:44.100 --> 15:46.400
too, in terms of uncovering, um, the

15:46.400 --> 15:47.100
corruption of people.

15:48.400 --> 15:53.500
Um, I spoke at one point to Zoe Quinn's ex, um,

15:53.500 --> 15:56.700
is, is Aaron, is Aaron Joni or Goni or something?

15:56.800 --> 15:57.600
I can't remember his last name.

15:58.500 --> 15:58.600
Yeah.

15:59.100 --> 15:59.300
Yeah.

15:59.600 --> 16:02.200
I spoke to him privately, uh, at one point,

16:02.200 --> 16:04.400
this was back in 2014 and he said, listen, you

16:04.400 --> 16:05.900
know, they're trying to make it, this was like

16:05.900 --> 16:08.000
in the, like the, like the early, the early weeks,

16:08.000 --> 16:09.500
like two weeks in, like one weekend or something

16:09.500 --> 16:10.200
to the controversy.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.000
And he said, listen, they're trying to make

16:12.000 --> 16:14.100
it a sexism issue.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.400
They're probably going to succeed in making it

16:16.400 --> 16:18.300
a story about sexism because they have the

16:18.300 --> 16:19.000
institutional power.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.900
They have the, they have the outlets they have,

16:21.900 --> 16:24.900
you know, when, you know, when, when, when big,

16:25.400 --> 16:27.500
let's say, you know, something like CNN or

16:27.500 --> 16:29.500
Forbes or whoever, like these, these bigger

16:29.500 --> 16:33.000
outlets, when they report on, um, on, on like

16:33.000 --> 16:35.400
a small hobby, like gaming or any other hobby,

16:35.700 --> 16:37.000
they go to the enthusiast press.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.500
So CNN will actually say, what is Kotaku saying?

16:39.500 --> 16:41.400
Even though Kotaku is a shit rag, they are

16:41.400 --> 16:42.800
the main enthusiast press.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.800
They will, they will at least see what other

16:44.800 --> 16:47.400
journalists are saying in, in that smaller press

16:47.400 --> 16:48.500
to, when, when they report on something

16:48.500 --> 16:49.200
that makes it big.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.900
So Aaron basically said, they're probably

16:51.900 --> 16:54.000
going to succeed in making it all about sexism.

16:54.100 --> 16:58.000
But what you need to do is ignore, like there

16:58.000 --> 16:59.100
are people out there who were talking about,

16:59.400 --> 17:00.400
who were talking about how much of a, how

17:00.400 --> 17:01.400
much of a slut Zoe is.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.900
That's, that's not the issue here.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.100
The issue is that you need to look at what

17:05.100 --> 17:06.800
these people are actually doing.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.040
And my biggest contribution to

17:09.040 --> 17:10.100
Gamergate personally.

17:10.900 --> 17:17.700
Um, and I, it was the, it sounds weird.

17:17.700 --> 17:18.900
It sounds weird to say, it sounds like I'm

17:18.900 --> 17:20.000
really blowing myself up here.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.640
It wasn't that big of a deal, but it sounds

17:21.640 --> 17:25.180
like it was basically an, uh, ending

17:25.180 --> 17:26.180
Phil Fish's career.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.740
And it had, and that event had nothing to

17:29.740 --> 17:31.040
do with sexism whatsoever.

17:31.340 --> 17:33.040
There weren't even any women involved in that event.

17:33.940 --> 17:34.240
Yeah.

17:34.340 --> 17:36.840
Um, basically what happened, what I did,

17:36.840 --> 17:38.340
that this, this was my big contribution.

17:38.340 --> 17:39.380
Like other people did other things, you

17:39.380 --> 17:40.600
know, internet, Mr.

17:40.600 --> 17:41.580
Medica, he was digging up stuff.

17:41.580 --> 17:42.500
Sargon was digging up stuff.

17:42.940 --> 17:46.300
What, um, me and my friends dug up was that

17:47.140 --> 17:50.400
early in Gamergate, somebody at Phil Fish's

17:50.400 --> 17:53.760
company, Polytron, leaked their financial

17:53.760 --> 17:57.140
documents to 4chan, all their internal

17:57.140 --> 17:57.900
financial documents.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.600
It's probably very illegal to actually

17:59.600 --> 18:00.740
have a copy of these because they're

18:00.740 --> 18:01.500
considered classified.

18:02.600 --> 18:03.860
Um, but I got a copy of them.

18:05.140 --> 18:07.300
Um, and there was three of us on the channel

18:07.300 --> 18:08.640
at the time, and we kind of sat down and we

18:08.640 --> 18:10.400
looked through them and we discovered in the

18:10.400 --> 18:12.840
financial documents that a bunch of people who

18:12.840 --> 18:15.340
had invested in Polytron.

18:16.060 --> 18:17.540
So they had put some people put up like

18:17.540 --> 18:19.900
$5,000 and people put up 10,000, 20,000.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.260
You know, people put up these chunks of money

18:22.260 --> 18:23.800
to own parts of Polytron.

18:24.300 --> 18:28.560
These same people, they, um, they were also

18:28.560 --> 18:30.860
judges at the Independent Games Festival.

18:32.900 --> 18:36.960
And they were judges when the Polytron's

18:36.960 --> 18:41.500
only game Fez won awards at, and during

18:41.500 --> 18:44.160
two different years, the whole idea of the

18:44.160 --> 18:45.940
IGF, the rules are basically, listen, you

18:45.940 --> 18:48.200
can, you put forward a game for awards.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.840
You can win, you know, game of the year.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.640
You can win best sound design, best control,

18:51.640 --> 18:52.900
best graphics, whatever, all you have, all

18:52.900 --> 18:53.480
the awards, right?

18:53.780 --> 18:55.540
But you can only put forward a game once you

18:55.540 --> 18:58.700
put, you put it forward when the game launches

18:58.900 --> 19:01.700
and Fez launched in 2012, but it won best

19:01.700 --> 19:03.100
sound design in 2008.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.700
And it won a few other, like a few other awards

19:05.700 --> 19:06.600
in 2008 as well.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.540
And then at one game of the year in 2012, back

19:09.540 --> 19:11.800
in 2012, they said, listen, listen, it's

19:11.800 --> 19:13.740
completely fine that it won two sets of awards

19:13.740 --> 19:15.700
because we consider Fez's demo to be a different

19:15.700 --> 19:16.600
game than Fez itself.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.900
That was the only game that the IGF ever did

19:18.900 --> 19:20.540
that for no one ever understood why.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.100
Um, but then we realized two years later

19:23.100 --> 19:24.440
during gamer gate, after we got a hold of the

19:24.440 --> 19:26.600
financial documents that the judges, the people

19:26.600 --> 19:28.340
at the IGF were the same people who invested

19:28.340 --> 19:29.500
in the company that put out Fez.

19:30.740 --> 19:32.500
And so they stood to profit from increased

19:32.500 --> 19:33.400
valuation of the company.

19:33.700 --> 19:33.960
Yeah.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.160
So I put this into a video, we edit it

19:36.160 --> 19:37.200
together, we put it out.

19:37.660 --> 19:40.100
Um, the video goes fucking gangbusters.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.300
It got like 500,000 views in like 30

19:43.300 --> 19:43.960
minutes or something.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.160
Like it was, it was going wild.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.160
Um, and then Phil Fish sent me a cease

19:48.160 --> 19:50.860
and desist, and he said, you need to

19:50.860 --> 19:52.160
fucking take this video down right now.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.000
Or else I'm going to sue you.

19:53.060 --> 19:55.560
And I was, uh, I was nine years younger,

19:55.860 --> 19:58.160
just out of university, had no backbone, no

19:58.160 --> 19:59.820
fucking clue if YouTube would work out or not.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.700
I had no money, no nothing.

20:02.020 --> 20:02.620
So I took it down.

20:03.460 --> 20:05.520
Um, I put it back up a few months later and

20:05.520 --> 20:06.400
it's still up on my channel.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.200
You can go back and watch it.

20:07.760 --> 20:12.120
All the evidence is in the video, but, um, the

20:12.120 --> 20:15.020
fact that it was up for like an hour and then

20:15.020 --> 20:17.000
it went down and then like mirrors of it

20:17.000 --> 20:19.240
started popping up and it started going viral

20:19.240 --> 20:21.560
on Twitter and everyone was talking about this

20:21.560 --> 20:22.900
big revelation of Phil Fish.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.460
Um, the next day, and this is still in the

20:26.460 --> 20:27.700
archives of their site too.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.860
Cause I, I actually made a little, a short

20:29.860 --> 20:31.660
video describing what happened with me and

20:31.660 --> 20:34.000
Phil Fish, just to, just to kind of update new,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.200
my new viewers in the old lore.

20:35.560 --> 20:39.540
Um, on the IGFs website, you can see.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.140
So they're like, uh, so you might've seen

20:42.140 --> 20:44.300
recently some weird, some weird allegations,

20:44.300 --> 20:45.940
but we've investigated ourselves and discovered

20:45.940 --> 20:46.760
that we did nothing wrong.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.920
It was one of those like very boilerplate

20:48.920 --> 20:49.560
statements, right?

20:50.160 --> 20:52.260
So no one fucking trusted these guys anymore.

20:52.420 --> 20:54.020
Since then, no one's really cared about what

20:54.020 --> 20:55.760
the IGF has, has, has done.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.960
They've been like in a slow decline and Phil

20:57.960 --> 21:00.660
Fish hasn't released a game since, since

21:00.660 --> 21:03.320
gamer gate, he, he, he just left the internet.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.160
He left the internet, he left indie gaming.

21:05.160 --> 21:05.720
He left all of it.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.920
And you know, now I'm 135,000 subs, which

21:09.920 --> 21:11.800
isn't, which isn't small, but it's not big,

21:11.860 --> 21:13.660
but it's big enough that some people know who I

21:13.660 --> 21:16.460
am and I've basically heard from people who

21:16.920 --> 21:18.960
who, you know, are games journalists who

21:18.960 --> 21:21.060
watch me, who are game developers who watch

21:21.060 --> 21:22.720
me, you know, the, the, there, there are

21:22.720 --> 21:23.820
people who have like messaged me and said,

21:23.820 --> 21:24.960
listen, you can't reveal who I am.

21:24.960 --> 21:25.660
I'll lose my job.

21:25.860 --> 21:28.520
But just so you know, no one wants to work

21:28.520 --> 21:29.420
with Phil Fish anymore.

21:29.620 --> 21:30.520
And that's why he's gone.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.520
Wow.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.620
And I've heard that from like about five

21:33.620 --> 21:36.660
different people now that he's, he's just, he,

21:36.920 --> 21:38.560
I, I basically nuked his career.

21:39.960 --> 21:40.960
Holy shit.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.220
How does that feel?

21:42.660 --> 21:44.960
It feels, it feels pretty good.

21:45.660 --> 21:47.520
I mean, like, like no one likes the whole

21:47.520 --> 21:49.660
cancel culture thing, but like, this was

21:49.660 --> 21:50.320
actual corruption.

21:50.360 --> 21:52.560
This was not like, Oh, you, you have a mean

21:52.560 --> 21:54.760
tweet where you said the N word 10 years ago.

21:54.760 --> 21:55.620
So we're going to get, we're going to get you

21:55.620 --> 21:56.860
fired from your wagey job.

21:56.860 --> 21:58.200
But that wasn't that, this is something

21:58.200 --> 22:00.000
different, you know, this is somebody who

22:00.000 --> 22:01.260
actually behaved inappropriately.

22:01.420 --> 22:05.160
And the thing is, none of this story has

22:05.160 --> 22:08.220
anything to do with sexism or harassment

22:08.220 --> 22:08.820
whatsoever.

22:10.860 --> 22:13.920
So, so they're, they're definitely, you

22:13.920 --> 22:16.820
know, if there is a side to gamer gate that

22:16.820 --> 22:18.420
wasn't about that, at the very least, it was

22:18.420 --> 22:20.280
me, I can personally confirm that I wasn't

22:20.280 --> 22:20.880
part of that stuff.

22:21.580 --> 22:21.820
Yeah.

22:22.080 --> 22:25.280
Um, I don't think Sargon was either from all

22:25.280 --> 22:26.620
that I, from all that I know of him, he doesn't

22:26.620 --> 22:27.180
seem like the type.

22:28.220 --> 22:33.720
Um, however, like in just, just to prepare

22:33.720 --> 22:35.460
for this, I went back and watched a bit of

22:35.460 --> 22:36.020
my old videos.

22:36.020 --> 22:37.760
Oh God, they're so hard to watch, man.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.980
Like the shittiest mic, the shittiest audio

22:39.980 --> 22:41.060
quality was 2014.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.380
I had no fucking clue, you know, but, um,

22:43.380 --> 22:44.780
I went back and watched some of them and

22:44.780 --> 22:46.940
even like in my second gamer gate video, I

22:46.940 --> 22:49.180
was like, listen, I have seen some harassment.

22:49.180 --> 22:50.280
You guys got to cut the shit out.

22:50.280 --> 22:50.580
All right.

22:50.580 --> 22:52.840
Where we're trying to discover that these

22:52.840 --> 22:54.280
people are actually really fucking corrupt.

22:54.280 --> 22:54.940
You got to cut this out.

22:54.940 --> 22:57.980
So even back then I was, I was a bit of a don't

22:57.980 --> 22:59.680
harass people kind of cuck.

22:59.880 --> 23:00.480
You know what I mean?

23:01.280 --> 23:01.580
Yeah.

23:04.340 --> 23:04.980
Interesting.

23:05.540 --> 23:06.140
That's what I did.

23:06.940 --> 23:09.440
That's what I did personally, but in terms

23:09.440 --> 23:12.740
of gamer gate as a whole, um, man, there's

23:12.840 --> 23:13.840
so much like old lore.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.340
I was, I was talking to Chud Logic about

23:15.340 --> 23:17.440
this in private a few days ago.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.240
You wanted to try and arrange a conversation

23:20.240 --> 23:22.900
between me and Brianna Wu because she was very

23:22.900 --> 23:24.840
like anti gamer gate, like one of the most

23:24.840 --> 23:26.240
vocal anti gamer gate people.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.200
And I'm like, you can do that Chud, but I

23:29.200 --> 23:32.380
have old evidence from back in the day that

23:32.380 --> 23:34.200
Brianna Wu faked her own harassment.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.000
I've been sitting on it for nine

23:36.000 --> 23:37.040
fucking years, Chud.

23:37.400 --> 23:38.800
We can, we can do this if you want, but

23:38.800 --> 23:40.140
it's not going to end well for her.

23:40.740 --> 23:41.200
Wow.

23:41.940 --> 23:42.240
Yeah.

23:43.740 --> 23:44.500
Let's see if I can dig it up for you.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.300
If you want to see it, hold on.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.900
Let me go into the, the Chud DMS real quick.

23:49.100 --> 23:50.440
And so I don't know if that conversation

23:50.440 --> 23:51.740
is going to happen or not.

23:51.800 --> 23:52.540
Yeah.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.100
Holy moly.

23:55.140 --> 23:56.100
Let's see here.

23:56.140 --> 23:57.040
I'm going to scroll up.

23:57.140 --> 23:58.540
Chud and I talk a fair amount, so it's

23:58.540 --> 24:00.700
kind of deep in the DMS now.

24:01.300 --> 24:01.700
Yeah.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.140
Um, and it seems like, uh, you know, the,

24:08.140 --> 24:12.300
the reputation of these, uh, game gaming,

24:12.300 --> 24:15.100
like journalists, journalism, you know,

24:15.100 --> 24:17.800
sites and platforms or whatever, um,

24:17.840 --> 24:19.440
haven't really improved.

24:19.460 --> 24:21.660
Like for the most part, everybody still

24:21.660 --> 24:25.000
thinks that Kotaku is, you know, shit.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.100
Everybody still thinks that, um, it just

24:28.100 --> 24:30.400
seems like, it seems like for the most

24:30.400 --> 24:33.300
part, people still don't trust, uh, these

24:33.300 --> 24:34.260
like reporters.

24:35.340 --> 24:35.560
Yeah.

24:35.560 --> 24:36.600
Well, the issue is they never like

24:36.600 --> 24:37.640
came out and apologized.

24:38.040 --> 24:40.140
I remember Medeker saying like a week or

24:40.380 --> 24:42.540
two in that if they just said, listen, yeah,

24:42.540 --> 24:43.540
we fucked up, we're sorry.

24:43.540 --> 24:44.440
We won't do it again.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.540
I think everyone had forgiven them, but

24:46.540 --> 24:47.140
they still haven't.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.640
They said, it's about sexism.

24:48.680 --> 24:49.740
It's only about sexism.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.740
If you imply that it's about anything other

24:51.740 --> 24:53.100
than sexism, you're a sexist.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.740
So like, because that was, there was, there

24:56.740 --> 25:00.940
was just this, this, this hegemonic, um, you

25:00.940 --> 25:03.640
know, circling of the wagons where it's like,

25:03.680 --> 25:04.680
this was the narrative.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.180
If you disagreed, you were a sexist.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.880
And then two years later it became racist.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.080
And two years later it became fascist.

25:10.220 --> 25:11.980
This is kind of where that, that whole

25:12.280 --> 25:14.420
radicalization of the Overton window started

25:14.420 --> 25:16.080
was, I think, I think that's what started

25:16.080 --> 25:17.080
it was what was a gamer gate.

25:17.420 --> 25:18.580
I don't think that like gamer gate

25:18.580 --> 25:19.780
caused Trump or Brexit.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.880
I think that gamer gate started a slow

25:22.880 --> 25:25.220
media radicalization that contributed to

25:25.220 --> 25:26.540
those two events later.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.740
And is now why we're, we're living in like

25:28.740 --> 25:30.880
a media hellscape where people are getting

25:30.880 --> 25:32.980
canceled over 10 year old tweets and fucking

25:32.980 --> 25:34.620
like everything is the most possible woke.

25:34.620 --> 25:35.580
And it's just ridiculous.

25:35.980 --> 25:37.720
You know, it makes sense that also that's

25:37.720 --> 25:39.860
the start of when people stop trusting,

25:40.220 --> 25:42.120
um, like media, right.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.460
They stopped trusting media.

25:43.460 --> 25:45.480
They stopped trusting mainstream media.

25:45.780 --> 25:48.580
Um, and for a good reason, and we can

25:48.580 --> 25:51.160
still see people are very skeptical of

25:51.160 --> 25:52.580
mainstream media today.

25:53.060 --> 25:55.780
Um, so I think it very much is related.

25:55.780 --> 25:56.180
Yeah.

25:58.220 --> 25:58.420
Okay.

25:58.420 --> 26:01.080
Regarding, we're going to woo, check out,

26:01.080 --> 26:01.580
check this out.

26:01.960 --> 26:02.860
You can, this is not something

26:02.860 --> 26:03.460
that's been doctored.

26:03.460 --> 26:04.660
You can find this all over the internet.

26:04.660 --> 26:05.820
This is old deep lore.

26:06.060 --> 26:06.960
I just DMed it to you.

26:07.420 --> 26:08.900
So pull that up and let me know

26:08.900 --> 26:10.060
what it looks like to you.

26:10.820 --> 26:11.760
It looks like a tweet.

26:12.300 --> 26:12.500
Yeah.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.700
Uh, and, uh, chat can't see this.

26:16.160 --> 26:16.660
Um,

26:16.760 --> 26:17.700
Oh, I can't see it.

26:18.360 --> 26:19.600
Uh, should I show it to chat?

26:19.620 --> 26:20.060
Do you want me to show it?

26:20.060 --> 26:20.220
Yeah, sure.

26:20.220 --> 26:20.620
Yeah, go ahead.

26:20.700 --> 26:21.200
Yeah, go ahead.

26:21.500 --> 26:21.800
All right.

26:21.860 --> 26:23.720
One, let me share it.

26:28.860 --> 26:29.320
Okay.

26:29.360 --> 26:30.620
It says, and here's the part of the

26:30.620 --> 26:32.260
night where I call the police.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.800
Um, and it's like a quote, tweet of

26:35.360 --> 26:36.420
death to Brianna.

26:36.460 --> 26:38.080
I've got a K bar and I'm coming to your

26:38.080 --> 26:40.020
house so I can shove it up your ugly

26:40.060 --> 26:40.980
feminist con.

26:41.720 --> 26:41.920
Yeah.

26:43.320 --> 26:47.880
Look at the, um, when that

26:47.880 --> 26:48.920
other tweet was posted.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.880
So this was 19 seconds.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.380
19 seconds earlier.

26:54.980 --> 26:55.360
Yeah.

26:55.420 --> 26:58.420
So what is, what are the chances that

26:58.420 --> 27:00.980
Brianna Wu saw this in 19 seconds

27:00.980 --> 27:01.780
and then tweeted about it?

27:03.820 --> 27:05.160
Um, I don't know.

27:05.960 --> 27:08.600
What, what are the, what are the odds?

27:09.360 --> 27:11.700
It seems a bit more likely that maybe

27:11.700 --> 27:12.820
this might be her sock account.

27:14.060 --> 27:16.620
Because to find a tweet in seconds

27:16.620 --> 27:18.360
was unheard of back in 2014.

27:18.560 --> 27:20.200
It took several minutes to push those up.

27:21.000 --> 27:21.200
Yeah.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.000
And she must've been getting a lot of,

27:23.060 --> 27:24.660
um, she may, it must've been getting a

27:24.660 --> 27:26.820
lot of notifications as well back then.

27:26.820 --> 27:27.300
Yeah.

27:27.560 --> 27:27.800
Yeah.

27:28.500 --> 27:28.660
Yeah.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.620
Uh, but even that, that is, um, let's

27:32.620 --> 27:35.120
see, that's a bit less con that's a bit

27:35.120 --> 27:36.920
less ironclad because, you know, maybe

27:36.920 --> 27:38.060
she did actually see it in 19 seconds.

27:38.060 --> 27:38.320
Who knows?

27:38.320 --> 27:38.460
Right.

27:38.460 --> 27:38.820
Who knows?

27:39.060 --> 27:41.060
But notice in that tweet, her that's

27:41.060 --> 27:42.260
her old name, space cat gal.

27:42.260 --> 27:43.760
That was like the name of her game company

27:43.760 --> 27:45.520
back before she, when she was making games.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.060
Um, okay.

27:47.420 --> 27:49.960
This is also old lore, not doctored.

27:50.020 --> 27:51.060
Many people can confirm this.

27:52.560 --> 27:55.680
This one is a picture of the discussions

27:55.680 --> 28:02.660
page on her game on steam where she

28:02.660 --> 28:06.000
accidentally posts harassment to herself

28:06.500 --> 28:09.160
under her own name, forgetting to log

28:09.160 --> 28:12.200
out and log into her, her, her sock account.

28:14.700 --> 28:17.160
If PSX had a development and noted feminist

28:17.160 --> 28:20.660
Brianna Wu, a terrible person, um, 8chan

28:20.660 --> 28:22.360
gamer gate and Kotaku in action,

28:22.360 --> 28:23.560
knock yourselves out.

28:24.460 --> 28:25.400
And okay.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.920
So she's the poster.

28:27.160 --> 28:27.400
Yeah.

28:30.060 --> 28:30.600
Yeah.

28:30.660 --> 28:31.140
Oof.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.760
That's like very cringe.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.300
That's a cringe moment for sure.

28:34.300 --> 28:35.960
What did she have to say about it?

28:36.500 --> 28:37.760
She has never once talked

28:37.760 --> 28:38.640
about this in public.

28:39.960 --> 28:41.400
She has always ignored it when it comes up.

28:43.360 --> 28:43.940
Wow.

28:45.300 --> 28:46.660
I don't think, I don't think anyone's like

28:46.660 --> 28:48.540
talked to her about it in a panel or anything,

28:49.040 --> 28:50.040
uh, or in an interview.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.300
And whenever someone like, like messages

28:52.300 --> 28:53.700
her on Twitter, she just ignores it.

28:53.700 --> 28:54.660
She just doesn't reply.

28:54.840 --> 28:55.500
This is something that she

28:55.500 --> 28:56.660
has just tried to bury.

28:57.400 --> 28:57.840
Yeah.

28:58.900 --> 28:59.340
Wow.

28:59.500 --> 28:59.960
Okay.

29:00.460 --> 29:03.660
It reminds me of, uh, oh, who was it?

29:04.260 --> 29:05.720
Was it Stefan Molyneux who did it where

29:05.720 --> 29:07.560
he like, he's like, he, he, he replies to

29:07.560 --> 29:09.220
his own video and somewhere where he's

29:09.220 --> 29:11.220
like, I'm actually like a black woman.

29:11.220 --> 29:13.220
And I remember that fuck.

29:13.220 --> 29:13.960
That was ridiculous.

29:14.420 --> 29:14.820
Yeah.

29:14.860 --> 29:15.520
Oh, that's what it was.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.420
Oh fuck.

29:16.660 --> 29:18.260
It reminds it's, it's exactly like that.

29:18.260 --> 29:21.220
And it's like, man, guys, guys, how, how

29:21.220 --> 29:23.620
is it that you're like, if you're so

29:23.620 --> 29:27.200
desperate, like how could the narrative

29:27.200 --> 29:28.300
is that these people are being harassed

29:28.300 --> 29:29.600
so much, why do you have to fake it?

29:29.600 --> 29:30.600
If you're being harassed that much?

29:31.600 --> 29:32.040
Yeah.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.360
Um, somebody in chat says, start, could

29:34.360 --> 29:35.760
it not just be that she was trying

29:35.760 --> 29:37.660
to get feedback on herself?

29:38.160 --> 29:39.860
I mean, yeah, if we wanted to be like

29:39.860 --> 29:41.500
super, if we wanted to be the most

29:41.500 --> 29:45.360
charitable possible, maybe, but then why

29:45.360 --> 29:47.000
wouldn't she just say that, I guess, why

29:47.000 --> 29:48.600
wouldn't she just address it and say that

29:48.600 --> 29:49.060
much?

29:49.860 --> 29:50.160
Yeah.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.140
If you really want to steal a minute, it

29:53.140 --> 29:57.660
does maybe read like she's being, she's

29:57.660 --> 29:59.920
like self-flagellating here, but I don't

29:59.920 --> 30:00.320
think so.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.060
I don't think so.

30:01.120 --> 30:01.400
Yeah.

30:02.320 --> 30:02.600
Yeah.

30:03.120 --> 30:03.320
Yeah.

30:03.600 --> 30:04.600
And the fact that she wouldn't talk

30:04.600 --> 30:05.100
about it later.

30:05.100 --> 30:05.400
Yeah.

30:05.720 --> 30:05.920
Yeah.

30:05.960 --> 30:06.260
Yeah.

30:06.920 --> 30:09.100
I mean, yeah, it's easy to just be like,

30:09.100 --> 30:11.000
yeah, I was looking for feedback on myself

30:11.000 --> 30:13.660
or I was feeling, you know, um, a certain

30:13.660 --> 30:15.220
type of way or something like that.

30:15.260 --> 30:15.520
Wow.

30:15.560 --> 30:15.720
Yep.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.220
I was in an, in a depressive spiral or

30:17.220 --> 30:19.460
something, but nope, she just ignores it.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.020
And she has for nine years now.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.660
So, yeah.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.020
Um, so yeah, that's, that's the

30:26.020 --> 30:27.120
Brianna Wu stuff.

30:27.180 --> 30:29.220
Uh, there's something else I wanted to

30:29.220 --> 30:30.980
bring up what we're talking about right

30:30.980 --> 30:31.580
before Brianna Wu.

30:31.580 --> 30:32.080
Do you remember?

30:33.380 --> 30:35.880
Uh, we were talking about how you ended,

30:35.880 --> 30:40.320
um, uh, yeah, Phil Fish's career.

30:40.320 --> 30:40.620
Yeah.

30:40.860 --> 30:42.580
I mean, I like, I put up like, like a

30:42.580 --> 30:44.980
TikTok it's like two minutes long that

30:44.980 --> 30:46.180
kind of describes the whole thing, but

30:46.180 --> 30:47.280
you mean you already heard me describe it.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.480
It just shows a few screenshots of what

30:48.480 --> 30:48.820
happened.

30:48.960 --> 30:49.580
It's not a big deal.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.520
Um, shit.

30:54.820 --> 30:55.980
Oh, yes.

30:56.540 --> 30:58.620
Do you remember the, the gamers are

30:58.620 --> 30:59.480
dead part of it?

31:00.780 --> 31:01.340
I don't.

31:01.880 --> 31:02.040
Okay.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.180
Let me just here.

31:03.740 --> 31:05.040
I'm going to the know your meme page

31:05.040 --> 31:05.180
here.

31:05.180 --> 31:06.420
I'll link this to you just so you could

31:06.420 --> 31:08.580
read it later if you like, because the

31:08.580 --> 31:10.020
know your meme page and the Wikipedia

31:10.020 --> 31:11.140
page are good for the book are good for

31:11.140 --> 31:11.740
the two sides.

31:12.540 --> 31:15.320
Um, let's see.

31:18.520 --> 31:20.980
Let me just control effort.

31:22.920 --> 31:23.140
Oops.

31:24.980 --> 31:25.480
Oh, it's out here.

31:26.240 --> 31:26.720
It doesn't matter.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.680
This is one of those, another one of

31:27.680 --> 31:28.920
those images you can just find just by

31:28.920 --> 31:29.980
searching gamers are dead.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.880
It's yep.

31:34.920 --> 31:35.380
Here it is.

31:36.480 --> 31:36.980
Oh, come on.

31:36.980 --> 31:40.740
Why is it like 300 pixels wide guys?

31:43.240 --> 31:44.080
Give me the original.

31:46.240 --> 31:46.580
Hold on.

31:46.980 --> 31:47.640
Hold on just a second.

31:50.420 --> 31:50.820
Okay.

31:51.120 --> 31:51.380
Yeah.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.120
So this happened about one week after

31:54.120 --> 31:55.340
the Zoe post dropped.

31:55.480 --> 31:55.880
Okay.

31:56.980 --> 31:58.540
Uh, here, I'm going to post, I'm going

31:58.540 --> 31:59.280
to give you this image here.

32:00.380 --> 32:01.740
So this ha this happened about one

32:01.740 --> 32:03.840
week after the Zoe post dropped and there

32:03.840 --> 32:06.180
was this huge, you know, consumer backlash.

32:07.980 --> 32:12.440
All of these gaming sites put forward

32:12.440 --> 32:14.940
articles saying gamers are dead.

32:15.020 --> 32:15.680
Gamers are over.

32:15.740 --> 32:17.940
It's the end of the gamer gaming is

32:17.940 --> 32:19.940
leaving gamers behind the identity of

32:19.940 --> 32:22.440
gamer is, is done is gone.

32:22.480 --> 32:22.940
That's it.

32:23.940 --> 32:24.280
All right.

32:25.020 --> 32:25.320
All right.

32:26.180 --> 32:27.280
And they all came out like within

32:27.280 --> 32:28.020
an hour of each other.

32:28.740 --> 32:29.140
Yeah.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.880
And so, so total biscuit, who I think

32:32.920 --> 32:33.980
he was, he was still alive at the time.

32:33.980 --> 32:35.420
He didn't die till I think 2017, right?

32:35.780 --> 32:36.440
Total biscuit.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.680
He said, he, he, he famously said on

32:38.680 --> 32:41.340
Twitter, I've never seen anything like this.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.820
I've never seen anything like this level of

32:45.140 --> 32:46.920
coordination or collaboration.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.320
And all of these articles talked about

32:49.680 --> 32:52.220
how Anita Sarkeesian was, um, was getting

32:52.220 --> 32:53.820
harassment due to this, how Brianna

32:53.860 --> 32:55.660
Wu was getting harassment to this, due

32:55.660 --> 32:59.180
to this, how the path forward for, for

32:59.180 --> 33:01.960
progress in the games industry was for

33:02.520 --> 33:04.920
journalists and independent game developers

33:05.060 --> 33:07.260
to no longer consider gamers to be their

33:07.260 --> 33:10.220
audience and to say, yeah, you have a group

33:10.220 --> 33:12.480
of people who are, you know, they're pretty

33:12.480 --> 33:14.120
socially, not, not that well adjusted.

33:14.380 --> 33:15.620
They're kind of maligned, they're kind of

33:15.620 --> 33:18.060
nerdy and you know, and then, and the only

33:18.060 --> 33:19.780
thing they really have as in terms of a

33:19.780 --> 33:22.380
collective identity is gamer as you know,

33:22.480 --> 33:24.940
as in celly as that sounds, when you have

33:24.940 --> 33:27.840
the enthusiast press attacking them like

33:27.840 --> 33:29.240
this, it doesn't go over well.

33:29.880 --> 33:30.980
That's got a lot of people angry.

33:31.580 --> 33:33.640
People were very, very angry when this

33:33.640 --> 33:33.940
happened.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.820
Um, yeah, that, yeah, it looks sus.

33:39.820 --> 33:41.820
It just looks so, so, I mean, not even

33:41.820 --> 33:44.220
sus, it just looks like, you know,

33:44.380 --> 33:46.880
conclusive that all of these people are

33:47.620 --> 33:49.680
coordinated, um, essentially.

33:49.920 --> 33:51.720
So there, there's no doubt about it.

33:52.080 --> 33:52.360
Yeah.

33:53.120 --> 33:53.420
Yeah.

33:53.820 --> 33:55.760
And then it came out, uh, three or

33:55.760 --> 33:59.360
four months later, there was, uh, a game

33:59.360 --> 34:02.880
journalist named Billy D who ran a website

34:02.880 --> 34:03.960
called one angry gamer.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.960
He was part of a Google group called game

34:06.960 --> 34:09.520
journal pros, where it turned out that they

34:09.520 --> 34:12.060
were all in there discussing what articles

34:12.060 --> 34:14.780
to publish, what political opinions were

34:14.780 --> 34:17.260
safe to put forward, what you were, what you

34:17.260 --> 34:18.780
should publish on your website, what you

34:18.780 --> 34:19.920
shouldn't publish on your website.

34:20.420 --> 34:21.520
And they were all colluding it.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.620
Um, Billy D gave the information to Milo.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.660
Milo published it on Breitbart and that

34:27.660 --> 34:30.520
was Milo's big, uh, his, his first big

34:30.520 --> 34:33.160
breakaway he took off because of publishing

34:33.480 --> 34:34.260
Billy D's leak.

34:35.160 --> 34:38.220
So Milo was even involved in gamer gate.

34:38.480 --> 34:38.880
Yes.

34:39.220 --> 34:41.860
Milo was, no one had heard of, had heard

34:41.860 --> 34:42.820
of Milo before gamer gate.

34:44.120 --> 34:45.580
Milo was where he blew up, sorry.

34:45.580 --> 34:46.660
Gamer gate was where Milo blew up.

34:47.620 --> 34:48.020
Okay.

34:49.020 --> 34:49.380
Wow.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.380
Um, there you go.

34:52.440 --> 34:53.580
I'm going to try to find the game

34:53.580 --> 34:54.380
journal pros.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.540
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.540
I mean, Oh, there's like a bunch of articles

35:04.540 --> 35:06.820
describing it and like who was on it.

35:07.440 --> 35:09.340
If you search for the, the name game

35:09.340 --> 35:10.440
journal pros, you'll find it.

35:10.480 --> 35:12.380
But like there's a bunch of articles

35:12.380 --> 35:13.680
of describing what happened.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.680
Yeah, I can, I can post you an article, I

35:16.680 --> 35:18.920
guess, but like a lot of this is just, you

35:18.920 --> 35:20.660
know, reading, you know, reading old lore.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.020
Yeah.

35:23.520 --> 35:26.560
But yeah, uh, what was being said and how

35:26.560 --> 35:29.020
things were, were being colluded in game

35:29.020 --> 35:30.060
journal pros was leaked.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.120
Milo was the one who leaked it that

35:32.120 --> 35:33.760
basically made Milo's career.

35:33.880 --> 35:34.820
That's how we got started.

35:35.360 --> 35:38.060
And then he, he moved on to, to, he, he moved

35:38.060 --> 35:40.020
on to bigger things in 2015 with Brexit and

35:40.020 --> 35:42.860
2016 with Trump, but he got started doing

35:42.860 --> 35:43.520
gamer gate stuff.

35:44.620 --> 35:44.960
Wow.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.200
Someone in your chat says as much as

35:47.200 --> 35:48.860
gamer gate went off the rails, this

35:48.860 --> 35:50.060
aspect is indisputable.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.760
They instigated a reaction and then cited

35:52.760 --> 35:54.600
the reaction to justify the instigation.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.260
Yeah, that sounds, that sounds pretty

35:57.260 --> 35:58.400
similar to what happened.

35:58.900 --> 36:02.000
That like a lot of, a lot of the gamers,

36:02.060 --> 36:04.100
like just blew up and a lot of them went

36:04.100 --> 36:06.760
overboard during gamer gate, but they, but

36:06.760 --> 36:08.100
they went overboard because of the, of

36:08.100 --> 36:10.000
the terrible, the consistent, terrible

36:10.000 --> 36:11.200
behavior of all of these people.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.200
And then after that, they went overboard

36:13.200 --> 36:15.300
that's what they use to justify their

36:15.300 --> 36:15.700
behavior.

36:16.100 --> 36:17.400
They said, Oh, well, we, we don't need

36:17.400 --> 36:18.860
to, you know, gamers don't actually need

36:18.860 --> 36:19.860
to be our audience anymore because look

36:19.860 --> 36:20.860
at how they blow up when we insult them.

36:20.940 --> 36:22.500
And it's like, well, okay.

36:23.160 --> 36:23.400
Yeah.

36:26.400 --> 36:26.700
Yeah.

36:26.700 --> 36:27.060
Oh yeah.

36:27.060 --> 36:28.860
I'm seeing it here now in the timeline.

36:31.200 --> 36:34.300
So yeah, the timeline in this time, I'll

36:34.300 --> 36:38.100
link the timeline, but, and you can tell

36:38.100 --> 36:39.600
me how accurate this timeline is.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.700
I think it's, it's, it's, it's, it's

36:41.700 --> 36:43.400
funny how accurate this timeline is.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.500
You know, but this is where it was.

36:47.800 --> 36:51.160
Oh, rational Wiki, but they're also

36:51.160 --> 36:52.100
slanted, but that's fine.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.100
Everyone has their slanted.

36:53.900 --> 36:54.200
Oh yeah.

36:54.760 --> 36:54.960
Yeah.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.100
They're, they're like hyper feminist

36:56.100 --> 36:56.460
actually.

36:57.100 --> 36:57.860
Oh, for real.

36:58.060 --> 36:58.360
Yeah.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.060
I just, I was looking at it because it's

37:01.060 --> 37:03.140
like the most comprehensive timeline I

37:03.140 --> 37:05.300
could find, but if there's a better one

37:05.300 --> 37:06.340
around, you know, I'm

37:06.800 --> 37:08.460
know your meme, know your memes page is

37:08.460 --> 37:10.300
pretty good on it too, but it's from a

37:10.300 --> 37:11.500
completely different political point of

37:11.500 --> 37:11.660
view.

37:12.000 --> 37:12.200
Yeah.

37:12.400 --> 37:12.800
Okay.

37:13.800 --> 37:14.400
Let's see here.

37:14.460 --> 37:16.300
I'm just going to quickly skim it.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.360
So yeah, I see this.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.000
Um,

37:30.200 --> 37:32.100
mundane Matt publishes the Zoe post

37:32.400 --> 37:33.600
not August 16th.

37:33.700 --> 37:34.000
Yep.

37:42.700 --> 37:44.300
Yeah, there's, there's deep lore of

37:44.300 --> 37:47.400
like, of all these people involved, man.

37:47.500 --> 37:50.300
Like, so there's somebody that Zoe Quinn

37:50.300 --> 37:52.200
drove to suicide completely unrelated

37:52.200 --> 37:53.800
to gamer gate, you know, like all of

37:53.800 --> 37:55.100
these people have a history that would

37:55.200 --> 37:56.800
that, that can serve as its own video

37:57.200 --> 37:58.200
independent from what they've done with

37:58.200 --> 37:58.600
gamer gate.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.500
Um, yeah, somebody in chat was mentioning

38:02.500 --> 38:05.800
that, um, Alec Holoka.

38:06.200 --> 38:06.500
Yeah.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.100
Did he make night in the woods?

38:09.300 --> 38:09.500
Huh?

38:12.700 --> 38:12.900
Yeah.

38:12.900 --> 38:15.000
Alec Holowalk, a Canadian game developer.

38:15.100 --> 38:15.500
Yeah.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.100
Killed himself.

38:16.800 --> 38:17.200
Yep.

38:18.600 --> 38:20.300
He killed himself October, 2019.

38:22.700 --> 38:24.400
And how did that happen?

38:24.700 --> 38:28.100
Like, why do people say that she contributed

38:28.100 --> 38:28.600
to that?

38:30.400 --> 38:33.100
Uh, basically Zoe made false rape

38:33.100 --> 38:36.200
allegations against him and destroyed his

38:36.200 --> 38:38.900
career and he was already like prone to

38:38.900 --> 38:39.900
depressive bouts.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.100
I haven't looked at that story, um, in a

38:42.100 --> 38:43.300
long time, I have to go back and actually

38:43.300 --> 38:43.800
look at that one.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.000
Cause it wasn't related to gamer gate.

38:45.000 --> 38:46.100
It was like its own thing.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.700
There was a lot of like weird, deep lore.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.500
You know, like if the precursor to Kiwi

38:52.500 --> 38:54.300
farms that existed back then, cause it was

38:54.300 --> 38:56.800
before Kiwi farms, I think, you know, like

38:56.800 --> 38:58.500
they were digging around like Zoe Quinn's

38:58.500 --> 39:00.100
family and they found her original name

39:00.100 --> 39:01.500
because that's not her original name.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.500
They discovered that like, you know, her,

39:03.500 --> 39:06.000
her father comes from like old European

39:06.000 --> 39:08.500
money and like her boyfriend was like

39:08.500 --> 39:10.300
this guy who was the son of like an arms

39:10.300 --> 39:11.900
dealer, there was a bunch of weird shit

39:11.900 --> 39:12.600
that people found.

39:12.900 --> 39:14.100
And it was all really interesting and kind

39:14.100 --> 39:15.600
of fun and exciting to be like, Oh my God,

39:15.600 --> 39:17.300
we're discovering the secrets of like, of

39:17.300 --> 39:20.100
these people who, of these hipsters, who,

39:20.100 --> 39:21.900
they're almost like, like the late, like

39:21.900 --> 39:23.500
discovering like, like secrets of like, of

39:23.500 --> 39:24.900
like the upper class, you know what I mean?

39:24.900 --> 39:26.000
Like these people who have a lot of money,

39:26.000 --> 39:27.100
they're traveling around, they're going to

39:27.100 --> 39:28.500
different countries or going to all these events.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.700
It was, there was like, there's a big, there's

39:30.700 --> 39:33.000
an excitement part to it where you're like

39:33.100 --> 39:34.900
uncovering these, these weird secrets.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.700
Like, why is it that this, this, this

39:36.700 --> 39:38.800
hyper-socialist guy, Oh, he, he, he comes

39:38.800 --> 39:41.000
from old money and his dad selling weapons

39:41.000 --> 39:42.100
to Israel, like, Holy shit.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.800
You know, stories like that kept coming

39:43.800 --> 39:46.100
up about everyone, but in, but that was all

39:46.100 --> 39:50.100
like fun side stuff that contributed to the

39:50.100 --> 39:51.400
character of these people.

39:51.700 --> 39:54.400
But the actual gamer gate conversation

39:54.400 --> 39:59.700
itself was the, the, um, the game journalists

40:00.100 --> 40:02.000
and the independent developers who collaborate,

40:02.900 --> 40:04.600
who, uh, who agree to set narratives.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.500
Where, where money's changing hands sometimes.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.100
And then on the flip side, it was the

40:09.100 --> 40:10.900
harassment that these people received.

40:11.300 --> 40:13.100
Some of it legitimate, some of it illegitimate.

40:14.300 --> 40:15.100
Some of it deserved.

40:15.100 --> 40:16.200
I mean, not, not legitimate, you know what,

40:16.200 --> 40:16.700
you know what I mean?

40:16.700 --> 40:18.600
Like, like, um, deserve because they had

40:18.600 --> 40:20.100
behaved poorly, some of it not deserved

40:20.100 --> 40:21.200
because they were just, the people

40:21.200 --> 40:21.900
were just going crazy.

40:23.300 --> 40:23.700
Yeah.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.500
Um, so let me go back to the time.

40:26.500 --> 40:27.900
I want to see, yeah.

40:27.900 --> 40:32.000
How did Brianna Wu like contribute to stuff?

40:32.000 --> 40:34.500
Cause I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

40:34.700 --> 40:38.100
when I looked at thisconomical OCA, it

40:38.100 --> 40:40.500
says he was accused of physical and emotional

40:40.500 --> 40:41.900
abuse by Zoe Quinn.

40:42.700 --> 40:46.600
Um, did you mention Brianna women relation to that,

40:48.100 --> 40:49.300
no, no, she's not related.

40:49.300 --> 40:52.900
To the alcohol oil crate store or Anita

40:52.900 --> 40:56.900
Sarkeesian and Briana Wu, both inserted

40:56.900 --> 40:58.400
themselves into gamer gate.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.700
The Zoe post, didn't mention them.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.480
There's only post mentioned so we

41:02.480 --> 41:08.480
Quinn and the five guys that basically it, um, Anita Sarkeesian was already

41:08.480 --> 41:11.120
like, she was already kind of hated for the feminist frequency series.

41:11.120 --> 41:14.000
That was going since 2010 or something or 2011.

41:15.080 --> 41:19.840
Um, and it's my personal opinion that Anita Sarkeesian and Brianna

41:19.840 --> 41:23.760
Wu both inserted themselves into gamer gate and said, Hey, we're women too.

41:23.920 --> 41:27.500
We're also facing harassment to guys because it was a way to bolster their

41:27.500 --> 41:30.800
career, it was the same thing that Milo did, they all found opportunities

41:30.800 --> 41:33.880
to make their, to the kind of, you know, bump up their profile, make a

41:33.880 --> 41:35.800
name for themselves, grow their brand.

41:36.160 --> 41:41.640
They saw, you know, a, this rather organic, um, uh, cultural event

41:41.640 --> 41:44.640
happening on the internet and everyone jumped in out to try it, to try

41:44.640 --> 41:45.880
and basically pump themselves up.

41:47.920 --> 41:50.440
And that's the only reason that Brianna Wu was involved in it.

41:50.440 --> 41:50.800
She did.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.960
She, she wasn't involved in any of the actual events.

41:56.600 --> 41:57.000
Okay.

41:57.960 --> 42:03.040
I'm trying to look for, um, the timeline that you're, you said

42:03.040 --> 42:05.040
there's a timeline on know your meme.

42:05.840 --> 42:06.520
Yeah, I'll post it.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.680
Yeah, here it is.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.680
What do you think is the most like unbiased one?

42:15.000 --> 42:17.360
Um, good luck.

42:17.640 --> 42:21.040
10 years on everyone's kind of like set in their ways regarding

42:21.040 --> 42:22.320
a narrative, you know, good luck.

42:22.360 --> 42:25.480
If you like, if you search gamer gate right now, here, here, I'm going to go.

42:25.800 --> 42:26.680
I'm just going to see if this is true.

42:26.680 --> 42:26.840
Okay.

42:26.840 --> 42:27.600
I'm going to go over to Twitter.

42:27.840 --> 42:28.600
I'm going to search gamer game.

42:29.000 --> 42:29.200
All right.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.760
What do you, what are the latest tweets that say the word gamer game, aside from

42:32.760 --> 42:34.240
yours and mine, because we just tweeted about it, right?

42:34.440 --> 42:34.680
Yeah.

42:35.680 --> 42:40.560
Um, I don't know people accusing people of being fascist or something.

42:40.840 --> 42:41.400
Yeah.

42:41.960 --> 42:42.360
Yeah.

42:42.680 --> 42:44.760
Like, man, what was it?

42:45.640 --> 42:50.880
Hassan recently said that because the developer of the atomic heart video

42:50.880 --> 42:57.840
game didn't have any like left-leaning woke people, social justice people on the

42:57.840 --> 43:00.560
development team, and it was all like, like a bunch of kind of nerdy guys.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.560
Hassan said this was, this was a gamer gate developer.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.520
And I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

43:05.520 --> 43:06.800
Is that what gamer gate is now?

43:07.520 --> 43:08.600
Yeah, it's not going to find that one.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.200
Dude Hassan Hassan's hilarious.

43:12.200 --> 43:15.440
He's like the, the gift that keeps on giving when it comes to terrible takes.

43:15.520 --> 43:18.240
Yeah, certainly is.

43:18.280 --> 43:18.640
Yeah.

43:18.800 --> 43:23.040
I can't believe like the amount of terrible takes that one person can have.

43:26.120 --> 43:26.960
Let's see here.

43:27.160 --> 43:28.280
What do you think about this?

43:28.320 --> 43:34.440
So when I was looking through the rational Wiki, um, it said that somewhere in it, it

43:34.440 --> 43:45.760
says that, um, the Zoe Quinn post was debunked by, was it, let's see.

43:45.760 --> 43:50.800
Um, debunked by Yoni himself.

43:51.920 --> 43:58.280
Um, let's see, I'm doing the control F for debunked and see what we get.

44:02.000 --> 44:02.920
Uh, let's see.

44:05.720 --> 44:10.120
According to IRC logs, the Zoe post was later edited by Aaron.

44:10.720 --> 44:13.640
The original accusations were later debunked by himself.

44:13.640 --> 44:15.080
Let's see what this debunking is.

44:16.760 --> 44:21.760
Zoe Quinn, Aaron clarifies the Zoe Quinn, Nathan Grayson timeline.

44:21.760 --> 44:22.640
Let's see what the debunking is.

44:22.640 --> 44:23.280
I'm going to read this.

44:46.760 --> 44:46.960
Okay.

44:46.960 --> 44:47.560
I know what this is.

44:47.560 --> 44:48.160
I know what this is.

44:48.800 --> 44:49.000
Okay.

44:50.000 --> 44:55.480
Um, I think it was, it was either mundane, Matt or internet aristocrat.

44:55.800 --> 44:59.800
It was one of the two and I think it might be mundane, Matt, um, that made the claim

45:00.680 --> 45:07.000
that Zoe Quinn got favorable coverage of her game depression quest because of the

45:07.000 --> 45:11.880
fact that she was sleeping with Nathan, Nathan Grayson and Nathan Grayson, Grayson

45:11.880 --> 45:16.920
Nathan Grayson Grayson never, um, never reviewed the game depression quest.

45:17.240 --> 45:18.240
So that's true.

45:18.880 --> 45:23.800
Um, that was something that was floating around that I remember seeing repeated a

45:23.800 --> 45:25.960
lot during gamer gate, but it wasn't true.

45:26.120 --> 45:27.400
That part was actually false.

45:27.960 --> 45:35.000
Um, what was true was not the, the, uh, the, the review of depression

45:35.000 --> 45:35.880
quest that never existed.

45:36.280 --> 45:38.680
What was actually true was the coverage of the game jam.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.400
The game jam coverage was the actual thing.

45:41.880 --> 45:46.680
That, that Nathan Grayson reported on after he had slept with Zoe Quinn and Zoe

45:46.680 --> 45:48.200
Quinn was one of the principles in the story.

45:48.480 --> 45:53.640
And he had every reason to, to basically make the story look good for Zoe because

45:53.880 --> 45:56.000
Zoe faced potential legal action.

45:56.000 --> 46:00.440
If it, if it looked like she had intentionally tanked the game jam because

46:00.440 --> 46:02.800
she had her own game jam coming up soon, which she did.

46:04.280 --> 46:04.600
Yeah.

46:05.040 --> 46:05.520
Okay.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.000
Do you know what a game jam is?

46:07.760 --> 46:09.240
I don't know what a game jam is now.

46:09.680 --> 46:09.880
Okay.

46:09.960 --> 46:13.480
A game jam is a tournament where you get together a bunch of people and you

46:13.480 --> 46:16.720
sit them down in a room for like 24 hours or 48 hours or whatever.

46:16.880 --> 46:17.720
And you say, make a game.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.080
Make, make, make, just make, make a game really quick.

46:20.240 --> 46:20.560
All right.

46:20.760 --> 46:22.480
And it's like televised and it's like,

46:23.480 --> 46:24.680
yeah, I do know what this is.

46:24.680 --> 46:25.000
Okay.

46:25.040 --> 46:25.400
Yeah.

46:25.720 --> 46:30.320
So Zoe Quinn was invited to one and she had her own competing one lined up.

46:31.280 --> 46:31.600
Yeah.

46:32.000 --> 46:36.560
And there's reports that she intentionally tanked the one she was

46:36.560 --> 46:38.720
inviting on to get more eyes on hers.

46:39.400 --> 46:42.720
And the only person who reported on the event was the guy she was fucking.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.040
That's where the collusion is.

46:44.040 --> 46:47.160
It has nothing to do with, with, with, with reviewing Zoe's games.

46:48.400 --> 46:52.640
So how did, um, how, how did she intentionally tank the

46:52.640 --> 46:54.760
game jam, the competing one?

46:55.280 --> 46:56.120
I'd have to go back and see.

46:56.440 --> 46:57.360
That's, that's some deep lore.

46:57.360 --> 47:00.240
I don't, I don't remember exactly what it was, but I remember, I remember

47:00.240 --> 47:04.800
that she somehow intentionally tanked it and I had a chance to, hold on.

47:06.480 --> 47:06.920
Oh, fuck it.

47:07.280 --> 47:08.480
I had a, fuck it.

47:08.600 --> 47:12.400
I had a chance to, um, ask John Tron at one point who was part of the game jam.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.360
Like, did she actually intentionally tank it?

47:14.360 --> 47:14.960
And he was like, yeah.

47:16.120 --> 47:18.040
And he, he confirmed it to me personally.

47:18.880 --> 47:22.560
So I tend to believe it, but in terms of how she tanked the game jam,

47:22.560 --> 47:23.600
I have to go look that up.

47:23.840 --> 47:26.880
It was the centerpiece of one of internet aristocrats old videos,

47:27.160 --> 47:28.400
but I can't remember the details.

47:28.760 --> 47:29.040
Okay.

47:33.080 --> 47:33.520
Me too.

47:33.600 --> 47:38.080
There's just so much, there's so much deep lore in this that like, I

47:38.320 --> 47:45.520
I feel like, you know, I'm doing this interview with Brianna, um, uh, in a few

47:45.520 --> 47:52.720
days, show her the proof stardust, burn the bridge, um, we'll see.

47:52.760 --> 47:56.880
Um, I'm going to try and approach it as unbiased as possible.

47:56.920 --> 47:57.280
Right.

47:57.360 --> 48:01.200
Um, but, um, obviously there are things here that I can ask her about.

48:01.240 --> 48:01.720
Definitely.

48:01.720 --> 48:02.800
I'm going to ask her about them.

48:03.280 --> 48:12.280
Um, so, uh, yeah, uh, there's just so much stuff that, that is going on

48:12.280 --> 48:17.520
in this, in this timeline that like, I feel like I could study this for

48:17.520 --> 48:20.920
like a year and still not understand the entirety of the thing.

48:21.440 --> 48:22.760
Um, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

48:23.160 --> 48:25.160
Um, Jim's old videos were pretty good.

48:25.440 --> 48:27.080
Sargon's old videos are pretty good.

48:27.720 --> 48:30.840
Um, my old videos are pretty good, but the quality on them fucking sucks.

48:30.840 --> 48:33.240
Um, okay, here we go.

48:33.240 --> 48:35.080
I think, I think, I think I found it.

48:37.560 --> 48:38.040
Oh God.

48:38.040 --> 48:38.480
Yeah, that's right.

48:38.480 --> 48:39.720
Phil fish's Twitter rant.

48:40.200 --> 48:41.160
I'm so glad he's gone.

48:44.280 --> 48:45.240
Let me just give me a second here.

48:51.760 --> 48:52.240
Let's see.

48:53.320 --> 48:53.480
Okay.

49:00.840 --> 49:05.960
Oh, that's right.

49:05.960 --> 49:07.880
The fine young capitalists.

49:10.720 --> 49:13.800
Do you remember, did you hear what them, that was part of the story.

49:14.320 --> 49:16.040
I know that it's in the timeline.

49:16.040 --> 49:19.240
The fine, fine young capitalists are in the timeline.

49:19.680 --> 49:24.160
Here's here's they were, they were the ones that I think that

49:24.160 --> 49:25.600
they, they tanked the game jam of.

49:27.200 --> 49:30.080
This was, this was their story that they posted on, on Reddit.

49:30.840 --> 49:34.560
I'm going to pull that one up now.

49:39.440 --> 49:40.640
Oh, I see it here.

49:40.640 --> 49:42.080
And, okay.

49:43.120 --> 49:43.360
Right.

49:43.440 --> 49:43.960
Um,

49:49.160 --> 49:51.320
Oh yeah, someone in your chat just said that the fine young

49:51.320 --> 49:52.560
capitalists are completely gone.

49:52.560 --> 49:52.800
Oh yeah.

49:52.800 --> 49:54.360
They've been gone for like five or six years now.

49:54.640 --> 49:57.840
They just, they just left because fuck.

49:58.520 --> 49:59.000
Yeah.

49:59.080 --> 50:01.720
So, uh, if you don't mind, I'm going to read this to the chat.

50:01.720 --> 50:05.880
It says she fucking docs me ruined a production for women refuse to

50:05.880 --> 50:09.520
contact us and is currently taking money for a game jam with no start

50:09.520 --> 50:11.720
date, no location and no judges.

50:11.920 --> 50:12.240
Okay.

50:12.240 --> 50:13.200
Here's my story.

50:13.520 --> 50:17.520
We ran a group that literally said any woman come up with an idea for a

50:17.520 --> 50:19.480
video game will give you concept art.

50:19.680 --> 50:22.960
So you can pitch your game and we'll put all the pitches online.

50:23.880 --> 50:25.040
The internet will vote.

50:25.320 --> 50:28.840
Uh, the internet will vote on the best one and we'll make that game.

50:28.920 --> 50:30.480
And give the profits to charity.

50:30.720 --> 50:34.240
If you get a lot of interest online and wants to make the game on your own,

50:34.440 --> 50:36.360
you can leave the contest at any time.

50:36.680 --> 50:39.640
Literally everyone that was in the top five didn't have programming

50:39.640 --> 50:42.280
experience, so they couldn't make their game on their own.

50:42.760 --> 50:46.800
She was like, why do you expect women to work for free and make games?

50:46.800 --> 50:51.120
We said, well, they get 8% of the money as royalties and they just have

50:51.120 --> 50:54.720
to give an idea other people will make the game and the profits go to charity.

50:56.200 --> 50:56.840
Doesn't matter.

50:56.840 --> 50:57.600
It's oppressive.

50:57.640 --> 51:01.280
She started a fucking Twitter storm, crashed our website, got my personal

51:01.280 --> 51:03.840
information docs, got us banned from Twitter.

51:04.080 --> 51:05.760
We email reporter.

51:05.880 --> 51:07.120
What what's up?

51:07.240 --> 51:08.960
And they're like, duh.

51:09.000 --> 51:13.720
If duh, if Zoe says it's oppressive, it must be true.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.360
Maybe you should give her money for rebel jam, which has no start

51:17.360 --> 51:20.880
date location or any other information, but totally isn't a scam.

51:21.200 --> 51:26.000
This happens at three, eight, uh, three major, uh, online publications.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.640
We literally said we'd pay her to consult on future projects and we

51:29.640 --> 51:33.920
closed down the contest if she would explain to us what is exactly offensive.

51:33.960 --> 51:35.520
No response, no response at all.

51:36.560 --> 51:39.600
Unless a reporter contacted her and then she's the victim.

51:39.960 --> 51:42.040
All this information is fucking online.

51:42.040 --> 51:43.120
The pitches are online.

51:43.120 --> 51:47.040
We did everything we said, but no online journalists will publish the story.

51:48.080 --> 51:48.760
Please vote.

51:49.000 --> 51:55.560
Even if we don't raise enough money, if, um, if show there's enough of a

51:55.600 --> 51:58.800
interest, we can get the winner, a grant to make their game.

51:58.840 --> 52:01.160
I am literally making no money on this contest.

52:01.160 --> 52:05.440
I just wanted to focus on something other than women being oppressed.

52:05.680 --> 52:09.560
I wanted to show that they made good games and everyone said, that's not

52:09.560 --> 52:11.840
what women in games wants to talk about.

52:13.920 --> 52:23.840
Um, so I guess that's their, their perspective, um, regarding the game jam.

52:24.240 --> 52:30.320
Um, and, uh, one thing, let me see here.

52:30.840 --> 52:43.480
Um, I remember seeing fine young capitalists and now the rational Wiki,

52:43.480 --> 52:53.160
and I know you said this is like super slanted, um, it says here, uh, Matthew

52:53.160 --> 52:56.960
rapper claims on Reddit that Zoe Quinn sabotaged their game jam and doxed

52:56.960 --> 52:58.280
him without providing any proof.

52:58.680 --> 53:02.040
The claims he made under his username by silly Slater, we deleted and or

53:02.080 --> 53:06.960
edited later on, um, his accusation seems to be based on a conversation

53:06.960 --> 53:11.320
with Zoe Quinn from March cop compiled by Metroid composite that was

53:11.320 --> 53:13.040
apparently settled in private.

53:13.640 --> 53:14.160
Um,

53:19.120 --> 53:19.480
yeah.

53:19.480 --> 53:23.560
And then on August 29th to find young capitalist backpedal on their claims.

53:27.600 --> 53:28.040
Let's see.

53:33.160 --> 53:34.960
I'm just trying to be as thorough as possible.

53:35.000 --> 53:35.160
Nope.

53:35.160 --> 53:35.640
It makes sense.

53:35.680 --> 53:38.600
I'm also, this is all also like old lore for me too.

53:38.600 --> 53:41.000
Is I don't have to like, look at it to jog my memory.

53:41.440 --> 53:45.880
I'm pretty sure when it's kind of strange, this is from an era before the trend

53:45.880 --> 53:48.480
stuff was like really center stage in the left.

53:48.480 --> 53:56.880
So, um, a lot of the, a lot of the feminism of this era was kind of anti-trans, you

53:56.880 --> 54:00.720
know, they, they still held the opinion that like trans women were male

54:00.720 --> 54:03.920
infiltrators that wanted to destroy feminism and stuff like that.

54:04.400 --> 54:06.760
The trans stuff didn't really come about till like 2017.

54:07.120 --> 54:13.960
So, uh, I think, I think they dead name that the main person involved in find

54:13.960 --> 54:16.200
young capitalists on this, this website.

54:16.200 --> 54:21.400
Because yeah, it says Matthew Rapard and I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure that's a

54:21.400 --> 54:21.800
girl.

54:22.280 --> 54:25.320
Well, no, no, I mean, I don't get, I don't give a shit, but like, it's, it's just been

54:25.320 --> 54:28.360
up, it's been up for so long and this is obviously like an old timeline.

54:28.840 --> 54:33.400
So like people haven't edited this in years and back then dead naming was not a

54:33.400 --> 54:33.960
big deal, right?

54:34.520 --> 54:35.080
No one cared.

54:36.440 --> 54:38.600
It's just, it's just strange to see how like things have changed.

54:39.160 --> 54:44.120
Um, okay, let's see the poll board gets behind funding the fine young capitalist

54:44.120 --> 54:44.680
crowd funding.

54:44.920 --> 54:47.080
The fine young capitalist crowd funding campaign.

54:47.080 --> 54:48.600
They call it operation chemo.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.760
The crowd funding campaign, the fine young capitalist gets closed.

54:55.400 --> 54:58.040
They blame it on Zoe Quinn without providing any proof.

55:06.040 --> 55:06.440
Okay.

55:07.720 --> 55:14.040
Well, it looks, it looks like on that image, if that's a true email, the Indiegogo team

55:14.920 --> 55:16.440
is saying they're doing this for Zoe.

55:17.320 --> 55:21.160
So this is back when Indiegogo was like at small companies, they could like send out

55:21.160 --> 55:22.360
impersonal emails like this.

55:23.400 --> 55:23.800
Let's see.

55:23.800 --> 55:25.000
I'm trying to find what you're talking about.

55:25.640 --> 55:25.880
Yeah.

55:27.720 --> 55:27.960
Right.

55:27.960 --> 55:28.200
Okay.

55:29.400 --> 55:29.640
Yeah.

55:29.640 --> 55:31.480
Back from their claim that Zoe Quinn docs are hacking them.

55:31.480 --> 55:31.800
So that's.

55:33.000 --> 55:34.360
And I'm trying to read this, but.

55:35.560 --> 55:38.120
Lots of the links are broken and stuff on these old things, eh?

55:38.120 --> 55:38.680
Yeah.

55:38.680 --> 55:39.320
Yeah, they are.

55:40.520 --> 55:41.880
Oh, fucking Lego butts.

55:41.880 --> 55:42.680
Oh my God.

55:42.680 --> 55:48.760
Oh, I'm just like getting brainwaves, man.

55:50.040 --> 55:50.600
Oh, here it is.

55:50.600 --> 55:52.280
Zoe Quinn didn't understand this project.

55:52.280 --> 55:55.080
She decided to send some followers our way.

55:55.080 --> 55:56.200
One of them docs me.

55:56.200 --> 55:57.720
One of them sent a death threat.

55:57.720 --> 56:03.000
Tons of them called me transphobic and the majority of said the project was exploitative.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.560
It costed me money, a friend and a sponsor.

56:05.560 --> 56:06.280
She fucked up.

56:07.880 --> 56:09.400
I've been treated worse.

56:09.400 --> 56:10.760
I rarely think about it anymore.

56:10.760 --> 56:14.200
My greatest sin seems to be not pretending it didn't happen.

56:15.320 --> 56:15.720
It happened.

56:15.720 --> 56:17.080
She didn't know what she was doing.

56:18.840 --> 56:19.960
Where is that?

56:19.960 --> 56:20.440
Exactly.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.200
I'm trying to find these pictures.

56:22.920 --> 56:24.600
Yeah, it's not a picture.

56:25.160 --> 56:27.160
The backpedal on their claims link works.

56:29.080 --> 56:30.360
And so it's from that.

56:30.360 --> 56:30.760
It happened.

56:30.760 --> 56:31.800
She didn't know what she was doing.

56:31.800 --> 56:33.960
Apparently she's not an omniscient God.

56:33.960 --> 56:36.760
Except from heaven to purge the earth from human gamers.

56:36.760 --> 56:39.480
She's just some woman that wants people to make games.

56:40.040 --> 56:43.720
We wrote the statement slash piece for you with her specifically so that she could go

56:43.720 --> 56:46.760
to PAX and point to it if anyone asked how we felt about her.

56:47.720 --> 56:53.800
So they're saying that she directed followers our way and one of them docs me, but she herself

56:53.800 --> 56:54.840
didn't docs me.

56:54.840 --> 56:56.120
I still can't find that.

56:56.840 --> 57:01.320
So on August 29th, it says the final capitalist backpedal on their claims at Zoe Quinn docs

57:01.320 --> 57:02.120
to hack them.

57:02.120 --> 57:06.520
When I go to that site, it takes me to a tumbler.

57:07.320 --> 57:08.360
Oh, right, right, right.

57:08.360 --> 57:09.240
No, no, no.

57:09.240 --> 57:10.120
I was looking at a different page.

57:10.120 --> 57:10.600
Sorry.

57:10.600 --> 57:11.100
Yeah.

57:12.360 --> 57:13.000
Right.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.880
Find young capitalists are apologizing for getting punched in the face.

57:17.880 --> 57:18.440
Right.

57:18.440 --> 57:18.940
Okay.

57:26.360 --> 57:27.320
I remember this now.

57:27.320 --> 57:28.040
I remember this now.

57:28.040 --> 57:28.540
Yeah.

57:30.840 --> 57:32.040
I remember this now.

57:32.040 --> 57:37.880
So yeah, Zoe Quinn showed up and apologized to them and they kind of patched things up

57:37.880 --> 57:46.680
because this is like, this is this is during while it was blowing up, but it hadn't gotten

57:46.680 --> 57:47.960
to its peak yet.

57:47.960 --> 57:50.680
And I think the fine young capitalist, like they weren't in this for a culture war.

57:50.680 --> 57:52.120
They just wanted to do their project, right?

57:52.120 --> 57:52.920
They didn't.

57:52.920 --> 57:55.720
So Zoe Quinn was going to come to them and apologize to them and say, listen, it's not

57:55.720 --> 57:56.040
my fault.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.160
They were going to accept the apology.

57:59.240 --> 58:03.400
I remember I remember Zoe Quinn doing this a lot.

58:03.400 --> 58:07.640
She was like running around in people's DMS trying to put out like every single fire that

58:07.640 --> 58:10.200
she could lots of like, oh, it wasn't really me.

58:10.200 --> 58:11.080
Oh, it was somebody else.

58:11.080 --> 58:11.960
Oh, I'm sorry.

58:11.960 --> 58:13.080
I didn't direct this harassment.

58:13.080 --> 58:13.480
I didn't.

58:13.480 --> 58:14.280
I didn't.

58:14.280 --> 58:19.320
And it's like, okay, you know, sometimes sometimes your fans just kind of do what they're going

58:19.320 --> 58:20.360
to do without your input.

58:20.360 --> 58:21.720
You know, I've experienced that.

58:21.720 --> 58:24.200
I'm sure like like like Sargon's experience.

58:24.200 --> 58:27.320
I'm sure Destiny's experienced that, you know, like sometimes it just happens, right?

58:27.320 --> 58:29.720
So that's definitely a reasonable excuse.

58:32.360 --> 58:37.560
But like considering her behavior before and after gamer gate where like this kind of this

58:38.040 --> 58:44.600
pattern of behavior from her, um, I don't think that like she docs anyone, but I also

58:44.600 --> 58:49.160
don't think that she actually cared if one of her followers doc someone, I don't believe

58:49.160 --> 58:54.440
it personally, just because like, as a gamer gate went on, we looked into like the drama

58:54.440 --> 58:56.600
from that she got into before gamer gate.

58:56.600 --> 59:00.440
There's a drama that she's been in since gamer gate and there's been like a consistent pattern

59:00.440 --> 59:07.000
of behavior with this woman where it's been like, I'm not going to do anything about anything,

59:07.080 --> 59:12.600
but you know, it, it, you know how like, you know how sometimes people will just like post

59:12.600 --> 59:17.800
someone's name and address without an actual like threat of violence attached, but you

59:17.800 --> 59:20.120
know, they're kind of like hoping someone's going to do something ridiculous.

59:20.680 --> 59:24.600
This is like an on what Zoe Quinn is like an online variant of that where she'll like,

59:25.320 --> 59:30.280
she'll go right up to the edge of actually saying something wrong, and then do that consistently.

59:30.920 --> 59:38.280
So, um, so what drama was she involved in before gamer gate?

59:38.280 --> 59:38.760
Do you know?

59:40.920 --> 59:46.680
Oh, God, it's there was something about her, she moved to Toronto to avoid

59:48.440 --> 59:52.120
some sort of like a divorce settlement or something because she was married.

59:52.680 --> 59:55.080
And she actually like fled to Canada for a year or two.

59:55.080 --> 59:59.880
I don't remember that the full details and then like basically once the legal

59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.440
troubles kind of died down, she moved back to the States.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:09.560
She just has like a history of these really toxic personal relationships where she's using people.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.080
Aaron's only like one of many.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:14.620
Yeah.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:15.660
Yeah.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.800
This me I can look this up.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:18.520
Let's see.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.020
Zoe.

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:23.660
Jesus.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.000
Is this it?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:27.720
Yeah, here we go.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:34.520
So, Brianna, you said Brianna Woon and Anita Sarkeesian kind of inserted themselves into

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.640
the gamer gate stuff.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.080
I'm assuming by like, posting something in response to it.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:48.840
Um, yeah, basically, they like they saw like the, the culture war kick up, and they started

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.440
like commenting on it and saying I've been harassed to I've been harassed to give me give

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.800
me some attention guys.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.960
Like there's there's a lot of that happening from those two.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.720
Okay, yeah.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.560
Here's right.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.200
It was um, I think.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.040
I see it here.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:11.240
Brianna Woon lead developer at giant space cat studios decides to make a joke Twitter

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.600
account to mock gamer gators without mentioning them at all.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.480
90 minutes past she reports being targeted by harassment.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.440
I think I found the Toronto stuff with Zoe.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.080
It's like another sexual assault allegation that ended up not panning out.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.560
There's a bunch of those in her past.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.080
So I think that's what this is.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:34.600
This is like a research stream now.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.800
I just ancient lore.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.000
Sorry.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.920
No, no, I enjoy this sort of thing.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.420
Yeah.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:41.420
Okay.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.440
I think it's safe.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:44.920
No, thanks.

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.760
I think I'm safe.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:47.640
No, thanks to you.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:48.680
Do not tweet at me again.

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.680
We will no longer be doing interviews with blank.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:58.040
We have creator of they bleed pixels expressing his disgust for an individual who assaulted

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.960
Zoe Quinn at a gaming event.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.360
The individual is respected amongst the gaming scene.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:06.840
The individual explains himself, but they bleed pixels doesn't believe him.

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:22.200
Yeah, it looks like the black text is like what's explaining what's happening here since

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.640
a lot of it's been lost to time.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.420
Yeah.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.420
See here.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:35.080
So then this Miguel says drunk isn't an excuse for behavior.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.200
I was still in cold sober.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:38.040
I saw how you acted and what you did.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.240
Now please leave me alone.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:44.840
Blank asking help usually requires you to say things rather than silently brooding.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.720
Also doesn't require you to grab and injure Zoe.

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:50.920
And then this explanation text says Jesus does fucked up.

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.920
What would compel someone to act that way?

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.960
Rooting silently and then continuing to grab at Zoe's arm.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:56.460
Weird.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.160
Which I assume is like sarcastic.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.120
Miguel says, oh, awesome.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.200
Now he's giving my number out to his friends so that they can try and harass me too.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:08.920
Thanks, asshole.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.160
Weird how these people who harass Zoe always do it by phone.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:15.480
So there's not really any proof of it ever happening.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.920
It's almost like a wizard did it.

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.000
It's okay means blank is sorry.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.400
He got drunk and assaulted Zoe.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.880
We can forgive him because he's a dude centric.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.040
He's in a dude centered biz, right?

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.160
What does this even mean?

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:35.480
This is how much he's prepared to defend Zoe and extrapolate the night's events for the cause.

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:49.400
I think it's going to be a common issue as all local indie communities grow.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.160
We need to set a precedent, not cool.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.920
The bleed pixels guy probably didn't realize how much Zoe was lying.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.560
His behavior is really what we'd want good people to do.

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.840
They see what they believe to be a person being harassed and they step in and help.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:09.240
Unfortunately, Zoe was using the nice events to spin this particular individual as a creep buck.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.680
Really, he was a person Zoe was until recently involved with counting on a friend for help.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.080
We also see here some of the rewards of white knighting.

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:22.200
It's got to feel great to have people congratulate you just for being a good person, right?

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.160
Okay.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:42.280
Months later, the Toronto indie scene for the most part found out what Zoe's true nature really was.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.640
She wasn't welcome there anymore.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:48.520
She'd end up moving to San Francisco and living with Patricia Hernandez who promised to make her big.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.760
Zoe now views Patricia as a hack who never made good on her promise.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.400
Zoe and this individual had a brief fling.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.000
He wanted more and Zoe didn't.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.400
They decided to break it off but were still friends.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.200
They both attended the event and when this individual got the news,

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:11.960
he thought Zoe would still be a friend he could trust to talk to and have some support.

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:17.400
He kept grabbing her arm trying to beg her to just listen because he was probably disintegrating internally.

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.120
Kind of a dick move to not just leave her alone

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.880
but he had been drinking and probably received some of the worst news of his life.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.720
Instead, Zoe used it as an opportunity to make him look like a creep.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:32.920
He got too close and actually wanted something meaningful so she used this as a clean out.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:37.960
She said he was stalking and harassing her and essentially tried to ruin his reputation.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.920
He kept his distance from her since that night.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.840
Zoe would use this event as a so brave story about herself

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.960
saying her boss came on to her and dislocated her shoulder.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.520
She was never employed by him, her shoulder was never dislocated,

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:55.880
and days later her friends saw her doing manual work with no discomfort.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:03.240
Okay, so this is what happened prior to gamergate.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:03.740
Yeah.

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.100
Yeah.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:08.040
And there is at least a couple other stories,

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:10.680
but I mean they're going to require digging up in in the same thing.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.360
Yeah, wow.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:16.120
Um, another thing that happened was not your shield.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:16.920
Did you hear about that?

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.480
I did not hear about that.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.200
I'm so sorry.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.600
I'm making you explain everything.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:23.100
That's fine.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:31.720
There was a claim for a while that the only people involved in gamergate were straight white men,

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.240
and that that's all it was.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:38.200
And in response, a shit ton of people post pictures of themselves saying that no,

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.880
they were women and they were also pro gamergate.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:45.240
They just weren't part of the, you know, the game journo indie clique.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:51.480
They weren't in the club, you know, this image went viral on September 2nd.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.560
Um, I still remember like half of these girls,

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.600
because it's 10 years later, they've all kind of like gone their separate ways.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.600
I think shoe on head even posted one of these, one of these not your shield images.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:10.120
Um, some of them have gone like far, right.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.560
Some of them have gone far left.

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.440
Um, a few of them have left the internet entirely.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.560
Some of them just don't make content anymore.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:26.440
But basically a lot of these people, um, a lot of these people who were pro gamergate,

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.680
weren't just straight white men.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:34.120
And there's a comic that you see sometimes where it's like a black woman who's going

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:39.240
to like explain something and then a white woman like puts her hand over the black woman's mouth

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.280
and says, you're oppressed.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:43.160
Let me explain that came out of not your shield.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.520
That was first drawn for not your shield.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:45.800
Okay.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.840
Okay, interesting.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:57.640
Um, there's also Milo falsely accusing Zoe Quinn of embezzling money from their game.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.920
And then accusing of lying about her police report.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.680
Milo falsely abuses.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.280
I'm always going to embezzling money.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:08.920
What was this?

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:20.680
If you've donated money to I've Fred, why does that charity say you haven't?

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.840
How much money has depression quest raised?

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:30.200
What percentage of that money have you donated to, um, to date to I've Fred?

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:35.720
Oh, I see what's going on.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.520
Okay.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:36.840
Okay.

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:42.360
So Zoe Quinn said that, um, the proceeds from her game depression quest, at least a portion

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:45.160
of them will be donated to I've Fred, which is a depression charity.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:48.040
And Milo called her up, asked for a comment.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.000
Zoe hung up on him.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:09:00.120
Um, I've Fred confirmed that Zoe, that no one had donated to, uh, to them from this

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:00.840
game.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:04.520
Um, the issue is depression quest is a free game.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:05.880
Yeah.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.800
There's no, there's no profits to be made.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.080
So I guess Zoe Quinn technically did donate a portion of all of her profits, which is

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.280
a portion of zero.

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.960
So it's not a false statement.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.160
It's just kind of a misleading one.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.200
Yeah.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:23.480
Um, however, even though you could interpret this as Milo being wrong, you can interpret

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:28.440
this as Zoe being sneaky, whatever, even though, even if you say that this story didn't happen,

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:31.880
Zoe did later embezzle money for a different game after gamer gate.

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:35.640
And that's not going to be improved in this timeline.

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:38.120
Cause she did it like three years later, but she did embezzle money for a game.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:39.000
Yeah.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:44.440
There was like, uh, do you know the room, the terrible movie, the room?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:45.240
Yeah.

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.040
Yeah.

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.600
Remember the guy that played Mark with like the ginger beard, that guy?

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.320
Yeah.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.960
She hired that guy to do an FMV game where he was the star.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:00.360
She raised a shit ton of money and then she just never put it out.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.840
And whenever you ask her, she's like, yeah, I spent all the money.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:03.160
Sorry.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.280
She just admits it.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:04.440
Yeah.

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.400
There's no more money.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.120
Really?

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:06.440
Wow.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.480
Um, okay.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.000
So I'm going to find that.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:13.320
Hold on.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.840
This is a post gamer gate drama.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:19.000
So it's, let's see.

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:22.200
Let me find it.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:26.760
Come on.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.080
This was back in 2018.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.280
There's like layers.

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.720
So you have to like keep digging down.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:37.720
Yeah.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.400
So we quit an FMV game, no info since over six months.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.000
Come on.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.640
So we Quinn steals $85,000 from gullible Kickstarters.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:05.000
Give me something more concrete than just a, uh, a forum post talking about it.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:09.960
Will this give us something?

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.160
Yeah, here we go.

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.200
Here's an article.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.160
Uh, kick scams.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:24.440
Yep.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.280
They just, they cover Kickstarter scams.

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:27.560
She was obvious from the name, right?

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:28.760
Yeah.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.080
Project tingler kickstarted in the butt.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.760
So Quinn and Chuck tingle FMV game.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:36.520
Okay.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:44.120
Um, although she continues to solicit PayPal donations for the, for development

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:47.480
Quinn's Kickstarter account has not been accessed since April, 2018.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:56.280
Um, project tingler has yet to leave the pre-alpha stage of development.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:04.760
Um, yeah, it raised $15,000 beyond its original Kickstarter goal and promises

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.440
of early access and sneak peaks.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.240
Um, updates have become increasingly rare questions and concerns from backers

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.600
are routinely neglected for periods up to and exceeding six months.

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:21.000
Um, uh, let's see.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.280
Twitter messages to lead developers, Zoe Quinn and project manager,

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.120
John E. Warren remain unanswered.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.360
Despite both being active users of the platform.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:38.920
Um, author chunk Chuck tingle, who's fictional universe project tingler set

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.520
has responded with hostility to those exasperated by the lack of communication.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.920
Um, yep.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.360
Um, the LDR is still working on it just slower because I ran out of money

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:56.760
a long time ago and had to get day jobs.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.760
Also, I have been working on ways to bring on some assistance with finishing it.

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.280
Also don't yell at Chuck about it.

01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.720
Shipping the game is on me.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.800
Um, Hey, and then.

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.480
Oh, I see.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:15.320
This is a response to the, yeah, the, the, she, these are two tweets that she

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:21.000
sent as time went on regarding where the money went in the second one.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.040
She just says ran out of money.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:22.600
Sorry.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.320
Ran out of money a long time ago.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.680
Not cool with asking people to work for free, got a day job to start crawling

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:32.760
out of debt and in a place where I can properly finish it, this is the day job.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.240
I'm not sure.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:33.800
I'm not sure.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.360
I'm not sure.

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:38.200
And in a place where I can properly finish it, this is the day job.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:46.040
Uh, the issue ultimately is, is while she's posting stuff like this,

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:48.040
she's also posting stuff like this.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.680
And so people are saying, Hey, we're donating all this money to you.

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.720
And you're saying that you ran out of money to actually finish the game.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:03.640
Where are you getting the money to go on these trips and do it and do these things?

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:08.440
Time to stop being bitter about the people trying to stop my joy and bad

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:12.520
faith and go back to appreciating the fact that I get to be too busy with

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.120
making cool shit that I love to completely goof off in Tokyo.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:19.880
One awesome problem I get to have, just like the awesome problem of the

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:24.280
ryokan owner telling me she had to swap out the yukata in my room for the

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.520
big booby yukata instead, bless her.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:28.520
Okay.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:29.880
Yeah.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:30.200
Oops.

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:36.680
Um, yeah, so basically it's been years and years and years.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.520
A bunch of money has just vanished.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.960
There seems to be no accountability.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.320
So it's, it's pretty, it's pretty clear where it went.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:46.840
This is like the, where did, where did all Keflez's money go, guys?

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.440
It's kind of the same thing, you know?

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:49.560
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.680
Um, wow.

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:53.000
Okay.

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.720
This is, um, this is really good going through like, oh, clearly slanted,

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:01.880
um, timeline and like, and getting your take on these things since you

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.560
have like a different perspective.

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:06.440
Um, yeah, yeah.

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:09.480
Um, so it's very clearly slanted.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:15.320
And yes, so Milo also accused me of falsely of lying about a police report.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.360
I want to see what that link is.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.200
Falsely of lying about a police report.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.320
I want to see what that link is.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.520
Oh, that, I think that link's dead now.

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.560
Whatever it was, it's not leading to anything anymore.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:34.840
Um, my listeners and Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian get to debunk.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:43.160
Um, you can see if I can, uh, the debunking is that Sarkeesian,

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.720
her case is being actually handled by the FBI.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.520
So, um,

01:15:58.680 --> 01:15:59.240
okay, let's see.

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:03.240
Okay.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.120
Is this it?

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:04.360
Okay.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:04.440
Yeah.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.800
Cause that link is, is dead.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:10.280
It looks like, so this is from during the initial days of gamer gate where

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.440
Anita claimed that she was driven out of her house.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:18.680
Um, by trolls posting, you know, her address to her or something.

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:23.400
Um, it's,

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.880
uh, that's not the debunked part.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:37.000
The debunked part is like Milo tweeting that he talked with, um,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.440
that he talked with SFPD and they say that the Sarkeesian case is being dealt with by the FBI.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:42.680
Yeah.

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:47.960
That's this image here, which is Milo's old Milo and Mike Cernovich is old.

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:48.440
Oh yeah.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.400
I don't know if you knew this.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:51.400
Mike Cernovich got his start in gamer gate too.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.320
Oh really?

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:53.560
Yep.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:55.560
Man.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.040
Okay.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.960
I haven't, this is going to be a bit of a side story.

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:00.040
I haven't heard of Mike Cernovich since gamer gate.

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:01.000
I know he's been floating around.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.920
He's been like, he wrote the gorilla mindset.

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:07.240
He's been selling like the gorilla drugs to like get people to they're like

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.360
caffeine enhancers or something.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:12.040
I don't fucking know what they are, but like he's, he's kind of tried to hop on the,

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:15.320
um, the manosphere train, right?

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:16.520
Man.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:21.320
I did, I did a video on, um, on Andrew Tate, I think two days ago, just like a,

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:25.560
an update on some of the things because, um, you know who Nick Monroe is?

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:27.000
I don't.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:27.960
Who's that?

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.000
Do you know crab crawler?

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:30.680
Yeah.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.160
On Twitter?

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:32.280
Yeah, I know.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.240
That's a secret account.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.920
Don't tell anyone that's Nick Monroe.

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.760
Nick Monroe is an investigative journalist.

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:42.760
And he first got big live tweeting some trials four or five years back.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:43.800
And I've talked to him a bunch of times.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:44.360
He's a good guy.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.560
Uh, but his whole thing is like deep dives, gamer gate style, deep dives.

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:55.160
And he, I, I basically did a video, uh, crediting him and putting all of his

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.480
research into, into video format.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:02.280
But he did a big ass thread where he discovered that Mike Cernovich was in

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:09.560
Andrew Tate's war room, selling his, selling his gorilla drugs to Andrew

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:11.160
Tate and other people there.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.600
That's wild.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.040
I think I remember that actually.

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.400
That's wild.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:15.640
Yeah.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.840
And so when Andrew Tate says, yeah, I make my girls do 16 hour days in front

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:25.080
of the camera, a crab crawler was like, listen, are you giving them the gorilla

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.040
drugs to keep them going?

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.400
Like what's going on here?

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:27.720
What is.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:29.800
Wow.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.080
Yeah.

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.040
So you just outed a secret on stream.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:39.640
Oh, what that, uh, that Nick Monroe is crab crawler.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:40.440
Yeah.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.080
I think it's like Sammy public knowledge at this point.

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:46.280
Okay.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:47.160
Wow.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.360
He was like perma band from Twitter for a while for unearthing the wrong

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.920
secrets for live tweeting about the wrong trials, but, uh, he came back and

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:58.040
now that Elon's back, no one cares anymore, you know, now that Elon's in

01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:58.680
control of things.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:18:59.800
Yeah.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:08.520
No, I still see people getting like wrecked by Twitter, like TOS or whatever.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.840
Um, yeah, I was banned for a week.

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:12.520
Yeah.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:12.920
Yeah.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.840
What for, what did you get banned for?

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:22.440
Um, I said that being trans was a mental illness and because it's gender

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:26.840
dysphoria and transitioning is the proper medical treatment for the illness.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.680
And if you try to make being trans and aesthetic and not a mental illness,

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.320
you're going to completely remove the medical side of it.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:37.400
And now suddenly a bunch of trans people are going to be left without their

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:37.880
healthcare.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:43.080
So you can, you guys need to chill the fuck down, but you guys, you guys need

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:46.440
to calm down with this shit because you're, you're ruining things for trans

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:46.840
people.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:48.520
And that got me banned for a week.

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:49.800
Wow.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.800
I can't believe that got you banned.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:53.080
Yep.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:54.200
It's true too.

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:57.720
I know it's, I know it's kind of spicy, but it's true.

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:03.400
Like, I mean, you know that you have to argue then what is the justification

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:07.480
of like giving, um, like medical treatment to all these trans people with

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.920
just an aesthetic that you can claim.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:09.880
Yeah.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:10.440
Yeah.

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:13.320
There's a clip that I use over and over and maybe I can actually find it for

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:13.480
you.

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:13.880
Hold on.

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:25.880
If I can't find it for you, I'll upload it because fuck.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:26.360
It's funny.

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.040
Is this it?

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.240
No, it's not it.

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:29.560
Fuck.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.880
Come on internet.

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:35.560
Help me out.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:49.880
Oh, maybe I can't.

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:50.520
God damn it.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:51.320
Yeah.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.680
I wonder if it's small enough that I can just send it to you over for

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:55.160
discord.

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:04.840
A lot of people tuned in for your gamer gate summary.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:05.880
Really?

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:07.640
What's the numbers looking like?

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:11.320
There's like 155 on YouTube right now.

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:11.960
Oh, nice.

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:12.840
Hi guys.

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.240
What's up?

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.640
Yeah, I'll upload it like privately.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:24.600
I'll set it to, I use this clip so much in my videos because it's so ridiculous.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:25.640
It's one of those stock clips.

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.960
I just keep around whenever I have to bring it up.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:32.440
Okay.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.680
Uh, unlisted.

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.400
This should be good.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.520
Everybody's saying, um, hi dev to you.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.280
Hello.

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:44.440
What was it?

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:46.440
I'm here for dev.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.320
I'm a fan of him.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.280
Yeah, I'm a fan too.

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:49.400
He's pretty cool.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.120
Oh, well, thank you.

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.880
Nice to meet you.

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:52.840
Sundance.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.640
Excuse me.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.520
What did you call me?

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.320
Is your name Sundance?

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.520
It is not Sundance.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:21:59.720
Okay.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:00.280
Watch this.

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:03.240
Okay.

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.840
It would be the.

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:12.040
It's a minute, so I'll just kind of sit back and.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:13.400
Okay.

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.920
So, okay.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.840
So you're going to have to explain to me because I didn't get it.

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:19.320
I'm sorry.

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:20.520
Oh, no.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:22.120
No, I didn't.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.880
Well, let me, let me play it again.

01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:24.120
Okay.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.880
It might take me, it might take me a minute.

01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:33.720
I'm sorry.

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:41.080
It's just like a, for me, it's just like, okay.

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:45.480
Uh, you know, typical retarded take, but yeah.

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:45.720
Yes.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:45.960
Yes.

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.560
I mean, it is just a typical retarded take.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:47.800
Yeah.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:55.000
But if you want like a single sound clip that completely demolishes the entire, the entire

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.360
leftist view on what being trans is, it's this one.

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:04.520
If gender actually is just an aesthetic as she claims, then there's no reason for any

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:06.920
of it to be covered in terms of medical costs.

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:09.080
There's no reason for anyone to respect it.

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.600
You know, like, why would you?

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.600
Cause you shouldn't respect it any more than you would respect someone's choice of clothing,

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.120
which is sometimes inappropriate.

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.320
And sometimes it's not part of your identity anymore.

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:25.640
You know, like this, this one line of logic destroys everything that trans people have

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:29.160
been trying to build for pretty much ever.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:30.760
Yeah.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.440
So I keep this in my, I keep this in my back pocket and I'm like, listen, if I ever need

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.600
to like pull out, Oh, here's something retarded.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.280
I have it ready to go.

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:41.320
Yeah.

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:43.000
Yeah.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.840
It's, it's pretty retarded.

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:51.720
It's up there with, I think I remember seeing this actually and just being like, okay, really?

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:52.520
Yeah.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:53.400
Yeah.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:24:59.800
Wow.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:06.520
So I'm, I guess I'm going to have to like look through the more of this gamergate stuff,

01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.280
but like, what were you talking about before?

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:08.600
Yeah.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:09.400
Hold on.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:09.640
Yeah.

01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:13.000
Jesse single gets involved in this and writes a,

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:19.000
you know, writes a, writes a, an article about it.

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:30.360
Mike Cernovich goes after a nil dash in the name of gamergate for no apparent reason.

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:33.320
Dash has never written about gamergate or video games,

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.560
but has a history of Cernovich stalking him.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:36.680
What is that?

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:37.000
Sure.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:37.320
Let's see.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.080
Mike Cernovich goes after, huh?

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.040
Who's a nil dash?

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.080
I have no idea.

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:47.880
Yeah.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.640
This, I don't know what this part is at all.

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.760
So this is all news to me.

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:57.880
I mean, I'm not surprised that Mike Cernovich ended up being kind of a grifter.

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:00.920
Yeah.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.120
Let's see.

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:03.160
He goes after him.

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.640
Um, I don't know what this is, but.

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.120
Let's see what this is.

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:27.640
When the gamergate mob targeted a nil dash for no reason.

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:32.840
SJWs are bullies.

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:33.400
I hate bullies.

01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:34.680
How do you handle a mob of bullies?

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:36.440
You single them out one by one.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.840
Docs, Docs, Docs, Docs, Docs.

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:47.320
Oh, someone in your chat quickly asked, isn't the dear gender weirdo on some sort of mod

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.040
team for Twitch?

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.200
No, there's actually two dear gender weirdos.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:53.720
Fucking hell.

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.640
There's multiples of them.

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:55.880
Yes.

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:57.400
There's a herd.

01:26:58.520 --> 01:26:58.840
Yeah.

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:00.600
Well, there's two.

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.080
I don't know if two makes a herd, but maybe.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:04.040
Yeah.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:09.560
If believing the first amendment in due process makes me a sociopath, then I'm guilty as charged.

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:10.680
Aaron is a nice guy.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:12.200
I, on the other hand, am not so nice.

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:14.280
I play a lot meaner than SJWs.

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.320
Just wait till I issue subpoenas and start doxing.

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:18.200
Holy shit.

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:21.240
Mike Cernovich is like fucking unhinged in these tweets.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.040
Yeah.

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.200
Back in the old days.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.400
Now that this is a story that completely went by me, I have no clue that this happened.

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:54.120
I don't know.

01:27:54.120 --> 01:28:00.120
It looks like gamer gate ended up just being a massive W for the pro gamer gators.

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:08.760
I mean, kind of, kind of not, because if you look at the state of video game development

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:12.680
right now, it's certainly more woke than it was back then.

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.280
And they didn't want that.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:16.840
So I think a lot of them view it as like a massive loss.

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:22.120
You know, none of the people that they discovered to be, I guess with the exception of Phil

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:26.280
Fish, none of the people that were discovered to have been doing anything wrong ever got

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:27.080
punished for it.

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.120
They never lost their jobs.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.880
They never lost their positions.

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.160
They in fact got promotions.

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:36.680
You know, Nathan Grayson moved on from Kotaku to the Washington Post.

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:39.320
I think like Steven Toledo.

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.680
I think he moved on to somewhere else too.

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:42.280
Like basically their careers kept going.

01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:49.080
A few indie developers that like some of the worst people kind of had their careers collapse.

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:50.840
Like nobody pays attention to Zoe Quinn anymore.

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.640
No one cares.

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:54.680
Nobody pays attention to Nia Sarkeesian anymore.

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:56.040
You know, like her channel is dead.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:00.280
It gets like it gets like 100 views a video with like a million subs or something like

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:01.000
it's a dead channel.

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:08.200
Brianna Wu, I think is only relevant because she stopped doing game development and tried

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.480
to run for office.

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.800
So she completely jumped into a different sphere.

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:15.240
So I think she kind of survived by just getting out of gaming.

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:25.160
Yeah, like if you pull up what gets promoted on, let's say the latest Nintendo Direct or

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:31.640
the latest Sony State of Play, what's pushed to the front of the websites, what's pushed

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:34.360
to the front of these news outlets.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:39.960
You know, it's all stuff that gamer gators would have hated to see 10 years ago.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.040
So I don't think that they view it as a win.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:44.940
Really?

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.200
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:52.200
I feel like, isn't that just, couldn't that just be like the natural progression of things

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:58.920
as we get into more like globalized multicultural, you know, society, like things just naturally

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:02.360
get more like that.

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:09.160
Maybe it's not necessarily like a loss on gamer gate's side.

01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:12.520
Are you doing the whole Cthulhu swims left thing?

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.240
I don't know what that is.

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:15.800
Oh, hold on.

01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:19.320
It's an expression.

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:20.700
Right.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:22.600
It's from Moldbug.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:25.400
Cthulhu may swim slowly, but he only swims left.

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.440
You said Moldbug was based yesterday.

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:29.560
I remember that comment.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:35.560
Well, okay, there were, I only read a little bit of some of the stuff you were saying.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:40.120
Like, I'm not saying he, I said he had some base, some base takes.

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:41.640
I didn't say he himself was based.

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:42.140
Okay.

01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:45.400
So Stardust is going on the Neo reactionary arc, guys.

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:46.120
It's going to happen.

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:48.280
It's going to happen.

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.640
Um, the idea basically, you know what?

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:55.800
I think a better way to, okay, hold on.

01:30:55.800 --> 01:31:04.840
Robert conquest, three laws of politics, which law was it?

01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:07.740
Which one?

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.960
Um, what was the intended director could talk to?

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:14.280
Which one were you saying people would hate what they see?

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:15.480
Hold on a second.

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:17.880
Um, right.

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:22.440
Any organization, not explicitly right-wing sooner or later becomes left-wing.

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:27.000
That's the underlying idea behind Cthulhu swims left.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.360
So basically like culture is always progressing leftward over time.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.560
It's not progressing rightward.

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:36.360
I don't think that that's necessarily true because the Neo conservative win of Reagan

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:39.320
and Thatcher in the eighties kind of proved that decisively wrong.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:43.480
You know, there are the flagging economies in the west of the 70 that were kind of bogged

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:47.800
down by a lot of social spending, got revitalized by new conservatism.

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:52.280
So it's, I don't think this is a true statement that things always moved left-leaning, but

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:55.320
they've certainly moved left-leaning consistently in the past 30 years.

01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:57.480
And I think some people just don't like that.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:02.680
Well, yeah, I'm not trying to say that like things always have to move left-leaning, but

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:09.720
my more of what I would be saying is like, we live in a increasingly globalized society.

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:14.040
Like, you know, globalization is, you know, very widespread.

01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:20.840
Culture, you know, has been exported to a lot of different places and we're very multicultural

01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:23.480
society now as a whole.

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:27.080
So like us being a multicultural society.

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:32.200
Now, I don't know what, like, was it Kotaku you said that people would not like what's

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:35.080
being shown on the front page or whatever?

01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:39.480
I think so, yes.

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:43.080
Like that's what gamers would not like if they went to like the front page of, of even

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:45.560
maybe even steam, not, not, not steam is pretty impartial still.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:50.760
But if you go to the front page of Kotaku or polygon, I think the games that are featured

01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:55.480
or the political slants that are pushed people who were in gamer gate, if they could like

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:56.840
see the future, they probably wouldn't like it.

01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:58.440
Yeah.

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:04.440
I mean, I guess if it's, if it's like, I don't know, like, I guess I was just thinking more

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:07.640
about like representation in video games and stuff like that.

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:12.120
But if it's just like straight up, like left wing, like politics that are being pushed,

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:16.440
then yeah, I could see people not liking that and seeing it kind of like a failure.

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:22.840
The thing is like gaming was kind of unique because people never had a problem with representation

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:23.560
in it before.

01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:26.920
You know, if you go back to the 90s, you go back to the Super Nintendo, the Nintendo 64,

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:31.160
the PlayStation one, you could find black characters, no problem.

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:33.320
Female protagonists, you could find all this shit.

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:36.680
And, and they had like real things to do real stories.

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:40.360
It wasn't like a captain Marvel situation or a Ray Skywalker situation.

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:43.480
If we're going to go down like the quartering route here, where they have like these female

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:46.920
characters that have no arcs, they undergo no growth.

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:49.000
They don't suffer and like overcome and get better.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
They're just bad-ass from the start.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:51.720
And then they just win.

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.400
And it's not really an interesting story.

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:59.720
You know, you actually find female characters in video games who suffered and became heroic

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.000
like male characters did.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.080
That's been in gaming since before I was born.

01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:09.240
So I just think that like this whole, we need more diversity in games.

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:12.440
It always just ringed hollow to anyone who knew, you know?

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:17.480
No, I mean, I'm not saying that that sentiment itself was correct.

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:20.360
I'm just saying like, I don't know.

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:28.440
I saw, I see like people freaking out about their being more representation and it seems

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:35.640
kind of like, well, I'm not saying that we should push for it, but maybe they're being

01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:40.280
more than there was prior is kind of like a natural progression of things, you know?

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:48.520
But I think the ultimate issue is just that the games suck, but they hide behind.

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.040
They hide behind representation.

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.400
It's like, Oh, well, your game actually controls really poorly and it's not very fun to play.

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.320
Oh, but it has a black female protagonist.

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.920
If you complain, you're a bigot.

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.960
It's something like that.

01:34:58.600 --> 01:34:59.640
And you saw a lot of that too.

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:01.960
Yeah, for sure.

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:03.480
I can definitely see that.

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:10.280
Like with games and stuff, like with comics, like there've always been female protagonists

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:13.080
in comics and in superhero comics and all of that.

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:15.000
So, yeah.

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.720
And they've always been pretty complex.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.160
So it's not anything new, like you said, but.

01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:23.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:34.920
I was watching you watch Destiny and Richard Spencer talk last night, and there was something

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:39.000
that you just said that was kind of related to that, where it's like, there's the globalization

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.360
of culture and things are kind of becoming more mixed and these ideas are spreading around

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.160
more quickly.

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:50.280
I remember, like, I think both Destiny and Richard Spencer agreed that something's been

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.600
lost in the globalization, right?

01:35:53.400 --> 01:36:02.040
Yeah, the individual identity, people more easily found.

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:08.120
I think it's harder for people to kind of feel like they're individualistic nowadays

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:09.880
because everything is so widespread.

01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:10.280
I don't know.

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:11.240
Maybe that's just my.

01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:13.880
Yeah, that's definitely part of it.

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:18.600
There's also like, I think Destiny used the example of Nirvana, where they were just like

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:22.280
being shitty in a garage and they were discovered and they blew up.

01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:27.560
And it was this kind of like, almost like music that was anti music because it was so

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:34.440
it was so grungy, you know, but now everything is just kind of pre packaged and pre built

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:39.880
and pre made and nothing like the Internet was a breath of fresh air because things could

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:40.360
go viral.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:43.800
But even on the Internet now, like a lot of things that are going viral or like just kind

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:44.840
of push to go viral.

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:46.440
It's not organic anymore.

01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:47.800
It's all kind of like pre planned.

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:54.280
And in my, I forget how I worded it.

01:36:54.280 --> 01:37:00.040
I, you watched the video, it was the video about being indigenous.

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.400
What does it mean to be indigenous?

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:06.120
I made the point that there's a lot of people who are, let's say far left, you know, they're

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:10.520
socialists and they hate capitalist economics, right?

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:15.640
They say that it turns people into disposable workers and everyone's just replaceable.

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:19.160
And it doesn't actually respect the dignity of individuals.

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:25.000
And it's a, the complaint is that it makes everything and everyone disposable.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.640
And that's like one of capitalism's greatest sins.

01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:33.480
The problem with the socialists are somewhat correct when they say that, that that's true.

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:41.320
But the issue is the other half of the left, which is the progressives, they want to, you

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:46.440
know, mix cultures, have more open borders, more immigrants.

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:52.840
And what ends up happening is that with the cultural mix, you also get the economic fungibility.

01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:57.800
They kind of come hand in hand where like you, if you, I don't want to put this, it's

01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:03.080
something like, it's something like, fuck, how did I say it?

01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:04.840
I don't know.

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:07.800
I said it so well in the video and now that I'm live streaming, I can't say it anymore.

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:15.720
It it's, it's basically something along the lines of like the interchangeability that

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:22.840
socialists decry when it comes to capitalism comes hand in hand with this, with the cultural

01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:27.640
interchangeability that naturally happens as a result of globalization and progressivism.

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:32.040
And so in some senses, the left causes its own problem.

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:40.120
And I don't think that socialists will ever want to admit that, but I think it's true.

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:45.000
Can you repeat what you just said one more time?

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.600
The, what you, the line you were trying so hard to.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:51.000
Yeah, I'll try, I'll try it again.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.920
So I'm like, I already have lost it.

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:58.600
It's, it's something, it's something like the interchangeability in economics that

01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:05.720
socialists decry capitalism for having, they are partially caused by the interchangeability

01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:10.920
in culture that progressive is pushed for when they push for globalization and borders

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.920
and the merging of cultures and stuff.

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:13.320
Yeah.

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:13.560
Yeah.

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:18.840
So, so, so in some ways the left causes its own capitalist problem.

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.120
Yeah, I could see that 100%.

01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:27.800
That's because you're not a socialist, a socialist will never admit that for them.

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:32.040
It's always going to be like Marxist historical materialism and the contradictions of capitalism

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:34.440
and all this shit, but like they, Oh man.

01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:34.680
Okay.

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:38.040
There's a near reactionary writer named Nick land.

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:42.760
And he basically agreed with everything that the socialists said, not everything, not everything.

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:44.120
No, that's not, that's not accurate.

01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:48.360
He agreed with a lot of what the socialists said, but he said that the contradictions

01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:53.480
in capitalism were human beings and abolishing capitalism and abolishing people.

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:59.320
And that's when you get into like the technocratic future where you have AI's running everything

01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:02.920
and AI's producing all the goods and all the services.

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.760
And eventually they're just going to do away with humans.

01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:06.920
That's like the doomsday AI future.

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:07.480
You know what I mean?

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:08.280
Yeah.

01:40:09.560 --> 01:40:11.080
Oh, the chat says, Stardust seems bored.

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:11.800
Sorry.

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:12.920
No, I'm not bored.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:13.640
I'm not bored.

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:24.040
I guess I'm just trying to like, because this is a little bit above my head.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:32.280
But okay.

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:41.160
So I can definitely see that like the multiculturalism can, you know,

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:46.040
and the pushing of progressive values and open borders and all of that leads to a lot

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:53.640
of these, you know, downfalls of the economic system that like we operate under.

01:40:55.080 --> 01:41:02.840
And I can see that, where was I going with this?

01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:14.040
It's time to take the neo reactionary pill, Stardust.

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:21.880
Well, there is something like, okay, there's like a loss of individuality.

01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:24.120
And I think there's a loss.

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:26.600
There's a little bit of a loss of community too, right?

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:27.880
Like, well, not just a little bit.

01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:29.560
There's a huge loss of community.

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.480
There's not just a loss of individuality.

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:34.840
There's a loss of community, which is really strange to think about.

01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:40.600
Like both of these things happening simultaneously as a result of this,

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:43.160
you know, increasingly multicultural society.

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.080
But it makes sense.

01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:48.200
And I almost think that the fracturing of the internet is like,

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.320
this is funny, because this is something that like JF Gorepi was saying that he thinks

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.560
would happen, that there would be a fracturing of the internet.

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.280
And not just him.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:04.040
Other people have talked about it like that, you know, there are different countries with

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:07.960
their own internets now and, you know.

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:09.320
And I think I said this too.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:13.160
I did a video in like 2016 called the Balkanization of Technology.

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:19.480
It was right after like the, that James Guy put out, it was some kind of engineering

01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:24.120
document regarding how do you get more women into engineering spots in Google.

01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:27.400
He got fired for it because he spoke honestly about what the problem was.

01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:28.680
Oh, do you remember that at all?

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:30.360
I don't remember that, no.

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.560
Really?

01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.280
It was a big thing.

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:33.960
I did a video about it like 2016.

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:39.080
And my view was that the internet was going to Balkanize.

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:41.320
And we'd have like right-wing websites and left-wing websites.

01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:42.600
You have right-wing Twitter, left-wing Twitter.

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:42.920
Yeah, we see that.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.920
You have gaming Twitter, you know.

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.120
Yeah, we're seeing it, yeah.

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:53.320
Yeah, so with that being said, you know, I think JF was saying that he could see it happening.

01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:56.680
And this is what I was trying to explain to Destiny earlier with like the Fediverse and

01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:57.180
all of that.

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:05.320
You know, you see these instances like kind of blocking the entirety of other instances

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:09.800
off and they kind of become their own insular community.

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:17.160
And you see the same thing with like, I don't know, you see, like you said, these subsets

01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:17.800
of Twitter, right?

01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:19.800
These subsets of Twitter communities.

01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:21.880
Someone in the chat said James Damore.

01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:22.520
That's who it was.

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:23.160
James Damore.

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:33.720
Yeah, so I think it's interesting that we have this in the IRL space, I guess is what

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:34.280
I would call it.

01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:40.360
You have this increasing multiculturalism and it's good in a lot of ways, right?

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:46.680
And it's increasing a culture being exported to a lot of different places and being shared

01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:48.200
with a lot of different places, right?

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:54.360
And then at this, but at the same time, you have like a loss of people feeling like they've

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:56.760
lost their individuality and their sense of community.

01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:01.720
And I think that what's happening on the internet with the, like what you're saying, the balkanization

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:04.200
of the internet is kind of a response to that.

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:13.640
So people are kind of looking for a sense of identity online and through politics and

01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:20.120
through their political identity online.

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:22.600
And I think that we can kind of see that happening.

01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:31.400
Like you see how polarized people are in politics online, how people who should get along don't

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:40.440
get along, like how much socialists of different types will fight with each other and like

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:41.560
excommunicate each other.

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.000
Well, that's not new.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
You can see that a hundred years ago, too.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:45.880
Oh, really?

01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:47.000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.640
It just feels like things are, it does feel like politics is more polarized though, at

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:53.640
least in American society.

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:58.280
Maybe it's just in my brain, but it seems like that's the case.

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:07.800
And I think that might be a natural reaction to this loss of like what people think made

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:09.800
them individual, I guess.

01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:10.840
I think that's part of it, yeah.

01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:15.240
I mean, Richard Spencer said something that I think is probably correct in that video

01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:16.440
you were watching yesterday.

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.240
And it's that America was always an empire.

01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:21.000
It wasn't a nation state, right?

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:27.000
That's why you have states and not provinces because you have 50 states, 50 different types

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:28.440
of people who are all kind of different.

01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.200
And you're all united under one federal government.

01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:35.320
You're from India, so you definitely know this too.

01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:37.880
Like the Indian government is a federal one because you have all these different types

01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:39.080
of people under one government.

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.200
Canada is kind of the same.

01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.640
We have provinces in Canada, so it's not quite the same, but like there's definitely a difference

01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:49.480
between people on the East coast and the central Canada and the West coast, Ontario.

01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:52.120
You have the French people in Quebec, like different kinds of people here.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:58.520
Meanwhile, you look at Europe and in France, there's French people, right?

01:45:58.520 --> 01:45:59.320
It's a nation state.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.480
In Japan, there's Japanese people.

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:03.400
It's a state for a nation.

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:05.080
That's not how it is in the West.

01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:13.240
So I think that basically because there's so many different types of people and we no

01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:22.040
longer have an identity because having one is racist now because they're going to call

01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:25.720
you white supremacists if you have any kind of identity, even if it's not a white one,

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.160
you could be like, oh, I'm proud to be American.

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:28.040
Oh, well that's being racist.

01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:28.680
It's like, well, is it?

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:29.240
No, it's not.

01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:31.080
But some progressives say that it is.

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:37.240
I think like once you strip away any sort of possible ethnic identity, whether it's

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:41.640
like a civic nationalist identity or an ethnic nationalist identity, some sort of identity

01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:43.560
that revolves around your polity.

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:49.000
Once you strip that away, you're left with political groups, ideologies.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.680
You're left with sports teams.

01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:52.360
You're left with being a gamer or not.

01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:56.120
You're left with all sorts of other things that can be destructive, right?

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:01.480
And I think Richard Spencer was right when he just talked about, he was saying stuff

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:05.480
about how like there's, oh man, have you watched any crowd videos yet?

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:08.760
I love crowd.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.840
Have you seen his video?

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:13.800
It's an hour and a half long.

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:15.080
His video on realism.

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:17.560
No, I haven't seen it.

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:19.080
That is one of the best ones he has made.

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:19.720
You've got to watch it.

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:20.200
It's great.

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:26.680
But he spent some time talking about the crisis of modernity and the crisis of modernity.

01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:28.280
Have you heard about that idea before?

01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:35.720
I think I've heard it in vague terms, but I don't think I know what it means.

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:42.360
It's basically the idea that we have reached the limit of enlightenment thinking.

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:46.520
You know, the enlightenment came about because we realized, oh, we can use rationality to

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:47.080
figure out the world.

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:49.160
We're going to use science, the scientific method.

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:50.280
We're going to use history.

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:51.480
We're going to use languages.

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:53.960
We're going to use all of the, we're going to, we're not, we're not going to be like

01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:55.720
emotional anymore.

01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:59.640
We're not going to be basing things on honor anymore or on like family tribal structures.

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:02.200
We're going to be rationalistic about both society.

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:02.680
Right.

01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:08.520
And, um, Hegel being a product of the enlightenment, he, he basically predicted

01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:12.760
fascism like over a hundred years before it came about, because he said that the, the

01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:18.520
ultimate rationalistic project would be the, would be the state as God on earth.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:22.440
Since if you, if you're going to construct everything rationalistically, you're going

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:26.120
to plan everything out is going to require the ultimate state and the fascist fully

01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:26.680
embraced that.

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:31.560
So, so fascism was kind of seen as like the natural end of enlightenment thinking.

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:36.440
Um, this is by the way, the main reason that like that, that, that reactionaries view

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:41.720
fascism as left wing, because they will say that liberalism, socialism, and fascism are

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:43.800
all products of the enlightenment.

01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:47.240
And so they're on the left and they're thinking is pre enlightenment.

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:50.680
It's, it's like, it's feudalism, it's monarchy, it's from before the enlightenment.

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:52.520
So fascism is left wing to them.

01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:59.720
But, but, but basically, um, we actually have reached the, the limits of rationalistic

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:03.160
thinking because we've discovered, um, what's it called?

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:04.040
Hold on.

01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:09.720
Let me just, let me just real quick, uh, on, on that point though.

01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:12.920
Um, okay.

01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:13.640
I've got it.

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:16.360
Um, Godel's incompleteness theorems.

01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:21.800
There are basically two things, uh, very tasking did a great video called, um, the hole

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:22.680
at the bottom of math.

01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:26.520
The idea is basically that there are two things that we know to be true, but we can't

01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:27.080
prove them.

01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:29.080
It is impossible for human logic to prove them.

01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:35.000
And we don't know why, but they are true and they're unprovable and they're like a

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.840
core component deep down in the most complicated parts of mathematics.

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:41.000
We just can't prove them true, but we know that they're true.

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:44.440
So it's like, well, you know, what do you, what do you do with that?

01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:49.240
Um, we've learned similar things about, about science regarding like, we can't truly

01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:52.920
know the position of, of an electron, right?

01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:55.800
We know it's there, but we, but we don't know which way it's spinning.

01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:56.680
We don't know which way it's rotating.

01:49:56.680 --> 01:49:58.840
We don't like, there are just some things that we cannot know.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:05.160
There's, there's a, there's a hard limit on what we can rationalistically, um, figure

01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:09.720
out using human senses and using all of our, using all of our skills and all of our

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:10.120
abilities.

01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:18.200
Um, and this is, this is basically the, you can read a lot of people who are anti-liberal

01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:21.960
like, like a lot of the fascist writers, a lot of the socialist writers, a lot of, a

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:26.200
lot of these, these, these political theorists and they all independently come to the same

01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:27.000
conclusion.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:31.880
And that conclusion ultimately is that, um, ideology doesn't matter at all.

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:37.400
It's just, it's all just like a post hoc justification for uses of power.

01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:41.160
So liberal socialists and fascists will all do the same thing, given the exact same

01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:43.400
historical material conditions.

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:48.440
And they just use their ideologies to disguise their, their, to legitimize their use of

01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:48.760
power.

01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:52.520
And I don't believe that by the way, but that's how, that's how these people view it.

01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:56.200
And, and they, they get to this point of view because it's a crisis.

01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:57.240
It's like a crisis of meaning.

01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:01.560
Basically, there's, there's nothing underneath any of it.

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:07.320
It sounds very nihilistic, but it's like, there's no foundation to any of our beliefs.

01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:09.960
And so the bottom has fallen out.

01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:10.920
There's no God.

01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:11.720
God won't catch us.

01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:14.280
Cause now we, we, you know, God is dead and he said, God is dead.

01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.640
So there's, there's like, there's nothing.

01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:16.680
And it's like, well, what do we do?

01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:18.920
Oh, lots of people say it's all just power.

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:21.880
It's just political power at the end of the day and power is all that matters.

01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:25.480
I don't believe that, but it's a very seductive argument.

01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:26.520
Crote's video is very good on it.

01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.640
You should, you should watch it for sure.

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:30.600
Sorry for the, sorry for the rant.

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:30.840
Sorry.

01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:33.000
No, it's really interesting.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.040
It's fascinating.

01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:38.600
Um, uh, is that his most recent video critique?

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:40.760
A critique of realism.

01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:42.120
Yeah.

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.000
Is that still the most recent video?

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:45.960
I think it is.

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:46.440
I think so.

01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:46.760
Yeah.

01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:47.480
Three weeks ago.

01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:48.440
Yeah.

01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:57.960
Um, uh, interesting that you say that cause, um, I remember also that conversation yesterday

01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:03.560
that, that Spencer and, and destiny were having, having, and, and, uh, Spencer said

01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:10.840
that like liberal, is it liberalism that he said was a, was a, was a donut.

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:12.440
Yes.

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:14.040
With nothing in the center.

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:15.720
He said liberalism's a donut.

01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:19.400
It offers people nothing to actually hold on to because it has no prescriptions.

01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:21.400
There's probably some truth to that.

01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:25.400
If you think about it, I think, I think what he meant by that, it was something like,

01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:29.960
it's something like, okay, maybe, maybe it's more libertarianism than liberalism,

01:52:29.960 --> 01:52:33.720
but like definitely, you know, if you, you know, what, what is the argument for

01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:34.920
decriminalizing pot?

01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:36.600
Well, it doesn't hurt me if you're just doing it to yourself.

01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:37.240
It doesn't matter.

01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:37.880
Right.

01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:41.560
That's a decent argument for a commonizing pot, but like, you can take that logic to

01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:42.440
some pretty dark roads.

01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:45.400
You can say it for like meth for heroin.

01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:47.400
You see people destroying their lives in the streets.

01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:48.440
Like, well, that's not good.

01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:48.920
Right.

01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:49.240
Yeah.

01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:56.040
Um, I think what if all test at one point said that society is just a foundation that

01:52:56.120 --> 01:53:00.040
we all agree to believe in, and then we build on top of that.

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:03.880
But if you don't have the same foundation, you can't, you can't really get along.

01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:04.840
There's something like that.

01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:08.760
It's like, well, we've agreed on this logic and we're going to guide ourselves by this

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:09.080
logic.

01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:10.200
These are going to be our core rules.

01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:13.800
And then from there we can have, you know, as long as we're all playing the same game,

01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:18.360
we can, we can play the game and maybe I win sometimes, maybe you win sometimes we're all

01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:19.320
playing the same game.

01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:22.440
If you're outside the game and you're trying to destroy the game, it's a different type

01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:23.400
of politics altogether.

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:23.880
Yeah.

01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:24.760
You know what I mean?

01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:29.000
So I think, I think that's what he was getting at is something like, I know Sargon wrote

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:34.600
the article, the asset of liberalism, where basically because liberalism has no prescriptions

01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:39.480
and it like, and the progressives kind of morph all culture into like this unified gray

01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:43.080
sludge that where no one's offended and nothing's really distinct anymore.

01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:46.200
I've heard the gray sludge from Spencer before, actually.

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:46.680
Yeah.

01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:47.560
Lots of people have said that.

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:48.040
Yeah.

01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:48.200
Yeah.

01:53:48.520 --> 01:53:57.480
It's just this, this, it's this idea that because, you know, if you talk to a liberal,

01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:59.160
they'll say, well, freedom is our virtue.

01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:02.760
And it's like, well, that's a pretty good virtue if you're oppressed, but what virtues

01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:05.960
are there if you're not oppressed, if you don't eat, like you don't eat freedom anymore,

01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:09.320
you know, you're you live in a, in a free society.

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:10.120
What do you do now?

01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:12.280
Liberals don't seem to have an answer for that.

01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:14.680
They don't have like a positive vision they can put forward of the world.

01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:16.280
Well, it's like, well, you should do this.

01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:20.520
Conservatives have that, which is why even though I like, I'm not really, I don't view

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:21.640
myself as a conservative.

01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:24.760
I don't like a conservative politician, especially in, especially in America.

01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:25.880
They're fucking insane.

01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:31.240
But conservative political philosophy is very good because liberalism will, will liberate

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:34.760
you, but it won't tell you what to do with your liberation.

01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:39.080
Conservatives will though conservatives will say, okay, well, maybe you should you know,

01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:44.360
get married and have kids and, you know, work, work a decent job, provide for yourself, build

01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:46.680
something of value to you and those around you.

01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:48.920
It goes, they're all conservative prescriptions, right?

01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:50.200
A liberal wouldn't tell you that stuff.

01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:52.520
Yeah.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.320
I, I, I think, I, I think I've, I've said this a few times.

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:03.320
It's like governments should be liberal and people should be conservative.

01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:05.640
I think it's something like that.

01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:10.520
I was talking to Dylan Burns and he, he took offense at how I worded it, but he ultimately

01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:11.080
agreed with me.

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:15.160
I said, if you're, if you're talking to a young gay man who doesn't know what to do

01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:20.760
with his life, would you tell him to get married to a partner and adopt some kids and be responsible

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:25.240
and have a family and, you know, be a pillar of your community, or would you, would you

01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:29.560
go to the piss guzzling orgies and spread disease around what's better for you?

01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:31.240
You know, you can do both of them.

01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:32.840
You're free, but what's better for you?

01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:35.240
Like clearly the first option is better than the second, right?

01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:36.840
Yeah.

01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:37.960
Yeah.

01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:44.440
So I, I think, yeah, I think, I think you need like a dose of conservatism to go along

01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:46.440
with your liberalism just to give you direction in life.

01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:49.400
Yeah, I can agree with that.

01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:50.920
I can agree with that.

01:55:53.400 --> 01:56:00.120
Yeah, some of these, some of these, you know, ideas are definitely like above my head.

01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:03.880
But they're definitely very interesting.

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:08.360
Kraut's video, man, you'll, I don't know if you want to watch it on stream or anything,

01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:10.440
but it's, it's a really good video to watch.

01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.440
He, he does it better than me.

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:13.000
That's for sure.

01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:18.120
Some of your chat is like, anyone want to write an article in Mr.

01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:19.640
Girl, Lav and Shaylin with me?

01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:24.520
You know, I, I'm not in the destiny orbiter sphere.

01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:26.680
I don't completely know what's going on.

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:29.240
What's the, what's the latest on Mr.

01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:30.840
Girl and Lav and Shaylin?

01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:31.720
Lav and Shaylin.

01:56:32.440 --> 01:56:35.080
We had the call where I yelled at Shaylin.

01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:36.040
She came in screaming.

01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:39.240
And so I, I just like snapped and I started yelling at her and calling her.

01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:40.120
Oh, that's right.

01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:40.620
Yeah.

01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:44.040
He told her to go be a sex doll.

01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:50.680
Yeah, I went a little bit on hinge there, but like, I don't know what it is.

01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:55.800
Like she came in screaming and her voice was just so grating on me.

01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:58.840
And usually it takes me a lot to push me to the edge.

01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:07.160
But that night, her coming in and screaming was, it was just, it just took me there.

01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:10.440
I just started seeing red and I couldn't help myself.

01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:18.520
And I started yelling at her and yeah, I just lost my cool, you know, hate to see it, but

01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:20.520
I thought it was really funny.

01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:21.400
I remember seeing that now.

01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:21.640
Yeah.

01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:23.320
I thought it was really funny.

01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:23.880
Oh man.

01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:30.600
There was, so, you know, I've always considered myself like kind of a, kind of a moderate

01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:33.880
kind of a centrist, um, for a long time.

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:35.960
I called myself Senator left like eight years ago.

01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:39.400
I don't, I no longer feel comfortable calling myself Senator left because the left's gone

01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:44.120
fucking nuts, you know, and plus people who are, who are truly on the socialist left,

01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:45.640
they think I'm a fascist anyway, so fuck it.

01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:47.880
You know, I don't, I don't owe these people anything.

01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:53.640
Um, but like I've seen some people in my chat or sorry, not in my chat, in, in my comments,

01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:55.720
they're like devs turning leftward.

01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:58.600
So he can, he can try to be the next destiny orbiter.

01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:02.600
And I'm like, you know, I've, I've had the, the permission is to go into destiny stream

01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:03.480
for like six months now.

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:04.680
And I haven't used them.

01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:09.880
I can use them once, you know, and you know, I'm, I'm not as big as destiny, but I'm about

01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:11.800
like 20% destiny size.

01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:15.320
When I fire up a stream, I can get like maybe 500, maybe a thousand for a political stream.

01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:16.440
It's not, it's not bad numbers.

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:16.920
Right.

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:20.600
So like, I don't, I don't need, I no offense to destiny.

01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:22.520
He's not going to watch us, but no offense to him anyway.

01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:24.280
But I don't, I don't like need the bump.

01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:25.080
Does that make sense?

01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:30.360
So there are people who are like, I can't believe you're trying to like, like, like

01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:31.480
a court DGG.

01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:33.400
I'm like, I'm not, I'm really not.

01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:37.480
You don't need to be a left-winger to, you don't need to be a left-winger to be an orbiter

01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:37.800
either.

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:41.720
I mean, like, uh, you know, I'm pretty sure that they're, you know, they're people who

01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:44.520
don't align with him on stuff.

01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:49.880
Um, I, I, I'm pretty sure like I kind of more identify as like a neoliberal, I think.

01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:55.720
You know, I think, uh, I don't know what I identify as, but, um, but, you know, I think

01:58:55.720 --> 01:59:01.000
there's like a communist chick, um, you know, there's, yeah, yeah, there's a communist chick

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:02.840
who, who joins the calls.

01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:10.680
Um, you know, there are people of different political, um, different political, you know,

01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:12.520
leanings, counterpoint is in there.

01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:12.840
Right.

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:14.520
Cause he's, he's a conservative in there.

01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:14.840
Yeah.

01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:15.000
Yeah.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.800
He's a conservative or he's center, right.

01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:18.520
You know?

01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:20.360
So, yeah.

01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:24.040
Um, isn't ABBA also kind of conservative too?

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:28.600
He strikes ABBA is, I think he's more apolitical.

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:33.240
Um, yeah, maybe, maybe.

01:59:35.240 --> 01:59:40.120
But yeah, sometimes like I, sometimes I get a bit tired of just the constant drama that

01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:42.520
comes into that community, but sometimes it's fun to watch.

01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:44.440
Sometimes it's fun to watch just a good show.

01:59:45.960 --> 01:59:46.200
Yeah.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:47.240
Yeah.

01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:52.520
Um, Destiny even said Connor was his star opposition right now.

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:53.080
That's fake.

01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:53.560
Is that true?

01:59:54.360 --> 02:00:02.280
Oh, I, uh, I, I haven't like, maybe this is, I don't know how I want to word this carefully.

02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:07.800
I wouldn't mind talking to Connor, but one, I don't know if you want to talk to me and

02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.160
two, I don't know what we talk about.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:11.560
I'm not sure.

02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:13.800
He's a really cool guy.

02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:15.480
I get along with him really well.

02:00:15.480 --> 02:00:19.480
Um, yeah, yeah.

02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:20.760
He's very, very cool.

02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:22.760
Um, uh, you'd probably get along with him.

02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:23.560
Yeah.

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:24.440
But yeah, I don't know.

02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:25.880
I don't know what you guys would talk about.

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:27.880
Yeah.

02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:28.600
I don't, I don't know.

02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:29.720
I don't know either.

02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:33.160
Um, was there any more gamer gate stuff to talk about?

02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:38.600
There probably is, but I'm probably going to have to like, look and read more on it

02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:40.360
and then come back at you with stuff.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:41.640
Yeah.

02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:41.960
Yeah.

02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:43.400
There's so much.

02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:45.640
Who was, oh God.

02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:45.800
Yeah.

02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:48.360
There's so many old names that I just remember now.

02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:50.200
You know, like there's this person is Margaret.

02:00:50.200 --> 02:00:51.400
Plus who is Margaret plus?

02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:53.080
Oh yeah.

02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:53.640
Some nutter.

02:00:57.640 --> 02:00:58.600
Alistair Pinsoff.

02:00:58.600 --> 02:00:59.400
Oh fuck that.

02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:00.600
Oh, hold on.

02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:01.960
I almost remembered who that was.

02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:09.640
Somebody says, talk the Anita Sarkeesian edge.

02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:12.280
Anita Sarkeesian.

02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:14.280
Talk the Anita.

02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:16.280
What do you mean by the Anita Sarkeesian edge?

02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:17.160
Yeah.

02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.200
I don't know what that means.

02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:20.760
Um,

02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:25.720
Oh no, uh, Alistair Pinsoff.

02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:31.880
He was like, uh, he was, he was, um, he was part of, uh, was it destructoid?

02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:32.120
Yeah.

02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:35.960
There was only one gaming outlet that was pro gamer gate at the time.

02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:38.840
And that was, um, that was the escapist.

02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:46.440
And they got, like, they got fucking cut off from everyone because of their pro gamer gate stance.

02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:46.840
That's right.

02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:47.160
Yeah.

02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:51.720
February 13, a movie, Bob was fired from the escapist.

02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:53.560
Wow.

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:59.080
Um, what have you been thinking about all the Islam stuff recently?

02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:03.000
Oh, like all the destiny shit posting about Islam.

02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:05.080
I mean, it's funny.

02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:05.560
Right.

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:06.920
I mean, it's funny.

02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:07.480
Right.

02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:11.720
But I mean, I remember like duking it out with Muslims 10 years ago and it was the same stuff,

02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:16.200
like death threats constantly, just, you know, claims of being Islamophobic.

02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:21.080
It's like, when I first came onto the internet, the first people I ended up in,

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:24.040
like interacting and arguing with were like funding Muslims.

02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:29.880
Half of them were funding Muslims and half of them were like, uh, super far right people.

02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:34.600
Um, and they were kind of, they kind of interacted with each other a lot

02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:39.240
and they hated each other, even though most of the views that they had were very similar.

02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:42.120
So, um, yeah.

02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:42.360
Yeah.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.480
Well, I mean, I remember 10 years ago, you know, conservatives would not like the comparison with

02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:52.520
Sharia law, presumably because of, you know, the war on terror.

02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:54.520
And now they're like, oh, it's pretty based actually.

02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:55.320
It's like, yeah, guys.

02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:55.800
Yeah.

02:02:59.480 --> 02:02:59.800
Yeah.

02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:01.880
The, um, oh yeah.

02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:04.440
Ethan Ralph got started in gamer gate too.

02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:05.080
Did you know that?

02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:06.680
Yeah, I didn't know that.

02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:06.920
Yeah.

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:11.480
He, he wrote, he, he wrote some articles right on it.

02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:12.520
That's how we got started.

02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:13.800
Yep.

02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:16.040
He and I were friends at one point, way back in the day.

02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:19.640
He like, you're still cool.

02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:25.160
Kind of, but hold on away from, I'm trying to stay away from that.

02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:29.560
Um, didn't he like get your channel blasted off the internet?

02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:31.880
I don't know who was him specifically,

02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:35.720
but it was definitely like one of his super fans that had it happen.

02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:43.400
There are old logs of Ralph participating in getting channels taken down during gamer gate.

02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:44.840
So like, I would not be surprised.

02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:46.280
He's always done this shit.

02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:48.440
He's like, he's always done this shit.

02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:49.560
Yeah.

02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:54.200
I mean, I still think he's an interesting guy.

02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:56.600
Oh, for sure.

02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:56.840
Yeah.

02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:58.040
He's really funny.

02:03:58.040 --> 02:03:59.480
He's always got something going on.

02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:00.760
He's very funny.

02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:02.280
He's a great entertainer.

02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:03.480
He's an excellent entertainer.

02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:06.360
Say what you will about him, but he knows how to entertain an audience.

02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:13.640
To the point where even his hate watchers like are tuning in because they're entertained by the guy.

02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:17.240
Um, I mean, yeah.

02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:18.120
Yeah.

02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:18.920
Here's the thing though.

02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:21.880
Like he, he got Sargon banned off Patreon.

02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:25.240
He helped get crowd ban banned off the internet for a while.

02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:27.640
Like he's, he's fucked over.

02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:31.880
Like every he he's, he's rather apolitical when it comes to who he fucks over.

02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:33.640
He fucks over everyone all the time.

02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:36.680
You know, if he can do it, he will.

02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:42.280
So I'm actually just going to see real quick.

02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:44.120
Where does this timeline end?

02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:49.960
Oh, 2022.

02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:50.440
That's right.

02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:54.200
David de Pape attacks Paul Pelosi with a hammer.

02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:56.760
He describes himself as radicalized by gamer gate.

02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:58.280
Jesus.

02:04:59.400 --> 02:04:59.960
Yeah.

02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:00.440
Wow.

02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:02.120
Fucking hell, man.

02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:11.320
Yeah, I see 2021 January brand new states in the aftermath of 2021 United States Capitol attack that.

02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:18.600
Everything I tried to get the FBI to act on in the aftermath of gamer gate has now come true.

02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:23.400
We told people that have social media companies like Facebook and Reddit did not tighten their

02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:28.360
policies about these communities organized hate that we are going to see violent insurrection

02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:29.720
in the United States.

02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:33.240
We told people that these communities were organizing online for violence and extremism

02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:36.760
that unfortunately has proven to be true.

02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:41.800
Interesting.

02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:44.860
Yep.

02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:49.500
Tech rafter describes gamer gate as an insane alt-right hate group.

02:05:50.620 --> 02:05:51.100
I don't know.

02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:59.500
It seems like gamer gate was had so many moving parts.

02:05:59.500 --> 02:06:02.220
It's not accurate to call it a group of any type.

02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:04.140
Yeah, yeah.

02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:08.620
There was definitely people from all across the political spectrum that were engaged in it.

02:06:08.620 --> 02:06:10.220
There were definitely some harassers.

02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:13.420
There were definitely some people who were just looking to make a name for themselves.

02:06:14.380 --> 02:06:17.020
There were people, there were there were right-leaning people who just wanted to

02:06:17.020 --> 02:06:18.300
fuck with the feminists.

02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:22.460
They were left-leaning people who saw this as a stab in the back from progressives who

02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:25.580
should have had their back, but those progressives ended up being corrupt.

02:06:25.580 --> 02:06:28.540
So like there, it was all sorts of things all at once.

02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:29.040
Yeah.

02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:32.220
Who is this editor of tech?

02:06:32.220 --> 02:06:32.380
Yeah.

02:06:32.380 --> 02:06:35.420
Tech rafter was very pro gamer gate back in the day.

02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:37.900
And they've always been like pretty chill.

02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:42.060
I wonder if they, if they had a new editor that like, or like if they just change their views.

02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:48.700
Oh, it says here, tech rafter announces a complete removal of all gamer gate articles,

02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:52.220
citing that they violated journalistic ethic of do no harm

02:06:52.220 --> 02:06:53.980
by writing the articles in the first place.

02:06:53.980 --> 02:06:54.460
Wow.

02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:55.100
What the fuck?

02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:55.900
Yeah.

02:06:55.900 --> 02:06:57.980
I'm not sure that's a journalistic ethics thing.

02:06:57.980 --> 02:06:59.180
Articles do harm all the time.

02:06:59.180 --> 02:06:59.820
It just depends.

02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:01.180
Yeah.

02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:02.220
And it's going to sound strange.

02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:05.820
It's going to sound strange, but like harm isn't,

02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:07.580
sometimes isn't the most important thing, you know?

02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:08.880
Yeah.

02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:10.080
Yeah.

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:11.200
Maybe tech rafters got in.

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:15.680
Cause like, I remember talking to the editor of tech rafter back then,

02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:17.920
and he was a really chill person.

02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:20.080
I mean, you know, editors change out all the time, right?

02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:21.120
Like people who run sites.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:22.560
So who knows?

02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:23.680
Maybe they just go in a new direction.

02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:26.400
That's that's, that's their business, I guess.

02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:28.400
Hmm.

02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:34.720
Um, I, there was something on my mind, but I can't remember what it was.

02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:38.080
Oh yeah, that's right.

02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:43.040
I did a video on this fucking Mercedes Carrera ended up sexually abusing her daughter.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:44.640
Fuck.

02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:45.680
Yikes.

02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:47.440
Oh, that's so disgusting.

02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:49.520
Do you know who Mercedes Carrera is?

02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:52.160
I don't know who that is, but so disgusting.

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:55.360
She's a porn star who got in on the whole gamer gate thing.

02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:58.880
And she, she was talking about it back in 2014.

02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:05.120
And, um, basically it came out in 2019

02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:07.680
that she had been molesting her daughter.

02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:11.600
Ew, that's so gross.

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:12.800
Yeah, she's still behind bars.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.440
She probably will be for a very long time.

02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:17.760
Yeah, I hope she's there for life.

02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:22.560
Something like, I must admit, I have watched her porn.

02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:25.760
So something changed between 2014 and 2019.

02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:30.560
Like she was clearly beginning to use drugs or something because something changed radically

02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:33.520
in how she looked and it wasn't just aging, you know?

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:38.000
She always kind of had like that Latina MILF thing going on because she's like, she's tall.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.840
She's, she's very wide hipped.

02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.440
So she, she had like a niche in porn.

02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:45.840
And in 2014, she was really like making money off that niche for sure.

02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:50.640
But by 2019, like something had radically changed about, about like the way her face

02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:54.960
looked the way her body looked like, like she would, she, she was using drugs or something.

02:08:55.680 --> 02:09:02.320
Cause yeah, drugs don't make you don't make you feel.

02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:03.760
I know drugs don't make you a pedo.

02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:04.160
I know that.

02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:10.800
I know that chat, but like she had gone down some kind of rabbit hole for sure.

02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:15.440
Yeah.

02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:16.000
Oh man.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.600
I'm trying to remember what it was that I was going to bring up, but I can't remember.

02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:25.120
I mean, I can always bring it up at another time, I guess.

02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:29.360
Was it about, was it about harm not being the most important thing sometimes?

02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:32.160
No, it was something before that, I think.

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:33.360
Oh, okay.

02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:36.800
Yeah, but that's okay.

02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:38.480
Um, thank you for doing this with me.

02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:40.720
It was super informative.

02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:41.520
Yeah, no problem.

02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:42.720
Are you coming to the end of it?

02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:50.160
Uh, I actually was scrolling in reverse, but yeah, I saw the end of it.

02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:51.360
Um, no, no.

02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:54.160
I meant, are you coming to the end of, of, of our talk?

02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:58.720
Cause I think, I think I'm, yeah, cause I think I'm, I'm at the end of it's, it's not

02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:00.320
it's, it's nearly 10 o'clock for me.

02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:05.680
So I probably have to, uh, I think we've talked as much as we can in one sitting

02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:09.520
about gamer gate, you know, but I learned a lot for sure.

02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:14.000
So, um, I really appreciate you, um, coming on and telling me

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.200
everything that you know about it.

02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:16.480
Oh yeah.

02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:17.120
No, no problem.

02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:17.680
Of course.

02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:18.160
Anytime.

02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:20.800
And I'll definitely have to check out your videos on it too.

02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:21.200
Oh God.

02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:22.240
They're so old, man.

02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:25.840
2014.

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:26.960
It's so bad.

02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:29.120
No, I'm sure it's fine.

02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:33.840
It's good to know like the context and kind of get into that space and get into that.

02:10:33.840 --> 02:10:38.960
Um, you know, like what the internet was like back then, you know, um, if you're

02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:41.520
really trying to get into, like understand it.

02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:46.640
So pretending that, pretending that you're, you're in 2014 again, you know?

02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:46.880
Yeah.

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:47.520
Pretty much.

02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:47.760
Yeah.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.760
Were you, were you online back in 2014?

02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:54.800
2014.

02:10:54.800 --> 02:11:00.320
Um, I think I was, I think I was a workaholic back in 2014.

02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:02.560
I didn't see any friends and I only worked.

02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:09.840
So I didn't, I, there are whole like years of my life where I just spent, uh, working

02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:15.920
myself to the bone and, uh, and didn't partake in any recreational activities.

02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:17.760
So I think that was probably back then.

02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:20.240
When did you, when did you start YouTubing anyway?

02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:24.480
Maybe like two years ago or something like that.

02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:24.720
Okay.

02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:28.080
Was it one of those things where you started it up because of the pandemic?

02:11:28.080 --> 02:11:29.200
Like you had free time now.

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:32.080
So yeah, yeah, it was kind of one of those things.

02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:37.680
And then it ended up taking off because, um, well, I'd always been streaming, but

02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:42.640
the, you know, the, the streaming really took off when I started doing like going

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:45.600
on political panels and things like that.

02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:47.760
And, um, I just kind of kept up with it.

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:52.880
Um, which is weird because I don't think I'm particularly the smartest person in

02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:53.840
the world.

02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:59.040
Um, I don't think that, um, my takes on politics are particularly like

02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:03.280
groundbreaking or anything like that, but people liked what I had to say.

02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:07.680
So, um, it just kind of took off and I just kept doing it.

02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:09.200
But yeah.

02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:14.720
Um, prior to that, I was like complete workaholic.

02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:17.440
I was like the type of person that I was such a workaholic.

02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:21.200
I made everybody else in the company, like look bad or made everybody else that

02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:22.560
worked with me look bad.

02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:24.720
People hated me for it.

02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:30.800
Um, so, uh, and I had, I, I would, I stopped hanging out with friends.

02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:32.400
Cause I was like, I don't know.

02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:33.360
I have a problem.

02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:35.680
Um, I saw, you know, I wouldn't hang out with friends.

02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:37.200
I didn't do anything recreational.

02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:41.440
I would just like work, come home and sleep and then wake up and go work again.

02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:44.000
So it was, yeah.

02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:50.720
With me, I man, I've, I've always joked that I've, I've consistently almost had

02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:55.200
a YouTube career because I've known so many, like I knew JonTron before he was

02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:59.920
big and that's a, that's a whole fucking long story, but like, I knew him before

02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:00.480
he was big.

02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:01.520
I lost contact.

02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:05.440
I regained contact through Sargon because Sargon and JonTron are friends.

02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:08.240
And that was kind of like a weird, Hey, it's been like 10 fucking years.

02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:09.440
How have you been dude?

02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:11.040
So that was like a weird situation.

02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:18.160
Um, there's like a bunch of YouTubers that are, that are pretty big names.

02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:22.240
You know, we're, we're talking like over a million subs for sure that have like

02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:24.880
private messaged me and had been like, Hey, yeah, I secretly watch you.

02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:27.440
Don't tell anyone because I don't want to get canceled, but you know, I watch you

02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:30.640
and I watch Sargon and it's like, well, that's actually kinda, that's cool.

02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:31.200
That's cool.

02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:38.240
Um, and like, I had the idea to do some sort of internet content like a year and

02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:43.280
a half before I started and this, and we started in 2009, so a long time ago,

02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:46.720
completely different internet back then, completely different, everything back

02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:48.240
then.

02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:52.320
And I've always been like, just a few months behind every trend.

02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:56.400
I've always like known people before they got big and then lost contact.

02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:59.440
And it was like, like, it was hard to re to like reconnect with them.

02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:01.040
I lost contact with Sargon for awhile.

02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:03.520
I re-became his friend in like 2017 or something.

02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:08.400
Um, you know, I, I knew shoe on head back in the day.

02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:13.440
Like just, I, I I've, I've always been like on the periphery of people who have

02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:16.560
blown up and I haven't, I've never really blown up myself.

02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:21.840
You know, Sargon gave me a shout out and I got like three, uh, 30,000 subs from it.

02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:22.720
That was pretty good.

02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:24.320
I got another 30,000 from gamer gate.

02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:25.440
That was pretty good.

02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:29.440
But for like, for the most part, it's just been like a long, slow grind.

02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:34.800
I kind of anticipate it's going to be a long slow grind for me as well.

02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:41.280
So, um, unless you want, unless you, unless you really want to milk that DGG

02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:42.240
connection.

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:42.480
Yeah.

02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:43.920
I don't know.

02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:48.480
Like, uh, like I feel guilty doing it, but like, there's not a time that would

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:52.480
be more relevant than right now while he's doing the whole anti Muslim arc,

02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:53.200
you know?

02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:57.920
Um, but, uh, you know, I, I kind of feel guilty.

02:14:57.920 --> 02:15:06.000
I wish I had like the, uh, blatant, I don't know, like, uh, um,

02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:11.600
there's some people who are just like really good at just milking it.

02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:13.280
And I'm just not one of those people.

02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:19.840
Um, but right now, everything that's happening is like super relevant to the

02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:21.920
things that I think about in my head.

02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:24.800
And also I was doing okay.

02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:26.640
I, I talked to Spencer first.

02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:27.120
Okay.

02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:28.240
Before Destiny did.

02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:28.960
Okay.

02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:32.320
Uh, you know, and I don't see him getting the same amount of shit.

02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:32.960
All right.

02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:33.920
That's all I'm saying.

02:15:34.480 --> 02:15:36.960
Yeah, that was, I, I saw that was pretty bullshit.

02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:39.760
Like the amount of the amount that mind waves went after you for that.

02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:41.760
And then just doesn't say a thing to destiny.

02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:43.120
Yeah.

02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:45.360
I've told you my opinion on that in private though already.

02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:45.840
Yeah.

02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:46.400
Yeah.

02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:51.360
And then, and then, you know, then the, the, uh, you know, obviously the whole

02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:57.200
anti-Islam arc is like, okay, I just debated some Muslims like a few days ago.

02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:02.480
And now the whole anti-Islam arc that is happening, like, man, everything is so

02:16:02.480 --> 02:16:08.400
relevant right now, but when I get onto a stream with the, with the dude, like he is

02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:09.840
so bad at conversation.

02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:17.200
So, uh, Oh, someone in your chest says it's because mind waves wants to kiss

02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:18.480
destiny on the lips.

02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:20.240
Yeah, probably.

02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:20.880
Yeah.

02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:23.280
He doesn't want to lose that DGG connection.

02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:23.840
Yeah.

02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:24.560
Yeah.

02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:29.200
I'm very grateful for the connection, but yeah, it's like, I, I only want to jump

02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:31.360
onto a stream if I really have something to say.

02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:33.840
And then most of the time when I have something to say, there's already like

02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:36.240
five people on, so I can't get a word in.

02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:39.520
And then when I, when I do have something to say and there aren't five

02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:43.360
people on, I come on and they say something and then that's it.

02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:44.640
Yeah.

02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:45.040
Yeah.

02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:47.920
I fucking hate panels for that reason.

02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:50.560
Like you never really, like you never really discussed the idea.

02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:51.360
You never really drill down.

02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:54.720
It's everyone, like everyone gives their surface level takes and everyone like

02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:56.640
go round Robins a bit.

02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:00.480
Maybe there's some drama where two people fight, but like, you don't really

02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:01.760
discuss an idea.

02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:03.280
Not really on a panel.

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:05.040
It's kind of why, why I hate him.

02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:06.160
Like at some point, man.

02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:07.440
Okay.

02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:10.160
So I have, I have two videos coming up that you might like.

02:17:10.160 --> 02:17:11.920
And one of them, one of them is the Gramsci video.

02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:17.040
The other one is, was fascism actually capitalism and decay?

02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:23.040
Because the answer to that is like 90% no, and leftists love to say that they'd

02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:23.600
love to say that.

02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:28.960
And it's, it's just not true, but like that's just a result of reading and

02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:31.520
reading and reading and reading and reading and understanding some of these

02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:34.880
ideas, but I could never find anybody who actually, who would actually debate

02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:35.200
that.

02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:35.360
Right.

02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:38.880
Like I've, I've heard like Lance from the surf say that like 80 times.

02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:41.120
I don't think he would ever talk to me his entire life.

02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:43.920
You know, Xander hall ducked out of a debate with me.

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:49.760
So there's just like the part of the reason why I make the videos in the style

02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:55.680
that I make them is because I've like, I've like learned the socialist position

02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:56.720
on a lot of these things.

02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:01.040
And it's like, well, I know how to counter this and I'm never going to talk to

02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:02.800
them because they fucking hate me.

02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:04.560
So I'll just make like a long ass video about it.

02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:08.400
You know, I'll just do like a, I'll just do a deep dive and I'll reference like

02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:10.160
books instead because fuck it.

02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:11.840
Yeah.

02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:23.600
Um, I think we've reached, I think we've like milked this as much as we can.

02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:25.200
I think so too.

02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:26.560
I think so too.

02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:27.600
But it was super fun.

02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:28.960
We should do this again soon.

02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:31.680
Like in the next few days.

02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:34.080
I mean, I'm, you see me in your chat a fair amount.

02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:38.480
So like, you know, when I'm around, I, I don't know if you prefer scheduling

02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:39.200
things or not.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.040
It doesn't matter to me.

02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:43.920
Like if you want to just have like a random hour to talk, I'll pop in for a

02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:44.080
bit.

02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:45.760
That's okay with me if you want.

02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:51.280
Cause I'm usually around things cause I'm super disorganized, but you know,

02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:52.320
but yeah.

02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:54.800
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:58.720
You know, I'm also not against doing things like impromptu as well.

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:03.120
It's just good for me to schedule things cause I'll forget otherwise.

02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:04.080
So yeah.

02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:05.040
Okay.

02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:10.480
Well, if you, if you, if you actually want my videos, the playlist on my

02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:13.520
channel, the playlist on my channel is called indefensible.

02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:17.680
The first like 10 videos or so are gamer gate related past that it's just like

02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:22.160
other gaming topics because it's just like, as, as time went on, I started

02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:24.000
doing other gaming videos and I just put them in the same place.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.040
It's all gaming related.

02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:26.800
It's not like philosophy related.

02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:32.000
So indefensible is the, indefensible is, is the playlist.

02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:33.440
Yeah.

02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:36.160
I mean the pun is indefensible, but it's indie.

02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:38.240
Yeah.

02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:38.800
Yeah.

02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:42.320
So like that's my playlist, just some ancient ass videos on there.

02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:46.480
Um, uh, that's right.

02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:48.400
The, the, uh, fucking word.

02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:48.800
Where is it?

02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:49.120
Where is it?

02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:50.000
Where is it?

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:50.560
Yeah.

02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:55.600
The know your meme page on gamer gate on Zoe Quinn on, on like the principal

02:19:55.600 --> 02:20:00.560
players know your meme is really good for like documenting lots of old lore.

02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:01.600
They're a great resource.

02:20:02.160 --> 02:20:06.240
So if you want to see like the pro the explicitly pro gamer gate position,

02:20:06.240 --> 02:20:09.040
know your meme has it, they have like their timeline.

02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:16.480
Um, and I guess otherwise like try to dig up old internet aristocrat gamer gate

02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:19.760
videos, they're going to be on like a gym archive channel somewhere.

02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:21.440
You know, his stuff.

02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:23.280
I don't think I can watch a gym.

02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:28.240
I don't think I can watch gym on like, like, uh, on stream.

02:20:28.240 --> 02:20:32.880
I think it might be, he's, he uses a lot of slurs with me, at least his recent stuff.

02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:35.440
He, I know that he uses a lot of slurs.

02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:38.240
So yeah, I think he did back then too.

02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:38.740
Yeah.

02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:41.120
But good resource.

02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:41.920
Good resource.

02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:48.960
Um, and yeah, I guess, uh, unrelated to gamer gate, you know, Croats realism video.

02:20:48.960 --> 02:20:49.600
Got to watch that.

02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:50.560
It's great.

02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:52.880
And I think, I think I recommended to you last time.

02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:54.000
Uh, what if alt hissed?

02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:57.120
He does great videos in the same style of crowd.

02:20:57.760 --> 02:20:59.680
What is alt hissed?

02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:00.080
Okay.

02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:00.580
Yeah.

02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:09.200
He's he's, he's also a conservative, but he's, um, he's not that he's not biased.

02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:10.720
Also, he dumpstered Vosh in a debate.

02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:11.680
It was fucking hilarious.

02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:14.480
Take a look at this.

02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:15.120
Yeah.

02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:20.800
Uh, uh, uh, there was, uh, that's, he reacted to it where basically Vosh said,

02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:24.720
well, can you describe Simone de Beauvoir her, her writing?

02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:25.680
He's like, oh yeah, of course he does.

02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:28.240
He starts launching into it and Vosh is like, uh, oh sure.

02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:32.240
Like he, it was fucking, do you remember seeing that?

02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:34.000
That's I don't remember seeing that.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:34.500
Okay.

02:21:35.040 --> 02:21:39.520
It was like, basically Vosh was trying to like out intellect him and he knew exactly

02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:44.400
what the writing was and Vosh just like chose a random name and it did not fucking play

02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:45.280
out well for him.

02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:48.240
It sounds so similar to somebody we know.

02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:51.760
Um, I wonder where president Sunday got his mannerisms.

02:21:51.760 --> 02:21:52.320
Oh fuck.

02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:53.120
Oh fuck.

02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:57.200
Um, what, yeah, what if all test he's, he has his problems, but he's like, he's a good

02:21:57.200 --> 02:21:57.760
center, right.

02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:01.840
Resource when it comes to like history and philosophy, just, just, just, just, just

02:22:01.840 --> 02:22:04.000
remember his bias, but he's still pretty good.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:04.640
Yeah.

02:22:04.640 --> 02:22:05.140
Yeah.

02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:05.920
Yeah.

02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:06.160
Yeah.

02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:09.600
I think I'm going to have to do more reading on like some of these like social issues.

02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:16.240
Cause I clearly don't have the vocabulary to like, to like vocalize what I'm observing

02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:16.960
half the time.

02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:22.400
I feel, but, um, yeah, I can't, I can't feel that that way sometimes too.

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:24.880
That way you're way better than I am.

02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:25.920
You think so?

02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:27.280
Yeah, I think so.

02:22:27.280 --> 02:22:28.800
You've got all the reading.

02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:32.880
I, yeah, but I stutter and stumble over everything and I can't like, I can talk on a script

02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:34.800
decently, but I can't, I can't do streams.

02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:37.920
It seems sometimes I'm always just like stuttering and like, what do I mean?

02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:38.400
Oh, fuck.

02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:39.840
Yeah.

02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:40.720
I think you're really great.

02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:46.160
I, I, I, for me, it's like, I don't even have the vocabulary to even like, when I'm talking

02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:51.200
about these things feel like they're kind of theoretical or something, or they feel

02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:52.800
like they're kind of abstract.

02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:58.480
And, um, and I just don't have, I don't have the vocabulary to accurately explain them

02:22:58.480 --> 02:22:59.040
fully.

02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:05.840
Um, like when we were talking about like, you know, individualism versus like, you know,

02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:10.560
this multiculturalist like world, you know, um, and things like that.

02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:16.000
Like, I don't know, these feel like things that I struggle for words, uh, with when I'm

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:22.240
trying to describe them, but I don't know, maybe I just don't have enough like words

02:23:22.240 --> 02:23:24.000
in my vocabulary or something.

02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:26.480
I, I can sit with this.

02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:28.160
I feel that way about myself a lot too.

02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:31.600
Um, okay.

02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:33.200
I think, I think that's about it though.

02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:36.080
So if you want to talk again, we can talk again.

02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:36.960
I'm usually around.

02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:39.040
It's not hard to, it's not hard to get ahold of me.

02:23:39.840 --> 02:23:40.080
Yeah.

02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:43.840
Let me, um, let me do some more diving into the gamer gate stuff and then I'll hit you

02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:45.600
up about like talking again.

02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:46.960
Sure.

02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:47.360
Sure.

02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:47.920
Yeah.

02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:49.360
Maybe we can go through like that.

02:23:49.920 --> 02:23:54.240
You know, I think it's, I think it's super useful for me, like to go through the thing

02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:58.880
that's slanted against gamer gate, since you're, you seem like you're pretty pro gamer gate.

02:23:58.880 --> 02:23:59.520
Yeah, I was.

02:23:59.520 --> 02:23:59.840
Yeah.

02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:00.880
And yeah.

02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:04.880
And then maybe I can do the same thing with like somebody who is anti gamer gate and like

02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:08.800
go through something that's pro gamer, like a pro gamer gate timeline with somebody who's

02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:09.520
anti gamer gate.

02:24:09.520 --> 02:24:10.320
That would be kind of cool.

02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:14.000
I mean, you could probably, maybe Brandon would do it with you.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:14.400
I don't know.

02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:15.680
Yeah.

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:20.880
I don't know how many she, she would do, you know, I don't know how many, um, how many

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:23.920
like sessions she would do with me, you know?

02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:24.240
Yeah.

02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:25.840
I don't know if that's fun for other people.

02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:27.600
I know it's fun for me, but you know.

02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:29.280
Yeah.

02:24:30.800 --> 02:24:32.320
Uh, but yeah, I'll, I'll be around.

02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:34.480
It's not hard to figure out where I am.

02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:37.120
So yeah, I'll see you next time.

02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:37.360
Okay.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:38.960
See you next time.

02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:40.400
Thanks for joining Dev.

02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:40.880
Have a good night.

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:41.680
No problem.

02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:42.000
See ya.

02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:43.120
Bye.

02:24:45.440 --> 02:24:47.040
I'm going to be real with you, SFO.

02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:55.040
I looked up mold bug and, um, and I was like, bro, some of the stuff that this dude is saying

02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:56.160
is a little bit based.
