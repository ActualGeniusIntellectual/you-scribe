0	500	Hello?
2700	3900	Hello, how's it going?
4500	5800	Hey, how's it going?
7800	8400	Pretty good.
8400	9300	I'm just really busy.
10400	10800	Hold on.
11000	11800	I just got a stretch.
14200	15500	Okay, what's going on?
15500	18500	Hey, your camera on Discord looks really different than your
18500	20000	camera on the stream.
20000	20400	What happened?
20400	21100	Yeah, I fucked it up.
21100	21400	Sorry.
21400	22400	Give me a second here.
31000	34800	Hello, welcome to the stream.
36200	36900	How are you doing?
38300	39300	Very good.
39300	40300	Very well.
40300	42300	I've just been I've been doing a lot of writing and reading.
42300	46000	My next project is on Antonio Gramsci.
46000	50600	So I mean, it's you can't read the entire prison notebooks
50600	52100	in, you know, two days.
52100	55200	It's like a 500 page book, but
55200	61000	I don't know if you know who who's is it socked on left
61000	62000	soaked on left.
62100	65700	Yeah, he's kind of an idiot a lot of the time.
66200	67300	I don't know if you agree with me.
68200	70100	I don't know enough about the stuff he talks about that
70100	70800	really knows.
70900	71400	Okay.
71800	75600	Now he made some some of these stupid claims about
75600	78800	Antonio Gramsci like a week ago and I've been putting off
79000	82100	doing my video on the prison notebooks for about six months
82100	84800	mainly at a laziness and I was like, you know what it's it's
84800	85900	kind of time to talk about it.
85900	89700	I think because you know who Gramsci is?
90700	91500	Yeah, I do.
91500	91800	Yeah.
92000	97400	Okay, you know that a lot of right oids on the internet tend
97400	98700	to misquote him.
99900	102200	Do you know what that I don't know about that?
102200	102500	No.
102700	103000	Okay.
103000	106500	So there's a very famous Gramsci quote floating around
106500	111000	it turns out it's actually not from Gramsci and the entire
111000	113900	right wing ecosystem is kind of built off this quote.
114400	117700	However, even though Gramsci didn't say the quote he said
117700	120800	stuff in his writing that is enough like it that it's pretty
120800	121700	much accurate.
122100	126400	So I'm gonna go over what he what he said what soaked and
126400	128900	left said was correct and also and but and ultimately where
128900	129500	he's wrong.
129800	132500	So that's that's a big project that I'm working on right
132500	132700	now.
132700	136900	Yeah, sounds like it sounds like it and that'll be that'll
136900	139800	be out probably next week or so very cool.
140200	143000	I mean you've watched my videos now you notice that like
143000	147400	some of them just have like the the fat laughing dev background.
148000	150200	Those are like my less serious videos.
150200	153400	And then the more serious ones are more edited like the
153400	154600	three forms of fascism.
154900	156300	This one's going to be a more edited one.
156700	157800	So that's cool.
157800	161200	Yeah, your forms of fascism one was really good.
161300	163300	So yeah, I get a lot of compliments on it.
164600	167100	There are people who really didn't like it because they
167100	169900	thought the idea of libertarian fascism is stupid.
169900	172700	It is a stupid idea, but people do believe it, you know people
172700	174100	believe a lot in a lot of stupid ideas.
174500	176100	Yeah, for sure.
177000	179900	Well post me post that I'm talking to you somewhere.
179900	180600	Give me a second.
181000	181200	Yeah.
181200	181500	Yeah.
181500	181800	Yeah.
181800	188600	We're here to talk about gamergate chat educate me on
188600	189300	gamergate.
189300	189500	Now.
189500	191500	I've already looked at some of the stuff around it.
191500	192100	Oh my God.
192100	196700	Why do I have Nikkato avocados ass on my on my God, Jesus
196700	197100	Christ.
198900	201500	I did some reading about it.
202300	206400	So like I have the timeline of gamergate, you know pulled
206400	206600	up.
206600	211800	I've been kind of going through that but I guess yeah,
212100	216900	you're going to educate me on gamergate God the ancient
216900	218100	lore of gamergate.
218100	219900	It's been like 10 fucking years.
220500	223300	Yeah, so sorry.
223300	223600	Go ahead.
223600	224000	Go ahead.
225100	229800	So it all started with this Zoe Quinn this post about Zoe
229800	230600	Quinn, right?
231000	232000	Did you read the post?
232100	232900	I think it's still up.
233400	235500	Yeah, I read some of it.
235500	239200	I didn't read the entire thing, but basically her ex is
240300	242100	accusing her of cheating, right?
242600	243000	Mm-hmm.
244200	246100	Do you think that she actually cheated on him?
246500	247200	Oh, absolutely.
247400	249400	The guys confirmed it at least three out of the five of them
249400	249700	dead.
249700	250000	Yeah.
252200	255600	Like that part is not in dispute whatsoever that she did
255600	256100	cheat on.
258000	260800	Yeah, so one of them was Nathan Grayson.
261000	263700	Let me just I'm just gonna pull his see what he's doing now.
265600	266600	God this ancient lore.
266600	270500	It's been so fucking long, dude, because what I was reading
270500	276500	I read a bunch of different things but but there were like
276500	280200	allegations that this guy was like abusive or whatever and
280200	285400	that like, I don't know how true that is right that he like
285400	287400	made up a whole bunch of stuff about her.
289000	295600	So I guess I'm curious to to know like I guess how was this
295600	297400	confirmed that she cheated on him?
299800	302700	One of the guys at least of the of the five guys, you know,
302700	305500	there was the five guys burgers and fries meme like that was
305600	306200	I was part of it.
306200	306600	Yeah.
307400	309900	One of the guys was Nathan Grayson and Nathan Grayson said
310000	313800	yes, we had a sexual relationship during during this time.
315800	318800	The issue ultimately wasn't the cheating actually, you know
318800	321000	what here before we get into it, you should you should give
321000	324000	me your view of gamergate like what you've learned about it
324000	326200	what you think of it, you should hit me with the stardust
326200	327300	interpretation first.
327400	329000	I know very little about it.
329000	329800	I'm going to be real with you.
329800	332700	I know very little about I know that basically this post came
332700	333800	out about Zoe Quinn.
334000	337500	I know that it was less about the cheating and more about
338200	343600	about the incestuous relationship that game reporters have
343600	348600	with each other and and with a game developers and and it
348600	351800	was kind of like it was kind of like talking about the
351800	357700	corruption or not corruption, but like, you know, just the
359200	366700	I guess the weirdness of that of that industry and I know
366700	371600	that basically in response to this post being made about
372000	375300	about Zoe Quinn a bunch of report.
375300	379400	I think it was reporters spoke out against it.
380800	381700	Am I correct?
382600	383300	Yes.
383700	389200	Okay, and because they spoke out against it like the majority
389200	392900	of like the gaming world didn't really care about the post
392900	397100	initially, but because they they spoke out against it drew
397100	400000	more attention to it and then more of the gaming world kind
400000	405100	of kind of caught on to it and it became a bigger thing.
406100	412300	And then and then there were like some harassment campaigns
412300	415400	that happened and everything from that point on.
415700	416700	I'm a little bit.
419400	420600	I'm a little bit.
421000	423300	Yeah, I don't know a whole lot beyond that point.
423300	425000	So right, right.
425000	430400	So you're already a far-right fascist for even bringing
430400	431900	up the ethics part of the conversation.
431900	436400	By the way, I hope you know that you've I'm sorry, just
436400	437600	one second wordsmith Andy.
437600	438800	Thank you so much for the super chat.
438800	439400	Sorry, go ahead.
440200	440600	No problem.
440600	441100	No problem.
443900	448400	The issue is that there's two competing narratives regarding
448400	452100	gamergate and it's now nine years ago and most of the people
452100	454900	who were pro gamergate don't care anymore because it's been
454900	456300	nine fucking years, right?
456300	458500	Yeah, like it's it's old internet drama.
459700	463700	If you go to Wikipedia, you can see the anti gamergate
463700	466200	description of events and from their point of view.
466200	467000	It's pretty accurate.
467500	470800	If you go to know your meme, you can see the pro gamergate
470900	471500	view of events.
471500	475700	So if you want to get an overview of what both sides actually
475700	478600	thought and like their versions of the timeline of events,
479100	480700	both of those sources will give it to you.
481700	487200	Um, there's if you were, if you were around in like 2015
487400	492500	or 2016, you saw three things kind of conflated very heavily
492500	494200	together in mainstream news.
494200	498700	And that was gamergate Brexit and Trump that gamergate caused
498700	500900	Brexit and then Brexit caused Trump.
501200	503600	And it was all gamergate cause Brexit.
503600	504900	That makes no sense to me.
505300	505900	I know.
505900	511100	And it's, it's some of the most ridiculous claims that
511100	511700	I have seen.
512300	514600	Or is just how like, okay, here, here, um, you know who
514600	516700	Mundane Matt is his part of the gamergate drama.
518500	521600	Uh, he made a video, right?
521900	522200	Yeah.
522400	525100	He made one of the first videos talking about the Zoe post
525500	528500	and because he was one of the first ones and he was the
528500	532100	one that Zoe Quinn chose to falsely DMCA to get his video
532100	533600	down, he blew up.
533700	535700	Wait, wait, wait, who, who?
536300	538100	Zoe DMC claimed him.
538300	538700	Yes.
539700	543000	Zoe Quinn falsely DMCA'd Mundane Matt to get his video on
543000	544300	the Zoe post taken down.
544900	545300	Okay.
545600	547100	And that's what made Mundane Matt blow up.
547100	549000	And that's what made a whole bunch of YouTubers suddenly
549000	552300	leap all over this story back in 2014, because that was
552300	555100	seen as like an egregious, you know, censorship.
556300	561600	Um, and Mundane Matt has since come out and said, now he's
561600	563100	more progressive now than he was back then.
563200	565600	And he's come out and he said stuff like, Hey, uh,
566200	568300	you know, I, you know, I'm sorry for my part because I
568300	571600	know that it led to, um, to the rise of reactionary politics.
571600	572700	It led to Trump.
572700	573400	It led to Brexit.
573400	574700	It led to all of these things.
574700	579800	And it's like, well, no, no, it didn't, but there is a
579800	581900	narrative that it did, and I can explain that narrative.
581900	583400	I don't really believe it, but I can explain it.
585200	590900	Um, the, the idea basically is, is that there's there, I
590900	593100	don't know if you were, if you were around 10 or 15 years
593100	596000	ago, but there's been like a slow turning leftward of a
596000	599400	lot of online spaces, you know, the, the old atheism of
599400	601500	the two thousands, where everyone's going around, like
601500	604000	just being intentionally edgy and tipping their fedoras
604000	607600	everywhere, those guys became like atheism plus where it
607600	609100	was all social justice focused.
609100	611600	You know, there was, there was like stuff happening in
611600	613700	comics, there was stuff happening in all of these,
613700	615600	these kind of cultural spaces online.
616400	618300	And then when it came, there was stuff happening in gaming
618300	622600	too, there was this general hatred and we're talking
622600	626500	like 2010, 2012, there was this general hatred of games
626500	629500	journalists by gamers at the time for being impartial.
629500	632900	And probably the first brush of it was the mass effect
632900	637600	three, um, the mass effect three ending controversy.
637700	638200	Do you remember that?
638200	639000	Did you hear about that at all?
640600	641100	No, I didn't.
641100	641200	Okay.
641800	642400	So what happened?
642700	646700	Let me just, uh, basically mass effect was like a, this
646700	649000	big trilogy on journal, like the on journey, the Xbox
649000	655100	three 60 times and the ending was absolute shit and gamers
655100	657400	got really mad at the game developers and kind of blew
657400	658200	up at them on Twitter.
658600	660600	This is back in again, like 2012 or something.
661400	664500	And if you like, if you search here, let me just pull
664500	664700	this out.
664700	665100	Where is it?
666000	667000	Where, where, where is it?
667900	668300	Where is it?
671000	675600	Like if you search right now for mass effect three gamer
675600	679100	gate, even though this happened two years before, you
679100	681600	can find people saying that, Oh, this was the beginning
682200	684200	of the same sentiment that caused gamer gate.
684200	687400	You know, these, these gamers wouldn't accept what game
687400	689300	journalists were telling them and what, and what develop
689300	691100	indie developers were telling them and what, you know,
691100	692600	mainstream developers are telling them that they were
692600	694800	just angry and they were reactionary.
695000	697800	And they were these, they didn't use incel cause that
697800	700700	wasn't really a term back then, but, but they would have
700800	703100	cause they used internet virgins, which you can't really
703100	704700	say anymore because that's shaming somebody for their
704700	705300	sexual past.
705700	706900	That's now problematic.
707100	709300	So it was the same kind of idea.
710300	714400	And then there was already this like hatred between your
714400	717100	average gamer who, you know, back then wasn't really popular
717300	719300	games, weren't really that games weren't popular.
719400	721300	People who played them are kind of like derided in their
721300	724500	childhood and they hated these, these, these game journalists.
724500	725200	They already hated them.
725200	728800	So it was already like primed for, for this sort of cultural,
729000	732200	not, not, it's not a rebellion, but it's like a, you know,
732200	733800	we don't, we don't, we're just going to go against you
733800	734400	because we fucking hate you.
734400	735600	It's that, it's that sort of thing, right?
735900	736900	They're already primed for that.
737300	742200	And then when gamer gate happened, you had the two narratives
742200	746900	and the first one was that Zoe Quinn, who was this indie
747100	751400	game developer cheated on her boyfriend and that wasn't
751400	754700	so noteworthy, but she cheated on her boyfriend with five
754700	759800	people who were notable in, in games journalism and that
760100	765700	led to some sort of, some sort of, some sort of like, it's
765700	768400	not toxic, it's like some sort of like, yeah, some sort
768400	770300	of nepotism, some sort of like, like colluded relationship
770300	773600	because earlier Nathan Grayson, one of those guys that,
774000	778400	that had, that had slept with her earlier in the year, he
778400	783000	reported on a game jam that went South involving her and
783000	784300	JonTron was also there.
784600	786700	And JonTron spoken out about this as well, about like his
786700	789600	experiences with like the type of person that Zoe Quinn
789600	793600	is, but basically Zoe Quinn's behavior caused this game
793600	798800	jam to go South and there, and the only like real official
798800	800500	word of what happened there was Nathan Grayson's and
800500	801200	it's like, well, hold on.
801500	806100	Some guy lost like, like, like tens of thousands of dollars
806100	809300	on this project and the only person, the only, the only
809300	812900	person that you're giving the interpretation of events in
812900	815400	the public sphere is the person that you've been having
815400	816700	sex with secretly this whole time.
817200	821000	Well, you know, that sounds like, and also like this guy
821000	823700	who, who hosted this game jam, he got slandered to shit
823700	827100	in the media and he was, he was thinking about like,
827800	832100	like suing these people because his reputation was
832100	835600	destroyed and the guy who destroyed it didn't reveal
835600	838300	that he had sex with, with the other person in the story
838700	840600	who was like his opponent in the story.
841000	841600	You know what I mean?
841700	845600	So it's like, I don't know how actually like in terms
845600	848100	of any, any sort of formal ethics, how unethical it
848100	850600	was, but it certainly felt unethical, especially
850600	851700	because they tried to hide it.
852100	853600	That was the worst part is that they tried to hide it.
854200	857700	Um, so there was, there were these five people and
857700	860220	actually I was heavily involved in, in gamer
860220	861000	gate when it happened.
861800	864200	Um, gamer gate was when my channel went from like
864200	868700	2000 subs to about 15 or 30,000 subs over the course
868700	869500	of like four months.
869900	871900	So like I got my first big bump from them, you
871900	873500	know, before, like before gamer gate, I had done
873500	875800	some anime reviews in like the, that guy with the
875800	877400	glasses channel, awesome style that didn't work
877400	879000	out, did some let's plays that was going like,
879000	881300	okay, but I did some gamer gate videos and that's
881300	882600	when I started doing politics content.
882600	884900	That's when I, that's when I met Sargon, that's
884900	886600	when I met like a bunch of like, you know, arch
886600	888900	Warhammer, that's when I met V, you know, um, a
888900	890100	bunch, a bunch of people that I hang around with
890100	890800	now that I'm still friends with them.
890800	892400	I met them through gamer gate initially.
893700	897600	Um, so the, the one interpretation of events
897800	899300	is that she was sleeping with these five guys
899300	901600	and that led to some sort of incestuous
901600	904900	relationship there where, you know, the, the,
904900	907500	the game journalist scene and the indie game
907500	909500	scene, it was all kind of a big clique, you know,
909500	910900	it's a big club and you're not in it.
911200	912800	And then you had people on the outside who were
913000	914400	generally just regular gamers who were
914400	915000	pissed about it.
915700	919000	And then the other narrative is that it's
919000	921000	a harassment campaign and that it's all about
921000	923000	sexism and that the only reason you're mad about
923000	924740	Zoe Quinn sleeping with these guys is because
924740	926300	you hate women's sexuality.
926300	928200	You hate women, you know, you're, you're
928200	931000	harassing these women and so on and so forth.
931800	932900	And there was definitely some harassment for
932900	934700	sure, like I can't just sit here and say it was
934700	936600	all sunshine and rainbows and everyone had like
936600	938900	the, the, you know, the most, the most moral
938900	939600	reason to be there.
939600	941900	I definitely saw some harassment of a random
941900	944100	woman, but I also saw a lot of good work done
944100	946400	too, in terms of uncovering, um, the
946400	947100	corruption of people.
948400	953500	Um, I spoke at one point to Zoe Quinn's ex, um,
953500	956700	is, is Aaron, is Aaron Joni or Goni or something?
956800	957600	I can't remember his last name.
958500	958600	Yeah.
959100	959300	Yeah.
959600	962200	I spoke to him privately, uh, at one point,
962200	964400	this was back in 2014 and he said, listen, you
964400	965900	know, they're trying to make it, this was like
965900	968000	in the, like the, like the early, the early weeks,
968000	969500	like two weeks in, like one weekend or something
969500	970200	to the controversy.
970200	972000	And he said, listen, they're trying to make
972000	974100	it a sexism issue.
974800	976400	They're probably going to succeed in making it
976400	978300	a story about sexism because they have the
978300	979000	institutional power.
979000	981900	They have the, they have the outlets they have,
981900	984900	you know, when, you know, when, when, when big,
985400	987500	let's say, you know, something like CNN or
987500	989500	Forbes or whoever, like these, these bigger
989500	993000	outlets, when they report on, um, on, on like
993000	995400	a small hobby, like gaming or any other hobby,
995700	997000	they go to the enthusiast press.
997300	999500	So CNN will actually say, what is Kotaku saying?
999500	1001400	Even though Kotaku is a shit rag, they are
1001400	1002800	the main enthusiast press.
1003000	1004800	They will, they will at least see what other
1004800	1007400	journalists are saying in, in that smaller press
1007400	1008500	to, when, when they report on something
1008500	1009200	that makes it big.
1009700	1011900	So Aaron basically said, they're probably
1011900	1014000	going to succeed in making it all about sexism.
1014100	1018000	But what you need to do is ignore, like there
1018000	1019100	are people out there who were talking about,
1019400	1020400	who were talking about how much of a, how
1020400	1021400	much of a slut Zoe is.
1021500	1022900	That's, that's not the issue here.
1022900	1025100	The issue is that you need to look at what
1025100	1026800	these people are actually doing.
1027400	1029040	And my biggest contribution to
1029040	1030100	Gamergate personally.
1030900	1037700	Um, and I, it was the, it sounds weird.
1037700	1038900	It sounds weird to say, it sounds like I'm
1038900	1040000	really blowing myself up here.
1040000	1041640	It wasn't that big of a deal, but it sounds
1041640	1045180	like it was basically an, uh, ending
1045180	1046180	Phil Fish's career.
1047540	1049740	And it had, and that event had nothing to
1049740	1051040	do with sexism whatsoever.
1051340	1053040	There weren't even any women involved in that event.
1053940	1054240	Yeah.
1054340	1056840	Um, basically what happened, what I did,
1056840	1058340	that this, this was my big contribution.
1058340	1059380	Like other people did other things, you
1059380	1060600	know, internet, Mr.
1060600	1061580	Medica, he was digging up stuff.
1061580	1062500	Sargon was digging up stuff.
1062940	1066300	What, um, me and my friends dug up was that
1067140	1070400	early in Gamergate, somebody at Phil Fish's
1070400	1073760	company, Polytron, leaked their financial
1073760	1077140	documents to 4chan, all their internal
1077140	1077900	financial documents.
1077900	1079600	It's probably very illegal to actually
1079600	1080740	have a copy of these because they're
1080740	1081500	considered classified.
1082600	1083860	Um, but I got a copy of them.
1085140	1087300	Um, and there was three of us on the channel
1087300	1088640	at the time, and we kind of sat down and we
1088640	1090400	looked through them and we discovered in the
1090400	1092840	financial documents that a bunch of people who
1092840	1095340	had invested in Polytron.
1096060	1097540	So they had put some people put up like
1097540	1099900	$5,000 and people put up 10,000, 20,000.
1100400	1102260	You know, people put up these chunks of money
1102260	1103800	to own parts of Polytron.
1104300	1108560	These same people, they, um, they were also
1108560	1110860	judges at the Independent Games Festival.
1112900	1116960	And they were judges when the Polytron's
1116960	1121500	only game Fez won awards at, and during
1121500	1124160	two different years, the whole idea of the
1124160	1125940	IGF, the rules are basically, listen, you
1125940	1128200	can, you put forward a game for awards.
1128200	1129840	You can win, you know, game of the year.
1129840	1131640	You can win best sound design, best control,
1131640	1132900	best graphics, whatever, all you have, all
1132900	1133480	the awards, right?
1133780	1135540	But you can only put forward a game once you
1135540	1138700	put, you put it forward when the game launches
1138900	1141700	and Fez launched in 2012, but it won best
1141700	1143100	sound design in 2008.
1143800	1145700	And it won a few other, like a few other awards
1145700	1146600	in 2008 as well.
1146600	1149540	And then at one game of the year in 2012, back
1149540	1151800	in 2012, they said, listen, listen, it's
1151800	1153740	completely fine that it won two sets of awards
1153740	1155700	because we consider Fez's demo to be a different
1155700	1156600	game than Fez itself.
1156840	1158900	That was the only game that the IGF ever did
1158900	1160540	that for no one ever understood why.
1161100	1163100	Um, but then we realized two years later
1163100	1164440	during gamer gate, after we got a hold of the
1164440	1166600	financial documents that the judges, the people
1166600	1168340	at the IGF were the same people who invested
1168340	1169500	in the company that put out Fez.
1170740	1172500	And so they stood to profit from increased
1172500	1173400	valuation of the company.
1173700	1173960	Yeah.
1174400	1176160	So I put this into a video, we edit it
1176160	1177200	together, we put it out.
1177660	1180100	Um, the video goes fucking gangbusters.
1180100	1183300	It got like 500,000 views in like 30
1183300	1183960	minutes or something.
1183960	1185160	Like it was, it was going wild.
1185560	1188160	Um, and then Phil Fish sent me a cease
1188160	1190860	and desist, and he said, you need to
1190860	1192160	fucking take this video down right now.
1192160	1193000	Or else I'm going to sue you.
1193060	1195560	And I was, uh, I was nine years younger,
1195860	1198160	just out of university, had no backbone, no
1198160	1199820	fucking clue if YouTube would work out or not.
1199820	1201700	I had no money, no nothing.
1202020	1202620	So I took it down.
1203460	1205520	Um, I put it back up a few months later and
1205520	1206400	it's still up on my channel.
1206400	1207200	You can go back and watch it.
1207760	1212120	All the evidence is in the video, but, um, the
1212120	1215020	fact that it was up for like an hour and then
1215020	1217000	it went down and then like mirrors of it
1217000	1219240	started popping up and it started going viral
1219240	1221560	on Twitter and everyone was talking about this
1221560	1222900	big revelation of Phil Fish.
1223400	1226460	Um, the next day, and this is still in the
1226460	1227700	archives of their site too.
1227700	1229860	Cause I, I actually made a little, a short
1229860	1231660	video describing what happened with me and
1231660	1234000	Phil Fish, just to, just to kind of update new,
1234000	1235200	my new viewers in the old lore.
1235560	1239540	Um, on the IGFs website, you can see.
1240300	1242140	So they're like, uh, so you might've seen
1242140	1244300	recently some weird, some weird allegations,
1244300	1245940	but we've investigated ourselves and discovered
1245940	1246760	that we did nothing wrong.
1246760	1248920	It was one of those like very boilerplate
1248920	1249560	statements, right?
1250160	1252260	So no one fucking trusted these guys anymore.
1252420	1254020	Since then, no one's really cared about what
1254020	1255760	the IGF has, has, has done.
1255760	1257960	They've been like in a slow decline and Phil
1257960	1260660	Fish hasn't released a game since, since
1260660	1263320	gamer gate, he, he, he just left the internet.
1263320	1265160	He left the internet, he left indie gaming.
1265160	1265720	He left all of it.
1266160	1269920	And you know, now I'm 135,000 subs, which
1269920	1271800	isn't, which isn't small, but it's not big,
1271860	1273660	but it's big enough that some people know who I
1273660	1276460	am and I've basically heard from people who
1276920	1278960	who, you know, are games journalists who
1278960	1281060	watch me, who are game developers who watch
1281060	1282720	me, you know, the, the, there, there are
1282720	1283820	people who have like messaged me and said,
1283820	1284960	listen, you can't reveal who I am.
1284960	1285660	I'll lose my job.
1285860	1288520	But just so you know, no one wants to work
1288520	1289420	with Phil Fish anymore.
1289620	1290520	And that's why he's gone.
1290520	1291520	Wow.
1292120	1293620	And I've heard that from like about five
1293620	1296660	different people now that he's, he's just, he,
1296920	1298560	I, I basically nuked his career.
1299960	1300960	Holy shit.
1301120	1302220	How does that feel?
1302660	1304960	It feels, it feels pretty good.
1305660	1307520	I mean, like, like no one likes the whole
1307520	1309660	cancel culture thing, but like, this was
1309660	1310320	actual corruption.
1310360	1312560	This was not like, Oh, you, you have a mean
1312560	1314760	tweet where you said the N word 10 years ago.
1314760	1315620	So we're going to get, we're going to get you
1315620	1316860	fired from your wagey job.
1316860	1318200	But that wasn't that, this is something
1318200	1320000	different, you know, this is somebody who
1320000	1321260	actually behaved inappropriately.
1321420	1325160	And the thing is, none of this story has
1325160	1328220	anything to do with sexism or harassment
1328220	1328820	whatsoever.
1330860	1333920	So, so they're, they're definitely, you
1333920	1336820	know, if there is a side to gamer gate that
1336820	1338420	wasn't about that, at the very least, it was
1338420	1340280	me, I can personally confirm that I wasn't
1340280	1340880	part of that stuff.
1341580	1341820	Yeah.
1342080	1345280	Um, I don't think Sargon was either from all
1345280	1346620	that I, from all that I know of him, he doesn't
1346620	1347180	seem like the type.
1348220	1353720	Um, however, like in just, just to prepare
1353720	1355460	for this, I went back and watched a bit of
1355460	1356020	my old videos.
1356020	1357760	Oh God, they're so hard to watch, man.
1357760	1359980	Like the shittiest mic, the shittiest audio
1359980	1361060	quality was 2014.
1361060	1363380	I had no fucking clue, you know, but, um,
1363380	1364780	I went back and watched some of them and
1364780	1366940	even like in my second gamer gate video, I
1366940	1369180	was like, listen, I have seen some harassment.
1369180	1370280	You guys got to cut the shit out.
1370280	1370580	All right.
1370580	1372840	Where we're trying to discover that these
1372840	1374280	people are actually really fucking corrupt.
1374280	1374940	You got to cut this out.
1374940	1377980	So even back then I was, I was a bit of a don't
1377980	1379680	harass people kind of cuck.
1379880	1380480	You know what I mean?
1381280	1381580	Yeah.
1384340	1384980	Interesting.
1385540	1386140	That's what I did.
1386940	1389440	That's what I did personally, but in terms
1389440	1392740	of gamer gate as a whole, um, man, there's
1392840	1393840	so much like old lore.
1393840	1395340	I was, I was talking to Chud Logic about
1395340	1397440	this in private a few days ago.
1398200	1400240	You wanted to try and arrange a conversation
1400240	1402900	between me and Brianna Wu because she was very
1402900	1404840	like anti gamer gate, like one of the most
1404840	1406240	vocal anti gamer gate people.
1406400	1409200	And I'm like, you can do that Chud, but I
1409200	1412380	have old evidence from back in the day that
1412380	1414200	Brianna Wu faked her own harassment.
1414840	1416000	I've been sitting on it for nine
1416000	1417040	fucking years, Chud.
1417400	1418800	We can, we can do this if you want, but
1418800	1420140	it's not going to end well for her.
1420740	1421200	Wow.
1421940	1422240	Yeah.
1423740	1424500	Let's see if I can dig it up for you.
1424500	1425300	If you want to see it, hold on.
1425740	1427900	Let me go into the, the Chud DMS real quick.
1429100	1430440	And so I don't know if that conversation
1430440	1431740	is going to happen or not.
1431800	1432540	Yeah.
1433040	1434100	Holy moly.
1435140	1436100	Let's see here.
1436140	1437040	I'm going to scroll up.
1437140	1438540	Chud and I talk a fair amount, so it's
1438540	1440700	kind of deep in the DMS now.
1441300	1441700	Yeah.
1445400	1448140	Um, and it seems like, uh, you know, the,
1448140	1452300	the reputation of these, uh, game gaming,
1452300	1455100	like journalists, journalism, you know,
1455100	1457800	sites and platforms or whatever, um,
1457840	1459440	haven't really improved.
1459460	1461660	Like for the most part, everybody still
1461660	1465000	thinks that Kotaku is, you know, shit.
1465400	1468100	Everybody still thinks that, um, it just
1468100	1470400	seems like, it seems like for the most
1470400	1473300	part, people still don't trust, uh, these
1473300	1474260	like reporters.
1475340	1475560	Yeah.
1475560	1476600	Well, the issue is they never like
1476600	1477640	came out and apologized.
1478040	1480140	I remember Medeker saying like a week or
1480380	1482540	two in that if they just said, listen, yeah,
1482540	1483540	we fucked up, we're sorry.
1483540	1484440	We won't do it again.
1485040	1486540	I think everyone had forgiven them, but
1486540	1487140	they still haven't.
1487480	1488640	They said, it's about sexism.
1488680	1489740	It's only about sexism.
1490000	1491740	If you imply that it's about anything other
1491740	1493100	than sexism, you're a sexist.
1494300	1496740	So like, because that was, there was, there
1496740	1500940	was just this, this, this hegemonic, um, you
1500940	1503640	know, circling of the wagons where it's like,
1503680	1504680	this was the narrative.
1504840	1507180	If you disagreed, you were a sexist.
1507240	1508880	And then two years later it became racist.
1508880	1510080	And two years later it became fascist.
1510220	1511980	This is kind of where that, that whole
1512280	1514420	radicalization of the Overton window started
1514420	1516080	was, I think, I think that's what started
1516080	1517080	it was what was a gamer gate.
1517420	1518580	I don't think that like gamer gate
1518580	1519780	caused Trump or Brexit.
1520080	1522880	I think that gamer gate started a slow
1522880	1525220	media radicalization that contributed to
1525220	1526540	those two events later.
1526840	1528740	And is now why we're, we're living in like
1528740	1530880	a media hellscape where people are getting
1530880	1532980	canceled over 10 year old tweets and fucking
1532980	1534620	like everything is the most possible woke.
1534620	1535580	And it's just ridiculous.
1535980	1537720	You know, it makes sense that also that's
1537720	1539860	the start of when people stop trusting,
1540220	1542120	um, like media, right.
1542120	1543460	They stopped trusting media.
1543460	1545480	They stopped trusting mainstream media.
1545780	1548580	Um, and for a good reason, and we can
1548580	1551160	still see people are very skeptical of
1551160	1552580	mainstream media today.
1553060	1555780	Um, so I think it very much is related.
1555780	1556180	Yeah.
1558220	1558420	Okay.
1558420	1561080	Regarding, we're going to woo, check out,
1561080	1561580	check this out.
1561960	1562860	You can, this is not something
1562860	1563460	that's been doctored.
1563460	1564660	You can find this all over the internet.
1564660	1565820	This is old deep lore.
1566060	1566960	I just DMed it to you.
1567420	1568900	So pull that up and let me know
1568900	1570060	what it looks like to you.
1570820	1571760	It looks like a tweet.
1572300	1572500	Yeah.
1572500	1575700	Uh, and, uh, chat can't see this.
1576160	1576660	Um,
1576760	1577700	Oh, I can't see it.
1578360	1579600	Uh, should I show it to chat?
1579620	1580060	Do you want me to show it?
1580060	1580220	Yeah, sure.
1580220	1580620	Yeah, go ahead.
1580700	1581200	Yeah, go ahead.
1581500	1581800	All right.
1581860	1583720	One, let me share it.
1588860	1589320	Okay.
1589360	1590620	It says, and here's the part of the
1590620	1592260	night where I call the police.
1592800	1594800	Um, and it's like a quote, tweet of
1595360	1596420	death to Brianna.
1596460	1598080	I've got a K bar and I'm coming to your
1598080	1600020	house so I can shove it up your ugly
1600060	1600980	feminist con.
1601720	1601920	Yeah.
1603320	1607880	Look at the, um, when that
1607880	1608920	other tweet was posted.
1610960	1612880	So this was 19 seconds.
1613320	1614380	19 seconds earlier.
1614980	1615360	Yeah.
1615420	1618420	So what is, what are the chances that
1618420	1620980	Brianna Wu saw this in 19 seconds
1620980	1621780	and then tweeted about it?
1623820	1625160	Um, I don't know.
1625960	1628600	What, what are the, what are the odds?
1629360	1631700	It seems a bit more likely that maybe
1631700	1632820	this might be her sock account.
1634060	1636620	Because to find a tweet in seconds
1636620	1638360	was unheard of back in 2014.
1638560	1640200	It took several minutes to push those up.
1641000	1641200	Yeah.
1641200	1643000	And she must've been getting a lot of,
1643060	1644660	um, she may, it must've been getting a
1644660	1646820	lot of notifications as well back then.
1646820	1647300	Yeah.
1647560	1647800	Yeah.
1648500	1648660	Yeah.
1649400	1652620	Uh, but even that, that is, um, let's
1652620	1655120	see, that's a bit less con that's a bit
1655120	1656920	less ironclad because, you know, maybe
1656920	1658060	she did actually see it in 19 seconds.
1658060	1658320	Who knows?
1658320	1658460	Right.
1658460	1658820	Who knows?
1659060	1661060	But notice in that tweet, her that's
1661060	1662260	her old name, space cat gal.
1662260	1663760	That was like the name of her game company
1663760	1665520	back before she, when she was making games.
1665920	1667060	Um, okay.
1667420	1669960	This is also old lore, not doctored.
1670020	1671060	Many people can confirm this.
1672560	1675680	This one is a picture of the discussions
1675680	1682660	page on her game on steam where she
1682660	1686000	accidentally posts harassment to herself
1686500	1689160	under her own name, forgetting to log
1689160	1692200	out and log into her, her, her sock account.
1694700	1697160	If PSX had a development and noted feminist
1697160	1700660	Brianna Wu, a terrible person, um, 8chan
1700660	1702360	gamer gate and Kotaku in action,
1702360	1703560	knock yourselves out.
1704460	1705400	And okay.
1705400	1706920	So she's the poster.
1707160	1707400	Yeah.
1710060	1710600	Yeah.
1710660	1711140	Oof.
1711160	1712760	That's like very cringe.
1712800	1714300	That's a cringe moment for sure.
1714300	1715960	What did she have to say about it?
1716500	1717760	She has never once talked
1717760	1718640	about this in public.
1719960	1721400	She has always ignored it when it comes up.
1723360	1723940	Wow.
1725300	1726660	I don't think, I don't think anyone's like
1726660	1728540	talked to her about it in a panel or anything,
1729040	1730040	uh, or in an interview.
1730500	1732300	And whenever someone like, like messages
1732300	1733700	her on Twitter, she just ignores it.
1733700	1734660	She just doesn't reply.
1734840	1735500	This is something that she
1735500	1736660	has just tried to bury.
1737400	1737840	Yeah.
1738900	1739340	Wow.
1739500	1739960	Okay.
1740460	1743660	It reminds me of, uh, oh, who was it?
1744260	1745720	Was it Stefan Molyneux who did it where
1745720	1747560	he like, he's like, he, he, he replies to
1747560	1749220	his own video and somewhere where he's
1749220	1751220	like, I'm actually like a black woman.
1751220	1753220	And I remember that fuck.
1753220	1753960	That was ridiculous.
1754420	1754820	Yeah.
1754860	1755520	Oh, that's what it was.
1755520	1756420	Oh fuck.
1756660	1758260	It reminds it's, it's exactly like that.
1758260	1761220	And it's like, man, guys, guys, how, how
1761220	1763620	is it that you're like, if you're so
1763620	1767200	desperate, like how could the narrative
1767200	1768300	is that these people are being harassed
1768300	1769600	so much, why do you have to fake it?
1769600	1770600	If you're being harassed that much?
1771600	1772040	Yeah.
1772100	1774360	Um, somebody in chat says, start, could
1774360	1775760	it not just be that she was trying
1775760	1777660	to get feedback on herself?
1778160	1779860	I mean, yeah, if we wanted to be like
1779860	1781500	super, if we wanted to be the most
1781500	1785360	charitable possible, maybe, but then why
1785360	1787000	wouldn't she just say that, I guess, why
1787000	1788600	wouldn't she just address it and say that
1788600	1789060	much?
1789860	1790160	Yeah.
1791500	1793140	If you really want to steal a minute, it
1793140	1797660	does maybe read like she's being, she's
1797660	1799920	like self-flagellating here, but I don't
1799920	1800320	think so.
1800500	1801060	I don't think so.
1801120	1801400	Yeah.
1802320	1802600	Yeah.
1803120	1803320	Yeah.
1803600	1804600	And the fact that she wouldn't talk
1804600	1805100	about it later.
1805100	1805400	Yeah.
1805720	1805920	Yeah.
1805960	1806260	Yeah.
1806920	1809100	I mean, yeah, it's easy to just be like,
1809100	1811000	yeah, I was looking for feedback on myself
1811000	1813660	or I was feeling, you know, um, a certain
1813660	1815220	type of way or something like that.
1815260	1815520	Wow.
1815560	1815720	Yep.
1815760	1817220	I was in an, in a depressive spiral or
1817220	1819460	something, but nope, she just ignores it.
1819700	1821020	And she has for nine years now.
1821020	1822660	So, yeah.
1824100	1826020	Um, so yeah, that's, that's the
1826020	1827120	Brianna Wu stuff.
1827180	1829220	Uh, there's something else I wanted to
1829220	1830980	bring up what we're talking about right
1830980	1831580	before Brianna Wu.
1831580	1832080	Do you remember?
1833380	1835880	Uh, we were talking about how you ended,
1835880	1840320	um, uh, yeah, Phil Fish's career.
1840320	1840620	Yeah.
1840860	1842580	I mean, I like, I put up like, like a
1842580	1844980	TikTok it's like two minutes long that
1844980	1846180	kind of describes the whole thing, but
1846180	1847280	you mean you already heard me describe it.
1847280	1848480	It just shows a few screenshots of what
1848480	1848820	happened.
1848960	1849580	It's not a big deal.
1850120	1852520	Um, shit.
1854820	1855980	Oh, yes.
1856540	1858620	Do you remember the, the gamers are
1858620	1859480	dead part of it?
1860780	1861340	I don't.
1861880	1862040	Okay.
1862040	1863180	Let me just here.
1863740	1865040	I'm going to the know your meme page
1865040	1865180	here.
1865180	1866420	I'll link this to you just so you could
1866420	1868580	read it later if you like, because the
1868580	1870020	know your meme page and the Wikipedia
1870020	1871140	page are good for the book are good for
1871140	1871740	the two sides.
1872540	1875320	Um, let's see.
1878520	1880980	Let me just control effort.
1882920	1883140	Oops.
1884980	1885480	Oh, it's out here.
1886240	1886720	It doesn't matter.
1886720	1887680	This is one of those, another one of
1887680	1888920	those images you can just find just by
1888920	1889980	searching gamers are dead.
1890720	1894880	It's yep.
1894920	1895380	Here it is.
1896480	1896980	Oh, come on.
1896980	1900740	Why is it like 300 pixels wide guys?
1903240	1904080	Give me the original.
1906240	1906580	Hold on.
1906980	1907640	Hold on just a second.
1910420	1910820	Okay.
1911120	1911380	Yeah.
1912080	1914120	So this happened about one week after
1914120	1915340	the Zoe post dropped.
1915480	1915880	Okay.
1916980	1918540	Uh, here, I'm going to post, I'm going
1918540	1919280	to give you this image here.
1920380	1921740	So this ha this happened about one
1921740	1923840	week after the Zoe post dropped and there
1923840	1926180	was this huge, you know, consumer backlash.
1927980	1932440	All of these gaming sites put forward
1932440	1934940	articles saying gamers are dead.
1935020	1935680	Gamers are over.
1935740	1937940	It's the end of the gamer gaming is
1937940	1939940	leaving gamers behind the identity of
1939940	1942440	gamer is, is done is gone.
1942480	1942940	That's it.
1943940	1944280	All right.
1945020	1945320	All right.
1946180	1947280	And they all came out like within
1947280	1948020	an hour of each other.
1948740	1949140	Yeah.
1949520	1952880	And so, so total biscuit, who I think
1952920	1953980	he was, he was still alive at the time.
1953980	1955420	He didn't die till I think 2017, right?
1955780	1956440	Total biscuit.
1956520	1958680	He said, he, he, he famously said on
1958680	1961340	Twitter, I've never seen anything like this.
1962320	1964820	I've never seen anything like this level of
1965140	1966920	coordination or collaboration.
1967280	1969320	And all of these articles talked about
1969680	1972220	how Anita Sarkeesian was, um, was getting
1972220	1973820	harassment due to this, how Brianna
1973860	1975660	Wu was getting harassment to this, due
1975660	1979180	to this, how the path forward for, for
1979180	1981960	progress in the games industry was for
1982520	1984920	journalists and independent game developers
1985060	1987260	to no longer consider gamers to be their
1987260	1990220	audience and to say, yeah, you have a group
1990220	1992480	of people who are, you know, they're pretty
1992480	1994120	socially, not, not that well adjusted.
1994380	1995620	They're kind of maligned, they're kind of
1995620	1998060	nerdy and you know, and then, and the only
1998060	1999780	thing they really have as in terms of a
1999780	2002380	collective identity is gamer as you know,
2002480	2004940	as in celly as that sounds, when you have
2004940	2007840	the enthusiast press attacking them like
2007840	2009240	this, it doesn't go over well.
2009880	2010980	That's got a lot of people angry.
2011580	2013640	People were very, very angry when this
2013640	2013940	happened.
2017580	2019820	Um, yeah, that, yeah, it looks sus.
2019820	2021820	It just looks so, so, I mean, not even
2021820	2024220	sus, it just looks like, you know,
2024380	2026880	conclusive that all of these people are
2027620	2029680	coordinated, um, essentially.
2029920	2031720	So there, there's no doubt about it.
2032080	2032360	Yeah.
2033120	2033420	Yeah.
2033820	2035760	And then it came out, uh, three or
2035760	2039360	four months later, there was, uh, a game
2039360	2042880	journalist named Billy D who ran a website
2042880	2043960	called one angry gamer.
2044520	2046960	He was part of a Google group called game
2046960	2049520	journal pros, where it turned out that they
2049520	2052060	were all in there discussing what articles
2052060	2054780	to publish, what political opinions were
2054780	2057260	safe to put forward, what you were, what you
2057260	2058780	should publish on your website, what you
2058780	2059920	shouldn't publish on your website.
2060420	2061520	And they were all colluding it.
2062120	2064620	Um, Billy D gave the information to Milo.
2065320	2067660	Milo published it on Breitbart and that
2067660	2070520	was Milo's big, uh, his, his first big
2070520	2073160	breakaway he took off because of publishing
2073480	2074260	Billy D's leak.
2075160	2078220	So Milo was even involved in gamer gate.
2078480	2078880	Yes.
2079220	2081860	Milo was, no one had heard of, had heard
2081860	2082820	of Milo before gamer gate.
2084120	2085580	Milo was where he blew up, sorry.
2085580	2086660	Gamer gate was where Milo blew up.
2087620	2088020	Okay.
2089020	2089380	Wow.
2090380	2092380	Um, there you go.
2092440	2093580	I'm going to try to find the game
2093580	2094380	journal pros.
2098040	2099540	Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.
2102440	2104540	I mean, Oh, there's like a bunch of articles
2104540	2106820	describing it and like who was on it.
2107440	2109340	If you search for the, the name game
2109340	2110440	journal pros, you'll find it.
2110480	2112380	But like there's a bunch of articles
2112380	2113680	of describing what happened.
2115120	2116680	Yeah, I can, I can post you an article, I
2116680	2118920	guess, but like a lot of this is just, you
2118920	2120660	know, reading, you know, reading old lore.
2121520	2122020	Yeah.
2123520	2126560	But yeah, uh, what was being said and how
2126560	2129020	things were, were being colluded in game
2129020	2130060	journal pros was leaked.
2130120	2132120	Milo was the one who leaked it that
2132120	2133760	basically made Milo's career.
2133880	2134820	That's how we got started.
2135360	2138060	And then he, he moved on to, to, he, he moved
2138060	2140020	on to bigger things in 2015 with Brexit and
2140020	2142860	2016 with Trump, but he got started doing
2142860	2143520	gamer gate stuff.
2144620	2144960	Wow.
2145760	2147200	Someone in your chat says as much as
2147200	2148860	gamer gate went off the rails, this
2148860	2150060	aspect is indisputable.
2150500	2152760	They instigated a reaction and then cited
2152760	2154600	the reaction to justify the instigation.
2155100	2157260	Yeah, that sounds, that sounds pretty
2157260	2158400	similar to what happened.
2158900	2162000	That like a lot of, a lot of the gamers,
2162060	2164100	like just blew up and a lot of them went
2164100	2166760	overboard during gamer gate, but they, but
2166760	2168100	they went overboard because of the, of
2168100	2170000	the terrible, the consistent, terrible
2170000	2171200	behavior of all of these people.
2171600	2173200	And then after that, they went overboard
2173200	2175300	that's what they use to justify their
2175300	2175700	behavior.
2176100	2177400	They said, Oh, well, we, we don't need
2177400	2178860	to, you know, gamers don't actually need
2178860	2179860	to be our audience anymore because look
2179860	2180860	at how they blow up when we insult them.
2180940	2182500	And it's like, well, okay.
2183160	2183400	Yeah.
2186400	2186700	Yeah.
2186700	2187060	Oh yeah.
2187060	2188860	I'm seeing it here now in the timeline.
2191200	2194300	So yeah, the timeline in this time, I'll
2194300	2198100	link the timeline, but, and you can tell
2198100	2199600	me how accurate this timeline is.
2199600	2201700	I think it's, it's, it's, it's, it's
2201700	2203400	funny how accurate this timeline is.
2204300	2206500	You know, but this is where it was.
2207800	2211160	Oh, rational Wiki, but they're also
2211160	2212100	slanted, but that's fine.
2212160	2213100	Everyone has their slanted.
2213900	2214200	Oh yeah.
2214760	2214960	Yeah.
2215000	2216100	They're, they're like hyper feminist
2216100	2216460	actually.
2217100	2217860	Oh, for real.
2218060	2218360	Yeah.
2219300	2221060	I just, I was looking at it because it's
2221060	2223140	like the most comprehensive timeline I
2223140	2225300	could find, but if there's a better one
2225300	2226340	around, you know, I'm
2226800	2228460	know your meme, know your memes page is
2228460	2230300	pretty good on it too, but it's from a
2230300	2231500	completely different political point of
2231500	2231660	view.
2232000	2232200	Yeah.
2232400	2232800	Okay.
2233800	2234400	Let's see here.
2234460	2236300	I'm just going to quickly skim it.
2239400	2240360	So yeah, I see this.
2240400	2241000	Um,
2250200	2252100	mundane Matt publishes the Zoe post
2252400	2253600	not August 16th.
2253700	2254000	Yep.
2262700	2264300	Yeah, there's, there's deep lore of
2264300	2267400	like, of all these people involved, man.
2267500	2270300	Like, so there's somebody that Zoe Quinn
2270300	2272200	drove to suicide completely unrelated
2272200	2273800	to gamer gate, you know, like all of
2273800	2275100	these people have a history that would
2275200	2276800	that, that can serve as its own video
2277200	2278200	independent from what they've done with
2278200	2278600	gamer gate.
2280100	2282500	Um, yeah, somebody in chat was mentioning
2282500	2285800	that, um, Alec Holoka.
2286200	2286500	Yeah.
2286700	2288100	Did he make night in the woods?
2289300	2289500	Huh?
2292700	2292900	Yeah.
2292900	2295000	Alec Holowalk, a Canadian game developer.
2295100	2295500	Yeah.
2295500	2296100	Killed himself.
2296800	2297200	Yep.
2298600	2300300	He killed himself October, 2019.
2302700	2304400	And how did that happen?
2304700	2308100	Like, why do people say that she contributed
2308100	2308600	to that?
2310400	2313100	Uh, basically Zoe made false rape
2313100	2316200	allegations against him and destroyed his
2316200	2318900	career and he was already like prone to
2318900	2319900	depressive bouts.
2320300	2322100	I haven't looked at that story, um, in a
2322100	2323300	long time, I have to go back and actually
2323300	2323800	look at that one.
2323800	2325000	Cause it wasn't related to gamer gate.
2325000	2326100	It was like its own thing.
2327800	2329700	There was a lot of like weird, deep lore.
2329800	2332500	You know, like if the precursor to Kiwi
2332500	2334300	farms that existed back then, cause it was
2334300	2336800	before Kiwi farms, I think, you know, like
2336800	2338500	they were digging around like Zoe Quinn's
2338500	2340100	family and they found her original name
2340100	2341500	because that's not her original name.
2341800	2343500	They discovered that like, you know, her,
2343500	2346000	her father comes from like old European
2346000	2348500	money and like her boyfriend was like
2348500	2350300	this guy who was the son of like an arms
2350300	2351900	dealer, there was a bunch of weird shit
2351900	2352600	that people found.
2352900	2354100	And it was all really interesting and kind
2354100	2355600	of fun and exciting to be like, Oh my God,
2355600	2357300	we're discovering the secrets of like, of
2357300	2360100	these people who, of these hipsters, who,
2360100	2361900	they're almost like, like the late, like
2361900	2363500	discovering like, like secrets of like, of
2363500	2364900	like the upper class, you know what I mean?
2364900	2366000	Like these people who have a lot of money,
2366000	2367100	they're traveling around, they're going to
2367100	2368500	different countries or going to all these events.
2368900	2370700	It was, there was like, there's a big, there's
2370700	2373000	an excitement part to it where you're like
2373100	2374900	uncovering these, these weird secrets.
2374900	2376700	Like, why is it that this, this, this
2376700	2378800	hyper-socialist guy, Oh, he, he, he comes
2378800	2381000	from old money and his dad selling weapons
2381000	2382100	to Israel, like, Holy shit.
2382400	2383800	You know, stories like that kept coming
2383800	2386100	up about everyone, but in, but that was all
2386100	2390100	like fun side stuff that contributed to the
2390100	2391400	character of these people.
2391700	2394400	But the actual gamer gate conversation
2394400	2399700	itself was the, the, um, the game journalists
2400100	2402000	and the independent developers who collaborate,
2402900	2404600	who, uh, who agree to set narratives.
2404600	2406500	Where, where money's changing hands sometimes.
2407000	2409100	And then on the flip side, it was the
2409100	2410900	harassment that these people received.
2411300	2413100	Some of it legitimate, some of it illegitimate.
2414300	2415100	Some of it deserved.
2415100	2416200	I mean, not, not legitimate, you know what,
2416200	2416700	you know what I mean?
2416700	2418600	Like, like, um, deserve because they had
2418600	2420100	behaved poorly, some of it not deserved
2420100	2421200	because they were just, the people
2421200	2421900	were just going crazy.
2423300	2423700	Yeah.
2424600	2426500	Um, so let me go back to the time.
2426500	2427900	I want to see, yeah.
2427900	2432000	How did Brianna Wu like contribute to stuff?
2432000	2434500	Cause I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
2434700	2438100	when I looked at thisconomical OCA, it
2438100	2440500	says he was accused of physical and emotional
2440500	2441900	abuse by Zoe Quinn.
2442700	2446600	Um, did you mention Brianna women relation to that,
2448100	2449300	no, no, she's not related.
2449300	2452900	To the alcohol oil crate store or Anita
2452900	2456900	Sarkeesian and Briana Wu, both inserted
2456900	2458400	themselves into gamer gate.
2459000	2460700	The Zoe post, didn't mention them.
2461200	2462480	There's only post mentioned so we
2462480	2468480	Quinn and the five guys that basically it, um, Anita Sarkeesian was already
2468480	2471120	like, she was already kind of hated for the feminist frequency series.
2471120	2474000	That was going since 2010 or something or 2011.
2475080	2479840	Um, and it's my personal opinion that Anita Sarkeesian and Brianna
2479840	2483760	Wu both inserted themselves into gamer gate and said, Hey, we're women too.
2483920	2487500	We're also facing harassment to guys because it was a way to bolster their
2487500	2490800	career, it was the same thing that Milo did, they all found opportunities
2490800	2493880	to make their, to the kind of, you know, bump up their profile, make a
2493880	2495800	name for themselves, grow their brand.
2496160	2501640	They saw, you know, a, this rather organic, um, uh, cultural event
2501640	2504640	happening on the internet and everyone jumped in out to try it, to try
2504640	2505880	and basically pump themselves up.
2507920	2510440	And that's the only reason that Brianna Wu was involved in it.
2510440	2510800	She did.
2510800	2513960	She, she wasn't involved in any of the actual events.
2516600	2517000	Okay.
2517960	2523040	I'm trying to look for, um, the timeline that you're, you said
2523040	2525040	there's a timeline on know your meme.
2525840	2526520	Yeah, I'll post it.
2527120	2528680	Yeah, here it is.
2532240	2534680	What do you think is the most like unbiased one?
2535000	2537360	Um, good luck.
2537640	2541040	10 years on everyone's kind of like set in their ways regarding
2541040	2542320	a narrative, you know, good luck.
2542360	2545480	If you like, if you search gamer gate right now, here, here, I'm going to go.
2545800	2546680	I'm just going to see if this is true.
2546680	2546840	Okay.
2546840	2547600	I'm going to go over to Twitter.
2547840	2548600	I'm going to search gamer game.
2549000	2549200	All right.
2549720	2552760	What do you, what are the latest tweets that say the word gamer game, aside from
2552760	2554240	yours and mine, because we just tweeted about it, right?
2554440	2554680	Yeah.
2555680	2560560	Um, I don't know people accusing people of being fascist or something.
2560840	2561400	Yeah.
2561960	2562360	Yeah.
2562680	2564760	Like, man, what was it?
2565640	2570880	Hassan recently said that because the developer of the atomic heart video
2570880	2577840	game didn't have any like left-leaning woke people, social justice people on the
2577840	2580560	development team, and it was all like, like a bunch of kind of nerdy guys.
2581040	2583560	Hassan said this was, this was a gamer gate developer.
2584400	2585520	And I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?
2585520	2586800	Is that what gamer gate is now?
2587520	2588600	Yeah, it's not going to find that one.
2590560	2592200	Dude Hassan Hassan's hilarious.
2592200	2595440	He's like the, the gift that keeps on giving when it comes to terrible takes.
2595520	2598240	Yeah, certainly is.
2598280	2598640	Yeah.
2598800	2603040	I can't believe like the amount of terrible takes that one person can have.
2606120	2606960	Let's see here.
2607160	2608280	What do you think about this?
2608320	2614440	So when I was looking through the rational Wiki, um, it said that somewhere in it, it
2614440	2625760	says that, um, the Zoe Quinn post was debunked by, was it, let's see.
2625760	2630800	Um, debunked by Yoni himself.
2631920	2638280	Um, let's see, I'm doing the control F for debunked and see what we get.
2642000	2642920	Uh, let's see.
2645720	2650120	According to IRC logs, the Zoe post was later edited by Aaron.
2650720	2653640	The original accusations were later debunked by himself.
2653640	2655080	Let's see what this debunking is.
2656760	2661760	Zoe Quinn, Aaron clarifies the Zoe Quinn, Nathan Grayson timeline.
2661760	2662640	Let's see what the debunking is.
2662640	2663280	I'm going to read this.
2686760	2686960	Okay.
2686960	2687560	I know what this is.
2687560	2688160	I know what this is.
2688800	2689000	Okay.
2690000	2695480	Um, I think it was, it was either mundane, Matt or internet aristocrat.
2695800	2699800	It was one of the two and I think it might be mundane, Matt, um, that made the claim
2700680	2707000	that Zoe Quinn got favorable coverage of her game depression quest because of the
2707000	2711880	fact that she was sleeping with Nathan, Nathan Grayson and Nathan Grayson, Grayson
2711880	2716920	Nathan Grayson Grayson never, um, never reviewed the game depression quest.
2717240	2718240	So that's true.
2718880	2723800	Um, that was something that was floating around that I remember seeing repeated a
2723800	2725960	lot during gamer gate, but it wasn't true.
2726120	2727400	That part was actually false.
2727960	2735000	Um, what was true was not the, the, uh, the, the review of depression
2735000	2735880	quest that never existed.
2736280	2738680	What was actually true was the coverage of the game jam.
2739560	2741400	The game jam coverage was the actual thing.
2741880	2746680	That, that Nathan Grayson reported on after he had slept with Zoe Quinn and Zoe
2746680	2748200	Quinn was one of the principles in the story.
2748480	2753640	And he had every reason to, to basically make the story look good for Zoe because
2753880	2756000	Zoe faced potential legal action.
2756000	2760440	If it, if it looked like she had intentionally tanked the game jam because
2760440	2762800	she had her own game jam coming up soon, which she did.
2764280	2764600	Yeah.
2765040	2765520	Okay.
2765800	2767000	Do you know what a game jam is?
2767760	2769240	I don't know what a game jam is now.
2769680	2769880	Okay.
2769960	2773480	A game jam is a tournament where you get together a bunch of people and you
2773480	2776720	sit them down in a room for like 24 hours or 48 hours or whatever.
2776880	2777720	And you say, make a game.
2778400	2780080	Make, make, make, just make, make a game really quick.
2780240	2780560	All right.
2780760	2782480	And it's like televised and it's like,
2783480	2784680	yeah, I do know what this is.
2784680	2785000	Okay.
2785040	2785400	Yeah.
2785720	2790320	So Zoe Quinn was invited to one and she had her own competing one lined up.
2791280	2791600	Yeah.
2792000	2796560	And there's reports that she intentionally tanked the one she was
2796560	2798720	inviting on to get more eyes on hers.
2799400	2802720	And the only person who reported on the event was the guy she was fucking.
2803080	2804040	That's where the collusion is.
2804040	2807160	It has nothing to do with, with, with, with reviewing Zoe's games.
2808400	2812640	So how did, um, how, how did she intentionally tank the
2812640	2814760	game jam, the competing one?
2815280	2816120	I'd have to go back and see.
2816440	2817360	That's, that's some deep lore.
2817360	2820240	I don't, I don't remember exactly what it was, but I remember, I remember
2820240	2824800	that she somehow intentionally tanked it and I had a chance to, hold on.
2826480	2826920	Oh, fuck it.
2827280	2828480	I had a, fuck it.
2828600	2832400	I had a chance to, um, ask John Tron at one point who was part of the game jam.
2832760	2834360	Like, did she actually intentionally tank it?
2834360	2834960	And he was like, yeah.
2836120	2838040	And he, he confirmed it to me personally.
2838880	2842560	So I tend to believe it, but in terms of how she tanked the game jam,
2842560	2843600	I have to go look that up.
2843840	2846880	It was the centerpiece of one of internet aristocrats old videos,
2847160	2848400	but I can't remember the details.
2848760	2849040	Okay.
2853080	2853520	Me too.
2853600	2858080	There's just so much, there's so much deep lore in this that like, I
2858320	2865520	I feel like, you know, I'm doing this interview with Brianna, um, uh, in a few
2865520	2872720	days, show her the proof stardust, burn the bridge, um, we'll see.
2872760	2876880	Um, I'm going to try and approach it as unbiased as possible.
2876920	2877280	Right.
2877360	2881200	Um, but, um, obviously there are things here that I can ask her about.
2881240	2881720	Definitely.
2881720	2882800	I'm going to ask her about them.
2883280	2892280	Um, so, uh, yeah, uh, there's just so much stuff that, that is going on
2892280	2897520	in this, in this timeline that like, I feel like I could study this for
2897520	2900920	like a year and still not understand the entirety of the thing.
2901440	2902760	Um, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
2903160	2905160	Um, Jim's old videos were pretty good.
2905440	2907080	Sargon's old videos are pretty good.
2907720	2910840	Um, my old videos are pretty good, but the quality on them fucking sucks.
2910840	2913240	Um, okay, here we go.
2913240	2915080	I think, I think, I think I found it.
2917560	2918040	Oh God.
2918040	2918480	Yeah, that's right.
2918480	2919720	Phil fish's Twitter rant.
2920200	2921160	I'm so glad he's gone.
2924280	2925240	Let me just give me a second here.
2931760	2932240	Let's see.
2933320	2933480	Okay.
2940840	2945960	Oh, that's right.
2945960	2947880	The fine young capitalists.
2950720	2953800	Do you remember, did you hear what them, that was part of the story.
2954320	2956040	I know that it's in the timeline.
2956040	2959240	The fine, fine young capitalists are in the timeline.
2959680	2964160	Here's here's they were, they were the ones that I think that
2964160	2965600	they, they tanked the game jam of.
2967200	2970080	This was, this was their story that they posted on, on Reddit.
2970840	2974560	I'm going to pull that one up now.
2979440	2980640	Oh, I see it here.
2980640	2982080	And, okay.
2983120	2983360	Right.
2983440	2983960	Um,
2989160	2991320	Oh yeah, someone in your chat just said that the fine young
2991320	2992560	capitalists are completely gone.
2992560	2992800	Oh yeah.
2992800	2994360	They've been gone for like five or six years now.
2994640	2997840	They just, they just left because fuck.
2998520	2999000	Yeah.
2999080	3001720	So, uh, if you don't mind, I'm going to read this to the chat.
3001720	3005880	It says she fucking docs me ruined a production for women refuse to
3005880	3009520	contact us and is currently taking money for a game jam with no start
3009520	3011720	date, no location and no judges.
3011920	3012240	Okay.
3012240	3013200	Here's my story.
3013520	3017520	We ran a group that literally said any woman come up with an idea for a
3017520	3019480	video game will give you concept art.
3019680	3022960	So you can pitch your game and we'll put all the pitches online.
3023880	3025040	The internet will vote.
3025320	3028840	Uh, the internet will vote on the best one and we'll make that game.
3028920	3030480	And give the profits to charity.
3030720	3034240	If you get a lot of interest online and wants to make the game on your own,
3034440	3036360	you can leave the contest at any time.
3036680	3039640	Literally everyone that was in the top five didn't have programming
3039640	3042280	experience, so they couldn't make their game on their own.
3042760	3046800	She was like, why do you expect women to work for free and make games?
3046800	3051120	We said, well, they get 8% of the money as royalties and they just have
3051120	3054720	to give an idea other people will make the game and the profits go to charity.
3056200	3056840	Doesn't matter.
3056840	3057600	It's oppressive.
3057640	3061280	She started a fucking Twitter storm, crashed our website, got my personal
3061280	3063840	information docs, got us banned from Twitter.
3064080	3065760	We email reporter.
3065880	3067120	What what's up?
3067240	3068960	And they're like, duh.
3069000	3073720	If duh, if Zoe says it's oppressive, it must be true.
3074000	3077360	Maybe you should give her money for rebel jam, which has no start
3077360	3080880	date location or any other information, but totally isn't a scam.
3081200	3086000	This happens at three, eight, uh, three major, uh, online publications.
3086000	3089640	We literally said we'd pay her to consult on future projects and we
3089640	3093920	closed down the contest if she would explain to us what is exactly offensive.
3093960	3095520	No response, no response at all.
3096560	3099600	Unless a reporter contacted her and then she's the victim.
3099960	3102040	All this information is fucking online.
3102040	3103120	The pitches are online.
3103120	3107040	We did everything we said, but no online journalists will publish the story.
3108080	3108760	Please vote.
3109000	3115560	Even if we don't raise enough money, if, um, if show there's enough of a
3115600	3118800	interest, we can get the winner, a grant to make their game.
3118840	3121160	I am literally making no money on this contest.
3121160	3125440	I just wanted to focus on something other than women being oppressed.
3125680	3129560	I wanted to show that they made good games and everyone said, that's not
3129560	3131840	what women in games wants to talk about.
3133920	3143840	Um, so I guess that's their, their perspective, um, regarding the game jam.
3144240	3150320	Um, and, uh, one thing, let me see here.
3150840	3163480	Um, I remember seeing fine young capitalists and now the rational Wiki,
3163480	3173160	and I know you said this is like super slanted, um, it says here, uh, Matthew
3173160	3176960	rapper claims on Reddit that Zoe Quinn sabotaged their game jam and doxed
3176960	3178280	him without providing any proof.
3178680	3182040	The claims he made under his username by silly Slater, we deleted and or
3182080	3186960	edited later on, um, his accusation seems to be based on a conversation
3186960	3191320	with Zoe Quinn from March cop compiled by Metroid composite that was
3191320	3193040	apparently settled in private.
3193640	3194160	Um,
3199120	3199480	yeah.
3199480	3203560	And then on August 29th to find young capitalist backpedal on their claims.
3207600	3208040	Let's see.
3213160	3214960	I'm just trying to be as thorough as possible.
3215000	3215160	Nope.
3215160	3215640	It makes sense.
3215680	3218600	I'm also, this is all also like old lore for me too.
3218600	3221000	Is I don't have to like, look at it to jog my memory.
3221440	3225880	I'm pretty sure when it's kind of strange, this is from an era before the trend
3225880	3228480	stuff was like really center stage in the left.
3228480	3236880	So, um, a lot of the, a lot of the feminism of this era was kind of anti-trans, you
3236880	3240720	know, they, they still held the opinion that like trans women were male
3240720	3243920	infiltrators that wanted to destroy feminism and stuff like that.
3244400	3246760	The trans stuff didn't really come about till like 2017.
3247120	3253960	So, uh, I think, I think they dead name that the main person involved in find
3253960	3256200	young capitalists on this, this website.
3256200	3261400	Because yeah, it says Matthew Rapard and I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure that's a
3261400	3261800	girl.
3262280	3265320	Well, no, no, I mean, I don't get, I don't give a shit, but like, it's, it's just been
3265320	3268360	up, it's been up for so long and this is obviously like an old timeline.
3268840	3273400	So like people haven't edited this in years and back then dead naming was not a
3273400	3273960	big deal, right?
3274520	3275080	No one cared.
3276440	3278600	It's just, it's just strange to see how like things have changed.
3279160	3284120	Um, okay, let's see the poll board gets behind funding the fine young capitalist
3284120	3284680	crowd funding.
3284920	3287080	The fine young capitalist crowd funding campaign.
3287080	3288600	They call it operation chemo.
3290440	3292760	The crowd funding campaign, the fine young capitalist gets closed.
3295400	3298040	They blame it on Zoe Quinn without providing any proof.
3306040	3306440	Okay.
3307720	3314040	Well, it looks, it looks like on that image, if that's a true email, the Indiegogo team
3314920	3316440	is saying they're doing this for Zoe.
3317320	3321160	So this is back when Indiegogo was like at small companies, they could like send out
3321160	3322360	impersonal emails like this.
3323400	3323800	Let's see.
3323800	3325000	I'm trying to find what you're talking about.
3325640	3325880	Yeah.
3327720	3327960	Right.
3327960	3328200	Okay.
3329400	3329640	Yeah.
3329640	3331480	Back from their claim that Zoe Quinn docs are hacking them.
3331480	3331800	So that's.
3333000	3334360	And I'm trying to read this, but.
3335560	3338120	Lots of the links are broken and stuff on these old things, eh?
3338120	3338680	Yeah.
3338680	3339320	Yeah, they are.
3340520	3341880	Oh, fucking Lego butts.
3341880	3342680	Oh my God.
3342680	3348760	Oh, I'm just like getting brainwaves, man.
3350040	3350600	Oh, here it is.
3350600	3352280	Zoe Quinn didn't understand this project.
3352280	3355080	She decided to send some followers our way.
3355080	3356200	One of them docs me.
3356200	3357720	One of them sent a death threat.
3357720	3363000	Tons of them called me transphobic and the majority of said the project was exploitative.
3363000	3365560	It costed me money, a friend and a sponsor.
3365560	3366280	She fucked up.
3367880	3369400	I've been treated worse.
3369400	3370760	I rarely think about it anymore.
3370760	3374200	My greatest sin seems to be not pretending it didn't happen.
3375320	3375720	It happened.
3375720	3377080	She didn't know what she was doing.
3378840	3379960	Where is that?
3379960	3380440	Exactly.
3381000	3382200	I'm trying to find these pictures.
3382920	3384600	Yeah, it's not a picture.
3385160	3387160	The backpedal on their claims link works.
3389080	3390360	And so it's from that.
3390360	3390760	It happened.
3390760	3391800	She didn't know what she was doing.
3391800	3393960	Apparently she's not an omniscient God.
3393960	3396760	Except from heaven to purge the earth from human gamers.
3396760	3399480	She's just some woman that wants people to make games.
3400040	3403720	We wrote the statement slash piece for you with her specifically so that she could go
3403720	3406760	to PAX and point to it if anyone asked how we felt about her.
3407720	3413800	So they're saying that she directed followers our way and one of them docs me, but she herself
3413800	3414840	didn't docs me.
3414840	3416120	I still can't find that.
3416840	3421320	So on August 29th, it says the final capitalist backpedal on their claims at Zoe Quinn docs
3421320	3422120	to hack them.
3422120	3426520	When I go to that site, it takes me to a tumbler.
3427320	3428360	Oh, right, right, right.
3428360	3429240	No, no, no.
3429240	3430120	I was looking at a different page.
3430120	3430600	Sorry.
3430600	3431100	Yeah.
3432360	3433000	Right.
3433000	3437880	Find young capitalists are apologizing for getting punched in the face.
3437880	3438440	Right.
3438440	3438940	Okay.
3446360	3447320	I remember this now.
3447320	3448040	I remember this now.
3448040	3448540	Yeah.
3450840	3452040	I remember this now.
3452040	3457880	So yeah, Zoe Quinn showed up and apologized to them and they kind of patched things up
3457880	3466680	because this is like, this is this is during while it was blowing up, but it hadn't gotten
3466680	3467960	to its peak yet.
3467960	3470680	And I think the fine young capitalist, like they weren't in this for a culture war.
3470680	3472120	They just wanted to do their project, right?
3472120	3472920	They didn't.
3472920	3475720	So Zoe Quinn was going to come to them and apologize to them and say, listen, it's not
3475720	3476040	my fault.
3476040	3477160	They were going to accept the apology.
3479240	3483400	I remember I remember Zoe Quinn doing this a lot.
3483400	3487640	She was like running around in people's DMS trying to put out like every single fire that
3487640	3490200	she could lots of like, oh, it wasn't really me.
3490200	3491080	Oh, it was somebody else.
3491080	3491960	Oh, I'm sorry.
3491960	3493080	I didn't direct this harassment.
3493080	3493480	I didn't.
3493480	3494280	I didn't.
3494280	3499320	And it's like, okay, you know, sometimes sometimes your fans just kind of do what they're going
3499320	3500360	to do without your input.
3500360	3501720	You know, I've experienced that.
3501720	3504200	I'm sure like like like Sargon's experience.
3504200	3507320	I'm sure Destiny's experienced that, you know, like sometimes it just happens, right?
3507320	3509720	So that's definitely a reasonable excuse.
3512360	3517560	But like considering her behavior before and after gamer gate where like this kind of this
3518040	3524600	pattern of behavior from her, um, I don't think that like she docs anyone, but I also
3524600	3529160	don't think that she actually cared if one of her followers doc someone, I don't believe
3529160	3534440	it personally, just because like, as a gamer gate went on, we looked into like the drama
3534440	3536600	from that she got into before gamer gate.
3536600	3540440	There's a drama that she's been in since gamer gate and there's been like a consistent pattern
3540440	3547000	of behavior with this woman where it's been like, I'm not going to do anything about anything,
3547080	3552600	but you know, it, it, you know how like, you know how sometimes people will just like post
3552600	3557800	someone's name and address without an actual like threat of violence attached, but you
3557800	3560120	know, they're kind of like hoping someone's going to do something ridiculous.
3560680	3564600	This is like an on what Zoe Quinn is like an online variant of that where she'll like,
3565320	3570280	she'll go right up to the edge of actually saying something wrong, and then do that consistently.
3570920	3578280	So, um, so what drama was she involved in before gamer gate?
3578280	3578760	Do you know?
3580920	3586680	Oh, God, it's there was something about her, she moved to Toronto to avoid
3588440	3592120	some sort of like a divorce settlement or something because she was married.
3592680	3595080	And she actually like fled to Canada for a year or two.
3595080	3599880	I don't remember that the full details and then like basically once the legal
3599880	3602440	troubles kind of died down, she moved back to the States.
3604680	3609560	She just has like a history of these really toxic personal relationships where she's using people.
3611560	3613080	Aaron's only like one of many.
3614120	3614620	Yeah.
3615160	3615660	Yeah.
3616280	3617800	This me I can look this up.
3617800	3618520	Let's see.
3618520	3619020	Zoe.
3623160	3623660	Jesus.
3626040	3627000	Is this it?
3627000	3627720	Yeah, here we go.
3630120	3634520	So, Brianna, you said Brianna Woon and Anita Sarkeesian kind of inserted themselves into
3634520	3635640	the gamer gate stuff.
3636680	3641080	I'm assuming by like, posting something in response to it.
3642920	3648840	Um, yeah, basically, they like they saw like the, the culture war kick up, and they started
3648840	3652440	like commenting on it and saying I've been harassed to I've been harassed to give me give
3652440	3653800	me some attention guys.
3653800	3655960	Like there's there's a lot of that happening from those two.
3658760	3659720	Okay, yeah.
3659720	3661560	Here's right.
3661560	3664200	It was um, I think.
3665400	3666040	I see it here.
3666600	3671240	Brianna Woon lead developer at giant space cat studios decides to make a joke Twitter
3671240	3674600	account to mock gamer gators without mentioning them at all.
3674600	3677480	90 minutes past she reports being targeted by harassment.
3678040	3680440	I think I found the Toronto stuff with Zoe.
3681480	3685080	It's like another sexual assault allegation that ended up not panning out.
3685960	3687560	There's a bunch of those in her past.
3687560	3689080	So I think that's what this is.
3692920	3694600	This is like a research stream now.
3694600	3695800	I just ancient lore.
3696360	3697000	Sorry.
3697000	3698920	No, no, I enjoy this sort of thing.
3698920	3699420	Yeah.
3700920	3701420	Okay.
3702440	3704440	I think it's safe.
3704440	3704920	No, thanks.
3704920	3706760	I think I'm safe.
3706760	3707640	No, thanks to you.
3707640	3708680	Do not tweet at me again.
3708680	3710680	We will no longer be doing interviews with blank.
3713560	3718040	We have creator of they bleed pixels expressing his disgust for an individual who assaulted
3718040	3719960	Zoe Quinn at a gaming event.
3719960	3722360	The individual is respected amongst the gaming scene.
3723160	3726840	The individual explains himself, but they bleed pixels doesn't believe him.
3734920	3742200	Yeah, it looks like the black text is like what's explaining what's happening here since
3742200	3743640	a lot of it's been lost to time.
3744920	3745420	Yeah.
3748920	3749420	See here.
3750120	3755080	So then this Miguel says drunk isn't an excuse for behavior.
3755080	3756200	I was still in cold sober.
3756200	3758040	I saw how you acted and what you did.
3758040	3759240	Now please leave me alone.
3759960	3764840	Blank asking help usually requires you to say things rather than silently brooding.
3765080	3767720	Also doesn't require you to grab and injure Zoe.
3767720	3770920	And then this explanation text says Jesus does fucked up.
3770920	3772920	What would compel someone to act that way?
3772920	3775960	Rooting silently and then continuing to grab at Zoe's arm.
3775960	3776460	Weird.
3777400	3779160	Which I assume is like sarcastic.
3782120	3784120	Miguel says, oh, awesome.
3784120	3788200	Now he's giving my number out to his friends so that they can try and harass me too.
3788200	3788920	Thanks, asshole.
3790440	3793160	Weird how these people who harass Zoe always do it by phone.
3793240	3795480	So there's not really any proof of it ever happening.
3795480	3796920	It's almost like a wizard did it.
3798600	3801000	It's okay means blank is sorry.
3801000	3803400	He got drunk and assaulted Zoe.
3803400	3805880	We can forgive him because he's a dude centric.
3805880	3808040	He's in a dude centered biz, right?
3808040	3809160	What does this even mean?
3810120	3815480	This is how much he's prepared to defend Zoe and extrapolate the night's events for the cause.
3824040	3829400	I think it's going to be a common issue as all local indie communities grow.
3829400	3831160	We need to set a precedent, not cool.
3834040	3836920	The bleed pixels guy probably didn't realize how much Zoe was lying.
3836920	3839560	His behavior is really what we'd want good people to do.
3841080	3844840	They see what they believe to be a person being harassed and they step in and help.
3844840	3849240	Unfortunately, Zoe was using the nice events to spin this particular individual as a creep buck.
3849880	3854680	Really, he was a person Zoe was until recently involved with counting on a friend for help.
3854680	3857080	We also see here some of the rewards of white knighting.
3857080	3862200	It's got to feel great to have people congratulate you just for being a good person, right?
3862200	3865160	Okay.
3876840	3882280	Months later, the Toronto indie scene for the most part found out what Zoe's true nature really was.
3882280	3883640	She wasn't welcome there anymore.
3883640	3888520	She'd end up moving to San Francisco and living with Patricia Hernandez who promised to make her big.
3888600	3892760	Zoe now views Patricia as a hack who never made good on her promise.
3895160	3897400	Zoe and this individual had a brief fling.
3897400	3899000	He wanted more and Zoe didn't.
3899000	3901400	They decided to break it off but were still friends.
3901400	3906200	They both attended the event and when this individual got the news,
3906200	3911960	he thought Zoe would still be a friend he could trust to talk to and have some support.
3911960	3917400	He kept grabbing her arm trying to beg her to just listen because he was probably disintegrating internally.
3917400	3920120	Kind of a dick move to not just leave her alone
3920120	3923880	but he had been drinking and probably received some of the worst news of his life.
3923880	3927720	Instead, Zoe used it as an opportunity to make him look like a creep.
3927720	3932920	He got too close and actually wanted something meaningful so she used this as a clean out.
3932920	3937960	She said he was stalking and harassing her and essentially tried to ruin his reputation.
3937960	3940920	He kept his distance from her since that night.
3940920	3944840	Zoe would use this event as a so brave story about herself
3944840	3947960	saying her boss came on to her and dislocated her shoulder.
3949000	3952520	She was never employed by him, her shoulder was never dislocated,
3952520	3955880	and days later her friends saw her doing manual work with no discomfort.
3959800	3963240	Okay, so this is what happened prior to gamergate.
3963240	3963740	Yeah.
3964600	3965100	Yeah.
3965960	3968040	And there is at least a couple other stories,
3968040	3970680	but I mean they're going to require digging up in in the same thing.
3971560	3972360	Yeah, wow.
3973320	3976120	Um, another thing that happened was not your shield.
3976120	3976920	Did you hear about that?
3978120	3979480	I did not hear about that.
3979480	3980200	I'm so sorry.
3980920	3982600	I'm making you explain everything.
3982600	3983100	That's fine.
3984840	3991720	There was a claim for a while that the only people involved in gamergate were straight white men,
3991720	3993240	and that that's all it was.
3993240	3998200	And in response, a shit ton of people post pictures of themselves saying that no,
3998200	3999880	they were women and they were also pro gamergate.
4000520	4005240	They just weren't part of the, you know, the game journo indie clique.
4005800	4011480	They weren't in the club, you know, this image went viral on September 2nd.
4013160	4017560	Um, I still remember like half of these girls,
4019560	4022600	because it's 10 years later, they've all kind of like gone their separate ways.
4022600	4026600	I think shoe on head even posted one of these, one of these not your shield images.
4027240	4030120	Um, some of them have gone like far, right.
4030120	4031560	Some of them have gone far left.
4032200	4034440	Um, a few of them have left the internet entirely.
4035720	4037560	Some of them just don't make content anymore.
4038680	4046440	But basically a lot of these people, um, a lot of these people who were pro gamergate,
4046440	4048680	weren't just straight white men.
4048680	4054120	And there's a comic that you see sometimes where it's like a black woman who's going
4054120	4059240	to like explain something and then a white woman like puts her hand over the black woman's mouth
4059240	4060280	and says, you're oppressed.
4060280	4063160	Let me explain that came out of not your shield.
4063160	4064520	That was first drawn for not your shield.
4065480	4065800	Okay.
4067480	4068840	Okay, interesting.
4069400	4077640	Um, there's also Milo falsely accusing Zoe Quinn of embezzling money from their game.
4079000	4082920	And then accusing of lying about her police report.
4084920	4086680	Milo falsely abuses.
4086680	4088280	I'm always going to embezzling money.
4088280	4088920	What was this?
4096520	4100680	If you've donated money to I've Fred, why does that charity say you haven't?
4100680	4102840	How much money has depression quest raised?
4102840	4110200	What percentage of that money have you donated to, um, to date to I've Fred?
4110200	4115720	Oh, I see what's going on.
4115720	4116520	Okay.
4116520	4116840	Okay.
4117400	4122360	So Zoe Quinn said that, um, the proceeds from her game depression quest, at least a portion
4122360	4125160	of them will be donated to I've Fred, which is a depression charity.
4125880	4128040	And Milo called her up, asked for a comment.
4128040	4129000	Zoe hung up on him.
4130200	4140120	Um, I've Fred confirmed that Zoe, that no one had donated to, uh, to them from this
4140120	4140840	game.
4140840	4144520	Um, the issue is depression quest is a free game.
4145640	4145880	Yeah.
4145880	4147800	There's no, there's no profits to be made.
4147800	4151080	So I guess Zoe Quinn technically did donate a portion of all of her profits, which is
4151080	4152280	a portion of zero.
4152280	4153960	So it's not a false statement.
4153960	4155160	It's just kind of a misleading one.
4155960	4156200	Yeah.
4156840	4163480	Um, however, even though you could interpret this as Milo being wrong, you can interpret
4163480	4168440	this as Zoe being sneaky, whatever, even though, even if you say that this story didn't happen,
4168440	4171880	Zoe did later embezzle money for a different game after gamer gate.
4173880	4175640	And that's not going to be improved in this timeline.
4175640	4178120	Cause she did it like three years later, but she did embezzle money for a game.
4178760	4179000	Yeah.
4180040	4184440	There was like, uh, do you know the room, the terrible movie, the room?
4185000	4185240	Yeah.
4185880	4186040	Yeah.
4186040	4190600	Remember the guy that played Mark with like the ginger beard, that guy?
4190600	4191320	Yeah.
4191320	4195960	She hired that guy to do an FMV game where he was the star.
4196840	4200360	She raised a shit ton of money and then she just never put it out.
4200360	4202840	And whenever you ask her, she's like, yeah, I spent all the money.
4202840	4203160	Sorry.
4203160	4204280	She just admits it.
4204280	4204440	Yeah.
4204440	4205400	There's no more money.
4205400	4206120	Really?
4206120	4206440	Wow.
4208760	4211480	Um, okay.
4211480	4213000	So I'm going to find that.
4213000	4213320	Hold on.
4215320	4216840	This is a post gamer gate drama.
4216840	4219000	So it's, let's see.
4221400	4222200	Let me find it.
4226360	4226760	Come on.
4229320	4231080	This was back in 2018.
4233240	4234280	There's like layers.
4234280	4235720	So you have to like keep digging down.
4237480	4237720	Yeah.
4246760	4249400	So we quit an FMV game, no info since over six months.
4250520	4251000	Come on.
4255960	4259640	So we Quinn steals $85,000 from gullible Kickstarters.
4261240	4265000	Give me something more concrete than just a, uh, a forum post talking about it.
4268920	4269960	Will this give us something?
4272360	4273160	Yeah, here we go.
4275400	4276200	Here's an article.
4281880	4283160	Uh, kick scams.
4283960	4284440	Yep.
4284440	4286280	They just, they cover Kickstarter scams.
4286280	4287560	She was obvious from the name, right?
4288360	4288760	Yeah.
4288760	4291080	Project tingler kickstarted in the butt.
4292520	4294760	So Quinn and Chuck tingle FMV game.
4296280	4296520	Okay.
4298920	4304120	Um, although she continues to solicit PayPal donations for the, for development
4304120	4307480	Quinn's Kickstarter account has not been accessed since April, 2018.
4307480	4316280	Um, project tingler has yet to leave the pre-alpha stage of development.
4317480	4324760	Um, yeah, it raised $15,000 beyond its original Kickstarter goal and promises
4324760	4326440	of early access and sneak peaks.
4327000	4333240	Um, updates have become increasingly rare questions and concerns from backers
4333240	4336600	are routinely neglected for periods up to and exceeding six months.
4337240	4341000	Um, uh, let's see.
4345000	4348280	Twitter messages to lead developers, Zoe Quinn and project manager,
4348280	4350120	John E. Warren remain unanswered.
4350120	4352360	Despite both being active users of the platform.
4353400	4358920	Um, author chunk Chuck tingle, who's fictional universe project tingler set
4358920	4362520	has responded with hostility to those exasperated by the lack of communication.
4367560	4368920	Um, yep.
4370760	4374360	Um, the LDR is still working on it just slower because I ran out of money
4374360	4376760	a long time ago and had to get day jobs.
4376760	4380760	Also, I have been working on ways to bring on some assistance with finishing it.
4380760	4382280	Also don't yell at Chuck about it.
4382280	4383720	Shipping the game is on me.
4385800	4387800	Um, Hey, and then.
4388280	4389480	Oh, I see.
4389480	4395320	This is a response to the, yeah, the, the, she, these are two tweets that she
4395320	4401000	sent as time went on regarding where the money went in the second one.
4401000	4402040	She just says ran out of money.
4402120	4402600	Sorry.
4404280	4405320	Ran out of money a long time ago.
4405320	4408680	Not cool with asking people to work for free, got a day job to start crawling
4408680	4412760	out of debt and in a place where I can properly finish it, this is the day job.
4412760	4413240	I'm not sure.
4413240	4413800	I'm not sure.
4413800	4414360	I'm not sure.
4415240	4418200	And in a place where I can properly finish it, this is the day job.
4420920	4426040	Uh, the issue ultimately is, is while she's posting stuff like this,
4426040	4428040	she's also posting stuff like this.
4433320	4436680	And so people are saying, Hey, we're donating all this money to you.
4436680	4439720	And you're saying that you ran out of money to actually finish the game.
4439720	4443640	Where are you getting the money to go on these trips and do it and do these things?
4445160	4448440	Time to stop being bitter about the people trying to stop my joy and bad
4448440	4452520	faith and go back to appreciating the fact that I get to be too busy with
4452520	4456120	making cool shit that I love to completely goof off in Tokyo.
4456120	4459880	One awesome problem I get to have, just like the awesome problem of the
4459880	4464280	ryokan owner telling me she had to swap out the yukata in my room for the
4464280	4466520	big booby yukata instead, bless her.
4468200	4468520	Okay.
4469160	4469880	Yeah.
4469880	4470200	Oops.
4471080	4476680	Um, yeah, so basically it's been years and years and years.
4476680	4478520	A bunch of money has just vanished.
4478520	4479960	There seems to be no accountability.
4480520	4483320	So it's, it's pretty, it's pretty clear where it went.
4483320	4486840	This is like the, where did, where did all Keflez's money go, guys?
4486840	4488440	It's kind of the same thing, you know?
4488440	4489560	Yeah, yeah.
4491320	4492680	Um, wow.
4492680	4493000	Okay.
4493080	4497720	This is, um, this is really good going through like, oh, clearly slanted,
4497720	4501880	um, timeline and like, and getting your take on these things since you
4501880	4503560	have like a different perspective.
4503560	4506440	Um, yeah, yeah.
4506440	4509480	Um, so it's very clearly slanted.
4509480	4515320	And yes, so Milo also accused me of falsely of lying about a police report.
4515320	4516360	I want to see what that link is.
4516600	4518200	Falsely of lying about a police report.
4518200	4519320	I want to see what that link is.
4524680	4526520	Oh, that, I think that link's dead now.
4527640	4529560	Whatever it was, it's not leading to anything anymore.
4531240	4534840	Um, my listeners and Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian get to debunk.
4536040	4543160	Um, you can see if I can, uh, the debunking is that Sarkeesian,
4544040	4547720	her case is being actually handled by the FBI.
4547720	4550520	So, um,
4558680	4559240	okay, let's see.
4562760	4563240	Okay.
4563240	4564120	Is this it?
4564120	4564360	Okay.
4564360	4564440	Yeah.
4564440	4565800	Cause that link is, is dead.
4565800	4570280	It looks like, so this is from during the initial days of gamer gate where
4570280	4572440	Anita claimed that she was driven out of her house.
4573160	4578680	Um, by trolls posting, you know, her address to her or something.
4581880	4583400	Um, it's,
4590120	4591880	uh, that's not the debunked part.
4591880	4597000	The debunked part is like Milo tweeting that he talked with, um,
4597000	4602440	that he talked with SFPD and they say that the Sarkeesian case is being dealt with by the FBI.
4602440	4602680	Yeah.
4602680	4607960	That's this image here, which is Milo's old Milo and Mike Cernovich is old.
4607960	4608440	Oh yeah.
4608440	4609400	I don't know if you knew this.
4609400	4611400	Mike Cernovich got his start in gamer gate too.
4612360	4613320	Oh really?
4613320	4613560	Yep.
4615000	4615560	Man.
4615560	4616040	Okay.
4616040	4617960	I haven't, this is going to be a bit of a side story.
4617960	4620040	I haven't heard of Mike Cernovich since gamer gate.
4620040	4621000	I know he's been floating around.
4621000	4622920	He's been like, he wrote the gorilla mindset.
4622920	4627240	He's been selling like the gorilla drugs to like get people to they're like
4627240	4628360	caffeine enhancers or something.
4628360	4632040	I don't fucking know what they are, but like he's, he's kind of tried to hop on the,
4632040	4635320	um, the manosphere train, right?
4636280	4636520	Man.
4636520	4641320	I did, I did a video on, um, on Andrew Tate, I think two days ago, just like a,
4641320	4645560	an update on some of the things because, um, you know who Nick Monroe is?
4646600	4647000	I don't.
4647000	4647960	Who's that?
4647960	4649000	Do you know crab crawler?
4650200	4650680	Yeah.
4650680	4651160	On Twitter?
4651720	4652280	Yeah, I know.
4652280	4653240	That's a secret account.
4653240	4654920	Don't tell anyone that's Nick Monroe.
4654920	4656760	Nick Monroe is an investigative journalist.
4657560	4662760	And he first got big live tweeting some trials four or five years back.
4662760	4663800	And I've talked to him a bunch of times.
4663800	4664360	He's a good guy.
4665000	4669560	Uh, but his whole thing is like deep dives, gamer gate style, deep dives.
4669880	4675160	And he, I, I basically did a video, uh, crediting him and putting all of his
4675160	4677480	research into, into video format.
4677960	4682280	But he did a big ass thread where he discovered that Mike Cernovich was in
4682920	4689560	Andrew Tate's war room, selling his, selling his gorilla drugs to Andrew
4689560	4691160	Tate and other people there.
4691160	4692600	That's wild.
4692600	4694040	I think I remember that actually.
4694040	4695400	That's wild.
4695400	4695640	Yeah.
4696680	4700840	And so when Andrew Tate says, yeah, I make my girls do 16 hour days in front
4700840	4705080	of the camera, a crab crawler was like, listen, are you giving them the gorilla
4705080	4706040	drugs to keep them going?
4706040	4707400	Like what's going on here?
4707400	4707720	What is.
4709320	4709800	Wow.
4710680	4711080	Yeah.
4713240	4716040	So you just outed a secret on stream.
4716040	4719640	Oh, what that, uh, that Nick Monroe is crab crawler.
4719960	4720440	Yeah.
4721240	4725080	I think it's like Sammy public knowledge at this point.
4725880	4726280	Okay.
4726920	4727160	Wow.
4727160	4730360	He was like perma band from Twitter for a while for unearthing the wrong
4730360	4734920	secrets for live tweeting about the wrong trials, but, uh, he came back and
4734920	4738040	now that Elon's back, no one cares anymore, you know, now that Elon's in
4738040	4738680	control of things.
4739400	4739800	Yeah.
4740760	4748520	No, I still see people getting like wrecked by Twitter, like TOS or whatever.
4749320	4750840	Um, yeah, I was banned for a week.
4751960	4752520	Yeah.
4752520	4752920	Yeah.
4752920	4754840	What for, what did you get banned for?
4754840	4762440	Um, I said that being trans was a mental illness and because it's gender
4762440	4766840	dysphoria and transitioning is the proper medical treatment for the illness.
4767000	4772680	And if you try to make being trans and aesthetic and not a mental illness,
4773000	4775320	you're going to completely remove the medical side of it.
4775320	4777400	And now suddenly a bunch of trans people are going to be left without their
4777400	4777880	healthcare.
4778600	4783080	So you can, you guys need to chill the fuck down, but you guys, you guys need
4783080	4786440	to calm down with this shit because you're, you're ruining things for trans
4786440	4786840	people.
4787160	4788520	And that got me banned for a week.
4789080	4789800	Wow.
4789880	4791800	I can't believe that got you banned.
4792600	4793080	Yep.
4793480	4794200	It's true too.
4794360	4797720	I know it's, I know it's kind of spicy, but it's true.
4798520	4803400	Like, I mean, you know that you have to argue then what is the justification
4803400	4807480	of like giving, um, like medical treatment to all these trans people with
4807480	4808920	just an aesthetic that you can claim.
4809480	4809880	Yeah.
4809880	4810440	Yeah.
4810440	4813320	There's a clip that I use over and over and maybe I can actually find it for
4813320	4813480	you.
4813480	4813880	Hold on.
4813880	4825880	If I can't find it for you, I'll upload it because fuck.
4825880	4826360	It's funny.
4827480	4828040	Is this it?
4828600	4829240	No, it's not it.
4829240	4829560	Fuck.
4830600	4831880	Come on internet.
4831880	4835560	Help me out.
4843880	4849880	Oh, maybe I can't.
4849880	4850520	God damn it.
4851080	4851320	Yeah.
4851880	4854680	I wonder if it's small enough that I can just send it to you over for
4854680	4855160	discord.
4861080	4864840	A lot of people tuned in for your gamer gate summary.
4865560	4865880	Really?
4866440	4867640	What's the numbers looking like?
4868600	4871320	There's like 155 on YouTube right now.
4871320	4871960	Oh, nice.
4871960	4872840	Hi guys.
4872840	4873240	What's up?
4874840	4877640	Yeah, I'll upload it like privately.
4878440	4884600	I'll set it to, I use this clip so much in my videos because it's so ridiculous.
4884600	4885640	It's one of those stock clips.
4885640	4887960	I just keep around whenever I have to bring it up.
4891960	4892440	Okay.
4892440	4894680	Uh, unlisted.
4894680	4895400	This should be good.
4895960	4898520	Everybody's saying, um, hi dev to you.
4899960	4900280	Hello.
4903880	4904440	What was it?
4905720	4906440	I'm here for dev.
4906440	4907320	I'm a fan of him.
4907320	4908280	Yeah, I'm a fan too.
4908280	4909400	He's pretty cool.
4909400	4910120	Oh, well, thank you.
4910920	4911880	Nice to meet you.
4911880	4912840	Sundance.
4912840	4913640	Excuse me.
4913640	4914520	What did you call me?
4915640	4917320	Is your name Sundance?
4917320	4918520	It is not Sundance.
4919080	4919720	Okay.
4919720	4920280	Watch this.
4922920	4923240	Okay.
4923240	4924840	It would be the.
4930280	4932040	It's a minute, so I'll just kind of sit back and.
4933160	4933400	Okay.
4994680	4996920	So, okay.
4996920	4998840	So you're going to have to explain to me because I didn't get it.
4998840	4999320	I'm sorry.
5000040	5000520	Oh, no.
5001400	5002120	No, I didn't.
5002120	5003880	Well, let me, let me play it again.
5003880	5004120	Okay.
5004120	5005880	It might take me, it might take me a minute.
5005880	5013720	I'm sorry.
5018920	5021080	It's just like a, for me, it's just like, okay.
5021640	5025480	Uh, you know, typical retarded take, but yeah.
5025480	5025720	Yes.
5025720	5025960	Yes.
5025960	5027560	I mean, it is just a typical retarded take.
5027560	5027800	Yeah.
5028360	5035000	But if you want like a single sound clip that completely demolishes the entire, the entire
5035960	5038360	leftist view on what being trans is, it's this one.
5039080	5044520	If gender actually is just an aesthetic as she claims, then there's no reason for any
5044520	5046920	of it to be covered in terms of medical costs.
5046920	5049080	There's no reason for anyone to respect it.
5049080	5050600	You know, like, why would you?
5050600	5054600	Cause you shouldn't respect it any more than you would respect someone's choice of clothing,
5054600	5056120	which is sometimes inappropriate.
5056120	5059320	And sometimes it's not part of your identity anymore.
5059320	5065640	You know, like this, this one line of logic destroys everything that trans people have
5065640	5069160	been trying to build for pretty much ever.
5070440	5070760	Yeah.
5071800	5076440	So I keep this in my, I keep this in my back pocket and I'm like, listen, if I ever need
5076440	5078600	to like pull out, Oh, here's something retarded.
5079240	5080280	I have it ready to go.
5081080	5081320	Yeah.
5082520	5083000	Yeah.
5083000	5084840	It's, it's pretty retarded.
5084840	5091720	It's up there with, I think I remember seeing this actually and just being like, okay, really?
5092360	5092520	Yeah.
5093160	5093400	Yeah.
5099480	5099800	Wow.
5102120	5106520	So I'm, I guess I'm going to have to like look through the more of this gamergate stuff,
5106520	5108280	but like, what were you talking about before?
5108280	5108600	Yeah.
5108600	5109400	Hold on.
5109400	5109640	Yeah.
5109960	5113000	Jesse single gets involved in this and writes a,
5115720	5119000	you know, writes a, writes a, an article about it.
5126120	5130360	Mike Cernovich goes after a nil dash in the name of gamergate for no apparent reason.
5130920	5133320	Dash has never written about gamergate or video games,
5133320	5135560	but has a history of Cernovich stalking him.
5135560	5136680	What is that?
5136680	5137000	Sure.
5137000	5137320	Let's see.
5139640	5141080	Mike Cernovich goes after, huh?
5142760	5144040	Who's a nil dash?
5145800	5147080	I have no idea.
5147720	5147880	Yeah.
5147880	5149640	This, I don't know what this part is at all.
5151160	5152760	So this is all news to me.
5154920	5157880	I mean, I'm not surprised that Mike Cernovich ended up being kind of a grifter.
5160680	5160920	Yeah.
5161720	5162120	Let's see.
5162120	5163160	He goes after him.
5164040	5167640	Um, I don't know what this is, but.
5168440	5170120	Let's see what this is.
5173480	5187640	When the gamergate mob targeted a nil dash for no reason.
5191640	5192840	SJWs are bullies.
5192840	5193400	I hate bullies.
5193400	5194680	How do you handle a mob of bullies?
5194680	5196440	You single them out one by one.
5196440	5198840	Docs, Docs, Docs, Docs, Docs.
5201480	5207320	Oh, someone in your chat quickly asked, isn't the dear gender weirdo on some sort of mod
5207320	5208040	team for Twitch?
5208040	5210200	No, there's actually two dear gender weirdos.
5213160	5213720	Fucking hell.
5214440	5215640	There's multiples of them.
5215640	5215880	Yes.
5216760	5217400	There's a herd.
5218520	5218840	Yeah.
5219640	5220600	Well, there's two.
5220600	5223080	I don't know if two makes a herd, but maybe.
5223800	5224040	Yeah.
5224920	5229560	If believing the first amendment in due process makes me a sociopath, then I'm guilty as charged.
5229560	5230680	Aaron is a nice guy.
5230680	5232200	I, on the other hand, am not so nice.
5232200	5234280	I play a lot meaner than SJWs.
5234280	5237320	Just wait till I issue subpoenas and start doxing.
5237320	5238200	Holy shit.
5238200	5241240	Mike Cernovich is like fucking unhinged in these tweets.
5241800	5242040	Yeah.
5243240	5244200	Back in the old days.
5246280	5249400	Now that this is a story that completely went by me, I have no clue that this happened.
5254040	5274120	I don't know.
5274120	5280120	It looks like gamer gate ended up just being a massive W for the pro gamer gators.
5280120	5288760	I mean, kind of, kind of not, because if you look at the state of video game development
5288760	5292680	right now, it's certainly more woke than it was back then.
5292680	5294280	And they didn't want that.
5294280	5296840	So I think a lot of them view it as like a massive loss.
5296840	5302120	You know, none of the people that they discovered to be, I guess with the exception of Phil
5302120	5306280	Fish, none of the people that were discovered to have been doing anything wrong ever got
5306280	5307080	punished for it.
5307080	5308120	They never lost their jobs.
5308120	5309880	They never lost their positions.
5309880	5311160	They in fact got promotions.
5311160	5316680	You know, Nathan Grayson moved on from Kotaku to the Washington Post.
5316680	5319320	I think like Steven Toledo.
5319320	5320680	I think he moved on to somewhere else too.
5320680	5322280	Like basically their careers kept going.
5323880	5329080	A few indie developers that like some of the worst people kind of had their careers collapse.
5329080	5330840	Like nobody pays attention to Zoe Quinn anymore.
5330840	5331640	No one cares.
5331640	5334680	Nobody pays attention to Nia Sarkeesian anymore.
5334680	5336040	You know, like her channel is dead.
5336040	5340280	It gets like it gets like 100 views a video with like a million subs or something like
5340280	5341000	it's a dead channel.
5343160	5348200	Brianna Wu, I think is only relevant because she stopped doing game development and tried
5348200	5349480	to run for office.
5349480	5351800	So she completely jumped into a different sphere.
5352360	5355240	So I think she kind of survived by just getting out of gaming.
5358040	5365160	Yeah, like if you pull up what gets promoted on, let's say the latest Nintendo Direct or
5365160	5371640	the latest Sony State of Play, what's pushed to the front of the websites, what's pushed
5371640	5374360	to the front of these news outlets.
5374360	5379960	You know, it's all stuff that gamer gators would have hated to see 10 years ago.
5379960	5382040	So I don't think that they view it as a win.
5384440	5384940	Really?
5386680	5388200	Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
5388200	5392200	I feel like, isn't that just, couldn't that just be like the natural progression of things
5392200	5398920	as we get into more like globalized multicultural, you know, society, like things just naturally
5398920	5402360	get more like that.
5403640	5409160	Maybe it's not necessarily like a loss on gamer gate's side.
5410360	5412520	Are you doing the whole Cthulhu swims left thing?
5413800	5415240	I don't know what that is.
5415240	5415800	Oh, hold on.
5418440	5419320	It's an expression.
5420200	5420700	Right.
5421080	5422600	It's from Moldbug.
5422600	5425400	Cthulhu may swim slowly, but he only swims left.
5426920	5428440	You said Moldbug was based yesterday.
5428440	5429560	I remember that comment.
5430440	5435560	Well, okay, there were, I only read a little bit of some of the stuff you were saying.
5435560	5440120	Like, I'm not saying he, I said he had some base, some base takes.
5440120	5441640	I didn't say he himself was based.
5441640	5442140	Okay.
5442140	5445400	So Stardust is going on the Neo reactionary arc, guys.
5445400	5446120	It's going to happen.
5447480	5448280	It's going to happen.
5450280	5453640	Um, the idea basically, you know what?
5453640	5455800	I think a better way to, okay, hold on.
5455800	5464840	Robert conquest, three laws of politics, which law was it?
5467240	5467740	Which one?
5469400	5471960	Um, what was the intended director could talk to?
5471960	5474280	Which one were you saying people would hate what they see?
5474840	5475480	Hold on a second.
5475480	5477880	Um, right.
5477880	5482440	Any organization, not explicitly right-wing sooner or later becomes left-wing.
5483240	5487000	That's the underlying idea behind Cthulhu swims left.
5487000	5490360	So basically like culture is always progressing leftward over time.
5490360	5491560	It's not progressing rightward.
5492280	5496360	I don't think that that's necessarily true because the Neo conservative win of Reagan
5496360	5499320	and Thatcher in the eighties kind of proved that decisively wrong.
5499320	5503480	You know, there are the flagging economies in the west of the 70 that were kind of bogged
5503480	5507800	down by a lot of social spending, got revitalized by new conservatism.
5507800	5512280	So it's, I don't think this is a true statement that things always moved left-leaning, but
5512280	5515320	they've certainly moved left-leaning consistently in the past 30 years.
5515880	5517480	And I think some people just don't like that.
5518680	5522680	Well, yeah, I'm not trying to say that like things always have to move left-leaning, but
5523880	5529720	my more of what I would be saying is like, we live in a increasingly globalized society.
5530360	5534040	Like, you know, globalization is, you know, very widespread.
5534040	5540840	Culture, you know, has been exported to a lot of different places and we're very multicultural
5540840	5543480	society now as a whole.
5543480	5547080	So like us being a multicultural society.
5547080	5552200	Now, I don't know what, like, was it Kotaku you said that people would not like what's
5553080	5555080	being shown on the front page or whatever?
5558360	5559480	I think so, yes.
5559480	5563080	Like that's what gamers would not like if they went to like the front page of, of even
5563080	5565560	maybe even steam, not, not, not steam is pretty impartial still.
5565560	5570760	But if you go to the front page of Kotaku or polygon, I think the games that are featured
5570760	5575480	or the political slants that are pushed people who were in gamer gate, if they could like
5575480	5576840	see the future, they probably wouldn't like it.
5578120	5578440	Yeah.
5578440	5584440	I mean, I guess if it's, if it's like, I don't know, like, I guess I was just thinking more
5584440	5587640	about like representation in video games and stuff like that.
5587640	5592120	But if it's just like straight up, like left wing, like politics that are being pushed,
5592120	5596440	then yeah, I could see people not liking that and seeing it kind of like a failure.
5597080	5602840	The thing is like gaming was kind of unique because people never had a problem with representation
5602840	5603560	in it before.
5603560	5606920	You know, if you go back to the 90s, you go back to the Super Nintendo, the Nintendo 64,
5606920	5611160	the PlayStation one, you could find black characters, no problem.
5611160	5613320	Female protagonists, you could find all this shit.
5613880	5616680	And, and they had like real things to do real stories.
5616680	5620360	It wasn't like a captain Marvel situation or a Ray Skywalker situation.
5620360	5623480	If we're going to go down like the quartering route here, where they have like these female
5623480	5626920	characters that have no arcs, they undergo no growth.
5626920	5629000	They don't suffer and like overcome and get better.
5629000	5631000	They're just bad-ass from the start.
5631000	5631720	And then they just win.
5631720	5633400	And it's not really an interesting story.
5633400	5639720	You know, you actually find female characters in video games who suffered and became heroic
5639720	5641000	like male characters did.
5641000	5643080	That's been in gaming since before I was born.
5643960	5649240	So I just think that like this whole, we need more diversity in games.
5649240	5652440	It always just ringed hollow to anyone who knew, you know?
5653960	5657480	No, I mean, I'm not saying that that sentiment itself was correct.
5657480	5660360	I'm just saying like, I don't know.
5660360	5668440	I saw, I see like people freaking out about their being more representation and it seems
5668440	5675640	kind of like, well, I'm not saying that we should push for it, but maybe they're being
5675640	5680280	more than there was prior is kind of like a natural progression of things, you know?
5680920	5688520	But I think the ultimate issue is just that the games suck, but they hide behind.
5688520	5690040	They hide behind representation.
5690040	5693400	It's like, Oh, well, your game actually controls really poorly and it's not very fun to play.
5693400	5695320	Oh, but it has a black female protagonist.
5695320	5696920	If you complain, you're a bigot.
5696920	5697960	It's something like that.
5698600	5699640	And you saw a lot of that too.
5700280	5701960	Yeah, for sure.
5701960	5703480	I can definitely see that.
5703480	5710280	Like with games and stuff, like with comics, like there've always been female protagonists
5710280	5713080	in comics and in superhero comics and all of that.
5713080	5715000	So, yeah.
5715960	5717720	And they've always been pretty complex.
5719560	5723160	So it's not anything new, like you said, but.
5723160	5723800	Yeah, yeah.
5724440	5734920	I was watching you watch Destiny and Richard Spencer talk last night, and there was something
5734920	5739000	that you just said that was kind of related to that, where it's like, there's the globalization
5739000	5744360	of culture and things are kind of becoming more mixed and these ideas are spreading around
5744360	5745160	more quickly.
5745160	5750280	I remember, like, I think both Destiny and Richard Spencer agreed that something's been
5750280	5752600	lost in the globalization, right?
5753400	5762040	Yeah, the individual identity, people more easily found.
5762760	5768120	I think it's harder for people to kind of feel like they're individualistic nowadays
5768120	5769880	because everything is so widespread.
5769880	5770280	I don't know.
5770280	5771240	Maybe that's just my.
5771960	5773880	Yeah, that's definitely part of it.
5773880	5778600	There's also like, I think Destiny used the example of Nirvana, where they were just like
5778600	5782280	being shitty in a garage and they were discovered and they blew up.
5782280	5787560	And it was this kind of like, almost like music that was anti music because it was so
5787560	5794440	it was so grungy, you know, but now everything is just kind of pre packaged and pre built
5794440	5799880	and pre made and nothing like the Internet was a breath of fresh air because things could
5799880	5800360	go viral.
5800360	5803800	But even on the Internet now, like a lot of things that are going viral or like just kind
5803800	5804840	of push to go viral.
5804840	5806440	It's not organic anymore.
5806440	5807800	It's all kind of like pre planned.
5808760	5814280	And in my, I forget how I worded it.
5814280	5820040	I, you watched the video, it was the video about being indigenous.
5820040	5821400	What does it mean to be indigenous?
5821400	5826120	I made the point that there's a lot of people who are, let's say far left, you know, they're
5826120	5830520	socialists and they hate capitalist economics, right?
5830520	5835640	They say that it turns people into disposable workers and everyone's just replaceable.
5835640	5839160	And it doesn't actually respect the dignity of individuals.
5839160	5845000	And it's a, the complaint is that it makes everything and everyone disposable.
5845000	5847640	And that's like one of capitalism's greatest sins.
5848280	5853480	The problem with the socialists are somewhat correct when they say that, that that's true.
5853480	5861320	But the issue is the other half of the left, which is the progressives, they want to, you
5861400	5866440	know, mix cultures, have more open borders, more immigrants.
5866440	5872840	And what ends up happening is that with the cultural mix, you also get the economic fungibility.
5872840	5877800	They kind of come hand in hand where like you, if you, I don't want to put this, it's
5877800	5883080	something like, it's something like, fuck, how did I say it?
5884360	5884840	I don't know.
5884840	5887800	I said it so well in the video and now that I'm live streaming, I can't say it anymore.
5888520	5895720	It it's, it's basically something along the lines of like the interchangeability that
5896360	5902840	socialists decry when it comes to capitalism comes hand in hand with this, with the cultural
5902840	5907640	interchangeability that naturally happens as a result of globalization and progressivism.
5908760	5912040	And so in some senses, the left causes its own problem.
5912040	5920120	And I don't think that socialists will ever want to admit that, but I think it's true.
5922920	5925000	Can you repeat what you just said one more time?
5925000	5928600	The, what you, the line you were trying so hard to.
5928600	5931000	Yeah, I'll try, I'll try it again.
5931000	5932920	So I'm like, I already have lost it.
5932920	5938600	It's, it's something, it's something like the interchangeability in economics that
5938600	5945720	socialists decry capitalism for having, they are partially caused by the interchangeability
5945720	5950920	in culture that progressive is pushed for when they push for globalization and borders
5950920	5952920	and the merging of cultures and stuff.
5952920	5953320	Yeah.
5953320	5953560	Yeah.
5953560	5958840	So, so, so in some ways the left causes its own capitalist problem.
5960200	5962120	Yeah, I could see that 100%.
5963640	5967800	That's because you're not a socialist, a socialist will never admit that for them.
5967800	5972040	It's always going to be like Marxist historical materialism and the contradictions of capitalism
5972040	5974440	and all this shit, but like they, Oh man.
5974440	5974680	Okay.
5975640	5978040	There's a near reactionary writer named Nick land.
5978920	5982760	And he basically agreed with everything that the socialists said, not everything, not everything.
5982760	5984120	No, that's not, that's not accurate.
5984120	5988360	He agreed with a lot of what the socialists said, but he said that the contradictions
5988360	5993480	in capitalism were human beings and abolishing capitalism and abolishing people.
5994040	5999320	And that's when you get into like the technocratic future where you have AI's running everything
6000040	6002920	and AI's producing all the goods and all the services.
6002920	6004760	And eventually they're just going to do away with humans.
6004760	6006920	That's like the doomsday AI future.
6006920	6007480	You know what I mean?
6008040	6008280	Yeah.
6009560	6011080	Oh, the chat says, Stardust seems bored.
6011080	6011800	Sorry.
6011800	6012920	No, I'm not bored.
6012920	6013640	I'm not bored.
6013640	6024040	I guess I'm just trying to like, because this is a little bit above my head.
6025400	6032280	But okay.
6033720	6041160	So I can definitely see that like the multiculturalism can, you know,
6041160	6046040	and the pushing of progressive values and open borders and all of that leads to a lot
6046040	6053640	of these, you know, downfalls of the economic system that like we operate under.
6055080	6062840	And I can see that, where was I going with this?
6071400	6074040	It's time to take the neo reactionary pill, Stardust.
6077480	6081880	Well, there is something like, okay, there's like a loss of individuality.
6082760	6084120	And I think there's a loss.
6084120	6086600	There's a little bit of a loss of community too, right?
6086600	6087880	Like, well, not just a little bit.
6087880	6089560	There's a huge loss of community.
6089560	6091480	There's not just a loss of individuality.
6091480	6094840	There's a loss of community, which is really strange to think about.
6094840	6100600	Like both of these things happening simultaneously as a result of this,
6100600	6103160	you know, increasingly multicultural society.
6103960	6105080	But it makes sense.
6105080	6108200	And I almost think that the fracturing of the internet is like,
6109160	6113320	this is funny, because this is something that like JF Gorepi was saying that he thinks
6113320	6117560	would happen, that there would be a fracturing of the internet.
6118600	6120280	And not just him.
6120280	6124040	Other people have talked about it like that, you know, there are different countries with
6124040	6127960	their own internets now and, you know.
6127960	6129320	And I think I said this too.
6129400	6133160	I did a video in like 2016 called the Balkanization of Technology.
6133160	6139480	It was right after like the, that James Guy put out, it was some kind of engineering
6139480	6144120	document regarding how do you get more women into engineering spots in Google.
6144120	6147400	He got fired for it because he spoke honestly about what the problem was.
6147400	6148680	Oh, do you remember that at all?
6149240	6150360	I don't remember that, no.
6150920	6151560	Really?
6151560	6152280	It was a big thing.
6152280	6153960	I did a video about it like 2016.
6153960	6159080	And my view was that the internet was going to Balkanize.
6159080	6161320	And we'd have like right-wing websites and left-wing websites.
6161320	6162600	You have right-wing Twitter, left-wing Twitter.
6162600	6162920	Yeah, we see that.
6162920	6164920	You have gaming Twitter, you know.
6164920	6166120	Yeah, we're seeing it, yeah.
6166920	6173320	Yeah, so with that being said, you know, I think JF was saying that he could see it happening.
6173320	6176680	And this is what I was trying to explain to Destiny earlier with like the Fediverse and
6176680	6177180	all of that.
6178600	6185320	You know, you see these instances like kind of blocking the entirety of other instances
6185320	6189800	off and they kind of become their own insular community.
6190360	6197160	And you see the same thing with like, I don't know, you see, like you said, these subsets
6197160	6197800	of Twitter, right?
6197800	6199800	These subsets of Twitter communities.
6199800	6201880	Someone in the chat said James Damore.
6201880	6202520	That's who it was.
6202520	6203160	James Damore.
6205320	6213720	Yeah, so I think it's interesting that we have this in the IRL space, I guess is what
6213720	6214280	I would call it.
6215080	6220360	You have this increasing multiculturalism and it's good in a lot of ways, right?
6220360	6226680	And it's increasing a culture being exported to a lot of different places and being shared
6226680	6228200	with a lot of different places, right?
6229160	6234360	And then at this, but at the same time, you have like a loss of people feeling like they've
6234360	6236760	lost their individuality and their sense of community.
6236760	6241720	And I think that what's happening on the internet with the, like what you're saying, the balkanization
6241720	6244200	of the internet is kind of a response to that.
6244840	6253640	So people are kind of looking for a sense of identity online and through politics and
6253640	6260120	through their political identity online.
6260120	6262600	And I think that we can kind of see that happening.
6262600	6271400	Like you see how polarized people are in politics online, how people who should get along don't
6271400	6280440	get along, like how much socialists of different types will fight with each other and like
6280440	6281560	excommunicate each other.
6282200	6283000	Well, that's not new.
6283000	6285000	You can see that a hundred years ago, too.
6285000	6285880	Oh, really?
6285880	6287000	Oh, yeah, absolutely.
6287000	6291640	It just feels like things are, it does feel like politics is more polarized though, at
6291640	6293640	least in American society.
6293640	6298280	Maybe it's just in my brain, but it seems like that's the case.
6298360	6307800	And I think that might be a natural reaction to this loss of like what people think made
6307800	6309800	them individual, I guess.
6309800	6310840	I think that's part of it, yeah.
6311800	6315240	I mean, Richard Spencer said something that I think is probably correct in that video
6315240	6316440	you were watching yesterday.
6316440	6319240	And it's that America was always an empire.
6319240	6321000	It wasn't a nation state, right?
6321000	6327000	That's why you have states and not provinces because you have 50 states, 50 different types
6327080	6328440	of people who are all kind of different.
6330200	6332200	And you're all united under one federal government.
6333640	6335320	You're from India, so you definitely know this too.
6335320	6337880	Like the Indian government is a federal one because you have all these different types
6337880	6339080	of people under one government.
6341160	6342200	Canada is kind of the same.
6342200	6345640	We have provinces in Canada, so it's not quite the same, but like there's definitely a difference
6345640	6349480	between people on the East coast and the central Canada and the West coast, Ontario.
6349480	6352120	You have the French people in Quebec, like different kinds of people here.
6353000	6358520	Meanwhile, you look at Europe and in France, there's French people, right?
6358520	6359320	It's a nation state.
6360120	6361480	In Japan, there's Japanese people.
6361480	6363400	It's a state for a nation.
6363400	6365080	That's not how it is in the West.
6365080	6373240	So I think that basically because there's so many different types of people and we no
6373240	6382040	longer have an identity because having one is racist now because they're going to call
6382040	6385720	you white supremacists if you have any kind of identity, even if it's not a white one,
6385720	6387160	you could be like, oh, I'm proud to be American.
6387160	6388040	Oh, well that's being racist.
6388040	6388680	It's like, well, is it?
6388680	6389240	No, it's not.
6389240	6391080	But some progressives say that it is.
6391080	6397240	I think like once you strip away any sort of possible ethnic identity, whether it's
6397960	6401640	like a civic nationalist identity or an ethnic nationalist identity, some sort of identity
6401640	6403560	that revolves around your polity.
6403560	6409000	Once you strip that away, you're left with political groups, ideologies.
6409000	6410680	You're left with sports teams.
6410680	6412360	You're left with being a gamer or not.
6412360	6416120	You're left with all sorts of other things that can be destructive, right?
6418440	6421480	And I think Richard Spencer was right when he just talked about, he was saying stuff
6421480	6425480	about how like there's, oh man, have you watched any crowd videos yet?
6426840	6428760	I love crowd.
6431000	6432840	Have you seen his video?
6432840	6433800	It's an hour and a half long.
6433800	6435080	His video on realism.
6436120	6437560	No, I haven't seen it.
6437560	6439080	That is one of the best ones he has made.
6439080	6439720	You've got to watch it.
6439720	6440200	It's great.
6440920	6446680	But he spent some time talking about the crisis of modernity and the crisis of modernity.
6446680	6448280	Have you heard about that idea before?
6450040	6455720	I think I've heard it in vague terms, but I don't think I know what it means.
6456840	6462360	It's basically the idea that we have reached the limit of enlightenment thinking.
6462920	6466520	You know, the enlightenment came about because we realized, oh, we can use rationality to
6466520	6467080	figure out the world.
6467080	6469160	We're going to use science, the scientific method.
6469160	6470280	We're going to use history.
6470280	6471480	We're going to use languages.
6471480	6473960	We're going to use all of the, we're going to, we're not, we're not going to be like
6474600	6475720	emotional anymore.
6475720	6479640	We're not going to be basing things on honor anymore or on like family tribal structures.
6479640	6482200	We're going to be rationalistic about both society.
6482200	6482680	Right.
6482680	6488520	And, um, Hegel being a product of the enlightenment, he, he basically predicted
6488520	6492760	fascism like over a hundred years before it came about, because he said that the, the
6492760	6498520	ultimate rationalistic project would be the, would be the state as God on earth.
6499320	6502440	Since if you, if you're going to construct everything rationalistically, you're going
6502440	6506120	to plan everything out is going to require the ultimate state and the fascist fully
6506120	6506680	embraced that.
6507240	6511560	So, so fascism was kind of seen as like the natural end of enlightenment thinking.
6511560	6516440	Um, this is by the way, the main reason that like that, that, that reactionaries view
6516440	6521720	fascism as left wing, because they will say that liberalism, socialism, and fascism are
6521720	6523800	all products of the enlightenment.
6523800	6527240	And so they're on the left and they're thinking is pre enlightenment.
6527240	6530680	It's, it's like, it's feudalism, it's monarchy, it's from before the enlightenment.
6530680	6532520	So fascism is left wing to them.
6533080	6539720	But, but, but basically, um, we actually have reached the, the limits of rationalistic
6539720	6543160	thinking because we've discovered, um, what's it called?
6543720	6544040	Hold on.
6544040	6549720	Let me just, let me just real quick, uh, on, on that point though.
6549720	6552920	Um, okay.
6552920	6553640	I've got it.
6553640	6556360	Um, Godel's incompleteness theorems.
6556360	6561800	There are basically two things, uh, very tasking did a great video called, um, the hole
6561800	6562680	at the bottom of math.
6563400	6566520	The idea is basically that there are two things that we know to be true, but we can't
6566520	6567080	prove them.
6567080	6569080	It is impossible for human logic to prove them.
6570440	6575000	And we don't know why, but they are true and they're unprovable and they're like a
6575000	6578840	core component deep down in the most complicated parts of mathematics.
6578840	6581000	We just can't prove them true, but we know that they're true.
6581720	6584440	So it's like, well, you know, what do you, what do you do with that?
6584440	6589240	Um, we've learned similar things about, about science regarding like, we can't truly
6589240	6592920	know the position of, of an electron, right?
6593800	6595800	We know it's there, but we, but we don't know which way it's spinning.
6595800	6596680	We don't know which way it's rotating.
6596680	6598840	We don't like, there are just some things that we cannot know.
6599480	6605160	There's, there's a, there's a hard limit on what we can rationalistically, um, figure
6605160	6609720	out using human senses and using all of our, using all of our skills and all of our
6609720	6610120	abilities.
6610680	6618200	Um, and this is, this is basically the, you can read a lot of people who are anti-liberal
6618200	6621960	like, like a lot of the fascist writers, a lot of the socialist writers, a lot of, a
6621960	6626200	lot of these, these, these political theorists and they all independently come to the same
6626200	6627000	conclusion.
6627000	6631880	And that conclusion ultimately is that, um, ideology doesn't matter at all.
6632600	6637400	It's just, it's all just like a post hoc justification for uses of power.
6637400	6641160	So liberal socialists and fascists will all do the same thing, given the exact same
6641160	6643400	historical material conditions.
6643400	6648440	And they just use their ideologies to disguise their, their, to legitimize their use of
6648440	6648760	power.
6649720	6652520	And I don't believe that by the way, but that's how, that's how these people view it.
6652520	6656200	And, and they, they get to this point of view because it's a crisis.
6656200	6657240	It's like a crisis of meaning.
6657240	6661560	Basically, there's, there's nothing underneath any of it.
6662440	6667320	It sounds very nihilistic, but it's like, there's no foundation to any of our beliefs.
6667800	6669960	And so the bottom has fallen out.
6669960	6670920	There's no God.
6670920	6671720	God won't catch us.
6671720	6674280	Cause now we, we, you know, God is dead and he said, God is dead.
6674280	6675640	So there's, there's like, there's nothing.
6675640	6676680	And it's like, well, what do we do?
6676680	6678920	Oh, lots of people say it's all just power.
6678920	6681880	It's just political power at the end of the day and power is all that matters.
6682520	6685480	I don't believe that, but it's a very seductive argument.
6685480	6686520	Crote's video is very good on it.
6686520	6687640	You should, you should watch it for sure.
6689080	6690600	Sorry for the, sorry for the rant.
6690600	6690840	Sorry.
6691720	6693000	No, it's really interesting.
6693000	6694040	It's fascinating.
6694040	6698600	Um, uh, is that his most recent video critique?
6699720	6700760	A critique of realism.
6701960	6702120	Yeah.
6703480	6705000	Is that still the most recent video?
6705000	6705960	I think it is.
6705960	6706440	I think so.
6706440	6706760	Yeah.
6706760	6707480	Three weeks ago.
6708200	6708440	Yeah.
6710600	6717960	Um, uh, interesting that you say that cause, um, I remember also that conversation yesterday
6717960	6723560	that, that Spencer and, and destiny were having, having, and, and, uh, Spencer said
6723560	6730840	that like liberal, is it liberalism that he said was a, was a, was a donut.
6732120	6732440	Yes.
6732440	6734040	With nothing in the center.
6734040	6735720	He said liberalism's a donut.
6735720	6739400	It offers people nothing to actually hold on to because it has no prescriptions.
6740360	6741400	There's probably some truth to that.
6742040	6745400	If you think about it, I think, I think what he meant by that, it was something like,
6745400	6749960	it's something like, okay, maybe, maybe it's more libertarianism than liberalism,
6749960	6753720	but like definitely, you know, if you, you know, what, what is the argument for
6753720	6754920	decriminalizing pot?
6754920	6756600	Well, it doesn't hurt me if you're just doing it to yourself.
6756600	6757240	It doesn't matter.
6757240	6757880	Right.
6757880	6761560	That's a decent argument for a commonizing pot, but like, you can take that logic to
6761560	6762440	some pretty dark roads.
6762440	6765400	You can say it for like meth for heroin.
6765400	6767400	You see people destroying their lives in the streets.
6767400	6768440	Like, well, that's not good.
6768440	6768920	Right.
6768920	6769240	Yeah.
6769240	6776040	Um, I think what if all test at one point said that society is just a foundation that
6776120	6780040	we all agree to believe in, and then we build on top of that.
6780040	6783880	But if you don't have the same foundation, you can't, you can't really get along.
6783880	6784840	There's something like that.
6785400	6788760	It's like, well, we've agreed on this logic and we're going to guide ourselves by this
6788760	6789080	logic.
6789080	6790200	These are going to be our core rules.
6790200	6793800	And then from there we can have, you know, as long as we're all playing the same game,
6794520	6798360	we can, we can play the game and maybe I win sometimes, maybe you win sometimes we're all
6798360	6799320	playing the same game.
6799320	6802440	If you're outside the game and you're trying to destroy the game, it's a different type
6802440	6803400	of politics altogether.
6803400	6803880	Yeah.
6803880	6804760	You know what I mean?
6804760	6809000	So I think, I think that's what he was getting at is something like, I know Sargon wrote
6809000	6814600	the article, the asset of liberalism, where basically because liberalism has no prescriptions
6814600	6819480	and it like, and the progressives kind of morph all culture into like this unified gray
6819480	6823080	sludge that where no one's offended and nothing's really distinct anymore.
6823080	6826200	I've heard the gray sludge from Spencer before, actually.
6826200	6826680	Yeah.
6826680	6827560	Lots of people have said that.
6827560	6828040	Yeah.
6828040	6828200	Yeah.
6828520	6837480	It's just this, this, it's this idea that because, you know, if you talk to a liberal,
6837480	6839160	they'll say, well, freedom is our virtue.
6839160	6842760	And it's like, well, that's a pretty good virtue if you're oppressed, but what virtues
6842760	6845960	are there if you're not oppressed, if you don't eat, like you don't eat freedom anymore,
6845960	6849320	you know, you're you live in a, in a free society.
6849320	6850120	What do you do now?
6850840	6852280	Liberals don't seem to have an answer for that.
6852280	6854680	They don't have like a positive vision they can put forward of the world.
6854680	6856280	Well, it's like, well, you should do this.
6856840	6860520	Conservatives have that, which is why even though I like, I'm not really, I don't view
6860520	6861640	myself as a conservative.
6861640	6864760	I don't like a conservative politician, especially in, especially in America.
6864760	6865880	They're fucking insane.
6865880	6871240	But conservative political philosophy is very good because liberalism will, will liberate
6871240	6874760	you, but it won't tell you what to do with your liberation.
6874760	6879080	Conservatives will though conservatives will say, okay, well, maybe you should you know,
6879080	6884360	get married and have kids and, you know, work, work a decent job, provide for yourself, build
6884440	6886680	something of value to you and those around you.
6886680	6888920	It goes, they're all conservative prescriptions, right?
6888920	6890200	A liberal wouldn't tell you that stuff.
6892280	6892520	Yeah.
6895000	6899320	I, I, I think, I, I think I've, I've said this a few times.
6899320	6903320	It's like governments should be liberal and people should be conservative.
6904040	6905640	I think it's something like that.
6905640	6910520	I was talking to Dylan Burns and he, he took offense at how I worded it, but he ultimately
6910520	6911080	agreed with me.
6911320	6915160	I said, if you're, if you're talking to a young gay man who doesn't know what to do
6915160	6920760	with his life, would you tell him to get married to a partner and adopt some kids and be responsible
6920760	6925240	and have a family and, you know, be a pillar of your community, or would you, would you
6925240	6929560	go to the piss guzzling orgies and spread disease around what's better for you?
6929560	6931240	You know, you can do both of them.
6931240	6932840	You're free, but what's better for you?
6932840	6935240	Like clearly the first option is better than the second, right?
6936360	6936840	Yeah.
6937400	6937960	Yeah.
6937960	6944440	So I, I think, yeah, I think, I think you need like a dose of conservatism to go along
6944440	6946440	with your liberalism just to give you direction in life.
6947800	6949400	Yeah, I can agree with that.
6949960	6950920	I can agree with that.
6953400	6960120	Yeah, some of these, some of these, you know, ideas are definitely like above my head.
6961720	6963880	But they're definitely very interesting.
6964520	6968360	Kraut's video, man, you'll, I don't know if you want to watch it on stream or anything,
6968360	6970440	but it's, it's a really good video to watch.
6970440	6972440	He, he does it better than me.
6972440	6973000	That's for sure.
6975640	6978120	Some of your chat is like, anyone want to write an article in Mr.
6978120	6979640	Girl, Lav and Shaylin with me?
6980680	6984520	You know, I, I'm not in the destiny orbiter sphere.
6984520	6986680	I don't completely know what's going on.
6986680	6989240	What's the, what's the latest on Mr.
6989240	6990840	Girl and Lav and Shaylin?
6990840	6991720	Lav and Shaylin.
6992440	6995080	We had the call where I yelled at Shaylin.
6995080	6996040	She came in screaming.
6996040	6999240	And so I, I just like snapped and I started yelling at her and calling her.
6999240	7000120	Oh, that's right.
7000120	7000620	Yeah.
7002120	7004040	He told her to go be a sex doll.
7006440	7010680	Yeah, I went a little bit on hinge there, but like, I don't know what it is.
7010680	7015800	Like she came in screaming and her voice was just so grating on me.
7015800	7018840	And usually it takes me a lot to push me to the edge.
7018840	7027160	But that night, her coming in and screaming was, it was just, it just took me there.
7027160	7030440	I just started seeing red and I couldn't help myself.
7030440	7038520	And I started yelling at her and yeah, I just lost my cool, you know, hate to see it, but
7039560	7040520	I thought it was really funny.
7040520	7041400	I remember seeing that now.
7041400	7041640	Yeah.
7041640	7043320	I thought it was really funny.
7043320	7043880	Oh man.
7043960	7050600	There was, so, you know, I've always considered myself like kind of a, kind of a moderate
7050600	7053880	kind of a centrist, um, for a long time.
7053880	7055960	I called myself Senator left like eight years ago.
7055960	7059400	I don't, I no longer feel comfortable calling myself Senator left because the left's gone
7059400	7064120	fucking nuts, you know, and plus people who are, who are truly on the socialist left,
7064120	7065640	they think I'm a fascist anyway, so fuck it.
7065640	7067880	You know, I don't, I don't owe these people anything.
7067880	7073640	Um, but like I've seen some people in my chat or sorry, not in my chat, in, in my comments,
7073640	7075720	they're like devs turning leftward.
7075720	7078600	So he can, he can try to be the next destiny orbiter.
7078600	7082600	And I'm like, you know, I've, I've had the, the permission is to go into destiny stream
7082600	7083480	for like six months now.
7083480	7084680	And I haven't used them.
7084680	7089880	I can use them once, you know, and you know, I'm, I'm not as big as destiny, but I'm about
7089880	7091800	like 20% destiny size.
7091800	7095320	When I fire up a stream, I can get like maybe 500, maybe a thousand for a political stream.
7095320	7096440	It's not, it's not bad numbers.
7096440	7096920	Right.
7096920	7100600	So like, I don't, I don't need, I no offense to destiny.
7100600	7102520	He's not going to watch us, but no offense to him anyway.
7102520	7104280	But I don't, I don't like need the bump.
7104280	7105080	Does that make sense?
7107160	7110360	So there are people who are like, I can't believe you're trying to like, like, like
7110360	7111480	a court DGG.
7111480	7113400	I'm like, I'm not, I'm really not.
7113400	7117480	You don't need to be a left-winger to, you don't need to be a left-winger to be an orbiter
7117480	7117800	either.
7117800	7121720	I mean, like, uh, you know, I'm pretty sure that they're, you know, they're people who
7122360	7124520	don't align with him on stuff.
7124520	7129880	Um, I, I, I'm pretty sure like I kind of more identify as like a neoliberal, I think.
7130440	7135720	You know, I think, uh, I don't know what I identify as, but, um, but, you know, I think
7135720	7141000	there's like a communist chick, um, you know, there's, yeah, yeah, there's a communist chick
7141000	7142840	who, who joins the calls.
7143480	7150680	Um, you know, there are people of different political, um, different political, you know,
7150680	7152520	leanings, counterpoint is in there.
7152520	7152840	Right.
7152840	7154520	Cause he's, he's a conservative in there.
7154520	7154840	Yeah.
7154840	7155000	Yeah.
7155000	7157800	He's a conservative or he's center, right.
7157800	7158520	You know?
7158520	7160360	So, yeah.
7161240	7164040	Um, isn't ABBA also kind of conservative too?
7164680	7168600	He strikes ABBA is, I think he's more apolitical.
7168600	7173240	Um, yeah, maybe, maybe.
7175240	7180120	But yeah, sometimes like I, sometimes I get a bit tired of just the constant drama that
7180120	7182520	comes into that community, but sometimes it's fun to watch.
7182520	7184440	Sometimes it's fun to watch just a good show.
7185960	7186200	Yeah.
7187000	7187240	Yeah.
7188840	7192520	Um, Destiny even said Connor was his star opposition right now.
7192520	7193080	That's fake.
7193080	7193560	Is that true?
7194360	7202280	Oh, I, uh, I, I haven't like, maybe this is, I don't know how I want to word this carefully.
7203880	7207800	I wouldn't mind talking to Connor, but one, I don't know if you want to talk to me and
7207800	7209160	two, I don't know what we talk about.
7211000	7211560	I'm not sure.
7212760	7213800	He's a really cool guy.
7213800	7215480	I get along with him really well.
7215480	7219480	Um, yeah, yeah.
7219480	7220760	He's very, very cool.
7220760	7222760	Um, uh, you'd probably get along with him.
7223400	7223560	Yeah.
7223560	7224440	But yeah, I don't know.
7224440	7225880	I don't know what you guys would talk about.
7227720	7227880	Yeah.
7227880	7228600	I don't, I don't know.
7228600	7229720	I don't know either.
7229720	7233160	Um, was there any more gamer gate stuff to talk about?
7234280	7238600	There probably is, but I'm probably going to have to like, look and read more on it
7238600	7240360	and then come back at you with stuff.
7241000	7241640	Yeah.
7241640	7241960	Yeah.
7242600	7243400	There's so much.
7244360	7245640	Who was, oh God.
7245640	7245800	Yeah.
7245800	7248360	There's so many old names that I just remember now.
7248360	7250200	You know, like there's this person is Margaret.
7250200	7251400	Plus who is Margaret plus?
7252680	7253080	Oh yeah.
7253080	7253640	Some nutter.
7257640	7258600	Alistair Pinsoff.
7258600	7259400	Oh fuck that.
7259400	7260600	Oh, hold on.
7260600	7261960	I almost remembered who that was.
7267080	7269640	Somebody says, talk the Anita Sarkeesian edge.
7271400	7272280	Anita Sarkeesian.
7273480	7274280	Talk the Anita.
7274280	7276280	What do you mean by the Anita Sarkeesian edge?
7276920	7277160	Yeah.
7277160	7278200	I don't know what that means.
7280520	7280760	Um,
7284120	7285720	Oh no, uh, Alistair Pinsoff.
7285720	7291880	He was like, uh, he was, he was, um, he was part of, uh, was it destructoid?
7291880	7292120	Yeah.
7292680	7295960	There was only one gaming outlet that was pro gamer gate at the time.
7295960	7298840	And that was, um, that was the escapist.
7299400	7306440	And they got, like, they got fucking cut off from everyone because of their pro gamer gate stance.
7306440	7306840	That's right.
7306840	7307160	Yeah.
7307160	7311720	February 13, a movie, Bob was fired from the escapist.
7313080	7313560	Wow.
7314440	7319080	Um, what have you been thinking about all the Islam stuff recently?
7320440	7323000	Oh, like all the destiny shit posting about Islam.
7324200	7325080	I mean, it's funny.
7325080	7325560	Right.
7326040	7326920	I mean, it's funny.
7326920	7327480	Right.
7327480	7331720	But I mean, I remember like duking it out with Muslims 10 years ago and it was the same stuff,
7331720	7336200	like death threats constantly, just, you know, claims of being Islamophobic.
7337160	7341080	It's like, when I first came onto the internet, the first people I ended up in,
7341080	7344040	like interacting and arguing with were like funding Muslims.
7344840	7349880	Half of them were funding Muslims and half of them were like, uh, super far right people.
7349880	7354600	Um, and they were kind of, they kind of interacted with each other a lot
7354600	7359240	and they hated each other, even though most of the views that they had were very similar.
7359240	7362120	So, um, yeah.
7362120	7362360	Yeah.
7363000	7369480	Well, I mean, I remember 10 years ago, you know, conservatives would not like the comparison with
7369480	7372520	Sharia law, presumably because of, you know, the war on terror.
7372520	7374520	And now they're like, oh, it's pretty based actually.
7374520	7375320	It's like, yeah, guys.
7375320	7375800	Yeah.
7379480	7379800	Yeah.
7379800	7381880	The, um, oh yeah.
7381880	7384440	Ethan Ralph got started in gamer gate too.
7384440	7385080	Did you know that?
7385640	7386680	Yeah, I didn't know that.
7386680	7386920	Yeah.
7387480	7391480	He, he wrote, he, he wrote some articles right on it.
7391480	7392520	That's how we got started.
7393560	7393800	Yep.
7393800	7396040	He and I were friends at one point, way back in the day.
7397960	7399640	He like, you're still cool.
7400200	7405160	Kind of, but hold on away from, I'm trying to stay away from that.
7405720	7409560	Um, didn't he like get your channel blasted off the internet?
7410360	7411880	I don't know who was him specifically,
7411880	7415720	but it was definitely like one of his super fans that had it happen.
7417240	7423400	There are old logs of Ralph participating in getting channels taken down during gamer gate.
7423400	7424840	So like, I would not be surprised.
7424840	7426280	He's always done this shit.
7426280	7428440	He's like, he's always done this shit.
7429320	7429560	Yeah.
7432440	7434200	I mean, I still think he's an interesting guy.
7434840	7436600	Oh, for sure.
7436600	7436840	Yeah.
7436840	7438040	He's really funny.
7438040	7439480	He's always got something going on.
7440120	7440760	He's very funny.
7440760	7442280	He's a great entertainer.
7442280	7443480	He's an excellent entertainer.
7443480	7446360	Say what you will about him, but he knows how to entertain an audience.
7448280	7453640	To the point where even his hate watchers like are tuning in because they're entertained by the guy.
7453640	7457240	Um, I mean, yeah.
7457880	7458120	Yeah.
7458120	7458920	Here's the thing though.
7458920	7461880	Like he, he got Sargon banned off Patreon.
7461880	7465240	He helped get crowd ban banned off the internet for a while.
7465240	7467640	Like he's, he's fucked over.
7467640	7471880	Like every he he's, he's rather apolitical when it comes to who he fucks over.
7471880	7473640	He fucks over everyone all the time.
7474520	7476680	You know, if he can do it, he will.
7478440	7482280	So I'm actually just going to see real quick.
7482840	7484120	Where does this timeline end?
7488920	7489960	Oh, 2022.
7489960	7490440	That's right.
7490680	7494200	David de Pape attacks Paul Pelosi with a hammer.
7494200	7496760	He describes himself as radicalized by gamer gate.
7497800	7498280	Jesus.
7499400	7499960	Yeah.
7499960	7500440	Wow.
7501240	7502120	Fucking hell, man.
7505400	7511320	Yeah, I see 2021 January brand new states in the aftermath of 2021 United States Capitol attack that.
7512440	7518600	Everything I tried to get the FBI to act on in the aftermath of gamer gate has now come true.
7519560	7523400	We told people that have social media companies like Facebook and Reddit did not tighten their
7523400	7528360	policies about these communities organized hate that we are going to see violent insurrection
7528360	7529720	in the United States.
7529720	7533240	We told people that these communities were organizing online for violence and extremism
7534200	7536760	that unfortunately has proven to be true.
7541240	7541800	Interesting.
7544360	7544860	Yep.
7545660	7549500	Tech rafter describes gamer gate as an insane alt-right hate group.
7550620	7551100	I don't know.
7553500	7559500	It seems like gamer gate was had so many moving parts.
7559500	7562220	It's not accurate to call it a group of any type.
7562860	7564140	Yeah, yeah.
7564140	7568620	There was definitely people from all across the political spectrum that were engaged in it.
7568620	7570220	There were definitely some harassers.
7570220	7573420	There were definitely some people who were just looking to make a name for themselves.
7574380	7577020	There were people, there were there were right-leaning people who just wanted to
7577020	7578300	fuck with the feminists.
7578300	7582460	They were left-leaning people who saw this as a stab in the back from progressives who
7582460	7585580	should have had their back, but those progressives ended up being corrupt.
7585580	7588540	So like there, it was all sorts of things all at once.
7588540	7589040	Yeah.
7591100	7592220	Who is this editor of tech?
7592220	7592380	Yeah.
7592380	7595420	Tech rafter was very pro gamer gate back in the day.
7595980	7597900	And they've always been like pretty chill.
7597900	7602060	I wonder if they, if they had a new editor that like, or like if they just change their views.
7604220	7608700	Oh, it says here, tech rafter announces a complete removal of all gamer gate articles,
7608700	7612220	citing that they violated journalistic ethic of do no harm
7612220	7613980	by writing the articles in the first place.
7613980	7614460	Wow.
7614460	7615100	What the fuck?
7615660	7615900	Yeah.
7615900	7617980	I'm not sure that's a journalistic ethics thing.
7617980	7619180	Articles do harm all the time.
7619180	7619820	It just depends.
7620460	7621180	Yeah.
7621180	7622220	And it's going to sound strange.
7622780	7625820	It's going to sound strange, but like harm isn't,
7625820	7627580	sometimes isn't the most important thing, you know?
7628380	7628880	Yeah.
7629840	7630080	Yeah.
7630080	7631200	Maybe tech rafters got in.
7631200	7635680	Cause like, I remember talking to the editor of tech rafter back then,
7635680	7637920	and he was a really chill person.
7637920	7640080	I mean, you know, editors change out all the time, right?
7640080	7641120	Like people who run sites.
7642000	7642560	So who knows?
7642560	7643680	Maybe they just go in a new direction.
7644400	7646400	That's that's, that's their business, I guess.
7647680	7648400	Hmm.
7648400	7654720	Um, I, there was something on my mind, but I can't remember what it was.
7656640	7658080	Oh yeah, that's right.
7658080	7663040	I did a video on this fucking Mercedes Carrera ended up sexually abusing her daughter.
7664000	7664640	Fuck.
7664640	7665680	Yikes.
7665680	7667440	Oh, that's so disgusting.
7667440	7669520	Do you know who Mercedes Carrera is?
7669520	7672160	I don't know who that is, but so disgusting.
7672160	7675360	She's a porn star who got in on the whole gamer gate thing.
7676160	7678880	And she, she was talking about it back in 2014.
7679600	7685120	And, um, basically it came out in 2019
7686080	7687680	that she had been molesting her daughter.
7689200	7691600	Ew, that's so gross.
7691600	7692800	Yeah, she's still behind bars.
7694000	7695440	She probably will be for a very long time.
7696320	7697760	Yeah, I hope she's there for life.
7698480	7702560	Something like, I must admit, I have watched her porn.
7702560	7705760	So something changed between 2014 and 2019.
7706480	7710560	Like she was clearly beginning to use drugs or something because something changed radically
7710560	7713520	in how she looked and it wasn't just aging, you know?
7714000	7718000	She always kind of had like that Latina MILF thing going on because she's like, she's tall.
7718000	7719840	She's, she's very wide hipped.
7719840	7721440	So she, she had like a niche in porn.
7722640	7725840	And in 2014, she was really like making money off that niche for sure.
7725840	7730640	But by 2019, like something had radically changed about, about like the way her face
7730640	7734960	looked the way her body looked like, like she would, she, she was using drugs or something.
7735680	7742320	Cause yeah, drugs don't make you don't make you feel.
7742320	7743760	I know drugs don't make you a pedo.
7743760	7744160	I know that.
7744160	7750800	I know that chat, but like she had gone down some kind of rabbit hole for sure.
7754800	7755440	Yeah.
7755440	7756000	Oh man.
7756000	7759600	I'm trying to remember what it was that I was going to bring up, but I can't remember.
7761840	7765120	I mean, I can always bring it up at another time, I guess.
7765120	7769360	Was it about, was it about harm not being the most important thing sometimes?
7769760	7772160	No, it was something before that, I think.
7772800	7773360	Oh, okay.
7773920	7776800	Yeah, but that's okay.
7776800	7778480	Um, thank you for doing this with me.
7778480	7780720	It was super informative.
7780720	7781520	Yeah, no problem.
7781520	7782720	Are you coming to the end of it?
7784880	7790160	Uh, I actually was scrolling in reverse, but yeah, I saw the end of it.
7790160	7791360	Um, no, no.
7791360	7794160	I meant, are you coming to the end of, of, of our talk?
7794160	7798720	Cause I think, I think I'm, yeah, cause I think I'm, I'm at the end of it's, it's not
7798800	7800320	it's, it's nearly 10 o'clock for me.
7800320	7805680	So I probably have to, uh, I think we've talked as much as we can in one sitting
7805680	7809520	about gamer gate, you know, but I learned a lot for sure.
7809520	7814000	So, um, I really appreciate you, um, coming on and telling me
7814000	7815200	everything that you know about it.
7816080	7816480	Oh yeah.
7816480	7817120	No, no problem.
7817120	7817680	Of course.
7817680	7818160	Anytime.
7818160	7820800	And I'll definitely have to check out your videos on it too.
7820800	7821200	Oh God.
7821200	7822240	They're so old, man.
7824400	7825840	2014.
7825840	7826960	It's so bad.
7827680	7829120	No, I'm sure it's fine.
7829120	7833840	It's good to know like the context and kind of get into that space and get into that.
7833840	7838960	Um, you know, like what the internet was like back then, you know, um, if you're
7838960	7841520	really trying to get into, like understand it.
7841520	7846640	So pretending that, pretending that you're, you're in 2014 again, you know?
7846640	7846880	Yeah.
7846880	7847520	Pretty much.
7847520	7847760	Yeah.
7850000	7851760	Were you, were you online back in 2014?
7853600	7854800	2014.
7854800	7860320	Um, I think I was, I think I was a workaholic back in 2014.
7860320	7862560	I didn't see any friends and I only worked.
7862560	7869840	So I didn't, I, there are whole like years of my life where I just spent, uh, working
7869840	7875920	myself to the bone and, uh, and didn't partake in any recreational activities.
7875920	7877760	So I think that was probably back then.
7878320	7880240	When did you, when did you start YouTubing anyway?
7882320	7884480	Maybe like two years ago or something like that.
7884480	7884720	Okay.
7885520	7888080	Was it one of those things where you started it up because of the pandemic?
7888080	7889200	Like you had free time now.
7889200	7892080	So yeah, yeah, it was kind of one of those things.
7892080	7897680	And then it ended up taking off because, um, well, I'd always been streaming, but
7897680	7902640	the, you know, the, the streaming really took off when I started doing like going
7902640	7905600	on political panels and things like that.
7905600	7907760	And, um, I just kind of kept up with it.
7908400	7912880	Um, which is weird because I don't think I'm particularly the smartest person in
7912880	7913840	the world.
7913840	7919040	Um, I don't think that, um, my takes on politics are particularly like
7919680	7923280	groundbreaking or anything like that, but people liked what I had to say.
7923280	7927680	So, um, it just kind of took off and I just kept doing it.
7928400	7929200	But yeah.
7929200	7934720	Um, prior to that, I was like complete workaholic.
7934720	7937440	I was like the type of person that I was such a workaholic.
7937440	7941200	I made everybody else in the company, like look bad or made everybody else that
7941200	7942560	worked with me look bad.
7942640	7944720	People hated me for it.
7944720	7950800	Um, so, uh, and I had, I, I would, I stopped hanging out with friends.
7950800	7952400	Cause I was like, I don't know.
7952400	7953360	I have a problem.
7953360	7955680	Um, I saw, you know, I wouldn't hang out with friends.
7955680	7957200	I didn't do anything recreational.
7957200	7961440	I would just like work, come home and sleep and then wake up and go work again.
7961440	7964000	So it was, yeah.
7965200	7970720	With me, I man, I've, I've always joked that I've, I've consistently almost had
7970720	7975200	a YouTube career because I've known so many, like I knew JonTron before he was
7975200	7979920	big and that's a, that's a whole fucking long story, but like, I knew him before
7979920	7980480	he was big.
7980480	7981520	I lost contact.
7981520	7985440	I regained contact through Sargon because Sargon and JonTron are friends.
7985440	7988240	And that was kind of like a weird, Hey, it's been like 10 fucking years.
7988240	7989440	How have you been dude?
7989440	7991040	So that was like a weird situation.
7991040	7998160	Um, there's like a bunch of YouTubers that are, that are pretty big names.
7998800	8002240	You know, we're, we're talking like over a million subs for sure that have like
8002240	8004880	private messaged me and had been like, Hey, yeah, I secretly watch you.
8004880	8007440	Don't tell anyone because I don't want to get canceled, but you know, I watch you
8007440	8010640	and I watch Sargon and it's like, well, that's actually kinda, that's cool.
8010640	8011200	That's cool.
8011200	8018240	Um, and like, I had the idea to do some sort of internet content like a year and
8018240	8023280	a half before I started and this, and we started in 2009, so a long time ago,
8023280	8026720	completely different internet back then, completely different, everything back
8027680	8028240	then.
8028240	8032320	And I've always been like, just a few months behind every trend.
8032960	8036400	I've always like known people before they got big and then lost contact.
8036400	8039440	And it was like, like, it was hard to re to like reconnect with them.
8039440	8041040	I lost contact with Sargon for awhile.
8041040	8043520	I re-became his friend in like 2017 or something.
8044080	8048400	Um, you know, I, I knew shoe on head back in the day.
8048400	8053440	Like just, I, I I've, I've always been like on the periphery of people who have
8053440	8056560	blown up and I haven't, I've never really blown up myself.
8057520	8061840	You know, Sargon gave me a shout out and I got like three, uh, 30,000 subs from it.
8061840	8062720	That was pretty good.
8062720	8064320	I got another 30,000 from gamer gate.
8064320	8065440	That was pretty good.
8065440	8069440	But for like, for the most part, it's just been like a long, slow grind.
8071280	8074800	I kind of anticipate it's going to be a long slow grind for me as well.
8074800	8081280	So, um, unless you want, unless you, unless you really want to milk that DGG
8081280	8082240	connection.
8082240	8082480	Yeah.
8083200	8083920	I don't know.
8083920	8088480	Like, uh, like I feel guilty doing it, but like, there's not a time that would
8088480	8092480	be more relevant than right now while he's doing the whole anti Muslim arc,
8092480	8093200	you know?
8093200	8097920	Um, but, uh, you know, I, I kind of feel guilty.
8097920	8106000	I wish I had like the, uh, blatant, I don't know, like, uh, um,
8108320	8111600	there's some people who are just like really good at just milking it.
8111600	8113280	And I'm just not one of those people.
8113280	8119840	Um, but right now, everything that's happening is like super relevant to the
8119840	8121920	things that I think about in my head.
8121920	8124800	And also I was doing okay.
8124800	8126640	I, I talked to Spencer first.
8126640	8127120	Okay.
8127120	8128240	Before Destiny did.
8128240	8128960	Okay.
8128960	8132320	Uh, you know, and I don't see him getting the same amount of shit.
8132320	8132960	All right.
8132960	8133920	That's all I'm saying.
8134480	8136960	Yeah, that was, I, I saw that was pretty bullshit.
8136960	8139760	Like the amount of the amount that mind waves went after you for that.
8139760	8141760	And then just doesn't say a thing to destiny.
8142400	8143120	Yeah.
8143120	8145360	I've told you my opinion on that in private though already.
8145360	8145840	Yeah.
8145840	8146400	Yeah.
8146400	8151360	And then, and then, you know, then the, the, uh, you know, obviously the whole
8151360	8157200	anti-Islam arc is like, okay, I just debated some Muslims like a few days ago.
8157200	8162480	And now the whole anti-Islam arc that is happening, like, man, everything is so
8162480	8168400	relevant right now, but when I get onto a stream with the, with the dude, like he is
8168400	8169840	so bad at conversation.
8170640	8177200	So, uh, Oh, someone in your chest says it's because mind waves wants to kiss
8177200	8178480	destiny on the lips.
8179440	8180240	Yeah, probably.
8180240	8180880	Yeah.
8180880	8183280	He doesn't want to lose that DGG connection.
8183280	8183840	Yeah.
8183840	8184560	Yeah.
8184560	8189200	I'm very grateful for the connection, but yeah, it's like, I, I only want to jump
8189200	8191360	onto a stream if I really have something to say.
8191360	8193840	And then most of the time when I have something to say, there's already like
8193840	8196240	five people on, so I can't get a word in.
8196240	8199520	And then when I, when I do have something to say and there aren't five
8199520	8203360	people on, I come on and they say something and then that's it.
8204320	8204640	Yeah.
8204640	8205040	Yeah.
8205680	8207920	I fucking hate panels for that reason.
8207920	8210560	Like you never really, like you never really discussed the idea.
8210560	8211360	You never really drill down.
8211360	8214720	It's everyone, like everyone gives their surface level takes and everyone like
8214720	8216640	go round Robins a bit.
8216640	8220480	Maybe there's some drama where two people fight, but like, you don't really
8220480	8221760	discuss an idea.
8221760	8223280	Not really on a panel.
8223840	8225040	It's kind of why, why I hate him.
8225040	8226160	Like at some point, man.
8227200	8227440	Okay.
8227440	8230160	So I have, I have two videos coming up that you might like.
8230160	8231920	And one of them, one of them is the Gramsci video.
8231920	8237040	The other one is, was fascism actually capitalism and decay?
8237680	8243040	Because the answer to that is like 90% no, and leftists love to say that they'd
8243040	8243600	love to say that.
8243600	8248960	And it's, it's just not true, but like that's just a result of reading and
8248960	8251520	reading and reading and reading and reading and understanding some of these
8251520	8254880	ideas, but I could never find anybody who actually, who would actually debate
8254880	8255200	that.
8255200	8255360	Right.
8255360	8258880	Like I've, I've heard like Lance from the surf say that like 80 times.
8258880	8261120	I don't think he would ever talk to me his entire life.
8261120	8263920	You know, Xander hall ducked out of a debate with me.
8263920	8269760	So there's just like the part of the reason why I make the videos in the style
8269760	8275680	that I make them is because I've like, I've like learned the socialist position
8275680	8276720	on a lot of these things.
8277680	8281040	And it's like, well, I know how to counter this and I'm never going to talk to
8281040	8282800	them because they fucking hate me.
8282800	8284560	So I'll just make like a long ass video about it.
8284560	8288400	You know, I'll just do like a, I'll just do a deep dive and I'll reference like
8288400	8290160	books instead because fuck it.
8291600	8291840	Yeah.
8296400	8303600	Um, I think we've reached, I think we've like milked this as much as we can.
8304320	8305200	I think so too.
8305840	8306560	I think so too.
8306560	8307600	But it was super fun.
8307600	8308960	We should do this again soon.
8308960	8311680	Like in the next few days.
8311680	8314080	I mean, I'm, you see me in your chat a fair amount.
8314080	8318480	So like, you know, when I'm around, I, I don't know if you prefer scheduling
8318480	8319200	things or not.
8320000	8321040	It doesn't matter to me.
8321040	8323920	Like if you want to just have like a random hour to talk, I'll pop in for a
8323920	8324080	bit.
8324080	8325760	That's okay with me if you want.
8325760	8331280	Cause I'm usually around things cause I'm super disorganized, but you know,
8331280	8332320	but yeah.
8333760	8334800	Yeah, we'll figure it out.
8334800	8338720	You know, I'm also not against doing things like impromptu as well.
8339520	8343120	It's just good for me to schedule things cause I'll forget otherwise.
8343120	8344080	So yeah.
8344800	8345040	Okay.
8345040	8350480	Well, if you, if you, if you actually want my videos, the playlist on my
8350480	8353520	channel, the playlist on my channel is called indefensible.
8353520	8357680	The first like 10 videos or so are gamer gate related past that it's just like
8357680	8362160	other gaming topics because it's just like, as, as time went on, I started
8362160	8364000	doing other gaming videos and I just put them in the same place.
8364000	8365040	It's all gaming related.
8365040	8366800	It's not like philosophy related.
8366800	8372000	So indefensible is the, indefensible is, is the playlist.
8372640	8373440	Yeah.
8373440	8376160	I mean the pun is indefensible, but it's indie.
8377680	8378240	Yeah.
8378240	8378800	Yeah.
8378800	8382320	So like that's my playlist, just some ancient ass videos on there.
8382880	8386480	Um, uh, that's right.
8386480	8388400	The, the, uh, fucking word.
8388400	8388800	Where is it?
8388800	8389120	Where is it?
8389120	8390000	Where is it?
8390000	8390560	Yeah.
8390560	8395600	The know your meme page on gamer gate on Zoe Quinn on, on like the principal
8395600	8400560	players know your meme is really good for like documenting lots of old lore.
8400560	8401600	They're a great resource.
8402160	8406240	So if you want to see like the pro the explicitly pro gamer gate position,
8406240	8409040	know your meme has it, they have like their timeline.
8410320	8416480	Um, and I guess otherwise like try to dig up old internet aristocrat gamer gate
8416480	8419760	videos, they're going to be on like a gym archive channel somewhere.
8419760	8421440	You know, his stuff.
8421440	8423280	I don't think I can watch a gym.
8423280	8428240	I don't think I can watch gym on like, like, uh, on stream.
8428240	8432880	I think it might be, he's, he uses a lot of slurs with me, at least his recent stuff.
8432880	8435440	He, I know that he uses a lot of slurs.
8435440	8438240	So yeah, I think he did back then too.
8438240	8438740	Yeah.
8440080	8441120	But good resource.
8441120	8441920	Good resource.
8441920	8448960	Um, and yeah, I guess, uh, unrelated to gamer gate, you know, Croats realism video.
8448960	8449600	Got to watch that.
8449600	8450560	It's great.
8450560	8452880	And I think, I think I recommended to you last time.
8452880	8454000	Uh, what if alt hissed?
8454640	8457120	He does great videos in the same style of crowd.
8457760	8459680	What is alt hissed?
8459680	8460080	Okay.
8460080	8460580	Yeah.
8460880	8469200	He's he's, he's also a conservative, but he's, um, he's not that he's not biased.
8469200	8470720	Also, he dumpstered Vosh in a debate.
8470720	8471680	It was fucking hilarious.
8473680	8474480	Take a look at this.
8474480	8475120	Yeah.
8475120	8480800	Uh, uh, uh, there was, uh, that's, he reacted to it where basically Vosh said,
8480800	8484720	well, can you describe Simone de Beauvoir her, her writing?
8484720	8485680	He's like, oh yeah, of course he does.
8485680	8488240	He starts launching into it and Vosh is like, uh, oh sure.
8489120	8492240	Like he, it was fucking, do you remember seeing that?
8492240	8494000	That's I don't remember seeing that.
8494000	8494500	Okay.
8495040	8499520	It was like, basically Vosh was trying to like out intellect him and he knew exactly
8499520	8504400	what the writing was and Vosh just like chose a random name and it did not fucking play
8504400	8505280	out well for him.
8506080	8508240	It sounds so similar to somebody we know.
8508240	8511760	Um, I wonder where president Sunday got his mannerisms.
8511760	8512320	Oh fuck.
8512320	8513120	Oh fuck.
8513120	8517200	Um, what, yeah, what if all test he's, he has his problems, but he's like, he's a good
8517200	8517760	center, right.
8517760	8521840	Resource when it comes to like history and philosophy, just, just, just, just, just
8521840	8524000	remember his bias, but he's still pretty good.
8524000	8524640	Yeah.
8524640	8525140	Yeah.
8525600	8525920	Yeah.
8525920	8526160	Yeah.
8526160	8529600	I think I'm going to have to do more reading on like some of these like social issues.
8529600	8536240	Cause I clearly don't have the vocabulary to like, to like vocalize what I'm observing
8536240	8536960	half the time.
8536960	8542400	I feel, but, um, yeah, I can't, I can't feel that that way sometimes too.
8542400	8544880	That way you're way better than I am.
8545440	8545920	You think so?
8546560	8547280	Yeah, I think so.
8547280	8548800	You've got all the reading.
8548800	8552880	I, yeah, but I stutter and stumble over everything and I can't like, I can talk on a script
8552880	8554800	decently, but I can't, I can't do streams.
8554800	8557920	It seems sometimes I'm always just like stuttering and like, what do I mean?
8557920	8558400	Oh, fuck.
8559520	8559840	Yeah.
8559840	8560720	I think you're really great.
8560720	8566160	I, I, I, for me, it's like, I don't even have the vocabulary to even like, when I'm talking
8566160	8571200	about these things feel like they're kind of theoretical or something, or they feel
8571200	8572800	like they're kind of abstract.
8572800	8578480	And, um, and I just don't have, I don't have the vocabulary to accurately explain them
8578480	8579040	fully.
8579040	8585840	Um, like when we were talking about like, you know, individualism versus like, you know,
8585840	8590560	this multiculturalist like world, you know, um, and things like that.
8590560	8596000	Like, I don't know, these feel like things that I struggle for words, uh, with when I'm
8596000	8602240	trying to describe them, but I don't know, maybe I just don't have enough like words
8602240	8604000	in my vocabulary or something.
8605520	8606480	I, I can sit with this.
8606480	8608160	I feel that way about myself a lot too.
8609360	8611600	Um, okay.
8611600	8613200	I think, I think that's about it though.
8613200	8616080	So if you want to talk again, we can talk again.
8616080	8616960	I'm usually around.
8616960	8619040	It's not hard to, it's not hard to get ahold of me.
8619840	8620080	Yeah.
8620080	8623840	Let me, um, let me do some more diving into the gamer gate stuff and then I'll hit you
8623840	8625600	up about like talking again.
8626400	8626960	Sure.
8626960	8627360	Sure.
8627360	8627920	Yeah.
8627920	8629360	Maybe we can go through like that.
8629920	8634240	You know, I think it's, I think it's super useful for me, like to go through the thing
8634240	8638880	that's slanted against gamer gate, since you're, you seem like you're pretty pro gamer gate.
8638880	8639520	Yeah, I was.
8639520	8639840	Yeah.
8639840	8640880	And yeah.
8640880	8644880	And then maybe I can do the same thing with like somebody who is anti gamer gate and like
8644880	8648800	go through something that's pro gamer, like a pro gamer gate timeline with somebody who's
8648800	8649520	anti gamer gate.
8649520	8650320	That would be kind of cool.
8651280	8654000	I mean, you could probably, maybe Brandon would do it with you.
8654000	8654400	I don't know.
8655520	8655680	Yeah.
8655680	8660880	I don't know how many she, she would do, you know, I don't know how many, um, how many
8662000	8663920	like sessions she would do with me, you know?
8663920	8664240	Yeah.
8664240	8665840	I don't know if that's fun for other people.
8665840	8667600	I know it's fun for me, but you know.
8669040	8669280	Yeah.
8670800	8672320	Uh, but yeah, I'll, I'll be around.
8672320	8674480	It's not hard to figure out where I am.
8674480	8677120	So yeah, I'll see you next time.
8677120	8677360	Okay.
8678000	8678960	See you next time.
8678960	8680400	Thanks for joining Dev.

8685440	8687040	I'm going to be real with you, SFO.
8687040	8695040	I looked up mold bug and, um, and I was like, bro, some of the stuff that this dude is saying
8695040	8696160	is a little bit based.
