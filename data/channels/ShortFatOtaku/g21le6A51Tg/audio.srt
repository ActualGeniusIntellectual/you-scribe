1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Hello?

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,900
Hello, how's it going?

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,800
Hey, how's it going?

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,400
Pretty good.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,300
I'm just really busy.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:10,800
Hold on.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,800
I just got a stretch.

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,500
Okay, what's going on?

9
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Hey, your camera on Discord looks really different than your

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,000
camera on the stream.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,400
What happened?

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,100
Yeah, I fucked it up.

13
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,400
Sorry.

14
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Give me a second here.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,800
Hello, welcome to the stream.

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,900
How are you doing?

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,300
Very good.

18
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,300
Very well.

19
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,300
I've just been I've been doing a lot of writing and reading.

20
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,000
My next project is on Antonio Gramsci.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,600
So I mean, it's you can't read the entire prison notebooks

22
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,100
in, you know, two days.

23
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,200
It's like a 500 page book, but

24
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,000
I don't know if you know who who's is it socked on left

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
soaked on left.

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,700
Yeah, he's kind of an idiot a lot of the time.

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,300
I don't know if you agree with me.

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,100
I don't know enough about the stuff he talks about that

29
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,800
really knows.

30
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,400
Okay.

31
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,600
Now he made some some of these stupid claims about

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,800
Antonio Gramsci like a week ago and I've been putting off

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,100
doing my video on the prison notebooks for about six months

34
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,800
mainly at a laziness and I was like, you know what it's it's

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,900
kind of time to talk about it.

36
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,700
I think because you know who Gramsci is?

37
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,500
Yeah, I do.

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:31,800
Yeah.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,400
Okay, you know that a lot of right oids on the internet tend

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,700
to misquote him.

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,200
Do you know what that I don't know about that?

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,500
No.

43
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,500
So there's a very famous Gramsci quote floating around

45
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,000
it turns out it's actually not from Gramsci and the entire

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,900
right wing ecosystem is kind of built off this quote.

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,700
However, even though Gramsci didn't say the quote he said

48
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,800
stuff in his writing that is enough like it that it's pretty

49
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,700
much accurate.

50
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,400
So I'm gonna go over what he what he said what soaked and

51
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,900
left said was correct and also and but and ultimately where

52
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,500
he's wrong.

53
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,500
So that's that's a big project that I'm working on right

54
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:12,700
now.

55
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,900
Yeah, sounds like it sounds like it and that'll be that'll

56
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,800
be out probably next week or so very cool.

57
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,000
I mean you've watched my videos now you notice that like

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,400
some of them just have like the the fat laughing dev background.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,200
Those are like my less serious videos.

60
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,400
And then the more serious ones are more edited like the

61
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,600
three forms of fascism.

62
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,300
This one's going to be a more edited one.

63
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,800
So that's cool.

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,200
Yeah, your forms of fascism one was really good.

65
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
So yeah, I get a lot of compliments on it.

66
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,100
There are people who really didn't like it because they

67
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,900
thought the idea of libertarian fascism is stupid.

68
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,700
It is a stupid idea, but people do believe it, you know people

69
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,100
believe a lot in a lot of stupid ideas.

70
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,100
Yeah, for sure.

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,900
Well post me post that I'm talking to you somewhere.

72
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,600
Give me a second.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,200
Yeah.

74
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,500
Yeah.

75
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:01,800
Yeah.

76
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,600
We're here to talk about gamergate chat educate me on

77
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,300
gamergate.

78
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,500
Now.

79
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
I've already looked at some of the stuff around it.

80
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,100
Oh my God.

81
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,700
Why do I have Nikkato avocados ass on my on my God, Jesus

82
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,100
Christ.

83
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,500
I did some reading about it.

84
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,400
So like I have the timeline of gamergate, you know pulled

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,600
up.

86
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,800
I've been kind of going through that but I guess yeah,

87
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,900
you're going to educate me on gamergate God the ancient

88
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,100
lore of gamergate.

89
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,900
It's been like 10 fucking years.

90
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,300
Yeah, so sorry.

91
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,600
Go ahead.

92
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,000
Go ahead.

93
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,800
So it all started with this Zoe Quinn this post about Zoe

94
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,600
Quinn, right?

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Did you read the post?

96
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,900
I think it's still up.

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,500
Yeah, I read some of it.

98
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,200
I didn't read the entire thing, but basically her ex is

99
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,100
accusing her of cheating, right?

100
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,000
Mm-hmm.

101
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,100
Do you think that she actually cheated on him?

102
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,200
Oh, absolutely.

103
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
The guys confirmed it at least three out of the five of them

104
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,700
dead.

105
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah.

106
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,600
Like that part is not in dispute whatsoever that she did

107
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,100
cheat on.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,800
Yeah, so one of them was Nathan Grayson.

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,700
Let me just I'm just gonna pull his see what he's doing now.

110
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
God this ancient lore.

111
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,500
It's been so fucking long, dude, because what I was reading

112
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,500
I read a bunch of different things but but there were like

113
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,200
allegations that this guy was like abusive or whatever and

114
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,400
that like, I don't know how true that is right that he like

115
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
made up a whole bunch of stuff about her.

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,600
So I guess I'm curious to to know like I guess how was this

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
confirmed that she cheated on him?

118
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,700
One of the guys at least of the of the five guys, you know,

119
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,500
there was the five guys burgers and fries meme like that was

120
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,200
I was part of it.

121
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,600
Yeah.

122
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,900
One of the guys was Nathan Grayson and Nathan Grayson said

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,800
yes, we had a sexual relationship during during this time.

124
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
The issue ultimately wasn't the cheating actually, you know

125
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,000
what here before we get into it, you should you should give

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
me your view of gamergate like what you've learned about it

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,200
what you think of it, you should hit me with the stardust

128
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,300
interpretation first.

129
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,000
I know very little about it.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,800
I'm going to be real with you.

131
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,700
I know very little about I know that basically this post came

132
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,800
out about Zoe Quinn.

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,500
I know that it was less about the cheating and more about

134
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,600
about the incestuous relationship that game reporters have

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,600
with each other and and with a game developers and and it

136
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,800
was kind of like it was kind of like talking about the

137
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,700
corruption or not corruption, but like, you know, just the

138
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,700
I guess the weirdness of that of that industry and I know

139
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,600
that basically in response to this post being made about

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,300
about Zoe Quinn a bunch of report.

141
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,400
I think it was reporters spoke out against it.

142
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,700
Am I correct?

143
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,300
Yes.

144
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,200
Okay, and because they spoke out against it like the majority

145
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,900
of like the gaming world didn't really care about the post

146
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,100
initially, but because they they spoke out against it drew

147
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,000
more attention to it and then more of the gaming world kind

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,100
of kind of caught on to it and it became a bigger thing.

149
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:52,300
And then and then there were like some harassment campaigns

150
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,400
that happened and everything from that point on.

151
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
I'm a little bit.

152
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
I'm a little bit.

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,300
Yeah, I don't know a whole lot beyond that point.

154
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,000
So right, right.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,400
So you're already a far-right fascist for even bringing

156
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,900
up the ethics part of the conversation.

157
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,400
By the way, I hope you know that you've I'm sorry, just

158
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,600
one second wordsmith Andy.

159
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
Thank you so much for the super chat.

160
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,400
Sorry, go ahead.

161
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,600
No problem.

162
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,100
No problem.

163
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,400
The issue is that there's two competing narratives regarding

164
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,100
gamergate and it's now nine years ago and most of the people

165
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,900
who were pro gamergate don't care anymore because it's been

166
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,300
nine fucking years, right?

167
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,500
Yeah, like it's it's old internet drama.

168
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,700
If you go to Wikipedia, you can see the anti gamergate

169
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,200
description of events and from their point of view.

170
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,000
It's pretty accurate.

171
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,800
If you go to know your meme, you can see the pro gamergate

172
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,500
view of events.

173
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,700
So if you want to get an overview of what both sides actually

174
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,600
thought and like their versions of the timeline of events,

175
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,700
both of those sources will give it to you.

176
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,200
Um, there's if you were, if you were around in like 2015

177
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,500
or 2016, you saw three things kind of conflated very heavily

178
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,200
together in mainstream news.

179
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,700
And that was gamergate Brexit and Trump that gamergate caused

180
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,900
Brexit and then Brexit caused Trump.

181
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,600
And it was all gamergate cause Brexit.

182
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,900
That makes no sense to me.

183
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,900
I know.

184
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,100
And it's, it's some of the most ridiculous claims that

185
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,700
I have seen.

186
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,600
Or is just how like, okay, here, here, um, you know who

187
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,700
Mundane Matt is his part of the gamergate drama.

188
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,600
Uh, he made a video, right?

189
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,200
Yeah.

190
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,100
He made one of the first videos talking about the Zoe post

191
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
and because he was one of the first ones and he was the

192
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,100
one that Zoe Quinn chose to falsely DMCA to get his video

193
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,600
down, he blew up.

194
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,700
Wait, wait, wait, who, who?

195
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,100
Zoe DMC claimed him.

196
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:58,700
Yes.

197
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,000
Zoe Quinn falsely DMCA'd Mundane Matt to get his video on

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,300
the Zoe post taken down.

199
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,300
Okay.

200
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,100
And that's what made Mundane Matt blow up.

201
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,000
And that's what made a whole bunch of YouTubers suddenly

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,300
leap all over this story back in 2014, because that was

203
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,100
seen as like an egregious, you know, censorship.

204
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,600
Um, and Mundane Matt has since come out and said, now he's

205
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,100
more progressive now than he was back then.

206
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,600
And he's come out and he said stuff like, Hey, uh,

207
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,300
you know, I, you know, I'm sorry for my part because I

208
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,600
know that it led to, um, to the rise of reactionary politics.

209
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,700
It led to Trump.

210
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,400
It led to Brexit.

211
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,700
It led to all of these things.

212
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,800
And it's like, well, no, no, it didn't, but there is a

213
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,900
narrative that it did, and I can explain that narrative.

214
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,400
I don't really believe it, but I can explain it.

215
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,900
Um, the, the idea basically is, is that there's there, I

216
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,100
don't know if you were, if you were around 10 or 15 years

217
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,000
ago, but there's been like a slow turning leftward of a

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,400
lot of online spaces, you know, the, the old atheism of

219
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,500
the two thousands, where everyone's going around, like

220
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,000
just being intentionally edgy and tipping their fedoras

221
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,600
everywhere, those guys became like atheism plus where it

222
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,100
was all social justice focused.

223
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,600
You know, there was, there was like stuff happening in

224
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,700
comics, there was stuff happening in all of these,

225
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,600
these kind of cultural spaces online.

226
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,300
And then when it came, there was stuff happening in gaming

227
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,600
too, there was this general hatred and we're talking

228
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,500
like 2010, 2012, there was this general hatred of games

229
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
journalists by gamers at the time for being impartial.

230
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,900
And probably the first brush of it was the mass effect

231
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,600
three, um, the mass effect three ending controversy.

232
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,200
Do you remember that?

233
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Did you hear about that at all?

234
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,100
No, I didn't.

235
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,200
Okay.

236
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,400
So what happened?

237
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Let me just, uh, basically mass effect was like a, this

238
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,000
big trilogy on journal, like the on journey, the Xbox

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,100
three 60 times and the ending was absolute shit and gamers

240
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,400
got really mad at the game developers and kind of blew

241
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,200
up at them on Twitter.

242
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
This is back in again, like 2012 or something.

243
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,500
And if you like, if you search here, let me just pull

244
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:04,700
this out.

245
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,100
Where is it?

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Where, where, where is it?

247
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,300
Where is it?

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,600
Like if you search right now for mass effect three gamer

249
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,100
gate, even though this happened two years before, you

250
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,600
can find people saying that, Oh, this was the beginning

251
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
of the same sentiment that caused gamer gate.

252
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,400
You know, these, these gamers wouldn't accept what game

253
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,300
journalists were telling them and what, and what develop

254
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,100
indie developers were telling them and what, you know,

255
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,600
mainstream developers are telling them that they were

256
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,800
just angry and they were reactionary.

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,800
And they were these, they didn't use incel cause that

258
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,700
wasn't really a term back then, but, but they would have

259
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,100
cause they used internet virgins, which you can't really

260
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,700
say anymore because that's shaming somebody for their

261
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,300
sexual past.

262
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,900
That's now problematic.

263
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,300
So it was the same kind of idea.

264
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,400
And then there was already this like hatred between your

265
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,100
average gamer who, you know, back then wasn't really popular

266
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,300
games, weren't really that games weren't popular.

267
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,300
People who played them are kind of like derided in their

268
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,500
childhood and they hated these, these, these game journalists.

269
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,200
They already hated them.

270
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,800
So it was already like primed for, for this sort of cultural,

271
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,200
not, not, it's not a rebellion, but it's like a, you know,

272
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,800
we don't, we don't, we're just going to go against you

273
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,400
because we fucking hate you.

274
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,600
It's that, it's that sort of thing, right?

275
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,900
They're already primed for that.

276
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,200
And then when gamer gate happened, you had the two narratives

277
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,900
and the first one was that Zoe Quinn, who was this indie

278
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,400
game developer cheated on her boyfriend and that wasn't

279
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,700
so noteworthy, but she cheated on her boyfriend with five

280
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,800
people who were notable in, in games journalism and that

281
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,700
led to some sort of, some sort of, some sort of like, it's

282
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,400
not toxic, it's like some sort of like, yeah, some sort

283
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,300
of nepotism, some sort of like, like colluded relationship

284
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,600
because earlier Nathan Grayson, one of those guys that,

285
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,400
that had, that had slept with her earlier in the year, he

286
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,000
reported on a game jam that went South involving her and

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,300
JonTron was also there.

288
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,700
And JonTron spoken out about this as well, about like his

289
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,600
experiences with like the type of person that Zoe Quinn

290
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,600
is, but basically Zoe Quinn's behavior caused this game

291
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,800
jam to go South and there, and the only like real official

292
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,500
word of what happened there was Nathan Grayson's and

293
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,200
it's like, well, hold on.

294
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,100
Some guy lost like, like, like tens of thousands of dollars

295
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,300
on this project and the only person, the only, the only

296
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,900
person that you're giving the interpretation of events in

297
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,400
the public sphere is the person that you've been having

298
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,700
sex with secretly this whole time.

299
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, you know, that sounds like, and also like this guy

300
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,700
who, who hosted this game jam, he got slandered to shit

301
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,100
in the media and he was, he was thinking about like,

302
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,100
like suing these people because his reputation was

303
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,600
destroyed and the guy who destroyed it didn't reveal

304
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,300
that he had sex with, with the other person in the story

305
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,600
who was like his opponent in the story.

306
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,600
You know what I mean?

307
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,600
So it's like, I don't know how actually like in terms

308
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,100
of any, any sort of formal ethics, how unethical it

309
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,600
was, but it certainly felt unethical, especially

310
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,700
because they tried to hide it.

311
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,600
That was the worst part is that they tried to hide it.

312
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,700
Um, so there was, there were these five people and

313
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,220
actually I was heavily involved in, in gamer

314
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,000
gate when it happened.

315
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,200
Um, gamer gate was when my channel went from like

316
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,700
2000 subs to about 15 or 30,000 subs over the course

317
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,500
of like four months.

318
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,900
So like I got my first big bump from them, you

319
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,500
know, before, like before gamer gate, I had done

320
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,800
some anime reviews in like the, that guy with the

321
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,400
glasses channel, awesome style that didn't work

322
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,000
out, did some let's plays that was going like,

323
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,300
okay, but I did some gamer gate videos and that's

324
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,600
when I started doing politics content.

325
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,900
That's when I, that's when I met Sargon, that's

326
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,600
when I met like a bunch of like, you know, arch

327
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,900
Warhammer, that's when I met V, you know, um, a

328
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,100
bunch, a bunch of people that I hang around with

329
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,800
now that I'm still friends with them.

330
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,400
I met them through gamer gate initially.

331
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,600
Um, so the, the one interpretation of events

332
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,300
is that she was sleeping with these five guys

333
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,600
and that led to some sort of incestuous

334
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,900
relationship there where, you know, the, the,

335
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,500
the game journalist scene and the indie game

336
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
scene, it was all kind of a big clique, you know,

337
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,900
it's a big club and you're not in it.

338
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,800
And then you had people on the outside who were

339
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,400
generally just regular gamers who were

340
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,000
pissed about it.

341
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,000
And then the other narrative is that it's

342
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
a harassment campaign and that it's all about

343
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
sexism and that the only reason you're mad about

344
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,740
Zoe Quinn sleeping with these guys is because

345
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,300
you hate women's sexuality.

346
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,200
You hate women, you know, you're, you're

347
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,000
harassing these women and so on and so forth.

348
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,900
And there was definitely some harassment for

349
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,700
sure, like I can't just sit here and say it was

350
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,600
all sunshine and rainbows and everyone had like

351
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,900
the, the, you know, the most, the most moral

352
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,600
reason to be there.

353
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,900
I definitely saw some harassment of a random

354
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,100
woman, but I also saw a lot of good work done

355
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,400
too, in terms of uncovering, um, the

356
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,100
corruption of people.

357
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,500
Um, I spoke at one point to Zoe Quinn's ex, um,

358
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,700
is, is Aaron, is Aaron Joni or Goni or something?

359
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,600
I can't remember his last name.

360
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:58,600
Yeah.

361
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,300
Yeah.

362
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,200
I spoke to him privately, uh, at one point,

363
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,400
this was back in 2014 and he said, listen, you

364
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,900
know, they're trying to make it, this was like

365
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,000
in the, like the, like the early, the early weeks,

366
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,500
like two weeks in, like one weekend or something

367
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,200
to the controversy.

368
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,000
And he said, listen, they're trying to make

369
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,100
it a sexism issue.

370
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,400
They're probably going to succeed in making it

371
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,300
a story about sexism because they have the

372
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,000
institutional power.

373
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,900
They have the, they have the outlets they have,

374
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,900
you know, when, you know, when, when, when big,

375
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,500
let's say, you know, something like CNN or

376
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Forbes or whoever, like these, these bigger

377
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,000
outlets, when they report on, um, on, on like

378
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,400
a small hobby, like gaming or any other hobby,

379
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,000
they go to the enthusiast press.

380
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,500
So CNN will actually say, what is Kotaku saying?

381
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,400
Even though Kotaku is a shit rag, they are

382
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,800
the main enthusiast press.

383
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,800
They will, they will at least see what other

384
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,400
journalists are saying in, in that smaller press

385
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,500
to, when, when they report on something

386
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,200
that makes it big.

387
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,900
So Aaron basically said, they're probably

388
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,000
going to succeed in making it all about sexism.

389
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,000
But what you need to do is ignore, like there

390
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,100
are people out there who were talking about,

391
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
who were talking about how much of a, how

392
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
much of a slut Zoe is.

393
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,900
That's, that's not the issue here.

394
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,100
The issue is that you need to look at what

395
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,800
these people are actually doing.

396
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,040
And my biggest contribution to

397
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,100
Gamergate personally.

398
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:17,700
Um, and I, it was the, it sounds weird.

399
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,900
It sounds weird to say, it sounds like I'm

400
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,000
really blowing myself up here.

401
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,640
It wasn't that big of a deal, but it sounds

402
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,180
like it was basically an, uh, ending

403
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Phil Fish's career.

404
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,740
And it had, and that event had nothing to

405
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,040
do with sexism whatsoever.

406
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,040
There weren't even any women involved in that event.

407
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,240
Yeah.

408
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,840
Um, basically what happened, what I did,

409
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,340
that this, this was my big contribution.

410
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,380
Like other people did other things, you

411
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,600
know, internet, Mr.

412
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,580
Medica, he was digging up stuff.

413
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,500
Sargon was digging up stuff.

414
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,300
What, um, me and my friends dug up was that

415
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,400
early in Gamergate, somebody at Phil Fish's

416
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,760
company, Polytron, leaked their financial

417
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,140
documents to 4chan, all their internal

418
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,900
financial documents.

419
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,600
It's probably very illegal to actually

420
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,740
have a copy of these because they're

421
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,500
considered classified.

422
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,860
Um, but I got a copy of them.

423
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,300
Um, and there was three of us on the channel

424
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,640
at the time, and we kind of sat down and we

425
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,400
looked through them and we discovered in the

426
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,840
financial documents that a bunch of people who

427
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,340
had invested in Polytron.

428
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,540
So they had put some people put up like

429
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,900
$5,000 and people put up 10,000, 20,000.

430
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,260
You know, people put up these chunks of money

431
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,800
to own parts of Polytron.

432
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,560
These same people, they, um, they were also

433
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,860
judges at the Independent Games Festival.

434
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,960
And they were judges when the Polytron's

435
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,500
only game Fez won awards at, and during

436
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,160
two different years, the whole idea of the

437
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,940
IGF, the rules are basically, listen, you

438
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,200
can, you put forward a game for awards.

439
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,840
You can win, you know, game of the year.

440
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,640
You can win best sound design, best control,

441
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,900
best graphics, whatever, all you have, all

442
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,480
the awards, right?

443
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,540
But you can only put forward a game once you

444
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,700
put, you put it forward when the game launches

445
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,700
and Fez launched in 2012, but it won best

446
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,100
sound design in 2008.

447
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,700
And it won a few other, like a few other awards

448
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,600
in 2008 as well.

449
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,540
And then at one game of the year in 2012, back

450
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,800
in 2012, they said, listen, listen, it's

451
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,740
completely fine that it won two sets of awards

452
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,700
because we consider Fez's demo to be a different

453
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,600
game than Fez itself.

454
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,900
That was the only game that the IGF ever did

455
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,540
that for no one ever understood why.

456
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,100
Um, but then we realized two years later

457
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,440
during gamer gate, after we got a hold of the

458
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,600
financial documents that the judges, the people

459
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,340
at the IGF were the same people who invested

460
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,500
in the company that put out Fez.

461
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,500
And so they stood to profit from increased

462
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,400
valuation of the company.

463
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:33,960
Yeah.

464
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,160
So I put this into a video, we edit it

465
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,200
together, we put it out.

466
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,100
Um, the video goes fucking gangbusters.

467
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,300
It got like 500,000 views in like 30

468
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:43,960
minutes or something.

469
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,160
Like it was, it was going wild.

470
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,160
Um, and then Phil Fish sent me a cease

471
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,860
and desist, and he said, you need to

472
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,160
fucking take this video down right now.

473
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,000
Or else I'm going to sue you.

474
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,560
And I was, uh, I was nine years younger,

475
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,160
just out of university, had no backbone, no

476
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,820
fucking clue if YouTube would work out or not.

477
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,700
I had no money, no nothing.

478
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,620
So I took it down.

479
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,520
Um, I put it back up a few months later and

480
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,400
it's still up on my channel.

481
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,200
You can go back and watch it.

482
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,120
All the evidence is in the video, but, um, the

483
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,020
fact that it was up for like an hour and then

484
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,000
it went down and then like mirrors of it

485
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,240
started popping up and it started going viral

486
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,560
on Twitter and everyone was talking about this

487
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,900
big revelation of Phil Fish.

488
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,460
Um, the next day, and this is still in the

489
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,700
archives of their site too.

490
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,860
Cause I, I actually made a little, a short

491
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,660
video describing what happened with me and

492
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,000
Phil Fish, just to, just to kind of update new,

493
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,200
my new viewers in the old lore.

494
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,540
Um, on the IGFs website, you can see.

495
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,140
So they're like, uh, so you might've seen

496
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,300
recently some weird, some weird allegations,

497
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,940
but we've investigated ourselves and discovered

498
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,760
that we did nothing wrong.

499
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,920
It was one of those like very boilerplate

500
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,560
statements, right?

501
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,260
So no one fucking trusted these guys anymore.

502
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,020
Since then, no one's really cared about what

503
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,760
the IGF has, has, has done.

504
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,960
They've been like in a slow decline and Phil

505
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,660
Fish hasn't released a game since, since

506
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,320
gamer gate, he, he, he just left the internet.

507
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,160
He left the internet, he left indie gaming.

508
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,720
He left all of it.

509
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,920
And you know, now I'm 135,000 subs, which

510
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,800
isn't, which isn't small, but it's not big,

511
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,660
but it's big enough that some people know who I

512
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,460
am and I've basically heard from people who

513
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,960
who, you know, are games journalists who

514
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,060
watch me, who are game developers who watch

515
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,720
me, you know, the, the, there, there are

516
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,820
people who have like messaged me and said,

517
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,960
listen, you can't reveal who I am.

518
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,660
I'll lose my job.

519
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,520
But just so you know, no one wants to work

520
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,420
with Phil Fish anymore.

521
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,520
And that's why he's gone.

522
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Wow.

523
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,620
And I've heard that from like about five

524
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,660
different people now that he's, he's just, he,

525
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,560
I, I basically nuked his career.

526
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
Holy shit.

527
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,220
How does that feel?

528
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,960
It feels, it feels pretty good.

529
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,520
I mean, like, like no one likes the whole

530
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,660
cancel culture thing, but like, this was

531
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,320
actual corruption.

532
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,560
This was not like, Oh, you, you have a mean

533
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,760
tweet where you said the N word 10 years ago.

534
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,620
So we're going to get, we're going to get you

535
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,860
fired from your wagey job.

536
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,200
But that wasn't that, this is something

537
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,000
different, you know, this is somebody who

538
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,260
actually behaved inappropriately.

539
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:05,160
And the thing is, none of this story has

540
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,220
anything to do with sexism or harassment

541
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,820
whatsoever.

542
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,920
So, so they're, they're definitely, you

543
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,820
know, if there is a side to gamer gate that

544
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,420
wasn't about that, at the very least, it was

545
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,280
me, I can personally confirm that I wasn't

546
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,880
part of that stuff.

547
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:21,820
Yeah.

548
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,280
Um, I don't think Sargon was either from all

549
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,620
that I, from all that I know of him, he doesn't

550
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,180
seem like the type.

551
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,720
Um, however, like in just, just to prepare

552
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,460
for this, I went back and watched a bit of

553
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,020
my old videos.

554
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,760
Oh God, they're so hard to watch, man.

555
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,980
Like the shittiest mic, the shittiest audio

556
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,060
quality was 2014.

557
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,380
I had no fucking clue, you know, but, um,

558
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,780
I went back and watched some of them and

559
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,940
even like in my second gamer gate video, I

560
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,180
was like, listen, I have seen some harassment.

561
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,280
You guys got to cut the shit out.

562
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,580
All right.

563
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,840
Where we're trying to discover that these

564
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,280
people are actually really fucking corrupt.

565
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,940
You got to cut this out.

566
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,980
So even back then I was, I was a bit of a don't

567
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,680
harass people kind of cuck.

568
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,480
You know what I mean?

569
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:01,580
Yeah.

570
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:04,980
Interesting.

571
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,140
That's what I did.

572
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,440
That's what I did personally, but in terms

573
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,740
of gamer gate as a whole, um, man, there's

574
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
so much like old lore.

575
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,340
I was, I was talking to Chud Logic about

576
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,440
this in private a few days ago.

577
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,240
You wanted to try and arrange a conversation

578
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,900
between me and Brianna Wu because she was very

579
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,840
like anti gamer gate, like one of the most

580
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,240
vocal anti gamer gate people.

581
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,200
And I'm like, you can do that Chud, but I

582
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,380
have old evidence from back in the day that

583
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,200
Brianna Wu faked her own harassment.

584
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,000
I've been sitting on it for nine

585
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,040
fucking years, Chud.

586
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,800
We can, we can do this if you want, but

587
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,140
it's not going to end well for her.

588
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,200
Wow.

589
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,240
Yeah.

590
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,500
Let's see if I can dig it up for you.

591
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,300
If you want to see it, hold on.

592
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,900
Let me go into the, the Chud DMS real quick.

593
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,440
And so I don't know if that conversation

594
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,740
is going to happen or not.

595
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,540
Yeah.

596
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,100
Holy moly.

597
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,100
Let's see here.

598
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,040
I'm going to scroll up.

599
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,540
Chud and I talk a fair amount, so it's

600
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,700
kind of deep in the DMS now.

601
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:01,700
Yeah.

602
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,140
Um, and it seems like, uh, you know, the,

603
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:12,300
the reputation of these, uh, game gaming,

604
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,100
like journalists, journalism, you know,

605
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,800
sites and platforms or whatever, um,

606
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,440
haven't really improved.

607
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,660
Like for the most part, everybody still

608
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,000
thinks that Kotaku is, you know, shit.

609
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,100
Everybody still thinks that, um, it just

610
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,400
seems like, it seems like for the most

611
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,300
part, people still don't trust, uh, these

612
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,260
like reporters.

613
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,560
Yeah.

614
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,600
Well, the issue is they never like

615
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,640
came out and apologized.

616
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,140
I remember Medeker saying like a week or

617
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,540
two in that if they just said, listen, yeah,

618
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,540
we fucked up, we're sorry.

619
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,440
We won't do it again.

620
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,540
I think everyone had forgiven them, but

621
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,140
they still haven't.

622
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,640
They said, it's about sexism.

623
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,740
It's only about sexism.

624
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,740
If you imply that it's about anything other

625
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,100
than sexism, you're a sexist.

626
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,740
So like, because that was, there was, there

627
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,940
was just this, this, this hegemonic, um, you

628
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,640
know, circling of the wagons where it's like,

629
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
this was the narrative.

630
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,180
If you disagreed, you were a sexist.

631
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,880
And then two years later it became racist.

632
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,080
And two years later it became fascist.

633
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,980
This is kind of where that, that whole

634
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,420
radicalization of the Overton window started

635
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,080
was, I think, I think that's what started

636
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
it was what was a gamer gate.

637
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,580
I don't think that like gamer gate

638
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,780
caused Trump or Brexit.

639
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,880
I think that gamer gate started a slow

640
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,220
media radicalization that contributed to

641
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,540
those two events later.

642
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,740
And is now why we're, we're living in like

643
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,880
a media hellscape where people are getting

644
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,980
canceled over 10 year old tweets and fucking

645
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,620
like everything is the most possible woke.

646
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,580
And it's just ridiculous.

647
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,720
You know, it makes sense that also that's

648
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,860
the start of when people stop trusting,

649
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,120
um, like media, right.

650
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,460
They stopped trusting media.

651
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,480
They stopped trusting mainstream media.

652
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,580
Um, and for a good reason, and we can

653
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,160
still see people are very skeptical of

654
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,580
mainstream media today.

655
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,780
Um, so I think it very much is related.

656
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,180
Yeah.

657
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,420
Okay.

658
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,080
Regarding, we're going to woo, check out,

659
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,580
check this out.

660
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,860
You can, this is not something

661
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,460
that's been doctored.

662
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,660
You can find this all over the internet.

663
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,820
This is old deep lore.

664
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,960
I just DMed it to you.

665
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,900
So pull that up and let me know

666
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,060
what it looks like to you.

667
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,760
It looks like a tweet.

668
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:12,500
Yeah.

669
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,700
Uh, and, uh, chat can't see this.

670
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,660
Um,

671
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,700
Oh, I can't see it.

672
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,600
Uh, should I show it to chat?

673
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,060
Do you want me to show it?

674
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,220
Yeah, sure.

675
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,620
Yeah, go ahead.

676
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,200
Yeah, go ahead.

677
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:21,800
All right.

678
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,720
One, let me share it.

679
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,320
Okay.

680
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,620
It says, and here's the part of the

681
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,260
night where I call the police.

682
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Um, and it's like a quote, tweet of

683
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,420
death to Brianna.

684
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,080
I've got a K bar and I'm coming to your

685
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,020
house so I can shove it up your ugly

686
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,980
feminist con.

687
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:41,920
Yeah.

688
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,880
Look at the, um, when that

689
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,920
other tweet was posted.

690
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,880
So this was 19 seconds.

691
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,380
19 seconds earlier.

692
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,360
Yeah.

693
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,420
So what is, what are the chances that

694
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,980
Brianna Wu saw this in 19 seconds

695
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,780
and then tweeted about it?

696
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,160
Um, I don't know.

697
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,600
What, what are the, what are the odds?

698
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,700
It seems a bit more likely that maybe

699
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,820
this might be her sock account.

700
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,620
Because to find a tweet in seconds

701
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,360
was unheard of back in 2014.

702
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,200
It took several minutes to push those up.

703
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,200
Yeah.

704
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,000
And she must've been getting a lot of,

705
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,660
um, she may, it must've been getting a

706
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,820
lot of notifications as well back then.

707
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,300
Yeah.

708
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:27,800
Yeah.

709
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:28,660
Yeah.

710
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,620
Uh, but even that, that is, um, let's

711
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,120
see, that's a bit less con that's a bit

712
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,920
less ironclad because, you know, maybe

713
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,060
she did actually see it in 19 seconds.

714
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,320
Who knows?

715
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:38,460
Right.

716
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:38,820
Who knows?

717
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,060
But notice in that tweet, her that's

718
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,260
her old name, space cat gal.

719
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,760
That was like the name of her game company

720
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,520
back before she, when she was making games.

721
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,060
Um, okay.

722
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,960
This is also old lore, not doctored.

723
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,060
Many people can confirm this.

724
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,680
This one is a picture of the discussions

725
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:02,660
page on her game on steam where she

726
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,000
accidentally posts harassment to herself

727
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,160
under her own name, forgetting to log

728
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,200
out and log into her, her, her sock account.

729
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,160
If PSX had a development and noted feminist

730
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,660
Brianna Wu, a terrible person, um, 8chan

731
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,360
gamer gate and Kotaku in action,

732
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,560
knock yourselves out.

733
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,400
And okay.

734
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,920
So she's the poster.

735
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,400
Yeah.

736
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,600
Yeah.

737
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,140
Oof.

738
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,760
That's like very cringe.

739
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,300
That's a cringe moment for sure.

740
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,960
What did she have to say about it?

741
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,760
She has never once talked

742
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,640
about this in public.

743
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,400
She has always ignored it when it comes up.

744
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:43,940
Wow.

745
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,660
I don't think, I don't think anyone's like

746
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,540
talked to her about it in a panel or anything,

747
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
uh, or in an interview.

748
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,300
And whenever someone like, like messages

749
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,700
her on Twitter, she just ignores it.

750
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,660
She just doesn't reply.

751
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,500
This is something that she

752
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,660
has just tried to bury.

753
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,840
Yeah.

754
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,340
Wow.

755
00:28:59,500 --> 00:28:59,960
Okay.

756
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,660
It reminds me of, uh, oh, who was it?

757
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,720
Was it Stefan Molyneux who did it where

758
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,560
he like, he's like, he, he, he replies to

759
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,220
his own video and somewhere where he's

760
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,220
like, I'm actually like a black woman.

761
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,220
And I remember that fuck.

762
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:13,960
That was ridiculous.

763
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:14,820
Yeah.

764
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,520
Oh, that's what it was.

765
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,420
Oh fuck.

766
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,260
It reminds it's, it's exactly like that.

767
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,220
And it's like, man, guys, guys, how, how

768
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,620
is it that you're like, if you're so

769
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,200
desperate, like how could the narrative

770
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,300
is that these people are being harassed

771
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,600
so much, why do you have to fake it?

772
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
If you're being harassed that much?

773
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,040
Yeah.

774
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,360
Um, somebody in chat says, start, could

775
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,760
it not just be that she was trying

776
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,660
to get feedback on herself?

777
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,860
I mean, yeah, if we wanted to be like

778
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,500
super, if we wanted to be the most

779
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,360
charitable possible, maybe, but then why

780
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,000
wouldn't she just say that, I guess, why

781
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,600
wouldn't she just address it and say that

782
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,060
much?

783
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,160
Yeah.

784
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,140
If you really want to steal a minute, it

785
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,660
does maybe read like she's being, she's

786
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,920
like self-flagellating here, but I don't

787
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,320
think so.

788
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,060
I don't think so.

789
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,400
Yeah.

790
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:02,600
Yeah.

791
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,320
Yeah.

792
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
And the fact that she wouldn't talk

793
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,100
about it later.

794
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:05,400
Yeah.

795
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:05,920
Yeah.

796
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,260
Yeah.

797
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,100
I mean, yeah, it's easy to just be like,

798
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,000
yeah, I was looking for feedback on myself

799
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,660
or I was feeling, you know, um, a certain

800
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,220
type of way or something like that.

801
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,520
Wow.

802
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:15,720
Yep.

803
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,220
I was in an, in a depressive spiral or

804
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,460
something, but nope, she just ignores it.

805
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,020
And she has for nine years now.

806
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,660
So, yeah.

807
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,020
Um, so yeah, that's, that's the

808
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,120
Brianna Wu stuff.

809
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,220
Uh, there's something else I wanted to

810
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,980
bring up what we're talking about right

811
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,580
before Brianna Wu.

812
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,080
Do you remember?

813
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,880
Uh, we were talking about how you ended,

814
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,320
um, uh, yeah, Phil Fish's career.

815
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:40,620
Yeah.

816
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,580
I mean, I like, I put up like, like a

817
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,980
TikTok it's like two minutes long that

818
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,180
kind of describes the whole thing, but

819
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,280
you mean you already heard me describe it.

820
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,480
It just shows a few screenshots of what

821
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:48,820
happened.

822
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,580
It's not a big deal.

823
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,520
Um, shit.

824
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,980
Oh, yes.

825
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,620
Do you remember the, the gamers are

826
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,480
dead part of it?

827
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,340
I don't.

828
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,040
Okay.

829
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,180
Let me just here.

830
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,040
I'm going to the know your meme page

831
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,180
here.

832
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,420
I'll link this to you just so you could

833
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,580
read it later if you like, because the

834
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,020
know your meme page and the Wikipedia

835
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,140
page are good for the book are good for

836
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,740
the two sides.

837
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,320
Um, let's see.

838
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,980
Let me just control effort.

839
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,140
Oops.

840
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,480
Oh, it's out here.

841
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,720
It doesn't matter.

842
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,680
This is one of those, another one of

843
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,920
those images you can just find just by

844
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,980
searching gamers are dead.

845
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,880
It's yep.

846
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,380
Here it is.

847
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:36,980
Oh, come on.

848
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,740
Why is it like 300 pixels wide guys?

849
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,080
Give me the original.

850
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,580
Hold on.

851
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,640
Hold on just a second.

852
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:50,820
Okay.

853
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,380
Yeah.

854
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,120
So this happened about one week after

855
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,340
the Zoe post dropped.

856
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:55,880
Okay.

857
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,540
Uh, here, I'm going to post, I'm going

858
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,280
to give you this image here.

859
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,740
So this ha this happened about one

860
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,840
week after the Zoe post dropped and there

861
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,180
was this huge, you know, consumer backlash.

862
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,440
All of these gaming sites put forward

863
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,940
articles saying gamers are dead.

864
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:15,680
Gamers are over.

865
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,940
It's the end of the gamer gaming is

866
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,940
leaving gamers behind the identity of

867
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,440
gamer is, is done is gone.

868
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,940
That's it.

869
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,280
All right.

870
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,320
All right.

871
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,280
And they all came out like within

872
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,020
an hour of each other.

873
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,140
Yeah.

874
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,880
And so, so total biscuit, who I think

875
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,980
he was, he was still alive at the time.

876
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,420
He didn't die till I think 2017, right?

877
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,440
Total biscuit.

878
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,680
He said, he, he, he famously said on

879
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,340
Twitter, I've never seen anything like this.

880
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,820
I've never seen anything like this level of

881
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,920
coordination or collaboration.

882
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,320
And all of these articles talked about

883
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,220
how Anita Sarkeesian was, um, was getting

884
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,820
harassment due to this, how Brianna

885
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,660
Wu was getting harassment to this, due

886
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,180
to this, how the path forward for, for

887
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,960
progress in the games industry was for

888
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,920
journalists and independent game developers

889
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,260
to no longer consider gamers to be their

890
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,220
audience and to say, yeah, you have a group

891
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,480
of people who are, you know, they're pretty

892
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,120
socially, not, not that well adjusted.

893
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,620
They're kind of maligned, they're kind of

894
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,060
nerdy and you know, and then, and the only

895
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,780
thing they really have as in terms of a

896
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,380
collective identity is gamer as you know,

897
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,940
as in celly as that sounds, when you have

898
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,840
the enthusiast press attacking them like

899
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,240
this, it doesn't go over well.

900
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,980
That's got a lot of people angry.

901
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,640
People were very, very angry when this

902
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:33,940
happened.

903
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,820
Um, yeah, that, yeah, it looks sus.

904
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,820
It just looks so, so, I mean, not even

905
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,220
sus, it just looks like, you know,

906
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,880
conclusive that all of these people are

907
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,680
coordinated, um, essentially.

908
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,720
So there, there's no doubt about it.

909
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,360
Yeah.

910
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,420
Yeah.

911
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,760
And then it came out, uh, three or

912
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,360
four months later, there was, uh, a game

913
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,880
journalist named Billy D who ran a website

914
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,960
called one angry gamer.

915
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,960
He was part of a Google group called game

916
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,520
journal pros, where it turned out that they

917
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,060
were all in there discussing what articles

918
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,780
to publish, what political opinions were

919
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,260
safe to put forward, what you were, what you

920
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,780
should publish on your website, what you

921
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,920
shouldn't publish on your website.

922
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,520
And they were all colluding it.

923
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,620
Um, Billy D gave the information to Milo.

924
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,660
Milo published it on Breitbart and that

925
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:30,520
was Milo's big, uh, his, his first big

926
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,160
breakaway he took off because of publishing

927
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,260
Billy D's leak.

928
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,220
So Milo was even involved in gamer gate.

929
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:38,880
Yes.

930
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,860
Milo was, no one had heard of, had heard

931
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,820
of Milo before gamer gate.

932
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,580
Milo was where he blew up, sorry.

933
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,660
Gamer gate was where Milo blew up.

934
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,020
Okay.

935
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,380
Wow.

936
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,380
Um, there you go.

937
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,580
I'm going to try to find the game

938
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,380
journal pros.

939
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,540
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

940
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,540
I mean, Oh, there's like a bunch of articles

941
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,820
describing it and like who was on it.

942
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,340
If you search for the, the name game

943
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,440
journal pros, you'll find it.

944
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,380
But like there's a bunch of articles

945
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,680
of describing what happened.

946
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,680
Yeah, I can, I can post you an article, I

947
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,920
guess, but like a lot of this is just, you

948
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,660
know, reading, you know, reading old lore.

949
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,020
Yeah.

950
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,560
But yeah, uh, what was being said and how

951
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,020
things were, were being colluded in game

952
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,060
journal pros was leaked.

953
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,120
Milo was the one who leaked it that

954
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,760
basically made Milo's career.

955
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,820
That's how we got started.

956
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,060
And then he, he moved on to, to, he, he moved

957
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,020
on to bigger things in 2015 with Brexit and

958
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,860
2016 with Trump, but he got started doing

959
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,520
gamer gate stuff.

960
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:44,960
Wow.

961
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,200
Someone in your chat says as much as

962
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,860
gamer gate went off the rails, this

963
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,060
aspect is indisputable.

964
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,760
They instigated a reaction and then cited

965
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,600
the reaction to justify the instigation.

966
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,260
Yeah, that sounds, that sounds pretty

967
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,400
similar to what happened.

968
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,000
That like a lot of, a lot of the gamers,

969
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,100
like just blew up and a lot of them went

970
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,760
overboard during gamer gate, but they, but

971
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,100
they went overboard because of the, of

972
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,000
the terrible, the consistent, terrible

973
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
behavior of all of these people.

974
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,200
And then after that, they went overboard

975
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,300
that's what they use to justify their

976
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:15,700
behavior.

977
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,400
They said, Oh, well, we, we don't need

978
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,860
to, you know, gamers don't actually need

979
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,860
to be our audience anymore because look

980
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,860
at how they blow up when we insult them.

981
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,500
And it's like, well, okay.

982
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,400
Yeah.

983
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:26,700
Yeah.

984
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,060
Oh yeah.

985
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,860
I'm seeing it here now in the timeline.

986
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,300
So yeah, the timeline in this time, I'll

987
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,100
link the timeline, but, and you can tell

988
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,600
me how accurate this timeline is.

989
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,700
I think it's, it's, it's, it's, it's

990
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,400
funny how accurate this timeline is.

991
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,500
You know, but this is where it was.

992
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,160
Oh, rational Wiki, but they're also

993
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,100
slanted, but that's fine.

994
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,100
Everyone has their slanted.

995
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,200
Oh yeah.

996
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:54,960
Yeah.

997
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,100
They're, they're like hyper feminist

998
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,460
actually.

999
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:57,860
Oh, for real.

1000
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,360
Yeah.

1001
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,060
I just, I was looking at it because it's

1002
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,140
like the most comprehensive timeline I

1003
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,300
could find, but if there's a better one

1004
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,340
around, you know, I'm

1005
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,460
know your meme, know your memes page is

1006
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,300
pretty good on it too, but it's from a

1007
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,500
completely different political point of

1008
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:11,660
view.

1009
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,200
Yeah.

1010
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,800
Okay.

1011
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,400
Let's see here.

1012
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,300
I'm just going to quickly skim it.

1013
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,360
So yeah, I see this.

1014
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,000
Um,

1015
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,100
mundane Matt publishes the Zoe post

1016
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,600
not August 16th.

1017
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,000
Yep.

1018
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,300
Yeah, there's, there's deep lore of

1019
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,400
like, of all these people involved, man.

1020
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,300
Like, so there's somebody that Zoe Quinn

1021
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,200
drove to suicide completely unrelated

1022
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,800
to gamer gate, you know, like all of

1023
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,100
these people have a history that would

1024
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,800
that, that can serve as its own video

1025
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
independent from what they've done with

1026
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,600
gamer gate.

1027
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,500
Um, yeah, somebody in chat was mentioning

1028
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,800
that, um, Alec Holoka.

1029
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,500
Yeah.

1030
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,100
Did he make night in the woods?

1031
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:09,500
Huh?

1032
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:12,900
Yeah.

1033
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,000
Alec Holowalk, a Canadian game developer.

1034
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,500
Yeah.

1035
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,100
Killed himself.

1036
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,200
Yep.

1037
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,300
He killed himself October, 2019.

1038
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,400
And how did that happen?

1039
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,100
Like, why do people say that she contributed

1040
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,600
to that?

1041
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,100
Uh, basically Zoe made false rape

1042
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,200
allegations against him and destroyed his

1043
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,900
career and he was already like prone to

1044
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,900
depressive bouts.

1045
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,100
I haven't looked at that story, um, in a

1046
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,300
long time, I have to go back and actually

1047
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:43,800
look at that one.

1048
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,000
Cause it wasn't related to gamer gate.

1049
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,100
It was like its own thing.

1050
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,700
There was a lot of like weird, deep lore.

1051
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,500
You know, like if the precursor to Kiwi

1052
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,300
farms that existed back then, cause it was

1053
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,800
before Kiwi farms, I think, you know, like

1054
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,500
they were digging around like Zoe Quinn's

1055
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,100
family and they found her original name

1056
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,500
because that's not her original name.

1057
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,500
They discovered that like, you know, her,

1058
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,000
her father comes from like old European

1059
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,500
money and like her boyfriend was like

1060
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,300
this guy who was the son of like an arms

1061
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,900
dealer, there was a bunch of weird shit

1062
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,600
that people found.

1063
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,100
And it was all really interesting and kind

1064
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,600
of fun and exciting to be like, Oh my God,

1065
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,300
we're discovering the secrets of like, of

1066
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,100
these people who, of these hipsters, who,

1067
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,900
they're almost like, like the late, like

1068
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,500
discovering like, like secrets of like, of

1069
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,900
like the upper class, you know what I mean?

1070
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,000
Like these people who have a lot of money,

1071
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,100
they're traveling around, they're going to

1072
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,500
different countries or going to all these events.

1073
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,700
It was, there was like, there's a big, there's

1074
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,000
an excitement part to it where you're like

1075
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,900
uncovering these, these weird secrets.

1076
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,700
Like, why is it that this, this, this

1077
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,800
hyper-socialist guy, Oh, he, he, he comes

1078
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,000
from old money and his dad selling weapons

1079
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,100
to Israel, like, Holy shit.

1080
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,800
You know, stories like that kept coming

1081
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,100
up about everyone, but in, but that was all

1082
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,100
like fun side stuff that contributed to the

1083
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,400
character of these people.

1084
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,400
But the actual gamer gate conversation

1085
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,700
itself was the, the, um, the game journalists

1086
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,000
and the independent developers who collaborate,

1087
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,600
who, uh, who agree to set narratives.

1088
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,500
Where, where money's changing hands sometimes.

1089
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,100
And then on the flip side, it was the

1090
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,900
harassment that these people received.

1091
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,100
Some of it legitimate, some of it illegitimate.

1092
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,100
Some of it deserved.

1093
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,200
I mean, not, not legitimate, you know what,

1094
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,700
you know what I mean?

1095
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,600
Like, like, um, deserve because they had

1096
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,100
behaved poorly, some of it not deserved

1097
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,200
because they were just, the people

1098
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,900
were just going crazy.

1099
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:23,700
Yeah.

1100
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,500
Um, so let me go back to the time.

1101
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,900
I want to see, yeah.

1102
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,000
How did Brianna Wu like contribute to stuff?

1103
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,500
Cause I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

1104
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:38,100
when I looked at thisconomical OCA, it

1105
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,500
says he was accused of physical and emotional

1106
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,900
abuse by Zoe Quinn.

1107
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:46,600
Um, did you mention Brianna women relation to that,

1108
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,300
no, no, she's not related.

1109
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,900
To the alcohol oil crate store or Anita

1110
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,900
Sarkeesian and Briana Wu, both inserted

1111
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,400
themselves into gamer gate.

1112
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,700
The Zoe post, didn't mention them.

1113
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,480
There's only post mentioned so we

1114
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,480
Quinn and the five guys that basically it, um, Anita Sarkeesian was already

1115
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,120
like, she was already kind of hated for the feminist frequency series.

1116
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,000
That was going since 2010 or something or 2011.

1117
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,840
Um, and it's my personal opinion that Anita Sarkeesian and Brianna

1118
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,760
Wu both inserted themselves into gamer gate and said, Hey, we're women too.

1119
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,500
We're also facing harassment to guys because it was a way to bolster their

1120
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,800
career, it was the same thing that Milo did, they all found opportunities

1121
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,880
to make their, to the kind of, you know, bump up their profile, make a

1122
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,800
name for themselves, grow their brand.

1123
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,640
They saw, you know, a, this rather organic, um, uh, cultural event

1124
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,640
happening on the internet and everyone jumped in out to try it, to try

1125
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,880
and basically pump themselves up.

1126
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,440
And that's the only reason that Brianna Wu was involved in it.

1127
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:50,800
She did.

1128
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,960
She, she wasn't involved in any of the actual events.

1129
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,000
Okay.

1130
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,040
I'm trying to look for, um, the timeline that you're, you said

1131
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,040
there's a timeline on know your meme.

1132
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,520
Yeah, I'll post it.

1133
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,680
Yeah, here it is.

1134
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,680
What do you think is the most like unbiased one?

1135
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,360
Um, good luck.

1136
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,040
10 years on everyone's kind of like set in their ways regarding

1137
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,320
a narrative, you know, good luck.

1138
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,480
If you like, if you search gamer gate right now, here, here, I'm going to go.

1139
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,680
I'm just going to see if this is true.

1140
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:26,840
Okay.

1141
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,600
I'm going to go over to Twitter.

1142
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,600
I'm going to search gamer game.

1143
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,200
All right.

1144
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,760
What do you, what are the latest tweets that say the word gamer game, aside from

1145
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,240
yours and mine, because we just tweeted about it, right?

1146
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:34,680
Yeah.

1147
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,560
Um, I don't know people accusing people of being fascist or something.

1148
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,400
Yeah.

1149
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,360
Yeah.

1150
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,760
Like, man, what was it?

1151
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,880
Hassan recently said that because the developer of the atomic heart video

1152
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,840
game didn't have any like left-leaning woke people, social justice people on the

1153
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,560
development team, and it was all like, like a bunch of kind of nerdy guys.

1154
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,560
Hassan said this was, this was a gamer gate developer.

1155
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,520
And I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?

1156
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,800
Is that what gamer gate is now?

1157
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,600
Yeah, it's not going to find that one.

1158
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,200
Dude Hassan Hassan's hilarious.

1159
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,440
He's like the, the gift that keeps on giving when it comes to terrible takes.

1160
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,240
Yeah, certainly is.

1161
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:18,640
Yeah.

1162
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,040
I can't believe like the amount of terrible takes that one person can have.

1163
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,960
Let's see here.

1164
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,280
What do you think about this?

1165
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:34,440
So when I was looking through the rational Wiki, um, it said that somewhere in it, it

1166
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:45,760
says that, um, the Zoe Quinn post was debunked by, was it, let's see.

1167
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,800
Um, debunked by Yoni himself.

1168
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,280
Um, let's see, I'm doing the control F for debunked and see what we get.

1169
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,920
Uh, let's see.

1170
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,120
According to IRC logs, the Zoe post was later edited by Aaron.

1171
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,640
The original accusations were later debunked by himself.

1172
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,080
Let's see what this debunking is.

1173
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,760
Zoe Quinn, Aaron clarifies the Zoe Quinn, Nathan Grayson timeline.

1174
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,640
Let's see what the debunking is.

1175
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,280
I'm going to read this.

1176
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:46,960
Okay.

1177
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,560
I know what this is.

1178
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,160
I know what this is.

1179
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,000
Okay.

1180
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,480
Um, I think it was, it was either mundane, Matt or internet aristocrat.

1181
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,800
It was one of the two and I think it might be mundane, Matt, um, that made the claim

1182
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:07,000
that Zoe Quinn got favorable coverage of her game depression quest because of the

1183
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,880
fact that she was sleeping with Nathan, Nathan Grayson and Nathan Grayson, Grayson

1184
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,920
Nathan Grayson Grayson never, um, never reviewed the game depression quest.

1185
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,240
So that's true.

1186
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,800
Um, that was something that was floating around that I remember seeing repeated a

1187
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,960
lot during gamer gate, but it wasn't true.

1188
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,400
That part was actually false.

1189
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:35,000
Um, what was true was not the, the, uh, the, the review of depression

1190
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,880
quest that never existed.

1191
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,680
What was actually true was the coverage of the game jam.

1192
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,400
The game jam coverage was the actual thing.

1193
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,680
That, that Nathan Grayson reported on after he had slept with Zoe Quinn and Zoe

1194
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,200
Quinn was one of the principles in the story.

1195
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,640
And he had every reason to, to basically make the story look good for Zoe because

1196
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,000
Zoe faced potential legal action.

1197
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,440
If it, if it looked like she had intentionally tanked the game jam because

1198
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,800
she had her own game jam coming up soon, which she did.

1199
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:04,600
Yeah.

1200
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,520
Okay.

1201
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,000
Do you know what a game jam is?

1202
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,240
I don't know what a game jam is now.

1203
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:09,880
Okay.

1204
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,480
A game jam is a tournament where you get together a bunch of people and you

1205
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,720
sit them down in a room for like 24 hours or 48 hours or whatever.

1206
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,720
And you say, make a game.

1207
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,080
Make, make, make, just make, make a game really quick.

1208
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:20,560
All right.

1209
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,480
And it's like televised and it's like,

1210
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,680
yeah, I do know what this is.

1211
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,000
Okay.

1212
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,400
Yeah.

1213
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,320
So Zoe Quinn was invited to one and she had her own competing one lined up.

1214
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:31,600
Yeah.

1215
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,560
And there's reports that she intentionally tanked the one she was

1216
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,720
inviting on to get more eyes on hers.

1217
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,720
And the only person who reported on the event was the guy she was fucking.

1218
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,040
That's where the collusion is.

1219
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,160
It has nothing to do with, with, with, with reviewing Zoe's games.

1220
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,640
So how did, um, how, how did she intentionally tank the

1221
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,760
game jam, the competing one?

1222
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,120
I'd have to go back and see.

1223
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,360
That's, that's some deep lore.

1224
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,240
I don't, I don't remember exactly what it was, but I remember, I remember

1225
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,800
that she somehow intentionally tanked it and I had a chance to, hold on.

1226
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:06,920
Oh, fuck it.

1227
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,480
I had a, fuck it.

1228
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,400
I had a chance to, um, ask John Tron at one point who was part of the game jam.

1229
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,360
Like, did she actually intentionally tank it?

1230
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:14,960
And he was like, yeah.

1231
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,040
And he, he confirmed it to me personally.

1232
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,560
So I tend to believe it, but in terms of how she tanked the game jam,

1233
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,600
I have to go look that up.

1234
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,880
It was the centerpiece of one of internet aristocrats old videos,

1235
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,400
but I can't remember the details.

1236
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,040
Okay.

1237
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,520
Me too.

1238
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,080
There's just so much, there's so much deep lore in this that like, I

1239
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:45,520
I feel like, you know, I'm doing this interview with Brianna, um, uh, in a few

1240
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:52,720
days, show her the proof stardust, burn the bridge, um, we'll see.

1241
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,880
Um, I'm going to try and approach it as unbiased as possible.

1242
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,280
Right.

1243
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:01,200
Um, but, um, obviously there are things here that I can ask her about.

1244
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:01,720
Definitely.

1245
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,800
I'm going to ask her about them.

1246
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:12,280
Um, so, uh, yeah, uh, there's just so much stuff that, that is going on

1247
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:17,520
in this, in this timeline that like, I feel like I could study this for

1248
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,920
like a year and still not understand the entirety of the thing.

1249
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,760
Um, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1250
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,160
Um, Jim's old videos were pretty good.

1251
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,080
Sargon's old videos are pretty good.

1252
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,840
Um, my old videos are pretty good, but the quality on them fucking sucks.

1253
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,240
Um, okay, here we go.

1254
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,080
I think, I think, I think I found it.

1255
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,040
Oh God.

1256
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,480
Yeah, that's right.

1257
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,720
Phil fish's Twitter rant.

1258
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,160
I'm so glad he's gone.

1259
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,240
Let me just give me a second here.

1260
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,240
Let's see.

1261
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,480
Okay.

1262
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:05,960
Oh, that's right.

1263
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,880
The fine young capitalists.

1264
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,800
Do you remember, did you hear what them, that was part of the story.

1265
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,040
I know that it's in the timeline.

1266
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,240
The fine, fine young capitalists are in the timeline.

1267
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,160
Here's here's they were, they were the ones that I think that

1268
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,600
they, they tanked the game jam of.

1269
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,080
This was, this was their story that they posted on, on Reddit.

1270
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,560
I'm going to pull that one up now.

1271
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,640
Oh, I see it here.

1272
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,080
And, okay.

1273
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,360
Right.

1274
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:43,960
Um,

1275
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,320
Oh yeah, someone in your chat just said that the fine young

1276
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,560
capitalists are completely gone.

1277
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:52,800
Oh yeah.

1278
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,360
They've been gone for like five or six years now.

1279
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,840
They just, they just left because fuck.

1280
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,000
Yeah.

1281
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,720
So, uh, if you don't mind, I'm going to read this to the chat.

1282
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,880
It says she fucking docs me ruined a production for women refuse to

1283
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,520
contact us and is currently taking money for a game jam with no start

1284
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,720
date, no location and no judges.

1285
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,240
Okay.

1286
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,200
Here's my story.

1287
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,520
We ran a group that literally said any woman come up with an idea for a

1288
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,480
video game will give you concept art.

1289
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,960
So you can pitch your game and we'll put all the pitches online.

1290
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,040
The internet will vote.

1291
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,840
Uh, the internet will vote on the best one and we'll make that game.

1292
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,480
And give the profits to charity.

1293
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,240
If you get a lot of interest online and wants to make the game on your own,

1294
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,360
you can leave the contest at any time.

1295
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,640
Literally everyone that was in the top five didn't have programming

1296
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,280
experience, so they couldn't make their game on their own.

1297
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,800
She was like, why do you expect women to work for free and make games?

1298
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,120
We said, well, they get 8% of the money as royalties and they just have

1299
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,720
to give an idea other people will make the game and the profits go to charity.

1300
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:56,840
Doesn't matter.

1301
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,600
It's oppressive.

1302
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,280
She started a fucking Twitter storm, crashed our website, got my personal

1303
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,840
information docs, got us banned from Twitter.

1304
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,760
We email reporter.

1305
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,120
What what's up?

1306
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,960
And they're like, duh.

1307
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,720
If duh, if Zoe says it's oppressive, it must be true.

1308
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,360
Maybe you should give her money for rebel jam, which has no start

1309
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,880
date location or any other information, but totally isn't a scam.

1310
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,000
This happens at three, eight, uh, three major, uh, online publications.

1311
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,640
We literally said we'd pay her to consult on future projects and we

1312
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,920
closed down the contest if she would explain to us what is exactly offensive.

1313
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,520
No response, no response at all.

1314
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,600
Unless a reporter contacted her and then she's the victim.

1315
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,040
All this information is fucking online.

1316
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,120
The pitches are online.

1317
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,040
We did everything we said, but no online journalists will publish the story.

1318
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,760
Please vote.

1319
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,560
Even if we don't raise enough money, if, um, if show there's enough of a

1320
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,800
interest, we can get the winner, a grant to make their game.

1321
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,160
I am literally making no money on this contest.

1322
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,440
I just wanted to focus on something other than women being oppressed.

1323
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,560
I wanted to show that they made good games and everyone said, that's not

1324
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,840
what women in games wants to talk about.

1325
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:23,840
Um, so I guess that's their, their perspective, um, regarding the game jam.

1326
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:30,320
Um, and, uh, one thing, let me see here.

1327
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:43,480
Um, I remember seeing fine young capitalists and now the rational Wiki,

1328
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:53,160
and I know you said this is like super slanted, um, it says here, uh, Matthew

1329
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,960
rapper claims on Reddit that Zoe Quinn sabotaged their game jam and doxed

1330
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,280
him without providing any proof.

1331
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:02,040
The claims he made under his username by silly Slater, we deleted and or

1332
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,960
edited later on, um, his accusation seems to be based on a conversation

1333
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,320
with Zoe Quinn from March cop compiled by Metroid composite that was

1334
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,040
apparently settled in private.

1335
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,160
Um,

1336
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:19,480
yeah.

1337
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,560
And then on August 29th to find young capitalist backpedal on their claims.

1338
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,040
Let's see.

1339
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,960
I'm just trying to be as thorough as possible.

1340
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,160
Nope.

1341
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:35,640
It makes sense.

1342
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,600
I'm also, this is all also like old lore for me too.

1343
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,000
Is I don't have to like, look at it to jog my memory.

1344
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,880
I'm pretty sure when it's kind of strange, this is from an era before the trend

1345
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,480
stuff was like really center stage in the left.

1346
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:56,880
So, um, a lot of the, a lot of the feminism of this era was kind of anti-trans, you

1347
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,720
know, they, they still held the opinion that like trans women were male

1348
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,920
infiltrators that wanted to destroy feminism and stuff like that.

1349
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,760
The trans stuff didn't really come about till like 2017.

1350
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:13,960
So, uh, I think, I think they dead name that the main person involved in find

1351
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,200
young capitalists on this, this website.

1352
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:21,400
Because yeah, it says Matthew Rapard and I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure that's a

1353
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:21,800
girl.

1354
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,320
Well, no, no, I mean, I don't get, I don't give a shit, but like, it's, it's just been

1355
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,360
up, it's been up for so long and this is obviously like an old timeline.

1356
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:33,400
So like people haven't edited this in years and back then dead naming was not a

1357
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:33,960
big deal, right?

1358
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,080
No one cared.

1359
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,600
It's just, it's just strange to see how like things have changed.

1360
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:44,120
Um, okay, let's see the poll board gets behind funding the fine young capitalist

1361
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:44,680
crowd funding.

1362
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,080
The fine young capitalist crowd funding campaign.

1363
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,600
They call it operation chemo.

1364
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,760
The crowd funding campaign, the fine young capitalist gets closed.

1365
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,040
They blame it on Zoe Quinn without providing any proof.

1366
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:06,440
Okay.

1367
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:14,040
Well, it looks, it looks like on that image, if that's a true email, the Indiegogo team

1368
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,440
is saying they're doing this for Zoe.

1369
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,160
So this is back when Indiegogo was like at small companies, they could like send out

1370
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,360
impersonal emails like this.

1371
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:23,800
Let's see.

1372
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm trying to find what you're talking about.

1373
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:25,880
Yeah.

1374
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:27,960
Right.

1375
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:28,200
Okay.

1376
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:29,640
Yeah.

1377
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,480
Back from their claim that Zoe Quinn docs are hacking them.

1378
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:31,800
So that's.

1379
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,360
And I'm trying to read this, but.

1380
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,120
Lots of the links are broken and stuff on these old things, eh?

1381
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:38,680
Yeah.

1382
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,320
Yeah, they are.

1383
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,880
Oh, fucking Lego butts.

1384
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,680
Oh my God.

1385
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:48,760
Oh, I'm just like getting brainwaves, man.

1386
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:50,600
Oh, here it is.

1387
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,280
Zoe Quinn didn't understand this project.

1388
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,080
She decided to send some followers our way.

1389
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,200
One of them docs me.

1390
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,720
One of them sent a death threat.

1391
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:03,000
Tons of them called me transphobic and the majority of said the project was exploitative.

1392
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,560
It costed me money, a friend and a sponsor.

1393
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,280
She fucked up.

1394
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,400
I've been treated worse.

1395
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,760
I rarely think about it anymore.

1396
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:14,200
My greatest sin seems to be not pretending it didn't happen.

1397
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:15,720
It happened.

1398
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,080
She didn't know what she was doing.

1399
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,960
Where is that?

1400
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,440
Exactly.

1401
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,200
I'm trying to find these pictures.

1402
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,600
Yeah, it's not a picture.

1403
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,160
The backpedal on their claims link works.

1404
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,360
And so it's from that.

1405
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:30,760
It happened.

1406
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,800
She didn't know what she was doing.

1407
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,960
Apparently she's not an omniscient God.

1408
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,760
Except from heaven to purge the earth from human gamers.

1409
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:39,480
She's just some woman that wants people to make games.

1410
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,720
We wrote the statement slash piece for you with her specifically so that she could go

1411
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,760
to PAX and point to it if anyone asked how we felt about her.

1412
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:53,800
So they're saying that she directed followers our way and one of them docs me, but she herself

1413
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:54,840
didn't docs me.

1414
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,120
I still can't find that.

1415
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:01,320
So on August 29th, it says the final capitalist backpedal on their claims at Zoe Quinn docs

1416
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:02,120
to hack them.

1417
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:06,520
When I go to that site, it takes me to a tumbler.

1418
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,360
Oh, right, right, right.

1419
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,240
No, no, no.

1420
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,120
I was looking at a different page.

1421
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:10,600
Sorry.

1422
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,100
Yeah.

1423
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,000
Right.

1424
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,880
Find young capitalists are apologizing for getting punched in the face.

1425
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,440
Right.

1426
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:18,940
Okay.

1427
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,320
I remember this now.

1428
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,040
I remember this now.

1429
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:28,540
Yeah.

1430
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,040
I remember this now.

1431
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:37,880
So yeah, Zoe Quinn showed up and apologized to them and they kind of patched things up

1432
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:46,680
because this is like, this is this is during while it was blowing up, but it hadn't gotten

1433
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,960
to its peak yet.

1434
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,680
And I think the fine young capitalist, like they weren't in this for a culture war.

1435
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,120
They just wanted to do their project, right?

1436
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:52,920
They didn't.

1437
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,720
So Zoe Quinn was going to come to them and apologize to them and say, listen, it's not

1438
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,040
my fault.

1439
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,160
They were going to accept the apology.

1440
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,400
I remember I remember Zoe Quinn doing this a lot.

1441
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,640
She was like running around in people's DMS trying to put out like every single fire that

1442
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,200
she could lots of like, oh, it wasn't really me.

1443
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,080
Oh, it was somebody else.

1444
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:11,960
Oh, I'm sorry.

1445
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,080
I didn't direct this harassment.

1446
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:13,480
I didn't.

1447
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,280
I didn't.

1448
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:19,320
And it's like, okay, you know, sometimes sometimes your fans just kind of do what they're going

1449
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,360
to do without your input.

1450
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,720
You know, I've experienced that.

1451
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,200
I'm sure like like like Sargon's experience.

1452
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,320
I'm sure Destiny's experienced that, you know, like sometimes it just happens, right?

1453
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:29,720
So that's definitely a reasonable excuse.

1454
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:37,560
But like considering her behavior before and after gamer gate where like this kind of this

1455
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:44,600
pattern of behavior from her, um, I don't think that like she docs anyone, but I also

1456
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:49,160
don't think that she actually cared if one of her followers doc someone, I don't believe

1457
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:54,440
it personally, just because like, as a gamer gate went on, we looked into like the drama

1458
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,600
from that she got into before gamer gate.

1459
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,440
There's a drama that she's been in since gamer gate and there's been like a consistent pattern

1460
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:07,000
of behavior with this woman where it's been like, I'm not going to do anything about anything,

1461
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:12,600
but you know, it, it, you know how like, you know how sometimes people will just like post

1462
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:17,800
someone's name and address without an actual like threat of violence attached, but you

1463
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,120
know, they're kind of like hoping someone's going to do something ridiculous.

1464
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,600
This is like an on what Zoe Quinn is like an online variant of that where she'll like,

1465
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:30,280
she'll go right up to the edge of actually saying something wrong, and then do that consistently.

1466
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:38,280
So, um, so what drama was she involved in before gamer gate?

1467
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:38,760
Do you know?

1468
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:46,680
Oh, God, it's there was something about her, she moved to Toronto to avoid

1469
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:52,120
some sort of like a divorce settlement or something because she was married.

1470
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,080
And she actually like fled to Canada for a year or two.

1471
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,880
I don't remember that the full details and then like basically once the legal

1472
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,440
troubles kind of died down, she moved back to the States.

1473
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:09,560
She just has like a history of these really toxic personal relationships where she's using people.

1474
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,080
Aaron's only like one of many.

1475
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:14,620
Yeah.

1476
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:15,660
Yeah.

1477
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,800
This me I can look this up.

1478
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,520
Let's see.

1479
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,020
Zoe.

1480
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:23,660
Jesus.

1481
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:27,000
Is this it?

1482
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,720
Yeah, here we go.

1483
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:34,520
So, Brianna, you said Brianna Woon and Anita Sarkeesian kind of inserted themselves into

1484
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:35,640
the gamer gate stuff.

1485
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:41,080
I'm assuming by like, posting something in response to it.

1486
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:48,840
Um, yeah, basically, they like they saw like the, the culture war kick up, and they started

1487
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:52,440
like commenting on it and saying I've been harassed to I've been harassed to give me give

1488
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,800
me some attention guys.

1489
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,960
Like there's there's a lot of that happening from those two.

1490
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,720
Okay, yeah.

1491
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,560
Here's right.

1492
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,200
It was um, I think.

1493
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,040
I see it here.

1494
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:11,240
Brianna Woon lead developer at giant space cat studios decides to make a joke Twitter

1495
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,600
account to mock gamer gators without mentioning them at all.

1496
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,480
90 minutes past she reports being targeted by harassment.

1497
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,440
I think I found the Toronto stuff with Zoe.

1498
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,080
It's like another sexual assault allegation that ended up not panning out.

1499
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,560
There's a bunch of those in her past.

1500
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,080
So I think that's what this is.

1501
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,600
This is like a research stream now.

1502
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,800
I just ancient lore.

1503
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,000
Sorry.

1504
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,920
No, no, I enjoy this sort of thing.

1505
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:39,420
Yeah.

1506
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,420
Okay.

1507
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,440
I think it's safe.

1508
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:44,920
No, thanks.

1509
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,760
I think I'm safe.

1510
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,640
No, thanks to you.

1511
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,680
Do not tweet at me again.

1512
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,680
We will no longer be doing interviews with blank.

1513
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:58,040
We have creator of they bleed pixels expressing his disgust for an individual who assaulted

1514
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,960
Zoe Quinn at a gaming event.

1515
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,360
The individual is respected amongst the gaming scene.

1516
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:06,840
The individual explains himself, but they bleed pixels doesn't believe him.

1517
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:22,200
Yeah, it looks like the black text is like what's explaining what's happening here since

1518
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,640
a lot of it's been lost to time.

1519
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:25,420
Yeah.

1520
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,420
See here.

1521
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:35,080
So then this Miguel says drunk isn't an excuse for behavior.

1522
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,200
I was still in cold sober.

1523
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,040
I saw how you acted and what you did.

1524
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,240
Now please leave me alone.

1525
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,840
Blank asking help usually requires you to say things rather than silently brooding.

1526
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,720
Also doesn't require you to grab and injure Zoe.

1527
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,920
And then this explanation text says Jesus does fucked up.

1528
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,920
What would compel someone to act that way?

1529
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,960
Rooting silently and then continuing to grab at Zoe's arm.

1530
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:56,460
Weird.

1531
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,160
Which I assume is like sarcastic.

1532
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,120
Miguel says, oh, awesome.

1533
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:08,200
Now he's giving my number out to his friends so that they can try and harass me too.

1534
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:08,920
Thanks, asshole.

1535
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,160
Weird how these people who harass Zoe always do it by phone.

1536
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,480
So there's not really any proof of it ever happening.

1537
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,920
It's almost like a wizard did it.

1538
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,000
It's okay means blank is sorry.

1539
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,400
He got drunk and assaulted Zoe.

1540
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,880
We can forgive him because he's a dude centric.

1541
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,040
He's in a dude centered biz, right?

1542
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,160
What does this even mean?

1543
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:35,480
This is how much he's prepared to defend Zoe and extrapolate the night's events for the cause.

1544
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:49,400
I think it's going to be a common issue as all local indie communities grow.

1545
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,160
We need to set a precedent, not cool.

1546
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,920
The bleed pixels guy probably didn't realize how much Zoe was lying.

1547
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,560
His behavior is really what we'd want good people to do.

1548
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,840
They see what they believe to be a person being harassed and they step in and help.

1549
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,240
Unfortunately, Zoe was using the nice events to spin this particular individual as a creep buck.

1550
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:14,680
Really, he was a person Zoe was until recently involved with counting on a friend for help.

1551
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,080
We also see here some of the rewards of white knighting.

1552
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:22,200
It's got to feel great to have people congratulate you just for being a good person, right?

1553
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,160
Okay.

1554
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:42,280
Months later, the Toronto indie scene for the most part found out what Zoe's true nature really was.

1555
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,640
She wasn't welcome there anymore.

1556
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:48,520
She'd end up moving to San Francisco and living with Patricia Hernandez who promised to make her big.

1557
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,760
Zoe now views Patricia as a hack who never made good on her promise.

1558
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,400
Zoe and this individual had a brief fling.

1559
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,000
He wanted more and Zoe didn't.

1560
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,400
They decided to break it off but were still friends.

1561
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:06,200
They both attended the event and when this individual got the news,

1562
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:11,960
he thought Zoe would still be a friend he could trust to talk to and have some support.

1563
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:17,400
He kept grabbing her arm trying to beg her to just listen because he was probably disintegrating internally.

1564
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,120
Kind of a dick move to not just leave her alone

1565
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:23,880
but he had been drinking and probably received some of the worst news of his life.

1566
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:27,720
Instead, Zoe used it as an opportunity to make him look like a creep.

1567
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:32,920
He got too close and actually wanted something meaningful so she used this as a clean out.

1568
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:37,960
She said he was stalking and harassing her and essentially tried to ruin his reputation.

1569
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,920
He kept his distance from her since that night.

1570
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:44,840
Zoe would use this event as a so brave story about herself

1571
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,960
saying her boss came on to her and dislocated her shoulder.

1572
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,520
She was never employed by him, her shoulder was never dislocated,

1573
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:55,880
and days later her friends saw her doing manual work with no discomfort.

1574
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,240
Okay, so this is what happened prior to gamergate.

1575
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:03,740
Yeah.

1576
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,100
Yeah.

1577
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,040
And there is at least a couple other stories,

1578
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,680
but I mean they're going to require digging up in in the same thing.

1579
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,360
Yeah, wow.

1580
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:16,120
Um, another thing that happened was not your shield.

1581
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:16,920
Did you hear about that?

1582
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,480
I did not hear about that.

1583
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,200
I'm so sorry.

1584
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,600
I'm making you explain everything.

1585
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:23,100
That's fine.

1586
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:31,720
There was a claim for a while that the only people involved in gamergate were straight white men,

1587
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,240
and that that's all it was.

1588
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:38,200
And in response, a shit ton of people post pictures of themselves saying that no,

1589
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:39,880
they were women and they were also pro gamergate.

1590
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:45,240
They just weren't part of the, you know, the game journo indie clique.

1591
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:51,480
They weren't in the club, you know, this image went viral on September 2nd.

1592
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:57,560
Um, I still remember like half of these girls,

1593
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,600
because it's 10 years later, they've all kind of like gone their separate ways.

1594
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:06,600
I think shoe on head even posted one of these, one of these not your shield images.

1595
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,120
Um, some of them have gone like far, right.

1596
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,560
Some of them have gone far left.

1597
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,440
Um, a few of them have left the internet entirely.

1598
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,560
Some of them just don't make content anymore.

1599
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:26,440
But basically a lot of these people, um, a lot of these people who were pro gamergate,

1600
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,680
weren't just straight white men.

1601
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:34,120
And there's a comic that you see sometimes where it's like a black woman who's going

1602
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:39,240
to like explain something and then a white woman like puts her hand over the black woman's mouth

1603
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,280
and says, you're oppressed.

1604
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,160
Let me explain that came out of not your shield.

1605
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,520
That was first drawn for not your shield.

1606
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:45,800
Okay.

1607
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,840
Okay, interesting.

1608
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:57,640
Um, there's also Milo falsely accusing Zoe Quinn of embezzling money from their game.

1609
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,920
And then accusing of lying about her police report.

1610
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,680
Milo falsely abuses.

1611
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,280
I'm always going to embezzling money.

1612
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:08,920
What was this?

1613
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:20,680
If you've donated money to I've Fred, why does that charity say you haven't?

1614
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,840
How much money has depression quest raised?

1615
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:30,200
What percentage of that money have you donated to, um, to date to I've Fred?

1616
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:35,720
Oh, I see what's going on.

1617
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,520
Okay.

1618
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:36,840
Okay.

1619
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:42,360
So Zoe Quinn said that, um, the proceeds from her game depression quest, at least a portion

1620
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:45,160
of them will be donated to I've Fred, which is a depression charity.

1621
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,040
And Milo called her up, asked for a comment.

1622
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,000
Zoe hung up on him.

1623
01:08:50,200 --> 01:09:00,120
Um, I've Fred confirmed that Zoe, that no one had donated to, uh, to them from this

1624
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:00,840
game.

1625
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,520
Um, the issue is depression quest is a free game.

1626
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:05,880
Yeah.

1627
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,800
There's no, there's no profits to be made.

1628
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,080
So I guess Zoe Quinn technically did donate a portion of all of her profits, which is

1629
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,280
a portion of zero.

1630
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,960
So it's not a false statement.

1631
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:15,160
It's just kind of a misleading one.

1632
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:16,200
Yeah.

1633
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:23,480
Um, however, even though you could interpret this as Milo being wrong, you can interpret

1634
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:28,440
this as Zoe being sneaky, whatever, even though, even if you say that this story didn't happen,

1635
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,880
Zoe did later embezzle money for a different game after gamer gate.

1636
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,640
And that's not going to be improved in this timeline.

1637
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,120
Cause she did it like three years later, but she did embezzle money for a game.

1638
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,000
Yeah.

1639
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:44,440
There was like, uh, do you know the room, the terrible movie, the room?

1640
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,240
Yeah.

1641
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:46,040
Yeah.

1642
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:50,600
Remember the guy that played Mark with like the ginger beard, that guy?

1643
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,320
Yeah.

1644
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:55,960
She hired that guy to do an FMV game where he was the star.

1645
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:00,360
She raised a shit ton of money and then she just never put it out.

1646
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,840
And whenever you ask her, she's like, yeah, I spent all the money.

1647
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,160
Sorry.

1648
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,280
She just admits it.

1649
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:04,440
Yeah.

1650
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,400
There's no more money.

1651
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,120
Really?

1652
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:06,440
Wow.

1653
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,480
Um, okay.

1654
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,000
So I'm going to find that.

1655
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:13,320
Hold on.

1656
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,840
This is a post gamer gate drama.

1657
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,000
So it's, let's see.

1658
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,200
Let me find it.

1659
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:26,760
Come on.

1660
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,080
This was back in 2018.

1661
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,280
There's like layers.

1662
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:35,720
So you have to like keep digging down.

1663
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:37,720
Yeah.

1664
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,400
So we quit an FMV game, no info since over six months.

1665
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,000
Come on.

1666
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,640
So we Quinn steals $85,000 from gullible Kickstarters.

1667
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:05,000
Give me something more concrete than just a, uh, a forum post talking about it.

1668
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:09,960
Will this give us something?

1669
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,160
Yeah, here we go.

1670
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,200
Here's an article.

1671
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,160
Uh, kick scams.

1672
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:24,440
Yep.

1673
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,280
They just, they cover Kickstarter scams.

1674
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,560
She was obvious from the name, right?

1675
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:28,760
Yeah.

1676
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,080
Project tingler kickstarted in the butt.

1677
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,760
So Quinn and Chuck tingle FMV game.

1678
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:36,520
Okay.

1679
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:44,120
Um, although she continues to solicit PayPal donations for the, for development

1680
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:47,480
Quinn's Kickstarter account has not been accessed since April, 2018.

1681
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:56,280
Um, project tingler has yet to leave the pre-alpha stage of development.

1682
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:04,760
Um, yeah, it raised $15,000 beyond its original Kickstarter goal and promises

1683
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,440
of early access and sneak peaks.

1684
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:13,240
Um, updates have become increasingly rare questions and concerns from backers

1685
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,600
are routinely neglected for periods up to and exceeding six months.

1686
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:21,000
Um, uh, let's see.

1687
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,280
Twitter messages to lead developers, Zoe Quinn and project manager,

1688
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,120
John E. Warren remain unanswered.

1689
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,360
Despite both being active users of the platform.

1690
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:38,920
Um, author chunk Chuck tingle, who's fictional universe project tingler set

1691
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:42,520
has responded with hostility to those exasperated by the lack of communication.

1692
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,920
Um, yep.

1693
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,360
Um, the LDR is still working on it just slower because I ran out of money

1694
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,760
a long time ago and had to get day jobs.

1695
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,760
Also, I have been working on ways to bring on some assistance with finishing it.

1696
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,280
Also don't yell at Chuck about it.

1697
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,720
Shipping the game is on me.

1698
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,800
Um, Hey, and then.

1699
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,480
Oh, I see.

1700
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:15,320
This is a response to the, yeah, the, the, she, these are two tweets that she

1701
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:21,000
sent as time went on regarding where the money went in the second one.

1702
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,040
She just says ran out of money.

1703
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:22,600
Sorry.

1704
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,320
Ran out of money a long time ago.

1705
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,680
Not cool with asking people to work for free, got a day job to start crawling

1706
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:32,760
out of debt and in a place where I can properly finish it, this is the day job.

1707
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,240
I'm not sure.

1708
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:33,800
I'm not sure.

1709
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,360
I'm not sure.

1710
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:38,200
And in a place where I can properly finish it, this is the day job.

1711
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:46,040
Uh, the issue ultimately is, is while she's posting stuff like this,

1712
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,040
she's also posting stuff like this.

1713
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,680
And so people are saying, Hey, we're donating all this money to you.

1714
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,720
And you're saying that you ran out of money to actually finish the game.

1715
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,640
Where are you getting the money to go on these trips and do it and do these things?

1716
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,440
Time to stop being bitter about the people trying to stop my joy and bad

1717
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:12,520
faith and go back to appreciating the fact that I get to be too busy with

1718
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:16,120
making cool shit that I love to completely goof off in Tokyo.

1719
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,880
One awesome problem I get to have, just like the awesome problem of the

1720
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:24,280
ryokan owner telling me she had to swap out the yukata in my room for the

1721
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,520
big booby yukata instead, bless her.

1722
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:28,520
Okay.

1723
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:29,880
Yeah.

1724
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:30,200
Oops.

1725
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:36,680
Um, yeah, so basically it's been years and years and years.

1726
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,520
A bunch of money has just vanished.

1727
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:39,960
There seems to be no accountability.

1728
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,320
So it's, it's pretty, it's pretty clear where it went.

1729
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,840
This is like the, where did, where did all Keflez's money go, guys?

1730
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,440
It's kind of the same thing, you know?

1731
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,560
Yeah, yeah.

1732
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,680
Um, wow.

1733
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:53,000
Okay.

1734
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:57,720
This is, um, this is really good going through like, oh, clearly slanted,

1735
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,880
um, timeline and like, and getting your take on these things since you

1736
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,560
have like a different perspective.

1737
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,440
Um, yeah, yeah.

1738
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,480
Um, so it's very clearly slanted.

1739
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:15,320
And yes, so Milo also accused me of falsely of lying about a police report.

1740
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,360
I want to see what that link is.

1741
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,200
Falsely of lying about a police report.

1742
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,320
I want to see what that link is.

1743
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,520
Oh, that, I think that link's dead now.

1744
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,560
Whatever it was, it's not leading to anything anymore.

1745
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,840
Um, my listeners and Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian get to debunk.

1746
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:43,160
Um, you can see if I can, uh, the debunking is that Sarkeesian,

1747
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:47,720
her case is being actually handled by the FBI.

1748
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,520
So, um,

1749
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,240
okay, let's see.

1750
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:03,240
Okay.

1751
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,120
Is this it?

1752
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:04,360
Okay.

1753
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:04,440
Yeah.

1754
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,800
Cause that link is, is dead.

1755
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:10,280
It looks like, so this is from during the initial days of gamer gate where

1756
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,440
Anita claimed that she was driven out of her house.

1757
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:18,680
Um, by trolls posting, you know, her address to her or something.

1758
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,400
Um, it's,

1759
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,880
uh, that's not the debunked part.

1760
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:37,000
The debunked part is like Milo tweeting that he talked with, um,

1761
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,440
that he talked with SFPD and they say that the Sarkeesian case is being dealt with by the FBI.

1762
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:42,680
Yeah.

1763
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:47,960
That's this image here, which is Milo's old Milo and Mike Cernovich is old.

1764
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:48,440
Oh yeah.

1765
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:49,400
I don't know if you knew this.

1766
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:51,400
Mike Cernovich got his start in gamer gate too.

1767
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,320
Oh really?

1768
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:53,560
Yep.

1769
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,560
Man.

1770
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,040
Okay.

1771
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,960
I haven't, this is going to be a bit of a side story.

1772
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,040
I haven't heard of Mike Cernovich since gamer gate.

1773
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,000
I know he's been floating around.

1774
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,920
He's been like, he wrote the gorilla mindset.

1775
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:07,240
He's been selling like the gorilla drugs to like get people to they're like

1776
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,360
caffeine enhancers or something.

1777
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:12,040
I don't fucking know what they are, but like he's, he's kind of tried to hop on the,

1778
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:15,320
um, the manosphere train, right?

1779
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:16,520
Man.

1780
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:21,320
I did, I did a video on, um, on Andrew Tate, I think two days ago, just like a,

1781
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:25,560
an update on some of the things because, um, you know who Nick Monroe is?

1782
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:27,000
I don't.

1783
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:27,960
Who's that?

1784
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,000
Do you know crab crawler?

1785
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:30,680
Yeah.

1786
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,160
On Twitter?

1787
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,280
Yeah, I know.

1788
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,240
That's a secret account.

1789
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,920
Don't tell anyone that's Nick Monroe.

1790
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,760
Nick Monroe is an investigative journalist.

1791
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:42,760
And he first got big live tweeting some trials four or five years back.

1792
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:43,800
And I've talked to him a bunch of times.

1793
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,360
He's a good guy.

1794
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,560
Uh, but his whole thing is like deep dives, gamer gate style, deep dives.

1795
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:55,160
And he, I, I basically did a video, uh, crediting him and putting all of his

1796
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,480
research into, into video format.

1797
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,280
But he did a big ass thread where he discovered that Mike Cernovich was in

1798
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:09,560
Andrew Tate's war room, selling his, selling his gorilla drugs to Andrew

1799
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,160
Tate and other people there.

1800
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,600
That's wild.

1801
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,040
I think I remember that actually.

1802
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,400
That's wild.

1803
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:15,640
Yeah.

1804
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:20,840
And so when Andrew Tate says, yeah, I make my girls do 16 hour days in front

1805
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:25,080
of the camera, a crab crawler was like, listen, are you giving them the gorilla

1806
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,040
drugs to keep them going?

1807
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,400
Like what's going on here?

1808
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:27,720
What is.

1809
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:29,800
Wow.

1810
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:31,080
Yeah.

1811
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:36,040
So you just outed a secret on stream.

1812
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:39,640
Oh, what that, uh, that Nick Monroe is crab crawler.

1813
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,440
Yeah.

1814
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:45,080
I think it's like Sammy public knowledge at this point.

1815
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:46,280
Okay.

1816
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:47,160
Wow.

1817
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,360
He was like perma band from Twitter for a while for unearthing the wrong

1818
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:54,920
secrets for live tweeting about the wrong trials, but, uh, he came back and

1819
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:58,040
now that Elon's back, no one cares anymore, you know, now that Elon's in

1820
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:58,680
control of things.

1821
01:18:59,400 --> 01:18:59,800
Yeah.

1822
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:08,520
No, I still see people getting like wrecked by Twitter, like TOS or whatever.

1823
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,840
Um, yeah, I was banned for a week.

1824
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:12,520
Yeah.

1825
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:12,920
Yeah.

1826
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,840
What for, what did you get banned for?

1827
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:22,440
Um, I said that being trans was a mental illness and because it's gender

1828
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,840
dysphoria and transitioning is the proper medical treatment for the illness.

1829
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,680
And if you try to make being trans and aesthetic and not a mental illness,

1830
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,320
you're going to completely remove the medical side of it.

1831
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,400
And now suddenly a bunch of trans people are going to be left without their

1832
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:37,880
healthcare.

1833
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:43,080
So you can, you guys need to chill the fuck down, but you guys, you guys need

1834
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,440
to calm down with this shit because you're, you're ruining things for trans

1835
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:46,840
people.

1836
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:48,520
And that got me banned for a week.

1837
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:49,800
Wow.

1838
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:51,800
I can't believe that got you banned.

1839
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,080
Yep.

1840
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:54,200
It's true too.

1841
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:57,720
I know it's, I know it's kind of spicy, but it's true.

1842
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:03,400
Like, I mean, you know that you have to argue then what is the justification

1843
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,480
of like giving, um, like medical treatment to all these trans people with

1844
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:08,920
just an aesthetic that you can claim.

1845
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:09,880
Yeah.

1846
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:10,440
Yeah.

1847
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:13,320
There's a clip that I use over and over and maybe I can actually find it for

1848
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:13,480
you.

1849
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:13,880
Hold on.

1850
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:25,880
If I can't find it for you, I'll upload it because fuck.

1851
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:26,360
It's funny.

1852
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,040
Is this it?

1853
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,240
No, it's not it.

1854
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:29,560
Fuck.

1855
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,880
Come on internet.

1856
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:35,560
Help me out.

1857
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:49,880
Oh, maybe I can't.

1858
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,520
God damn it.

1859
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:51,320
Yeah.

1860
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,680
I wonder if it's small enough that I can just send it to you over for

1861
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,160
discord.

1862
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,840
A lot of people tuned in for your gamer gate summary.

1863
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:05,880
Really?

1864
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,640
What's the numbers looking like?

1865
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,320
There's like 155 on YouTube right now.

1866
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:11,960
Oh, nice.

1867
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:12,840
Hi guys.

1868
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,240
What's up?

1869
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,640
Yeah, I'll upload it like privately.

1870
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:24,600
I'll set it to, I use this clip so much in my videos because it's so ridiculous.

1871
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,640
It's one of those stock clips.

1872
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,960
I just keep around whenever I have to bring it up.

1873
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:32,440
Okay.

1874
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,680
Uh, unlisted.

1875
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:35,400
This should be good.

1876
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,520
Everybody's saying, um, hi dev to you.

1877
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:40,280
Hello.

1878
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:44,440
What was it?

1879
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:46,440
I'm here for dev.

1880
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,320
I'm a fan of him.

1881
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,280
Yeah, I'm a fan too.

1882
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:49,400
He's pretty cool.

1883
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,120
Oh, well, thank you.

1884
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:51,880
Nice to meet you.

1885
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:52,840
Sundance.

1886
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,640
Excuse me.

1887
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,520
What did you call me?

1888
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,320
Is your name Sundance?

1889
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,520
It is not Sundance.

1890
01:21:59,080 --> 01:21:59,720
Okay.

1891
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:00,280
Watch this.

1892
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:03,240
Okay.

1893
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:04,840
It would be the.

1894
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:12,040
It's a minute, so I'll just kind of sit back and.

1895
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:13,400
Okay.

1896
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,920
So, okay.

1897
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,840
So you're going to have to explain to me because I didn't get it.

1898
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:19,320
I'm sorry.

1899
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:20,520
Oh, no.

1900
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,120
No, I didn't.

1901
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,880
Well, let me, let me play it again.

1902
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:24,120
Okay.

1903
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,880
It might take me, it might take me a minute.

1904
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:33,720
I'm sorry.

1905
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:41,080
It's just like a, for me, it's just like, okay.

1906
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:45,480
Uh, you know, typical retarded take, but yeah.

1907
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:45,720
Yes.

1908
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:45,960
Yes.

1909
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,560
I mean, it is just a typical retarded take.

1910
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:47,800
Yeah.

1911
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:55,000
But if you want like a single sound clip that completely demolishes the entire, the entire

1912
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,360
leftist view on what being trans is, it's this one.

1913
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:04,520
If gender actually is just an aesthetic as she claims, then there's no reason for any

1914
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:06,920
of it to be covered in terms of medical costs.

1915
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,080
There's no reason for anyone to respect it.

1916
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,600
You know, like, why would you?

1917
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:14,600
Cause you shouldn't respect it any more than you would respect someone's choice of clothing,

1918
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,120
which is sometimes inappropriate.

1919
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,320
And sometimes it's not part of your identity anymore.

1920
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:25,640
You know, like this, this one line of logic destroys everything that trans people have

1921
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:29,160
been trying to build for pretty much ever.

1922
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:30,760
Yeah.

1923
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:36,440
So I keep this in my, I keep this in my back pocket and I'm like, listen, if I ever need

1924
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,600
to like pull out, Oh, here's something retarded.

1925
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,280
I have it ready to go.

1926
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:41,320
Yeah.

1927
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:43,000
Yeah.

1928
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,840
It's, it's pretty retarded.

1929
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:51,720
It's up there with, I think I remember seeing this actually and just being like, okay, really?

1930
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:52,520
Yeah.

1931
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:53,400
Yeah.

1932
01:24:59,480 --> 01:24:59,800
Wow.

1933
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:06,520
So I'm, I guess I'm going to have to like look through the more of this gamergate stuff,

1934
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,280
but like, what were you talking about before?

1935
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:08,600
Yeah.

1936
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:09,400
Hold on.

1937
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:09,640
Yeah.

1938
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:13,000
Jesse single gets involved in this and writes a,

1939
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:19,000
you know, writes a, writes a, an article about it.

1940
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:30,360
Mike Cernovich goes after a nil dash in the name of gamergate for no apparent reason.

1941
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,320
Dash has never written about gamergate or video games,

1942
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:35,560
but has a history of Cernovich stalking him.

1943
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,680
What is that?

1944
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:37,000
Sure.

1945
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:37,320
Let's see.

1946
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,080
Mike Cernovich goes after, huh?

1947
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,040
Who's a nil dash?

1948
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,080
I have no idea.

1949
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:47,880
Yeah.

1950
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,640
This, I don't know what this part is at all.

1951
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,760
So this is all news to me.

1952
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,880
I mean, I'm not surprised that Mike Cernovich ended up being kind of a grifter.

1953
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:00,920
Yeah.

1954
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:02,120
Let's see.

1955
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:03,160
He goes after him.

1956
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,640
Um, I don't know what this is, but.

1957
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:10,120
Let's see what this is.

1958
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:27,640
When the gamergate mob targeted a nil dash for no reason.

1959
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:32,840
SJWs are bullies.

1960
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,400
I hate bullies.

1961
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,680
How do you handle a mob of bullies?

1962
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:36,440
You single them out one by one.

1963
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,840
Docs, Docs, Docs, Docs, Docs.

1964
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:47,320
Oh, someone in your chat quickly asked, isn't the dear gender weirdo on some sort of mod

1965
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,040
team for Twitch?

1966
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,200
No, there's actually two dear gender weirdos.

1967
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:53,720
Fucking hell.

1968
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,640
There's multiples of them.

1969
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:55,880
Yes.

1970
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:57,400
There's a herd.

1971
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:58,840
Yeah.

1972
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:00,600
Well, there's two.

1973
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,080
I don't know if two makes a herd, but maybe.

1974
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,040
Yeah.

1975
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:09,560
If believing the first amendment in due process makes me a sociopath, then I'm guilty as charged.

1976
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,680
Aaron is a nice guy.

1977
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,200
I, on the other hand, am not so nice.

1978
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,280
I play a lot meaner than SJWs.

1979
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:17,320
Just wait till I issue subpoenas and start doxing.

1980
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:18,200
Holy shit.

1981
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,240
Mike Cernovich is like fucking unhinged in these tweets.

1982
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:22,040
Yeah.

1983
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:24,200
Back in the old days.

1984
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,400
Now that this is a story that completely went by me, I have no clue that this happened.

1985
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:54,120
I don't know.

1986
01:27:54,120 --> 01:28:00,120
It looks like gamer gate ended up just being a massive W for the pro gamer gators.

1987
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:08,760
I mean, kind of, kind of not, because if you look at the state of video game development

1988
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:12,680
right now, it's certainly more woke than it was back then.

1989
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,280
And they didn't want that.

1990
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,840
So I think a lot of them view it as like a massive loss.

1991
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:22,120
You know, none of the people that they discovered to be, I guess with the exception of Phil

1992
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:26,280
Fish, none of the people that were discovered to have been doing anything wrong ever got

1993
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:27,080
punished for it.

1994
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:28,120
They never lost their jobs.

1995
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,880
They never lost their positions.

1996
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,160
They in fact got promotions.

1997
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:36,680
You know, Nathan Grayson moved on from Kotaku to the Washington Post.

1998
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:39,320
I think like Steven Toledo.

1999
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:40,680
I think he moved on to somewhere else too.

2000
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,280
Like basically their careers kept going.

2001
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:49,080
A few indie developers that like some of the worst people kind of had their careers collapse.

2002
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:50,840
Like nobody pays attention to Zoe Quinn anymore.

2003
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:51,640
No one cares.

2004
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:54,680
Nobody pays attention to Nia Sarkeesian anymore.

2005
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,040
You know, like her channel is dead.

2006
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:00,280
It gets like it gets like 100 views a video with like a million subs or something like

2007
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,000
it's a dead channel.

2008
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:08,200
Brianna Wu, I think is only relevant because she stopped doing game development and tried

2009
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,480
to run for office.

2010
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:11,800
So she completely jumped into a different sphere.

2011
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,240
So I think she kind of survived by just getting out of gaming.

2012
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:25,160
Yeah, like if you pull up what gets promoted on, let's say the latest Nintendo Direct or

2013
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:31,640
the latest Sony State of Play, what's pushed to the front of the websites, what's pushed

2014
01:29:31,640 --> 01:29:34,360
to the front of these news outlets.

2015
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:39,960
You know, it's all stuff that gamer gators would have hated to see 10 years ago.

2016
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,040
So I don't think that they view it as a win.

2017
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:44,940
Really?

2018
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:48,200
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

2019
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:52,200
I feel like, isn't that just, couldn't that just be like the natural progression of things

2020
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:58,920
as we get into more like globalized multicultural, you know, society, like things just naturally

2021
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:02,360
get more like that.

2022
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:09,160
Maybe it's not necessarily like a loss on gamer gate's side.

2023
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:12,520
Are you doing the whole Cthulhu swims left thing?

2024
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,240
I don't know what that is.

2025
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:15,800
Oh, hold on.

2026
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:19,320
It's an expression.

2027
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:20,700
Right.

2028
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,600
It's from Moldbug.

2029
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,400
Cthulhu may swim slowly, but he only swims left.

2030
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,440
You said Moldbug was based yesterday.

2031
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:29,560
I remember that comment.

2032
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:35,560
Well, okay, there were, I only read a little bit of some of the stuff you were saying.

2033
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:40,120
Like, I'm not saying he, I said he had some base, some base takes.

2034
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,640
I didn't say he himself was based.

2035
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:42,140
Okay.

2036
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:45,400
So Stardust is going on the Neo reactionary arc, guys.

2037
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,120
It's going to happen.

2038
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:48,280
It's going to happen.

2039
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,640
Um, the idea basically, you know what?

2040
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:55,800
I think a better way to, okay, hold on.

2041
01:30:55,800 --> 01:31:04,840
Robert conquest, three laws of politics, which law was it?

2042
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:07,740
Which one?

2043
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:11,960
Um, what was the intended director could talk to?

2044
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,280
Which one were you saying people would hate what they see?

2045
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:15,480
Hold on a second.

2046
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,880
Um, right.

2047
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:22,440
Any organization, not explicitly right-wing sooner or later becomes left-wing.

2048
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:27,000
That's the underlying idea behind Cthulhu swims left.

2049
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,360
So basically like culture is always progressing leftward over time.

2050
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:31,560
It's not progressing rightward.

2051
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:36,360
I don't think that that's necessarily true because the Neo conservative win of Reagan

2052
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:39,320
and Thatcher in the eighties kind of proved that decisively wrong.

2053
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:43,480
You know, there are the flagging economies in the west of the 70 that were kind of bogged

2054
01:31:43,480 --> 01:31:47,800
down by a lot of social spending, got revitalized by new conservatism.

2055
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:52,280
So it's, I don't think this is a true statement that things always moved left-leaning, but

2056
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:55,320
they've certainly moved left-leaning consistently in the past 30 years.

2057
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,480
And I think some people just don't like that.

2058
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:02,680
Well, yeah, I'm not trying to say that like things always have to move left-leaning, but

2059
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:09,720
my more of what I would be saying is like, we live in a increasingly globalized society.

2060
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:14,040
Like, you know, globalization is, you know, very widespread.

2061
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:20,840
Culture, you know, has been exported to a lot of different places and we're very multicultural

2062
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:23,480
society now as a whole.

2063
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:27,080
So like us being a multicultural society.

2064
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:32,200
Now, I don't know what, like, was it Kotaku you said that people would not like what's

2065
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:35,080
being shown on the front page or whatever?

2066
01:32:38,360 --> 01:32:39,480
I think so, yes.

2067
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:43,080
Like that's what gamers would not like if they went to like the front page of, of even

2068
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:45,560
maybe even steam, not, not, not steam is pretty impartial still.

2069
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:50,760
But if you go to the front page of Kotaku or polygon, I think the games that are featured

2070
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:55,480
or the political slants that are pushed people who were in gamer gate, if they could like

2071
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:56,840
see the future, they probably wouldn't like it.

2072
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:58,440
Yeah.

2073
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:04,440
I mean, I guess if it's, if it's like, I don't know, like, I guess I was just thinking more

2074
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,640
about like representation in video games and stuff like that.

2075
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:12,120
But if it's just like straight up, like left wing, like politics that are being pushed,

2076
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:16,440
then yeah, I could see people not liking that and seeing it kind of like a failure.

2077
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:22,840
The thing is like gaming was kind of unique because people never had a problem with representation

2078
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:23,560
in it before.

2079
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:26,920
You know, if you go back to the 90s, you go back to the Super Nintendo, the Nintendo 64,

2080
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:31,160
the PlayStation one, you could find black characters, no problem.

2081
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,320
Female protagonists, you could find all this shit.

2082
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:36,680
And, and they had like real things to do real stories.

2083
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:40,360
It wasn't like a captain Marvel situation or a Ray Skywalker situation.

2084
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:43,480
If we're going to go down like the quartering route here, where they have like these female

2085
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:46,920
characters that have no arcs, they undergo no growth.

2086
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:49,000
They don't suffer and like overcome and get better.

2087
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
They're just bad-ass from the start.

2088
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:51,720
And then they just win.

2089
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,400
And it's not really an interesting story.

2090
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:59,720
You know, you actually find female characters in video games who suffered and became heroic

2091
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:01,000
like male characters did.

2092
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,080
That's been in gaming since before I was born.

2093
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:09,240
So I just think that like this whole, we need more diversity in games.

2094
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:12,440
It always just ringed hollow to anyone who knew, you know?

2095
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:17,480
No, I mean, I'm not saying that that sentiment itself was correct.

2096
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:20,360
I'm just saying like, I don't know.

2097
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:28,440
I saw, I see like people freaking out about their being more representation and it seems

2098
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:35,640
kind of like, well, I'm not saying that we should push for it, but maybe they're being

2099
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:40,280
more than there was prior is kind of like a natural progression of things, you know?

2100
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:48,520
But I think the ultimate issue is just that the games suck, but they hide behind.

2101
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,040
They hide behind representation.

2102
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:53,400
It's like, Oh, well, your game actually controls really poorly and it's not very fun to play.

2103
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,320
Oh, but it has a black female protagonist.

2104
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,920
If you complain, you're a bigot.

2105
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:57,960
It's something like that.

2106
01:34:58,600 --> 01:34:59,640
And you saw a lot of that too.

2107
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:01,960
Yeah, for sure.

2108
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,480
I can definitely see that.

2109
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:10,280
Like with games and stuff, like with comics, like there've always been female protagonists

2110
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:13,080
in comics and in superhero comics and all of that.

2111
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:15,000
So, yeah.

2112
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,720
And they've always been pretty complex.

2113
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:23,160
So it's not anything new, like you said, but.

2114
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:23,800
Yeah, yeah.

2115
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:34,920
I was watching you watch Destiny and Richard Spencer talk last night, and there was something

2116
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:39,000
that you just said that was kind of related to that, where it's like, there's the globalization

2117
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,360
of culture and things are kind of becoming more mixed and these ideas are spreading around

2118
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:45,160
more quickly.

2119
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:50,280
I remember, like, I think both Destiny and Richard Spencer agreed that something's been

2120
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,600
lost in the globalization, right?

2121
01:35:53,400 --> 01:36:02,040
Yeah, the individual identity, people more easily found.

2122
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:08,120
I think it's harder for people to kind of feel like they're individualistic nowadays

2123
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:09,880
because everything is so widespread.

2124
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:10,280
I don't know.

2125
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,240
Maybe that's just my.

2126
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:13,880
Yeah, that's definitely part of it.

2127
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:18,600
There's also like, I think Destiny used the example of Nirvana, where they were just like

2128
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,280
being shitty in a garage and they were discovered and they blew up.

2129
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:27,560
And it was this kind of like, almost like music that was anti music because it was so

2130
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:34,440
it was so grungy, you know, but now everything is just kind of pre packaged and pre built

2131
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:39,880
and pre made and nothing like the Internet was a breath of fresh air because things could

2132
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:40,360
go viral.

2133
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:43,800
But even on the Internet now, like a lot of things that are going viral or like just kind

2134
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:44,840
of push to go viral.

2135
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,440
It's not organic anymore.

2136
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:47,800
It's all kind of like pre planned.

2137
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:54,280
And in my, I forget how I worded it.

2138
01:36:54,280 --> 01:37:00,040
I, you watched the video, it was the video about being indigenous.

2139
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:01,400
What does it mean to be indigenous?

2140
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:06,120
I made the point that there's a lot of people who are, let's say far left, you know, they're

2141
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:10,520
socialists and they hate capitalist economics, right?

2142
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:15,640
They say that it turns people into disposable workers and everyone's just replaceable.

2143
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:19,160
And it doesn't actually respect the dignity of individuals.

2144
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:25,000
And it's a, the complaint is that it makes everything and everyone disposable.

2145
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,640
And that's like one of capitalism's greatest sins.

2146
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:33,480
The problem with the socialists are somewhat correct when they say that, that that's true.

2147
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:41,320
But the issue is the other half of the left, which is the progressives, they want to, you

2148
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:46,440
know, mix cultures, have more open borders, more immigrants.

2149
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:52,840
And what ends up happening is that with the cultural mix, you also get the economic fungibility.

2150
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:57,800
They kind of come hand in hand where like you, if you, I don't want to put this, it's

2151
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:03,080
something like, it's something like, fuck, how did I say it?

2152
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:04,840
I don't know.

2153
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:07,800
I said it so well in the video and now that I'm live streaming, I can't say it anymore.

2154
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:15,720
It it's, it's basically something along the lines of like the interchangeability that

2155
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:22,840
socialists decry when it comes to capitalism comes hand in hand with this, with the cultural

2156
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:27,640
interchangeability that naturally happens as a result of globalization and progressivism.

2157
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:32,040
And so in some senses, the left causes its own problem.

2158
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:40,120
And I don't think that socialists will ever want to admit that, but I think it's true.

2159
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:45,000
Can you repeat what you just said one more time?

2160
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,600
The, what you, the line you were trying so hard to.

2161
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,000
Yeah, I'll try, I'll try it again.

2162
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,920
So I'm like, I already have lost it.

2163
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:58,600
It's, it's something, it's something like the interchangeability in economics that

2164
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:05,720
socialists decry capitalism for having, they are partially caused by the interchangeability

2165
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:10,920
in culture that progressive is pushed for when they push for globalization and borders

2166
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,920
and the merging of cultures and stuff.

2167
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:13,320
Yeah.

2168
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:13,560
Yeah.

2169
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:18,840
So, so, so in some ways the left causes its own capitalist problem.

2170
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,120
Yeah, I could see that 100%.

2171
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:27,800
That's because you're not a socialist, a socialist will never admit that for them.

2172
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:32,040
It's always going to be like Marxist historical materialism and the contradictions of capitalism

2173
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,440
and all this shit, but like they, Oh man.

2174
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:34,680
Okay.

2175
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:38,040
There's a near reactionary writer named Nick land.

2176
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:42,760
And he basically agreed with everything that the socialists said, not everything, not everything.

2177
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:44,120
No, that's not, that's not accurate.

2178
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:48,360
He agreed with a lot of what the socialists said, but he said that the contradictions

2179
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:53,480
in capitalism were human beings and abolishing capitalism and abolishing people.

2180
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:59,320
And that's when you get into like the technocratic future where you have AI's running everything

2181
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:02,920
and AI's producing all the goods and all the services.

2182
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,760
And eventually they're just going to do away with humans.

2183
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,920
That's like the doomsday AI future.

2184
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:07,480
You know what I mean?

2185
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:08,280
Yeah.

2186
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:11,080
Oh, the chat says, Stardust seems bored.

2187
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:11,800
Sorry.

2188
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:12,920
No, I'm not bored.

2189
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:13,640
I'm not bored.

2190
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:24,040
I guess I'm just trying to like, because this is a little bit above my head.

2191
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:32,280
But okay.

2192
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:41,160
So I can definitely see that like the multiculturalism can, you know,

2193
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:46,040
and the pushing of progressive values and open borders and all of that leads to a lot

2194
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:53,640
of these, you know, downfalls of the economic system that like we operate under.

2195
01:40:55,080 --> 01:41:02,840
And I can see that, where was I going with this?

2196
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:14,040
It's time to take the neo reactionary pill, Stardust.

2197
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:21,880
Well, there is something like, okay, there's like a loss of individuality.

2198
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,120
And I think there's a loss.

2199
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:26,600
There's a little bit of a loss of community too, right?

2200
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:27,880
Like, well, not just a little bit.

2201
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:29,560
There's a huge loss of community.

2202
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:31,480
There's not just a loss of individuality.

2203
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:34,840
There's a loss of community, which is really strange to think about.

2204
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:40,600
Like both of these things happening simultaneously as a result of this,

2205
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:43,160
you know, increasingly multicultural society.

2206
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:45,080
But it makes sense.

2207
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:48,200
And I almost think that the fracturing of the internet is like,

2208
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:53,320
this is funny, because this is something that like JF Gorepi was saying that he thinks

2209
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:57,560
would happen, that there would be a fracturing of the internet.

2210
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:00,280
And not just him.

2211
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:04,040
Other people have talked about it like that, you know, there are different countries with

2212
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:07,960
their own internets now and, you know.

2213
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:09,320
And I think I said this too.

2214
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:13,160
I did a video in like 2016 called the Balkanization of Technology.

2215
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:19,480
It was right after like the, that James Guy put out, it was some kind of engineering

2216
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:24,120
document regarding how do you get more women into engineering spots in Google.

2217
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:27,400
He got fired for it because he spoke honestly about what the problem was.

2218
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:28,680
Oh, do you remember that at all?

2219
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,360
I don't remember that, no.

2220
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:31,560
Really?

2221
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:32,280
It was a big thing.

2222
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:33,960
I did a video about it like 2016.

2223
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:39,080
And my view was that the internet was going to Balkanize.

2224
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,320
And we'd have like right-wing websites and left-wing websites.

2225
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:42,600
You have right-wing Twitter, left-wing Twitter.

2226
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:42,920
Yeah, we see that.

2227
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,920
You have gaming Twitter, you know.

2228
01:42:44,920 --> 01:42:46,120
Yeah, we're seeing it, yeah.

2229
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:53,320
Yeah, so with that being said, you know, I think JF was saying that he could see it happening.

2230
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:56,680
And this is what I was trying to explain to Destiny earlier with like the Fediverse and

2231
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,180
all of that.

2232
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:05,320
You know, you see these instances like kind of blocking the entirety of other instances

2233
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:09,800
off and they kind of become their own insular community.

2234
01:43:10,360 --> 01:43:17,160
And you see the same thing with like, I don't know, you see, like you said, these subsets

2235
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:17,800
of Twitter, right?

2236
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:19,800
These subsets of Twitter communities.

2237
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,880
Someone in the chat said James Damore.

2238
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:22,520
That's who it was.

2239
01:43:22,520 --> 01:43:23,160
James Damore.

2240
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:33,720
Yeah, so I think it's interesting that we have this in the IRL space, I guess is what

2241
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:34,280
I would call it.

2242
01:43:35,080 --> 01:43:40,360
You have this increasing multiculturalism and it's good in a lot of ways, right?

2243
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:46,680
And it's increasing a culture being exported to a lot of different places and being shared

2244
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:48,200
with a lot of different places, right?

2245
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:54,360
And then at this, but at the same time, you have like a loss of people feeling like they've

2246
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,760
lost their individuality and their sense of community.

2247
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:01,720
And I think that what's happening on the internet with the, like what you're saying, the balkanization

2248
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:04,200
of the internet is kind of a response to that.

2249
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:13,640
So people are kind of looking for a sense of identity online and through politics and

2250
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:20,120
through their political identity online.

2251
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:22,600
And I think that we can kind of see that happening.

2252
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:31,400
Like you see how polarized people are in politics online, how people who should get along don't

2253
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:40,440
get along, like how much socialists of different types will fight with each other and like

2254
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,560
excommunicate each other.

2255
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:43,000
Well, that's not new.

2256
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
You can see that a hundred years ago, too.

2257
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:45,880
Oh, really?

2258
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:47,000
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

2259
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,640
It just feels like things are, it does feel like politics is more polarized though, at

2260
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:53,640
least in American society.

2261
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:58,280
Maybe it's just in my brain, but it seems like that's the case.

2262
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:07,800
And I think that might be a natural reaction to this loss of like what people think made

2263
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:09,800
them individual, I guess.

2264
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:10,840
I think that's part of it, yeah.

2265
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:15,240
I mean, Richard Spencer said something that I think is probably correct in that video

2266
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:16,440
you were watching yesterday.

2267
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:19,240
And it's that America was always an empire.

2268
01:45:19,240 --> 01:45:21,000
It wasn't a nation state, right?

2269
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:27,000
That's why you have states and not provinces because you have 50 states, 50 different types

2270
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:28,440
of people who are all kind of different.

2271
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,200
And you're all united under one federal government.

2272
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:35,320
You're from India, so you definitely know this too.

2273
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:37,880
Like the Indian government is a federal one because you have all these different types

2274
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,080
of people under one government.

2275
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:42,200
Canada is kind of the same.

2276
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:45,640
We have provinces in Canada, so it's not quite the same, but like there's definitely a difference

2277
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:49,480
between people on the East coast and the central Canada and the West coast, Ontario.

2278
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:52,120
You have the French people in Quebec, like different kinds of people here.

2279
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:58,520
Meanwhile, you look at Europe and in France, there's French people, right?

2280
01:45:58,520 --> 01:45:59,320
It's a nation state.

2281
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,480
In Japan, there's Japanese people.

2282
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,400
It's a state for a nation.

2283
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,080
That's not how it is in the West.

2284
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:13,240
So I think that basically because there's so many different types of people and we no

2285
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:22,040
longer have an identity because having one is racist now because they're going to call

2286
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:25,720
you white supremacists if you have any kind of identity, even if it's not a white one,

2287
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,160
you could be like, oh, I'm proud to be American.

2288
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,040
Oh, well that's being racist.

2289
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:28,680
It's like, well, is it?

2290
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:29,240
No, it's not.

2291
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:31,080
But some progressives say that it is.

2292
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:37,240
I think like once you strip away any sort of possible ethnic identity, whether it's

2293
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:41,640
like a civic nationalist identity or an ethnic nationalist identity, some sort of identity

2294
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:43,560
that revolves around your polity.

2295
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:49,000
Once you strip that away, you're left with political groups, ideologies.

2296
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,680
You're left with sports teams.

2297
01:46:50,680 --> 01:46:52,360
You're left with being a gamer or not.

2298
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:56,120
You're left with all sorts of other things that can be destructive, right?

2299
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:01,480
And I think Richard Spencer was right when he just talked about, he was saying stuff

2300
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:05,480
about how like there's, oh man, have you watched any crowd videos yet?

2301
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,760
I love crowd.

2302
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,840
Have you seen his video?

2303
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:13,800
It's an hour and a half long.

2304
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,080
His video on realism.

2305
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:17,560
No, I haven't seen it.

2306
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,080
That is one of the best ones he has made.

2307
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:19,720
You've got to watch it.

2308
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:20,200
It's great.

2309
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:26,680
But he spent some time talking about the crisis of modernity and the crisis of modernity.

2310
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:28,280
Have you heard about that idea before?

2311
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:35,720
I think I've heard it in vague terms, but I don't think I know what it means.

2312
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:42,360
It's basically the idea that we have reached the limit of enlightenment thinking.

2313
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:46,520
You know, the enlightenment came about because we realized, oh, we can use rationality to

2314
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:47,080
figure out the world.

2315
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:49,160
We're going to use science, the scientific method.

2316
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:50,280
We're going to use history.

2317
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,480
We're going to use languages.

2318
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:53,960
We're going to use all of the, we're going to, we're not, we're not going to be like

2319
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:55,720
emotional anymore.

2320
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:59,640
We're not going to be basing things on honor anymore or on like family tribal structures.

2321
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:02,200
We're going to be rationalistic about both society.

2322
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:02,680
Right.

2323
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:08,520
And, um, Hegel being a product of the enlightenment, he, he basically predicted

2324
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:12,760
fascism like over a hundred years before it came about, because he said that the, the

2325
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:18,520
ultimate rationalistic project would be the, would be the state as God on earth.

2326
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:22,440
Since if you, if you're going to construct everything rationalistically, you're going

2327
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:26,120
to plan everything out is going to require the ultimate state and the fascist fully

2328
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:26,680
embraced that.

2329
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:31,560
So, so fascism was kind of seen as like the natural end of enlightenment thinking.

2330
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:36,440
Um, this is by the way, the main reason that like that, that, that reactionaries view

2331
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:41,720
fascism as left wing, because they will say that liberalism, socialism, and fascism are

2332
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:43,800
all products of the enlightenment.

2333
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:47,240
And so they're on the left and they're thinking is pre enlightenment.

2334
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:50,680
It's, it's like, it's feudalism, it's monarchy, it's from before the enlightenment.

2335
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:52,520
So fascism is left wing to them.

2336
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:59,720
But, but, but basically, um, we actually have reached the, the limits of rationalistic

2337
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:03,160
thinking because we've discovered, um, what's it called?

2338
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:04,040
Hold on.

2339
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:09,720
Let me just, let me just real quick, uh, on, on that point though.

2340
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:12,920
Um, okay.

2341
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:13,640
I've got it.

2342
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:16,360
Um, Godel's incompleteness theorems.

2343
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:21,800
There are basically two things, uh, very tasking did a great video called, um, the hole

2344
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:22,680
at the bottom of math.

2345
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:26,520
The idea is basically that there are two things that we know to be true, but we can't

2346
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:27,080
prove them.

2347
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:29,080
It is impossible for human logic to prove them.

2348
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:35,000
And we don't know why, but they are true and they're unprovable and they're like a

2349
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,840
core component deep down in the most complicated parts of mathematics.

2350
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:41,000
We just can't prove them true, but we know that they're true.

2351
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:44,440
So it's like, well, you know, what do you, what do you do with that?

2352
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:49,240
Um, we've learned similar things about, about science regarding like, we can't truly

2353
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:52,920
know the position of, of an electron, right?

2354
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:55,800
We know it's there, but we, but we don't know which way it's spinning.

2355
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:56,680
We don't know which way it's rotating.

2356
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:58,840
We don't like, there are just some things that we cannot know.

2357
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:05,160
There's, there's a, there's a hard limit on what we can rationalistically, um, figure

2358
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:09,720
out using human senses and using all of our, using all of our skills and all of our

2359
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:10,120
abilities.

2360
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:18,200
Um, and this is, this is basically the, you can read a lot of people who are anti-liberal

2361
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:21,960
like, like a lot of the fascist writers, a lot of the socialist writers, a lot of, a

2362
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:26,200
lot of these, these, these political theorists and they all independently come to the same

2363
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:27,000
conclusion.

2364
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,880
And that conclusion ultimately is that, um, ideology doesn't matter at all.

2365
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:37,400
It's just, it's all just like a post hoc justification for uses of power.

2366
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:41,160
So liberal socialists and fascists will all do the same thing, given the exact same

2367
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:43,400
historical material conditions.

2368
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:48,440
And they just use their ideologies to disguise their, their, to legitimize their use of

2369
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:48,760
power.

2370
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:52,520
And I don't believe that by the way, but that's how, that's how these people view it.

2371
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:56,200
And, and they, they get to this point of view because it's a crisis.

2372
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:57,240
It's like a crisis of meaning.

2373
01:50:57,240 --> 01:51:01,560
Basically, there's, there's nothing underneath any of it.

2374
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:07,320
It sounds very nihilistic, but it's like, there's no foundation to any of our beliefs.

2375
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,960
And so the bottom has fallen out.

2376
01:51:09,960 --> 01:51:10,920
There's no God.

2377
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:11,720
God won't catch us.

2378
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:14,280
Cause now we, we, you know, God is dead and he said, God is dead.

2379
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:15,640
So there's, there's like, there's nothing.

2380
01:51:15,640 --> 01:51:16,680
And it's like, well, what do we do?

2381
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:18,920
Oh, lots of people say it's all just power.

2382
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:21,880
It's just political power at the end of the day and power is all that matters.

2383
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:25,480
I don't believe that, but it's a very seductive argument.

2384
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:26,520
Crote's video is very good on it.

2385
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:27,640
You should, you should watch it for sure.

2386
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:30,600
Sorry for the, sorry for the rant.

2387
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:30,840
Sorry.

2388
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:33,000
No, it's really interesting.

2389
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,040
It's fascinating.

2390
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:38,600
Um, uh, is that his most recent video critique?

2391
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:40,760
A critique of realism.

2392
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:42,120
Yeah.

2393
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:45,000
Is that still the most recent video?

2394
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:45,960
I think it is.

2395
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:46,440
I think so.

2396
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:46,760
Yeah.

2397
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:47,480
Three weeks ago.

2398
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:48,440
Yeah.

2399
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:57,960
Um, uh, interesting that you say that cause, um, I remember also that conversation yesterday

2400
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:03,560
that, that Spencer and, and destiny were having, having, and, and, uh, Spencer said

2401
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:10,840
that like liberal, is it liberalism that he said was a, was a, was a donut.

2402
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:12,440
Yes.

2403
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:14,040
With nothing in the center.

2404
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:15,720
He said liberalism's a donut.

2405
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:19,400
It offers people nothing to actually hold on to because it has no prescriptions.

2406
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,400
There's probably some truth to that.

2407
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:25,400
If you think about it, I think, I think what he meant by that, it was something like,

2408
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:29,960
it's something like, okay, maybe, maybe it's more libertarianism than liberalism,

2409
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:33,720
but like definitely, you know, if you, you know, what, what is the argument for

2410
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:34,920
decriminalizing pot?

2411
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:36,600
Well, it doesn't hurt me if you're just doing it to yourself.

2412
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:37,240
It doesn't matter.

2413
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:37,880
Right.

2414
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:41,560
That's a decent argument for a commonizing pot, but like, you can take that logic to

2415
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:42,440
some pretty dark roads.

2416
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:45,400
You can say it for like meth for heroin.

2417
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,400
You see people destroying their lives in the streets.

2418
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:48,440
Like, well, that's not good.

2419
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:48,920
Right.

2420
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:49,240
Yeah.

2421
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:56,040
Um, I think what if all test at one point said that society is just a foundation that

2422
01:52:56,120 --> 01:53:00,040
we all agree to believe in, and then we build on top of that.

2423
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:03,880
But if you don't have the same foundation, you can't, you can't really get along.

2424
01:53:03,880 --> 01:53:04,840
There's something like that.

2425
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:08,760
It's like, well, we've agreed on this logic and we're going to guide ourselves by this

2426
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:09,080
logic.

2427
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:10,200
These are going to be our core rules.

2428
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:13,800
And then from there we can have, you know, as long as we're all playing the same game,

2429
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:18,360
we can, we can play the game and maybe I win sometimes, maybe you win sometimes we're all

2430
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:19,320
playing the same game.

2431
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:22,440
If you're outside the game and you're trying to destroy the game, it's a different type

2432
01:53:22,440 --> 01:53:23,400
of politics altogether.

2433
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:23,880
Yeah.

2434
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:24,760
You know what I mean?

2435
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:29,000
So I think, I think that's what he was getting at is something like, I know Sargon wrote

2436
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:34,600
the article, the asset of liberalism, where basically because liberalism has no prescriptions

2437
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:39,480
and it like, and the progressives kind of morph all culture into like this unified gray

2438
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:43,080
sludge that where no one's offended and nothing's really distinct anymore.

2439
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:46,200
I've heard the gray sludge from Spencer before, actually.

2440
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:46,680
Yeah.

2441
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:47,560
Lots of people have said that.

2442
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:48,040
Yeah.

2443
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:48,200
Yeah.

2444
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:57,480
It's just this, this, it's this idea that because, you know, if you talk to a liberal,

2445
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:59,160
they'll say, well, freedom is our virtue.

2446
01:53:59,160 --> 01:54:02,760
And it's like, well, that's a pretty good virtue if you're oppressed, but what virtues

2447
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:05,960
are there if you're not oppressed, if you don't eat, like you don't eat freedom anymore,

2448
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:09,320
you know, you're you live in a, in a free society.

2449
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:10,120
What do you do now?

2450
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:12,280
Liberals don't seem to have an answer for that.

2451
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:14,680
They don't have like a positive vision they can put forward of the world.

2452
01:54:14,680 --> 01:54:16,280
Well, it's like, well, you should do this.

2453
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:20,520
Conservatives have that, which is why even though I like, I'm not really, I don't view

2454
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:21,640
myself as a conservative.

2455
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:24,760
I don't like a conservative politician, especially in, especially in America.

2456
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:25,880
They're fucking insane.

2457
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:31,240
But conservative political philosophy is very good because liberalism will, will liberate

2458
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:34,760
you, but it won't tell you what to do with your liberation.

2459
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:39,080
Conservatives will though conservatives will say, okay, well, maybe you should you know,

2460
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:44,360
get married and have kids and, you know, work, work a decent job, provide for yourself, build

2461
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:46,680
something of value to you and those around you.

2462
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:48,920
It goes, they're all conservative prescriptions, right?

2463
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:50,200
A liberal wouldn't tell you that stuff.

2464
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:52,520
Yeah.

2465
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:59,320
I, I, I think, I, I think I've, I've said this a few times.

2466
01:54:59,320 --> 01:55:03,320
It's like governments should be liberal and people should be conservative.

2467
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:05,640
I think it's something like that.

2468
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:10,520
I was talking to Dylan Burns and he, he took offense at how I worded it, but he ultimately

2469
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:11,080
agreed with me.

2470
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:15,160
I said, if you're, if you're talking to a young gay man who doesn't know what to do

2471
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:20,760
with his life, would you tell him to get married to a partner and adopt some kids and be responsible

2472
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:25,240
and have a family and, you know, be a pillar of your community, or would you, would you

2473
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:29,560
go to the piss guzzling orgies and spread disease around what's better for you?

2474
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:31,240
You know, you can do both of them.

2475
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:32,840
You're free, but what's better for you?

2476
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:35,240
Like clearly the first option is better than the second, right?

2477
01:55:36,360 --> 01:55:36,840
Yeah.

2478
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:37,960
Yeah.

2479
01:55:37,960 --> 01:55:44,440
So I, I think, yeah, I think, I think you need like a dose of conservatism to go along

2480
01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:46,440
with your liberalism just to give you direction in life.

2481
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:49,400
Yeah, I can agree with that.

2482
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:50,920
I can agree with that.

2483
01:55:53,400 --> 01:56:00,120
Yeah, some of these, some of these, you know, ideas are definitely like above my head.

2484
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:03,880
But they're definitely very interesting.

2485
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:08,360
Kraut's video, man, you'll, I don't know if you want to watch it on stream or anything,

2486
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:10,440
but it's, it's a really good video to watch.

2487
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:12,440
He, he does it better than me.

2488
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:13,000
That's for sure.

2489
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:18,120
Some of your chat is like, anyone want to write an article in Mr.

2490
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:19,640
Girl, Lav and Shaylin with me?

2491
01:56:20,680 --> 01:56:24,520
You know, I, I'm not in the destiny orbiter sphere.

2492
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:26,680
I don't completely know what's going on.

2493
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,240
What's the, what's the latest on Mr.

2494
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:30,840
Girl and Lav and Shaylin?

2495
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:31,720
Lav and Shaylin.

2496
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:35,080
We had the call where I yelled at Shaylin.

2497
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:36,040
She came in screaming.

2498
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:39,240
And so I, I just like snapped and I started yelling at her and calling her.

2499
01:56:39,240 --> 01:56:40,120
Oh, that's right.

2500
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:40,620
Yeah.

2501
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:44,040
He told her to go be a sex doll.

2502
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:50,680
Yeah, I went a little bit on hinge there, but like, I don't know what it is.

2503
01:56:50,680 --> 01:56:55,800
Like she came in screaming and her voice was just so grating on me.

2504
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:58,840
And usually it takes me a lot to push me to the edge.

2505
01:56:58,840 --> 01:57:07,160
But that night, her coming in and screaming was, it was just, it just took me there.

2506
01:57:07,160 --> 01:57:10,440
I just started seeing red and I couldn't help myself.

2507
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:18,520
And I started yelling at her and yeah, I just lost my cool, you know, hate to see it, but

2508
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:20,520
I thought it was really funny.

2509
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:21,400
I remember seeing that now.

2510
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:21,640
Yeah.

2511
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:23,320
I thought it was really funny.

2512
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:23,880
Oh man.

2513
01:57:23,960 --> 01:57:30,600
There was, so, you know, I've always considered myself like kind of a, kind of a moderate

2514
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:33,880
kind of a centrist, um, for a long time.

2515
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,960
I called myself Senator left like eight years ago.

2516
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:39,400
I don't, I no longer feel comfortable calling myself Senator left because the left's gone

2517
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:44,120
fucking nuts, you know, and plus people who are, who are truly on the socialist left,

2518
01:57:44,120 --> 01:57:45,640
they think I'm a fascist anyway, so fuck it.

2519
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:47,880
You know, I don't, I don't owe these people anything.

2520
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:53,640
Um, but like I've seen some people in my chat or sorry, not in my chat, in, in my comments,

2521
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:55,720
they're like devs turning leftward.

2522
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:58,600
So he can, he can try to be the next destiny orbiter.

2523
01:57:58,600 --> 01:58:02,600
And I'm like, you know, I've, I've had the, the permission is to go into destiny stream

2524
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:03,480
for like six months now.

2525
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:04,680
And I haven't used them.

2526
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:09,880
I can use them once, you know, and you know, I'm, I'm not as big as destiny, but I'm about

2527
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:11,800
like 20% destiny size.

2528
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:15,320
When I fire up a stream, I can get like maybe 500, maybe a thousand for a political stream.

2529
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:16,440
It's not, it's not bad numbers.

2530
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:16,920
Right.

2531
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:20,600
So like, I don't, I don't need, I no offense to destiny.

2532
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:22,520
He's not going to watch us, but no offense to him anyway.

2533
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:24,280
But I don't, I don't like need the bump.

2534
01:58:24,280 --> 01:58:25,080
Does that make sense?

2535
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:30,360
So there are people who are like, I can't believe you're trying to like, like, like

2536
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:31,480
a court DGG.

2537
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:33,400
I'm like, I'm not, I'm really not.

2538
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:37,480
You don't need to be a left-winger to, you don't need to be a left-winger to be an orbiter

2539
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:37,800
either.

2540
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:41,720
I mean, like, uh, you know, I'm pretty sure that they're, you know, they're people who

2541
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:44,520
don't align with him on stuff.

2542
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:49,880
Um, I, I, I'm pretty sure like I kind of more identify as like a neoliberal, I think.

2543
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:55,720
You know, I think, uh, I don't know what I identify as, but, um, but, you know, I think

2544
01:58:55,720 --> 01:59:01,000
there's like a communist chick, um, you know, there's, yeah, yeah, there's a communist chick

2545
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,840
who, who joins the calls.

2546
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:10,680
Um, you know, there are people of different political, um, different political, you know,

2547
01:59:10,680 --> 01:59:12,520
leanings, counterpoint is in there.

2548
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:12,840
Right.

2549
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:14,520
Cause he's, he's a conservative in there.

2550
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:14,840
Yeah.

2551
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:15,000
Yeah.

2552
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,800
He's a conservative or he's center, right.

2553
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:18,520
You know?

2554
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:20,360
So, yeah.

2555
01:59:21,240 --> 01:59:24,040
Um, isn't ABBA also kind of conservative too?

2556
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:28,600
He strikes ABBA is, I think he's more apolitical.

2557
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:33,240
Um, yeah, maybe, maybe.

2558
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:40,120
But yeah, sometimes like I, sometimes I get a bit tired of just the constant drama that

2559
01:59:40,120 --> 01:59:42,520
comes into that community, but sometimes it's fun to watch.

2560
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:44,440
Sometimes it's fun to watch just a good show.

2561
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:46,200
Yeah.

2562
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:47,240
Yeah.

2563
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:52,520
Um, Destiny even said Connor was his star opposition right now.

2564
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:53,080
That's fake.

2565
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:53,560
Is that true?

2566
01:59:54,360 --> 02:00:02,280
Oh, I, uh, I, I haven't like, maybe this is, I don't know how I want to word this carefully.

2567
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:07,800
I wouldn't mind talking to Connor, but one, I don't know if you want to talk to me and

2568
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:09,160
two, I don't know what we talk about.

2569
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:11,560
I'm not sure.

2570
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:13,800
He's a really cool guy.

2571
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:15,480
I get along with him really well.

2572
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:19,480
Um, yeah, yeah.

2573
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:20,760
He's very, very cool.

2574
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:22,760
Um, uh, you'd probably get along with him.

2575
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:23,560
Yeah.

2576
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:24,440
But yeah, I don't know.

2577
02:00:24,440 --> 02:00:25,880
I don't know what you guys would talk about.

2578
02:00:27,720 --> 02:00:27,880
Yeah.

2579
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:28,600
I don't, I don't know.

2580
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:29,720
I don't know either.

2581
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:33,160
Um, was there any more gamer gate stuff to talk about?

2582
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:38,600
There probably is, but I'm probably going to have to like, look and read more on it

2583
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:40,360
and then come back at you with stuff.

2584
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:41,640
Yeah.

2585
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:41,960
Yeah.

2586
02:00:42,600 --> 02:00:43,400
There's so much.

2587
02:00:44,360 --> 02:00:45,640
Who was, oh God.

2588
02:00:45,640 --> 02:00:45,800
Yeah.

2589
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:48,360
There's so many old names that I just remember now.

2590
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:50,200
You know, like there's this person is Margaret.

2591
02:00:50,200 --> 02:00:51,400
Plus who is Margaret plus?

2592
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:53,080
Oh yeah.

2593
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:53,640
Some nutter.

2594
02:00:57,640 --> 02:00:58,600
Alistair Pinsoff.

2595
02:00:58,600 --> 02:00:59,400
Oh fuck that.

2596
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:00,600
Oh, hold on.

2597
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:01,960
I almost remembered who that was.

2598
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:09,640
Somebody says, talk the Anita Sarkeesian edge.

2599
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:12,280
Anita Sarkeesian.

2600
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:14,280
Talk the Anita.

2601
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:16,280
What do you mean by the Anita Sarkeesian edge?

2602
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:17,160
Yeah.

2603
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:18,200
I don't know what that means.

2604
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:20,760
Um,

2605
02:01:24,120 --> 02:01:25,720
Oh no, uh, Alistair Pinsoff.

2606
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:31,880
He was like, uh, he was, he was, um, he was part of, uh, was it destructoid?

2607
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:32,120
Yeah.

2608
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:35,960
There was only one gaming outlet that was pro gamer gate at the time.

2609
02:01:35,960 --> 02:01:38,840
And that was, um, that was the escapist.

2610
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:46,440
And they got, like, they got fucking cut off from everyone because of their pro gamer gate stance.

2611
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:46,840
That's right.

2612
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:47,160
Yeah.

2613
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:51,720
February 13, a movie, Bob was fired from the escapist.

2614
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:53,560
Wow.

2615
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:59,080
Um, what have you been thinking about all the Islam stuff recently?

2616
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:03,000
Oh, like all the destiny shit posting about Islam.

2617
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:05,080
I mean, it's funny.

2618
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:05,560
Right.

2619
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:06,920
I mean, it's funny.

2620
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:07,480
Right.

2621
02:02:07,480 --> 02:02:11,720
But I mean, I remember like duking it out with Muslims 10 years ago and it was the same stuff,

2622
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:16,200
like death threats constantly, just, you know, claims of being Islamophobic.

2623
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:21,080
It's like, when I first came onto the internet, the first people I ended up in,

2624
02:02:21,080 --> 02:02:24,040
like interacting and arguing with were like funding Muslims.

2625
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:29,880
Half of them were funding Muslims and half of them were like, uh, super far right people.

2626
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:34,600
Um, and they were kind of, they kind of interacted with each other a lot

2627
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:39,240
and they hated each other, even though most of the views that they had were very similar.

2628
02:02:39,240 --> 02:02:42,120
So, um, yeah.

2629
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:42,360
Yeah.

2630
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:49,480
Well, I mean, I remember 10 years ago, you know, conservatives would not like the comparison with

2631
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:52,520
Sharia law, presumably because of, you know, the war on terror.

2632
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:54,520
And now they're like, oh, it's pretty based actually.

2633
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:55,320
It's like, yeah, guys.

2634
02:02:55,320 --> 02:02:55,800
Yeah.

2635
02:02:59,480 --> 02:02:59,800
Yeah.

2636
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:01,880
The, um, oh yeah.

2637
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:04,440
Ethan Ralph got started in gamer gate too.

2638
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:05,080
Did you know that?

2639
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:06,680
Yeah, I didn't know that.

2640
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:06,920
Yeah.

2641
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:11,480
He, he wrote, he, he wrote some articles right on it.

2642
02:03:11,480 --> 02:03:12,520
That's how we got started.

2643
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:13,800
Yep.

2644
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:16,040
He and I were friends at one point, way back in the day.

2645
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:19,640
He like, you're still cool.

2646
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:25,160
Kind of, but hold on away from, I'm trying to stay away from that.

2647
02:03:25,720 --> 02:03:29,560
Um, didn't he like get your channel blasted off the internet?

2648
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:31,880
I don't know who was him specifically,

2649
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:35,720
but it was definitely like one of his super fans that had it happen.

2650
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:43,400
There are old logs of Ralph participating in getting channels taken down during gamer gate.

2651
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:44,840
So like, I would not be surprised.

2652
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:46,280
He's always done this shit.

2653
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:48,440
He's like, he's always done this shit.

2654
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:49,560
Yeah.

2655
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:54,200
I mean, I still think he's an interesting guy.

2656
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:56,600
Oh, for sure.

2657
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:56,840
Yeah.

2658
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:58,040
He's really funny.

2659
02:03:58,040 --> 02:03:59,480
He's always got something going on.

2660
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:00,760
He's very funny.

2661
02:04:00,760 --> 02:04:02,280
He's a great entertainer.

2662
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:03,480
He's an excellent entertainer.

2663
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:06,360
Say what you will about him, but he knows how to entertain an audience.

2664
02:04:08,280 --> 02:04:13,640
To the point where even his hate watchers like are tuning in because they're entertained by the guy.

2665
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:17,240
Um, I mean, yeah.

2666
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:18,120
Yeah.

2667
02:04:18,120 --> 02:04:18,920
Here's the thing though.

2668
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:21,880
Like he, he got Sargon banned off Patreon.

2669
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:25,240
He helped get crowd ban banned off the internet for a while.

2670
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:27,640
Like he's, he's fucked over.

2671
02:04:27,640 --> 02:04:31,880
Like every he he's, he's rather apolitical when it comes to who he fucks over.

2672
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:33,640
He fucks over everyone all the time.

2673
02:04:34,520 --> 02:04:36,680
You know, if he can do it, he will.

2674
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:42,280
So I'm actually just going to see real quick.

2675
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:44,120
Where does this timeline end?

2676
02:04:48,920 --> 02:04:49,960
Oh, 2022.

2677
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:50,440
That's right.

2678
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:54,200
David de Pape attacks Paul Pelosi with a hammer.

2679
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:56,760
He describes himself as radicalized by gamer gate.

2680
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:58,280
Jesus.

2681
02:04:59,400 --> 02:04:59,960
Yeah.

2682
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:00,440
Wow.

2683
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:02,120
Fucking hell, man.

2684
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:11,320
Yeah, I see 2021 January brand new states in the aftermath of 2021 United States Capitol attack that.

2685
02:05:12,440 --> 02:05:18,600
Everything I tried to get the FBI to act on in the aftermath of gamer gate has now come true.

2686
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:23,400
We told people that have social media companies like Facebook and Reddit did not tighten their

2687
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:28,360
policies about these communities organized hate that we are going to see violent insurrection

2688
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:29,720
in the United States.

2689
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:33,240
We told people that these communities were organizing online for violence and extremism

2690
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:36,760
that unfortunately has proven to be true.

2691
02:05:41,240 --> 02:05:41,800
Interesting.

2692
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:44,860
Yep.

2693
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:49,500
Tech rafter describes gamer gate as an insane alt-right hate group.

2694
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:51,100
I don't know.

2695
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:59,500
It seems like gamer gate was had so many moving parts.

2696
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:02,220
It's not accurate to call it a group of any type.

2697
02:06:02,860 --> 02:06:04,140
Yeah, yeah.

2698
02:06:04,140 --> 02:06:08,620
There was definitely people from all across the political spectrum that were engaged in it.

2699
02:06:08,620 --> 02:06:10,220
There were definitely some harassers.

2700
02:06:10,220 --> 02:06:13,420
There were definitely some people who were just looking to make a name for themselves.

2701
02:06:14,380 --> 02:06:17,020
There were people, there were there were right-leaning people who just wanted to

2702
02:06:17,020 --> 02:06:18,300
fuck with the feminists.

2703
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:22,460
They were left-leaning people who saw this as a stab in the back from progressives who

2704
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:25,580
should have had their back, but those progressives ended up being corrupt.

2705
02:06:25,580 --> 02:06:28,540
So like there, it was all sorts of things all at once.

2706
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:29,040
Yeah.

2707
02:06:31,100 --> 02:06:32,220
Who is this editor of tech?

2708
02:06:32,220 --> 02:06:32,380
Yeah.

2709
02:06:32,380 --> 02:06:35,420
Tech rafter was very pro gamer gate back in the day.

2710
02:06:35,980 --> 02:06:37,900
And they've always been like pretty chill.

2711
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:42,060
I wonder if they, if they had a new editor that like, or like if they just change their views.

2712
02:06:44,220 --> 02:06:48,700
Oh, it says here, tech rafter announces a complete removal of all gamer gate articles,

2713
02:06:48,700 --> 02:06:52,220
citing that they violated journalistic ethic of do no harm

2714
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:53,980
by writing the articles in the first place.

2715
02:06:53,980 --> 02:06:54,460
Wow.

2716
02:06:54,460 --> 02:06:55,100
What the fuck?

2717
02:06:55,660 --> 02:06:55,900
Yeah.

2718
02:06:55,900 --> 02:06:57,980
I'm not sure that's a journalistic ethics thing.

2719
02:06:57,980 --> 02:06:59,180
Articles do harm all the time.

2720
02:06:59,180 --> 02:06:59,820
It just depends.

2721
02:07:00,460 --> 02:07:01,180
Yeah.

2722
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:02,220
And it's going to sound strange.

2723
02:07:02,780 --> 02:07:05,820
It's going to sound strange, but like harm isn't,

2724
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:07,580
sometimes isn't the most important thing, you know?

2725
02:07:08,380 --> 02:07:08,880
Yeah.

2726
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:10,080
Yeah.

2727
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,200
Maybe tech rafters got in.

2728
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:15,680
Cause like, I remember talking to the editor of tech rafter back then,

2729
02:07:15,680 --> 02:07:17,920
and he was a really chill person.

2730
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:20,080
I mean, you know, editors change out all the time, right?

2731
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:21,120
Like people who run sites.

2732
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:22,560
So who knows?

2733
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:23,680
Maybe they just go in a new direction.

2734
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:26,400
That's that's, that's their business, I guess.

2735
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:28,400
Hmm.

2736
02:07:28,400 --> 02:07:34,720
Um, I, there was something on my mind, but I can't remember what it was.

2737
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:38,080
Oh yeah, that's right.

2738
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:43,040
I did a video on this fucking Mercedes Carrera ended up sexually abusing her daughter.

2739
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:44,640
Fuck.

2740
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,680
Yikes.

2741
02:07:45,680 --> 02:07:47,440
Oh, that's so disgusting.

2742
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:49,520
Do you know who Mercedes Carrera is?

2743
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:52,160
I don't know who that is, but so disgusting.

2744
02:07:52,160 --> 02:07:55,360
She's a porn star who got in on the whole gamer gate thing.

2745
02:07:56,160 --> 02:07:58,880
And she, she was talking about it back in 2014.

2746
02:07:59,600 --> 02:08:05,120
And, um, basically it came out in 2019

2747
02:08:06,080 --> 02:08:07,680
that she had been molesting her daughter.

2748
02:08:09,200 --> 02:08:11,600
Ew, that's so gross.

2749
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:12,800
Yeah, she's still behind bars.

2750
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,440
She probably will be for a very long time.

2751
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:17,760
Yeah, I hope she's there for life.

2752
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:22,560
Something like, I must admit, I have watched her porn.

2753
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:25,760
So something changed between 2014 and 2019.

2754
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:30,560
Like she was clearly beginning to use drugs or something because something changed radically

2755
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:33,520
in how she looked and it wasn't just aging, you know?

2756
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:38,000
She always kind of had like that Latina MILF thing going on because she's like, she's tall.

2757
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,840
She's, she's very wide hipped.

2758
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:41,440
So she, she had like a niche in porn.

2759
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:45,840
And in 2014, she was really like making money off that niche for sure.

2760
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:50,640
But by 2019, like something had radically changed about, about like the way her face

2761
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:54,960
looked the way her body looked like, like she would, she, she was using drugs or something.

2762
02:08:55,680 --> 02:09:02,320
Cause yeah, drugs don't make you don't make you feel.

2763
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:03,760
I know drugs don't make you a pedo.

2764
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:04,160
I know that.

2765
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:10,800
I know that chat, but like she had gone down some kind of rabbit hole for sure.

2766
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:15,440
Yeah.

2767
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:16,000
Oh man.

2768
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:19,600
I'm trying to remember what it was that I was going to bring up, but I can't remember.

2769
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:25,120
I mean, I can always bring it up at another time, I guess.

2770
02:09:25,120 --> 02:09:29,360
Was it about, was it about harm not being the most important thing sometimes?

2771
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:32,160
No, it was something before that, I think.

2772
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:33,360
Oh, okay.

2773
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:36,800
Yeah, but that's okay.

2774
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:38,480
Um, thank you for doing this with me.

2775
02:09:38,480 --> 02:09:40,720
It was super informative.

2776
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:41,520
Yeah, no problem.

2777
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:42,720
Are you coming to the end of it?

2778
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:50,160
Uh, I actually was scrolling in reverse, but yeah, I saw the end of it.

2779
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:51,360
Um, no, no.

2780
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:54,160
I meant, are you coming to the end of, of, of our talk?

2781
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:58,720
Cause I think, I think I'm, yeah, cause I think I'm, I'm at the end of it's, it's not

2782
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,320
it's, it's nearly 10 o'clock for me.

2783
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:05,680
So I probably have to, uh, I think we've talked as much as we can in one sitting

2784
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:09,520
about gamer gate, you know, but I learned a lot for sure.

2785
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:14,000
So, um, I really appreciate you, um, coming on and telling me

2786
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,200
everything that you know about it.

2787
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:16,480
Oh yeah.

2788
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:17,120
No, no problem.

2789
02:10:17,120 --> 02:10:17,680
Of course.

2790
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,160
Anytime.

2791
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:20,800
And I'll definitely have to check out your videos on it too.

2792
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:21,200
Oh God.

2793
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:22,240
They're so old, man.

2794
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:25,840
2014.

2795
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:26,960
It's so bad.

2796
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:29,120
No, I'm sure it's fine.

2797
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:33,840
It's good to know like the context and kind of get into that space and get into that.

2798
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:38,960
Um, you know, like what the internet was like back then, you know, um, if you're

2799
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:41,520
really trying to get into, like understand it.

2800
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:46,640
So pretending that, pretending that you're, you're in 2014 again, you know?

2801
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:46,880
Yeah.

2802
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:47,520
Pretty much.

2803
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:47,760
Yeah.

2804
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,760
Were you, were you online back in 2014?

2805
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:54,800
2014.

2806
02:10:54,800 --> 02:11:00,320
Um, I think I was, I think I was a workaholic back in 2014.

2807
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:02,560
I didn't see any friends and I only worked.

2808
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:09,840
So I didn't, I, there are whole like years of my life where I just spent, uh, working

2809
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:15,920
myself to the bone and, uh, and didn't partake in any recreational activities.

2810
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:17,760
So I think that was probably back then.

2811
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:20,240
When did you, when did you start YouTubing anyway?

2812
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:24,480
Maybe like two years ago or something like that.

2813
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:24,720
Okay.

2814
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:28,080
Was it one of those things where you started it up because of the pandemic?

2815
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:29,200
Like you had free time now.

2816
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:32,080
So yeah, yeah, it was kind of one of those things.

2817
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:37,680
And then it ended up taking off because, um, well, I'd always been streaming, but

2818
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:42,640
the, you know, the, the streaming really took off when I started doing like going

2819
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:45,600
on political panels and things like that.

2820
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:47,760
And, um, I just kind of kept up with it.

2821
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:52,880
Um, which is weird because I don't think I'm particularly the smartest person in

2822
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:53,840
the world.

2823
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:59,040
Um, I don't think that, um, my takes on politics are particularly like

2824
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:03,280
groundbreaking or anything like that, but people liked what I had to say.

2825
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:07,680
So, um, it just kind of took off and I just kept doing it.

2826
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:09,200
But yeah.

2827
02:12:09,200 --> 02:12:14,720
Um, prior to that, I was like complete workaholic.

2828
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:17,440
I was like the type of person that I was such a workaholic.

2829
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:21,200
I made everybody else in the company, like look bad or made everybody else that

2830
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:22,560
worked with me look bad.

2831
02:12:22,640 --> 02:12:24,720
People hated me for it.

2832
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:30,800
Um, so, uh, and I had, I, I would, I stopped hanging out with friends.

2833
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:32,400
Cause I was like, I don't know.

2834
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:33,360
I have a problem.

2835
02:12:33,360 --> 02:12:35,680
Um, I saw, you know, I wouldn't hang out with friends.

2836
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:37,200
I didn't do anything recreational.

2837
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:41,440
I would just like work, come home and sleep and then wake up and go work again.

2838
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:44,000
So it was, yeah.

2839
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:50,720
With me, I man, I've, I've always joked that I've, I've consistently almost had

2840
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:55,200
a YouTube career because I've known so many, like I knew JonTron before he was

2841
02:12:55,200 --> 02:12:59,920
big and that's a, that's a whole fucking long story, but like, I knew him before

2842
02:12:59,920 --> 02:13:00,480
he was big.

2843
02:13:00,480 --> 02:13:01,520
I lost contact.

2844
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:05,440
I regained contact through Sargon because Sargon and JonTron are friends.

2845
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:08,240
And that was kind of like a weird, Hey, it's been like 10 fucking years.

2846
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:09,440
How have you been dude?

2847
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:11,040
So that was like a weird situation.

2848
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:18,160
Um, there's like a bunch of YouTubers that are, that are pretty big names.

2849
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:22,240
You know, we're, we're talking like over a million subs for sure that have like

2850
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:24,880
private messaged me and had been like, Hey, yeah, I secretly watch you.

2851
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:27,440
Don't tell anyone because I don't want to get canceled, but you know, I watch you

2852
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:30,640
and I watch Sargon and it's like, well, that's actually kinda, that's cool.

2853
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:31,200
That's cool.

2854
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:38,240
Um, and like, I had the idea to do some sort of internet content like a year and

2855
02:13:38,240 --> 02:13:43,280
a half before I started and this, and we started in 2009, so a long time ago,

2856
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:46,720
completely different internet back then, completely different, everything back

2857
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:48,240
then.

2858
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:52,320
And I've always been like, just a few months behind every trend.

2859
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:56,400
I've always like known people before they got big and then lost contact.

2860
02:13:56,400 --> 02:13:59,440
And it was like, like, it was hard to re to like reconnect with them.

2861
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:01,040
I lost contact with Sargon for awhile.

2862
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:03,520
I re-became his friend in like 2017 or something.

2863
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:08,400
Um, you know, I, I knew shoe on head back in the day.

2864
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:13,440
Like just, I, I I've, I've always been like on the periphery of people who have

2865
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:16,560
blown up and I haven't, I've never really blown up myself.

2866
02:14:17,520 --> 02:14:21,840
You know, Sargon gave me a shout out and I got like three, uh, 30,000 subs from it.

2867
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:22,720
That was pretty good.

2868
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,320
I got another 30,000 from gamer gate.

2869
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:25,440
That was pretty good.

2870
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:29,440
But for like, for the most part, it's just been like a long, slow grind.

2871
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:34,800
I kind of anticipate it's going to be a long slow grind for me as well.

2872
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:41,280
So, um, unless you want, unless you, unless you really want to milk that DGG

2873
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:42,240
connection.

2874
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:42,480
Yeah.

2875
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:43,920
I don't know.

2876
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:48,480
Like, uh, like I feel guilty doing it, but like, there's not a time that would

2877
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:52,480
be more relevant than right now while he's doing the whole anti Muslim arc,

2878
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:53,200
you know?

2879
02:14:53,200 --> 02:14:57,920
Um, but, uh, you know, I, I kind of feel guilty.

2880
02:14:57,920 --> 02:15:06,000
I wish I had like the, uh, blatant, I don't know, like, uh, um,

2881
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:11,600
there's some people who are just like really good at just milking it.

2882
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:13,280
And I'm just not one of those people.

2883
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:19,840
Um, but right now, everything that's happening is like super relevant to the

2884
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:21,920
things that I think about in my head.

2885
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:24,800
And also I was doing okay.

2886
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:26,640
I, I talked to Spencer first.

2887
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:27,120
Okay.

2888
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:28,240
Before Destiny did.

2889
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:28,960
Okay.

2890
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:32,320
Uh, you know, and I don't see him getting the same amount of shit.

2891
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:32,960
All right.

2892
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:33,920
That's all I'm saying.

2893
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:36,960
Yeah, that was, I, I saw that was pretty bullshit.

2894
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,760
Like the amount of the amount that mind waves went after you for that.

2895
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:41,760
And then just doesn't say a thing to destiny.

2896
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:43,120
Yeah.

2897
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:45,360
I've told you my opinion on that in private though already.

2898
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:45,840
Yeah.

2899
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:46,400
Yeah.

2900
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:51,360
And then, and then, you know, then the, the, uh, you know, obviously the whole

2901
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:57,200
anti-Islam arc is like, okay, I just debated some Muslims like a few days ago.

2902
02:15:57,200 --> 02:16:02,480
And now the whole anti-Islam arc that is happening, like, man, everything is so

2903
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:08,400
relevant right now, but when I get onto a stream with the, with the dude, like he is

2904
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:09,840
so bad at conversation.

2905
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:17,200
So, uh, Oh, someone in your chest says it's because mind waves wants to kiss

2906
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:18,480
destiny on the lips.

2907
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:20,240
Yeah, probably.

2908
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:20,880
Yeah.

2909
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:23,280
He doesn't want to lose that DGG connection.

2910
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:23,840
Yeah.

2911
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:24,560
Yeah.

2912
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:29,200
I'm very grateful for the connection, but yeah, it's like, I, I only want to jump

2913
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:31,360
onto a stream if I really have something to say.

2914
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:33,840
And then most of the time when I have something to say, there's already like

2915
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:36,240
five people on, so I can't get a word in.

2916
02:16:36,240 --> 02:16:39,520
And then when I, when I do have something to say and there aren't five

2917
02:16:39,520 --> 02:16:43,360
people on, I come on and they say something and then that's it.

2918
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:44,640
Yeah.

2919
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:45,040
Yeah.

2920
02:16:45,680 --> 02:16:47,920
I fucking hate panels for that reason.

2921
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:50,560
Like you never really, like you never really discussed the idea.

2922
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:51,360
You never really drill down.

2923
02:16:51,360 --> 02:16:54,720
It's everyone, like everyone gives their surface level takes and everyone like

2924
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:56,640
go round Robins a bit.

2925
02:16:56,640 --> 02:17:00,480
Maybe there's some drama where two people fight, but like, you don't really

2926
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:01,760
discuss an idea.

2927
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:03,280
Not really on a panel.

2928
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:05,040
It's kind of why, why I hate him.

2929
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:06,160
Like at some point, man.

2930
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:07,440
Okay.

2931
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:10,160
So I have, I have two videos coming up that you might like.

2932
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:11,920
And one of them, one of them is the Gramsci video.

2933
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:17,040
The other one is, was fascism actually capitalism and decay?

2934
02:17:17,680 --> 02:17:23,040
Because the answer to that is like 90% no, and leftists love to say that they'd

2935
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:23,600
love to say that.

2936
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:28,960
And it's, it's just not true, but like that's just a result of reading and

2937
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:31,520
reading and reading and reading and reading and understanding some of these

2938
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:34,880
ideas, but I could never find anybody who actually, who would actually debate

2939
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:35,200
that.

2940
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:35,360
Right.

2941
02:17:35,360 --> 02:17:38,880
Like I've, I've heard like Lance from the surf say that like 80 times.

2942
02:17:38,880 --> 02:17:41,120
I don't think he would ever talk to me his entire life.

2943
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:43,920
You know, Xander hall ducked out of a debate with me.

2944
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:49,760
So there's just like the part of the reason why I make the videos in the style

2945
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:55,680
that I make them is because I've like, I've like learned the socialist position

2946
02:17:55,680 --> 02:17:56,720
on a lot of these things.

2947
02:17:57,680 --> 02:18:01,040
And it's like, well, I know how to counter this and I'm never going to talk to

2948
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:02,800
them because they fucking hate me.

2949
02:18:02,800 --> 02:18:04,560
So I'll just make like a long ass video about it.

2950
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:08,400
You know, I'll just do like a, I'll just do a deep dive and I'll reference like

2951
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:10,160
books instead because fuck it.

2952
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:11,840
Yeah.

2953
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:23,600
Um, I think we've reached, I think we've like milked this as much as we can.

2954
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:25,200
I think so too.

2955
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:26,560
I think so too.

2956
02:18:26,560 --> 02:18:27,600
But it was super fun.

2957
02:18:27,600 --> 02:18:28,960
We should do this again soon.

2958
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:31,680
Like in the next few days.

2959
02:18:31,680 --> 02:18:34,080
I mean, I'm, you see me in your chat a fair amount.

2960
02:18:34,080 --> 02:18:38,480
So like, you know, when I'm around, I, I don't know if you prefer scheduling

2961
02:18:38,480 --> 02:18:39,200
things or not.

2962
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,040
It doesn't matter to me.

2963
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:43,920
Like if you want to just have like a random hour to talk, I'll pop in for a

2964
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:44,080
bit.

2965
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:45,760
That's okay with me if you want.

2966
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:51,280
Cause I'm usually around things cause I'm super disorganized, but you know,

2967
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:52,320
but yeah.

2968
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:54,800
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

2969
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:58,720
You know, I'm also not against doing things like impromptu as well.

2970
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:03,120
It's just good for me to schedule things cause I'll forget otherwise.

2971
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:04,080
So yeah.

2972
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:05,040
Okay.

2973
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:10,480
Well, if you, if you, if you actually want my videos, the playlist on my

2974
02:19:10,480 --> 02:19:13,520
channel, the playlist on my channel is called indefensible.

2975
02:19:13,520 --> 02:19:17,680
The first like 10 videos or so are gamer gate related past that it's just like

2976
02:19:17,680 --> 02:19:22,160
other gaming topics because it's just like, as, as time went on, I started

2977
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:24,000
doing other gaming videos and I just put them in the same place.

2978
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,040
It's all gaming related.

2979
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:26,800
It's not like philosophy related.

2980
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:32,000
So indefensible is the, indefensible is, is the playlist.

2981
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:33,440
Yeah.

2982
02:19:33,440 --> 02:19:36,160
I mean the pun is indefensible, but it's indie.

2983
02:19:37,680 --> 02:19:38,240
Yeah.

2984
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:38,800
Yeah.

2985
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:42,320
So like that's my playlist, just some ancient ass videos on there.

2986
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:46,480
Um, uh, that's right.

2987
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:48,400
The, the, uh, fucking word.

2988
02:19:48,400 --> 02:19:48,800
Where is it?

2989
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:49,120
Where is it?

2990
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:50,000
Where is it?

2991
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:50,560
Yeah.

2992
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:55,600
The know your meme page on gamer gate on Zoe Quinn on, on like the principal

2993
02:19:55,600 --> 02:20:00,560
players know your meme is really good for like documenting lots of old lore.

2994
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:01,600
They're a great resource.

2995
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:06,240
So if you want to see like the pro the explicitly pro gamer gate position,

2996
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:09,040
know your meme has it, they have like their timeline.

2997
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:16,480
Um, and I guess otherwise like try to dig up old internet aristocrat gamer gate

2998
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:19,760
videos, they're going to be on like a gym archive channel somewhere.

2999
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:21,440
You know, his stuff.

3000
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:23,280
I don't think I can watch a gym.

3001
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:28,240
I don't think I can watch gym on like, like, uh, on stream.

3002
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:32,880
I think it might be, he's, he uses a lot of slurs with me, at least his recent stuff.

3003
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:35,440
He, I know that he uses a lot of slurs.

3004
02:20:35,440 --> 02:20:38,240
So yeah, I think he did back then too.

3005
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:38,740
Yeah.

3006
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:41,120
But good resource.

3007
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:41,920
Good resource.

3008
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:48,960
Um, and yeah, I guess, uh, unrelated to gamer gate, you know, Croats realism video.

3009
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:49,600
Got to watch that.

3010
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:50,560
It's great.

3011
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:52,880
And I think, I think I recommended to you last time.

3012
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:54,000
Uh, what if alt hissed?

3013
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:57,120
He does great videos in the same style of crowd.

3014
02:20:57,760 --> 02:20:59,680
What is alt hissed?

3015
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:00,080
Okay.

3016
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:00,580
Yeah.

3017
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:09,200
He's he's, he's also a conservative, but he's, um, he's not that he's not biased.

3018
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:10,720
Also, he dumpstered Vosh in a debate.

3019
02:21:10,720 --> 02:21:11,680
It was fucking hilarious.

3020
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:14,480
Take a look at this.

3021
02:21:14,480 --> 02:21:15,120
Yeah.

3022
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:20,800
Uh, uh, uh, there was, uh, that's, he reacted to it where basically Vosh said,

3023
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:24,720
well, can you describe Simone de Beauvoir her, her writing?

3024
02:21:24,720 --> 02:21:25,680
He's like, oh yeah, of course he does.

3025
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:28,240
He starts launching into it and Vosh is like, uh, oh sure.

3026
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:32,240
Like he, it was fucking, do you remember seeing that?

3027
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:34,000
That's I don't remember seeing that.

3028
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:34,500
Okay.

3029
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:39,520
It was like, basically Vosh was trying to like out intellect him and he knew exactly

3030
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:44,400
what the writing was and Vosh just like chose a random name and it did not fucking play

3031
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:45,280
out well for him.

3032
02:21:46,080 --> 02:21:48,240
It sounds so similar to somebody we know.

3033
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:51,760
Um, I wonder where president Sunday got his mannerisms.

3034
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:52,320
Oh fuck.

3035
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:53,120
Oh fuck.

3036
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:57,200
Um, what, yeah, what if all test he's, he has his problems, but he's like, he's a good

3037
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:57,760
center, right.

3038
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:01,840
Resource when it comes to like history and philosophy, just, just, just, just, just

3039
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:04,000
remember his bias, but he's still pretty good.

3040
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:04,640
Yeah.

3041
02:22:04,640 --> 02:22:05,140
Yeah.

3042
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:05,920
Yeah.

3043
02:22:05,920 --> 02:22:06,160
Yeah.

3044
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:09,600
I think I'm going to have to do more reading on like some of these like social issues.

3045
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:16,240
Cause I clearly don't have the vocabulary to like, to like vocalize what I'm observing

3046
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:16,960
half the time.

3047
02:22:16,960 --> 02:22:22,400
I feel, but, um, yeah, I can't, I can't feel that that way sometimes too.

3048
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:24,880
That way you're way better than I am.

3049
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:25,920
You think so?

3050
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:27,280
Yeah, I think so.

3051
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:28,800
You've got all the reading.

3052
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:32,880
I, yeah, but I stutter and stumble over everything and I can't like, I can talk on a script

3053
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:34,800
decently, but I can't, I can't do streams.

3054
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:37,920
It seems sometimes I'm always just like stuttering and like, what do I mean?

3055
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:38,400
Oh, fuck.

3056
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:39,840
Yeah.

3057
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:40,720
I think you're really great.

3058
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:46,160
I, I, I, for me, it's like, I don't even have the vocabulary to even like, when I'm talking

3059
02:22:46,160 --> 02:22:51,200
about these things feel like they're kind of theoretical or something, or they feel

3060
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:52,800
like they're kind of abstract.

3061
02:22:52,800 --> 02:22:58,480
And, um, and I just don't have, I don't have the vocabulary to accurately explain them

3062
02:22:58,480 --> 02:22:59,040
fully.

3063
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:05,840
Um, like when we were talking about like, you know, individualism versus like, you know,

3064
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:10,560
this multiculturalist like world, you know, um, and things like that.

3065
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:16,000
Like, I don't know, these feel like things that I struggle for words, uh, with when I'm

3066
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:22,240
trying to describe them, but I don't know, maybe I just don't have enough like words

3067
02:23:22,240 --> 02:23:24,000
in my vocabulary or something.

3068
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:26,480
I, I can sit with this.

3069
02:23:26,480 --> 02:23:28,160
I feel that way about myself a lot too.

3070
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:31,600
Um, okay.

3071
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:33,200
I think, I think that's about it though.

3072
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:36,080
So if you want to talk again, we can talk again.

3073
02:23:36,080 --> 02:23:36,960
I'm usually around.

3074
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:39,040
It's not hard to, it's not hard to get ahold of me.

3075
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:40,080
Yeah.

3076
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:43,840
Let me, um, let me do some more diving into the gamer gate stuff and then I'll hit you

3077
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:45,600
up about like talking again.

3078
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:46,960
Sure.

3079
02:23:46,960 --> 02:23:47,360
Sure.

3080
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:47,920
Yeah.

3081
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:49,360
Maybe we can go through like that.

3082
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:54,240
You know, I think it's, I think it's super useful for me, like to go through the thing

3083
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:58,880
that's slanted against gamer gate, since you're, you seem like you're pretty pro gamer gate.

3084
02:23:58,880 --> 02:23:59,520
Yeah, I was.

3085
02:23:59,520 --> 02:23:59,840
Yeah.

3086
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:00,880
And yeah.

3087
02:24:00,880 --> 02:24:04,880
And then maybe I can do the same thing with like somebody who is anti gamer gate and like

3088
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:08,800
go through something that's pro gamer, like a pro gamer gate timeline with somebody who's

3089
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:09,520
anti gamer gate.

3090
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:10,320
That would be kind of cool.

3091
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:14,000
I mean, you could probably, maybe Brandon would do it with you.

3092
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:14,400
I don't know.

3093
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:15,680
Yeah.

3094
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:20,880
I don't know how many she, she would do, you know, I don't know how many, um, how many

3095
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,920
like sessions she would do with me, you know?

3096
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:24,240
Yeah.

3097
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:25,840
I don't know if that's fun for other people.

3098
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:27,600
I know it's fun for me, but you know.

3099
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:29,280
Yeah.

3100
02:24:30,800 --> 02:24:32,320
Uh, but yeah, I'll, I'll be around.

3101
02:24:32,320 --> 02:24:34,480
It's not hard to figure out where I am.

3102
02:24:34,480 --> 02:24:37,120
So yeah, I'll see you next time.

3103
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:37,360
Okay.

3104
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:38,960
See you next time.

3105
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:40,400
Thanks for joining Dev.

3106
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:40,880
Have a good night.

3107
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:41,680
No problem.

3108
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:42,000
See ya.

3109
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:43,120
Bye.

3110
02:24:45,440 --> 02:24:47,040
I'm going to be real with you, SFO.

3111
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:55,040
I looked up mold bug and, um, and I was like, bro, some of the stuff that this dude is saying

3112
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:56,160
is a little bit based.
