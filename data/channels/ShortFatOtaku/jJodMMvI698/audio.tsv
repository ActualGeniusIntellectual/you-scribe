6240	8240	Humanity seems to be hardwired for hierarchy.
8240	11960	I don't just mean that in the Petersonian way, but there's certainly that.
11960	14440	That's the source of the Jordan Peterson lobster meme.
14440	19000	Peterson pointed out that when two lobsters engage in a dominance dispute, the loser deflates
19000	20280	and the winner puffs himself out.
20280	25040	A brain mechanism in both lobsters helps make more serotonin available to the winner of
25040	27640	the dispute, and less serotonin available to the loser.
27640	33280	To make his point, he references a 1997 study where serotonin was injected into the subordinate,
33280	37640	freely moving lobster, meaning that the lobster was a recent loser of a dominance dispute,
37640	40400	but not so wounded from the encounter that he couldn't fight again.
40400	44800	The injection of the serotonin resulted in a renewed willingness on behalf of the subordinate
44800	49360	lobsters to engage the dominant lobsters in further agonistic encounters, but did not
49360	54280	actually change who initiated the encounter, how they fought, how quickly the fight escalated,
54280	55440	or who ultimately won.
55440	60120	In other words, the serotonin did not increase the lobster's ability to fight, only his willingness
60120	61120	to.
61120	63460	It took the edge off the bruised ego from the last encounter, basically.
63460	67720	And Peterson's argument is that even though humanity diverged from lobsters evolutionarily
67720	73020	350 million years ago, serotonin plays the same role in humans as it does in lobsters,
73020	74520	and in many other animals too.
74520	78080	When humans win or lose in a dominance dispute, serotonin goes up or down.
78080	81720	There you go, I've just given you Jordan Peterson's argument using the original research.
81720	84640	If you ever have to talk to somebody who hates hearing the name Jordan Peterson, just show
84640	85880	him this study instead.
85880	88360	But Peterson's way of looking at the topic is pretty simple.
88360	91480	Presumably because whenever we've heard his stuff, it's been in a YouTube video
91480	95020	of one of his lectures where he's giving information that is sufficiently low resolution
95020	99160	enough to get the idea across to a large crowd of people of varying backgrounds.
99160	100680	So let's dig into it a little bit more.
100680	104880	A lot of leftist thought revolves around the abolition of hierarchy due to it being a source
104880	105880	of oppression.
105880	111120	Marx's communism was envisioned as a moneyless, stateless, classless society, a society without
111120	112120	hierarchy.
112120	115040	He also aims towards statelessness and classlessness.
115040	119160	The market socialists view a large part of the hierarchies found in employment to be
119160	122440	unjust, especially where private owners are at the top.
122440	127080	Even the authoritarian socialists like to appeal to the abolition of hierarchy in their
127080	129560	rhetoric, though they never actually do it in practice.
129560	131820	Of course, none of them actually do it in practice.
131820	136400	The idea of abolishing the concept of hierarchy in a species which has a serotonergic system
136400	141000	in their brains to keep track of relative status among others is a fool's errand.
141040	144600	It will never happen and those attempts to do it are, in fact, bad for us.
144600	148100	But that doesn't mean that we're just cogs in the machine slotting into our proper place
148100	149100	either.
149100	150440	That's the fascist view on hierarchy.
150440	155200	The fascist idea of corporatism was not ruled by private corporation as we understand it
155200	156200	today.
156200	160240	It was the idea that the corporative state would be one in which the economy was managed
160240	164440	by representatives of employers, workers, and the party, and the state would direct
164440	167640	production to ensure that it remains in the national interest.
167640	172480	The fascist wanted to achieve a rational ordering of society through social control of the means
172480	174360	of production, just like the Marxists.
174360	177880	But where the Marxists wanted it achieved through worker control of the means of production
177880	182360	and the abolishment of social classes, fascists wanted it achieved by incorporating all people
182360	187200	and property, all public and private, all proletariat and bourgeoisie, into the state
187200	188200	itself.
188200	192200	Everybody had their place in the state hierarchy, and when everybody took their place, the fascist
192200	195800	utopia would be achieved, according to their theory anyway.
195800	201640	After fascism was gone, this tendency would be called class collaborationism by the Marxists.
201640	203860	For humans, hierarchy certainly exists.
203860	206200	We cannot do away with it as the Marxists would like.
206200	210680	We also can't exist in perpetuity in an unchanging, purely authoritarian hierarchy
210680	212080	as the fascists would like.
212080	216200	The Marxists are wrong in being anti-hierarchy, but the fascists are wrong in believing that
216200	218020	hierarchy should be immutable.
218020	222400	What they're both missing is the fact that almost all of life's pains and pleasures
222400	224720	come down to movement within a hierarchy.
224720	228640	What motivates you at any given moment is moving through some hierarchy.
228640	232120	What entertains you is watching others move through hierarchy too, and that doesn't
232120	234540	necessarily mean moving upward in perpetuity.
234540	237520	Why is watching your sports team win a game exhilarating?
237520	240860	Because we're watching the winners increase in status relative to the losers.
240860	244800	Why is watching a comedian who depreciates himself in front of his audience funny?
244800	248220	Because we're watching the comedian decrease in status for our entertainment.
248220	252440	Why is watching a person who acts like he's a 10 out of 10, but obviously isn't, strike
252440	256160	out spectacularly with a woman, so cringe-inducing?
256160	260120	Because he believes he's at one level of status, but he's actually at another.
260120	265000	Why is it that we want to watch a swaggering bully fall down the stairs, but not a 90-year-old
265000	267040	grandma who can barely walk?
267040	271080	Because the former is perceived as a justified reduction of status, while the latter feels
271080	274280	like life picking on somebody who's already low status.
274280	278160	And hey, if you're one of those lib-left progressive types who is all sex-positive
278160	282600	and kinky, but still thinks hierarchy should be abolished, why do you like to be dominant
282600	284400	or be dominated in bed?
284400	285400	It's status.
285400	289240	It's enjoying your position in the sexual hierarchy of your relationship relative to
289240	290240	your partner.
290240	292120	There's no BDSM without hierarchy.
292120	295200	Our relationship with property is also a sign of hierarchy.
295200	298680	We are also hardwired to privilege our own stuff over other people's.
298680	302120	Think of how you sit on your own couch when you're relaxing, versus how you sit on your
302120	303960	friend's couch when you're going over for a visit.
303960	307120	How familiar do you feel in your own home versus somebody else's?
307120	311600	I bet you could describe every square meter of your place to me in detail, from that one
311600	315880	minor stain on the carpet that nobody notices, to that weird object on your desk.
315880	321280	But if you had to explain your friend's place to me, it would likely only be in broad strokes,
321280	323440	color of the walls or general locations of the furniture.
323440	325440	None of this stuff really needs to be taught to us either.
325440	329200	Sure, there's differences between each culture that needs to be figured out, but the framework
329200	331780	those differences sit atop of is biological.
331780	336380	We generally know how to act towards higher and lower status individuals, based on whether
336380	338700	or not we want to defer to them or confront them.
338700	342340	You wouldn't ask a restaurant manager for your bill, the same way that you'd ask him
342340	343340	for a job.
343340	348140	When meeting a new person, the common icebreaker question of what do you do is meant, at least
348140	350860	in part, to be a way to figure out status.
350860	354500	Not in some medieval sense, where the farmer should not dare speak to the king.
354500	357580	But there's certainly a feeling out of how you want to be treated, and how you should
357580	359180	treat the other person in return.
359180	363260	It's why you might feel nervous after engaging in random conversation with somebody you've
363260	367460	never met at the office party, only to be later told that it's the company VP, somebody
367460	369600	50 ranks above you that you've never met.
369600	373380	It's also why, when you have an unorthodox job, people suddenly don't quite know how
373380	374380	to treat you.
374380	379420	Now, even though high status individuals are climbing hierarchies, releasing more serotonin,
379420	383300	feeling better about themselves, and even living longer, that doesn't mean that it's
383300	385340	good to be high status all the time.
385340	386340	It's actually not.
386340	390660	In the student-teacher hierarchy, the student is lower status, but actually stands to benefit
390660	392220	more from their interaction.
392220	397340	An attitude and posture of low status is helpful when attempting to apologize to somebody.
397340	401100	That's why all of those celebrity apologies seem fake, no matter how hard they try.
401100	406520	We view them as so high status that their apologies naturally feel insincere, even as
406520	409160	they lose status right before our very eyes.
409160	413600	The lobster who loses the dominance dispute might be low on serotonin, but he didn't die
413600	418020	during the fight, and sometimes living to fight another day is more important than winning
418020	419020	right now.
419020	423060	So, even though high status in a hierarchy is preferable, there's still utility in
423060	428120	being low status, and moving up a hierarchy generates feelings of meaning, while watching
428120	431860	others move in either direction in a hierarchy generates pleasure of all types.
431860	436380	Clearly, we cannot just do away with hierarchy, nor can we exist in hierarchies that are too
436380	437380	rigid.
437380	442140	A dominance hierarchy is one where positions in the hierarchy are, for the most part, immutable.
442140	446300	Everybody slots into their rightful place, and it's extremely hard to move up or down.
446300	449580	Often times positions are determined by birthright, and if there's movement between them it's
449580	451080	due to brute force.
451080	454540	Prestige in a dominance hierarchy, therefore, is based on naked power.
454540	458140	To contrast, a competence hierarchy is one where positions are malleable.
458140	460520	Promotions within the hierarchy are based on skill.
460520	464300	Prestige in competence hierarchies is awarded voluntarily by those who are above you, and
464300	466360	it's expected for you to do the same for those below.
466360	468500	A competence hierarchy is meritocratic.
468500	470420	So I'm going to pose a question to you.
470420	473900	How does somebody with no skill compete in a competence hierarchy?
473900	476120	Well, there seems to be two ways.
476120	477520	The first way is through hard work.
477520	480500	Learning skills is hard, it takes time and effort, but you can rise through the ranks
480500	482420	based on your own merits given enough time.
482420	486280	This method of setting up a hierarchy is the most compatible with the liberal form of government,
486280	491900	and most centrists, center-left, center-right, non-extremists, grillists thrive within it.
491900	495380	The second way is to corrupt a competence hierarchy into a dominance one.
495380	499120	Those people who advocate for the abolishment of hierarchies end up doing this as well,
499120	501000	since it's, you know, impossible.
501000	505600	If you're somebody who's unskilled, but good at violence and extortion, a good strategy
505600	507980	for climbing a competence hierarchy is to corrupt it.
507980	512000	If you hear somebody saying that meritocracy isn't real, or it's a tool of the enemy,
512000	515680	and we should be empowering people based on immutable characteristics, they're trying
515680	517420	to subvert a competence hierarchy.
517420	520920	If you hear somebody talking about how it's important to normalize political violence
520920	524740	in order to enact their social change, how there's no middle ground, you're either
524740	528720	with us or against us, they're also trying to subvert a competence hierarchy.
528720	532400	This applies equally to the right and the left, and the collectivists, authoritarians,
532400	536820	and radicals from both sides see the competence hierarchy as fertile ground for subversion
536820	537980	towards their cause.
537980	541740	The left sees no difference between competence hierarchies and dominance hierarchies, and
541740	544380	rejects them both on that same faulty premise.
544380	548940	The right abuses humanity's natural proclivity towards hierarchies to try and set up hierarchies
548940	549940	of dominance.
549940	551860	Resist them both, simple as.
551860	552980	We need hierarchy.
552980	557460	We're hardwired to want them, and to derive both pleasure and meaning from our position
557460	558460	in them.
558460	561500	But we've also got an obligation to keep our eyes open, to oppose the corrupting elements
561500	562580	that creep into them.
562580	567680	The only valid hierarchy is competence, as it's maintained through respect, consent,
567680	568680	and humility.
568680	573880	All others require treachery, violence, and caste, and their advocates are more than willing
573880	575400	to impose that on you.
575400	578660	Alright my friends, thanks for watching the video, I hope you enjoyed it.
578660	582560	As always, streaming again tonight on twitch.tv slash game boomers, it's going to be more
582560	586640	American McGee's Alice, cause you know, Halloween, so make sure you drop by, hopefully I'll
586640	587640	see you there.
587640	588920	Have a good one, I love you.
591500	603340	Bye.
