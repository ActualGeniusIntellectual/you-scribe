1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
10.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,240
Humanity seems to be hardwired for hierarchy.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,960
I don't just mean that in the Petersonian way, but there's certainly that.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,440
That's the source of the Jordan Peterson lobster meme.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,000
Peterson pointed out that when two lobsters engage in a dominance dispute, the loser deflates

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,280
and the winner puffs himself out.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,040
A brain mechanism in both lobsters helps make more serotonin available to the winner of

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,640
the dispute, and less serotonin available to the loser.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,280
To make his point, he references a 1997 study where serotonin was injected into the subordinate,

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,640
freely moving lobster, meaning that the lobster was a recent loser of a dominance dispute,

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,400
but not so wounded from the encounter that he couldn't fight again.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,800
The injection of the serotonin resulted in a renewed willingness on behalf of the subordinate

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,360
lobsters to engage the dominant lobsters in further agonistic encounters, but did not

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,280
actually change who initiated the encounter, how they fought, how quickly the fight escalated,

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,440
or who ultimately won.

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,120
In other words, the serotonin did not increase the lobster's ability to fight, only his willingness

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
to.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,460
It took the edge off the bruised ego from the last encounter, basically.

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,720
And Peterson's argument is that even though humanity diverged from lobsters evolutionarily

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,020
350 million years ago, serotonin plays the same role in humans as it does in lobsters,

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,520
and in many other animals too.

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,080
When humans win or lose in a dominance dispute, serotonin goes up or down.

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,720
There you go, I've just given you Jordan Peterson's argument using the original research.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,640
If you ever have to talk to somebody who hates hearing the name Jordan Peterson, just show

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,880
him this study instead.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,360
But Peterson's way of looking at the topic is pretty simple.

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,480
Presumably because whenever we've heard his stuff, it's been in a YouTube video

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,020
of one of his lectures where he's giving information that is sufficiently low resolution

29
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,160
enough to get the idea across to a large crowd of people of varying backgrounds.

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,680
So let's dig into it a little bit more.

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,880
A lot of leftist thought revolves around the abolition of hierarchy due to it being a source

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
of oppression.

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,120
Marx's communism was envisioned as a moneyless, stateless, classless society, a society without

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
hierarchy.

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,040
He also aims towards statelessness and classlessness.

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,160
The market socialists view a large part of the hierarchies found in employment to be

37
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,440
unjust, especially where private owners are at the top.

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,080
Even the authoritarian socialists like to appeal to the abolition of hierarchy in their

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,560
rhetoric, though they never actually do it in practice.

40
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,820
Of course, none of them actually do it in practice.

41
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,400
The idea of abolishing the concept of hierarchy in a species which has a serotonergic system

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,000
in their brains to keep track of relative status among others is a fool's errand.

43
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,600
It will never happen and those attempts to do it are, in fact, bad for us.

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,100
But that doesn't mean that we're just cogs in the machine slotting into our proper place

45
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,100
either.

46
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,440
That's the fascist view on hierarchy.

47
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,200
The fascist idea of corporatism was not ruled by private corporation as we understand it

48
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
today.

49
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,240
It was the idea that the corporative state would be one in which the economy was managed

50
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,440
by representatives of employers, workers, and the party, and the state would direct

51
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,640
production to ensure that it remains in the national interest.

52
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,480
The fascist wanted to achieve a rational ordering of society through social control of the means

53
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,360
of production, just like the Marxists.

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,880
But where the Marxists wanted it achieved through worker control of the means of production

55
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,360
and the abolishment of social classes, fascists wanted it achieved by incorporating all people

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,200
and property, all public and private, all proletariat and bourgeoisie, into the state

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
itself.

58
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Everybody had their place in the state hierarchy, and when everybody took their place, the fascist

59
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,800
utopia would be achieved, according to their theory anyway.

60
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,640
After fascism was gone, this tendency would be called class collaborationism by the Marxists.

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,860
For humans, hierarchy certainly exists.

62
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,200
We cannot do away with it as the Marxists would like.

63
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,680
We also can't exist in perpetuity in an unchanging, purely authoritarian hierarchy

64
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,080
as the fascists would like.

65
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,200
The Marxists are wrong in being anti-hierarchy, but the fascists are wrong in believing that

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,020
hierarchy should be immutable.

67
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,400
What they're both missing is the fact that almost all of life's pains and pleasures

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,720
come down to movement within a hierarchy.

69
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,640
What motivates you at any given moment is moving through some hierarchy.

70
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,120
What entertains you is watching others move through hierarchy too, and that doesn't

71
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,540
necessarily mean moving upward in perpetuity.

72
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,520
Why is watching your sports team win a game exhilarating?

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,860
Because we're watching the winners increase in status relative to the losers.

74
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:04,800
Why is watching a comedian who depreciates himself in front of his audience funny?

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,220
Because we're watching the comedian decrease in status for our entertainment.

76
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,440
Why is watching a person who acts like he's a 10 out of 10, but obviously isn't, strike

77
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,160
out spectacularly with a woman, so cringe-inducing?

78
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,120
Because he believes he's at one level of status, but he's actually at another.

79
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,000
Why is it that we want to watch a swaggering bully fall down the stairs, but not a 90-year-old

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,040
grandma who can barely walk?

81
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,080
Because the former is perceived as a justified reduction of status, while the latter feels

82
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,280
like life picking on somebody who's already low status.

83
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,160
And hey, if you're one of those lib-left progressive types who is all sex-positive

84
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,600
and kinky, but still thinks hierarchy should be abolished, why do you like to be dominant

85
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,400
or be dominated in bed?

86
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
It's status.

87
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,240
It's enjoying your position in the sexual hierarchy of your relationship relative to

88
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
your partner.

89
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,120
There's no BDSM without hierarchy.

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,200
Our relationship with property is also a sign of hierarchy.

91
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,680
We are also hardwired to privilege our own stuff over other people's.

92
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,120
Think of how you sit on your own couch when you're relaxing, versus how you sit on your

93
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,960
friend's couch when you're going over for a visit.

94
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,120
How familiar do you feel in your own home versus somebody else's?

95
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,600
I bet you could describe every square meter of your place to me in detail, from that one

96
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,880
minor stain on the carpet that nobody notices, to that weird object on your desk.

97
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,280
But if you had to explain your friend's place to me, it would likely only be in broad strokes,

98
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
color of the walls or general locations of the furniture.

99
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
None of this stuff really needs to be taught to us either.

100
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,200
Sure, there's differences between each culture that needs to be figured out, but the framework

101
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,780
those differences sit atop of is biological.

102
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,380
We generally know how to act towards higher and lower status individuals, based on whether

103
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,700
or not we want to defer to them or confront them.

104
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,340
You wouldn't ask a restaurant manager for your bill, the same way that you'd ask him

105
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,340
for a job.

106
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,140
When meeting a new person, the common icebreaker question of what do you do is meant, at least

107
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,860
in part, to be a way to figure out status.

108
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,500
Not in some medieval sense, where the farmer should not dare speak to the king.

109
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,580
But there's certainly a feeling out of how you want to be treated, and how you should

110
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,180
treat the other person in return.

111
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,260
It's why you might feel nervous after engaging in random conversation with somebody you've

112
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,460
never met at the office party, only to be later told that it's the company VP, somebody

113
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,600
50 ranks above you that you've never met.

114
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,380
It's also why, when you have an unorthodox job, people suddenly don't quite know how

115
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
to treat you.

116
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,420
Now, even though high status individuals are climbing hierarchies, releasing more serotonin,

117
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,300
feeling better about themselves, and even living longer, that doesn't mean that it's

118
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,340
good to be high status all the time.

119
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,340
It's actually not.

120
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,660
In the student-teacher hierarchy, the student is lower status, but actually stands to benefit

121
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,220
more from their interaction.

122
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,340
An attitude and posture of low status is helpful when attempting to apologize to somebody.

123
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,100
That's why all of those celebrity apologies seem fake, no matter how hard they try.

124
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,520
We view them as so high status that their apologies naturally feel insincere, even as

125
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,160
they lose status right before our very eyes.

126
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,600
The lobster who loses the dominance dispute might be low on serotonin, but he didn't die

127
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,020
during the fight, and sometimes living to fight another day is more important than winning

128
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,020
right now.

129
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,060
So, even though high status in a hierarchy is preferable, there's still utility in

130
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,120
being low status, and moving up a hierarchy generates feelings of meaning, while watching

131
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,860
others move in either direction in a hierarchy generates pleasure of all types.

132
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,380
Clearly, we cannot just do away with hierarchy, nor can we exist in hierarchies that are too

133
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,380
rigid.

134
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,140
A dominance hierarchy is one where positions in the hierarchy are, for the most part, immutable.

135
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,300
Everybody slots into their rightful place, and it's extremely hard to move up or down.

136
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,580
Often times positions are determined by birthright, and if there's movement between them it's

137
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,080
due to brute force.

138
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,540
Prestige in a dominance hierarchy, therefore, is based on naked power.

139
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,140
To contrast, a competence hierarchy is one where positions are malleable.

140
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,520
Promotions within the hierarchy are based on skill.

141
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,300
Prestige in competence hierarchies is awarded voluntarily by those who are above you, and

142
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,360
it's expected for you to do the same for those below.

143
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,500
A competence hierarchy is meritocratic.

144
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,420
So I'm going to pose a question to you.

145
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,900
How does somebody with no skill compete in a competence hierarchy?

146
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,120
Well, there seems to be two ways.

147
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,520
The first way is through hard work.

148
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,500
Learning skills is hard, it takes time and effort, but you can rise through the ranks

149
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,420
based on your own merits given enough time.

150
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,280
This method of setting up a hierarchy is the most compatible with the liberal form of government,

151
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,900
and most centrists, center-left, center-right, non-extremists, grillists thrive within it.

152
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,380
The second way is to corrupt a competence hierarchy into a dominance one.

153
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,120
Those people who advocate for the abolishment of hierarchies end up doing this as well,

154
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,000
since it's, you know, impossible.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,600
If you're somebody who's unskilled, but good at violence and extortion, a good strategy

156
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,980
for climbing a competence hierarchy is to corrupt it.

157
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,000
If you hear somebody saying that meritocracy isn't real, or it's a tool of the enemy,

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,680
and we should be empowering people based on immutable characteristics, they're trying

159
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,420
to subvert a competence hierarchy.

160
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,920
If you hear somebody talking about how it's important to normalize political violence

161
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,740
in order to enact their social change, how there's no middle ground, you're either

162
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,720
with us or against us, they're also trying to subvert a competence hierarchy.

163
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,400
This applies equally to the right and the left, and the collectivists, authoritarians,

164
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,820
and radicals from both sides see the competence hierarchy as fertile ground for subversion

165
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,980
towards their cause.

166
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,740
The left sees no difference between competence hierarchies and dominance hierarchies, and

167
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,380
rejects them both on that same faulty premise.

168
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,940
The right abuses humanity's natural proclivity towards hierarchies to try and set up hierarchies

169
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,940
of dominance.

170
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,860
Resist them both, simple as.

171
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,980
We need hierarchy.

172
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,460
We're hardwired to want them, and to derive both pleasure and meaning from our position

173
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,460
in them.

174
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,500
But we've also got an obligation to keep our eyes open, to oppose the corrupting elements

175
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,580
that creep into them.

176
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,680
The only valid hierarchy is competence, as it's maintained through respect, consent,

177
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
and humility.

178
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,880
All others require treachery, violence, and caste, and their advocates are more than willing

179
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,400
to impose that on you.

180
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,660
Alright my friends, thanks for watching the video, I hope you enjoyed it.

181
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,560
As always, streaming again tonight on twitch.tv slash game boomers, it's going to be more

182
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,640
American McGee's Alice, cause you know, Halloween, so make sure you drop by, hopefully I'll

183
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
see you there.

184
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,920
Have a good one, I love you.

185
00:09:51,500 --> 00:10:03,340
Bye.
