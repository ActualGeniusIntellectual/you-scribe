00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
10.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.240
Humanity seems to be hardwired for hierarchy.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.960
I don't just mean that in the Petersonian way, but there's certainly that.

00:11.960 --> 00:14.440
That's the source of the Jordan Peterson lobster meme.

00:14.440 --> 00:19.000
Peterson pointed out that when two lobsters engage in a dominance dispute, the loser deflates

00:19.000 --> 00:20.280
and the winner puffs himself out.

00:20.280 --> 00:25.040
A brain mechanism in both lobsters helps make more serotonin available to the winner of

00:25.040 --> 00:27.640
the dispute, and less serotonin available to the loser.

00:27.640 --> 00:33.280
To make his point, he references a 1997 study where serotonin was injected into the subordinate,

00:33.280 --> 00:37.640
freely moving lobster, meaning that the lobster was a recent loser of a dominance dispute,

00:37.640 --> 00:40.400
but not so wounded from the encounter that he couldn't fight again.

00:40.400 --> 00:44.800
The injection of the serotonin resulted in a renewed willingness on behalf of the subordinate

00:44.800 --> 00:49.360
lobsters to engage the dominant lobsters in further agonistic encounters, but did not

00:49.360 --> 00:54.280
actually change who initiated the encounter, how they fought, how quickly the fight escalated,

00:54.280 --> 00:55.440
or who ultimately won.

00:55.440 --> 01:00.120
In other words, the serotonin did not increase the lobster's ability to fight, only his willingness

01:00.120 --> 01:01.120
to.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.460
It took the edge off the bruised ego from the last encounter, basically.

01:03.460 --> 01:07.720
And Peterson's argument is that even though humanity diverged from lobsters evolutionarily

01:07.720 --> 01:13.020
350 million years ago, serotonin plays the same role in humans as it does in lobsters,

01:13.020 --> 01:14.520
and in many other animals too.

01:14.520 --> 01:18.080
When humans win or lose in a dominance dispute, serotonin goes up or down.

01:18.080 --> 01:21.720
There you go, I've just given you Jordan Peterson's argument using the original research.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.640
If you ever have to talk to somebody who hates hearing the name Jordan Peterson, just show

01:24.640 --> 01:25.880
him this study instead.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.360
But Peterson's way of looking at the topic is pretty simple.

01:28.360 --> 01:31.480
Presumably because whenever we've heard his stuff, it's been in a YouTube video

01:31.480 --> 01:35.020
of one of his lectures where he's giving information that is sufficiently low resolution

01:35.020 --> 01:39.160
enough to get the idea across to a large crowd of people of varying backgrounds.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.680
So let's dig into it a little bit more.

01:40.680 --> 01:44.880
A lot of leftist thought revolves around the abolition of hierarchy due to it being a source

01:44.880 --> 01:45.880
of oppression.

01:45.880 --> 01:51.120
Marx's communism was envisioned as a moneyless, stateless, classless society, a society without

01:51.120 --> 01:52.120
hierarchy.

01:52.120 --> 01:55.040
He also aims towards statelessness and classlessness.

01:55.040 --> 01:59.160
The market socialists view a large part of the hierarchies found in employment to be

01:59.160 --> 02:02.440
unjust, especially where private owners are at the top.

02:02.440 --> 02:07.080
Even the authoritarian socialists like to appeal to the abolition of hierarchy in their

02:07.080 --> 02:09.560
rhetoric, though they never actually do it in practice.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.820
Of course, none of them actually do it in practice.

02:11.820 --> 02:16.400
The idea of abolishing the concept of hierarchy in a species which has a serotonergic system

02:16.400 --> 02:21.000
in their brains to keep track of relative status among others is a fool's errand.

02:21.040 --> 02:24.600
It will never happen and those attempts to do it are, in fact, bad for us.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.100
But that doesn't mean that we're just cogs in the machine slotting into our proper place

02:28.100 --> 02:29.100
either.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.440
That's the fascist view on hierarchy.

02:30.440 --> 02:35.200
The fascist idea of corporatism was not ruled by private corporation as we understand it

02:35.200 --> 02:36.200
today.

02:36.200 --> 02:40.240
It was the idea that the corporative state would be one in which the economy was managed

02:40.240 --> 02:44.440
by representatives of employers, workers, and the party, and the state would direct

02:44.440 --> 02:47.640
production to ensure that it remains in the national interest.

02:47.640 --> 02:52.480
The fascist wanted to achieve a rational ordering of society through social control of the means

02:52.480 --> 02:54.360
of production, just like the Marxists.

02:54.360 --> 02:57.880
But where the Marxists wanted it achieved through worker control of the means of production

02:57.880 --> 03:02.360
and the abolishment of social classes, fascists wanted it achieved by incorporating all people

03:02.360 --> 03:07.200
and property, all public and private, all proletariat and bourgeoisie, into the state

03:07.200 --> 03:08.200
itself.

03:08.200 --> 03:12.200
Everybody had their place in the state hierarchy, and when everybody took their place, the fascist

03:12.200 --> 03:15.800
utopia would be achieved, according to their theory anyway.

03:15.800 --> 03:21.640
After fascism was gone, this tendency would be called class collaborationism by the Marxists.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.860
For humans, hierarchy certainly exists.

03:23.860 --> 03:26.200
We cannot do away with it as the Marxists would like.

03:26.200 --> 03:30.680
We also can't exist in perpetuity in an unchanging, purely authoritarian hierarchy

03:30.680 --> 03:32.080
as the fascists would like.

03:32.080 --> 03:36.200
The Marxists are wrong in being anti-hierarchy, but the fascists are wrong in believing that

03:36.200 --> 03:38.020
hierarchy should be immutable.

03:38.020 --> 03:42.400
What they're both missing is the fact that almost all of life's pains and pleasures

03:42.400 --> 03:44.720
come down to movement within a hierarchy.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.640
What motivates you at any given moment is moving through some hierarchy.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.120
What entertains you is watching others move through hierarchy too, and that doesn't

03:52.120 --> 03:54.540
necessarily mean moving upward in perpetuity.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.520
Why is watching your sports team win a game exhilarating?

03:57.520 --> 04:00.860
Because we're watching the winners increase in status relative to the losers.

04:00.860 --> 04:04.800
Why is watching a comedian who depreciates himself in front of his audience funny?

04:04.800 --> 04:08.220
Because we're watching the comedian decrease in status for our entertainment.

04:08.220 --> 04:12.440
Why is watching a person who acts like he's a 10 out of 10, but obviously isn't, strike

04:12.440 --> 04:16.160
out spectacularly with a woman, so cringe-inducing?

04:16.160 --> 04:20.120
Because he believes he's at one level of status, but he's actually at another.

04:20.120 --> 04:25.000
Why is it that we want to watch a swaggering bully fall down the stairs, but not a 90-year-old

04:25.000 --> 04:27.040
grandma who can barely walk?

04:27.040 --> 04:31.080
Because the former is perceived as a justified reduction of status, while the latter feels

04:31.080 --> 04:34.280
like life picking on somebody who's already low status.

04:34.280 --> 04:38.160
And hey, if you're one of those lib-left progressive types who is all sex-positive

04:38.160 --> 04:42.600
and kinky, but still thinks hierarchy should be abolished, why do you like to be dominant

04:42.600 --> 04:44.400
or be dominated in bed?

04:44.400 --> 04:45.400
It's status.

04:45.400 --> 04:49.240
It's enjoying your position in the sexual hierarchy of your relationship relative to

04:49.240 --> 04:50.240
your partner.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.120
There's no BDSM without hierarchy.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.200
Our relationship with property is also a sign of hierarchy.

04:55.200 --> 04:58.680
We are also hardwired to privilege our own stuff over other people's.

04:58.680 --> 05:02.120
Think of how you sit on your own couch when you're relaxing, versus how you sit on your

05:02.120 --> 05:03.960
friend's couch when you're going over for a visit.

05:03.960 --> 05:07.120
How familiar do you feel in your own home versus somebody else's?

05:07.120 --> 05:11.600
I bet you could describe every square meter of your place to me in detail, from that one

05:11.600 --> 05:15.880
minor stain on the carpet that nobody notices, to that weird object on your desk.

05:15.880 --> 05:21.280
But if you had to explain your friend's place to me, it would likely only be in broad strokes,

05:21.280 --> 05:23.440
color of the walls or general locations of the furniture.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.440
None of this stuff really needs to be taught to us either.

05:25.440 --> 05:29.200
Sure, there's differences between each culture that needs to be figured out, but the framework

05:29.200 --> 05:31.780
those differences sit atop of is biological.

05:31.780 --> 05:36.380
We generally know how to act towards higher and lower status individuals, based on whether

05:36.380 --> 05:38.700
or not we want to defer to them or confront them.

05:38.700 --> 05:42.340
You wouldn't ask a restaurant manager for your bill, the same way that you'd ask him

05:42.340 --> 05:43.340
for a job.

05:43.340 --> 05:48.140
When meeting a new person, the common icebreaker question of what do you do is meant, at least

05:48.140 --> 05:50.860
in part, to be a way to figure out status.

05:50.860 --> 05:54.500
Not in some medieval sense, where the farmer should not dare speak to the king.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.580
But there's certainly a feeling out of how you want to be treated, and how you should

05:57.580 --> 05:59.180
treat the other person in return.

05:59.180 --> 06:03.260
It's why you might feel nervous after engaging in random conversation with somebody you've

06:03.260 --> 06:07.460
never met at the office party, only to be later told that it's the company VP, somebody

06:07.460 --> 06:09.600
50 ranks above you that you've never met.

06:09.600 --> 06:13.380
It's also why, when you have an unorthodox job, people suddenly don't quite know how

06:13.380 --> 06:14.380
to treat you.

06:14.380 --> 06:19.420
Now, even though high status individuals are climbing hierarchies, releasing more serotonin,

06:19.420 --> 06:23.300
feeling better about themselves, and even living longer, that doesn't mean that it's

06:23.300 --> 06:25.340
good to be high status all the time.

06:25.340 --> 06:26.340
It's actually not.

06:26.340 --> 06:30.660
In the student-teacher hierarchy, the student is lower status, but actually stands to benefit

06:30.660 --> 06:32.220
more from their interaction.

06:32.220 --> 06:37.340
An attitude and posture of low status is helpful when attempting to apologize to somebody.

06:37.340 --> 06:41.100
That's why all of those celebrity apologies seem fake, no matter how hard they try.

06:41.100 --> 06:46.520
We view them as so high status that their apologies naturally feel insincere, even as

06:46.520 --> 06:49.160
they lose status right before our very eyes.

06:49.160 --> 06:53.600
The lobster who loses the dominance dispute might be low on serotonin, but he didn't die

06:53.600 --> 06:58.020
during the fight, and sometimes living to fight another day is more important than winning

06:58.020 --> 06:59.020
right now.

06:59.020 --> 07:03.060
So, even though high status in a hierarchy is preferable, there's still utility in

07:03.060 --> 07:08.120
being low status, and moving up a hierarchy generates feelings of meaning, while watching

07:08.120 --> 07:11.860
others move in either direction in a hierarchy generates pleasure of all types.

07:11.860 --> 07:16.380
Clearly, we cannot just do away with hierarchy, nor can we exist in hierarchies that are too

07:16.380 --> 07:17.380
rigid.

07:17.380 --> 07:22.140
A dominance hierarchy is one where positions in the hierarchy are, for the most part, immutable.

07:22.140 --> 07:26.300
Everybody slots into their rightful place, and it's extremely hard to move up or down.

07:26.300 --> 07:29.580
Often times positions are determined by birthright, and if there's movement between them it's

07:29.580 --> 07:31.080
due to brute force.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.540
Prestige in a dominance hierarchy, therefore, is based on naked power.

07:34.540 --> 07:38.140
To contrast, a competence hierarchy is one where positions are malleable.

07:38.140 --> 07:40.520
Promotions within the hierarchy are based on skill.

07:40.520 --> 07:44.300
Prestige in competence hierarchies is awarded voluntarily by those who are above you, and

07:44.300 --> 07:46.360
it's expected for you to do the same for those below.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.500
A competence hierarchy is meritocratic.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.420
So I'm going to pose a question to you.

07:50.420 --> 07:53.900
How does somebody with no skill compete in a competence hierarchy?

07:53.900 --> 07:56.120
Well, there seems to be two ways.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.520
The first way is through hard work.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.500
Learning skills is hard, it takes time and effort, but you can rise through the ranks

08:00.500 --> 08:02.420
based on your own merits given enough time.

08:02.420 --> 08:06.280
This method of setting up a hierarchy is the most compatible with the liberal form of government,

08:06.280 --> 08:11.900
and most centrists, center-left, center-right, non-extremists, grillists thrive within it.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.380
The second way is to corrupt a competence hierarchy into a dominance one.

08:15.380 --> 08:19.120
Those people who advocate for the abolishment of hierarchies end up doing this as well,

08:19.120 --> 08:21.000
since it's, you know, impossible.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.600
If you're somebody who's unskilled, but good at violence and extortion, a good strategy

08:25.600 --> 08:27.980
for climbing a competence hierarchy is to corrupt it.

08:27.980 --> 08:32.000
If you hear somebody saying that meritocracy isn't real, or it's a tool of the enemy,

08:32.000 --> 08:35.680
and we should be empowering people based on immutable characteristics, they're trying

08:35.680 --> 08:37.420
to subvert a competence hierarchy.

08:37.420 --> 08:40.920
If you hear somebody talking about how it's important to normalize political violence

08:40.920 --> 08:44.740
in order to enact their social change, how there's no middle ground, you're either

08:44.740 --> 08:48.720
with us or against us, they're also trying to subvert a competence hierarchy.

08:48.720 --> 08:52.400
This applies equally to the right and the left, and the collectivists, authoritarians,

08:52.400 --> 08:56.820
and radicals from both sides see the competence hierarchy as fertile ground for subversion

08:56.820 --> 08:57.980
towards their cause.

08:57.980 --> 09:01.740
The left sees no difference between competence hierarchies and dominance hierarchies, and

09:01.740 --> 09:04.380
rejects them both on that same faulty premise.

09:04.380 --> 09:08.940
The right abuses humanity's natural proclivity towards hierarchies to try and set up hierarchies

09:08.940 --> 09:09.940
of dominance.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.860
Resist them both, simple as.

09:11.860 --> 09:12.980
We need hierarchy.

09:12.980 --> 09:17.460
We're hardwired to want them, and to derive both pleasure and meaning from our position

09:17.460 --> 09:18.460
in them.

09:18.460 --> 09:21.500
But we've also got an obligation to keep our eyes open, to oppose the corrupting elements

09:21.500 --> 09:22.580
that creep into them.

09:22.580 --> 09:27.680
The only valid hierarchy is competence, as it's maintained through respect, consent,

09:27.680 --> 09:28.680
and humility.

09:28.680 --> 09:33.880
All others require treachery, violence, and caste, and their advocates are more than willing

09:33.880 --> 09:35.400
to impose that on you.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.660
Alright my friends, thanks for watching the video, I hope you enjoyed it.

09:38.660 --> 09:42.560
As always, streaming again tonight on twitch.tv slash game boomers, it's going to be more

09:42.560 --> 09:46.640
American McGee's Alice, cause you know, Halloween, so make sure you drop by, hopefully I'll

09:46.640 --> 09:47.640
see you there.

09:47.640 --> 09:48.920
Have a good one, I love you.

09:51.500 --> 10:03.340
Bye.
