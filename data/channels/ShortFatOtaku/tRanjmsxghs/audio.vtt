WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.700
We cannot prove that we cannot prove at all that there is some kind of political

00:04.700 --> 00:10.020
motivation or some kind of concerted effort to, uh, to take down Alex Jones,

00:10.200 --> 00:13.580
but we can be conspiracy theorists ourselves.

00:13.640 --> 00:18.220
We can stay up until 3 AM with like coffee and cigarettes and pinning things

00:18.220 --> 00:21.220
together on a board with tax and string like pictures.

00:21.220 --> 00:22.700
And we can do that too.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.380
We can be that crazy guy too.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.260
So maybe we should indulge a little bit.

00:26.300 --> 00:26.720
Okay.

00:27.140 --> 00:31.140
So this is an article from December of 2020.

00:31.860 --> 00:33.620
This is mostly regarding COVID stuff.

00:33.980 --> 00:36.880
How should you talk to your friends and relatives who

00:36.880 --> 00:38.280
believe in conspiracy theory?

00:38.280 --> 00:40.140
There is, this is like a lifestyle article.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.280
This is not a serious news piece.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.320
It's a fluff piece, but let's just, let's check it out.

00:44.320 --> 00:44.640
Okay.

00:45.640 --> 00:49.680
You're dreading the moment as your uncle passes the roast potatoes.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.920
He casually mentions that a coronavirus vaccine will be used to inject

00:53.920 --> 00:56.080
microchips into our bodies to track us.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.680
Or maybe it's the point when a friend after a couple of pints starts talking

01:00.680 --> 01:05.220
about how COVID-19 doesn't exist or when, or when pudding is ruined as a long lost

01:05.220 --> 01:11.440
cousin starts spinning lurid tales about QAnon and elite Satanists eating babies.

01:11.740 --> 01:12.500
Oh my God.

01:13.860 --> 01:15.860
So I think I recall this.

01:15.860 --> 01:20.140
It was like 2018 or 2019 Lilith, and you posted a tweet that

01:20.140 --> 01:21.560
inspired a video of mine.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.540
And the tweet was, it was a trans person waving the, the, the, the, the

01:26.540 --> 01:30.680
trans flag, and then having a turkey shoved on their hand in the other hand.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.260
You remember that?

01:36.840 --> 01:38.240
I don't remember that.

01:38.240 --> 01:38.840
What was that?

01:39.040 --> 01:39.300
Okay.

01:39.300 --> 01:39.720
Hold on.

01:40.720 --> 01:41.560
They have a turkey?

01:41.880 --> 01:42.160
Okay.

01:42.160 --> 01:42.960
So I can't find it.

01:42.960 --> 01:43.280
Shit.

01:43.680 --> 01:49.620
I did a video and the thumbnail of the video, there's a trans person with like

01:49.620 --> 01:54.460
brown skin and short purple hair, and they're screeching and they're waving

01:54.460 --> 01:59.980
a trans flag and they have a turkey shoved on their fist in the asshole of

01:59.980 --> 02:01.740
the turkey on the other one.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.860
And it was supposed to be like a trans Thanksgiving thing.

02:05.860 --> 02:06.940
There was that picture.

02:07.220 --> 02:09.460
And you posted that it was a drawing.

02:09.460 --> 02:10.000
It was a drawing.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.420
And someone took that.

02:12.160 --> 02:16.680
No, you took that picture post on your Twitter and you said, this is what these

02:16.680 --> 02:22.200
crazies want you to think trans people are, but we're not this, we're not this

02:22.200 --> 02:22.800
fucking crazy.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.120
I don't remember saying, I, I, sorry.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.520
I, I, it was like four years ago, were you remembering somebody else?

02:28.560 --> 02:29.760
Oh, no, it was, it was definitely you.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.520
I'm trying, I'm trying to remember the turkey.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.320
It was a cooked turkey.

02:34.320 --> 02:34.960
It was a cooked turkey.

02:35.640 --> 02:40.360
I don't, there's nothing like that in my mind, but you might be right.

02:41.240 --> 02:41.440
Okay.

02:41.440 --> 02:45.600
Can I, maybe if like I find a picture you'll know, Hey chat, can you guys

02:45.600 --> 02:46.560
like find that video?

02:46.720 --> 02:47.840
Oh, that one.

02:47.880 --> 02:48.240
Yeah.

02:48.880 --> 02:52.880
So you, you definitely took this and posted it on your Twitter back in the day.

02:53.640 --> 03:02.280
And you were like, yeah, that's such a, but it's such a, okay.

03:02.340 --> 03:06.960
So then the dream, why I feel like you've mentioned it.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.720
I was, I thought it was like, was this a fever dream?

03:11.040 --> 03:11.880
What the hell?

03:12.240 --> 03:15.720
So this, this image, it looks like it's a meme.

03:15.880 --> 03:21.320
It's a fucking joke, but it was used on ironically, it was used on ironically in

03:21.320 --> 03:26.240
like a pro trans Thanksgiving article where it's like how to confront your racist

03:26.240 --> 03:31.120
conservative uncle at Thanksgiving, how to shoot them down and it's like, chill

03:31.120 --> 03:32.400
the fuck out guys, like Jesus.

03:33.400 --> 03:40.080
Yeah, it was, it was used like, like why do you make, that's how you portray trans

03:40.080 --> 03:43.160
people, a crazy pink haired person.

03:43.760 --> 03:44.960
I mean, I'm sure some are.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.960
Fisting a turkey for fuck's sake.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.200
Fisting a turkey.

03:49.840 --> 03:54.400
So why, why, why are they fisting a turkey because their, uh, relatives

03:54.400 --> 03:57.880
drove them so crazy, I guess, but why?

03:58.920 --> 04:02.600
So I'm bringing that up because this article kind of plays off of that, you

04:02.600 --> 04:08.520
know, like how do you deal with crazies, crazies at the dinner table during

04:08.520 --> 04:11.360
holidays, you know, the uncle you only see once a year or whatever.

04:11.680 --> 04:20.120
Now, rather than this being about like LGBT stuff, this is about conspiracy

04:20.120 --> 04:20.640
theories.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.680
How do you deal with your uncle who thinks that a coronavirus vaccine will

04:24.680 --> 04:29.560
inject microchips into your bodies or talking about how COVID doesn't exist or

04:29.560 --> 04:31.400
QAnon or elite Satanists.

04:31.520 --> 04:36.120
Now, first of all, the left itself, they're also, they're also, uh, very in

04:36.120 --> 04:37.280
on the conspiracy theories.

04:37.600 --> 04:42.200
They talk about the globalist bourgeoisie 1%, you know, they, they talk about Bill

04:42.200 --> 04:45.560
Gates just as much like that's, it's not fucking pretend that there's not, this

04:45.560 --> 04:47.520
isn't like a, like a bipartisan thing.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.360
It certainly is.

04:48.600 --> 04:48.960
All right.

04:49.280 --> 04:54.440
But still, how do you talk about conspiracy theories, ruining your,

04:54.440 --> 04:55.920
your family get together?

04:55.960 --> 04:56.400
Okay.

04:56.720 --> 05:03.360
So this, this article gives you like, it's a keep calm, don't be dismissive,

05:03.600 --> 05:09.520
encourage critical thinking, ask questions, don't expect immediate results.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.000
Okay.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.040
So soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.000
So let's actually go, what you do is you play into it.

05:17.320 --> 05:17.640
Yeah.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.360
So you play into it.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.880
You, you, you go, you go even crazier.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.800
You go even crazier than, than your, than your relatives.

05:26.800 --> 05:32.600
You go, if they think, if they think like a fucking, if they think that

05:32.600 --> 05:38.480
nine 11 steel beams and shit, you just, just say the tower didn't even exist.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.720
The tower never existed.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.080
Tower.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.520
It never existed.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.320
I mean, has there been proof?

05:44.320 --> 05:49.600
Has anybody, has anybody seen the towers for 20 years?

05:50.080 --> 05:50.840
They vanished.

05:51.280 --> 05:51.640
Okay.

05:51.840 --> 05:58.320
So with Alex Jones being the primary conspiracy theorist peddler, we should

05:58.320 --> 05:59.880
look into some of these conspiracy theories.

05:59.880 --> 06:00.080
Okay.

06:00.080 --> 06:04.120
So for example, this was a good one.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.600
This was like, this is a surface level Alex Jonesery.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.080
Okay.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.440
Remember when Alex Jones said that whenever Silicon Valley gets called

06:10.440 --> 06:14.640
out on their shit, they just throw some Indian out in front to act confused

06:14.640 --> 06:16.320
and say that they don't think they're doing anything wrong.

06:16.600 --> 06:21.360
And that is exactly what Twitter did on the, on the Joe Rogan show a few years

06:21.360 --> 06:27.400
ago, where, uh, Jack showed up with, with this, this Indian woman who was like,

06:27.640 --> 06:28.760
we're, I don't know what you mean.

06:28.760 --> 06:29.640
We're, we're doing okay.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.600
Aren't we like, I don't understand, you know, like that was the meme, you

06:32.600 --> 06:34.400
know, three or four years ago, let's check this one out.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.600
This is from 2019.

06:35.600 --> 06:35.880
Okay.

06:35.880 --> 06:40.520
So about three years ago, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan war leads

06:40.520 --> 06:42.200
to conspiracy theory meltdown.

06:42.600 --> 06:47.360
Infowars host says that babies are being harvested for their organs.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.000
Okay.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.040
It seems pretty crazy, right?

06:51.040 --> 06:52.120
It seems pretty fucking crazy.

06:52.360 --> 06:52.640
Yeah.

06:53.120 --> 06:58.680
Sounds like sounds like Alex Jones, but then, but then.

07:00.160 --> 07:00.760
But then hold on.

07:01.760 --> 07:05.000
So after a recent feud, Jones has invited back on Joe Rogan's show while

07:05.000 --> 07:07.360
speaking with martial arts instructor Eddie Bravo, an episode uploaded on

07:07.360 --> 07:11.200
Wednesday, Jones began shouting about infanticide, I came here and I proved

07:11.200 --> 07:14.320
they're keeping babies alive and they're taking their organs, the Senate voted

07:14.320 --> 07:18.000
Monday to keep it legal, they fucking did it Bravo, and you can't fucking admit

07:18.000 --> 07:21.120
they're, they're killing already born kids, so you're telling me it isn't real

07:21.120 --> 07:24.960
when they had a fucking vote in the God, in the goddamn fucking Senate, that's

07:24.960 --> 07:29.000
the conspiracy theory that Bravo responds, I am ready to beat your fucking ass.

07:29.000 --> 07:29.680
Jones answers.

07:29.680 --> 07:30.720
You think you're fucking tough.

07:30.720 --> 07:31.360
You're about to get it.

07:31.360 --> 07:31.920
Bullshit.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.320
They're killing already born babies.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.400
Stop fucking lying.

07:34.400 --> 07:35.000
God fucking damn it.

07:35.000 --> 07:35.680
I'm getting pissed.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.920
So Jones is going off.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.600
Jones is fucking got a hinge at this point.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.600
I'll beat your fucking ass.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.240
He's fucking crazy.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.360
Um, when, when contact for comment and info wars representative sent

07:46.040 --> 07:48.640
Newsweek articles about late term abortion, including a slate report

07:48.640 --> 07:51.360
dating to 2012, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume

07:51.360 --> 07:53.320
that you're simply ignorant and not malicious, mentally challenged.

07:53.360 --> 07:53.760
Okay.

07:54.360 --> 07:57.200
So Alex Jones is ranting.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.160
This is back in 2019, clear conspiracy theorist.

08:00.640 --> 08:04.160
And this is going to be used to, uh, restrict, restrict abortion

08:04.160 --> 08:05.160
rights and all this shit.

08:05.480 --> 08:09.080
It's going to make people, you can already see the narrative unfold.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.480
This is what a leftoid would say is that Alex Jones need to be

08:11.480 --> 08:14.440
censors because he's going to make things worse for women.

08:14.520 --> 08:14.960
Okay.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.600
Well, what actually, what came out recently.

08:17.760 --> 08:21.720
So this came out, this came out, um, about a year ago, two

08:21.720 --> 08:25.120
years after this rant happened, federal government caught buying

08:25.160 --> 08:29.600
fresh flesh of aborted babies who could have survived as preemies.

08:31.320 --> 08:35.520
So the U S government has been buying and trafficking

08:35.520 --> 08:37.400
fresh aborted baby body parts.

08:37.400 --> 08:41.360
Now, if you, if you believe that if he is as a baby, then the whole,

08:41.360 --> 08:44.760
they're killing babies for their body parts, that language makes sense here.

08:45.280 --> 08:50.840
So, um, these body parts purchased by the U S food and drug administration

08:50.840 --> 08:55.960
to humanize mice and test biologic drugs in scientific experiments came

08:55.960 --> 09:00.040
from babies up to 24 weeks old in gestation, just weeks from being born.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.400
Uh, okay.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.280
That's kind of crazy.

09:08.080 --> 09:12.560
So records indicate that ABR waste not want not.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.240
Waste not want not.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.480
So they were going to get aborted anyways.

09:17.520 --> 09:17.720
Yeah.

09:18.600 --> 09:25.640
Um, so the company, so there's a company called ABR that makes millions.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.800
This company makes millions every year by harvesting organs, like lungs,

09:31.040 --> 09:35.440
livers, eyeballs, and brains from aborted babies and reselling them at profit.

09:35.960 --> 09:40.600
ABR was paid $12,000 upfront per per box of babies.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.080
Some of them were survivable outside of the womb.

09:43.280 --> 09:47.120
Between the gestational age of 16 to 24 weeks, most purchases are

09:47.120 --> 09:49.640
for intact thymuses and livers.

09:50.120 --> 09:50.480
Yeah.

09:51.120 --> 09:55.560
Intact thymuses and liver and livers shipped fresh and on wet ice.

09:57.160 --> 10:01.600
The FDA doctor with the callousness of picking a cut of meat from a butcher

10:01.600 --> 10:05.600
shop, an FDA doctor request tissue samples be procured from a baby boy.

10:05.600 --> 10:09.360
As they claim, it is strongly preferred to have a male fetus if at all possible,

10:09.920 --> 10:12.440
but undetermined sex or female is better than no tissue.

10:13.080 --> 10:13.520
Okay.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.680
So there's, there's, there's this stuff.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.960
Now this, this is from the Federalist and the Federalist has,

10:19.960 --> 10:21.440
has a right wing slant for sure.

10:21.440 --> 10:25.040
So maybe, you know, maybe this is just like, who knows, right?

10:25.040 --> 10:25.760
So we can keep going.

10:26.160 --> 10:26.920
Here's Fox.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.920
Fox is a more mainstream right-wing source, and this is six months later.

10:31.360 --> 10:36.320
Um, six months after this previous report, millions in federal money

10:36.320 --> 10:42.240
flowed to a tissue bank that collected fetal heart gonads, gonads, legs, and brain.

10:42.720 --> 10:46.880
And this, this report came from the university university of Pittsburgh.

10:48.040 --> 10:48.360
Yeah.

10:48.760 --> 10:52.480
So the university of Pittsburgh, the department of health and human services

10:52.480 --> 10:56.120
has funneled at least $2.7 million into a university of Pittsburgh project

10:56.400 --> 10:58.320
that utilizes a tissue bank with Oregon's.

10:58.600 --> 10:58.880
Okay.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.720
So there's like, there's multiple organizations doing this

11:01.720 --> 11:02.640
sort of thing right now.

11:02.680 --> 11:03.040
Okay.

11:03.840 --> 11:09.400
Um, I mean, yeah, it's, it's pretty, it's pretty oof.

11:09.400 --> 11:18.520
Um, so Trump, Trump put a ban on it in 2019.

11:19.080 --> 11:19.560
He banned it.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.680
And this came out of the national library of medicine.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.480
It was just basically a paper signed by some researchers who were

11:27.800 --> 11:29.440
saying that we should not ban it.

11:29.800 --> 11:33.520
And they were saying like this, this tissue is being aborted anyway.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.640
Abortion is still legal in the United States.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.320
And so as long as it's being aborted anyway, this tissue actually

11:38.320 --> 11:39.800
is useful in medical experiments.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.200
There have been good things to come out of it because there's

11:42.200 --> 11:45.800
various medicines and studies and, and, and, and, and whatever the case

11:45.800 --> 11:49.720
may be new data has come out of that has been come out of examining this stuff.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.880
So we shouldn't be stopping it for a moral reason like that, because

11:52.880 --> 11:53.880
they're getting aborted anyway.

11:54.200 --> 11:58.040
And that was their point of view at the, um, at the national library for medicine.

11:58.040 --> 12:01.400
So they, they wrote this paper saying here, we, the undersigned believe

12:01.400 --> 12:04.880
that we should be able to use this, this tissue to solve these problems.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.760
And they mentioned some HIV research that mentioned some other research.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.640
So it's like, okay, fair enough.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.960
Like there is obviously a benefit here.

12:10.360 --> 12:20.760
Um, and then this happened April, 2021 Biden's national Institute of Health

12:20.760 --> 12:24.680
has officially rescinded the ban on using fetal tissues and research on Friday.

12:24.960 --> 12:29.640
So Trump banned it in 2019, Biden unbanned it in 2021.

12:30.080 --> 12:34.280
So there's probably going to be a partisan going back and forth on the use of

12:34.280 --> 12:36.280
these, these body parts for some time.

12:36.520 --> 12:42.000
But the point being is that everyone was calling Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist

12:42.160 --> 12:46.360
back when he yelled and screeched this on the Joe Rogan show, but it turned

12:46.360 --> 12:48.440
out to be at least kind of correct.

12:50.720 --> 12:54.480
And that's the important part is that like, like you, you can, you can move

12:54.480 --> 12:58.400
the goalposts and say, okay, it's true, but we just think it's good.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.480
That's it, but yeah, exactly.

13:02.560 --> 13:07.360
So like the, the, we do it and it's good conversation is a different conversation

13:07.360 --> 13:08.880
than the, we don't do it conversation.

13:09.480 --> 13:10.720
So they were saying, we don't do this.

13:10.720 --> 13:11.480
It's so crazy.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.400
Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist, but it turns out he was

13:13.400 --> 13:14.280
kind of right in that one.

13:14.680 --> 13:15.040
All right.

13:16.280 --> 13:20.200
So then you have to ask, well, what else has Alex Jones said that has turned out

13:20.200 --> 13:24.760
to be true, at least partially, at least from like his own, from his own arguing

13:24.760 --> 13:27.720
position, from his own point of view, from his own definitions, what else

13:27.720 --> 13:28.920
has turned out to be correct?

13:28.960 --> 13:29.320
Okay.

13:29.640 --> 13:35.840
So build, this was back in 2015, Bill Gates is funding a birth control microchip

13:36.120 --> 13:40.360
that lasts 16 years inside of your body and can be turned on or off with a remote

13:40.360 --> 13:45.960
control now, Alex Jones has been talking about microchips in the body for like 20

13:45.960 --> 13:49.840
fucking years now to say that people aren't looking into this just seems to be

13:49.840 --> 13:53.760
ridiculous, yes, people are looking into this and the idea that you could like,

13:53.760 --> 13:55.040
this sounds pretty convenient, right?

13:55.040 --> 13:59.200
Like, Oh, what if, what if I could have a microchip and then for 16 years I can

13:59.200 --> 14:03.440
control whether or not by touching a button on my phone app, whether or not I

14:03.440 --> 14:06.720
can get a girl pregnant, that sounds pretty cool, but then you think about it.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.480
Well, what if it's not you who has the app, but it's the government.

14:10.680 --> 14:14.280
What if you suddenly the government is suddenly these chips are going into

14:14.280 --> 14:17.440
everybody all the time and the government controls your fertility.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.120
That doesn't sound very good either.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.400
So like, yes, there's a convenience argument.

14:23.400 --> 14:27.400
And then there's the, well, what if the Republicans come into power and make

14:27.400 --> 14:32.000
everyone have kids or what if some crazy fucking progressive comes into power and

14:32.000 --> 14:37.680
makes everyone sterile either way, like it should not be some central authorities

14:37.800 --> 14:40.040
position whether or not you should have kids, period.

14:40.360 --> 14:40.680
All right.

14:41.160 --> 14:47.120
So, yes, that's just say that this technology has the real possibility of

14:47.120 --> 14:49.440
getting used for evil and lots of it.

14:49.720 --> 14:50.600
Yes, yes.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.260
So this side, people are like Alex Jones has ranked about microchips and Bill

14:54.300 --> 14:58.180
Gates, but you know what, some of it seems to be at least partially, partially true.

14:58.540 --> 15:03.020
You know, this, this one was kind of goofy where the Australian health chief actually

15:03.020 --> 15:05.460
used the phrase new world order in a speech.

15:05.460 --> 15:06.460
I watched this video.

15:06.860 --> 15:12.740
Um, but basically she says, we will be looking at what contract, we will be

15:12.740 --> 15:16.500
looking at what contract tracing looks like in the new world order.

15:16.740 --> 15:20.740
Yes, it will be pubs and clubs and other things if we have a positive case there,

15:20.940 --> 15:23.700
but our response may be different if we know people are fully vaccinated.

15:23.940 --> 15:27.900
So this is talking about COVID, COVID contact tracing, obviously, but she uses

15:27.900 --> 15:32.340
the phrase new world order, a really dumb fucking phrase to use and the entire

15:32.340 --> 15:33.620
internet lost their mind about it.

15:33.860 --> 15:35.460
So this is probably more of a case of...

15:35.820 --> 15:40.900
You think, you think, you think that these, these government officials would

15:41.300 --> 15:43.140
avoid using those triggering terms.

15:43.220 --> 15:43.740
Yes.

15:43.860 --> 15:44.260
Yes.

15:44.580 --> 15:47.260
And this, this is probably just like a really dumb fuck mistake and not

15:47.260 --> 15:50.180
actually indicative of anything, but you know what it's...

15:50.180 --> 15:53.180
It's like Trudell saying, oh, we're going to have the great reset.

15:53.340 --> 15:54.260
Yes, yes.

15:54.460 --> 15:57.420
Or you have like Klaus Schwab saying that he's injected people into the

15:57.420 --> 16:02.660
cabinets of various, various, uh, various countries, you know, like shit like this

16:02.660 --> 16:06.580
where it's like, it's possible that you guys are absolutely fucking evil or it's

16:06.580 --> 16:08.380
possible you're really fucking dumb.

16:08.580 --> 16:09.660
Like it's, it's possible.

16:09.700 --> 16:10.220
Who knows?

16:10.380 --> 16:10.700
You know?

16:10.780 --> 16:14.260
Or they just might be so evil and they're like blatant about it.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.100
Yes, that too.

16:15.100 --> 16:15.380
That too.

16:15.380 --> 16:15.540
Right.

16:15.540 --> 16:16.300
You don't know.

16:16.660 --> 16:17.420
So yeah.

16:17.860 --> 16:21.020
Or they could just be like idiots, like you said.

16:21.380 --> 16:25.260
Alex Jones has talked about semi comedically, like always ranting and

16:25.260 --> 16:29.540
raving about how the, the 1%, you know, the globalists are sucking the blood of

16:29.540 --> 16:33.620
young people to stay alive and then you have this shit happened in 2020.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.820
Could young blood stop us from getting old?

16:36.580 --> 16:40.020
And then you have like, you have like rich people who are like getting blood

16:40.020 --> 16:41.380
infusions from young people.

16:41.860 --> 16:42.900
They remember seeing that shit?

16:43.100 --> 16:44.020
Like it's crazy.

16:44.380 --> 16:44.940
Okay.

16:44.940 --> 16:49.180
But what if, what if we could create young blood without harm?

16:50.180 --> 16:51.420
And what if that worked?

16:51.900 --> 16:52.460
I mean, I don't know.

16:52.580 --> 16:52.940
I don't know.

16:53.140 --> 16:56.260
Maybe, but still though, like we're not at that point yet.

16:56.660 --> 17:00.500
And so, you know, should old people be getting, just like paying

17:00.500 --> 17:02.060
for young blood transfusions?

17:02.060 --> 17:02.900
I don't know about that.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.420
That seems kind of ridiculous to me.

17:05.060 --> 17:07.100
What if the young people get rich from doing that?

17:07.260 --> 17:09.500
That's, that'd be a way of redistributing the wealth.

17:10.180 --> 17:10.740
I mean, that's true.

17:10.860 --> 17:11.260
That's true.

17:11.260 --> 17:11.460
Right.

17:11.860 --> 17:16.980
The, the, the issue there though, like the, the capitalist, the capitalist

17:16.980 --> 17:18.700
in me says, yes, obviously, right.

17:18.740 --> 17:19.020
Right.

17:19.300 --> 17:22.060
But then, then you have like, like the argument against it seems to be more

17:22.060 --> 17:24.740
of a lefty argument where it's like, even if they consent, it's still kind of

17:24.740 --> 17:28.740
exploitative, but yes, this is a case of Alex Jones was probably right.

17:29.820 --> 17:30.900
No, he was right.

17:30.940 --> 17:31.220
Yes.

17:31.220 --> 17:32.300
It's another Alex Jones was right.

17:32.540 --> 17:34.300
If there's some, if there's some.

17:34.700 --> 17:35.700
Backings towards it.

17:35.860 --> 17:37.820
It's probably, yep.

17:39.020 --> 17:45.660
So also, but then again, then again, that, that, uh, old people have a young blood.

17:45.660 --> 17:47.540
That was in Simpsons too, wasn't it?

17:47.780 --> 17:48.180
Oh yeah.

17:48.220 --> 17:48.460
Yeah.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.620
This is a lot of this stuff is, has been floating around the comedy

17:51.620 --> 17:52.940
sphere before it turned out to be real.

17:53.420 --> 17:57.380
Um, Alex Jones's most famous quote is turning the frogs gay.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.700
The chemicals are put in the waters, turn the frogs gay.

18:00.140 --> 18:03.580
And then it turned out this came out male frogs may be turning into female.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.580
Thanks to estrogen in suburban waste.

18:05.980 --> 18:11.380
It, the frogs gay thing is at least the femboy fucking frogs.

18:11.740 --> 18:13.580
Femboy Pepe's are out there guys.

18:13.660 --> 18:18.300
So basically estrogen waste.

18:19.020 --> 18:23.420
So, so the, the idea seems to be that, um, certain foods have a lot more estrogen in it.

18:23.820 --> 18:26.260
Uh, women who take birth control, they piss out estrogen.

18:26.700 --> 18:31.980
Um, so there's a lot more estrogen in the water supply right now.

18:32.260 --> 18:35.740
And that might be leading to certain feminization of things like male, male

18:35.740 --> 18:39.300
sperm counts are down, there's some hypothesis that that might be part of it.

18:39.300 --> 18:39.900
We don't know yet.

18:39.900 --> 18:42.220
Um, it's possible, it's not a conspiracy theory.

18:42.220 --> 18:46.060
It's possible, but the frogs gay thing seems to be related to the amount

18:46.060 --> 18:48.380
of human estrogen waste in the water.

18:48.620 --> 18:49.220
So like,

18:51.380 --> 18:55.380
it's very meme-y, but there is some truth to it.

18:55.420 --> 18:55.780
Yes.

18:55.780 --> 18:57.580
There's some, there's some truth to it, you know,

18:57.660 --> 19:01.580
another, another dollar into the Alex Jones was right.

19:04.580 --> 19:07.900
Regarding, regarding more implants, Pentagon has developed an implant

19:07.900 --> 19:11.020
that can detect COVID that they put underneath your skin.

19:11.340 --> 19:13.900
This came out last April, April, 2021.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.380
So they've built a micro sensor that goes underneath your skin that

19:18.380 --> 19:20.340
can detect your, your health situation.

19:20.740 --> 19:24.060
They used it so that they invented it so that soldiers can be, have their

19:24.060 --> 19:25.780
health monitor during, during a mission.

19:26.340 --> 19:29.260
Um, which I could see how there'd be utility in that if you're, if you're a

19:29.260 --> 19:33.740
soldier, but like, it's a pretty cool technology if it works, it's just, it's

19:33.740 --> 19:37.820
just, it's just like, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's

19:38.820 --> 19:41.900
the obvious question is what if it becomes mandatory?

19:42.060 --> 19:42.460
Yes.

19:42.460 --> 19:45.580
And also what if it becomes used on civilians and what if it becomes used

19:45.580 --> 19:49.580
for more than just health and like, there's so many, like basically Alex

19:49.580 --> 19:53.540
Jones talking about microchips and we are, we do seem to be heading slowly in

19:53.540 --> 19:54.140
that direction.

19:54.740 --> 19:56.300
Um, what else do we have?

19:56.340 --> 19:56.660
Oh yeah.

19:56.660 --> 20:02.580
So the WHO has published a guidance document for countries and implementing

20:02.580 --> 20:06.380
partners on the introduction of digital vaccine certificates.

20:06.460 --> 20:09.300
And the work was funded by, by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

20:09.300 --> 20:10.460
and the Rockefeller Foundation.

20:10.860 --> 20:15.900
So this came out of the WHO's website, digital documentation of COVID-19

20:15.900 --> 20:17.900
certificates, vaccination status.

20:18.060 --> 20:23.780
So back when COVID started, all of the conspiracy theorists, including Alex

20:23.780 --> 20:27.420
Jones said they will never make vaccines mandatory, that was a lie.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.100
They will never have vaccine passports, that was a lie.

20:30.380 --> 20:35.060
They'll never push for digital ID and digital vaccine certificates.

20:35.060 --> 20:35.700
That was a lie.

20:36.100 --> 20:40.660
They'll never make you scan your phone going into a business to make, to ensure

20:40.660 --> 20:44.500
that you had your vaccine, they'll never actually make you verify it constantly.

20:44.820 --> 20:45.500
That was a lie.

20:45.540 --> 20:46.580
They'll never restrict movement.

20:46.580 --> 20:47.100
That was a lie.

20:47.460 --> 20:54.060
Like so many things, they just, people, again, mostly leftists, people, when

20:54.060 --> 20:57.060
COVID first hit, they're like, we'll never do this.

20:57.260 --> 20:58.700
You're crazy for assuming it.

20:58.700 --> 20:59.900
You're crazy for predicting it.

21:00.100 --> 21:04.100
Even like, even like leftist YouTubers and stuff said that it was, it was right.

21:04.140 --> 21:06.940
Misinformation and disinformation and conspiracy theories.

21:06.940 --> 21:08.340
And these people are crazy.

21:08.340 --> 21:10.060
They're, they're undermining public trust.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.020
They need to be deplatformed fucking everything.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.340
And it all came true.

21:15.860 --> 21:17.540
It all came fucking true.

21:19.540 --> 21:22.540
And I don't like being the guy who has to sit here and say that it came true,

21:22.540 --> 21:23.700
but it came fucking true.

21:24.700 --> 21:30.540
I've heard people say that, uh, COVID like passports was never going to be a thing.

21:30.700 --> 21:32.260
And then it became a thing.

21:32.580 --> 21:34.020
And then it became a thing.

21:34.740 --> 21:40.300
Like we're not, we're not, we're not anti COVID or anti-vaxxers here.

21:40.540 --> 21:44.700
It's not even that big of a deal personally, I think, unless, unless

21:44.700 --> 21:46.300
they're like micro-tripping people.

21:46.300 --> 21:51.300
It's just like a piece of paper that says, that says like, I, I got, I got a shot.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.300
That's, that's fine.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.460
They should have never denied it is what I'm saying.

21:54.540 --> 21:54.860
Yeah.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.340
Well, here's the issue now.

21:56.380 --> 21:58.420
Never said, Oh, you're, you're crazy.

21:59.380 --> 22:03.060
The issue now seems to be now that they've gone back in so many things and they've

22:03.060 --> 22:04.780
tried to rewrite history so many times.

22:05.060 --> 22:07.340
Now they're saying we will never microchip you.

22:07.580 --> 22:11.860
So everyone is like hyper on edge and they're like, we know what's going on here.

22:12.020 --> 22:16.140
We've seen the song and dance that has played out since, since early 2020.

22:16.380 --> 22:16.900
You know what I mean?

22:16.900 --> 22:20.260
Like everyone is now being like, I know, no, we know what's coming now.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.900
You're saying that we're not going to do this.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.340
Let's see what happens in a few years.

22:23.340 --> 22:24.300
That's what everyone's saying now.

22:25.380 --> 22:25.980
Yeah.

22:26.580 --> 22:32.540
Um, and then finally the, the biggest, the biggest conspiracy of all the, the girls

22:32.540 --> 22:38.860
were just so young, the horrors of Jeffrey Epstein's private Island, Alex Jones, Alex

22:38.860 --> 22:44.780
Jones has been talking about the pedophiles in Hollywood and in the news and in the

22:44.780 --> 22:48.140
ruling class for anybody.

22:48.420 --> 22:51.460
And it was always just crazy conspiracy theories.

22:51.860 --> 22:55.940
And then like the Epstein Island thing was, was probably the most blatant example

22:55.940 --> 22:57.460
of it, where it happened.

22:57.700 --> 23:01.580
We all know that it happened and everyone has agreed just not to talk about it.

23:01.900 --> 23:02.540
You know what I mean?

23:03.660 --> 23:05.140
Everyone has agreed not to look into it.

23:05.460 --> 23:10.860
Every everyone has basically said, no, he clearly, he clearly hung himself, shut the

23:10.860 --> 23:11.300
fuck up.

23:11.340 --> 23:15.260
And like, everyone knows, everyone knows what, that it's a fiction.

23:15.420 --> 23:17.620
Don't question it, don't look into it.

23:18.620 --> 23:24.620
So this great meme was sent to me by, um, by Charles Kahn.

23:25.260 --> 23:29.220
So how should you talk to friends and relatives who believe conspiracy theories?

23:29.500 --> 23:32.020
Here's what you say, Hey bro, you were right about everything.

23:32.020 --> 23:32.580
I'm sorry.

23:33.980 --> 23:37.580
That's, that's how you fucking deal with someone like Alex Jones.

23:38.620 --> 23:40.060
You just, you just admit it.

23:40.140 --> 23:42.220
I guess, I guess that's the case.

23:42.820 --> 23:43.420
Oh no.

23:43.980 --> 23:47.900
Yeah, it's, it's, it's funny how hard our world works.

23:47.980 --> 23:48.300
Yeah.

23:48.860 --> 23:52.220
What seems to have happened though, my actual honest take on Alex Jones seems to

23:52.220 --> 23:57.100
be something more like Alex Jones is kind of like Nostradamus, where he made a

23:57.100 --> 23:58.100
billion predictions.

23:58.740 --> 24:02.660
Most of them are wrong, but the ones are bound to be right.

24:02.700 --> 24:02.860
Yeah.

24:02.860 --> 24:03.860
Some of them are bound to be right.

24:03.860 --> 24:06.060
And the ones that were right are like really high profile.

24:06.580 --> 24:06.980
Yes.

24:06.980 --> 24:07.980
They were really high profile.

24:09.220 --> 24:13.460
The wrong side, the ones that he were, that he was wrong with was high profile

24:13.460 --> 24:16.340
too, tiny hook shit that ruined him.

24:16.500 --> 24:17.660
Yeah, that's true enough.

24:17.660 --> 24:17.860
Yeah.

24:18.860 --> 24:22.340
He also had some high profile hits, like the whole Epstein shit.

24:22.700 --> 24:22.980
Yep.

24:23.620 --> 24:30.140
Like I was talking about it, like after hearing about it, I probably didn't even

24:30.140 --> 24:36.300
know he was the one who said it at first, but like, uh, I was, I was talking about

24:36.300 --> 24:45.060
it back in my fucking 2017 or some shit earlier on, and it was like, I had, it

24:45.140 --> 24:48.820
is just like, like these horrible things that these rich people are doing.

24:48.820 --> 24:52.100
And it's just like, I get looked at and it's just like, I'm looking at,

24:52.100 --> 24:53.540
looked at a lot of like, I'm crazy.

24:53.660 --> 24:59.140
Like I'm like, this must be pre QAnon, but like if QAnon existed, I would

24:59.140 --> 25:00.660
have probably got called bad too.

25:02.140 --> 25:02.460
Yeah.

25:02.500 --> 25:02.620
Yeah.

25:02.620 --> 25:03.180
I know what you mean.

25:03.740 --> 25:10.060
And the worst part is, is like the people who still call him just a conspiracy

25:10.060 --> 25:14.820
theorist, they kind of it's like, what the fuck, like, what the fuck are you doing?

25:14.820 --> 25:15.900
He is a character.

25:15.900 --> 25:21.300
He's a, he is a conspiracy theorist, but he's also more than that, I think.

25:21.620 --> 25:21.980
Yeah.

25:22.100 --> 25:22.420
Yeah.

25:23.100 --> 25:27.260
And, but you see people, so, so when it comes to the mainstream media, they're

25:27.260 --> 25:29.300
protecting, they're, they are protecting their own interests.

25:29.300 --> 25:31.380
They're going to say, Oh, obviously he's a conspiracy theorist.

25:31.380 --> 25:35.460
You guys, but like, then you see, you see like some YouTubers though.

25:35.580 --> 25:37.580
They like, you got like, YouTubers should know better at this point.

25:37.580 --> 25:39.020
We're, we're more on the ground.

25:39.180 --> 25:40.420
We're more like regular people.

25:40.420 --> 25:43.060
We're, we kind of, we're kind of closer to things like you should know better.

25:43.060 --> 25:45.300
We don't purport to be the arbiters of truth.

25:45.540 --> 25:45.780
Yeah.

25:45.780 --> 25:54.500
We're learning just like you, but it's why we, it's like, we're not the same as

25:54.500 --> 25:59.860
like, like those big media profiles where it's just like, they have an entire team.

26:00.260 --> 26:00.580
Yeah.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.100
Where it's just like.

26:03.060 --> 26:06.940
But also more importantly though, we don't have the same interest that they do

26:06.940 --> 26:10.660
because they're, they're, they're, we don't have the same, we don't have the

26:10.660 --> 26:11.900
people paying us.

26:12.180 --> 26:12.460
Yeah.

26:13.260 --> 26:17.420
It was just like, to tell us what to say and that type of shit.

26:17.980 --> 26:18.260
Yeah.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.140
Real Holzner for $5.

26:20.140 --> 26:20.540
Thank you.

26:21.060 --> 26:24.180
Alex Jones was right in the same way that you're bound to hit your target.

26:24.180 --> 26:27.780
If you aim in the right general direction and are close up with a shotgun.

26:27.860 --> 26:29.380
We're more on the ground is what I mean.

26:29.660 --> 26:30.100
Yes.

26:30.180 --> 26:30.500
Yes.

26:30.580 --> 26:31.940
More on the ground in some ways.

26:31.940 --> 26:32.140
Yeah.

26:32.500 --> 26:35.980
But also like we're, we're less ideologically possessed.

26:35.980 --> 26:38.820
Let's say, you know, like I'm not interested in.

26:38.860 --> 26:45.340
We have our own personal biases, but we, we try to like, we don't have like people

26:45.340 --> 26:47.700
telling us like, this is what you need to believe.

26:48.580 --> 26:49.900
Yes, yes, exactly.

26:50.260 --> 26:55.900
So like you have, you might have like a right wing pundit who are like, Alex

26:55.900 --> 26:57.340
Jones is never wrong based.

26:57.340 --> 26:58.340
He freaked out everything.

26:58.340 --> 26:59.940
He knows, he knows what's going on.

26:59.940 --> 27:02.220
Legitimately believe Alex Jones is like, chill the fuck out.

27:02.220 --> 27:02.500
All right.

27:02.740 --> 27:05.820
Then you also have like, like a left wing, like lefty tuber, like a

27:05.820 --> 27:06.780
bread tuber or something.

27:06.940 --> 27:10.060
And they might say something like, if you believe in anything that Alex

27:10.060 --> 27:12.940
Jones says, you're a conspiracy theorist, Nazi, you're part of the problem.

27:12.940 --> 27:13.660
You're radicalizing.

27:13.660 --> 27:16.260
But it's like, both of you guys need to chill the fuck out.

27:16.300 --> 27:16.580
All right.

27:16.580 --> 27:18.540
Like just, just, just calm down.

27:18.900 --> 27:23.300
It admitting that Alex Jones was right about some very bad things

27:23.300 --> 27:24.820
does not make you a bad person.

27:24.820 --> 27:26.420
It does not make you a conspiracy theorist.

27:27.020 --> 27:32.820
It doesn't, it, you know, God, the truth is the truth regardless of

27:33.540 --> 27:35.540
the political inconvenience of it.

27:35.940 --> 27:39.340
The question is, has Alex Jones been more or less correct than

27:39.340 --> 27:40.620
the general news companies?

27:41.700 --> 27:45.220
I get that he looks more unhinged, but is he less correct than they were?

27:45.460 --> 27:46.220
I actually don't know.

27:46.340 --> 27:47.820
I think, I think what's actually going on.

27:48.180 --> 27:53.540
I think what's actually going on here is that Alex Jones is, has been

27:53.580 --> 27:58.700
more correct about things that the mainstream establishment has

27:58.700 --> 28:01.020
been like vehemently denying.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.020
It's like that never happened.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.100
You can't say that happened.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.500
You can't talk about like those kinds of topics.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.580
Alex Jones has been correct about that.

28:07.580 --> 28:10.420
And I think that's, that's important because if there was no stakes to

28:10.420 --> 28:14.620
any of these stories and Alex Jones just said some wild shit, most

28:14.620 --> 28:15.540
people would just ignore it.

28:18.060 --> 28:21.940
Yeah, I think that's what seems, I think that's, what's going on here

28:21.940 --> 28:24.580
is that where he's, where he's correct.

28:24.620 --> 28:26.460
It seems to be kind of a big deal.
