1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
We cannot prove that we cannot prove at all that there is some kind of political

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,020
motivation or some kind of concerted effort to, uh, to take down Alex Jones,

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,580
but we can be conspiracy theorists ourselves.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,220
We can stay up until 3 AM with like coffee and cigarettes and pinning things

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,220
together on a board with tax and string like pictures.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,700
And we can do that too.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,380
We can be that crazy guy too.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,260
So maybe we should indulge a little bit.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:26,720
Okay.

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,140
So this is an article from December of 2020.

11
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,620
This is mostly regarding COVID stuff.

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,880
How should you talk to your friends and relatives who

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,280
believe in conspiracy theory?

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,140
There is, this is like a lifestyle article.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,280
This is not a serious news piece.

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,320
It's a fluff piece, but let's just, let's check it out.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:44,640
Okay.

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,680
You're dreading the moment as your uncle passes the roast potatoes.

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,920
He casually mentions that a coronavirus vaccine will be used to inject

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,080
microchips into our bodies to track us.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,680
Or maybe it's the point when a friend after a couple of pints starts talking

22
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,220
about how COVID-19 doesn't exist or when, or when pudding is ruined as a long lost

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,440
cousin starts spinning lurid tales about QAnon and elite Satanists eating babies.

24
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,500
Oh my God.

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,860
So I think I recall this.

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,140
It was like 2018 or 2019 Lilith, and you posted a tweet that

27
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,560
inspired a video of mine.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,540
And the tweet was, it was a trans person waving the, the, the, the, the

29
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,680
trans flag, and then having a turkey shoved on their hand in the other hand.

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,260
You remember that?

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,240
I don't remember that.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,840
What was that?

33
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,300
Okay.

34
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:39,720
Hold on.

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,560
They have a turkey?

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,160
Okay.

37
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,960
So I can't find it.

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,280
Shit.

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,620
I did a video and the thumbnail of the video, there's a trans person with like

40
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,460
brown skin and short purple hair, and they're screeching and they're waving

41
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,980
a trans flag and they have a turkey shoved on their fist in the asshole of

42
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,740
the turkey on the other one.

43
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,860
And it was supposed to be like a trans Thanksgiving thing.

44
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,940
There was that picture.

45
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,460
And you posted that it was a drawing.

46
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,000
It was a drawing.

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,420
And someone took that.

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,680
No, you took that picture post on your Twitter and you said, this is what these

49
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,200
crazies want you to think trans people are, but we're not this, we're not this

50
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,800
fucking crazy.

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,120
I don't remember saying, I, I, sorry.

52
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,520
I, I, it was like four years ago, were you remembering somebody else?

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,760
Oh, no, it was, it was definitely you.

54
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,520
I'm trying, I'm trying to remember the turkey.

55
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,320
It was a cooked turkey.

56
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,960
It was a cooked turkey.

57
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,360
I don't, there's nothing like that in my mind, but you might be right.

58
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,440
Okay.

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,600
Can I, maybe if like I find a picture you'll know, Hey chat, can you guys

60
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,560
like find that video?

61
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,840
Oh, that one.

62
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,240
Yeah.

63
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,880
So you, you definitely took this and posted it on your Twitter back in the day.

64
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:02,280
And you were like, yeah, that's such a, but it's such a, okay.

65
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,960
So then the dream, why I feel like you've mentioned it.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,720
I was, I thought it was like, was this a fever dream?

67
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,880
What the hell?

68
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,720
So this, this image, it looks like it's a meme.

69
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,320
It's a fucking joke, but it was used on ironically, it was used on ironically in

70
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,240
like a pro trans Thanksgiving article where it's like how to confront your racist

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,120
conservative uncle at Thanksgiving, how to shoot them down and it's like, chill

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,400
the fuck out guys, like Jesus.

73
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:40,080
Yeah, it was, it was used like, like why do you make, that's how you portray trans

74
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,160
people, a crazy pink haired person.

75
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,960
I mean, I'm sure some are.

76
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Fisting a turkey for fuck's sake.

77
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Fisting a turkey.

78
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,400
So why, why, why are they fisting a turkey because their, uh, relatives

79
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,880
drove them so crazy, I guess, but why?

80
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,600
So I'm bringing that up because this article kind of plays off of that, you

81
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,520
know, like how do you deal with crazies, crazies at the dinner table during

82
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,360
holidays, you know, the uncle you only see once a year or whatever.

83
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:20,120
Now, rather than this being about like LGBT stuff, this is about conspiracy

84
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,640
theories.

85
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,680
How do you deal with your uncle who thinks that a coronavirus vaccine will

86
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,560
inject microchips into your bodies or talking about how COVID doesn't exist or

87
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,400
QAnon or elite Satanists.

88
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,120
Now, first of all, the left itself, they're also, they're also, uh, very in

89
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,280
on the conspiracy theories.

90
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,200
They talk about the globalist bourgeoisie 1%, you know, they, they talk about Bill

91
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,560
Gates just as much like that's, it's not fucking pretend that there's not, this

92
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,520
isn't like a, like a bipartisan thing.

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,360
It certainly is.

94
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:48,960
All right.

95
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,440
But still, how do you talk about conspiracy theories, ruining your,

96
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,920
your family get together?

97
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,400
Okay.

98
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,360
So this, this article gives you like, it's a keep calm, don't be dismissive,

99
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,520
encourage critical thinking, ask questions, don't expect immediate results.

100
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,040
So soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy.

102
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,000
So let's actually go, what you do is you play into it.

103
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,640
Yeah.

104
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,360
So you play into it.

105
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,880
You, you, you go, you go even crazier.

106
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,800
You go even crazier than, than your, than your relatives.

107
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,600
You go, if they think, if they think like a fucking, if they think that

108
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,480
nine 11 steel beams and shit, you just, just say the tower didn't even exist.

109
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,720
The tower never existed.

110
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,080
Tower.

111
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,520
It never existed.

112
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,320
I mean, has there been proof?

113
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,600
Has anybody, has anybody seen the towers for 20 years?

114
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,840
They vanished.

115
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,640
Okay.

116
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:58,320
So with Alex Jones being the primary conspiracy theorist peddler, we should

117
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,880
look into some of these conspiracy theories.

118
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,080
Okay.

119
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,120
So for example, this was a good one.

120
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,600
This was like, this is a surface level Alex Jonesery.

121
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,080
Okay.

122
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,440
Remember when Alex Jones said that whenever Silicon Valley gets called

123
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,640
out on their shit, they just throw some Indian out in front to act confused

124
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,320
and say that they don't think they're doing anything wrong.

125
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,360
And that is exactly what Twitter did on the, on the Joe Rogan show a few years

126
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,400
ago, where, uh, Jack showed up with, with this, this Indian woman who was like,

127
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,760
we're, I don't know what you mean.

128
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,640
We're, we're doing okay.

129
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,600
Aren't we like, I don't understand, you know, like that was the meme, you

130
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,400
know, three or four years ago, let's check this one out.

131
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,600
This is from 2019.

132
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:35,880
Okay.

133
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,520
So about three years ago, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan war leads

134
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,200
to conspiracy theory meltdown.

135
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,360
Infowars host says that babies are being harvested for their organs.

136
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,040
It seems pretty crazy, right?

138
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,120
It seems pretty fucking crazy.

139
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,640
Yeah.

140
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,680
Sounds like sounds like Alex Jones, but then, but then.

141
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,760
But then hold on.

142
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,000
So after a recent feud, Jones has invited back on Joe Rogan's show while

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,360
speaking with martial arts instructor Eddie Bravo, an episode uploaded on

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,200
Wednesday, Jones began shouting about infanticide, I came here and I proved

145
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,320
they're keeping babies alive and they're taking their organs, the Senate voted

146
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,000
Monday to keep it legal, they fucking did it Bravo, and you can't fucking admit

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,120
they're, they're killing already born kids, so you're telling me it isn't real

148
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,960
when they had a fucking vote in the God, in the goddamn fucking Senate, that's

149
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,000
the conspiracy theory that Bravo responds, I am ready to beat your fucking ass.

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,680
Jones answers.

151
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,720
You think you're fucking tough.

152
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,360
You're about to get it.

153
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,920
Bullshit.

154
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,320
They're killing already born babies.

155
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,400
Stop fucking lying.

156
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,000
God fucking damn it.

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,680
I'm getting pissed.

158
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,920
So Jones is going off.

159
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,600
Jones is fucking got a hinge at this point.

160
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
I'll beat your fucking ass.

161
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,240
He's fucking crazy.

162
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,360
Um, when, when contact for comment and info wars representative sent

163
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,640
Newsweek articles about late term abortion, including a slate report

164
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,360
dating to 2012, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume

165
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,320
that you're simply ignorant and not malicious, mentally challenged.

166
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,760
Okay.

167
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,200
So Alex Jones is ranting.

168
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,160
This is back in 2019, clear conspiracy theorist.

169
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,160
And this is going to be used to, uh, restrict, restrict abortion

170
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
rights and all this shit.

171
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,080
It's going to make people, you can already see the narrative unfold.

172
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,480
This is what a leftoid would say is that Alex Jones need to be

173
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,440
censors because he's going to make things worse for women.

174
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:14,960
Okay.

175
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,600
Well, what actually, what came out recently.

176
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,720
So this came out, this came out, um, about a year ago, two

177
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,120
years after this rant happened, federal government caught buying

178
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,600
fresh flesh of aborted babies who could have survived as preemies.

179
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,520
So the U S government has been buying and trafficking

180
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,400
fresh aborted baby body parts.

181
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,360
Now, if you, if you believe that if he is as a baby, then the whole,

182
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,760
they're killing babies for their body parts, that language makes sense here.

183
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,840
So, um, these body parts purchased by the U S food and drug administration

184
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,960
to humanize mice and test biologic drugs in scientific experiments came

185
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,040
from babies up to 24 weeks old in gestation, just weeks from being born.

186
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,400
Uh, okay.

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,280
That's kind of crazy.

188
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,560
So records indicate that ABR waste not want not.

189
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,240
Waste not want not.

190
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,480
So they were going to get aborted anyways.

191
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,720
Yeah.

192
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:25,640
Um, so the company, so there's a company called ABR that makes millions.

193
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,800
This company makes millions every year by harvesting organs, like lungs,

194
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,440
livers, eyeballs, and brains from aborted babies and reselling them at profit.

195
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,600
ABR was paid $12,000 upfront per per box of babies.

196
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,080
Some of them were survivable outside of the womb.

197
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,120
Between the gestational age of 16 to 24 weeks, most purchases are

198
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,640
for intact thymuses and livers.

199
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,480
Yeah.

200
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,560
Intact thymuses and liver and livers shipped fresh and on wet ice.

201
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,600
The FDA doctor with the callousness of picking a cut of meat from a butcher

202
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,600
shop, an FDA doctor request tissue samples be procured from a baby boy.

203
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,360
As they claim, it is strongly preferred to have a male fetus if at all possible,

204
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,440
but undetermined sex or female is better than no tissue.

205
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,520
Okay.

206
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,680
So there's, there's, there's this stuff.

207
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,960
Now this, this is from the Federalist and the Federalist has,

208
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,440
has a right wing slant for sure.

209
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,040
So maybe, you know, maybe this is just like, who knows, right?

210
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,760
So we can keep going.

211
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,920
Here's Fox.

212
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,920
Fox is a more mainstream right-wing source, and this is six months later.

213
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,320
Um, six months after this previous report, millions in federal money

214
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,240
flowed to a tissue bank that collected fetal heart gonads, gonads, legs, and brain.

215
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,880
And this, this report came from the university university of Pittsburgh.

216
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,360
Yeah.

217
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,480
So the university of Pittsburgh, the department of health and human services

218
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,120
has funneled at least $2.7 million into a university of Pittsburgh project

219
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,320
that utilizes a tissue bank with Oregon's.

220
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:58,880
Okay.

221
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,720
So there's like, there's multiple organizations doing this

222
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,640
sort of thing right now.

223
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,040
Okay.

224
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,400
Um, I mean, yeah, it's, it's pretty, it's pretty oof.

225
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:18,520
Um, so Trump, Trump put a ban on it in 2019.

226
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,560
He banned it.

227
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,680
And this came out of the national library of medicine.

228
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,480
It was just basically a paper signed by some researchers who were

229
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,440
saying that we should not ban it.

230
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,520
And they were saying like this, this tissue is being aborted anyway.

231
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,640
Abortion is still legal in the United States.

232
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,320
And so as long as it's being aborted anyway, this tissue actually

233
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,800
is useful in medical experiments.

234
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,200
There have been good things to come out of it because there's

235
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,800
various medicines and studies and, and, and, and, and whatever the case

236
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,720
may be new data has come out of that has been come out of examining this stuff.

237
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,880
So we shouldn't be stopping it for a moral reason like that, because

238
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
they're getting aborted anyway.

239
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,040
And that was their point of view at the, um, at the national library for medicine.

240
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,400
So they, they wrote this paper saying here, we, the undersigned believe

241
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,880
that we should be able to use this, this tissue to solve these problems.

242
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,760
And they mentioned some HIV research that mentioned some other research.

243
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,640
So it's like, okay, fair enough.

244
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,960
Like there is obviously a benefit here.

245
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:20,760
Um, and then this happened April, 2021 Biden's national Institute of Health

246
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,680
has officially rescinded the ban on using fetal tissues and research on Friday.

247
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,640
So Trump banned it in 2019, Biden unbanned it in 2021.

248
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,280
So there's probably going to be a partisan going back and forth on the use of

249
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
these, these body parts for some time.

250
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:42,000
But the point being is that everyone was calling Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist

251
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,360
back when he yelled and screeched this on the Joe Rogan show, but it turned

252
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,440
out to be at least kind of correct.

253
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,480
And that's the important part is that like, like you, you can, you can move

254
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,400
the goalposts and say, okay, it's true, but we just think it's good.

255
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,480
That's it, but yeah, exactly.

256
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,360
So like the, the, we do it and it's good conversation is a different conversation

257
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,880
than the, we don't do it conversation.

258
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,720
So they were saying, we don't do this.

259
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,480
It's so crazy.

260
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,400
Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist, but it turns out he was

261
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,280
kind of right in that one.

262
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,040
All right.

263
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,200
So then you have to ask, well, what else has Alex Jones said that has turned out

264
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,760
to be true, at least partially, at least from like his own, from his own arguing

265
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,720
position, from his own point of view, from his own definitions, what else

266
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,920
has turned out to be correct?

267
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,320
Okay.

268
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:35,840
So build, this was back in 2015, Bill Gates is funding a birth control microchip

269
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,360
that lasts 16 years inside of your body and can be turned on or off with a remote

270
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,960
control now, Alex Jones has been talking about microchips in the body for like 20

271
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,840
fucking years now to say that people aren't looking into this just seems to be

272
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,760
ridiculous, yes, people are looking into this and the idea that you could like,

273
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,040
this sounds pretty convenient, right?

274
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,200
Like, Oh, what if, what if I could have a microchip and then for 16 years I can

275
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,440
control whether or not by touching a button on my phone app, whether or not I

276
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,720
can get a girl pregnant, that sounds pretty cool, but then you think about it.

277
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,480
Well, what if it's not you who has the app, but it's the government.

278
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,280
What if you suddenly the government is suddenly these chips are going into

279
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,440
everybody all the time and the government controls your fertility.

280
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,120
That doesn't sound very good either.

281
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,400
So like, yes, there's a convenience argument.

282
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,400
And then there's the, well, what if the Republicans come into power and make

283
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,000
everyone have kids or what if some crazy fucking progressive comes into power and

284
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,680
makes everyone sterile either way, like it should not be some central authorities

285
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,040
position whether or not you should have kids, period.

286
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:40,680
All right.

287
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,120
So, yes, that's just say that this technology has the real possibility of

288
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,440
getting used for evil and lots of it.

289
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,600
Yes, yes.

290
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,260
So this side, people are like Alex Jones has ranked about microchips and Bill

291
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,180
Gates, but you know what, some of it seems to be at least partially, partially true.

292
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,020
You know, this, this one was kind of goofy where the Australian health chief actually

293
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,460
used the phrase new world order in a speech.

294
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,460
I watched this video.

295
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,740
Um, but basically she says, we will be looking at what contract, we will be

296
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,500
looking at what contract tracing looks like in the new world order.

297
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,740
Yes, it will be pubs and clubs and other things if we have a positive case there,

298
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,700
but our response may be different if we know people are fully vaccinated.

299
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,900
So this is talking about COVID, COVID contact tracing, obviously, but she uses

300
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,340
the phrase new world order, a really dumb fucking phrase to use and the entire

301
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,620
internet lost their mind about it.

302
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,460
So this is probably more of a case of...

303
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,900
You think, you think, you think that these, these government officials would

304
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,140
avoid using those triggering terms.

305
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,740
Yes.

306
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,260
Yes.

307
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,260
And this, this is probably just like a really dumb fuck mistake and not

308
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,180
actually indicative of anything, but you know what it's...

309
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,180
It's like Trudell saying, oh, we're going to have the great reset.

310
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,260
Yes, yes.

311
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,420
Or you have like Klaus Schwab saying that he's injected people into the

312
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,660
cabinets of various, various, uh, various countries, you know, like shit like this

313
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,580
where it's like, it's possible that you guys are absolutely fucking evil or it's

314
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,380
possible you're really fucking dumb.

315
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,660
Like it's, it's possible.

316
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,220
Who knows?

317
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,700
You know?

318
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,260
Or they just might be so evil and they're like blatant about it.

319
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,100
Yes, that too.

320
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,380
That too.

321
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,540
Right.

322
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,300
You don't know.

323
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,420
So yeah.

324
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,020
Or they could just be like idiots, like you said.

325
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,260
Alex Jones has talked about semi comedically, like always ranting and

326
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,540
raving about how the, the 1%, you know, the globalists are sucking the blood of

327
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,620
young people to stay alive and then you have this shit happened in 2020.

328
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,820
Could young blood stop us from getting old?

329
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,020
And then you have like, you have like rich people who are like getting blood

330
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,380
infusions from young people.

331
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,900
They remember seeing that shit?

332
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,020
Like it's crazy.

333
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,940
Okay.

334
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,180
But what if, what if we could create young blood without harm?

335
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,420
And what if that worked?

336
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,460
I mean, I don't know.

337
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:52,940
I don't know.

338
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,260
Maybe, but still though, like we're not at that point yet.

339
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,500
And so, you know, should old people be getting, just like paying

340
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,060
for young blood transfusions?

341
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,900
I don't know about that.

342
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,420
That seems kind of ridiculous to me.

343
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,100
What if the young people get rich from doing that?

344
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,500
That's, that'd be a way of redistributing the wealth.

345
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:10,740
I mean, that's true.

346
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,260
That's true.

347
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:11,460
Right.

348
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,980
The, the, the issue there though, like the, the capitalist, the capitalist

349
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,700
in me says, yes, obviously, right.

350
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,020
Right.

351
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,060
But then, then you have like, like the argument against it seems to be more

352
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,740
of a lefty argument where it's like, even if they consent, it's still kind of

353
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,740
exploitative, but yes, this is a case of Alex Jones was probably right.

354
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,900
No, he was right.

355
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,220
Yes.

356
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,300
It's another Alex Jones was right.

357
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,300
If there's some, if there's some.

358
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Backings towards it.

359
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,820
It's probably, yep.

360
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:45,660
So also, but then again, then again, that, that, uh, old people have a young blood.

361
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,540
That was in Simpsons too, wasn't it?

362
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,180
Oh yeah.

363
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,460
Yeah.

364
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,620
This is a lot of this stuff is, has been floating around the comedy

365
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,940
sphere before it turned out to be real.

366
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,380
Um, Alex Jones's most famous quote is turning the frogs gay.

367
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,700
The chemicals are put in the waters, turn the frogs gay.

368
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,580
And then it turned out this came out male frogs may be turning into female.

369
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,580
Thanks to estrogen in suburban waste.

370
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,380
It, the frogs gay thing is at least the femboy fucking frogs.

371
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,580
Femboy Pepe's are out there guys.

372
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,300
So basically estrogen waste.

373
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,420
So, so the, the idea seems to be that, um, certain foods have a lot more estrogen in it.

374
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,260
Uh, women who take birth control, they piss out estrogen.

375
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,980
Um, so there's a lot more estrogen in the water supply right now.

376
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,740
And that might be leading to certain feminization of things like male, male

377
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,300
sperm counts are down, there's some hypothesis that that might be part of it.

378
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,900
We don't know yet.

379
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,220
Um, it's possible, it's not a conspiracy theory.

380
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,060
It's possible, but the frogs gay thing seems to be related to the amount

381
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,380
of human estrogen waste in the water.

382
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,220
So like,

383
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,380
it's very meme-y, but there is some truth to it.

384
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:55,780
Yes.

385
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,580
There's some, there's some truth to it, you know,

386
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,580
another, another dollar into the Alex Jones was right.

387
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,900
Regarding, regarding more implants, Pentagon has developed an implant

388
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,020
that can detect COVID that they put underneath your skin.

389
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,900
This came out last April, April, 2021.

390
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,380
So they've built a micro sensor that goes underneath your skin that

391
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,340
can detect your, your health situation.

392
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,060
They used it so that they invented it so that soldiers can be, have their

393
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,780
health monitor during, during a mission.

394
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,260
Um, which I could see how there'd be utility in that if you're, if you're a

395
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,740
soldier, but like, it's a pretty cool technology if it works, it's just, it's

396
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,820
just, it's just like, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's

397
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,900
the obvious question is what if it becomes mandatory?

398
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,460
Yes.

399
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,580
And also what if it becomes used on civilians and what if it becomes used

400
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,580
for more than just health and like, there's so many, like basically Alex

401
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,540
Jones talking about microchips and we are, we do seem to be heading slowly in

402
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,140
that direction.

403
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,300
Um, what else do we have?

404
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:56,660
Oh yeah.

405
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:02,580
So the WHO has published a guidance document for countries and implementing

406
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,380
partners on the introduction of digital vaccine certificates.

407
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,300
And the work was funded by, by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

408
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,460
and the Rockefeller Foundation.

409
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,900
So this came out of the WHO's website, digital documentation of COVID-19

410
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,900
certificates, vaccination status.

411
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,780
So back when COVID started, all of the conspiracy theorists, including Alex

412
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,420
Jones said they will never make vaccines mandatory, that was a lie.

413
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,100
They will never have vaccine passports, that was a lie.

414
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,060
They'll never push for digital ID and digital vaccine certificates.

415
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,700
That was a lie.

416
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,660
They'll never make you scan your phone going into a business to make, to ensure

417
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,500
that you had your vaccine, they'll never actually make you verify it constantly.

418
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,500
That was a lie.

419
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,580
They'll never restrict movement.

420
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,100
That was a lie.

421
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:54,060
Like so many things, they just, people, again, mostly leftists, people, when

422
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,060
COVID first hit, they're like, we'll never do this.

423
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,700
You're crazy for assuming it.

424
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,900
You're crazy for predicting it.

425
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,100
Even like, even like leftist YouTubers and stuff said that it was, it was right.

426
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,940
Misinformation and disinformation and conspiracy theories.

427
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,340
And these people are crazy.

428
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,060
They're, they're undermining public trust.

429
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,020
They need to be deplatformed fucking everything.

430
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,340
And it all came true.

431
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,540
It all came fucking true.

432
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,540
And I don't like being the guy who has to sit here and say that it came true,

433
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,700
but it came fucking true.

434
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:30,540
I've heard people say that, uh, COVID like passports was never going to be a thing.

435
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,260
And then it became a thing.

436
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,020
And then it became a thing.

437
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,300
Like we're not, we're not, we're not anti COVID or anti-vaxxers here.

438
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,700
It's not even that big of a deal personally, I think, unless, unless

439
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,300
they're like micro-tripping people.

440
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:51,300
It's just like a piece of paper that says, that says like, I, I got, I got a shot.

441
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,300
That's, that's fine.

442
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,460
They should have never denied it is what I'm saying.

443
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:54,860
Yeah.

444
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,340
Well, here's the issue now.

445
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,420
Never said, Oh, you're, you're crazy.

446
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,060
The issue now seems to be now that they've gone back in so many things and they've

447
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,780
tried to rewrite history so many times.

448
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,340
Now they're saying we will never microchip you.

449
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,860
So everyone is like hyper on edge and they're like, we know what's going on here.

450
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,140
We've seen the song and dance that has played out since, since early 2020.

451
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,900
You know what I mean?

452
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,260
Like everyone is now being like, I know, no, we know what's coming now.

453
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,900
You're saying that we're not going to do this.

454
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,340
Let's see what happens in a few years.

455
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,300
That's what everyone's saying now.

456
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:25,980
Yeah.

457
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:32,540
Um, and then finally the, the biggest, the biggest conspiracy of all the, the girls

458
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:38,860
were just so young, the horrors of Jeffrey Epstein's private Island, Alex Jones, Alex

459
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:44,780
Jones has been talking about the pedophiles in Hollywood and in the news and in the

460
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,140
ruling class for anybody.

461
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:51,460
And it was always just crazy conspiracy theories.

462
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,940
And then like the Epstein Island thing was, was probably the most blatant example

463
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,460
of it, where it happened.

464
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,580
We all know that it happened and everyone has agreed just not to talk about it.

465
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,540
You know what I mean?

466
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,140
Everyone has agreed not to look into it.

467
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,860
Every everyone has basically said, no, he clearly, he clearly hung himself, shut the

468
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,300
fuck up.

469
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,260
And like, everyone knows, everyone knows what, that it's a fiction.

470
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,620
Don't question it, don't look into it.

471
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:24,620
So this great meme was sent to me by, um, by Charles Kahn.

472
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,220
So how should you talk to friends and relatives who believe conspiracy theories?

473
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,020
Here's what you say, Hey bro, you were right about everything.

474
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,580
I'm sorry.

475
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,580
That's, that's how you fucking deal with someone like Alex Jones.

476
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,060
You just, you just admit it.

477
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,220
I guess, I guess that's the case.

478
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,420
Oh no.

479
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,900
Yeah, it's, it's, it's funny how hard our world works.

480
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,300
Yeah.

481
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,220
What seems to have happened though, my actual honest take on Alex Jones seems to

482
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:57,100
be something more like Alex Jones is kind of like Nostradamus, where he made a

483
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,100
billion predictions.

484
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,660
Most of them are wrong, but the ones are bound to be right.

485
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:02,860
Yeah.

486
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
Some of them are bound to be right.

487
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,060
And the ones that were right are like really high profile.

488
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:06,980
Yes.

489
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,980
They were really high profile.

490
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,460
The wrong side, the ones that he were, that he was wrong with was high profile

491
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,340
too, tiny hook shit that ruined him.

492
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,660
Yeah, that's true enough.

493
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:17,860
Yeah.

494
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,340
He also had some high profile hits, like the whole Epstein shit.

495
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:22,980
Yep.

496
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:30,140
Like I was talking about it, like after hearing about it, I probably didn't even

497
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:36,300
know he was the one who said it at first, but like, uh, I was, I was talking about

498
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:45,060
it back in my fucking 2017 or some shit earlier on, and it was like, I had, it

499
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,820
is just like, like these horrible things that these rich people are doing.

500
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,100
And it's just like, I get looked at and it's just like, I'm looking at,

501
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,540
looked at a lot of like, I'm crazy.

502
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:59,140
Like I'm like, this must be pre QAnon, but like if QAnon existed, I would

503
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,660
have probably got called bad too.

504
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,460
Yeah.

505
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:02,620
Yeah.

506
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,180
I know what you mean.

507
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:10,060
And the worst part is, is like the people who still call him just a conspiracy

508
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:14,820
theorist, they kind of it's like, what the fuck, like, what the fuck are you doing?

509
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,900
He is a character.

510
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:21,300
He's a, he is a conspiracy theorist, but he's also more than that, I think.

511
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:21,980
Yeah.

512
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,420
Yeah.

513
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,260
And, but you see people, so, so when it comes to the mainstream media, they're

514
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,300
protecting, they're, they are protecting their own interests.

515
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,380
They're going to say, Oh, obviously he's a conspiracy theorist.

516
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,460
You guys, but like, then you see, you see like some YouTubers though.

517
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,580
They like, you got like, YouTubers should know better at this point.

518
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,020
We're, we're more on the ground.

519
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,420
We're more like regular people.

520
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,060
We're, we kind of, we're kind of closer to things like you should know better.

521
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,300
We don't purport to be the arbiters of truth.

522
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:45,780
Yeah.

523
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:54,500
We're learning just like you, but it's why we, it's like, we're not the same as

524
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,860
like, like those big media profiles where it's just like, they have an entire team.

525
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,580
Yeah.

526
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,100
Where it's just like.

527
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,940
But also more importantly though, we don't have the same interest that they do

528
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,660
because they're, they're, they're, we don't have the same, we don't have the

529
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,900
people paying us.

530
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,460
Yeah.

531
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,420
It was just like, to tell us what to say and that type of shit.

532
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,260
Yeah.

533
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,140
Real Holzner for $5.

534
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,540
Thank you.

535
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,180
Alex Jones was right in the same way that you're bound to hit your target.

536
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,780
If you aim in the right general direction and are close up with a shotgun.

537
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,380
We're more on the ground is what I mean.

538
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,100
Yes.

539
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,500
Yes.

540
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,940
More on the ground in some ways.

541
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,140
Yeah.

542
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,980
But also like we're, we're less ideologically possessed.

543
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,820
Let's say, you know, like I'm not interested in.

544
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:45,340
We have our own personal biases, but we, we try to like, we don't have like people

545
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,700
telling us like, this is what you need to believe.

546
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,900
Yes, yes, exactly.

547
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,900
So like you have, you might have like a right wing pundit who are like, Alex

548
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,340
Jones is never wrong based.

549
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,340
He freaked out everything.

550
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,940
He knows, he knows what's going on.

551
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,220
Legitimately believe Alex Jones is like, chill the fuck out.

552
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,500
All right.

553
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,820
Then you also have like, like a left wing, like lefty tuber, like a

554
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,780
bread tuber or something.

555
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,060
And they might say something like, if you believe in anything that Alex

556
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,940
Jones says, you're a conspiracy theorist, Nazi, you're part of the problem.

557
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,660
You're radicalizing.

558
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,260
But it's like, both of you guys need to chill the fuck out.

559
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,580
All right.

560
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,540
Like just, just, just calm down.

561
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,300
It admitting that Alex Jones was right about some very bad things

562
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,820
does not make you a bad person.

563
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,420
It does not make you a conspiracy theorist.

564
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:32,820
It doesn't, it, you know, God, the truth is the truth regardless of

565
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,540
the political inconvenience of it.

566
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,340
The question is, has Alex Jones been more or less correct than

567
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,620
the general news companies?

568
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,220
I get that he looks more unhinged, but is he less correct than they were?

569
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,220
I actually don't know.

570
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,820
I think, I think what's actually going on.

571
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:53,540
I think what's actually going on here is that Alex Jones is, has been

572
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,700
more correct about things that the mainstream establishment has

573
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,020
been like vehemently denying.

574
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,020
It's like that never happened.

575
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,100
You can't say that happened.

576
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,500
You can't talk about like those kinds of topics.

577
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,580
Alex Jones has been correct about that.

578
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,420
And I think that's, that's important because if there was no stakes to

579
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:14,620
any of these stories and Alex Jones just said some wild shit, most

580
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,540
people would just ignore it.

581
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,940
Yeah, I think that's what seems, I think that's, what's going on here

582
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,580
is that where he's, where he's correct.

583
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,460
It seems to be kind of a big deal.
