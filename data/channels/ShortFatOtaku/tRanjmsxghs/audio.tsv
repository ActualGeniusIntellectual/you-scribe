0	4700	We cannot prove that we cannot prove at all that there is some kind of political
4700	10020	motivation or some kind of concerted effort to, uh, to take down Alex Jones,
10200	13580	but we can be conspiracy theorists ourselves.
13640	18220	We can stay up until 3 AM with like coffee and cigarettes and pinning things
18220	21220	together on a board with tax and string like pictures.
21220	22700	And we can do that too.
22700	24380	We can be that crazy guy too.
24700	26260	So maybe we should indulge a little bit.
26300	26720	Okay.
27140	31140	So this is an article from December of 2020.
31860	33620	This is mostly regarding COVID stuff.
33980	36880	How should you talk to your friends and relatives who
36880	38280	believe in conspiracy theory?
38280	40140	There is, this is like a lifestyle article.
40140	42280	This is not a serious news piece.
42280	44320	It's a fluff piece, but let's just, let's check it out.
44320	44640	Okay.
45640	49680	You're dreading the moment as your uncle passes the roast potatoes.
49920	53920	He casually mentions that a coronavirus vaccine will be used to inject
53920	56080	microchips into our bodies to track us.
57000	60680	Or maybe it's the point when a friend after a couple of pints starts talking
60680	65220	about how COVID-19 doesn't exist or when, or when pudding is ruined as a long lost
65220	71440	cousin starts spinning lurid tales about QAnon and elite Satanists eating babies.
71740	72500	Oh my God.
73860	75860	So I think I recall this.
75860	80140	It was like 2018 or 2019 Lilith, and you posted a tweet that
80140	81560	inspired a video of mine.
82000	86540	And the tweet was, it was a trans person waving the, the, the, the, the
86540	90680	trans flag, and then having a turkey shoved on their hand in the other hand.
92760	93260	You remember that?
96840	98240	I don't remember that.
98240	98840	What was that?
99040	99300	Okay.
99300	99720	Hold on.
100720	101560	They have a turkey?
101880	102160	Okay.
102160	102960	So I can't find it.
102960	103280	Shit.
103680	109620	I did a video and the thumbnail of the video, there's a trans person with like
109620	114460	brown skin and short purple hair, and they're screeching and they're waving
114460	119980	a trans flag and they have a turkey shoved on their fist in the asshole of
119980	121740	the turkey on the other one.
122100	124860	And it was supposed to be like a trans Thanksgiving thing.
125860	126940	There was that picture.
127220	129460	And you posted that it was a drawing.
129460	130000	It was a drawing.
130280	131420	And someone took that.
132160	136680	No, you took that picture post on your Twitter and you said, this is what these
136680	142200	crazies want you to think trans people are, but we're not this, we're not this
142200	142800	fucking crazy.
142800	145120	I don't remember saying, I, I, sorry.
145120	148520	I, I, it was like four years ago, were you remembering somebody else?
148560	149760	Oh, no, it was, it was definitely you.
149800	152520	I'm trying, I'm trying to remember the turkey.
153640	154320	It was a cooked turkey.
154320	154960	It was a cooked turkey.
155640	160360	I don't, there's nothing like that in my mind, but you might be right.
161240	161440	Okay.
161440	165600	Can I, maybe if like I find a picture you'll know, Hey chat, can you guys
165600	166560	like find that video?
166720	167840	Oh, that one.
167880	168240	Yeah.
168880	172880	So you, you definitely took this and posted it on your Twitter back in the day.
173640	182280	And you were like, yeah, that's such a, but it's such a, okay.
182340	186960	So then the dream, why I feel like you've mentioned it.
187000	189720	I was, I thought it was like, was this a fever dream?
191040	191880	What the hell?
192240	195720	So this, this image, it looks like it's a meme.
195880	201320	It's a fucking joke, but it was used on ironically, it was used on ironically in
201320	206240	like a pro trans Thanksgiving article where it's like how to confront your racist
206240	211120	conservative uncle at Thanksgiving, how to shoot them down and it's like, chill
211120	212400	the fuck out guys, like Jesus.
213400	220080	Yeah, it was, it was used like, like why do you make, that's how you portray trans
220080	223160	people, a crazy pink haired person.
223760	224960	I mean, I'm sure some are.
224960	226960	Fisting a turkey for fuck's sake.
227200	228200	Fisting a turkey.
229840	234400	So why, why, why are they fisting a turkey because their, uh, relatives
234400	237880	drove them so crazy, I guess, but why?
238920	242600	So I'm bringing that up because this article kind of plays off of that, you
242600	248520	know, like how do you deal with crazies, crazies at the dinner table during
248520	251360	holidays, you know, the uncle you only see once a year or whatever.
251680	260120	Now, rather than this being about like LGBT stuff, this is about conspiracy
260120	260640	theories.
260880	264680	How do you deal with your uncle who thinks that a coronavirus vaccine will
264680	269560	inject microchips into your bodies or talking about how COVID doesn't exist or
269560	271400	QAnon or elite Satanists.
271520	276120	Now, first of all, the left itself, they're also, they're also, uh, very in
276120	277280	on the conspiracy theories.
277600	282200	They talk about the globalist bourgeoisie 1%, you know, they, they talk about Bill
282200	285560	Gates just as much like that's, it's not fucking pretend that there's not, this
285560	287520	isn't like a, like a bipartisan thing.
287520	288360	It certainly is.
288600	288960	All right.
289280	294440	But still, how do you talk about conspiracy theories, ruining your,
294440	295920	your family get together?
295960	296400	Okay.
296720	303360	So this, this article gives you like, it's a keep calm, don't be dismissive,
303600	309520	encourage critical thinking, ask questions, don't expect immediate results.
309560	310000	Okay.
310000	313040	So soy, soy, soy, soy, soy, soy.
313080	317000	So let's actually go, what you do is you play into it.
317320	317640	Yeah.
318120	319360	So you play into it.
319360	321880	You, you, you go, you go even crazier.
323720	326800	You go even crazier than, than your, than your relatives.
326800	332600	You go, if they think, if they think like a fucking, if they think that
332600	338480	nine 11 steel beams and shit, you just, just say the tower didn't even exist.
338600	339720	The tower never existed.
340640	341080	Tower.
341080	342520	It never existed.
342640	344320	I mean, has there been proof?
344320	349600	Has anybody, has anybody seen the towers for 20 years?
350080	350840	They vanished.
351280	351640	Okay.
351840	358320	So with Alex Jones being the primary conspiracy theorist peddler, we should
358320	359880	look into some of these conspiracy theories.
359880	360080	Okay.
360080	364120	So for example, this was a good one.
364120	366600	This was like, this is a surface level Alex Jonesery.
366640	367080	Okay.
367720	370440	Remember when Alex Jones said that whenever Silicon Valley gets called
370440	374640	out on their shit, they just throw some Indian out in front to act confused
374640	376320	and say that they don't think they're doing anything wrong.
376600	381360	And that is exactly what Twitter did on the, on the Joe Rogan show a few years
381360	387400	ago, where, uh, Jack showed up with, with this, this Indian woman who was like,
387640	388760	we're, I don't know what you mean.
388760	389640	We're, we're doing okay.
389640	392600	Aren't we like, I don't understand, you know, like that was the meme, you
392600	394400	know, three or four years ago, let's check this one out.
394400	395600	This is from 2019.
395600	395880	Okay.
395880	400520	So about three years ago, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan war leads
400520	402200	to conspiracy theory meltdown.
402600	407360	Infowars host says that babies are being harvested for their organs.
408600	409000	Okay.
410000	411040	It seems pretty crazy, right?
411040	412120	It seems pretty fucking crazy.
412360	412640	Yeah.
413120	418680	Sounds like sounds like Alex Jones, but then, but then.
420160	420760	But then hold on.
421760	425000	So after a recent feud, Jones has invited back on Joe Rogan's show while
425000	427360	speaking with martial arts instructor Eddie Bravo, an episode uploaded on
427360	431200	Wednesday, Jones began shouting about infanticide, I came here and I proved
431200	434320	they're keeping babies alive and they're taking their organs, the Senate voted
434320	438000	Monday to keep it legal, they fucking did it Bravo, and you can't fucking admit
438000	441120	they're, they're killing already born kids, so you're telling me it isn't real
441120	444960	when they had a fucking vote in the God, in the goddamn fucking Senate, that's
444960	449000	the conspiracy theory that Bravo responds, I am ready to beat your fucking ass.
449000	449680	Jones answers.
449680	450720	You think you're fucking tough.
450720	451360	You're about to get it.
451360	451920	Bullshit.
451920	453320	They're killing already born babies.
453480	454400	Stop fucking lying.
454400	455000	God fucking damn it.
455000	455680	I'm getting pissed.
455840	457920	So Jones is going off.
458280	459600	Jones is fucking got a hinge at this point.
459600	460600	I'll beat your fucking ass.
460640	462240	He's fucking crazy.
462600	465360	Um, when, when contact for comment and info wars representative sent
466040	468640	Newsweek articles about late term abortion, including a slate report
468640	471360	dating to 2012, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume
471360	473320	that you're simply ignorant and not malicious, mentally challenged.
473360	473760	Okay.
474360	477200	So Alex Jones is ranting.
477520	480160	This is back in 2019, clear conspiracy theorist.
480640	484160	And this is going to be used to, uh, restrict, restrict abortion
484160	485160	rights and all this shit.
485480	489080	It's going to make people, you can already see the narrative unfold.
489120	491480	This is what a leftoid would say is that Alex Jones need to be
491480	494440	censors because he's going to make things worse for women.
494520	494960	Okay.
495160	497600	Well, what actually, what came out recently.
497760	501720	So this came out, this came out, um, about a year ago, two
501720	505120	years after this rant happened, federal government caught buying
505160	509600	fresh flesh of aborted babies who could have survived as preemies.
511320	515520	So the U S government has been buying and trafficking
515520	517400	fresh aborted baby body parts.
517400	521360	Now, if you, if you believe that if he is as a baby, then the whole,
521360	524760	they're killing babies for their body parts, that language makes sense here.
525280	530840	So, um, these body parts purchased by the U S food and drug administration
530840	535960	to humanize mice and test biologic drugs in scientific experiments came
535960	540040	from babies up to 24 weeks old in gestation, just weeks from being born.
541440	542400	Uh, okay.
543000	545280	That's kind of crazy.
548080	552560	So records indicate that ABR waste not want not.
553080	554240	Waste not want not.
554480	557480	So they were going to get aborted anyways.
557520	557720	Yeah.
558600	565640	Um, so the company, so there's a company called ABR that makes millions.
567400	570800	This company makes millions every year by harvesting organs, like lungs,
571040	575440	livers, eyeballs, and brains from aborted babies and reselling them at profit.
575960	580600	ABR was paid $12,000 upfront per per box of babies.
580880	583080	Some of them were survivable outside of the womb.
583280	587120	Between the gestational age of 16 to 24 weeks, most purchases are
587120	589640	for intact thymuses and livers.
590120	590480	Yeah.
591120	595560	Intact thymuses and liver and livers shipped fresh and on wet ice.
597160	601600	The FDA doctor with the callousness of picking a cut of meat from a butcher
601600	605600	shop, an FDA doctor request tissue samples be procured from a baby boy.
605600	609360	As they claim, it is strongly preferred to have a male fetus if at all possible,
609920	612440	but undetermined sex or female is better than no tissue.
613080	613520	Okay.
614160	616680	So there's, there's, there's this stuff.
617160	619960	Now this, this is from the Federalist and the Federalist has,
619960	621440	has a right wing slant for sure.
621440	625040	So maybe, you know, maybe this is just like, who knows, right?
625040	625760	So we can keep going.
626160	626920	Here's Fox.
627080	630920	Fox is a more mainstream right-wing source, and this is six months later.
631360	636320	Um, six months after this previous report, millions in federal money
636320	642240	flowed to a tissue bank that collected fetal heart gonads, gonads, legs, and brain.
642720	646880	And this, this report came from the university university of Pittsburgh.
648040	648360	Yeah.
648760	652480	So the university of Pittsburgh, the department of health and human services
652480	656120	has funneled at least $2.7 million into a university of Pittsburgh project
656400	658320	that utilizes a tissue bank with Oregon's.
658600	658880	Okay.
658880	661720	So there's like, there's multiple organizations doing this
661720	662640	sort of thing right now.
662680	663040	Okay.
663840	669400	Um, I mean, yeah, it's, it's pretty, it's pretty oof.
669400	678520	Um, so Trump, Trump put a ban on it in 2019.
679080	679560	He banned it.
680080	683680	And this came out of the national library of medicine.
684160	687480	It was just basically a paper signed by some researchers who were
687800	689440	saying that we should not ban it.
689800	693520	And they were saying like this, this tissue is being aborted anyway.
693760	695640	Abortion is still legal in the United States.
695920	698320	And so as long as it's being aborted anyway, this tissue actually
698320	699800	is useful in medical experiments.
700040	702200	There have been good things to come out of it because there's
702200	705800	various medicines and studies and, and, and, and, and whatever the case
705800	709720	may be new data has come out of that has been come out of examining this stuff.
709920	712880	So we shouldn't be stopping it for a moral reason like that, because
712880	713880	they're getting aborted anyway.
714200	718040	And that was their point of view at the, um, at the national library for medicine.
718040	721400	So they, they wrote this paper saying here, we, the undersigned believe
721400	724880	that we should be able to use this, this tissue to solve these problems.
724880	727760	And they mentioned some HIV research that mentioned some other research.
727760	728640	So it's like, okay, fair enough.
728640	729960	Like there is obviously a benefit here.
730360	740760	Um, and then this happened April, 2021 Biden's national Institute of Health
740760	744680	has officially rescinded the ban on using fetal tissues and research on Friday.
744960	749640	So Trump banned it in 2019, Biden unbanned it in 2021.
750080	754280	So there's probably going to be a partisan going back and forth on the use of
754280	756280	these, these body parts for some time.
756520	762000	But the point being is that everyone was calling Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist
762160	766360	back when he yelled and screeched this on the Joe Rogan show, but it turned
766360	768440	out to be at least kind of correct.
770720	774480	And that's the important part is that like, like you, you can, you can move
774480	778400	the goalposts and say, okay, it's true, but we just think it's good.
778720	782480	That's it, but yeah, exactly.
782560	787360	So like the, the, we do it and it's good conversation is a different conversation
787360	788880	than the, we don't do it conversation.
789480	790720	So they were saying, we don't do this.
790720	791480	It's so crazy.
791480	793400	Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist, but it turns out he was
793400	794280	kind of right in that one.
794680	795040	All right.
796280	800200	So then you have to ask, well, what else has Alex Jones said that has turned out
800200	804760	to be true, at least partially, at least from like his own, from his own arguing
804760	807720	position, from his own point of view, from his own definitions, what else
807720	808920	has turned out to be correct?
808960	809320	Okay.
809640	815840	So build, this was back in 2015, Bill Gates is funding a birth control microchip
816120	820360	that lasts 16 years inside of your body and can be turned on or off with a remote
820360	825960	control now, Alex Jones has been talking about microchips in the body for like 20
825960	829840	fucking years now to say that people aren't looking into this just seems to be
829840	833760	ridiculous, yes, people are looking into this and the idea that you could like,
833760	835040	this sounds pretty convenient, right?
835040	839200	Like, Oh, what if, what if I could have a microchip and then for 16 years I can
839200	843440	control whether or not by touching a button on my phone app, whether or not I
843440	846720	can get a girl pregnant, that sounds pretty cool, but then you think about it.
846720	849480	Well, what if it's not you who has the app, but it's the government.
850680	854280	What if you suddenly the government is suddenly these chips are going into
854280	857440	everybody all the time and the government controls your fertility.
857640	859120	That doesn't sound very good either.
860000	863400	So like, yes, there's a convenience argument.
863400	867400	And then there's the, well, what if the Republicans come into power and make
867400	872000	everyone have kids or what if some crazy fucking progressive comes into power and
872000	877680	makes everyone sterile either way, like it should not be some central authorities
877800	880040	position whether or not you should have kids, period.
880360	880680	All right.
881160	887120	So, yes, that's just say that this technology has the real possibility of
887120	889440	getting used for evil and lots of it.
889720	890600	Yes, yes.
890600	894260	So this side, people are like Alex Jones has ranked about microchips and Bill
894300	898180	Gates, but you know what, some of it seems to be at least partially, partially true.
898540	903020	You know, this, this one was kind of goofy where the Australian health chief actually
903020	905460	used the phrase new world order in a speech.
905460	906460	I watched this video.
906860	912740	Um, but basically she says, we will be looking at what contract, we will be
912740	916500	looking at what contract tracing looks like in the new world order.
916740	920740	Yes, it will be pubs and clubs and other things if we have a positive case there,
920940	923700	but our response may be different if we know people are fully vaccinated.
923940	927900	So this is talking about COVID, COVID contact tracing, obviously, but she uses
927900	932340	the phrase new world order, a really dumb fucking phrase to use and the entire
932340	933620	internet lost their mind about it.
933860	935460	So this is probably more of a case of...
935820	940900	You think, you think, you think that these, these government officials would
941300	943140	avoid using those triggering terms.
943220	943740	Yes.
943860	944260	Yes.
944580	947260	And this, this is probably just like a really dumb fuck mistake and not
947260	950180	actually indicative of anything, but you know what it's...
950180	953180	It's like Trudell saying, oh, we're going to have the great reset.
953340	954260	Yes, yes.
954460	957420	Or you have like Klaus Schwab saying that he's injected people into the
957420	962660	cabinets of various, various, uh, various countries, you know, like shit like this
962660	966580	where it's like, it's possible that you guys are absolutely fucking evil or it's
966580	968380	possible you're really fucking dumb.
968580	969660	Like it's, it's possible.
969700	970220	Who knows?
970380	970700	You know?
970780	974260	Or they just might be so evil and they're like blatant about it.
974420	975100	Yes, that too.
975100	975380	That too.
975380	975540	Right.
975540	976300	You don't know.
976660	977420	So yeah.
977860	981020	Or they could just be like idiots, like you said.
981380	985260	Alex Jones has talked about semi comedically, like always ranting and
985260	989540	raving about how the, the 1%, you know, the globalists are sucking the blood of
989540	993620	young people to stay alive and then you have this shit happened in 2020.
993900	995820	Could young blood stop us from getting old?
996580	1000020	And then you have like, you have like rich people who are like getting blood
1000020	1001380	infusions from young people.
1001860	1002900	They remember seeing that shit?
1003100	1004020	Like it's crazy.
1004380	1004940	Okay.
1004940	1009180	But what if, what if we could create young blood without harm?
1010180	1011420	And what if that worked?
1011900	1012460	I mean, I don't know.
1012580	1012940	I don't know.
1013140	1016260	Maybe, but still though, like we're not at that point yet.
1016660	1020500	And so, you know, should old people be getting, just like paying
1020500	1022060	for young blood transfusions?
1022060	1022900	I don't know about that.
1023020	1024420	That seems kind of ridiculous to me.
1025060	1027100	What if the young people get rich from doing that?
1027260	1029500	That's, that'd be a way of redistributing the wealth.
1030180	1030740	I mean, that's true.
1030860	1031260	That's true.
1031260	1031460	Right.
1031860	1036980	The, the, the issue there though, like the, the capitalist, the capitalist
1036980	1038700	in me says, yes, obviously, right.
1038740	1039020	Right.
1039300	1042060	But then, then you have like, like the argument against it seems to be more
1042060	1044740	of a lefty argument where it's like, even if they consent, it's still kind of
1044740	1048740	exploitative, but yes, this is a case of Alex Jones was probably right.
1049820	1050900	No, he was right.
1050940	1051220	Yes.
1051220	1052300	It's another Alex Jones was right.
1052540	1054300	If there's some, if there's some.
1054700	1055700	Backings towards it.
1055860	1057820	It's probably, yep.
1059020	1065660	So also, but then again, then again, that, that, uh, old people have a young blood.
1065660	1067540	That was in Simpsons too, wasn't it?
1067780	1068180	Oh yeah.
1068220	1068460	Yeah.
1068500	1071620	This is a lot of this stuff is, has been floating around the comedy
1071620	1072940	sphere before it turned out to be real.
1073420	1077380	Um, Alex Jones's most famous quote is turning the frogs gay.
1077660	1079700	The chemicals are put in the waters, turn the frogs gay.
1080140	1083580	And then it turned out this came out male frogs may be turning into female.
1083580	1085580	Thanks to estrogen in suburban waste.
1085980	1091380	It, the frogs gay thing is at least the femboy fucking frogs.
1091740	1093580	Femboy Pepe's are out there guys.
1093660	1098300	So basically estrogen waste.
1099020	1103420	So, so the, the idea seems to be that, um, certain foods have a lot more estrogen in it.
1103820	1106260	Uh, women who take birth control, they piss out estrogen.
1106700	1111980	Um, so there's a lot more estrogen in the water supply right now.
1112260	1115740	And that might be leading to certain feminization of things like male, male
1115740	1119300	sperm counts are down, there's some hypothesis that that might be part of it.
1119300	1119900	We don't know yet.
1119900	1122220	Um, it's possible, it's not a conspiracy theory.
1122220	1126060	It's possible, but the frogs gay thing seems to be related to the amount
1126060	1128380	of human estrogen waste in the water.
1128620	1129220	So like,
1131380	1135380	it's very meme-y, but there is some truth to it.
1135420	1135780	Yes.
1135780	1137580	There's some, there's some truth to it, you know,
1137660	1141580	another, another dollar into the Alex Jones was right.
1144580	1147900	Regarding, regarding more implants, Pentagon has developed an implant
1147900	1151020	that can detect COVID that they put underneath your skin.
1151340	1153900	This came out last April, April, 2021.
1155100	1158380	So they've built a micro sensor that goes underneath your skin that
1158380	1160340	can detect your, your health situation.
1160740	1164060	They used it so that they invented it so that soldiers can be, have their
1164060	1165780	health monitor during, during a mission.
1166340	1169260	Um, which I could see how there'd be utility in that if you're, if you're a
1169260	1173740	soldier, but like, it's a pretty cool technology if it works, it's just, it's
1173740	1177820	just, it's just like, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's
1178820	1181900	the obvious question is what if it becomes mandatory?
1182060	1182460	Yes.
1182460	1185580	And also what if it becomes used on civilians and what if it becomes used
1185580	1189580	for more than just health and like, there's so many, like basically Alex
1189580	1193540	Jones talking about microchips and we are, we do seem to be heading slowly in
1193540	1194140	that direction.
1194740	1196300	Um, what else do we have?
1196340	1196660	Oh yeah.
1196660	1202580	So the WHO has published a guidance document for countries and implementing
1202580	1206380	partners on the introduction of digital vaccine certificates.
1206460	1209300	And the work was funded by, by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
1209300	1210460	and the Rockefeller Foundation.
1210860	1215900	So this came out of the WHO's website, digital documentation of COVID-19
1215900	1217900	certificates, vaccination status.
1218060	1223780	So back when COVID started, all of the conspiracy theorists, including Alex
1223780	1227420	Jones said they will never make vaccines mandatory, that was a lie.
1227860	1230100	They will never have vaccine passports, that was a lie.
1230380	1235060	They'll never push for digital ID and digital vaccine certificates.
1235060	1235700	That was a lie.
1236100	1240660	They'll never make you scan your phone going into a business to make, to ensure
1240660	1244500	that you had your vaccine, they'll never actually make you verify it constantly.
1244820	1245500	That was a lie.
1245540	1246580	They'll never restrict movement.
1246580	1247100	That was a lie.
1247460	1254060	Like so many things, they just, people, again, mostly leftists, people, when
1254060	1257060	COVID first hit, they're like, we'll never do this.
1257260	1258700	You're crazy for assuming it.
1258700	1259900	You're crazy for predicting it.
1260100	1264100	Even like, even like leftist YouTubers and stuff said that it was, it was right.
1264140	1266940	Misinformation and disinformation and conspiracy theories.
1266940	1268340	And these people are crazy.
1268340	1270060	They're, they're undermining public trust.
1270060	1272020	They need to be deplatformed fucking everything.
1272300	1274340	And it all came true.
1275860	1277540	It all came fucking true.
1279540	1282540	And I don't like being the guy who has to sit here and say that it came true,
1282540	1283700	but it came fucking true.
1284700	1290540	I've heard people say that, uh, COVID like passports was never going to be a thing.
1290700	1292260	And then it became a thing.
1292580	1294020	And then it became a thing.
1294740	1300300	Like we're not, we're not, we're not anti COVID or anti-vaxxers here.
1300540	1304700	It's not even that big of a deal personally, I think, unless, unless
1304700	1306300	they're like micro-tripping people.
1306300	1311300	It's just like a piece of paper that says, that says like, I, I got, I got a shot.
1311300	1312300	That's, that's fine.
1312300	1314460	They should have never denied it is what I'm saying.
1314540	1314860	Yeah.
1314940	1316340	Well, here's the issue now.
1316380	1318420	Never said, Oh, you're, you're crazy.
1319380	1323060	The issue now seems to be now that they've gone back in so many things and they've
1323060	1324780	tried to rewrite history so many times.
1325060	1327340	Now they're saying we will never microchip you.
1327580	1331860	So everyone is like hyper on edge and they're like, we know what's going on here.
1332020	1336140	We've seen the song and dance that has played out since, since early 2020.
1336380	1336900	You know what I mean?
1336900	1340260	Like everyone is now being like, I know, no, we know what's coming now.
1340500	1341900	You're saying that we're not going to do this.
1342020	1343340	Let's see what happens in a few years.
1343340	1344300	That's what everyone's saying now.
1345380	1345980	Yeah.
1346580	1352540	Um, and then finally the, the biggest, the biggest conspiracy of all the, the girls
1352540	1358860	were just so young, the horrors of Jeffrey Epstein's private Island, Alex Jones, Alex
1358860	1364780	Jones has been talking about the pedophiles in Hollywood and in the news and in the
1364780	1368140	ruling class for anybody.
1368420	1371460	And it was always just crazy conspiracy theories.
1371860	1375940	And then like the Epstein Island thing was, was probably the most blatant example
1375940	1377460	of it, where it happened.
1377700	1381580	We all know that it happened and everyone has agreed just not to talk about it.
1381900	1382540	You know what I mean?
1383660	1385140	Everyone has agreed not to look into it.
1385460	1390860	Every everyone has basically said, no, he clearly, he clearly hung himself, shut the
1390860	1391300	fuck up.
1391340	1395260	And like, everyone knows, everyone knows what, that it's a fiction.
1395420	1397620	Don't question it, don't look into it.
1398620	1404620	So this great meme was sent to me by, um, by Charles Kahn.
1405260	1409220	So how should you talk to friends and relatives who believe conspiracy theories?
1409500	1412020	Here's what you say, Hey bro, you were right about everything.
1412020	1412580	I'm sorry.
1413980	1417580	That's, that's how you fucking deal with someone like Alex Jones.
1418620	1420060	You just, you just admit it.
1420140	1422220	I guess, I guess that's the case.
1422820	1423420	Oh no.
1423980	1427900	Yeah, it's, it's, it's funny how hard our world works.
1427980	1428300	Yeah.
1428860	1432220	What seems to have happened though, my actual honest take on Alex Jones seems to
1432220	1437100	be something more like Alex Jones is kind of like Nostradamus, where he made a
1437100	1438100	billion predictions.
1438740	1442660	Most of them are wrong, but the ones are bound to be right.
1442700	1442860	Yeah.
1442860	1443860	Some of them are bound to be right.
1443860	1446060	And the ones that were right are like really high profile.
1446580	1446980	Yes.
1446980	1447980	They were really high profile.
1449220	1453460	The wrong side, the ones that he were, that he was wrong with was high profile
1453460	1456340	too, tiny hook shit that ruined him.
1456500	1457660	Yeah, that's true enough.
1457660	1457860	Yeah.
1458860	1462340	He also had some high profile hits, like the whole Epstein shit.
1462700	1462980	Yep.
1463620	1470140	Like I was talking about it, like after hearing about it, I probably didn't even
1470140	1476300	know he was the one who said it at first, but like, uh, I was, I was talking about
1476300	1485060	it back in my fucking 2017 or some shit earlier on, and it was like, I had, it
1485140	1488820	is just like, like these horrible things that these rich people are doing.
1488820	1492100	And it's just like, I get looked at and it's just like, I'm looking at,
1492100	1493540	looked at a lot of like, I'm crazy.
1493660	1499140	Like I'm like, this must be pre QAnon, but like if QAnon existed, I would
1499140	1500660	have probably got called bad too.
1502140	1502460	Yeah.
1502500	1502620	Yeah.
1502620	1503180	I know what you mean.
1503740	1510060	And the worst part is, is like the people who still call him just a conspiracy
1510060	1514820	theorist, they kind of it's like, what the fuck, like, what the fuck are you doing?
1514820	1515900	He is a character.
1515900	1521300	He's a, he is a conspiracy theorist, but he's also more than that, I think.
1521620	1521980	Yeah.
1522100	1522420	Yeah.
1523100	1527260	And, but you see people, so, so when it comes to the mainstream media, they're
1527260	1529300	protecting, they're, they are protecting their own interests.
1529300	1531380	They're going to say, Oh, obviously he's a conspiracy theorist.
1531380	1535460	You guys, but like, then you see, you see like some YouTubers though.
1535580	1537580	They like, you got like, YouTubers should know better at this point.
1537580	1539020	We're, we're more on the ground.
1539180	1540420	We're more like regular people.
1540420	1543060	We're, we kind of, we're kind of closer to things like you should know better.
1543060	1545300	We don't purport to be the arbiters of truth.
1545540	1545780	Yeah.
1545780	1554500	We're learning just like you, but it's why we, it's like, we're not the same as
1554500	1559860	like, like those big media profiles where it's just like, they have an entire team.
1560260	1560580	Yeah.
1561260	1562100	Where it's just like.
1563060	1566940	But also more importantly though, we don't have the same interest that they do
1566940	1570660	because they're, they're, they're, we don't have the same, we don't have the
1570660	1571900	people paying us.
1572180	1572460	Yeah.
1573260	1577420	It was just like, to tell us what to say and that type of shit.
1577980	1578260	Yeah.
1578700	1580140	Real Holzner for $5.
1580140	1580540	Thank you.
1581060	1584180	Alex Jones was right in the same way that you're bound to hit your target.
1584180	1587780	If you aim in the right general direction and are close up with a shotgun.
1587860	1589380	We're more on the ground is what I mean.
1589660	1590100	Yes.
1590180	1590500	Yes.
1590580	1591940	More on the ground in some ways.
1591940	1592140	Yeah.
1592500	1595980	But also like we're, we're less ideologically possessed.
1595980	1598820	Let's say, you know, like I'm not interested in.
1598860	1605340	We have our own personal biases, but we, we try to like, we don't have like people
1605340	1607700	telling us like, this is what you need to believe.
1608580	1609900	Yes, yes, exactly.
1610260	1615900	So like you have, you might have like a right wing pundit who are like, Alex
1615900	1617340	Jones is never wrong based.
1617340	1618340	He freaked out everything.
1618340	1619940	He knows, he knows what's going on.
1619940	1622220	Legitimately believe Alex Jones is like, chill the fuck out.
1622220	1622500	All right.
1622740	1625820	Then you also have like, like a left wing, like lefty tuber, like a
1625820	1626780	bread tuber or something.
1626940	1630060	And they might say something like, if you believe in anything that Alex
1630060	1632940	Jones says, you're a conspiracy theorist, Nazi, you're part of the problem.
1632940	1633660	You're radicalizing.
1633660	1636260	But it's like, both of you guys need to chill the fuck out.
1636300	1636580	All right.
1636580	1638540	Like just, just, just calm down.
1638900	1643300	It admitting that Alex Jones was right about some very bad things
1643300	1644820	does not make you a bad person.
1644820	1646420	It does not make you a conspiracy theorist.
1647020	1652820	It doesn't, it, you know, God, the truth is the truth regardless of
1653540	1655540	the political inconvenience of it.
1655940	1659340	The question is, has Alex Jones been more or less correct than
1659340	1660620	the general news companies?
1661700	1665220	I get that he looks more unhinged, but is he less correct than they were?
1665460	1666220	I actually don't know.
1666340	1667820	I think, I think what's actually going on.
1668180	1673540	I think what's actually going on here is that Alex Jones is, has been
1673580	1678700	more correct about things that the mainstream establishment has
1678700	1681020	been like vehemently denying.
1681180	1682020	It's like that never happened.
1682140	1683100	You can't say that happened.
1683140	1685500	You can't talk about like those kinds of topics.
1685700	1687580	Alex Jones has been correct about that.
1687580	1690420	And I think that's, that's important because if there was no stakes to
1690420	1694620	any of these stories and Alex Jones just said some wild shit, most
1694620	1695540	people would just ignore it.
1698060	1701940	Yeah, I think that's what seems, I think that's, what's going on here
1701940	1704580	is that where he's, where he's correct.
1704620	1706460	It seems to be kind of a big deal.
