0	5500	This video is a re-upload from August 2014 with no content changes.
5500	9000	As such, it may not be completely up-to-date.
9000	13000	Any inaccuracies may be explained by its status as a backup.
13000	16500	Completely new Gamergate videos will come in the near future.
16500	17500	Thank you.
31000	32500	Hey guys, Dev here.
32500	34000	It's been a fun week, hasn't it?
34000	37500	Before I get into the heart of this video, I have a couple short things to say.
37500	38500	Here goes.
38500	43000	One, as usual, Cam really did a lot of the legwork on this project.
43000	45000	But she's had the help of four other people.
45000	50000	One wishes to remain anonymous, while the other three are RogueStar, PeterNoOne, and Temin.
50000	54500	And a special thanks to LordKat, who did a livestream breaking this news.
54500	58000	Two, stop fucking harassing people.
58000	62500	Aaron made a long-ass Tumblr post recently, and it basically said people supporting Gamergate
62500	66500	are just as guilty of harassment as people opposing Gamergate.
66500	71500	Listen guys, the sex lives of Zoe Quinn and Nathan Grayson and Maya Kramer and Brandon
71500	77500	Boye and anyone else that comes up is only a matter of public interest if their relationship
77500	81500	points to some form of collusion or conflict of interest.
81500	83500	Otherwise, it's not part of the topic.
84000	88000	There's no excuse for death threats, or rape threats, or threats of violence to Zoe
88000	93000	or Maya or anybody, hell, least of all Sarkeesian because she's barely even connected to this
93000	94000	shit.
94000	96500	And yes, I know all too well that they've done it to us too.
96500	101240	I've seen how the opposing side painted Gamergate with the broad brush of white
101240	104000	cishet male only for NotYourShield to appear.
104000	109000	And I've seen how people opposing Gamergate have desperately tried to prove that NotYourShield
109000	111000	is just some giant elaborate ruse.
111500	115500	I've seen how 4chan has tried to do a legitimately good thing for women in the industry, only
115500	118500	to be shouted down by the other side with remarks like,
118500	120500	Nobody cares about your fucking blood money.
120500	123000	Hell, Camera Lady herself has been a victim of this.
123000	127500	Even beyond getting her Twitter spam reported and suspended, Anthony Burch lamented that
127500	132000	there was no real discussion coming out of this about the ethics of infidelity, that
132000	135000	no one was interested in really talking to him about the real issues.
135000	139000	But when Camera Lady was willing to have that exact discussion, he blocked her.
139000	142740	It's no surprise that Camera Lady considers herself a feminist, but when she disagreed
142740	147700	with Brianna Wu on some feminist point of contention, Brianna called Camera a man because
147700	150500	obviously a woman would never disagree with her.
150500	151500	Right?
151500	155500	We all know that the core people, the people at the centre of the anti-Gamergate crowd,
155500	157140	are not interested in equality.
157140	161500	They speak the language of equality, they talk about gender and race a whole lot, but
161500	166320	they're immediately willing to just completely erase the womanhood or the ethnicity or any
166320	169740	other lived experience of a minority person that dares to oppose them.
169740	174840	To them, minorities are a tool in their toolbox, not actual living, breathing people with their
174840	176380	own issues and opinions.
176380	178680	But this video isn't really for them.
178680	183100	This video is for all of those reasonable-minded people that still oppose Gamergate, to those
183100	187780	people who, simply due to the enormity of the discussion, have yet to truly see the
187780	189300	evidence I'm about to present.
189300	190300	Aaron said,
190300	193320	Gamergate will not win by destroying anybody.
193320	197280	It will win by being rational, cool-headed, and factual.
197280	199520	It will win by converting people.
199520	203400	So if you stand with Gamergate, please show this to people who don't.
203400	207360	And if you stand against Gamergate, if you're truly interested in equality, if you're
207360	212920	an indie dev, or whatever, please, watch this video, examine our evidence for yourself,
212920	214400	and keep an open mind.
214400	215400	3.
215400	219880	I'd like to issue a formal apology to the development team of Crypt of the Necrodancer.
219980	224500	Slope Oak approached Dave on Reddit, in our PC Gaming, to discuss some of the things said
224500	226060	in the Lego Bus video.
226060	231020	First off, props to him for having the balls to step up and publicly reply to the video.
231020	235620	Ever since that video went up, it's been radio-fucking-silence from all the parties
235620	240500	involved, except a short blurb from Silverstream Media that basically says, we deny everything
240500	243860	that's in the video, also please read these articles on how gamers are dead.
243860	248420	Slope Oak mentioned a number of factual errors in his post, and Dave said he will make sure
248440	250840	they're looked into in time for the next video.
250840	255920	While it's true that we made a factual error regarding C418's involvement in Necrodancer,
255920	261400	and that Slope Oak has had four games in the IGF since 2006, the other claims are hard
261400	265000	to independently verify without being able to talk to anybody else.
265000	266280	And no one's talking.
266280	270240	Of course, at the same time, there's also no reason to disbelieve what Slope Oak has
270240	271440	said on the matter either.
271440	273640	Let me quote a part of Dave's Reddit reply,
273860	278060	I don't think anybody seriously thinks there's a giant round table where the journalists
278060	283080	and indie devs and PR people, all in the cool kids club, sit down and actively plan how
283080	285340	to control gaming while shutting out the little guy.
285340	289460	I think what's happened is that the current iteration of indie gaming has grown too big
289460	291680	to even be considered indie itself.
291680	295080	When there was all of a dozen indie people in the world, it didn't matter if they were
295080	297180	friends helping each other out.
297180	298540	But it's not a dozen anymore.
298540	303340	It's thousands of people, with real studios now, with actual games getting made and press
303340	308320	favors being exchanged and money changing hands and award shows, but it still acts like
308320	309320	it's a dozen people.
309320	313160	When it's just two people, they're likely friends, and they'll likely help each other
313160	315060	out as friends are apt to do.
315060	319140	And then it grows into five friends, and then ten friends, and then thousands of people
319140	322900	with significant influence all acting like it's still just a clique.
322900	325820	Indie gaming has grown up, but indie devs have not.
325820	330860	Indie gaming is a real industry now, indie devs have not yet adapted to the larger responsibilities
330860	332740	that come with being in that industry.
332740	336980	The severe disconnect we've seen these past three weeks, how gamers want transparency
336980	340660	in what's going on regarding relationships between devs and journalists and now award
340660	345460	shows, and how indie devs insist it's just their personal life, proves this to be the
345460	346460	case.
346460	348060	This passage cuts to the heart of the matter.
348060	351300	Ultimately, do I think Crypt of the Necrodancer is guilty of anything?
351300	352680	No, I don't.
352680	356340	And even if they were guilty, it's of something very, very minor.
356340	360060	Silverstring is ultimately the party shouldering the majority of the guilt in this specific
360060	361060	situation.
361060	365220	So, I apologize to Slowpoke, and to anybody else who worked on Necrodancer.
365220	366380	It's a really good game.
366380	371420	After seeing how he is publicly willing to respond to criticism, I decided to buy a copy.
371420	375200	And I suggest everybody listening to this go buy one too.
375200	376660	It is legitimately good.
376660	381360	Now, does that mean that the IGF is entirely off the hook, that it's not corrupt or anything?
381360	382360	Of course not.
382360	383440	And let's discuss how.
383440	387660	Dave and Camera Lady both have talked with lawyers about the content of this video, and
387660	389280	were required to state the following.
389280	395160	In 1971, the US Supreme Court decided in the case New York Times Co. vs. United States
395160	400940	403 U.S. 713 that journalists are allowed to report on the contents of illegally leaked
400940	405320	documents provided that they had nothing to do with the original leaking, and that the
405320	408560	contents of the documents are of legitimate public interest.
408560	413400	Later cases added a few clauses relating to Homeland Security, but this landmark decision
413400	417800	has ultimately become a major cornerstone of the freedom of the press to report on sensitive
417800	420300	materials that are a part of public discourse.
420300	425520	Back at the very beginning of all this, Phil Fish's company, Polytron, was doxxed.
425520	429360	His website was hacked, and all the files stored within were put up to download.
429360	433840	Nobody over here supports the doxxing or hacking of Phil Fish or anybody else.
433840	436480	We do not condone the leaking of Polytron's data.
436480	438440	We will not redistribute Polytron's data.
438440	440920	We will not tell you where to get Polytron's data.
440920	444960	In discussing the legitimate news interest contained within Polytron's data, we will
444960	449800	censor all non-relevant information, and we will not provide uncensored versions.
449800	454640	We have nothing to do with the hacking of Polytron, and we evoke New York Times Co.
454640	461200	vs. United States 403 U.S. 713 in our legitimate public discussion of the contents of this
461200	462600	data.
462600	463600	Now then.
463600	465600	Polytron was founded in 2008.
465600	469860	In 2009, Polytron received loans from a number of people in order to help finance the company
469860	471740	and the creation of the game Fez.
471740	476780	On page 19 of the loan contract, there's a table showing who invested, how much they
476780	481340	invested, and what percentage of profit share and voting rights they got in return for their
481340	482340	investment.
482340	484500	Only seven of the people are relevant to this discussion.
484500	489940	Ron Carmel, creator of 2D Boy Nathan Vela, of Capybara Studios
489940	494740	Aaron Asaskin, I think I can't pronounce the name, of App Above
494740	499820	Kelly Santiago, of Ouya, That Game Company, and IndieCade
499900	504060	Jonathan Blow, of EGW Kyle Gabler, of 2D Boy
504060	506840	and Matthew Wagner, of Flashbang Studios
506840	511260	After their successful funding of Fez, these seven developers went on to form a group called
511260	516060	IndieFund, a funding source for independent developers who were looking to encourage the
516060	517940	next wave of game developers.
517940	521700	We can safely consider Fez to be the beta test of the IndieFund project.
521700	526360	In fact, all parties involved seem to consider this to be the case, as a Polytron financial
526360	531120	document shows payments being made back to IndieFund for the original loan.
531120	535120	That being said, the official IndieFund website does not list Fez under its games funded.
535120	536120	Why?
536120	539800	Well, to figure that out, we have to examine the events that took place following the initial
539800	541400	investment into Polytron.
541400	546860	In 2011, the IGF had five members of IndieFund and three members of Polytron's own staff
546860	547860	on the finalists panel.
547860	549200	That's eight judges.
549200	554480	However, before the IGF was to accept submissions for that year, Fez creator Phil Fish had to
554480	556440	announce the delay of the game.
556440	560920	Had Phil finished Fez on time, his game would have been a shoe-in to win the grand prize
560920	562460	at IGF that year.
562460	565660	Next year, Fez is entered into the 2012 IGF.
565660	570240	Games to be nominated for the 2012 IGF are considered from September through December
570240	575720	of 2011, while finalists are examined from January through March of 2012.
575720	581000	The finalist judges for the IGF are made public, and are high profiles within gaming.
581000	586040	They can be indie developers, big name developers, journalists, whatever the chair of the IGF
586040	587040	decides.
587040	588480	It's still not known how they're selected.
588480	593520	The nominations judges are hundreds of anonymous individuals, all the same type of people as
593520	597720	the finalist judges, and due to the tip-offs from a number of indie devs and individuals
597720	602520	involved in the IGF that have come forward requesting to remain anonymous, we know the
602520	605000	following about the IGF judging process.
605000	609640	The previous year's public finalist judges commonly returned to be anonymous nominations
609640	611640	judges the following year.
611640	616340	Judges are assigned games to judge, but can also vote on any other game, even games they're
616340	617400	not assigned to.
617400	621280	For a game to be considered for a finalist position, it needs to have a majority of all
621280	623520	votes cast on it to be positive.
623520	628480	Additionally, we know from the Rotten Cartridge article that games are assigned eight judges,
628480	632040	and that those eight are not even required to play the games they've been given.
632040	634480	So, let's examine what this all means for Fez.
634480	639600	In 2012's IGF, we have eight anonymous nomination judges that have a financial interest in Fez.
640040	645840	We know this because those same people were public finalist judges in 2011.
645840	648520	Fez is one of the games in the nomination pool.
648520	651360	Judges have the power to vote for games that they're not assigned to.
651360	655960	Is it possible that eight judges could anonymously ram a game through by pooling their votes?
655960	657160	It seems like it.
657160	662320	Fez potentially began the IGF 2012 nominations process with a plus-eight bias, and there
662320	664600	would be no way for anybody to know.
664600	668180	And hell, the idea that judges can vote on games that they're not assigned to is already
668180	669180	fucked up.
669580	673500	Imagine you're an IGF judge and you have no conflict of interest regarding any of the
673500	674500	games.
674500	677060	You're scrolling down the list, seeing what catches your eye.
677060	681420	Is it so unreasonable an idea that you would naturally gravitate towards games that already
681420	684460	have a big name, like Fez?
684460	689180	Interestingly enough, the software used by IGF for the anonymous judges was created by
689180	694980	Flashbang Studios, the same studio run by Matthew Wagner, who has a financial interest
694980	696460	in Polytron Corporation.
696460	700300	The IGF's backend was developed by somebody who invested in Fez.
700300	704940	And maybe this is all coincidental, but Fez was allowed through the IGF process twice,
704940	707100	which created a shitstorm in the community.
707100	708100	Remember that?
708100	710860	This has only happened one other time.
710860	715500	Hazard made it through the IGF in 2011, and again in 2012, but at least they had the right
715500	719060	idea to change their name to Anti-Chamber in order to avoid scrutiny.
719060	725380	What makes Hazard, aka Anti-Chamber, interesting is that it is also a game funded by IndieFund.
725700	730180	And maybe it's important to note that the 2012 IGF finalist judge panel had two people
730180	734780	on it also tied to IndieFund and therefore Fez and Anti-Chamber.
734780	740020	Andy Schatz, the dev of Monaco, another game funded by IndieFund, and Robin Hunek, an employee
740020	742860	of IndieFund founder, Kelly Santiago's company.
742860	746760	It's also rather suspect that Brandon Boye, whom you all know from the last video, is
746760	751060	close friends with both Phil Fish and IndieFund members, as they have all publicly stated
751060	752540	multiple times on Twitter.
752580	755700	But what's really suspect to me is this timeline of events.
755700	757380	IGF 2012 opens.
757380	762820	Shortly after the vetting of nominees begins, Phil Fish delays the launch of Fez to April
762820	767340	2012, mere weeks after IGF 2012 is to announce its winners.
767340	769620	Fez then wins IGF awards.
769620	771020	Why is this suspect?
771020	775620	Well, when you inspect the loan agreement from earlier, on page 2, article 6, it states
775620	780540	Polytron shall pay the lenders of the share of gross revenues from the Xbox Live Arcade
780540	786220	version of games sold prior to the 365th day after that version's release date.
786220	791020	Furthermore, Polytron shall pay lenders the share of the gross revenues from the PC version
791020	796260	of the games sold prior to the 183rd day after the version's release date.
796260	797260	What does this mean?
797260	802580	Well, the people who lended money to Phil Fish received the biggest payout the first
802580	809460	365 days Fez is on sale on the XBLA, and the first 183 days Fez is on sale on the PC.
809460	813580	And when would you want to release the game to maximize the profits and payouts?
813580	817940	Right after your game has won a major award and received tons of great press, of course.
817940	823780	Keep in mind, Phil Fish delayed Fez shortly after the vetting of nominees for IGF 2012
823780	828740	began, and he delayed it to launch right after he would later win IGF awards.
828740	834460	Is it possible that Phil Fish knew he was going to win IGF 2012 back in September of
834460	835460	2011?
835460	839140	Now, these are all very interesting questions that the IGF needs to answer.
839140	843580	But regarding just how many pies the indie fund people have stuck their fingers into,
843580	846980	there's something a lot more sinister than just questions.
846980	848840	And that has to do with IndieCade.
848840	850200	You all remember IndieCade, right?
850200	854420	That organization that gave Zoe Quinn's Depression Quest an award while two of its chairs were
854420	857820	her sexual or romantic partners, Robin Arnott and Maya Kramer?
857820	859800	Well, it goes a lot further than that.
859800	864960	We intend to show that IndieCade does not value gaming, integrity, or fairness, only
864960	865960	its own wallet.
865960	870680	Recall, in 2009, Kelly Santiago invested money in Polytrum.
870680	875520	This investment gave her voting rates within the company and a percentage of Fez's profits.
875520	881000	In 2011, Kelly Santiago became the chair of the awards jury at IndieCade.
881000	886680	Interestingly, 2011 was the year in which Fez brought home two awards, Disciplinary
886680	892480	Excellence in Story and World Design, and General Excellence by Grand Jury.
892480	897320	IndieCade's own rules state that the jury that selects these awards is made up of 100
897320	902000	anonymous individuals, but that the jury's awards chair works with each of the jurors
902000	904760	to cast their vote.
904760	906760	Read it again.
906760	908520	Read it again.
908520	915520	Kelly Santiago, chair of the IC's awards jury, having a direct financial interest in Fez,
915520	920560	works with the jurors judging Fez to determine their vote in a festival that Fez won two
920560	921560	awards.
921560	926480	With her hands, in every vote cast, and with her having money in Fez, is it any wonder
926480	927760	that Fez won?
927760	932520	If this is true, and I believe it is, IndieCade is guilty of siphoning individual funds through
932520	937460	ticket sales and sponsorship money as prize money for Fez's awards, which is then recycled
937460	939720	back into the pockets of those investors.
939720	943920	Phil Fish gets a fat payday from his pals, who also get a cut due to their loan agreement,
943920	947960	and it all comes out of the pockets of the people who attend and sponsor IndieCade.
948000	952040	Ultimately, IndieFund appears to be guilty of manipulating events at both IndieCade and
952040	956880	the IGF in order to maximize their profit margins on Fez, to the detriment of all indie
956880	960600	developers that enter those events, as well as the gaming public.
960600	965760	This collusion between IndieFund, the IGF, and IndieCade has lined the pockets of all
965760	970960	involved while treating the other indie entrants to their contests with extreme disrespect.
970960	976080	As well as everyone who bought Fez, who thought Fez won its awards on merit alone, anyone
976080	982000	who wrote an article on Fez, the IGF, or IndieCade, and all gamers anywhere who truly
982000	986960	believe that the indie gaming scene would be a safe haven for all the corrupt bullshit
986960	992000	that plagues AAA gaming, they have collectively spat in the faces of everyone who look up
992000	996080	to them, and I don't mean just by releasing ten shitty articles all within the course
996080	998480	of a day decrying the death of the gamer.
998480	1002640	If Fez receives such preferential treatment thanks to IndieFund, what other games have
1002640	1004080	also gotten a boost?
1004080	1009040	Did other IndieFund backed games such as Monaco, Antichamber, Dear Esther, and Zoe
1009040	1015000	Quinn's own Framed also receive special treatment in the awards that they won due to their backers'
1015000	1016480	hands in the cookie jar?
1016480	1020520	What other companies does Kelly Santiago have a vested financial interest in?
1020520	1024400	Why aren't any of these interests disclosed to the public, or even the developers that
1024400	1025840	apply to these events?
1025840	1029760	Of the journalists that covered this, how many of them were incentivized by IndieFund
1029760	1031520	to cover these games positively?
1031520	1034520	When Polytron was hacked, nobody really looked too deeply into it.
1034520	1038440	There was a gigantic shitstorm on V in Reddit, a lot of laughs were had, and then it was
1038440	1039440	forgotten.
1039440	1044000	Nobody, including us, really think to look too deeply into it until we discovered the
1044000	1047320	trail of crumbs leading back to the IGF in the last video.
1047320	1051200	People who are currently invested in Gamergate, don't let anybody fool you.
1051200	1052580	This is not about misogyny.
1052580	1054900	We decry misogyny at every turn.
1054900	1059040	This is not a matter of conservative, hateful gamers versus liberal minorities who are oppressed.
1059040	1060760	We're all very liberal over here.
1060760	1064960	We believe in equal rights, in separation of church and state, in the social safety
1064960	1065960	net, all that stuff.
1065960	1070640	But we also believe in objective journalism, in freedom of the press, in the right of people
1070640	1074760	to know exactly what kind of bullshit corruption is happening in the hobby they are so very
1074760	1075880	passionate about.
1075880	1080480	This is about corruption, nothing else, and don't let anybody say otherwise.
1080480	1084120	People who are currently anti-Gamergate, please rewatch this video.
1084120	1086080	Examine my evidence for yourself.
1086080	1090560	You're being used by a tiny clique of devs and journalists who care nothing for you other
1090560	1094160	than that you're willing to push their narrative for them free of charge.
1094160	1097200	They don't want you to see the side of them presented in this video.
1097200	1099360	They don't want you to examine this evidence.
1099360	1101440	You need proof of this?
1101440	1105240	Look at the indie devs who have been outright excommunicated from the industry for daring
1105240	1106560	to ask questions.
1106560	1110640	Look at Wolf Wozniak who was shouted down for confessing that Zoe Quinn assaulted him.
1110640	1112160	Who's victim blaming now?
1112160	1114800	Who's the true peddler of rape culture?
1114800	1118000	Please look around you and determine who's really fighting for things like truth and
1118000	1119000	equality.
1119000	1123760	Look at those core group of devs and journalists who use the blanket of social justice to shield
1123760	1128000	themselves from criticisms of their corruption, who grab minorities and forcibly shove them
1128000	1131040	in front of the bullets flying at their head.
1131040	1132340	Your time here is limited.
1132340	1137040	Whether it be due to the slow eventual death of your bent-ass websites or impending legal
1137040	1141020	action against you, which I am entirely willing to cooperate with should anybody view this
1141020	1145720	video and decide to take it on, we won't allow you to ruin our hobby for your own personal
1145720	1146720	game.
1146720	1147720	Gamers are not dead.
1147720	1157240	But with the advent of YouTube personalities, gaming journalism might as well be.
1157240	1159140	Here's a quick addendum for you.
1159140	1163560	Since Lordcat did his stream a couple hours before this was recorded, Matthew from the
1163560	1167440	IGF showed up in the Burgers and Fries channel to try and clear some things up.
1167440	1170320	He was asked a very simple question.
1170320	1173360	Was there conflict of interest regarding Fez's win?
1173360	1178400	It takes him two minutes, and then he says, I haven't really thought about it until this
1178400	1179400	morning.
1179400	1183080	In his visit to Burgers and Fries, Matt confirms three other things.
1183080	1184080	1.
1184080	1188240	Fez was in fact funded by the group that would later become IndieFund.
1188240	1189240	2.
1189240	1194120	Matt confirms the IGF juror tool cannot scan for conflict of interest.
1194120	1197040	Jurors have to recuse themselves on their own.
1197040	1198680	It works on an honor system.
1198680	1199680	3.
1199680	1202640	Matt denies connection to Fez in 2012.
1202640	1205200	The Polytron documents seem to go against this.
