This video is a re-upload from August 2014 with no content changes.

00:05.500 --> 00:09.000
As such, it may not be completely up-to-date.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Any inaccuracies may be explained by its status as a backup.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.500
Completely new Gamergate videos will come in the near future.

00:16.500 --> 00:17.500
Thank you.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.500
Hey guys, Dev here.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.000
It's been a fun week, hasn't it?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.500
Before I get into the heart of this video, I have a couple short things to say.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.500
Here goes.

00:38.500 --> 00:43.000
One, as usual, Cam really did a lot of the legwork on this project.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
But she's had the help of four other people.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
One wishes to remain anonymous, while the other three are RogueStar, PeterNoOne, and Temin.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.500
And a special thanks to LordKat, who did a livestream breaking this news.

00:54.500 --> 00:58.000
Two, stop fucking harassing people.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.500
Aaron made a long-ass Tumblr post recently, and it basically said people supporting Gamergate

01:02.500 --> 01:06.500
are just as guilty of harassment as people opposing Gamergate.

01:06.500 --> 01:11.500
Listen guys, the sex lives of Zoe Quinn and Nathan Grayson and Maya Kramer and Brandon

01:11.500 --> 01:17.500
Boye and anyone else that comes up is only a matter of public interest if their relationship

01:17.500 --> 01:21.500
points to some form of collusion or conflict of interest.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.500
Otherwise, it's not part of the topic.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
There's no excuse for death threats, or rape threats, or threats of violence to Zoe

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
or Maya or anybody, hell, least of all Sarkeesian because she's barely even connected to this

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
shit.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.500
And yes, I know all too well that they've done it to us too.

01:36.500 --> 01:41.240
I've seen how the opposing side painted Gamergate with the broad brush of white

01:41.240 --> 01:44.000
cishet male only for NotYourShield to appear.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
And I've seen how people opposing Gamergate have desperately tried to prove that NotYourShield

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
is just some giant elaborate ruse.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.500
I've seen how 4chan has tried to do a legitimately good thing for women in the industry, only

01:55.500 --> 01:58.500
to be shouted down by the other side with remarks like,

01:58.500 --> 02:00.500
Nobody cares about your fucking blood money.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.000
Hell, Camera Lady herself has been a victim of this.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.500
Even beyond getting her Twitter spam reported and suspended, Anthony Burch lamented that

02:07.500 --> 02:12.000
there was no real discussion coming out of this about the ethics of infidelity, that

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
no one was interested in really talking to him about the real issues.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
But when Camera Lady was willing to have that exact discussion, he blocked her.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.740
It's no surprise that Camera Lady considers herself a feminist, but when she disagreed

02:22.740 --> 02:27.700
with Brianna Wu on some feminist point of contention, Brianna called Camera a man because

02:27.700 --> 02:30.500
obviously a woman would never disagree with her.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.500
Right?

02:31.500 --> 02:35.500
We all know that the core people, the people at the centre of the anti-Gamergate crowd,

02:35.500 --> 02:37.140
are not interested in equality.

02:37.140 --> 02:41.500
They speak the language of equality, they talk about gender and race a whole lot, but

02:41.500 --> 02:46.320
they're immediately willing to just completely erase the womanhood or the ethnicity or any

02:46.320 --> 02:49.740
other lived experience of a minority person that dares to oppose them.

02:49.740 --> 02:54.840
To them, minorities are a tool in their toolbox, not actual living, breathing people with their

02:54.840 --> 02:56.380
own issues and opinions.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.680
But this video isn't really for them.

02:58.680 --> 03:03.100
This video is for all of those reasonable-minded people that still oppose Gamergate, to those

03:03.100 --> 03:07.780
people who, simply due to the enormity of the discussion, have yet to truly see the

03:07.780 --> 03:09.300
evidence I'm about to present.

03:09.300 --> 03:10.300
Aaron said,

03:10.300 --> 03:13.320
Gamergate will not win by destroying anybody.

03:13.320 --> 03:17.280
It will win by being rational, cool-headed, and factual.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.520
It will win by converting people.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.400
So if you stand with Gamergate, please show this to people who don't.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.360
And if you stand against Gamergate, if you're truly interested in equality, if you're

03:27.360 --> 03:32.920
an indie dev, or whatever, please, watch this video, examine our evidence for yourself,

03:32.920 --> 03:34.400
and keep an open mind.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.400
3.

03:35.400 --> 03:39.880
I'd like to issue a formal apology to the development team of Crypt of the Necrodancer.

03:39.980 --> 03:44.500
Slope Oak approached Dave on Reddit, in our PC Gaming, to discuss some of the things said

03:44.500 --> 03:46.060
in the Lego Bus video.

03:46.060 --> 03:51.020
First off, props to him for having the balls to step up and publicly reply to the video.

03:51.020 --> 03:55.620
Ever since that video went up, it's been radio-fucking-silence from all the parties

03:55.620 --> 04:00.500
involved, except a short blurb from Silverstream Media that basically says, we deny everything

04:00.500 --> 04:03.860
that's in the video, also please read these articles on how gamers are dead.

04:03.860 --> 04:08.420
Slope Oak mentioned a number of factual errors in his post, and Dave said he will make sure

04:08.440 --> 04:10.840
they're looked into in time for the next video.

04:10.840 --> 04:15.920
While it's true that we made a factual error regarding C418's involvement in Necrodancer,

04:15.920 --> 04:21.400
and that Slope Oak has had four games in the IGF since 2006, the other claims are hard

04:21.400 --> 04:25.000
to independently verify without being able to talk to anybody else.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.280
And no one's talking.

04:26.280 --> 04:30.240
Of course, at the same time, there's also no reason to disbelieve what Slope Oak has

04:30.240 --> 04:31.440
said on the matter either.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.640
Let me quote a part of Dave's Reddit reply,

04:33.860 --> 04:38.060
I don't think anybody seriously thinks there's a giant round table where the journalists

04:38.060 --> 04:43.080
and indie devs and PR people, all in the cool kids club, sit down and actively plan how

04:43.080 --> 04:45.340
to control gaming while shutting out the little guy.

04:45.340 --> 04:49.460
I think what's happened is that the current iteration of indie gaming has grown too big

04:49.460 --> 04:51.680
to even be considered indie itself.

04:51.680 --> 04:55.080
When there was all of a dozen indie people in the world, it didn't matter if they were

04:55.080 --> 04:57.180
friends helping each other out.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.540
But it's not a dozen anymore.

04:58.540 --> 05:03.340
It's thousands of people, with real studios now, with actual games getting made and press

05:03.340 --> 05:08.320
favors being exchanged and money changing hands and award shows, but it still acts like

05:08.320 --> 05:09.320
it's a dozen people.

05:09.320 --> 05:13.160
When it's just two people, they're likely friends, and they'll likely help each other

05:13.160 --> 05:15.060
out as friends are apt to do.

05:15.060 --> 05:19.140
And then it grows into five friends, and then ten friends, and then thousands of people

05:19.140 --> 05:22.900
with significant influence all acting like it's still just a clique.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.820
Indie gaming has grown up, but indie devs have not.

05:25.820 --> 05:30.860
Indie gaming is a real industry now, indie devs have not yet adapted to the larger responsibilities

05:30.860 --> 05:32.740
that come with being in that industry.

05:32.740 --> 05:36.980
The severe disconnect we've seen these past three weeks, how gamers want transparency

05:36.980 --> 05:40.660
in what's going on regarding relationships between devs and journalists and now award

05:40.660 --> 05:45.460
shows, and how indie devs insist it's just their personal life, proves this to be the

05:45.460 --> 05:46.460
case.

05:46.460 --> 05:48.060
This passage cuts to the heart of the matter.

05:48.060 --> 05:51.300
Ultimately, do I think Crypt of the Necrodancer is guilty of anything?

05:51.300 --> 05:52.680
No, I don't.

05:52.680 --> 05:56.340
And even if they were guilty, it's of something very, very minor.

05:56.340 --> 06:00.060
Silverstring is ultimately the party shouldering the majority of the guilt in this specific

06:00.060 --> 06:01.060
situation.

06:01.060 --> 06:05.220
So, I apologize to Slowpoke, and to anybody else who worked on Necrodancer.

06:05.220 --> 06:06.380
It's a really good game.

06:06.380 --> 06:11.420
After seeing how he is publicly willing to respond to criticism, I decided to buy a copy.

06:11.420 --> 06:15.200
And I suggest everybody listening to this go buy one too.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.660
It is legitimately good.

06:16.660 --> 06:21.360
Now, does that mean that the IGF is entirely off the hook, that it's not corrupt or anything?

06:21.360 --> 06:22.360
Of course not.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.440
And let's discuss how.

06:23.440 --> 06:27.660
Dave and Camera Lady both have talked with lawyers about the content of this video, and

06:27.660 --> 06:29.280
were required to state the following.

06:29.280 --> 06:35.160
In 1971, the US Supreme Court decided in the case New York Times Co. vs. United States

06:35.160 --> 06:40.940
403 U.S. 713 that journalists are allowed to report on the contents of illegally leaked

06:40.940 --> 06:45.320
documents provided that they had nothing to do with the original leaking, and that the

06:45.320 --> 06:48.560
contents of the documents are of legitimate public interest.

06:48.560 --> 06:53.400
Later cases added a few clauses relating to Homeland Security, but this landmark decision

06:53.400 --> 06:57.800
has ultimately become a major cornerstone of the freedom of the press to report on sensitive

06:57.800 --> 07:00.300
materials that are a part of public discourse.

07:00.300 --> 07:05.520
Back at the very beginning of all this, Phil Fish's company, Polytron, was doxxed.

07:05.520 --> 07:09.360
His website was hacked, and all the files stored within were put up to download.

07:09.360 --> 07:13.840
Nobody over here supports the doxxing or hacking of Phil Fish or anybody else.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.480
We do not condone the leaking of Polytron's data.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.440
We will not redistribute Polytron's data.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.920
We will not tell you where to get Polytron's data.

07:20.920 --> 07:24.960
In discussing the legitimate news interest contained within Polytron's data, we will

07:24.960 --> 07:29.800
censor all non-relevant information, and we will not provide uncensored versions.

07:29.800 --> 07:34.640
We have nothing to do with the hacking of Polytron, and we evoke New York Times Co.

07:34.640 --> 07:41.200
vs. United States 403 U.S. 713 in our legitimate public discussion of the contents of this

07:41.200 --> 07:42.600
data.

07:42.600 --> 07:43.600
Now then.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.600
Polytron was founded in 2008.

07:45.600 --> 07:49.860
In 2009, Polytron received loans from a number of people in order to help finance the company

07:49.860 --> 07:51.740
and the creation of the game Fez.

07:51.740 --> 07:56.780
On page 19 of the loan contract, there's a table showing who invested, how much they

07:56.780 --> 08:01.340
invested, and what percentage of profit share and voting rights they got in return for their

08:01.340 --> 08:02.340
investment.

08:02.340 --> 08:04.500
Only seven of the people are relevant to this discussion.

08:04.500 --> 08:09.940
Ron Carmel, creator of 2D Boy Nathan Vela, of Capybara Studios

08:09.940 --> 08:14.740
Aaron Asaskin, I think I can't pronounce the name, of App Above

08:14.740 --> 08:19.820
Kelly Santiago, of Ouya, That Game Company, and IndieCade

08:19.900 --> 08:24.060
Jonathan Blow, of EGW Kyle Gabler, of 2D Boy

08:24.060 --> 08:26.840
and Matthew Wagner, of Flashbang Studios

08:26.840 --> 08:31.260
After their successful funding of Fez, these seven developers went on to form a group called

08:31.260 --> 08:36.060
IndieFund, a funding source for independent developers who were looking to encourage the

08:36.060 --> 08:37.940
next wave of game developers.

08:37.940 --> 08:41.700
We can safely consider Fez to be the beta test of the IndieFund project.

08:41.700 --> 08:46.360
In fact, all parties involved seem to consider this to be the case, as a Polytron financial

08:46.360 --> 08:51.120
document shows payments being made back to IndieFund for the original loan.

08:51.120 --> 08:55.120
That being said, the official IndieFund website does not list Fez under its games funded.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.120
Why?

08:56.120 --> 08:59.800
Well, to figure that out, we have to examine the events that took place following the initial

08:59.800 --> 09:01.400
investment into Polytron.

09:01.400 --> 09:06.860
In 2011, the IGF had five members of IndieFund and three members of Polytron's own staff

09:06.860 --> 09:07.860
on the finalists panel.

09:07.860 --> 09:09.200
That's eight judges.

09:09.200 --> 09:14.480
However, before the IGF was to accept submissions for that year, Fez creator Phil Fish had to

09:14.480 --> 09:16.440
announce the delay of the game.

09:16.440 --> 09:20.920
Had Phil finished Fez on time, his game would have been a shoe-in to win the grand prize

09:20.920 --> 09:22.460
at IGF that year.

09:22.460 --> 09:25.660
Next year, Fez is entered into the 2012 IGF.

09:25.660 --> 09:30.240
Games to be nominated for the 2012 IGF are considered from September through December

09:30.240 --> 09:35.720
of 2011, while finalists are examined from January through March of 2012.

09:35.720 --> 09:41.000
The finalist judges for the IGF are made public, and are high profiles within gaming.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.040
They can be indie developers, big name developers, journalists, whatever the chair of the IGF

09:46.040 --> 09:47.040
decides.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.480
It's still not known how they're selected.

09:48.480 --> 09:53.520
The nominations judges are hundreds of anonymous individuals, all the same type of people as

09:53.520 --> 09:57.720
the finalist judges, and due to the tip-offs from a number of indie devs and individuals

09:57.720 --> 10:02.520
involved in the IGF that have come forward requesting to remain anonymous, we know the

10:02.520 --> 10:05.000
following about the IGF judging process.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.640
The previous year's public finalist judges commonly returned to be anonymous nominations

10:09.640 --> 10:11.640
judges the following year.

10:11.640 --> 10:16.340
Judges are assigned games to judge, but can also vote on any other game, even games they're

10:16.340 --> 10:17.400
not assigned to.

10:17.400 --> 10:21.280
For a game to be considered for a finalist position, it needs to have a majority of all

10:21.280 --> 10:23.520
votes cast on it to be positive.

10:23.520 --> 10:28.480
Additionally, we know from the Rotten Cartridge article that games are assigned eight judges,

10:28.480 --> 10:32.040
and that those eight are not even required to play the games they've been given.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.480
So, let's examine what this all means for Fez.

10:34.480 --> 10:39.600
In 2012's IGF, we have eight anonymous nomination judges that have a financial interest in Fez.

10:40.040 --> 10:45.840
We know this because those same people were public finalist judges in 2011.

10:45.840 --> 10:48.520
Fez is one of the games in the nomination pool.

10:48.520 --> 10:51.360
Judges have the power to vote for games that they're not assigned to.

10:51.360 --> 10:55.960
Is it possible that eight judges could anonymously ram a game through by pooling their votes?

10:55.960 --> 10:57.160
It seems like it.

10:57.160 --> 11:02.320
Fez potentially began the IGF 2012 nominations process with a plus-eight bias, and there

11:02.320 --> 11:04.600
would be no way for anybody to know.

11:04.600 --> 11:08.180
And hell, the idea that judges can vote on games that they're not assigned to is already

11:08.180 --> 11:09.180
fucked up.

11:09.580 --> 11:13.500
Imagine you're an IGF judge and you have no conflict of interest regarding any of the

11:13.500 --> 11:14.500
games.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.060
You're scrolling down the list, seeing what catches your eye.

11:17.060 --> 11:21.420
Is it so unreasonable an idea that you would naturally gravitate towards games that already

11:21.420 --> 11:24.460
have a big name, like Fez?

11:24.460 --> 11:29.180
Interestingly enough, the software used by IGF for the anonymous judges was created by

11:29.180 --> 11:34.980
Flashbang Studios, the same studio run by Matthew Wagner, who has a financial interest

11:34.980 --> 11:36.460
in Polytron Corporation.

11:36.460 --> 11:40.300
The IGF's backend was developed by somebody who invested in Fez.

11:40.300 --> 11:44.940
And maybe this is all coincidental, but Fez was allowed through the IGF process twice,

11:44.940 --> 11:47.100
which created a shitstorm in the community.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.100
Remember that?

11:48.100 --> 11:50.860
This has only happened one other time.

11:50.860 --> 11:55.500
Hazard made it through the IGF in 2011, and again in 2012, but at least they had the right

11:55.500 --> 11:59.060
idea to change their name to Anti-Chamber in order to avoid scrutiny.

11:59.060 --> 12:05.380
What makes Hazard, aka Anti-Chamber, interesting is that it is also a game funded by IndieFund.

12:05.700 --> 12:10.180
And maybe it's important to note that the 2012 IGF finalist judge panel had two people

12:10.180 --> 12:14.780
on it also tied to IndieFund and therefore Fez and Anti-Chamber.

12:14.780 --> 12:20.020
Andy Schatz, the dev of Monaco, another game funded by IndieFund, and Robin Hunek, an employee

12:20.020 --> 12:22.860
of IndieFund founder, Kelly Santiago's company.

12:22.860 --> 12:26.760
It's also rather suspect that Brandon Boye, whom you all know from the last video, is

12:26.760 --> 12:31.060
close friends with both Phil Fish and IndieFund members, as they have all publicly stated

12:31.060 --> 12:32.540
multiple times on Twitter.

12:32.580 --> 12:35.700
But what's really suspect to me is this timeline of events.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.380
IGF 2012 opens.

12:37.380 --> 12:42.820
Shortly after the vetting of nominees begins, Phil Fish delays the launch of Fez to April

12:42.820 --> 12:47.340
2012, mere weeks after IGF 2012 is to announce its winners.

12:47.340 --> 12:49.620
Fez then wins IGF awards.

12:49.620 --> 12:51.020
Why is this suspect?

12:51.020 --> 12:55.620
Well, when you inspect the loan agreement from earlier, on page 2, article 6, it states

12:55.620 --> 13:00.540
Polytron shall pay the lenders of the share of gross revenues from the Xbox Live Arcade

13:00.540 --> 13:06.220
version of games sold prior to the 365th day after that version's release date.

13:06.220 --> 13:11.020
Furthermore, Polytron shall pay lenders the share of the gross revenues from the PC version

13:11.020 --> 13:16.260
of the games sold prior to the 183rd day after the version's release date.

13:16.260 --> 13:17.260
What does this mean?

13:17.260 --> 13:22.580
Well, the people who lended money to Phil Fish received the biggest payout the first

13:22.580 --> 13:29.460
365 days Fez is on sale on the XBLA, and the first 183 days Fez is on sale on the PC.

13:29.460 --> 13:33.580
And when would you want to release the game to maximize the profits and payouts?

13:33.580 --> 13:37.940
Right after your game has won a major award and received tons of great press, of course.

13:37.940 --> 13:43.780
Keep in mind, Phil Fish delayed Fez shortly after the vetting of nominees for IGF 2012

13:43.780 --> 13:48.740
began, and he delayed it to launch right after he would later win IGF awards.

13:48.740 --> 13:54.460
Is it possible that Phil Fish knew he was going to win IGF 2012 back in September of

13:54.460 --> 13:55.460
2011?

13:55.460 --> 13:59.140
Now, these are all very interesting questions that the IGF needs to answer.

13:59.140 --> 14:03.580
But regarding just how many pies the indie fund people have stuck their fingers into,

14:03.580 --> 14:06.980
there's something a lot more sinister than just questions.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.840
And that has to do with IndieCade.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.200
You all remember IndieCade, right?

14:10.200 --> 14:14.420
That organization that gave Zoe Quinn's Depression Quest an award while two of its chairs were

14:14.420 --> 14:17.820
her sexual or romantic partners, Robin Arnott and Maya Kramer?

14:17.820 --> 14:19.800
Well, it goes a lot further than that.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.960
We intend to show that IndieCade does not value gaming, integrity, or fairness, only

14:24.960 --> 14:25.960
its own wallet.

14:25.960 --> 14:30.680
Recall, in 2009, Kelly Santiago invested money in Polytrum.

14:30.680 --> 14:35.520
This investment gave her voting rates within the company and a percentage of Fez's profits.

14:35.520 --> 14:41.000
In 2011, Kelly Santiago became the chair of the awards jury at IndieCade.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.680
Interestingly, 2011 was the year in which Fez brought home two awards, Disciplinary

14:46.680 --> 14:52.480
Excellence in Story and World Design, and General Excellence by Grand Jury.

14:52.480 --> 14:57.320
IndieCade's own rules state that the jury that selects these awards is made up of 100

14:57.320 --> 15:02.000
anonymous individuals, but that the jury's awards chair works with each of the jurors

15:02.000 --> 15:04.760
to cast their vote.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.760
Read it again.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.520
Read it again.

15:08.520 --> 15:15.520
Kelly Santiago, chair of the IC's awards jury, having a direct financial interest in Fez,

15:15.520 --> 15:20.560
works with the jurors judging Fez to determine their vote in a festival that Fez won two

15:20.560 --> 15:21.560
awards.

15:21.560 --> 15:26.480
With her hands, in every vote cast, and with her having money in Fez, is it any wonder

15:26.480 --> 15:27.760
that Fez won?

15:27.760 --> 15:32.520
If this is true, and I believe it is, IndieCade is guilty of siphoning individual funds through

15:32.520 --> 15:37.460
ticket sales and sponsorship money as prize money for Fez's awards, which is then recycled

15:37.460 --> 15:39.720
back into the pockets of those investors.

15:39.720 --> 15:43.920
Phil Fish gets a fat payday from his pals, who also get a cut due to their loan agreement,

15:43.920 --> 15:47.960
and it all comes out of the pockets of the people who attend and sponsor IndieCade.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.040
Ultimately, IndieFund appears to be guilty of manipulating events at both IndieCade and

15:52.040 --> 15:56.880
the IGF in order to maximize their profit margins on Fez, to the detriment of all indie

15:56.880 --> 16:00.600
developers that enter those events, as well as the gaming public.

16:00.600 --> 16:05.760
This collusion between IndieFund, the IGF, and IndieCade has lined the pockets of all

16:05.760 --> 16:10.960
involved while treating the other indie entrants to their contests with extreme disrespect.

16:10.960 --> 16:16.080
As well as everyone who bought Fez, who thought Fez won its awards on merit alone, anyone

16:16.080 --> 16:22.000
who wrote an article on Fez, the IGF, or IndieCade, and all gamers anywhere who truly

16:22.000 --> 16:26.960
believe that the indie gaming scene would be a safe haven for all the corrupt bullshit

16:26.960 --> 16:32.000
that plagues AAA gaming, they have collectively spat in the faces of everyone who look up

16:32.000 --> 16:36.080
to them, and I don't mean just by releasing ten shitty articles all within the course

16:36.080 --> 16:38.480
of a day decrying the death of the gamer.

16:38.480 --> 16:42.640
If Fez receives such preferential treatment thanks to IndieFund, what other games have

16:42.640 --> 16:44.080
also gotten a boost?

16:44.080 --> 16:49.040
Did other IndieFund backed games such as Monaco, Antichamber, Dear Esther, and Zoe

16:49.040 --> 16:55.000
Quinn's own Framed also receive special treatment in the awards that they won due to their backers'

16:55.000 --> 16:56.480
hands in the cookie jar?

16:56.480 --> 17:00.520
What other companies does Kelly Santiago have a vested financial interest in?

17:00.520 --> 17:04.400
Why aren't any of these interests disclosed to the public, or even the developers that

17:04.400 --> 17:05.840
apply to these events?

17:05.840 --> 17:09.760
Of the journalists that covered this, how many of them were incentivized by IndieFund

17:09.760 --> 17:11.520
to cover these games positively?

17:11.520 --> 17:14.520
When Polytron was hacked, nobody really looked too deeply into it.

17:14.520 --> 17:18.440
There was a gigantic shitstorm on V in Reddit, a lot of laughs were had, and then it was

17:18.440 --> 17:19.440
forgotten.

17:19.440 --> 17:24.000
Nobody, including us, really think to look too deeply into it until we discovered the

17:24.000 --> 17:27.320
trail of crumbs leading back to the IGF in the last video.

17:27.320 --> 17:31.200
People who are currently invested in Gamergate, don't let anybody fool you.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.580
This is not about misogyny.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.900
We decry misogyny at every turn.

17:34.900 --> 17:39.040
This is not a matter of conservative, hateful gamers versus liberal minorities who are oppressed.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.760
We're all very liberal over here.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.960
We believe in equal rights, in separation of church and state, in the social safety

17:44.960 --> 17:45.960
net, all that stuff.

17:45.960 --> 17:50.640
But we also believe in objective journalism, in freedom of the press, in the right of people

17:50.640 --> 17:54.760
to know exactly what kind of bullshit corruption is happening in the hobby they are so very

17:54.760 --> 17:55.880
passionate about.

17:55.880 --> 18:00.480
This is about corruption, nothing else, and don't let anybody say otherwise.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.120
People who are currently anti-Gamergate, please rewatch this video.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.080
Examine my evidence for yourself.

18:06.080 --> 18:10.560
You're being used by a tiny clique of devs and journalists who care nothing for you other

18:10.560 --> 18:14.160
than that you're willing to push their narrative for them free of charge.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.200
They don't want you to see the side of them presented in this video.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.360
They don't want you to examine this evidence.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.440
You need proof of this?

18:21.440 --> 18:25.240
Look at the indie devs who have been outright excommunicated from the industry for daring

18:25.240 --> 18:26.560
to ask questions.

18:26.560 --> 18:30.640
Look at Wolf Wozniak who was shouted down for confessing that Zoe Quinn assaulted him.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.160
Who's victim blaming now?

18:32.160 --> 18:34.800
Who's the true peddler of rape culture?

18:34.800 --> 18:38.000
Please look around you and determine who's really fighting for things like truth and

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
equality.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.760
Look at those core group of devs and journalists who use the blanket of social justice to shield

18:43.760 --> 18:48.000
themselves from criticisms of their corruption, who grab minorities and forcibly shove them

18:48.000 --> 18:51.040
in front of the bullets flying at their head.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.340
Your time here is limited.

18:52.340 --> 18:57.040
Whether it be due to the slow eventual death of your bent-ass websites or impending legal

18:57.040 --> 19:01.020
action against you, which I am entirely willing to cooperate with should anybody view this

19:01.020 --> 19:05.720
video and decide to take it on, we won't allow you to ruin our hobby for your own personal

19:05.720 --> 19:06.720
game.

19:06.720 --> 19:07.720
Gamers are not dead.

19:07.720 --> 19:17.240
But with the advent of YouTube personalities, gaming journalism might as well be.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.140
Here's a quick addendum for you.

19:19.140 --> 19:23.560
Since Lordcat did his stream a couple hours before this was recorded, Matthew from the

19:23.560 --> 19:27.440
IGF showed up in the Burgers and Fries channel to try and clear some things up.

19:27.440 --> 19:30.320
He was asked a very simple question.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.360
Was there conflict of interest regarding Fez's win?

19:33.360 --> 19:38.400
It takes him two minutes, and then he says, I haven't really thought about it until this

19:38.400 --> 19:39.400
morning.

19:39.400 --> 19:43.080
In his visit to Burgers and Fries, Matt confirms three other things.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.080
1.

19:44.080 --> 19:48.240
Fez was in fact funded by the group that would later become IndieFund.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.240
2.

19:49.240 --> 19:54.120
Matt confirms the IGF juror tool cannot scan for conflict of interest.

19:54.120 --> 19:57.040
Jurors have to recuse themselves on their own.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.680
It works on an honor system.

19:58.680 --> 19:59.680
3.

19:59.680 --> 20:02.640
Matt denies connection to Fez in 2012.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.200
The Polytron documents seem to go against this.
