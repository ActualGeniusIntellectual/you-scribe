00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
This video is a re-upload from August 2014 with no content changes.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,000
As such, it may not be completely up-to-date.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Any inaccuracies may be explained by its status as a backup.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,500
Completely new Gamergate videos will come in the near future.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
Thank you.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Hey guys, Dev here.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,000
It's been a fun week, hasn't it?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,500
Before I get into the heart of this video, I have a couple short things to say.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Here goes.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,000
One, as usual, Cam really did a lot of the legwork on this project.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But she's had the help of four other people.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
One wishes to remain anonymous, while the other three are RogueStar, PeterNoOne, and Temin.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,500
And a special thanks to LordKat, who did a livestream breaking this news.

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,000
Two, stop fucking harassing people.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,500
Aaron made a long-ass Tumblr post recently, and it basically said people supporting Gamergate

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,500
are just as guilty of harassment as people opposing Gamergate.

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Listen guys, the sex lives of Zoe Quinn and Nathan Grayson and Maya Kramer and Brandon

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,500
Boye and anyone else that comes up is only a matter of public interest if their relationship

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,500
points to some form of collusion or conflict of interest.

20
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Otherwise, it's not part of the topic.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There's no excuse for death threats, or rape threats, or threats of violence to Zoe

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
or Maya or anybody, hell, least of all Sarkeesian because she's barely even connected to this

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
shit.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,500
And yes, I know all too well that they've done it to us too.

25
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,240
I've seen how the opposing side painted Gamergate with the broad brush of white

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,000
cishet male only for NotYourShield to appear.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And I've seen how people opposing Gamergate have desperately tried to prove that NotYourShield

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
is just some giant elaborate ruse.

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I've seen how 4chan has tried to do a legitimately good thing for women in the industry, only

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
to be shouted down by the other side with remarks like,

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Nobody cares about your fucking blood money.

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,000
Hell, Camera Lady herself has been a victim of this.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,500
Even beyond getting her Twitter spam reported and suspended, Anthony Burch lamented that

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,000
there was no real discussion coming out of this about the ethics of infidelity, that

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
no one was interested in really talking to him about the real issues.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But when Camera Lady was willing to have that exact discussion, he blocked her.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,740
It's no surprise that Camera Lady considers herself a feminist, but when she disagreed

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,700
with Brianna Wu on some feminist point of contention, Brianna called Camera a man because

39
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,500
obviously a woman would never disagree with her.

40
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Right?

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500
We all know that the core people, the people at the centre of the anti-Gamergate crowd,

42
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,140
are not interested in equality.

43
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,500
They speak the language of equality, they talk about gender and race a whole lot, but

44
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,320
they're immediately willing to just completely erase the womanhood or the ethnicity or any

45
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,740
other lived experience of a minority person that dares to oppose them.

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,840
To them, minorities are a tool in their toolbox, not actual living, breathing people with their

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,380
own issues and opinions.

48
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,680
But this video isn't really for them.

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,100
This video is for all of those reasonable-minded people that still oppose Gamergate, to those

50
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,780
people who, simply due to the enormity of the discussion, have yet to truly see the

51
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,300
evidence I'm about to present.

52
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
Aaron said,

53
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,320
Gamergate will not win by destroying anybody.

54
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,280
It will win by being rational, cool-headed, and factual.

55
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,520
It will win by converting people.

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,400
So if you stand with Gamergate, please show this to people who don't.

57
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,360
And if you stand against Gamergate, if you're truly interested in equality, if you're

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,920
an indie dev, or whatever, please, watch this video, examine our evidence for yourself,

59
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,400
and keep an open mind.

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
3.

61
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,880
I'd like to issue a formal apology to the development team of Crypt of the Necrodancer.

62
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,500
Slope Oak approached Dave on Reddit, in our PC Gaming, to discuss some of the things said

63
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,060
in the Lego Bus video.

64
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,020
First off, props to him for having the balls to step up and publicly reply to the video.

65
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,620
Ever since that video went up, it's been radio-fucking-silence from all the parties

66
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,500
involved, except a short blurb from Silverstream Media that basically says, we deny everything

67
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,860
that's in the video, also please read these articles on how gamers are dead.

68
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,420
Slope Oak mentioned a number of factual errors in his post, and Dave said he will make sure

69
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,840
they're looked into in time for the next video.

70
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,920
While it's true that we made a factual error regarding C418's involvement in Necrodancer,

71
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,400
and that Slope Oak has had four games in the IGF since 2006, the other claims are hard

72
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,000
to independently verify without being able to talk to anybody else.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,280
And no one's talking.

74
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,240
Of course, at the same time, there's also no reason to disbelieve what Slope Oak has

75
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,440
said on the matter either.

76
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,640
Let me quote a part of Dave's Reddit reply,

77
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,060
I don't think anybody seriously thinks there's a giant round table where the journalists

78
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,080
and indie devs and PR people, all in the cool kids club, sit down and actively plan how

79
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,340
to control gaming while shutting out the little guy.

80
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,460
I think what's happened is that the current iteration of indie gaming has grown too big

81
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,680
to even be considered indie itself.

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,080
When there was all of a dozen indie people in the world, it didn't matter if they were

83
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,180
friends helping each other out.

84
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,540
But it's not a dozen anymore.

85
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,340
It's thousands of people, with real studios now, with actual games getting made and press

86
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,320
favors being exchanged and money changing hands and award shows, but it still acts like

87
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
it's a dozen people.

88
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,160
When it's just two people, they're likely friends, and they'll likely help each other

89
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,060
out as friends are apt to do.

90
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,140
And then it grows into five friends, and then ten friends, and then thousands of people

91
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,900
with significant influence all acting like it's still just a clique.

92
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,820
Indie gaming has grown up, but indie devs have not.

93
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,860
Indie gaming is a real industry now, indie devs have not yet adapted to the larger responsibilities

94
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,740
that come with being in that industry.

95
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,980
The severe disconnect we've seen these past three weeks, how gamers want transparency

96
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,660
in what's going on regarding relationships between devs and journalists and now award

97
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,460
shows, and how indie devs insist it's just their personal life, proves this to be the

98
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,460
case.

99
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,060
This passage cuts to the heart of the matter.

100
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,300
Ultimately, do I think Crypt of the Necrodancer is guilty of anything?

101
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,680
No, I don't.

102
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,340
And even if they were guilty, it's of something very, very minor.

103
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,060
Silverstring is ultimately the party shouldering the majority of the guilt in this specific

104
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,060
situation.

105
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,220
So, I apologize to Slowpoke, and to anybody else who worked on Necrodancer.

106
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,380
It's a really good game.

107
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,420
After seeing how he is publicly willing to respond to criticism, I decided to buy a copy.

108
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,200
And I suggest everybody listening to this go buy one too.

109
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,660
It is legitimately good.

110
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,360
Now, does that mean that the IGF is entirely off the hook, that it's not corrupt or anything?

111
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
Of course not.

112
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,440
And let's discuss how.

113
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,660
Dave and Camera Lady both have talked with lawyers about the content of this video, and

114
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,280
were required to state the following.

115
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,160
In 1971, the US Supreme Court decided in the case New York Times Co. vs. United States

116
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,940
403 U.S. 713 that journalists are allowed to report on the contents of illegally leaked

117
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,320
documents provided that they had nothing to do with the original leaking, and that the

118
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,560
contents of the documents are of legitimate public interest.

119
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,400
Later cases added a few clauses relating to Homeland Security, but this landmark decision

120
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,800
has ultimately become a major cornerstone of the freedom of the press to report on sensitive

121
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,300
materials that are a part of public discourse.

122
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,520
Back at the very beginning of all this, Phil Fish's company, Polytron, was doxxed.

123
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,360
His website was hacked, and all the files stored within were put up to download.

124
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,840
Nobody over here supports the doxxing or hacking of Phil Fish or anybody else.

125
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,480
We do not condone the leaking of Polytron's data.

126
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,440
We will not redistribute Polytron's data.

127
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,920
We will not tell you where to get Polytron's data.

128
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,960
In discussing the legitimate news interest contained within Polytron's data, we will

129
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,800
censor all non-relevant information, and we will not provide uncensored versions.

130
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,640
We have nothing to do with the hacking of Polytron, and we evoke New York Times Co.

131
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:41,200
vs. United States 403 U.S. 713 in our legitimate public discussion of the contents of this

132
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,600
data.

133
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Now then.

134
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Polytron was founded in 2008.

135
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,860
In 2009, Polytron received loans from a number of people in order to help finance the company

136
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,740
and the creation of the game Fez.

137
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,780
On page 19 of the loan contract, there's a table showing who invested, how much they

138
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,340
invested, and what percentage of profit share and voting rights they got in return for their

139
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,340
investment.

140
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,500
Only seven of the people are relevant to this discussion.

141
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,940
Ron Carmel, creator of 2D Boy Nathan Vela, of Capybara Studios

142
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,740
Aaron Asaskin, I think I can't pronounce the name, of App Above

143
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,820
Kelly Santiago, of Ouya, That Game Company, and IndieCade

144
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,060
Jonathan Blow, of EGW Kyle Gabler, of 2D Boy

145
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,840
and Matthew Wagner, of Flashbang Studios

146
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,260
After their successful funding of Fez, these seven developers went on to form a group called

147
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,060
IndieFund, a funding source for independent developers who were looking to encourage the

148
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,940
next wave of game developers.

149
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,700
We can safely consider Fez to be the beta test of the IndieFund project.

150
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,360
In fact, all parties involved seem to consider this to be the case, as a Polytron financial

151
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,120
document shows payments being made back to IndieFund for the original loan.

152
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
That being said, the official IndieFund website does not list Fez under its games funded.

153
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
Why?

154
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,800
Well, to figure that out, we have to examine the events that took place following the initial

155
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,400
investment into Polytron.

156
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,860
In 2011, the IGF had five members of IndieFund and three members of Polytron's own staff

157
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,860
on the finalists panel.

158
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,200
That's eight judges.

159
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,480
However, before the IGF was to accept submissions for that year, Fez creator Phil Fish had to

160
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,440
announce the delay of the game.

161
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,920
Had Phil finished Fez on time, his game would have been a shoe-in to win the grand prize

162
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,460
at IGF that year.

163
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,660
Next year, Fez is entered into the 2012 IGF.

164
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,240
Games to be nominated for the 2012 IGF are considered from September through December

165
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,720
of 2011, while finalists are examined from January through March of 2012.

166
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,000
The finalist judges for the IGF are made public, and are high profiles within gaming.

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,040
They can be indie developers, big name developers, journalists, whatever the chair of the IGF

168
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
decides.

169
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,480
It's still not known how they're selected.

170
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,520
The nominations judges are hundreds of anonymous individuals, all the same type of people as

171
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,720
the finalist judges, and due to the tip-offs from a number of indie devs and individuals

172
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,520
involved in the IGF that have come forward requesting to remain anonymous, we know the

173
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,000
following about the IGF judging process.

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,640
The previous year's public finalist judges commonly returned to be anonymous nominations

175
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
judges the following year.

176
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,340
Judges are assigned games to judge, but can also vote on any other game, even games they're

177
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,400
not assigned to.

178
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,280
For a game to be considered for a finalist position, it needs to have a majority of all

179
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,520
votes cast on it to be positive.

180
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,480
Additionally, we know from the Rotten Cartridge article that games are assigned eight judges,

181
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,040
and that those eight are not even required to play the games they've been given.

182
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,480
So, let's examine what this all means for Fez.

183
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,600
In 2012's IGF, we have eight anonymous nomination judges that have a financial interest in Fez.

184
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:45,840
We know this because those same people were public finalist judges in 2011.

185
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,520
Fez is one of the games in the nomination pool.

186
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,360
Judges have the power to vote for games that they're not assigned to.

187
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,960
Is it possible that eight judges could anonymously ram a game through by pooling their votes?

188
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,160
It seems like it.

189
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,320
Fez potentially began the IGF 2012 nominations process with a plus-eight bias, and there

190
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,600
would be no way for anybody to know.

191
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,180
And hell, the idea that judges can vote on games that they're not assigned to is already

192
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,180
fucked up.

193
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,500
Imagine you're an IGF judge and you have no conflict of interest regarding any of the

194
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
games.

195
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,060
You're scrolling down the list, seeing what catches your eye.

196
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,420
Is it so unreasonable an idea that you would naturally gravitate towards games that already

197
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,460
have a big name, like Fez?

198
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,180
Interestingly enough, the software used by IGF for the anonymous judges was created by

199
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,980
Flashbang Studios, the same studio run by Matthew Wagner, who has a financial interest

200
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,460
in Polytron Corporation.

201
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,300
The IGF's backend was developed by somebody who invested in Fez.

202
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,940
And maybe this is all coincidental, but Fez was allowed through the IGF process twice,

203
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,100
which created a shitstorm in the community.

204
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Remember that?

205
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,860
This has only happened one other time.

206
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,500
Hazard made it through the IGF in 2011, and again in 2012, but at least they had the right

207
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,060
idea to change their name to Anti-Chamber in order to avoid scrutiny.

208
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,380
What makes Hazard, aka Anti-Chamber, interesting is that it is also a game funded by IndieFund.

209
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,180
And maybe it's important to note that the 2012 IGF finalist judge panel had two people

210
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,780
on it also tied to IndieFund and therefore Fez and Anti-Chamber.

211
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:20,020
Andy Schatz, the dev of Monaco, another game funded by IndieFund, and Robin Hunek, an employee

212
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,860
of IndieFund founder, Kelly Santiago's company.

213
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,760
It's also rather suspect that Brandon Boye, whom you all know from the last video, is

214
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,060
close friends with both Phil Fish and IndieFund members, as they have all publicly stated

215
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,540
multiple times on Twitter.

216
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,700
But what's really suspect to me is this timeline of events.

217
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,380
IGF 2012 opens.

218
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,820
Shortly after the vetting of nominees begins, Phil Fish delays the launch of Fez to April

219
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,340
2012, mere weeks after IGF 2012 is to announce its winners.

220
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,620
Fez then wins IGF awards.

221
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,020
Why is this suspect?

222
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,620
Well, when you inspect the loan agreement from earlier, on page 2, article 6, it states

223
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,540
Polytron shall pay the lenders of the share of gross revenues from the Xbox Live Arcade

224
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:06,220
version of games sold prior to the 365th day after that version's release date.

225
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,020
Furthermore, Polytron shall pay lenders the share of the gross revenues from the PC version

226
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,260
of the games sold prior to the 183rd day after the version's release date.

227
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,260
What does this mean?

228
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,580
Well, the people who lended money to Phil Fish received the biggest payout the first

229
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:29,460
365 days Fez is on sale on the XBLA, and the first 183 days Fez is on sale on the PC.

230
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,580
And when would you want to release the game to maximize the profits and payouts?

231
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,940
Right after your game has won a major award and received tons of great press, of course.

232
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:43,780
Keep in mind, Phil Fish delayed Fez shortly after the vetting of nominees for IGF 2012

233
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,740
began, and he delayed it to launch right after he would later win IGF awards.

234
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:54,460
Is it possible that Phil Fish knew he was going to win IGF 2012 back in September of

235
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,460
2011?

236
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,140
Now, these are all very interesting questions that the IGF needs to answer.

237
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,580
But regarding just how many pies the indie fund people have stuck their fingers into,

238
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,980
there's something a lot more sinister than just questions.

239
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,840
And that has to do with IndieCade.

240
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,200
You all remember IndieCade, right?

241
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,420
That organization that gave Zoe Quinn's Depression Quest an award while two of its chairs were

242
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,820
her sexual or romantic partners, Robin Arnott and Maya Kramer?

243
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,800
Well, it goes a lot further than that.

244
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,960
We intend to show that IndieCade does not value gaming, integrity, or fairness, only

245
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,960
its own wallet.

246
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,680
Recall, in 2009, Kelly Santiago invested money in Polytrum.

247
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,520
This investment gave her voting rates within the company and a percentage of Fez's profits.

248
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,000
In 2011, Kelly Santiago became the chair of the awards jury at IndieCade.

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,680
Interestingly, 2011 was the year in which Fez brought home two awards, Disciplinary

250
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:52,480
Excellence in Story and World Design, and General Excellence by Grand Jury.

251
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,320
IndieCade's own rules state that the jury that selects these awards is made up of 100

252
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:02,000
anonymous individuals, but that the jury's awards chair works with each of the jurors

253
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,760
to cast their vote.

254
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Read it again.

255
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,520
Read it again.

256
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Kelly Santiago, chair of the IC's awards jury, having a direct financial interest in Fez,

257
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,560
works with the jurors judging Fez to determine their vote in a festival that Fez won two

258
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
awards.

259
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,480
With her hands, in every vote cast, and with her having money in Fez, is it any wonder

260
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,760
that Fez won?

261
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,520
If this is true, and I believe it is, IndieCade is guilty of siphoning individual funds through

262
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,460
ticket sales and sponsorship money as prize money for Fez's awards, which is then recycled

263
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,720
back into the pockets of those investors.

264
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,920
Phil Fish gets a fat payday from his pals, who also get a cut due to their loan agreement,

265
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,960
and it all comes out of the pockets of the people who attend and sponsor IndieCade.

266
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,040
Ultimately, IndieFund appears to be guilty of manipulating events at both IndieCade and

267
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,880
the IGF in order to maximize their profit margins on Fez, to the detriment of all indie

268
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,600
developers that enter those events, as well as the gaming public.

269
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,760
This collusion between IndieFund, the IGF, and IndieCade has lined the pockets of all

270
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,960
involved while treating the other indie entrants to their contests with extreme disrespect.

271
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,080
As well as everyone who bought Fez, who thought Fez won its awards on merit alone, anyone

272
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,000
who wrote an article on Fez, the IGF, or IndieCade, and all gamers anywhere who truly

273
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,960
believe that the indie gaming scene would be a safe haven for all the corrupt bullshit

274
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,000
that plagues AAA gaming, they have collectively spat in the faces of everyone who look up

275
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,080
to them, and I don't mean just by releasing ten shitty articles all within the course

276
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,480
of a day decrying the death of the gamer.

277
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,640
If Fez receives such preferential treatment thanks to IndieFund, what other games have

278
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,080
also gotten a boost?

279
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,040
Did other IndieFund backed games such as Monaco, Antichamber, Dear Esther, and Zoe

280
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,000
Quinn's own Framed also receive special treatment in the awards that they won due to their backers'

281
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,480
hands in the cookie jar?

282
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,520
What other companies does Kelly Santiago have a vested financial interest in?

283
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,400
Why aren't any of these interests disclosed to the public, or even the developers that

284
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,840
apply to these events?

285
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,760
Of the journalists that covered this, how many of them were incentivized by IndieFund

286
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,520
to cover these games positively?

287
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,520
When Polytron was hacked, nobody really looked too deeply into it.

288
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,440
There was a gigantic shitstorm on V in Reddit, a lot of laughs were had, and then it was

289
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
forgotten.

290
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,000
Nobody, including us, really think to look too deeply into it until we discovered the

291
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,320
trail of crumbs leading back to the IGF in the last video.

292
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,200
People who are currently invested in Gamergate, don't let anybody fool you.

293
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,580
This is not about misogyny.

294
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,900
We decry misogyny at every turn.

295
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,040
This is not a matter of conservative, hateful gamers versus liberal minorities who are oppressed.

296
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,760
We're all very liberal over here.

297
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,960
We believe in equal rights, in separation of church and state, in the social safety

298
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,960
net, all that stuff.

299
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,640
But we also believe in objective journalism, in freedom of the press, in the right of people

300
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,760
to know exactly what kind of bullshit corruption is happening in the hobby they are so very

301
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,880
passionate about.

302
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,480
This is about corruption, nothing else, and don't let anybody say otherwise.

303
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,120
People who are currently anti-Gamergate, please rewatch this video.

304
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,080
Examine my evidence for yourself.

305
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,560
You're being used by a tiny clique of devs and journalists who care nothing for you other

306
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,160
than that you're willing to push their narrative for them free of charge.

307
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,200
They don't want you to see the side of them presented in this video.

308
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,360
They don't want you to examine this evidence.

309
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,440
You need proof of this?

310
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,240
Look at the indie devs who have been outright excommunicated from the industry for daring

311
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,560
to ask questions.

312
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,640
Look at Wolf Wozniak who was shouted down for confessing that Zoe Quinn assaulted him.

313
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,160
Who's victim blaming now?

314
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,800
Who's the true peddler of rape culture?

315
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,000
Please look around you and determine who's really fighting for things like truth and

316
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
equality.

317
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,760
Look at those core group of devs and journalists who use the blanket of social justice to shield

318
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,000
themselves from criticisms of their corruption, who grab minorities and forcibly shove them

319
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,040
in front of the bullets flying at their head.

320
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,340
Your time here is limited.

321
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,040
Whether it be due to the slow eventual death of your bent-ass websites or impending legal

322
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,020
action against you, which I am entirely willing to cooperate with should anybody view this

323
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,720

game.

325
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
Gamers are not dead.

326
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:17,240
But with the advent of YouTube personalities, gaming journalism might as well be.

327
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,140
Here's a quick addendum for you.

328
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,560
Since Lordcat did his stream a couple hours before this was recorded, Matthew from the

329
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,440
IGF showed up in the Burgers and Fries channel to try and clear some things up.

330
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,320
He was asked a very simple question.

331
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,360
Was there conflict of interest regarding Fez's win?

332
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,400
It takes him two minutes, and then he says, I haven't really thought about it until this

333
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
morning.

334
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,080
In his visit to Burgers and Fries, Matt confirms three other things.

335
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
1.

336
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,240
Fez was in fact funded by the group that would later become IndieFund.

337
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
2.

338
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,120
Matt confirms the IGF juror tool cannot scan for conflict of interest.

339
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,040
Jurors have to recuse themselves on their own.

340
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,680
It works on an honor system.

341
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
3.

342
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,640
Matt denies connection to Fez in 2012.

343
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,200
The Polytron documents seem to go against this.
