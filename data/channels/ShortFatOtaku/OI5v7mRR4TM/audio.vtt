00:00.000 --> 00:09.080
During the most recent weekly sip, I read this astonishing article,

00:09.080 --> 00:15.080
Non-Binary Romeo and Juliet set in Nazi Germany apologizes for omitting Jews from the casting

00:15.080 --> 00:20.160
call. A production of Romeo and Juliet for non-binary performers, with Juliet reimagined

00:20.160 --> 00:25.720
as a persecuted Jew and Romeo as a member of the Hitler Youth, has become embroiled over its failure

00:25.760 --> 00:31.000
to include Jewish people in a casting call. The company advertised for non-binary artists and

00:31.000 --> 00:36.520
or those of global majority, Black or Asian heritage to join the cast. The call did not

00:36.520 --> 00:41.480
include any request for Jewish performers to join the cast of the production, set in the Third Reich,

00:41.480 --> 00:46.040
and the company has publicly apologized for the omission. Please accept our profound apologies

00:46.040 --> 00:49.800
for neglecting to mention the performers of Jewish background or preferred for the Capulets.

00:49.800 --> 00:54.200
This was the initial intention. The director is Jewish and our intention has always been to

00:54.200 --> 00:58.920
include this casting preference. My God, doesn't that sound like an amazing show? I'd love to go

00:58.920 --> 01:04.520
see that nonsense. Romeo as a non-binary member of the Hitler Youth, Juliet's probably a Black

01:04.520 --> 01:10.080
Jewish lesbian in a wheelchair, white-facing as Anne Frank. Incredible. But my curiosity was

01:10.080 --> 01:15.080
drawn to one specific passage. One word, actually. The company advertised for non-binary artists and

01:15.080 --> 01:20.080
or those of global majority, Black or Asian heritage. Global majority? This is the first

01:20.080 --> 01:23.600
I'd ever heard the term, but it's pretty obvious what it means, right? In white majority countries,

01:23.640 --> 01:28.040
Black people or Asian people are a racial minority, and we use that term minority to refer

01:28.040 --> 01:32.360
to them. But on a global scale, there's clearly more Black and Asian people than there are white

01:32.360 --> 01:36.680
people, making them the global majority. It's a pretty intuitive term, but where did it come from?

01:36.680 --> 01:41.240
And why is there a switch from language about minorities to the majority? When people think

01:41.240 --> 01:46.720
about minorities, they often think in broad terms left-wing politics. Your average progressive draws

01:46.720 --> 01:51.200
moral legitimacy by appealing to the rights of or the protection of various minority groups,

01:51.200 --> 01:55.400
racial or ethnic minorities, sexual or gender minorities, religious minorities,

01:55.400 --> 01:59.440
people with various disabilities, even if they're wildly different, are often called upon as if

01:59.440 --> 02:03.960
they're a minority. The idea is that the majority culture is always going to be inherently oppressive

02:03.960 --> 02:08.600
towards these minorities. An obvious example is in a majority Christian society, the state,

02:08.600 --> 02:13.160
the social institutions, and the general culture is going to broadly be pro-Christian and may

02:13.160 --> 02:16.960
actively discriminate against or suppress non-Christians, maybe with state force,

02:16.960 --> 02:20.400
maybe with differing rules for interacting with social institutions, maybe with cultural

02:20.400 --> 02:24.680
exclusion. But even if that society did not actually do any of those things, there's always

02:24.680 --> 02:29.760
going to be a base level of background radiation style discrimination. The best example I can think

02:29.760 --> 02:34.680
of right now is from another Weekly Sip article, where that Muslim mother decried society being so

02:34.680 --> 02:38.560
Christmas-oriented during December and how hard it was to shield her children from the influence

02:38.560 --> 02:42.720
of the overarching culture she was living in in the West. From her point of view, even though

02:42.720 --> 02:46.680
nobody's actually oppressing her, nobody's excluding her from Christmas, and nobody's

02:46.680 --> 02:50.040
preventing her from opting out of Christmas and celebrating her own holidays, the fact that she

02:50.080 --> 02:54.320
lives in a culture where Christmas is celebrated means she feels othered every time she steps

02:54.320 --> 02:58.480
outside. In effect, from her point of view, the normal, polite goings-on of a culture she lives

02:58.480 --> 03:03.080
in but is not part of feels exclusionary to her. And a Christian who happened to be in the Middle

03:03.080 --> 03:07.640
East during Ramadan or something would likely feel the same way. Even if he was left alone to

03:07.640 --> 03:12.120
not participate, there would still be that feeling of being a stranger in a strange land. The

03:12.120 --> 03:16.680
implication here is that a progressive society should understand that any majority is always

03:16.680 --> 03:20.440
going to be inherently oppressive towards minorities, no matter what people do, and

03:20.440 --> 03:24.960
therefore in order to be good and moral, we should give their needs extra consideration. This is the

03:24.960 --> 03:29.080
foundation for programs like affirmative action in schools or in hiring practices, or public

03:29.080 --> 03:32.400
representation in entertainment, or providing them a special seat in government or corporate

03:32.400 --> 03:36.120
functions to ensure that their unique viewpoint has a chance to be heard and considered by the

03:36.120 --> 03:40.760
majority. Regardless of whether any of this is good or bad, factual or fake, it doesn't matter.

03:40.760 --> 03:45.000
This is what we think of when we think of the word minority in the Western world. And so,

03:45.000 --> 03:48.840
the question is, why is the left slowly giving up that entire school of thought,

03:48.840 --> 03:54.720
this entire foundation of moral legitimacy by switching rhetoric over from minorities to the

03:54.720 --> 03:59.000
global majority? Well, let's consider a few ideas. Firstly, it seems to be the case that

03:59.000 --> 04:03.280
progressives only stand up for certain types of minorities. And no, I'm not talking about them

04:03.280 --> 04:07.480
suddenly being racist towards black conservatives or shitting on right-leaning trans people,

04:07.480 --> 04:11.760
though that obviously does happen. The progs love to revoke the minority card of any individual

04:11.760 --> 04:15.720
person who is actually a minority but doesn't align with their politics. And while that's

04:15.720 --> 04:19.040
pretty funny and leads to some pretty cringe moments, that's not what I'm referring to here.

04:19.040 --> 04:22.920
Ayn Rand, being a darling of the libertarians, though she disliked the libertarian movement

04:22.920 --> 04:27.480
herself, is hated by progressives to the point that she doesn't count as reading a female author

04:27.480 --> 04:32.000
in their view. Another funny example of evoking the minority card. But like every other great

04:32.000 --> 04:36.800
writer of history, she has at least one rock-solid irrefutable point. And it's encapsulated in this

04:36.800 --> 04:41.320
quote, the smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights

04:41.400 --> 04:45.680
cannot claim to be the defenders of minorities. This seems to be the truth, as well as a shortcut

04:45.680 --> 04:49.640
to the natural endpoint of intersectional theory. The intersectionalists say that while you may be

04:49.640 --> 04:54.040
oppressed for being black and you may be oppressed for being gay in a different way, if you're black

04:54.040 --> 04:58.480
and gay, the two separate forms of oppression bolster each other, with each way you are

04:58.480 --> 05:03.120
oppressed or privileged, forming the bars and the gaps of a cage which imprisons you. The natural end

05:03.120 --> 05:07.240
result of this idea is that every single individual is oppressed in a slightly different way, due to

05:07.240 --> 05:10.440
everybody having slightly different life experiences, and that each person's oppression

05:10.520 --> 05:15.000
is ultimately unique. Rand cuts through all the necessary intersectional calculations of how

05:15.000 --> 05:18.760
you're a minority in one way and a majority in the other, to arrive at the inevitable endpoint.

05:18.760 --> 05:23.400
That the individual is the smallest minority. A minority of one person weighed against the

05:23.400 --> 05:28.800
majority that is the rest of the human race. And yet, leftists don't value individuals. They reject

05:28.800 --> 05:33.960
individualism as a bourgeois capitalist mechanism that keeps communities and classes down. Class

05:33.960 --> 05:38.720
consciousness for the socialist is the rejection of that individualistic idea and instead engaging

05:38.720 --> 05:43.440
in solidarity with your social class. Race consciousness for, say, the black activist in

05:43.440 --> 05:48.400
America works the same way, to the point that individualism is now often branded as a component

05:48.400 --> 05:52.680
of white supremacy. Meanwhile, progressives aren't fond of individualism either, with a heavy

05:52.680 --> 05:57.120
emphasis on social responsibility and the welfare state overpowering any individualist concerns.

05:57.120 --> 06:01.280
The individual isn't the only minority that leftists don't advocate for. There's a joke

06:01.280 --> 06:05.640
floating around that the rich are a minority that never sees any advocacy done for them by social

06:05.640 --> 06:09.960
justice groups. And hey, you can't deny that. They're literally called the 1%. That's clearly

06:09.960 --> 06:14.400
a minority. The obvious reply to this position is that even though the 1% are a minority,

06:14.400 --> 06:18.920
they don't need activism due to their sheer material wealth. And this applies to politicians,

06:18.920 --> 06:23.320
to presidents, to kings and nobility too. These are all minorities in society, but they wield

06:23.320 --> 06:28.080
wealth and power and sometimes both, so they don't need advocates. The inverse logic also

06:28.080 --> 06:32.280
applies. Consider women. When I was back in university taking that Intro to Gender Studies

06:32.520 --> 06:36.320
class, women was considered a minority. The professor explained, even though women aren't

06:36.320 --> 06:41.000
actually a minority, there are in fact more women than men on the planet. Women have minority status

06:41.000 --> 06:45.160
in the progressive hierarchy because they're oppressed. Again, it's marginalization that

06:45.160 --> 06:49.800
grants moral legitimacy, not actually being a member of a class with fewer numbers. Back in

06:49.800 --> 06:54.780
the late 2000s, a majority population could be a minority if they were oppressed. So what's

06:54.780 --> 06:59.240
actually happening here is that when a progressive calls upon the moral legitimacy of the minority,

06:59.240 --> 07:03.560
it's not actually being a member of a minority class that generates that moral legitimacy. It's

07:03.560 --> 07:08.480
being an outsider. In a majority white society, both a white king and a black peasant are,

07:08.480 --> 07:12.280
in their own way, a minority. But the king is at the center of the society while the black

07:12.280 --> 07:16.160
peasant is on the margins. Hence the phrase marginalization. What matters in the Prague

07:16.160 --> 07:20.400
estimation isn't that you're a minority, but it's that you're marginalized. This is how they can

07:20.400 --> 07:24.920
justify excluding Asians from affirmative action schemes because they might be a minority, but

07:24.920 --> 07:28.960
they're not marginalized in their view. Majority populations having most of the wealth and power

07:29.000 --> 07:33.240
in a given society don't need to be protected in the same way that minority ones do. Until,

07:33.240 --> 07:37.240
of course, the Prague suddenly do want to claim that status rhetorically through the use of the

07:37.240 --> 07:40.720
phrase global majority. And so far I've been describing what's been going on here, but we

07:40.720 --> 07:45.580
still haven't gotten to why the slow switch between protect minorities to protect the global

07:45.580 --> 07:50.440
majority is taking place. Let's talk about the source of political authority. All post-enlightenment

07:50.440 --> 07:54.760
philosophies, liberalism, socialism, and fascism, claim to draw their political authority from the

07:54.760 --> 07:59.160
bottom up. Liberals talk about representative democracy, the voter, the citizen, and it's

07:59.160 --> 08:03.160
through the polity that legitimate political power springs. Socialists talk about production,

08:03.160 --> 08:07.720
the worker, the proletariat. To them, those who do all the productive labor of society are the

08:07.720 --> 08:12.040
source of legitimate political power. Fascists talk about ethnicity, the blood, the people. To

08:12.040 --> 08:16.560
them, legitimate political power comes from biological and cultural solidarity. All three

08:16.560 --> 08:21.360
of these philosophies are, in some way, majoritarian. They appeal to the vast majority

08:21.360 --> 08:25.400
of people under their rule for their legitimacy, and they claim to be implementing the will of

08:25.400 --> 08:30.640
that majority. But pre-enlightenment philosophies, like monarchy, for example, they're minoritarian.

08:30.640 --> 08:34.720
They don't care about gaining legitimacy from the citizen, or the worker, or the people. They

08:34.720 --> 08:39.280
don't answer to the majority. The divine right of kings was not simply a top-down imposition of

08:39.280 --> 08:42.800
political power, though it was certainly that. But it was also an admission that the monarch's

08:42.800 --> 08:47.520
place in the hierarchy was below God. That even as they drew their political legitimacy from God,

08:47.560 --> 08:51.840
they also had to submit to him. In secular terms, the minoritarian view is that a good leader does

08:51.840 --> 08:56.040
not simply bend to the whims of the majority of those he rules over, because those whims might be

08:56.040 --> 09:00.480
retarded. Instead, his job is to implement a political ideal as imperfectly as he can,

09:00.480 --> 09:04.760
because he's still only just a human, and not be swayed by the sort-sighted, selfish politics

09:04.760 --> 09:08.960
of the day. The reason that modern liberal democracy is unique is because it attempts to

09:08.960 --> 09:14.120
blend both types of legitimacy. Constitutional monarchies, like the UK, Canada, Australia,

09:14.120 --> 09:18.880
Japan, feature both bottom-up and top-down characteristics, with representative democracy

09:18.880 --> 09:22.880
speaking for the commoners, and a monarch that represents an ideal that those societies should

09:22.880 --> 09:27.080
be united in striving towards, despite their political differences. Meanwhile, constitutional

09:27.080 --> 09:31.360
republics like America or India have in the position of the ideal, not a monarch, but a

09:31.360 --> 09:36.000
constitution. It nonetheless takes on a similar function, to outline a political ideal that,

09:36.000 --> 09:40.480
regardless of the whims of the day, cannot be violated so easily. And yes, because I'm a

09:40.480 --> 09:44.760
liberal centrist cuck, I think striking this balance is the best way to do it. A society

09:44.760 --> 09:49.280
which derives political legitimacy in a purely top-down manner is primed for terrible abuses

09:49.280 --> 09:53.000
of power, where the motivations and goals of rulers fail to take into account the ruled,

09:53.000 --> 09:58.040
or worse yet, actively move against the ruled's interests. What rightoids, especially monarchist

09:58.040 --> 10:02.760
rightoids in Europe, often fail to grasp is that even for an enlightened, benevolent philosopher

10:02.760 --> 10:07.120
king, there needs to be a plebeian check on his power, because there's no reason to assume his

10:07.120 --> 10:11.440
children will be just as good as him. Meanwhile, a society which derives political legitimacy in a

10:11.440 --> 10:16.000
purely bottom-up manner immediately falls to the tyranny of the majority, where those who are

10:16.000 --> 10:20.800
different are punished for it, simply because they are different. But leftoids, especially anarchists

10:20.800 --> 10:25.320
and direct democracy socialists, often fail to grasp is that ten men gang-raping a woman,

10:25.320 --> 10:31.320
or ten whites lynching a black man, is a democratic act, and that minorities and individuals do need

10:31.320 --> 10:36.840
to be protected from the power of majority rule. That is why a liberal capitalist democratic system

10:36.880 --> 10:41.800
values the vote, but does not hold it as the ultimate value. It's why the people still

10:41.800 --> 10:46.560
ultimately decide, but there are limits on that power. During the Russian revolutionary period,

10:46.560 --> 10:51.160
the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was split into two factions. Firstly, the Mensheviks,

10:51.160 --> 10:55.760
a Russian word meaning one of the minority, headed by Julius Martov. And secondly, the Bolsheviks,

10:55.760 --> 10:59.880
a Russian word meaning one of the majority, headed by Vladimir Lenin. The names of these

10:59.880 --> 11:04.600
groups didn't accurately describe their popularity. The five-party congresses before the party was

11:04.600 --> 11:08.720
dissolved in 1918 showed the Bolsheviks winning two majorities, the Mensheviks winning two,

11:08.720 --> 11:12.680
and one with no clear winner due to multiple other factions. But nonetheless, their names

11:12.680 --> 11:17.320
did describe how they each viewed political power. Martov, as the head of the Mensheviks,

11:17.320 --> 11:22.000
was described in the book A People's Tragedy as being too good an intellectual to be a successful

11:22.000 --> 11:26.200
politician, that he was held back from making extremist moves due to his integrity, and he

11:26.200 --> 11:29.880
chose his allies by the coherence of their worldview rather than the practical situation

11:29.880 --> 11:33.800
on the ground. He was applauded for his high-minded approach, but he was also considered indecisive

11:34.000 --> 11:38.680
during times of crisis, earning the Mensheviks the nickname of the Sofs. Lenin, as head of the

11:38.680 --> 11:43.640
Bolsheviks, was described in the book The Life of Lenin as having an iron will, self-enslaving

11:43.640 --> 11:48.040
self-discipline, scorn for his opponents and for obstacles, the cold determination of a zealot,

11:48.040 --> 11:52.000
the drive of a fanatic, and the ability to convince or browbeat weaker persons by his

11:52.000 --> 11:56.040
singleness of purpose, imposing intensity, impersonal approach, personal sacrifice,

11:56.040 --> 12:00.400
political astuteness, and the complete conviction of the possession of the absolute truth. In his

12:00.400 --> 12:05.440
morality, he was a ruthless utilitarian, saying simply, does a certain action advance or hinder

12:05.440 --> 12:10.000
the cause of the revolution? Lenin and Martov were close friends. Even after the Bolsheviks

12:10.000 --> 12:13.920
took total control of Russia, outlawed the Mensheviks, and Martov was exiled to Europe,

12:13.920 --> 12:17.960
Lenin still thought of him as a friend. And on his deathbed, Lenin lamented that Martov,

12:17.960 --> 12:23.000
somewhere else in the world, was also reported to be on his own deathbed. Two very different men,

12:23.000 --> 12:27.560
both with their own strengths and weaknesses. Martov's intelligence and morals were admirable

12:27.560 --> 12:31.920
qualities, but his lack of political experience left him open to Lenin's ruthlessness and

12:31.920 --> 12:36.380
amorality. And just in case that story makes you think, look, the guy who stuck to his principles

12:36.380 --> 12:40.840
got backstabbed and the guy who did not won. Clearly abandoning your morality in the pursuit

12:40.840 --> 12:45.640
of power is good. Look at what Lenin's ruthlessness and amorality did to Russia afterward.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.800
This is just my personal opinion here. I believe that the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks were not

12:49.800 --> 12:53.920
named after literally being the majority or the minority of the socialist movement in Russia,

12:54.040 --> 12:58.800
but instead because the rank and file of those two movements did actually come to reflect the

12:58.800 --> 13:03.640
behaviors of their two leaders. The majority is an oppressive force. The left is correct when they

13:03.640 --> 13:08.400
point this out. Therefore, it's no surprise that when leftists are in the minority, they appeal to

13:08.400 --> 13:13.280
liberal principles. The idea that the center of society should not simply do what it will to those

13:13.280 --> 13:17.640
in the margins, but actually treat them with some decency. But when they become the majority,

13:17.640 --> 13:22.240
they don't appeal to that liberal principle anymore. And they take on the full moral weight

13:22.280 --> 13:27.000
of that oppressive majority to crush their opponents in the name of doing what the majority

13:27.000 --> 13:31.840
wants. And because liberal institutions have limits on democratic power, leftists always

13:31.840 --> 13:35.600
tried to dismantle those limits in the name of liberating the majority. You know that Frank

13:35.600 --> 13:39.520
Herbert quote, when I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your

13:39.520 --> 13:43.400
principles. But when I'm stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that's according to my

13:43.400 --> 13:48.240
principles. That's particularly relevant here. The enemies of liberalism view liberal values

13:48.240 --> 13:52.920
like free speech, free association, capitalism and property, equality before the law, not as

13:52.920 --> 13:57.140
principles to be upheld for all, but to be used and abused while they're on the margins and to

13:57.140 --> 14:01.600
be dismantled once they take power. When a leftist appeals to the minority, it's a signal that they

14:01.600 --> 14:06.560
view themselves on the margins. They're weak and downtrodden and deserve our special consideration

14:06.560 --> 14:10.920
beyond liberal freedoms and equality before the law. But when a leftist begins to say we're the

14:10.920 --> 14:16.320
majority instead, like the slow shift to global minority, or like the use of the term Bolshevik,

14:16.360 --> 14:21.240
it's a signal that they view themselves as taking power, that now their moral legitimacy comes from

14:21.240 --> 14:25.480
representing most people, not from being an outsider, and that therefore they should be

14:25.480 --> 14:30.200
listened to over any sort of pesky minority, like anybody who happens to disagree with them. And to

14:30.200 --> 14:34.160
me, that's a pretty scary shift. If you think I'm speaking out of my ass, you should read this paper

14:34.160 --> 14:38.840
written by the person who coined the term global majority in the first place on how she intended

14:38.840 --> 14:44.520
for it to be used a UK intellectual by the name of Rosemary Campbell Stevens. Global majority is a

14:44.560 --> 14:49.120
collective term that first and foremost speaks to and encourages those so called to think of

14:49.120 --> 14:53.480
themselves as belonging to the global majority. It refers to people who are black, Asian, brown,

14:53.480 --> 14:58.840
dual heritage, indigenous to the global south, and or have been racialized as ethnic minorities.

14:58.840 --> 15:03.600
Globally, these groups currently represent approximately 80% of the world's population,

15:03.600 --> 15:07.760
making them the global majority. Understanding that singular truth may shift the dial,

15:07.760 --> 15:12.800
it certainly should permanently disrupt and relocate the conversation. Applying the term

15:12.800 --> 15:18.560
global majority to groups that are routinely either not seen or marginalized not only bring

15:18.560 --> 15:23.720
in people from the margins, but brings into focus what may create marginalization, including the

15:23.720 --> 15:28.520
historical and current role of systemic racism, white privilege, and the power dynamics therein.

15:28.520 --> 15:33.800
The white elite act globally, their power has historically resided in large part in the fact

15:33.800 --> 15:38.440
that 1% of the world's population holds approximately 44% of the world's wealth.

15:38.440 --> 15:42.840
They are globally connected, operate collectively in their mutually exclusive interest,

15:42.840 --> 15:47.200
wielding power accordingly through transnational corporations, organizations, financial

15:47.200 --> 15:51.680
institutions, governments, and multinationals. Connected systems, economic, business, political,

15:51.680 --> 15:56.280
educational, health, all work with synchronized mindsets focused on maintaining the status quo,

15:56.280 --> 16:01.080
while simultaneously sowing and fueling discord elsewhere. The elite minority are aided and

16:01.080 --> 16:05.480
abetted across the globe by those who are not white, but who want desperately to appropriate

16:05.480 --> 16:10.560
whiteness. The so-called third world, the occupied territory created for the global majority,

16:10.560 --> 16:15.240
is needed to maintain the concentration, flow, and control of resources, wealth,

16:15.240 --> 16:20.320
and power into the hands of the few in the first world. Poor whites are the basic members of the

16:20.320 --> 16:25.080
white club, with minimal benefits. They are there to make up numbers when required, be the deflectors

16:25.080 --> 16:29.000
or cannon fodder, and essentially act as the buffer between the white elite and those they

16:29.000 --> 16:33.280
have othered. The non-white allies are as intentional about joining the club as the

16:33.280 --> 16:36.520
elites are about maintaining the status quo and keeping them firmly at arm's length.

16:36.520 --> 16:40.720
Of course, you could never speak like this about any other race, whether true or false.

16:40.720 --> 16:44.040
Kanye is learning that the hard way right now. And it doesn't even matter that a lot of the

16:44.040 --> 16:48.640
stuff in here is false. Like the idea that the world's elite doesn't contain a lot of non-white

16:48.640 --> 16:52.920
people. Like non-white mega-rich people or the ruling elite of non-white countries don't exist

16:52.920 --> 16:57.000
or something. Because the underlying logic is clear. The progressive movement is winning. Things

16:57.000 --> 17:02.240
are changing. It's now time to stop deriving moral legitimacy from being a minority, an other,

17:02.280 --> 17:07.280
a victim, those in the margins. Now is the time to seize the moral legitimacy of the center. To

17:07.280 --> 17:11.960
take the reins of power and oppress the way that we imagine our ancestors were oppressed. To reject

17:11.960 --> 17:16.960
liberal colorblindness and right a generational wrong. It is terrifying that this is how the

17:16.960 --> 17:21.760
people who actually follow critical race theory think. Yes, some of what Europeans did to

17:21.760 --> 17:26.240
non-Europeans during the age of colonization was brutal, obviously. But we don't live in that age

17:26.240 --> 17:31.160
anymore. We've learned from those mistakes. And yet, some people still want revenge for a crime,

17:31.200 --> 17:35.800
nobody alive in the West committed, and none of them ever actually experienced. All you have to

17:35.800 --> 17:40.720
do is hop on Twitter and see an infinite number of progs say that this is a revenge for colonization.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.960
To understand that they've abandoned the liberal principles we were meant to live by, preferring a

17:44.960 --> 17:50.040
fucking race war instead. Anybody who thinks like this is, in my opinion, morally reprehensible. And,

17:50.040 --> 17:56.000
as the phrase global majority becomes more popular over the next decade, expect a lot of people to go

17:56.000 --> 17:57.640
way more mask off.
