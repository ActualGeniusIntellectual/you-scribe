0	9080	During the most recent weekly sip, I read this astonishing article,
9080	15080	Non-Binary Romeo and Juliet set in Nazi Germany apologizes for omitting Jews from the casting
15080	20160	call. A production of Romeo and Juliet for non-binary performers, with Juliet reimagined
20160	25720	as a persecuted Jew and Romeo as a member of the Hitler Youth, has become embroiled over its failure
25760	31000	to include Jewish people in a casting call. The company advertised for non-binary artists and
31000	36520	or those of global majority, Black or Asian heritage to join the cast. The call did not
36520	41480	include any request for Jewish performers to join the cast of the production, set in the Third Reich,
41480	46040	and the company has publicly apologized for the omission. Please accept our profound apologies
46040	49800	for neglecting to mention the performers of Jewish background or preferred for the Capulets.
49800	54200	This was the initial intention. The director is Jewish and our intention has always been to
54200	58920	include this casting preference. My God, doesn't that sound like an amazing show? I'd love to go
58920	64520	see that nonsense. Romeo as a non-binary member of the Hitler Youth, Juliet's probably a Black
64520	70080	Jewish lesbian in a wheelchair, white-facing as Anne Frank. Incredible. But my curiosity was
70080	75080	drawn to one specific passage. One word, actually. The company advertised for non-binary artists and
75080	80080	or those of global majority, Black or Asian heritage. Global majority? This is the first
80080	83600	I'd ever heard the term, but it's pretty obvious what it means, right? In white majority countries,
83640	88040	Black people or Asian people are a racial minority, and we use that term minority to refer
88040	92360	to them. But on a global scale, there's clearly more Black and Asian people than there are white
92360	96680	people, making them the global majority. It's a pretty intuitive term, but where did it come from?
96680	101240	And why is there a switch from language about minorities to the majority? When people think
101240	106720	about minorities, they often think in broad terms left-wing politics. Your average progressive draws
106720	111200	moral legitimacy by appealing to the rights of or the protection of various minority groups,
111200	115400	racial or ethnic minorities, sexual or gender minorities, religious minorities,
115400	119440	people with various disabilities, even if they're wildly different, are often called upon as if
119440	123960	they're a minority. The idea is that the majority culture is always going to be inherently oppressive
123960	128600	towards these minorities. An obvious example is in a majority Christian society, the state,
128600	133160	the social institutions, and the general culture is going to broadly be pro-Christian and may
133160	136960	actively discriminate against or suppress non-Christians, maybe with state force,
136960	140400	maybe with differing rules for interacting with social institutions, maybe with cultural
140400	144680	exclusion. But even if that society did not actually do any of those things, there's always
144680	149760	going to be a base level of background radiation style discrimination. The best example I can think
149760	154680	of right now is from another Weekly Sip article, where that Muslim mother decried society being so
154680	158560	Christmas-oriented during December and how hard it was to shield her children from the influence
158560	162720	of the overarching culture she was living in in the West. From her point of view, even though
162720	166680	nobody's actually oppressing her, nobody's excluding her from Christmas, and nobody's
166680	170040	preventing her from opting out of Christmas and celebrating her own holidays, the fact that she
170080	174320	lives in a culture where Christmas is celebrated means she feels othered every time she steps
174320	178480	outside. In effect, from her point of view, the normal, polite goings-on of a culture she lives
178480	183080	in but is not part of feels exclusionary to her. And a Christian who happened to be in the Middle
183080	187640	East during Ramadan or something would likely feel the same way. Even if he was left alone to
187640	192120	not participate, there would still be that feeling of being a stranger in a strange land. The
192120	196680	implication here is that a progressive society should understand that any majority is always
196680	200440	going to be inherently oppressive towards minorities, no matter what people do, and
200440	204960	therefore in order to be good and moral, we should give their needs extra consideration. This is the
204960	209080	foundation for programs like affirmative action in schools or in hiring practices, or public
209080	212400	representation in entertainment, or providing them a special seat in government or corporate
212400	216120	functions to ensure that their unique viewpoint has a chance to be heard and considered by the
216120	220760	majority. Regardless of whether any of this is good or bad, factual or fake, it doesn't matter.
220760	225000	This is what we think of when we think of the word minority in the Western world. And so,
225000	228840	the question is, why is the left slowly giving up that entire school of thought,
228840	234720	this entire foundation of moral legitimacy by switching rhetoric over from minorities to the
234720	239000	global majority? Well, let's consider a few ideas. Firstly, it seems to be the case that
239000	243280	progressives only stand up for certain types of minorities. And no, I'm not talking about them
243280	247480	suddenly being racist towards black conservatives or shitting on right-leaning trans people,
247480	251760	though that obviously does happen. The progs love to revoke the minority card of any individual
251760	255720	person who is actually a minority but doesn't align with their politics. And while that's
255720	259040	pretty funny and leads to some pretty cringe moments, that's not what I'm referring to here.
259040	262920	Ayn Rand, being a darling of the libertarians, though she disliked the libertarian movement
262920	267480	herself, is hated by progressives to the point that she doesn't count as reading a female author
267480	272000	in their view. Another funny example of evoking the minority card. But like every other great
272000	276800	writer of history, she has at least one rock-solid irrefutable point. And it's encapsulated in this
276800	281320	quote, the smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights
281400	285680	cannot claim to be the defenders of minorities. This seems to be the truth, as well as a shortcut
285680	289640	to the natural endpoint of intersectional theory. The intersectionalists say that while you may be
289640	294040	oppressed for being black and you may be oppressed for being gay in a different way, if you're black
294040	298480	and gay, the two separate forms of oppression bolster each other, with each way you are
298480	303120	oppressed or privileged, forming the bars and the gaps of a cage which imprisons you. The natural end
303120	307240	result of this idea is that every single individual is oppressed in a slightly different way, due to
307240	310440	everybody having slightly different life experiences, and that each person's oppression
310520	315000	is ultimately unique. Rand cuts through all the necessary intersectional calculations of how
315000	318760	you're a minority in one way and a majority in the other, to arrive at the inevitable endpoint.
318760	323400	That the individual is the smallest minority. A minority of one person weighed against the
323400	328800	majority that is the rest of the human race. And yet, leftists don't value individuals. They reject
328800	333960	individualism as a bourgeois capitalist mechanism that keeps communities and classes down. Class
333960	338720	consciousness for the socialist is the rejection of that individualistic idea and instead engaging
338720	343440	in solidarity with your social class. Race consciousness for, say, the black activist in
343440	348400	America works the same way, to the point that individualism is now often branded as a component
348400	352680	of white supremacy. Meanwhile, progressives aren't fond of individualism either, with a heavy
352680	357120	emphasis on social responsibility and the welfare state overpowering any individualist concerns.
357120	361280	The individual isn't the only minority that leftists don't advocate for. There's a joke
361280	365640	floating around that the rich are a minority that never sees any advocacy done for them by social
365640	369960	justice groups. And hey, you can't deny that. They're literally called the 1%. That's clearly
369960	374400	a minority. The obvious reply to this position is that even though the 1% are a minority,
374400	378920	they don't need activism due to their sheer material wealth. And this applies to politicians,
378920	383320	to presidents, to kings and nobility too. These are all minorities in society, but they wield
383320	388080	wealth and power and sometimes both, so they don't need advocates. The inverse logic also
388080	392280	applies. Consider women. When I was back in university taking that Intro to Gender Studies
392520	396320	class, women was considered a minority. The professor explained, even though women aren't
396320	401000	actually a minority, there are in fact more women than men on the planet. Women have minority status
401000	405160	in the progressive hierarchy because they're oppressed. Again, it's marginalization that
405160	409800	grants moral legitimacy, not actually being a member of a class with fewer numbers. Back in
409800	414780	the late 2000s, a majority population could be a minority if they were oppressed. So what's
414780	419240	actually happening here is that when a progressive calls upon the moral legitimacy of the minority,
419240	423560	it's not actually being a member of a minority class that generates that moral legitimacy. It's
423560	428480	being an outsider. In a majority white society, both a white king and a black peasant are,
428480	432280	in their own way, a minority. But the king is at the center of the society while the black
432280	436160	peasant is on the margins. Hence the phrase marginalization. What matters in the Prague
436160	440400	estimation isn't that you're a minority, but it's that you're marginalized. This is how they can
440400	444920	justify excluding Asians from affirmative action schemes because they might be a minority, but
444920	448960	they're not marginalized in their view. Majority populations having most of the wealth and power
449000	453240	in a given society don't need to be protected in the same way that minority ones do. Until,
453240	457240	of course, the Prague suddenly do want to claim that status rhetorically through the use of the
457240	460720	phrase global majority. And so far I've been describing what's been going on here, but we
460720	465580	still haven't gotten to why the slow switch between protect minorities to protect the global
465580	470440	majority is taking place. Let's talk about the source of political authority. All post-enlightenment
470440	474760	philosophies, liberalism, socialism, and fascism, claim to draw their political authority from the
474760	479160	bottom up. Liberals talk about representative democracy, the voter, the citizen, and it's
479160	483160	through the polity that legitimate political power springs. Socialists talk about production,
483160	487720	the worker, the proletariat. To them, those who do all the productive labor of society are the
487720	492040	source of legitimate political power. Fascists talk about ethnicity, the blood, the people. To
492040	496560	them, legitimate political power comes from biological and cultural solidarity. All three
496560	501360	of these philosophies are, in some way, majoritarian. They appeal to the vast majority
501360	505400	of people under their rule for their legitimacy, and they claim to be implementing the will of
505400	510640	that majority. But pre-enlightenment philosophies, like monarchy, for example, they're minoritarian.
510640	514720	They don't care about gaining legitimacy from the citizen, or the worker, or the people. They
514720	519280	don't answer to the majority. The divine right of kings was not simply a top-down imposition of
519280	522800	political power, though it was certainly that. But it was also an admission that the monarch's
522800	527520	place in the hierarchy was below God. That even as they drew their political legitimacy from God,
527560	531840	they also had to submit to him. In secular terms, the minoritarian view is that a good leader does
531840	536040	not simply bend to the whims of the majority of those he rules over, because those whims might be
536040	540480	retarded. Instead, his job is to implement a political ideal as imperfectly as he can,
540480	544760	because he's still only just a human, and not be swayed by the sort-sighted, selfish politics
544760	548960	of the day. The reason that modern liberal democracy is unique is because it attempts to
548960	554120	blend both types of legitimacy. Constitutional monarchies, like the UK, Canada, Australia,
554120	558880	Japan, feature both bottom-up and top-down characteristics, with representative democracy
558880	562880	speaking for the commoners, and a monarch that represents an ideal that those societies should
562880	567080	be united in striving towards, despite their political differences. Meanwhile, constitutional
567080	571360	republics like America or India have in the position of the ideal, not a monarch, but a
571360	576000	constitution. It nonetheless takes on a similar function, to outline a political ideal that,
576000	580480	regardless of the whims of the day, cannot be violated so easily. And yes, because I'm a
580480	584760	liberal centrist cuck, I think striking this balance is the best way to do it. A society
584760	589280	which derives political legitimacy in a purely top-down manner is primed for terrible abuses
589280	593000	of power, where the motivations and goals of rulers fail to take into account the ruled,
593000	598040	or worse yet, actively move against the ruled's interests. What rightoids, especially monarchist
598040	602760	rightoids in Europe, often fail to grasp is that even for an enlightened, benevolent philosopher
602760	607120	king, there needs to be a plebeian check on his power, because there's no reason to assume his
607120	611440	children will be just as good as him. Meanwhile, a society which derives political legitimacy in a
611440	616000	purely bottom-up manner immediately falls to the tyranny of the majority, where those who are
616000	620800	different are punished for it, simply because they are different. But leftoids, especially anarchists
620800	625320	and direct democracy socialists, often fail to grasp is that ten men gang-raping a woman,
625320	631320	or ten whites lynching a black man, is a democratic act, and that minorities and individuals do need
631320	636840	to be protected from the power of majority rule. That is why a liberal capitalist democratic system
636880	641800	values the vote, but does not hold it as the ultimate value. It's why the people still
641800	646560	ultimately decide, but there are limits on that power. During the Russian revolutionary period,
646560	651160	the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was split into two factions. Firstly, the Mensheviks,
651160	655760	a Russian word meaning one of the minority, headed by Julius Martov. And secondly, the Bolsheviks,
655760	659880	a Russian word meaning one of the majority, headed by Vladimir Lenin. The names of these
659880	664600	groups didn't accurately describe their popularity. The five-party congresses before the party was
664600	668720	dissolved in 1918 showed the Bolsheviks winning two majorities, the Mensheviks winning two,
668720	672680	and one with no clear winner due to multiple other factions. But nonetheless, their names
672680	677320	did describe how they each viewed political power. Martov, as the head of the Mensheviks,
677320	682000	was described in the book A People's Tragedy as being too good an intellectual to be a successful
682000	686200	politician, that he was held back from making extremist moves due to his integrity, and he
686200	689880	chose his allies by the coherence of their worldview rather than the practical situation
689880	693800	on the ground. He was applauded for his high-minded approach, but he was also considered indecisive
694000	698680	during times of crisis, earning the Mensheviks the nickname of the Sofs. Lenin, as head of the
698680	703640	Bolsheviks, was described in the book The Life of Lenin as having an iron will, self-enslaving
703640	708040	self-discipline, scorn for his opponents and for obstacles, the cold determination of a zealot,
708040	712000	the drive of a fanatic, and the ability to convince or browbeat weaker persons by his
712000	716040	singleness of purpose, imposing intensity, impersonal approach, personal sacrifice,
716040	720400	political astuteness, and the complete conviction of the possession of the absolute truth. In his
720400	725440	morality, he was a ruthless utilitarian, saying simply, does a certain action advance or hinder
725440	730000	the cause of the revolution? Lenin and Martov were close friends. Even after the Bolsheviks
730000	733920	took total control of Russia, outlawed the Mensheviks, and Martov was exiled to Europe,
733920	737960	Lenin still thought of him as a friend. And on his deathbed, Lenin lamented that Martov,
737960	743000	somewhere else in the world, was also reported to be on his own deathbed. Two very different men,
743000	747560	both with their own strengths and weaknesses. Martov's intelligence and morals were admirable
747560	751920	qualities, but his lack of political experience left him open to Lenin's ruthlessness and
751920	756380	amorality. And just in case that story makes you think, look, the guy who stuck to his principles
756380	760840	got backstabbed and the guy who did not won. Clearly abandoning your morality in the pursuit
760840	765640	of power is good. Look at what Lenin's ruthlessness and amorality did to Russia afterward.
765640	769800	This is just my personal opinion here. I believe that the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks were not
769800	773920	named after literally being the majority or the minority of the socialist movement in Russia,
774040	778800	but instead because the rank and file of those two movements did actually come to reflect the
778800	783640	behaviors of their two leaders. The majority is an oppressive force. The left is correct when they
783640	788400	point this out. Therefore, it's no surprise that when leftists are in the minority, they appeal to
788400	793280	liberal principles. The idea that the center of society should not simply do what it will to those
793280	797640	in the margins, but actually treat them with some decency. But when they become the majority,
797640	802240	they don't appeal to that liberal principle anymore. And they take on the full moral weight
802280	807000	of that oppressive majority to crush their opponents in the name of doing what the majority
807000	811840	wants. And because liberal institutions have limits on democratic power, leftists always
811840	815600	tried to dismantle those limits in the name of liberating the majority. You know that Frank
815600	819520	Herbert quote, when I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your
819520	823400	principles. But when I'm stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that's according to my
823400	828240	principles. That's particularly relevant here. The enemies of liberalism view liberal values
828240	832920	like free speech, free association, capitalism and property, equality before the law, not as
832920	837140	principles to be upheld for all, but to be used and abused while they're on the margins and to
837140	841600	be dismantled once they take power. When a leftist appeals to the minority, it's a signal that they
841600	846560	view themselves on the margins. They're weak and downtrodden and deserve our special consideration
846560	850920	beyond liberal freedoms and equality before the law. But when a leftist begins to say we're the
850920	856320	majority instead, like the slow shift to global minority, or like the use of the term Bolshevik,
856360	861240	it's a signal that they view themselves as taking power, that now their moral legitimacy comes from
861240	865480	representing most people, not from being an outsider, and that therefore they should be
865480	870200	listened to over any sort of pesky minority, like anybody who happens to disagree with them. And to
870200	874160	me, that's a pretty scary shift. If you think I'm speaking out of my ass, you should read this paper
874160	878840	written by the person who coined the term global majority in the first place on how she intended
878840	884520	for it to be used a UK intellectual by the name of Rosemary Campbell Stevens. Global majority is a
884560	889120	collective term that first and foremost speaks to and encourages those so called to think of
889120	893480	themselves as belonging to the global majority. It refers to people who are black, Asian, brown,
893480	898840	dual heritage, indigenous to the global south, and or have been racialized as ethnic minorities.
898840	903600	Globally, these groups currently represent approximately 80% of the world's population,
903600	907760	making them the global majority. Understanding that singular truth may shift the dial,
907760	912800	it certainly should permanently disrupt and relocate the conversation. Applying the term
912800	918560	global majority to groups that are routinely either not seen or marginalized not only bring
918560	923720	in people from the margins, but brings into focus what may create marginalization, including the
923720	928520	historical and current role of systemic racism, white privilege, and the power dynamics therein.
928520	933800	The white elite act globally, their power has historically resided in large part in the fact
933800	938440	that 1% of the world's population holds approximately 44% of the world's wealth.
938440	942840	They are globally connected, operate collectively in their mutually exclusive interest,
942840	947200	wielding power accordingly through transnational corporations, organizations, financial
947200	951680	institutions, governments, and multinationals. Connected systems, economic, business, political,
951680	956280	educational, health, all work with synchronized mindsets focused on maintaining the status quo,
956280	961080	while simultaneously sowing and fueling discord elsewhere. The elite minority are aided and
961080	965480	abetted across the globe by those who are not white, but who want desperately to appropriate
965480	970560	whiteness. The so-called third world, the occupied territory created for the global majority,
970560	975240	is needed to maintain the concentration, flow, and control of resources, wealth,
975240	980320	and power into the hands of the few in the first world. Poor whites are the basic members of the
980320	985080	white club, with minimal benefits. They are there to make up numbers when required, be the deflectors
985080	989000	or cannon fodder, and essentially act as the buffer between the white elite and those they
989000	993280	have othered. The non-white allies are as intentional about joining the club as the
993280	996520	elites are about maintaining the status quo and keeping them firmly at arm's length.
996520	1000720	Of course, you could never speak like this about any other race, whether true or false.
1000720	1004040	Kanye is learning that the hard way right now. And it doesn't even matter that a lot of the
1004040	1008640	stuff in here is false. Like the idea that the world's elite doesn't contain a lot of non-white
1008640	1012920	people. Like non-white mega-rich people or the ruling elite of non-white countries don't exist
1012920	1017000	or something. Because the underlying logic is clear. The progressive movement is winning. Things
1017000	1022240	are changing. It's now time to stop deriving moral legitimacy from being a minority, an other,
1022280	1027280	a victim, those in the margins. Now is the time to seize the moral legitimacy of the center. To
1027280	1031960	take the reins of power and oppress the way that we imagine our ancestors were oppressed. To reject
1031960	1036960	liberal colorblindness and right a generational wrong. It is terrifying that this is how the
1036960	1041760	people who actually follow critical race theory think. Yes, some of what Europeans did to
1041760	1046240	non-Europeans during the age of colonization was brutal, obviously. But we don't live in that age
1046240	1051160	anymore. We've learned from those mistakes. And yet, some people still want revenge for a crime,
1051200	1055800	nobody alive in the West committed, and none of them ever actually experienced. All you have to
1055800	1060720	do is hop on Twitter and see an infinite number of progs say that this is a revenge for colonization.
1060720	1064960	To understand that they've abandoned the liberal principles we were meant to live by, preferring a
1064960	1070040	fucking race war instead. Anybody who thinks like this is, in my opinion, morally reprehensible. And,
1070040	1076000	as the phrase global majority becomes more popular over the next decade, expect a lot of people to go
1076000	1077640	way more mask off.
