00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080
During the most recent weekly sip, I read this astonishing article,

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,080
Non-Binary Romeo and Juliet set in Nazi Germany apologizes for omitting Jews from the casting

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,160
call. A production of Romeo and Juliet for non-binary performers, with Juliet reimagined

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,720
as a persecuted Jew and Romeo as a member of the Hitler Youth, has become embroiled over its failure

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,000
to include Jewish people in a casting call. The company advertised for non-binary artists and

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,520
or those of global majority, Black or Asian heritage to join the cast. The call did not

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,480
include any request for Jewish performers to join the cast of the production, set in the Third Reich,

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,040
and the company has publicly apologized for the omission. Please accept our profound apologies

9
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,800
for neglecting to mention the performers of Jewish background or preferred for the Capulets.

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,200
This was the initial intention. The director is Jewish and our intention has always been to

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,920
include this casting preference. My God, doesn't that sound like an amazing show? I'd love to go

12
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,520
see that nonsense. Romeo as a non-binary member of the Hitler Youth, Juliet's probably a Black

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,080
Jewish lesbian in a wheelchair, white-facing as Anne Frank. Incredible. But my curiosity was

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,080
drawn to one specific passage. One word, actually. The company advertised for non-binary artists and

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,080
or those of global majority, Black or Asian heritage. Global majority? This is the first

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,600
I'd ever heard the term, but it's pretty obvious what it means, right? In white majority countries,

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,040
Black people or Asian people are a racial minority, and we use that term minority to refer

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,360
to them. But on a global scale, there's clearly more Black and Asian people than there are white

19
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,680
people, making them the global majority. It's a pretty intuitive term, but where did it come from?

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,240
And why is there a switch from language about minorities to the majority? When people think

21
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,720
about minorities, they often think in broad terms left-wing politics. Your average progressive draws

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,200
moral legitimacy by appealing to the rights of or the protection of various minority groups,

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,400
racial or ethnic minorities, sexual or gender minorities, religious minorities,

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,440
people with various disabilities, even if they're wildly different, are often called upon as if

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,960
they're a minority. The idea is that the majority culture is always going to be inherently oppressive

26
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,600
towards these minorities. An obvious example is in a majority Christian society, the state,

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,160
the social institutions, and the general culture is going to broadly be pro-Christian and may

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,960
actively discriminate against or suppress non-Christians, maybe with state force,

29
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,400
maybe with differing rules for interacting with social institutions, maybe with cultural

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,680
exclusion. But even if that society did not actually do any of those things, there's always

31
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,760
going to be a base level of background radiation style discrimination. The best example I can think

32
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,680
of right now is from another Weekly Sip article, where that Muslim mother decried society being so

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,560
Christmas-oriented during December and how hard it was to shield her children from the influence

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,720
of the overarching culture she was living in in the West. From her point of view, even though

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,680
nobody's actually oppressing her, nobody's excluding her from Christmas, and nobody's

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,040
preventing her from opting out of Christmas and celebrating her own holidays, the fact that she

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,320
lives in a culture where Christmas is celebrated means she feels othered every time she steps

38
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,480
outside. In effect, from her point of view, the normal, polite goings-on of a culture she lives

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,080
in but is not part of feels exclusionary to her. And a Christian who happened to be in the Middle

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,640
East during Ramadan or something would likely feel the same way. Even if he was left alone to

41
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,120
not participate, there would still be that feeling of being a stranger in a strange land. The

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,680
implication here is that a progressive society should understand that any majority is always

43
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,440
going to be inherently oppressive towards minorities, no matter what people do, and

44
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,960
therefore in order to be good and moral, we should give their needs extra consideration. This is the

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,080
foundation for programs like affirmative action in schools or in hiring practices, or public

46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,400
representation in entertainment, or providing them a special seat in government or corporate

47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,120
functions to ensure that their unique viewpoint has a chance to be heard and considered by the

48
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,760
majority. Regardless of whether any of this is good or bad, factual or fake, it doesn't matter.

49
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,000
This is what we think of when we think of the word minority in the Western world. And so,

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,840
the question is, why is the left slowly giving up that entire school of thought,

51
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,720
this entire foundation of moral legitimacy by switching rhetoric over from minorities to the

52
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,000
global majority? Well, let's consider a few ideas. Firstly, it seems to be the case that

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,280
progressives only stand up for certain types of minorities. And no, I'm not talking about them

54
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,480
suddenly being racist towards black conservatives or shitting on right-leaning trans people,

55
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,760
though that obviously does happen. The progs love to revoke the minority card of any individual

56
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,720
person who is actually a minority but doesn't align with their politics. And while that's

57
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,040
pretty funny and leads to some pretty cringe moments, that's not what I'm referring to here.

58
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,920
Ayn Rand, being a darling of the libertarians, though she disliked the libertarian movement

59
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,480
herself, is hated by progressives to the point that she doesn't count as reading a female author

60
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,000
in their view. Another funny example of evoking the minority card. But like every other great

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,800
writer of history, she has at least one rock-solid irrefutable point. And it's encapsulated in this

62
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,320
quote, the smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights

63
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,680
cannot claim to be the defenders of minorities. This seems to be the truth, as well as a shortcut

64
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,640
to the natural endpoint of intersectional theory. The intersectionalists say that while you may be

65
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,040
oppressed for being black and you may be oppressed for being gay in a different way, if you're black

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,480
and gay, the two separate forms of oppression bolster each other, with each way you are

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,120
oppressed or privileged, forming the bars and the gaps of a cage which imprisons you. The natural end

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,240
result of this idea is that every single individual is oppressed in a slightly different way, due to

69
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,440
everybody having slightly different life experiences, and that each person's oppression

70
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,000
is ultimately unique. Rand cuts through all the necessary intersectional calculations of how

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,760
you're a minority in one way and a majority in the other, to arrive at the inevitable endpoint.

72
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,400
That the individual is the smallest minority. A minority of one person weighed against the

73
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,800
majority that is the rest of the human race. And yet, leftists don't value individuals. They reject

74
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,960
individualism as a bourgeois capitalist mechanism that keeps communities and classes down. Class

75
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,720
consciousness for the socialist is the rejection of that individualistic idea and instead engaging

76
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,440
in solidarity with your social class. Race consciousness for, say, the black activist in

77
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,400
America works the same way, to the point that individualism is now often branded as a component

78
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,680
of white supremacy. Meanwhile, progressives aren't fond of individualism either, with a heavy

79
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,120
emphasis on social responsibility and the welfare state overpowering any individualist concerns.

80
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,280
The individual isn't the only minority that leftists don't advocate for. There's a joke

81
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,640
floating around that the rich are a minority that never sees any advocacy done for them by social

82
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,960
justice groups. And hey, you can't deny that. They're literally called the 1%. That's clearly

83
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,400
a minority. The obvious reply to this position is that even though the 1% are a minority,

84
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,920
they don't need activism due to their sheer material wealth. And this applies to politicians,

85
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,320
to presidents, to kings and nobility too. These are all minorities in society, but they wield

86
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,080
wealth and power and sometimes both, so they don't need advocates. The inverse logic also

87
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,280
applies. Consider women. When I was back in university taking that Intro to Gender Studies

88
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,320
class, women was considered a minority. The professor explained, even though women aren't

89
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,000
actually a minority, there are in fact more women than men on the planet. Women have minority status

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,160
in the progressive hierarchy because they're oppressed. Again, it's marginalization that

91
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,800
grants moral legitimacy, not actually being a member of a class with fewer numbers. Back in

92
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,780
the late 2000s, a majority population could be a minority if they were oppressed. So what's

93
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,240
actually happening here is that when a progressive calls upon the moral legitimacy of the minority,

94
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,560
it's not actually being a member of a minority class that generates that moral legitimacy. It's

95
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,480
being an outsider. In a majority white society, both a white king and a black peasant are,

96
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,280
in their own way, a minority. But the king is at the center of the society while the black

97
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,160
peasant is on the margins. Hence the phrase marginalization. What matters in the Prague

98
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,400
estimation isn't that you're a minority, but it's that you're marginalized. This is how they can

99
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,920
justify excluding Asians from affirmative action schemes because they might be a minority, but

100
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,960
they're not marginalized in their view. Majority populations having most of the wealth and power

101
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,240
in a given society don't need to be protected in the same way that minority ones do. Until,

102
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,240
of course, the Prague suddenly do want to claim that status rhetorically through the use of the

103
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,720
phrase global majority. And so far I've been describing what's been going on here, but we

104
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,580
still haven't gotten to why the slow switch between protect minorities to protect the global

105
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,440
majority is taking place. Let's talk about the source of political authority. All post-enlightenment

106
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,760
philosophies, liberalism, socialism, and fascism, claim to draw their political authority from the

107
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,160
bottom up. Liberals talk about representative democracy, the voter, the citizen, and it's

108
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,160
through the polity that legitimate political power springs. Socialists talk about production,

109
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,720
the worker, the proletariat. To them, those who do all the productive labor of society are the

110
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,040
source of legitimate political power. Fascists talk about ethnicity, the blood, the people. To

111
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,560
them, legitimate political power comes from biological and cultural solidarity. All three

112
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,360
of these philosophies are, in some way, majoritarian. They appeal to the vast majority

113
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,400
of people under their rule for their legitimacy, and they claim to be implementing the will of

114
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,640
that majority. But pre-enlightenment philosophies, like monarchy, for example, they're minoritarian.

115
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,720
They don't care about gaining legitimacy from the citizen, or the worker, or the people. They

116
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,280
don't answer to the majority. The divine right of kings was not simply a top-down imposition of

117
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,800
political power, though it was certainly that. But it was also an admission that the monarch's

118
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,520
place in the hierarchy was below God. That even as they drew their political legitimacy from God,

119
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,840
they also had to submit to him. In secular terms, the minoritarian view is that a good leader does

120
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,040
not simply bend to the whims of the majority of those he rules over, because those whims might be

121
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,480
retarded. Instead, his job is to implement a political ideal as imperfectly as he can,

122
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,760
because he's still only just a human, and not be swayed by the sort-sighted, selfish politics

123
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,960
of the day. The reason that modern liberal democracy is unique is because it attempts to

124
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,120
blend both types of legitimacy. Constitutional monarchies, like the UK, Canada, Australia,

125
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,880
Japan, feature both bottom-up and top-down characteristics, with representative democracy

126
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,880
speaking for the commoners, and a monarch that represents an ideal that those societies should

127
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,080
be united in striving towards, despite their political differences. Meanwhile, constitutional

128
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,360
republics like America or India have in the position of the ideal, not a monarch, but a

129
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,000
constitution. It nonetheless takes on a similar function, to outline a political ideal that,

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,480
regardless of the whims of the day, cannot be violated so easily. And yes, because I'm a

131
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,760
liberal centrist cuck, I think striking this balance is the best way to do it. A society

132
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,280
which derives political legitimacy in a purely top-down manner is primed for terrible abuses

133
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,000
of power, where the motivations and goals of rulers fail to take into account the ruled,

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,040
or worse yet, actively move against the ruled's interests. What rightoids, especially monarchist

135
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,760
rightoids in Europe, often fail to grasp is that even for an enlightened, benevolent philosopher

136
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,120
king, there needs to be a plebeian check on his power, because there's no reason to assume his

137
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,440
children will be just as good as him. Meanwhile, a society which derives political legitimacy in a

138
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,000
purely bottom-up manner immediately falls to the tyranny of the majority, where those who are

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,800
different are punished for it, simply because they are different. But leftoids, especially anarchists

140
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,320
and direct democracy socialists, often fail to grasp is that ten men gang-raping a woman,

141
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,320
or ten whites lynching a black man, is a democratic act, and that minorities and individuals do need

142
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,840
to be protected from the power of majority rule. That is why a liberal capitalist democratic system

143
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,800
values the vote, but does not hold it as the ultimate value. It's why the people still

144
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,560
ultimately decide, but there are limits on that power. During the Russian revolutionary period,

145
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,160
the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was split into two factions. Firstly, the Mensheviks,

146
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,760
a Russian word meaning one of the minority, headed by Julius Martov. And secondly, the Bolsheviks,

147
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,880
a Russian word meaning one of the majority, headed by Vladimir Lenin. The names of these

148
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,600
groups didn't accurately describe their popularity. The five-party congresses before the party was

149
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,720
dissolved in 1918 showed the Bolsheviks winning two majorities, the Mensheviks winning two,

150
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,680
and one with no clear winner due to multiple other factions. But nonetheless, their names

151
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,320
did describe how they each viewed political power. Martov, as the head of the Mensheviks,

152
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,000
was described in the book A People's Tragedy as being too good an intellectual to be a successful

153
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,200
politician, that he was held back from making extremist moves due to his integrity, and he

154
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,880
chose his allies by the coherence of their worldview rather than the practical situation

155
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,800
on the ground. He was applauded for his high-minded approach, but he was also considered indecisive

156
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,680
during times of crisis, earning the Mensheviks the nickname of the Sofs. Lenin, as head of the

157
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,640
Bolsheviks, was described in the book The Life of Lenin as having an iron will, self-enslaving

158
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,040
self-discipline, scorn for his opponents and for obstacles, the cold determination of a zealot,

159
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,000
the drive of a fanatic, and the ability to convince or browbeat weaker persons by his

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,040
singleness of purpose, imposing intensity, impersonal approach, personal sacrifice,

161
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,400
political astuteness, and the complete conviction of the possession of the absolute truth. In his

162
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,440
morality, he was a ruthless utilitarian, saying simply, does a certain action advance or hinder

163
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,000
the cause of the revolution? Lenin and Martov were close friends. Even after the Bolsheviks

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,920
took total control of Russia, outlawed the Mensheviks, and Martov was exiled to Europe,

165
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,960
Lenin still thought of him as a friend. And on his deathbed, Lenin lamented that Martov,

166
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,000
somewhere else in the world, was also reported to be on his own deathbed. Two very different men,

167
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,560
both with their own strengths and weaknesses. Martov's intelligence and morals were admirable

168
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,920
qualities, but his lack of political experience left him open to Lenin's ruthlessness and

169
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,380
amorality. And just in case that story makes you think, look, the guy who stuck to his principles

170
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,840
got backstabbed and the guy who did not won. Clearly abandoning your morality in the pursuit

171
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,640
of power is good. Look at what Lenin's ruthlessness and amorality did to Russia afterward.

172
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,800
This is just my personal opinion here. I believe that the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks were not

173
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,920
named after literally being the majority or the minority of the socialist movement in Russia,

174
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,800
but instead because the rank and file of those two movements did actually come to reflect the

175
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,640
behaviors of their two leaders. The majority is an oppressive force. The left is correct when they

176
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,400
point this out. Therefore, it's no surprise that when leftists are in the minority, they appeal to

177
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,280
liberal principles. The idea that the center of society should not simply do what it will to those

178
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,640
in the margins, but actually treat them with some decency. But when they become the majority,

179
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,240
they don't appeal to that liberal principle anymore. And they take on the full moral weight

180
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,000
of that oppressive majority to crush their opponents in the name of doing what the majority

181
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,840
wants. And because liberal institutions have limits on democratic power, leftists always

182
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,600
tried to dismantle those limits in the name of liberating the majority. You know that Frank

183
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,520
Herbert quote, when I am weaker than you, I ask you for freedom because that is according to your

184
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,400
principles. But when I'm stronger than you, I take away your freedom because that's according to my

185
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,240
principles. That's particularly relevant here. The enemies of liberalism view liberal values

186
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,920
like free speech, free association, capitalism and property, equality before the law, not as

187
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,140
principles to be upheld for all, but to be used and abused while they're on the margins and to

188
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,600
be dismantled once they take power. When a leftist appeals to the minority, it's a signal that they

189
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,560
view themselves on the margins. They're weak and downtrodden and deserve our special consideration

190
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,920
beyond liberal freedoms and equality before the law. But when a leftist begins to say we're the

191
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,320
majority instead, like the slow shift to global minority, or like the use of the term Bolshevik,

192
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,240
it's a signal that they view themselves as taking power, that now their moral legitimacy comes from

193
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,480
representing most people, not from being an outsider, and that therefore they should be

194
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,200
listened to over any sort of pesky minority, like anybody who happens to disagree with them. And to

195
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,160
me, that's a pretty scary shift. If you think I'm speaking out of my ass, you should read this paper

196
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,840
written by the person who coined the term global majority in the first place on how she intended

197
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,520
for it to be used a UK intellectual by the name of Rosemary Campbell Stevens. Global majority is a

198
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,120
collective term that first and foremost speaks to and encourages those so called to think of

199
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,480
themselves as belonging to the global majority. It refers to people who are black, Asian, brown,

200
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,840
dual heritage, indigenous to the global south, and or have been racialized as ethnic minorities.

201
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,600
Globally, these groups currently represent approximately 80% of the world's population,

202
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,760
making them the global majority. Understanding that singular truth may shift the dial,

203
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,800
it certainly should permanently disrupt and relocate the conversation. Applying the term

204
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,560
global majority to groups that are routinely either not seen or marginalized not only bring

205
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,720
in people from the margins, but brings into focus what may create marginalization, including the

206
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,520
historical and current role of systemic racism, white privilege, and the power dynamics therein.

207
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,800
The white elite act globally, their power has historically resided in large part in the fact

208
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,440
that 1% of the world's population holds approximately 44% of the world's wealth.

209
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,840
They are globally connected, operate collectively in their mutually exclusive interest,

210
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,200
wielding power accordingly through transnational corporations, organizations, financial

211
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,680
institutions, governments, and multinationals. Connected systems, economic, business, political,

212
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,280
educational, health, all work with synchronized mindsets focused on maintaining the status quo,

213
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,080
while simultaneously sowing and fueling discord elsewhere. The elite minority are aided and

214
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,480
abetted across the globe by those who are not white, but who want desperately to appropriate

215
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,560
whiteness. The so-called third world, the occupied territory created for the global majority,

216
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,240
is needed to maintain the concentration, flow, and control of resources, wealth,

217
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,320
and power into the hands of the few in the first world. Poor whites are the basic members of the

218
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,080
white club, with minimal benefits. They are there to make up numbers when required, be the deflectors

219
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,000
or cannon fodder, and essentially act as the buffer between the white elite and those they

220
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,280
have othered. The non-white allies are as intentional about joining the club as the

221
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,520
elites are about maintaining the status quo and keeping them firmly at arm's length.

222
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,720
Of course, you could never speak like this about any other race, whether true or false.

223
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,040
Kanye is learning that the hard way right now. And it doesn't even matter that a lot of the

224
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,640
stuff in here is false. Like the idea that the world's elite doesn't contain a lot of non-white

225
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,920
people. Like non-white mega-rich people or the ruling elite of non-white countries don't exist

226
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,000
or something. Because the underlying logic is clear. The progressive movement is winning. Things

227
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,240
are changing. It's now time to stop deriving moral legitimacy from being a minority, an other,

228
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,280
a victim, those in the margins. Now is the time to seize the moral legitimacy of the center. To

229
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,960
take the reins of power and oppress the way that we imagine our ancestors were oppressed. To reject

230
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,960
liberal colorblindness and right a generational wrong. It is terrifying that this is how the

231
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,760
people who actually follow critical race theory think. Yes, some of what Europeans did to

232
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,240
non-Europeans during the age of colonization was brutal, obviously. But we don't live in that age

233
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,160
anymore. We've learned from those mistakes. And yet, some people still want revenge for a crime,

234
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,800
nobody alive in the West committed, and none of them ever actually experienced. All you have to

235
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,720
do is hop on Twitter and see an infinite number of progs say that this is a revenge for colonization.

236
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,960
To understand that they've abandoned the liberal principles we were meant to live by, preferring a

237
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,040
fucking race war instead. Anybody who thinks like this is, in my opinion, morally reprehensible. And,

238
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:56,000
as the phrase global majority becomes more popular over the next decade, expect a lot of people to go

239
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,640
way more mask off.
