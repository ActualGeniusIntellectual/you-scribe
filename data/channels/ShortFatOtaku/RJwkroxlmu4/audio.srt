1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
I never thought that I'd have to wake up one day and wonder if my entire website was

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,660
going to be unplugged because of an opinion that I expressed.

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,300
Social media's been censoring everyone, not just conservatives, for a long time now.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,340
It ramped up after Trump and Brexit because the neoliberal establishment wasn't used

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,780
to losing elections.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:26,940
Everyone, from the alt-right to the communists, neo-nazis, radical leftists, even libertarians,

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,820
centrists, classical liberals, anyone who wasn't entirely safe and sanitized and family-friendly

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,040
eventually, for one reason or another, saw the long arm of censorship come for them.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,020
The behaviours of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other big tech companies on this matter

10
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,540
goes entirely against the spirit, if not the letter, of current legislation.

11
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:53,800
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act basically made the modern internet.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,640
It allowed platforms, like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, to not be held legally liable

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,480
for the content their users post, if they make good faith attempts to moderate that

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,120
content in an unbiased manner.

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,580
And I hate to break it to all the idealists listening in here, but free speech was not

16
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,400
the only reason this law was put into place.

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,160
American supremacy in the tech-cultural sphere would absolutely fall behind the rest of the

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,300
world if all of the fledgling startups were squashed by thousands of lawsuits due to edgy

19
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,460
shitposts made on their services.

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,940
And it was these safe harbour protections that made the early internet so great.

21
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,900
Yes, it was the wild west.

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,720
Yes, people flung shit, all the time.

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,820
But there was rapid growth, there was expansion, there were new ideas being passed around.

24
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,460
People were figuring things out for themselves, largely unshackled by any kind of larger authority.

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,860
It was the wet dream of anybody who values digital freedom.

26
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,140
But slowly, as time went on, the people who ran these companies, like Mark Zuckerberg

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,220
and Jack Dorsey and others, they went from being free-speech entrepreneur-libertarian

28
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:02,700
types in their mid-twenties, to grouchy, wokes-gold millennials in their mid-thirties.

29
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,340
And slowly over time this began to reflect in the way those platforms were moderated.

30
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:12,020
Safety became more important to them than freedom, so bit by bit free speech was chipped

31
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,900
away from all sides, left, right, doesn't matter.

32
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,300
And when you finally arrive here, in 2020, they are routinely banning speech that is

33
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,940
explicitly allowed under the first amendment.

34
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,260
And when they began doing that, they became editors of content, not neutral platforms.

35
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,100
And Trump's finally had enough.

36
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,980
The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist, shadow, ban,

37
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,620
are editorial decisions, pure and simple, they're editorial decisions.

38
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,380
In those moments, Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform and they become an editor

39
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,700
with a viewpoint, and I think we can say that about others also, whether you're looking

40
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,340
at Google, whether you're looking at Facebook, and perhaps others.

41
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,100
He wants to bring the government hammer down on them for this, and I don't blame him.

42
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,300
You would find it entirely unacceptable if, say, your phone provider read your texts or

43
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,940
listened to your calls, decided that you had said something that wasn't illegal but a

44
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,980
bit too edgy for their CEO's liking, and cut your phone service off.

45
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,820
That is exactly what social media is doing right now.

46
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,500
So Trump decided to put out an executive order on this topic.

47
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,580
An executive order isn't legislation.

48
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,700
He can't change existing law using an executive order.

49
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,020
He can push Republicans in the House to start putting forward legislation, but he can't

50
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,400
unilaterally just change the law himself.

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,700
An executive order is more like a declaration from the current administration on how they

52
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,760
plan to interpret existing law and how they plan to enforce it.

53
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,080
For example, Obama did a very similar thing with the Dreamers.

54
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,280
That was entirely executive order, and it basically amounted to him announcing that

55
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,620
enforcing certain parts of current immigration law would simply not be a high priority for

56
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,280
his administration, even though those exact laws weren't technically off the books at

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
the time.

58
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,480
So the executive order is titled Preventing Online Censorship, and if you want to read

59
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,320
the full thing, it's very easy to find online.

60
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,880
But here's the juicy bits.

61
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,840
The emergence and growth of online platforms in recent years raises important questions

62
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,720
about applying the ideals of the First Amendment to modern communications technology.

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,420
Today, many Americans follow the news, stay in touch with friends and family, and share

64
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,200
their views on current events through social media and other online platforms.

65
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,400
As a result, these platforms function in many ways as a 21st century equivalent of the public

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
square.

67
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,680
We cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to handpick the speech that Americans

68
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,480
may access and convey online.

69
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,560
This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.

70
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,520
When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree,

71
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,000
they exercise dangerous power.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Social media platforms are invoking inconsistent, irrational, and groundless justifications

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,900
to censor or otherwise punish American speech here at home, meanwhile several online platforms

74
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,700
are profiting from and promoting the aggression and disinformation spread by foreign governments

75
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,880
like China.

76
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,680
My commitment to free and open debate on the internet remains as strong as ever.

77
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,480
Therefore, it remains the policy of the United States that lawful content should be free

78
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,080
from censorship in our digital marketplace of ideas.

79
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,040
As a nation, we must foster and protect diverse viewpoints in today's digital communications

80
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,480
environment where all Americans can and should have a voice.

81
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,000
We must seek transparency and accountability from online platforms, and encourage standards

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,040
and tools to protect and preserve the integrity and openness of American discourse and freedom

83
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,280
of expression.

84
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,040
And here's where we talk about Section 230, it is the policy of the United States to foster

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,360
clear, non-discriminatory ground rules promoting free and open debate on the internet.

86
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,960
Promen among these rules is the immunity from liability created by Section 230C of the Communications

87
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,200
Decency Act.

88
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,600
It is the policy of the United States that the scope of that immunity should be clarified.

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,640
When an interactive computer service provider removes or restricts access to content and

90
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,560
its actions do not meet the criteria of Sub-Paragraph C2A of Section 230 of the Communications Decency

91
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,800
Act, it is engaged in editorial conduct.

92
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,220
By making itself an editor of content outside the protections of Sub-Paragraph C2A, such

93
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:30,020
a provider forfeits any protection from being deemed a publisher or speaker under Sub-Section

94
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:36,500
230C1, which properly applies only to a provider that merely provides a platform for content

95
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,460
supplied by others.

96
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,100
It is the policy of the United States that all departments and agencies should apply

97
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,760
Section 230C according to the interpretation set out in this section.

98
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,580
To further advance the policy described in Sub-Section A of this section, within 30 days

99
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,200
of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, through the National Telecommunications

100
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,880
and Information Administration, shall file a petition for rulemaking with the Federal

101
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,080
Communications Commission requesting that the FCC expeditiously propose regulations

102
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,840
to clarify the conditions under which an action restricting access to or availability of material

103
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,560
is not taken in good faith, particularly the conditions under which such actions will be

104
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,720
considered to be either deceptive, pretextual, or inconsistent with the provider's terms

105
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,160
of service, or the result of inadequate notice, the product of unreasoned explanation, or

106
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,080
having been undertaken without a meaningful opportunity to be heard.

107
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,480
And any other proposed regulations that the NTIA concludes may be appropriate to advance

108
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,680
the policy described in Sub-Section A of this section.

109
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,360
Long story short, Trump is going after their safe harbor exemptions.

110
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,840
Now strangely enough, Twitter and Facebook are actually at cross-purposes regarding this

111
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
whole thing.

112
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,160
Facebook and Twitter clash over fact-checking as Trump threats intensify.

113
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,240
For years, Twitter and Facebook have enjoyed a healthy rivalry.

114
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,600
They've competed for acquisitions, talent, and advertising dollars, and sometimes gone

115
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,760
so far as to copy each other's features in the never-ending pursuit to grow their

116
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
audiences.

117
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,320
But the clash between the two tech companies appeared to take on new life this week after

118
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,000
Twitter's decision to place fact-check labels on some of President Donald Trump's tweets

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,800
sparked a series of threats, including an imminent executive order regulating social

120
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,880
media companies.

121
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,360
The CEOs of the two companies traded criticisms in public.

122
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,580
Former employees posted their own jabs on social media, and some legislators were quick

123
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,140
to highlight the differences between the approach Twitter and Facebook took, potentially only

124
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,140
adding to the tensions.

125
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,280
"'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,' Facebook co-founder

126
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,100
and CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Fox News.

127
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,740
I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that

128
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,420
people say online."

129
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,500
Hours later, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey appeared to push back at the assertion, saying that

130
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,820
labeling the tweets with fact-checks does not make the social media company an arbiter

131
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
of truth.

132
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,420
Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute

133
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,180
so people can judge for themselves.

134
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,980
The problem with Jack's explanation is that he's not doing it universally to everyone.

135
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,780
He doesn't even have the manpower to do that.

136
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,900
It's very clearly politically motivated who Twitter is targeting.

137
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Yes, adding a header saying that this tweet might be fake news under a tweet that might

138
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,460
actually be fake news is the truth.

139
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,580
But if you only do it to a select number of accounts, and leave alone all the many millions

140
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,740
of other accounts that are also peddling fake news, then you have a serious problem

141
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,260
and it's not the fact that you're lying, it's the fact that you're only selectively telling

142
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,260
the truth.

143
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,860
It's very easy to cherry-pick which stories you want to cover, which messages you want

144
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,300
to label, where and when rules are going to be enforced, such that you're not actually

145
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,460
lying to anybody but you're still acting like a scumbag.

146
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,580
And don't think that I'm siding with everybody's favourite synth Zuckerberg on this either.

147
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,700
While it's admirable that he still believes that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of

148
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,980
truth of everything people say online, Facebook still routinely bans literally everyone for

149
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,480
nearly anything.

150
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,800
But of course because Zuckerberg, if only in speech and not in action, doesn't want

151
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,340
Facebook to be censoring everyone, the hashtag deletefacebook began briefly trending.

152
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,260
Look at all of these brainlets.

153
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,060
They are actually complaining that Facebook will not shut down speech they disapprove

154
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,060
of.

155
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,060
It's incredible.

156
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,500
Stop looking to authority figures, whether they're corporate or government or whatever,

157
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,480
to regulate your life for you.

158
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,860
It is your responsibility as an adult to take in all sources of information and try to synthesize

159
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,860
the truth.

160
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,060
Yes, that does mean you can't go through life on autopilot.

161
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,980
Welcome to not being an NPC.

162
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,940
I mean it's funny reading some of these, dude.

163
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,500
People are like posting Mark Zuckerberg killed Epstein, Mark Zuckerberg killed himself.

164
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,900
You know, obvious shitposts and being like, this is why Facebook needs to fact check every

165
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,900
single thing.

166
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,980
No, it's not.

167
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,980
That's just like stupid.

168
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,980
It's funny.

169
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,340
The best parts of the internet are still primarily places to fuck around and talk shit.

170
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,980
If you want to make a shitpost that says Mark Zuckerberg drinks bleach to try and cure the

171
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,940
coronavirus or something, I think you should be able to go ahead.

172
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,500
It's stupid fun, man.

173
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,140
Have you guys forgotten what fun is?

174
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,900
Oh, also, if you Gen Z brainlets are actually serious about this, you know that means you're

175
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,040
gonna have to stop using Instagram, right?

176
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,980
Since Facebook owns Instagram?

177
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,980
Though I have a feeling that's probably not gonna happen.

178
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,140
Y'all are way too addicted to your influencers or whatever.

179
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,140
I don't know.

180
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,140
I don't know what's going on over there.

181
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,140
I'm an old man at this point.

182
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,580
Take your executive order and shove it, Trump.

183
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,700
We're gonna keep telling the truth about you on Twitter and everywhere else.

184
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,700
Get used to it.

185
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
That's okay, man.

186
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,940
Like, seriously, I don't think this is aimed at you.

187
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,820
In fact, this is allowing you to do this.

188
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,660
Like imagine if there was a big shakeup over in the offices of all the various big tech

189
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,340
firms, all the social media companies, and a whole bunch of people on the extreme right

190
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,780
suddenly found themselves running those companies somehow.

191
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:51,260
Enforcing political neutrality on these companies would allow people like you to continue to

192
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,440
use those platforms to criticize Trump and other Republicans, and that's exactly how

193
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
it should be.

194
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,700
I think he's doing this to ensure that everyone has free speech, both you and people who disagree

195
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
with you.

196
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,120
And you know, maybe that's your problem with it.

197
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,640
Another trending hashtag that came about maybe a day or two later was hashtag Donald is over

198
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
democracy.

199
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,440
And it is very similar to the previous one in that it's just basically a whole bunch

200
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,400
of people who are celebrating the fact that when Trump tweeted about the current Minneapolis

201
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,480
riots, which I'm sure I will have to do a video on at a later date, but when Trump tweeted

202
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,220
about them, Twitter hid one of his tweets, said that it glorified violence, but still

203
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,220
allowed you to read it because, hey, he's the president.

204
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,520
But I guess there's a whole bunch of people that consider this to be like a giant own

205
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
or something.

206
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,220
So they're just going wild like, lol, Twitter put a thing on Trump's tweet.

207
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,220
Look at the loser.

208
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,360
He's still the president.

209
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,460
Do you think the internet points actually mean anything, man?

210
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,080
Do you think that Twitter's authority supersedes the authority of the president of the United

211
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
States?

212
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,960
And here's the tweet that caused the stir.

213
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,920
I can't stand back and watch this happen to a great American city, Minneapolis, a total

214
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
lack of leadership.

215
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,300
Either the very weak radical left mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the city

216
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,500
under control, or I will send in the National Guard and get the job done right.

217
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,020
Then the second tweet was blocked and had this message put over top of it.

218
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,740
This tweet violated the Twitter rules about glorifying violence.

219
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,060
However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the tweet

220
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,520
to remain accessible.

221
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,660
The blocked tweet says, these thugs are dishonouring the memory of George Floyd and I won't let

222
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,820
that happen.

223
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,040
Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the military is with him all the way.

224
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,880
Any difficulty and we will assume control, but when the looting starts, the shooting

225
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
starts.

226
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Thank you.

227
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,400
Now to me this doesn't seem like glorifying violence.

228
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,320
To me this just seems like Trump warning the mayor of Minneapolis to stop hamstringing

229
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,400
his own police force and have them step in and take control.

230
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,740
Because and like I said earlier, I will get into this in a different video, currently

231
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,200
what's going on in Minneapolis has nothing to do with the absolute injustice that is

232
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,960
the murder of George Floyd by a police officer and has everything to do with thugs, yes thugs,

233
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,580
rioting and looting.

234
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,600
But Twitter thinks this tweet is unacceptable.

235
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,460
While it's behind this message, it can't be liked or retweeted.

236
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,440
It can still be viewed and it's not deleted, presumably because as per the Supreme Court's

237
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,960
orders, the president's Twitter account is a matter of public record.

238
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,040
But I bet if this were anybody else, at least anybody else with this political persuasion,

239
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
this would be deleted.

240
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,240
We know this because Olivia Gatwood's take of burn it down, fuck property, fuck cops

241
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:43,000
is only currently offline not because Twitter deleted it, but because she deleted it after

242
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,920
everyone came down on her for such a terrible, awful take.

243
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,640
When people on the radical left advocate for violence in the name of their politics, it's

244
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,700
punching up, it's attacking people who have systemic power and privilege, and so it's

245
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,860
not glorifying violence.

246
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,940
But when President Trump says, hey, maybe restore law and order in your burning city

247
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,660
or else the feds will have to come in and handle it, apparently that's glorifying

248
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,780
violence.

249
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,900
There is obviously a political bias at play here.

250
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,140
The best part about this whole thing is that Jack Dorsey himself seems to want to go to

251
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,260
war against Trump over this.

252
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,620
Twitter comms started a thread where they talked about the public interest notice they

253
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,340
placed on Donald Trump's Twitter account and why they did it.

254
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,140
And then Jack retweeted that from his personal account.

255
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,820
Geez, it seems like he's openly picking a fight with Trump at this point.

256
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,020
I hope he's secure in his position.

257
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,500
But let's be honest here guys, the President isn't innocent himself.

258
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,000
Here is one of many morons who wants things to go even further in the other direction,

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,500
away from free speech.

260
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,220
Dear Jack Dorsey, delete these ugly tweets, they're vicious lies.

261
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,660
You must cleanse Twitter of this Trump stain, if not of Trump himself.

262
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,180
Sincerely, Tribelaw, a Twitter user who couldn't get away even once with what Trump gets away

263
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,220
with daily.

264
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,620
They want him banned.

265
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:10,660
They don't want the rules changed such that everyone can talk like Trump does.

266
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,780
They want the rules enforced on Trump and he be removed from Twitter entirely.

267
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:21,460
The article linked in this tweet covers an event that happened three or four days ago

268
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:26,340
where Trump was tweeting legitimately false information, I'm pretty sure, about the

269
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,220
death of Lori K. Closetus.

270
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,700
And here's one of those tweets.

271
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:36,420
Comcast should open up a long overdue Florida cold case against Psycho Joe Scarborough.

272
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,420
I know him and Crazy Mika well, used them beautifully in the last election, dumped them

273
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,660
nicely and will state on the record that he is nuts.

274
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,540
Besides bad ratings.

275
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,880
This is a very strange tweet guys.

276
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,080
These tweets are in reference to the death of Lori K. Closetus, which was at the time

277
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,920
nearly 20 years ago, suspected to be a murder, but later it came out that it was probably

278
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
just an accident.

279
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,240
However, Trump's here talking about it like it's a cold case.

280
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,500
Here is a letter sent from her husband to Jack Dorsey.

281
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,600
Nearly 19 years ago, my wife, who had an undiagnosed heart condition, fell and hit her head on

282
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,520
her desk at work.

283
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,080
She was found dead the next morning.

284
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,000
Her name is Lori K. Closetus and she was 28 years old when she died.

285
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,360
Her passing is the single most painful thing that I have ever had to deal with in my 52

286
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,440
years and continues to haunt her parents and sister.

287
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,880
There has been a constant barrage of falsehoods, half-truths, innuendo and conspiracy theories

288
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,360
since the day she died.

289
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,800
I realize this may sound like an exaggeration, unfortunately it is the verifiable truth.

290
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,440
Because of this I have struggled to move forward with my life.

291
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,160
The frequency, intensity, ugliness, and promulgation of these horrifying lies ever increases on

292
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
the internet.

293
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,720
These conspiracy theorists, including most recently the President of the United States,

294
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,340
continue to spread their bile and misinformation on your platform, disparaging the memory of

295
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,240
my wife and our marriage.

296
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,360
President Trump on Tuesday tweeted to his nearly 80 million followers alluding to the

297
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,000
repeatedly debunked falsehood that my wife was murdered by her boss, former US representative

298
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,360
Joe Scarborough.

299
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,520
And here's the three Trump tweets about it.

300
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,240
My request is simple, please delete these tweets.

301
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,880
I'm a research engineer and not a lawyer, but I have reviewed all of Twitter's rules

302
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,220
in terms of service.

303
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,240
The President's tweet that suggests Laurie was murdered, without any evidence and contrary

304
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,600
to the official autopsy, is a violation of Twitter's community rules in terms of service.

305
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,760
An ordinary user like me would be banished from the platform for such a tweet, but I

306
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,120
am only asking that the tweets be removed.

307
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,720
It seems like Trump has tweeted something that is not only false, but verifiably false,

308
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,520
potentially even slanderous.

309
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,400
And the author of this letter is right when he says that if it were anybody else, they

310
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,480
would be banned.

311
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,640
So what is the good solution here, because as far as I can see, every solution seems

312
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,760
to be bad.

313
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,240
We can continue with an unfair system, where Trump and some select others can say whatever

314
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,880
they like, while plebs get routinely banned for far less.

315
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,600
Maybe blue Twitter checkmarks with the right politics can go on saying anything that they

316
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,160
like, without any repercussions at all.

317
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,240
Maybe big name political figures like Trump can say things but have them put behind some

318
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,140
kind of a wall, if Twitter's Ministry of Truth judges them to be fake news.

319
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,000
And then maybe the rest of us just gets banned.

320
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,400
That's how it is right now, and it's blatantly unfair.

321
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,340
But what are the alternatives?

322
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,280
Should Twitter start cracking down more and banning everyone regardless of their social

323
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
status?

324
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,660
Should Trump actually have his tweets deleted or be kicked off the platform?

325
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,160
Because that begins to go against Supreme Court rulings.

326
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,120
The last alternative is to let everyone say everything, free for all, old internet style.

327
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,440
But this letter does prove that there actually is a little bit of a problem when it comes

328
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,160
to, say, conspiracy theorists.

329
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,440
Most of the time, conspiracy theories are just good fun.

330
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,440
You turn on YouTube, well not YouTube anymore, because they've all been banned off of it.

331
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,600
You turn on some kind of site somewhere, where people are talking about how the world's actually

332
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,520
flat, and they're wearing tinfoil hats, and it's like goofy crazy nonsense.

333
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,520
And really, only a minority of people are actually convinced by that stuff.

334
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,200
Most of the time, regular people watch that stuff just to get a good laugh out of it.

335
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,200
That's why the ancient aliens guy was a meme for so long.

336
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,880
Because it's fun to watch an idiot with a dumb theory spiral into madness before your

337
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,420
very eyes trying to explain all this nonsense.

338
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,340
People are entertained by the absurd, but you also have conspiracy theories like the

339
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,640
one that Trump peddled about this dead woman.

340
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,100
And that will always be the fundamental problem with free speech, is that sometimes you have

341
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,400
to countenance speech that is not only offensive to you, but is ridiculous, is very clearly

342
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
false.

343
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,640
But again, that's what being an adult is, figuring it out for yourself.

344
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,140
And even though that's not an ideal solution, it seems to be the best one we have.

345
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,140
What makes this all very interesting is that this is happening at the exact same time as

346
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,020
another report's coming out, that almost nobody's talking about.

347
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,260
Leonard French did a stream on it because he's a lawyer, he's like a lawyer YouTuber,

348
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,140
and if you want to go watch his stream, I highly recommend you do.

349
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,900
But this is section 512 of title 17.

350
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,260
This is specifically part of copyright law.

351
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:10,220
And this is basically a study commissioned by the US Copyright Office to investigate

352
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,060
how exactly YouTube abuses the DMCA.

353
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,960
And as you can see here, there's a part regarding section 512 safe harbors.

354
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,240
This is obviously not the same safe harbors as section 230.

355
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,040
This basically refers to why YouTube isn't held liable for copyright infringement when

356
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,840
its users upload copyrighted content to the platform.

357
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,840
It is a similar set of law, but it is different.

358
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,600
And it seems like social media is going to be coming under fire from that angle as well.

359
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,640
Because just like with section 230, they have also been abusing their safe harbor status

360
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
over here.

361
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,600
This is a very interesting read, but it is very long and very technical.

362
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,260
And like I said, I would recommend you go and watch Leonard French's stream on this

363
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,280
subject as he goes into this whole thing in depth.

364
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,260
But the important part for me is that this is coming at the exact same time as Trump

365
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,520
is beginning to bring the hammer down regarding section 230.

366
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,860
Basically, big tech has been abusing all of the various safe harbors it's been given.

367
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,580
It was given them so that they could grow freely and maintain their business models.

368
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,980
But now that they've created the monopolies that they have, they are exploiting their

369
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,620
status to directly punish people who use their platforms, all the while continuing to say

370
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,340
that it's vital to a free and open internet that they continue to do this and get off

371
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,800
scot-free with it.

372
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,220
And while it might sound great that the government's finally coming down on big tech and we're

373
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,740
finally going to see some kind of freedom from their tyranny, this is not necessarily

374
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,200
the good ending, guys.

375
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,180
Because while it's nightmarish and dystopian to have corporations deciding what is and

376
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,920
isn't free speech, do you really want the government stepping in and taking control?

377
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,100
Do you want a nationalized Twitter?

378
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,100
Because that's what Weibo is over in China.

379
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,180
On their isolated internet, they have their own social media platforms, directly controlled

380
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,380
by the government, and they regulate what people can and can't say.

381
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,320
While corporate tyranny is alive and real, so is government tyranny.

382
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,500
And if we have to use the government to step in and bring us free speech again, we also

383
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,740
have to make sure they don't overstep their bounds.

384
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:21,700
Because we can very easily stumble into a place where we have, say, a nationalized Twitter,

385
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,700
or a nationalized internet, a department of propaganda, where the only truth you can publish

386
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,660
online is the truth that the current government allows you to publish.

387
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,980
That would be just as bad as what we currently have.

388
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,280
The ideal solution to all of this is that big tech stops shitting the bed, stops ruining

389
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,100
it for everyone else, and actually pulls their heads out of their asses.

390
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,940
But they seem to want to be the moral arbiters of what is right and wrong for every single

391
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,900
person that currently exists.

392
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,100
I don't want an internet where a handful of CEOs decides what the truth is.

393
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,020
Decides what you're allowed to post.

394
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,420
Decides what you're allowed to think and feel.

395
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,500
Decides what's offensive or not.

396
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,020
But I also don't want an internet where the American government decides that as well.

397
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,980
That is for people to decide.

398
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,580
If that means that sometimes misinformation gets through.

399
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,640
Sometimes you see conspiracy theories on your feed.

400
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,700
Sometimes somebody calls you a nasty name and you have to block them, fine.

401
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,700
So be it.

402
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,700
We're adults.

403
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,620
We can make decisions for ourselves.

404
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,860
I'm tired of having my hand held every single time I open up my browser.
