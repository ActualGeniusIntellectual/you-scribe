0	4140	I never thought that I'd have to wake up one day and wonder if my entire website was
4140	10660	going to be unplugged because of an opinion that I expressed.
10660	15300	Social media's been censoring everyone, not just conservatives, for a long time now.
15300	19340	It ramped up after Trump and Brexit because the neoliberal establishment wasn't used
19340	20780	to losing elections.
20780	26940	Everyone, from the alt-right to the communists, neo-nazis, radical leftists, even libertarians,
26940	32820	centrists, classical liberals, anyone who wasn't entirely safe and sanitized and family-friendly
32820	38040	eventually, for one reason or another, saw the long arm of censorship come for them.
38040	43020	The behaviours of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other big tech companies on this matter
43020	47540	goes entirely against the spirit, if not the letter, of current legislation.
47540	53800	Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act basically made the modern internet.
53800	58640	It allowed platforms, like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, to not be held legally liable
58640	63480	for the content their users post, if they make good faith attempts to moderate that
63480	65120	content in an unbiased manner.
65120	69580	And I hate to break it to all the idealists listening in here, but free speech was not
69580	72400	the only reason this law was put into place.
72400	77160	American supremacy in the tech-cultural sphere would absolutely fall behind the rest of the
77160	82300	world if all of the fledgling startups were squashed by thousands of lawsuits due to edgy
82300	84460	shitposts made on their services.
84460	88940	And it was these safe harbour protections that made the early internet so great.
88940	90900	Yes, it was the wild west.
90900	93720	Yes, people flung shit, all the time.
93720	98820	But there was rapid growth, there was expansion, there were new ideas being passed around.
98820	104460	People were figuring things out for themselves, largely unshackled by any kind of larger authority.
104460	107860	It was the wet dream of anybody who values digital freedom.
107860	112140	But slowly, as time went on, the people who ran these companies, like Mark Zuckerberg
112140	117220	and Jack Dorsey and others, they went from being free-speech entrepreneur-libertarian
117220	122700	types in their mid-twenties, to grouchy, wokes-gold millennials in their mid-thirties.
122700	127340	And slowly over time this began to reflect in the way those platforms were moderated.
127340	132020	Safety became more important to them than freedom, so bit by bit free speech was chipped
132020	134900	away from all sides, left, right, doesn't matter.
134940	139300	And when you finally arrive here, in 2020, they are routinely banning speech that is
139300	141940	explicitly allowed under the first amendment.
141940	146260	And when they began doing that, they became editors of content, not neutral platforms.
146260	148100	And Trump's finally had enough.
148100	154980	The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist, shadow, ban,
154980	158620	are editorial decisions, pure and simple, they're editorial decisions.
158620	164380	In those moments, Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform and they become an editor
164380	168700	with a viewpoint, and I think we can say that about others also, whether you're looking
168700	173340	at Google, whether you're looking at Facebook, and perhaps others.
173340	177100	He wants to bring the government hammer down on them for this, and I don't blame him.
177100	182300	You would find it entirely unacceptable if, say, your phone provider read your texts or
182300	185940	listened to your calls, decided that you had said something that wasn't illegal but a
185940	189980	bit too edgy for their CEO's liking, and cut your phone service off.
189980	192820	That is exactly what social media is doing right now.
192820	196500	So Trump decided to put out an executive order on this topic.
196500	198580	An executive order isn't legislation.
198580	201700	He can't change existing law using an executive order.
201700	205020	He can push Republicans in the House to start putting forward legislation, but he can't
205020	207400	unilaterally just change the law himself.
207400	211700	An executive order is more like a declaration from the current administration on how they
211700	215760	plan to interpret existing law and how they plan to enforce it.
215760	219080	For example, Obama did a very similar thing with the Dreamers.
219080	223280	That was entirely executive order, and it basically amounted to him announcing that
223280	228620	enforcing certain parts of current immigration law would simply not be a high priority for
228620	233280	his administration, even though those exact laws weren't technically off the books at
233280	234280	the time.
234280	238480	So the executive order is titled Preventing Online Censorship, and if you want to read
238480	241320	the full thing, it's very easy to find online.
241320	242880	But here's the juicy bits.
242880	248840	The emergence and growth of online platforms in recent years raises important questions
248840	253720	about applying the ideals of the First Amendment to modern communications technology.
253720	258420	Today, many Americans follow the news, stay in touch with friends and family, and share
258420	263200	their views on current events through social media and other online platforms.
263200	269400	As a result, these platforms function in many ways as a 21st century equivalent of the public
269400	270400	square.
270400	275680	We cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to handpick the speech that Americans
275680	278480	may access and convey online.
278480	282560	This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.
282560	287520	When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree,
287520	290000	they exercise dangerous power.
290000	295000	Social media platforms are invoking inconsistent, irrational, and groundless justifications
295000	300900	to censor or otherwise punish American speech here at home, meanwhile several online platforms
300900	306700	are profiting from and promoting the aggression and disinformation spread by foreign governments
306700	307880	like China.
307880	312680	My commitment to free and open debate on the internet remains as strong as ever.
312680	317480	Therefore, it remains the policy of the United States that lawful content should be free
317480	321080	from censorship in our digital marketplace of ideas.
321080	326040	As a nation, we must foster and protect diverse viewpoints in today's digital communications
326040	330480	environment where all Americans can and should have a voice.
330480	336000	We must seek transparency and accountability from online platforms, and encourage standards
336000	341040	and tools to protect and preserve the integrity and openness of American discourse and freedom
341040	342280	of expression.
342280	346040	And here's where we talk about Section 230, it is the policy of the United States to foster
346040	351360	clear, non-discriminatory ground rules promoting free and open debate on the internet.
351360	356960	Promen among these rules is the immunity from liability created by Section 230C of the Communications
356960	358200	Decency Act.
358200	363600	It is the policy of the United States that the scope of that immunity should be clarified.
363600	368640	When an interactive computer service provider removes or restricts access to content and
368640	375560	its actions do not meet the criteria of Sub-Paragraph C2A of Section 230 of the Communications Decency
375560	378800	Act, it is engaged in editorial conduct.
378800	384220	By making itself an editor of content outside the protections of Sub-Paragraph C2A, such
384220	390020	a provider forfeits any protection from being deemed a publisher or speaker under Sub-Section
390020	396500	230C1, which properly applies only to a provider that merely provides a platform for content
396500	398460	supplied by others.
398460	403100	It is the policy of the United States that all departments and agencies should apply
403100	408760	Section 230C according to the interpretation set out in this section.
408760	413580	To further advance the policy described in Sub-Section A of this section, within 30 days
413580	418200	of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, through the National Telecommunications
418200	422880	and Information Administration, shall file a petition for rulemaking with the Federal
422880	428080	Communications Commission requesting that the FCC expeditiously propose regulations
428080	433840	to clarify the conditions under which an action restricting access to or availability of material
433840	438560	is not taken in good faith, particularly the conditions under which such actions will be
438560	442720	considered to be either deceptive, pretextual, or inconsistent with the provider's terms
442720	448160	of service, or the result of inadequate notice, the product of unreasoned explanation, or
448160	452080	having been undertaken without a meaningful opportunity to be heard.
452080	457480	And any other proposed regulations that the NTIA concludes may be appropriate to advance
457480	460680	the policy described in Sub-Section A of this section.
460680	465360	Long story short, Trump is going after their safe harbor exemptions.
465360	468840	Now strangely enough, Twitter and Facebook are actually at cross-purposes regarding this
468840	469840	whole thing.
469840	474160	Facebook and Twitter clash over fact-checking as Trump threats intensify.
474160	477240	For years, Twitter and Facebook have enjoyed a healthy rivalry.
477320	481600	They've competed for acquisitions, talent, and advertising dollars, and sometimes gone
481600	484760	so far as to copy each other's features in the never-ending pursuit to grow their
484760	485760	audiences.
485760	489320	But the clash between the two tech companies appeared to take on new life this week after
489320	494000	Twitter's decision to place fact-check labels on some of President Donald Trump's tweets
494000	497800	sparked a series of threats, including an imminent executive order regulating social
497800	498880	media companies.
498880	502360	The CEOs of the two companies traded criticisms in public.
502360	506580	Former employees posted their own jabs on social media, and some legislators were quick
506620	510140	to highlight the differences between the approach Twitter and Facebook took, potentially only
510140	511140	adding to the tensions.
511140	515280	"'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,' Facebook co-founder
515280	518100	and CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Fox News.
518100	522740	I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that
522740	524420	people say online."
524420	529500	Hours later, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey appeared to push back at the assertion, saying that
529500	533820	labeling the tweets with fact-checks does not make the social media company an arbiter
533820	534820	of truth.
535060	539420	Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute
539420	541180	so people can judge for themselves.
541180	544980	The problem with Jack's explanation is that he's not doing it universally to everyone.
544980	546780	He doesn't even have the manpower to do that.
546780	549900	It's very clearly politically motivated who Twitter is targeting.
549900	554900	Yes, adding a header saying that this tweet might be fake news under a tweet that might
554900	557460	actually be fake news is the truth.
557460	562580	But if you only do it to a select number of accounts, and leave alone all the many millions
562580	566740	of other accounts that are also peddling fake news, then you have a serious problem
566740	570260	and it's not the fact that you're lying, it's the fact that you're only selectively telling
570260	571260	the truth.
571260	574860	It's very easy to cherry-pick which stories you want to cover, which messages you want
574860	579300	to label, where and when rules are going to be enforced, such that you're not actually
579300	582460	lying to anybody but you're still acting like a scumbag.
582460	586580	And don't think that I'm siding with everybody's favourite synth Zuckerberg on this either.
586580	589700	While it's admirable that he still believes that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of
589700	594980	truth of everything people say online, Facebook still routinely bans literally everyone for
594980	596480	nearly anything.
596480	600800	But of course because Zuckerberg, if only in speech and not in action, doesn't want
600800	606340	Facebook to be censoring everyone, the hashtag deletefacebook began briefly trending.
606340	608260	Look at all of these brainlets.
608260	613060	They are actually complaining that Facebook will not shut down speech they disapprove
613060	614060	of.
614060	615060	It's incredible.
615060	619500	Stop looking to authority figures, whether they're corporate or government or whatever,
619500	621480	to regulate your life for you.
621480	626860	It is your responsibility as an adult to take in all sources of information and try to synthesize
626860	627860	the truth.
627860	631060	Yes, that does mean you can't go through life on autopilot.
631060	632980	Welcome to not being an NPC.
632980	634940	I mean it's funny reading some of these, dude.
634940	639500	People are like posting Mark Zuckerberg killed Epstein, Mark Zuckerberg killed himself.
639500	643900	You know, obvious shitposts and being like, this is why Facebook needs to fact check every
643900	644900	single thing.
644900	645980	No, it's not.
645980	646980	That's just like stupid.
646980	647980	It's funny.
647980	652340	The best parts of the internet are still primarily places to fuck around and talk shit.
652340	656980	If you want to make a shitpost that says Mark Zuckerberg drinks bleach to try and cure the
656980	660940	coronavirus or something, I think you should be able to go ahead.
660940	662500	It's stupid fun, man.
662500	664140	Have you guys forgotten what fun is?
664140	668900	Oh, also, if you Gen Z brainlets are actually serious about this, you know that means you're
668900	671040	gonna have to stop using Instagram, right?
671040	672980	Since Facebook owns Instagram?
672980	674980	Though I have a feeling that's probably not gonna happen.
674980	678140	Y'all are way too addicted to your influencers or whatever.
678140	679140	I don't know.
679140	680140	I don't know what's going on over there.
680140	681140	I'm an old man at this point.
681140	683580	Take your executive order and shove it, Trump.
683580	686700	We're gonna keep telling the truth about you on Twitter and everywhere else.
686700	687700	Get used to it.
687700	688700	That's okay, man.
688700	690940	Like, seriously, I don't think this is aimed at you.
690940	693820	In fact, this is allowing you to do this.
693820	698660	Like imagine if there was a big shakeup over in the offices of all the various big tech
698660	702340	firms, all the social media companies, and a whole bunch of people on the extreme right
702340	705780	suddenly found themselves running those companies somehow.
705780	711260	Enforcing political neutrality on these companies would allow people like you to continue to
711260	715440	use those platforms to criticize Trump and other Republicans, and that's exactly how
715440	716440	it should be.
716440	721700	I think he's doing this to ensure that everyone has free speech, both you and people who disagree
721700	722700	with you.
722700	725120	And you know, maybe that's your problem with it.
725120	730640	Another trending hashtag that came about maybe a day or two later was hashtag Donald is over
730640	731640	democracy.
731640	736440	And it is very similar to the previous one in that it's just basically a whole bunch
736440	742400	of people who are celebrating the fact that when Trump tweeted about the current Minneapolis
742400	747480	riots, which I'm sure I will have to do a video on at a later date, but when Trump tweeted
747480	752220	about them, Twitter hid one of his tweets, said that it glorified violence, but still
752220	755220	allowed you to read it because, hey, he's the president.
755220	759520	But I guess there's a whole bunch of people that consider this to be like a giant own
759520	760520	or something.
760520	765220	So they're just going wild like, lol, Twitter put a thing on Trump's tweet.
765220	766220	Look at the loser.
766220	768360	He's still the president.
768360	771460	Do you think the internet points actually mean anything, man?
771460	776080	Do you think that Twitter's authority supersedes the authority of the president of the United
776080	777080	States?
777080	778960	And here's the tweet that caused the stir.
778960	783920	I can't stand back and watch this happen to a great American city, Minneapolis, a total
783920	784920	lack of leadership.
784920	790300	Either the very weak radical left mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the city
790300	794500	under control, or I will send in the National Guard and get the job done right.
794500	799020	Then the second tweet was blocked and had this message put over top of it.
799020	802740	This tweet violated the Twitter rules about glorifying violence.
802740	806060	However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the tweet
806060	807520	to remain accessible.
807520	812660	The blocked tweet says, these thugs are dishonouring the memory of George Floyd and I won't let
812660	813820	that happen.
813820	818040	Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the military is with him all the way.
818040	821880	Any difficulty and we will assume control, but when the looting starts, the shooting
821880	822880	starts.
822880	823880	Thank you.
823880	826400	Now to me this doesn't seem like glorifying violence.
826400	831320	To me this just seems like Trump warning the mayor of Minneapolis to stop hamstringing
831320	835400	his own police force and have them step in and take control.
835400	838740	Because and like I said earlier, I will get into this in a different video, currently
838740	843200	what's going on in Minneapolis has nothing to do with the absolute injustice that is
843200	849960	the murder of George Floyd by a police officer and has everything to do with thugs, yes thugs,
849960	851580	rioting and looting.
851580	853600	But Twitter thinks this tweet is unacceptable.
853600	857460	While it's behind this message, it can't be liked or retweeted.
857460	862440	It can still be viewed and it's not deleted, presumably because as per the Supreme Court's
862440	865960	orders, the president's Twitter account is a matter of public record.
865960	871040	But I bet if this were anybody else, at least anybody else with this political persuasion,
871040	872040	this would be deleted.
872280	877240	We know this because Olivia Gatwood's take of burn it down, fuck property, fuck cops
877240	883000	is only currently offline not because Twitter deleted it, but because she deleted it after
883000	886920	everyone came down on her for such a terrible, awful take.
886920	891640	When people on the radical left advocate for violence in the name of their politics, it's
891640	896700	punching up, it's attacking people who have systemic power and privilege, and so it's
896700	898860	not glorifying violence.
898860	904940	But when President Trump says, hey, maybe restore law and order in your burning city
904940	909660	or else the feds will have to come in and handle it, apparently that's glorifying
909660	910780	violence.
910780	913900	There is obviously a political bias at play here.
913900	918140	The best part about this whole thing is that Jack Dorsey himself seems to want to go to
918140	920260	war against Trump over this.
920260	924620	Twitter comms started a thread where they talked about the public interest notice they
924620	928340	placed on Donald Trump's Twitter account and why they did it.
928340	932140	And then Jack retweeted that from his personal account.
932140	936820	Geez, it seems like he's openly picking a fight with Trump at this point.
936820	939020	I hope he's secure in his position.
939020	943500	But let's be honest here guys, the President isn't innocent himself.
943500	949000	Here is one of many morons who wants things to go even further in the other direction,
949000	950500	away from free speech.
950500	954220	Dear Jack Dorsey, delete these ugly tweets, they're vicious lies.
954220	958660	You must cleanse Twitter of this Trump stain, if not of Trump himself.
958660	963180	Sincerely, Tribelaw, a Twitter user who couldn't get away even once with what Trump gets away
963180	964220	with daily.
964220	965620	They want him banned.
965620	970660	They don't want the rules changed such that everyone can talk like Trump does.
970660	975780	They want the rules enforced on Trump and he be removed from Twitter entirely.
975780	981460	The article linked in this tweet covers an event that happened three or four days ago
981460	986340	where Trump was tweeting legitimately false information, I'm pretty sure, about the
986340	989220	death of Lori K. Closetus.
989220	990700	And here's one of those tweets.
990700	996420	Comcast should open up a long overdue Florida cold case against Psycho Joe Scarborough.
996420	1001420	I know him and Crazy Mika well, used them beautifully in the last election, dumped them
1001420	1004660	nicely and will state on the record that he is nuts.
1004660	1006540	Besides bad ratings.
1006540	1008880	This is a very strange tweet guys.
1008880	1013080	These tweets are in reference to the death of Lori K. Closetus, which was at the time
1013080	1017920	nearly 20 years ago, suspected to be a murder, but later it came out that it was probably
1017920	1018920	just an accident.
1018920	1022240	However, Trump's here talking about it like it's a cold case.
1022240	1025500	Here is a letter sent from her husband to Jack Dorsey.
1025500	1030600	Nearly 19 years ago, my wife, who had an undiagnosed heart condition, fell and hit her head on
1030600	1032520	her desk at work.
1032520	1035080	She was found dead the next morning.
1035080	1039000	Her name is Lori K. Closetus and she was 28 years old when she died.
1039000	1044360	Her passing is the single most painful thing that I have ever had to deal with in my 52
1044360	1047440	years and continues to haunt her parents and sister.
1047440	1051880	There has been a constant barrage of falsehoods, half-truths, innuendo and conspiracy theories
1051880	1053360	since the day she died.
1053360	1058800	I realize this may sound like an exaggeration, unfortunately it is the verifiable truth.
1058800	1061440	Because of this I have struggled to move forward with my life.
1061440	1066160	The frequency, intensity, ugliness, and promulgation of these horrifying lies ever increases on
1066160	1067160	the internet.
1067160	1071720	These conspiracy theorists, including most recently the President of the United States,
1071720	1076340	continue to spread their bile and misinformation on your platform, disparaging the memory of
1076340	1078240	my wife and our marriage.
1078240	1082360	President Trump on Tuesday tweeted to his nearly 80 million followers alluding to the
1082360	1088000	repeatedly debunked falsehood that my wife was murdered by her boss, former US representative
1088000	1089360	Joe Scarborough.
1089360	1091520	And here's the three Trump tweets about it.
1091520	1094240	My request is simple, please delete these tweets.
1094240	1097880	I'm a research engineer and not a lawyer, but I have reviewed all of Twitter's rules
1097880	1099220	in terms of service.
1099220	1103240	The President's tweet that suggests Laurie was murdered, without any evidence and contrary
1103240	1108600	to the official autopsy, is a violation of Twitter's community rules in terms of service.
1108600	1112760	An ordinary user like me would be banished from the platform for such a tweet, but I
1112760	1115120	am only asking that the tweets be removed.
1115120	1120720	It seems like Trump has tweeted something that is not only false, but verifiably false,
1120720	1122520	potentially even slanderous.
1122520	1127400	And the author of this letter is right when he says that if it were anybody else, they
1127400	1128480	would be banned.
1128480	1132640	So what is the good solution here, because as far as I can see, every solution seems
1132640	1133760	to be bad.
1133760	1138240	We can continue with an unfair system, where Trump and some select others can say whatever
1138240	1141880	they like, while plebs get routinely banned for far less.
1141880	1146600	Maybe blue Twitter checkmarks with the right politics can go on saying anything that they
1146600	1149160	like, without any repercussions at all.
1149160	1154240	Maybe big name political figures like Trump can say things but have them put behind some
1154240	1159140	kind of a wall, if Twitter's Ministry of Truth judges them to be fake news.
1159140	1161000	And then maybe the rest of us just gets banned.
1161000	1164400	That's how it is right now, and it's blatantly unfair.
1164400	1166340	But what are the alternatives?
1166340	1170280	Should Twitter start cracking down more and banning everyone regardless of their social
1170280	1171280	status?
1171280	1174660	Should Trump actually have his tweets deleted or be kicked off the platform?
1174660	1177160	Because that begins to go against Supreme Court rulings.
1177160	1182120	The last alternative is to let everyone say everything, free for all, old internet style.
1182120	1186440	But this letter does prove that there actually is a little bit of a problem when it comes
1186440	1189160	to, say, conspiracy theorists.
1189160	1191440	Most of the time, conspiracy theories are just good fun.
1191440	1194440	You turn on YouTube, well not YouTube anymore, because they've all been banned off of it.
1194440	1198600	You turn on some kind of site somewhere, where people are talking about how the world's actually
1198600	1202520	flat, and they're wearing tinfoil hats, and it's like goofy crazy nonsense.
1202520	1205520	And really, only a minority of people are actually convinced by that stuff.
1205520	1209200	Most of the time, regular people watch that stuff just to get a good laugh out of it.
1209200	1212200	That's why the ancient aliens guy was a meme for so long.
1212200	1215880	Because it's fun to watch an idiot with a dumb theory spiral into madness before your
1215880	1218420	very eyes trying to explain all this nonsense.
1218420	1222340	People are entertained by the absurd, but you also have conspiracy theories like the
1222340	1224640	one that Trump peddled about this dead woman.
1224640	1228100	And that will always be the fundamental problem with free speech, is that sometimes you have
1228100	1234400	to countenance speech that is not only offensive to you, but is ridiculous, is very clearly
1234400	1235400	false.
1235400	1239640	But again, that's what being an adult is, figuring it out for yourself.
1239640	1244140	And even though that's not an ideal solution, it seems to be the best one we have.
1244140	1249140	What makes this all very interesting is that this is happening at the exact same time as
1249140	1253020	another report's coming out, that almost nobody's talking about.
1253020	1256260	Leonard French did a stream on it because he's a lawyer, he's like a lawyer YouTuber,
1256260	1259140	and if you want to go watch his stream, I highly recommend you do.
1259140	1262900	But this is section 512 of title 17.
1262900	1265260	This is specifically part of copyright law.
1265260	1270220	And this is basically a study commissioned by the US Copyright Office to investigate
1270220	1274060	how exactly YouTube abuses the DMCA.
1274060	1277960	And as you can see here, there's a part regarding section 512 safe harbors.
1277960	1281240	This is obviously not the same safe harbors as section 230.
1281240	1287040	This basically refers to why YouTube isn't held liable for copyright infringement when
1287040	1290840	its users upload copyrighted content to the platform.
1290840	1293840	It is a similar set of law, but it is different.
1293840	1298600	And it seems like social media is going to be coming under fire from that angle as well.
1298600	1303640	Because just like with section 230, they have also been abusing their safe harbor status
1303640	1304640	over here.
1304640	1308600	This is a very interesting read, but it is very long and very technical.
1308600	1313260	And like I said, I would recommend you go and watch Leonard French's stream on this
1313260	1317280	subject as he goes into this whole thing in depth.
1317280	1322260	But the important part for me is that this is coming at the exact same time as Trump
1322260	1325520	is beginning to bring the hammer down regarding section 230.
1325520	1331860	Basically, big tech has been abusing all of the various safe harbors it's been given.
1331860	1336580	It was given them so that they could grow freely and maintain their business models.
1336580	1339980	But now that they've created the monopolies that they have, they are exploiting their
1339980	1344620	status to directly punish people who use their platforms, all the while continuing to say
1344620	1349340	that it's vital to a free and open internet that they continue to do this and get off
1349340	1350800	scot-free with it.
1350800	1355220	And while it might sound great that the government's finally coming down on big tech and we're
1355220	1359740	finally going to see some kind of freedom from their tyranny, this is not necessarily
1359740	1361200	the good ending, guys.
1361200	1366180	Because while it's nightmarish and dystopian to have corporations deciding what is and
1366180	1370920	isn't free speech, do you really want the government stepping in and taking control?
1370920	1373100	Do you want a nationalized Twitter?
1373100	1375100	Because that's what Weibo is over in China.
1375100	1379180	On their isolated internet, they have their own social media platforms, directly controlled
1379180	1382380	by the government, and they regulate what people can and can't say.
1382380	1387320	While corporate tyranny is alive and real, so is government tyranny.
1387320	1392500	And if we have to use the government to step in and bring us free speech again, we also
1392500	1395740	have to make sure they don't overstep their bounds.
1395740	1401700	Because we can very easily stumble into a place where we have, say, a nationalized Twitter,
1401700	1406700	or a nationalized internet, a department of propaganda, where the only truth you can publish
1406700	1410660	online is the truth that the current government allows you to publish.
1410660	1412980	That would be just as bad as what we currently have.
1412980	1418280	The ideal solution to all of this is that big tech stops shitting the bed, stops ruining
1418280	1422100	it for everyone else, and actually pulls their heads out of their asses.
1422100	1426940	But they seem to want to be the moral arbiters of what is right and wrong for every single
1426940	1428900	person that currently exists.
1428900	1434100	I don't want an internet where a handful of CEOs decides what the truth is.
1434100	1436020	Decides what you're allowed to post.
1436020	1438420	Decides what you're allowed to think and feel.
1438420	1440500	Decides what's offensive or not.
1440500	1445020	But I also don't want an internet where the American government decides that as well.
1445020	1446980	That is for people to decide.
1446980	1451580	If that means that sometimes misinformation gets through.
1451580	1454640	Sometimes you see conspiracy theories on your feed.
1454640	1459700	Sometimes somebody calls you a nasty name and you have to block them, fine.
1459700	1460700	So be it.
1460700	1461700	We're adults.
1461700	1463620	We can make decisions for ourselves.
1463620	1467860	I'm tired of having my hand held every single time I open up my browser.
