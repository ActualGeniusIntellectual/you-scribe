WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.140
I never thought that I'd have to wake up one day and wonder if my entire website was

00:04.140 --> 00:10.660
going to be unplugged because of an opinion that I expressed.

00:10.660 --> 00:15.300
Social media's been censoring everyone, not just conservatives, for a long time now.

00:15.300 --> 00:19.340
It ramped up after Trump and Brexit because the neoliberal establishment wasn't used

00:19.340 --> 00:20.780
to losing elections.

00:20.780 --> 00:26.940
Everyone, from the alt-right to the communists, neo-nazis, radical leftists, even libertarians,

00:26.940 --> 00:32.820
centrists, classical liberals, anyone who wasn't entirely safe and sanitized and family-friendly

00:32.820 --> 00:38.040
eventually, for one reason or another, saw the long arm of censorship come for them.

00:38.040 --> 00:43.020
The behaviours of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other big tech companies on this matter

00:43.020 --> 00:47.540
goes entirely against the spirit, if not the letter, of current legislation.

00:47.540 --> 00:53.800
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act basically made the modern internet.

00:53.800 --> 00:58.640
It allowed platforms, like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, to not be held legally liable

00:58.640 --> 01:03.480
for the content their users post, if they make good faith attempts to moderate that

01:03.480 --> 01:05.120
content in an unbiased manner.

01:05.120 --> 01:09.580
And I hate to break it to all the idealists listening in here, but free speech was not

01:09.580 --> 01:12.400
the only reason this law was put into place.

01:12.400 --> 01:17.160
American supremacy in the tech-cultural sphere would absolutely fall behind the rest of the

01:17.160 --> 01:22.300
world if all of the fledgling startups were squashed by thousands of lawsuits due to edgy

01:22.300 --> 01:24.460
shitposts made on their services.

01:24.460 --> 01:28.940
And it was these safe harbour protections that made the early internet so great.

01:28.940 --> 01:30.900
Yes, it was the wild west.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.720
Yes, people flung shit, all the time.

01:33.720 --> 01:38.820
But there was rapid growth, there was expansion, there were new ideas being passed around.

01:38.820 --> 01:44.460
People were figuring things out for themselves, largely unshackled by any kind of larger authority.

01:44.460 --> 01:47.860
It was the wet dream of anybody who values digital freedom.

01:47.860 --> 01:52.140
But slowly, as time went on, the people who ran these companies, like Mark Zuckerberg

01:52.140 --> 01:57.220
and Jack Dorsey and others, they went from being free-speech entrepreneur-libertarian

01:57.220 --> 02:02.700
types in their mid-twenties, to grouchy, wokes-gold millennials in their mid-thirties.

02:02.700 --> 02:07.340
And slowly over time this began to reflect in the way those platforms were moderated.

02:07.340 --> 02:12.020
Safety became more important to them than freedom, so bit by bit free speech was chipped

02:12.020 --> 02:14.900
away from all sides, left, right, doesn't matter.

02:14.940 --> 02:19.300
And when you finally arrive here, in 2020, they are routinely banning speech that is

02:19.300 --> 02:21.940
explicitly allowed under the first amendment.

02:21.940 --> 02:26.260
And when they began doing that, they became editors of content, not neutral platforms.

02:26.260 --> 02:28.100
And Trump's finally had enough.

02:28.100 --> 02:34.980
The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist, shadow, ban,

02:34.980 --> 02:38.620
are editorial decisions, pure and simple, they're editorial decisions.

02:38.620 --> 02:44.380
In those moments, Twitter ceases to be a neutral public platform and they become an editor

02:44.380 --> 02:48.700
with a viewpoint, and I think we can say that about others also, whether you're looking

02:48.700 --> 02:53.340
at Google, whether you're looking at Facebook, and perhaps others.

02:53.340 --> 02:57.100
He wants to bring the government hammer down on them for this, and I don't blame him.

02:57.100 --> 03:02.300
You would find it entirely unacceptable if, say, your phone provider read your texts or

03:02.300 --> 03:05.940
listened to your calls, decided that you had said something that wasn't illegal but a

03:05.940 --> 03:09.980
bit too edgy for their CEO's liking, and cut your phone service off.

03:09.980 --> 03:12.820
That is exactly what social media is doing right now.

03:12.820 --> 03:16.500
So Trump decided to put out an executive order on this topic.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.580
An executive order isn't legislation.

03:18.580 --> 03:21.700
He can't change existing law using an executive order.

03:21.700 --> 03:25.020
He can push Republicans in the House to start putting forward legislation, but he can't

03:25.020 --> 03:27.400
unilaterally just change the law himself.

03:27.400 --> 03:31.700
An executive order is more like a declaration from the current administration on how they

03:31.700 --> 03:35.760
plan to interpret existing law and how they plan to enforce it.

03:35.760 --> 03:39.080
For example, Obama did a very similar thing with the Dreamers.

03:39.080 --> 03:43.280
That was entirely executive order, and it basically amounted to him announcing that

03:43.280 --> 03:48.620
enforcing certain parts of current immigration law would simply not be a high priority for

03:48.620 --> 03:53.280
his administration, even though those exact laws weren't technically off the books at

03:53.280 --> 03:54.280
the time.

03:54.280 --> 03:58.480
So the executive order is titled Preventing Online Censorship, and if you want to read

03:58.480 --> 04:01.320
the full thing, it's very easy to find online.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.880
But here's the juicy bits.

04:02.880 --> 04:08.840
The emergence and growth of online platforms in recent years raises important questions

04:08.840 --> 04:13.720
about applying the ideals of the First Amendment to modern communications technology.

04:13.720 --> 04:18.420
Today, many Americans follow the news, stay in touch with friends and family, and share

04:18.420 --> 04:23.200
their views on current events through social media and other online platforms.

04:23.200 --> 04:29.400
As a result, these platforms function in many ways as a 21st century equivalent of the public

04:29.400 --> 04:30.400
square.

04:30.400 --> 04:35.680
We cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to handpick the speech that Americans

04:35.680 --> 04:38.480
may access and convey online.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.560
This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.

04:42.560 --> 04:47.520
When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree,

04:47.520 --> 04:50.000
they exercise dangerous power.

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
Social media platforms are invoking inconsistent, irrational, and groundless justifications

04:55.000 --> 05:00.900
to censor or otherwise punish American speech here at home, meanwhile several online platforms

05:00.900 --> 05:06.700
are profiting from and promoting the aggression and disinformation spread by foreign governments

05:06.700 --> 05:07.880
like China.

05:07.880 --> 05:12.680
My commitment to free and open debate on the internet remains as strong as ever.

05:12.680 --> 05:17.480
Therefore, it remains the policy of the United States that lawful content should be free

05:17.480 --> 05:21.080
from censorship in our digital marketplace of ideas.

05:21.080 --> 05:26.040
As a nation, we must foster and protect diverse viewpoints in today's digital communications

05:26.040 --> 05:30.480
environment where all Americans can and should have a voice.

05:30.480 --> 05:36.000
We must seek transparency and accountability from online platforms, and encourage standards

05:36.000 --> 05:41.040
and tools to protect and preserve the integrity and openness of American discourse and freedom

05:41.040 --> 05:42.280
of expression.

05:42.280 --> 05:46.040
And here's where we talk about Section 230, it is the policy of the United States to foster

05:46.040 --> 05:51.360
clear, non-discriminatory ground rules promoting free and open debate on the internet.

05:51.360 --> 05:56.960
Promen among these rules is the immunity from liability created by Section 230C of the Communications

05:56.960 --> 05:58.200
Decency Act.

05:58.200 --> 06:03.600
It is the policy of the United States that the scope of that immunity should be clarified.

06:03.600 --> 06:08.640
When an interactive computer service provider removes or restricts access to content and

06:08.640 --> 06:15.560
its actions do not meet the criteria of Sub-Paragraph C2A of Section 230 of the Communications Decency

06:15.560 --> 06:18.800
Act, it is engaged in editorial conduct.

06:18.800 --> 06:24.220
By making itself an editor of content outside the protections of Sub-Paragraph C2A, such

06:24.220 --> 06:30.020
a provider forfeits any protection from being deemed a publisher or speaker under Sub-Section

06:30.020 --> 06:36.500
230C1, which properly applies only to a provider that merely provides a platform for content

06:36.500 --> 06:38.460
supplied by others.

06:38.460 --> 06:43.100
It is the policy of the United States that all departments and agencies should apply

06:43.100 --> 06:48.760
Section 230C according to the interpretation set out in this section.

06:48.760 --> 06:53.580
To further advance the policy described in Sub-Section A of this section, within 30 days

06:53.580 --> 06:58.200
of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce, through the National Telecommunications

06:58.200 --> 07:02.880
and Information Administration, shall file a petition for rulemaking with the Federal

07:02.880 --> 07:08.080
Communications Commission requesting that the FCC expeditiously propose regulations

07:08.080 --> 07:13.840
to clarify the conditions under which an action restricting access to or availability of material

07:13.840 --> 07:18.560
is not taken in good faith, particularly the conditions under which such actions will be

07:18.560 --> 07:22.720
considered to be either deceptive, pretextual, or inconsistent with the provider's terms

07:22.720 --> 07:28.160
of service, or the result of inadequate notice, the product of unreasoned explanation, or

07:28.160 --> 07:32.080
having been undertaken without a meaningful opportunity to be heard.

07:32.080 --> 07:37.480
And any other proposed regulations that the NTIA concludes may be appropriate to advance

07:37.480 --> 07:40.680
the policy described in Sub-Section A of this section.

07:40.680 --> 07:45.360
Long story short, Trump is going after their safe harbor exemptions.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.840
Now strangely enough, Twitter and Facebook are actually at cross-purposes regarding this

07:48.840 --> 07:49.840
whole thing.

07:49.840 --> 07:54.160
Facebook and Twitter clash over fact-checking as Trump threats intensify.

07:54.160 --> 07:57.240
For years, Twitter and Facebook have enjoyed a healthy rivalry.

07:57.320 --> 08:01.600
They've competed for acquisitions, talent, and advertising dollars, and sometimes gone

08:01.600 --> 08:04.760
so far as to copy each other's features in the never-ending pursuit to grow their

08:04.760 --> 08:05.760
audiences.

08:05.760 --> 08:09.320
But the clash between the two tech companies appeared to take on new life this week after

08:09.320 --> 08:14.000
Twitter's decision to place fact-check labels on some of President Donald Trump's tweets

08:14.000 --> 08:17.800
sparked a series of threats, including an imminent executive order regulating social

08:17.800 --> 08:18.880
media companies.

08:18.880 --> 08:22.360
The CEOs of the two companies traded criticisms in public.

08:22.360 --> 08:26.580
Former employees posted their own jabs on social media, and some legislators were quick

08:26.620 --> 08:30.140
to highlight the differences between the approach Twitter and Facebook took, potentially only

08:30.140 --> 08:31.140
adding to the tensions.

08:31.140 --> 08:35.280
"'We have a different policy than, I think, Twitter on this,' Facebook co-founder

08:35.280 --> 08:38.100
and CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Fox News.

08:38.100 --> 08:42.740
I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that

08:42.740 --> 08:44.420
people say online."

08:44.420 --> 08:49.500
Hours later, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey appeared to push back at the assertion, saying that

08:49.500 --> 08:53.820
labeling the tweets with fact-checks does not make the social media company an arbiter

08:53.820 --> 08:54.820
of truth.

08:55.060 --> 08:59.420
Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute

08:59.420 --> 09:01.180
so people can judge for themselves.

09:01.180 --> 09:04.980
The problem with Jack's explanation is that he's not doing it universally to everyone.

09:04.980 --> 09:06.780
He doesn't even have the manpower to do that.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.900
It's very clearly politically motivated who Twitter is targeting.

09:09.900 --> 09:14.900
Yes, adding a header saying that this tweet might be fake news under a tweet that might

09:14.900 --> 09:17.460
actually be fake news is the truth.

09:17.460 --> 09:22.580
But if you only do it to a select number of accounts, and leave alone all the many millions

09:22.580 --> 09:26.740
of other accounts that are also peddling fake news, then you have a serious problem

09:26.740 --> 09:30.260
and it's not the fact that you're lying, it's the fact that you're only selectively telling

09:30.260 --> 09:31.260
the truth.

09:31.260 --> 09:34.860
It's very easy to cherry-pick which stories you want to cover, which messages you want

09:34.860 --> 09:39.300
to label, where and when rules are going to be enforced, such that you're not actually

09:39.300 --> 09:42.460
lying to anybody but you're still acting like a scumbag.

09:42.460 --> 09:46.580
And don't think that I'm siding with everybody's favourite synth Zuckerberg on this either.

09:46.580 --> 09:49.700
While it's admirable that he still believes that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of

09:49.700 --> 09:54.980
truth of everything people say online, Facebook still routinely bans literally everyone for

09:54.980 --> 09:56.480
nearly anything.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.800
But of course because Zuckerberg, if only in speech and not in action, doesn't want

10:00.800 --> 10:06.340
Facebook to be censoring everyone, the hashtag deletefacebook began briefly trending.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.260
Look at all of these brainlets.

10:08.260 --> 10:13.060
They are actually complaining that Facebook will not shut down speech they disapprove

10:13.060 --> 10:14.060
of.

10:14.060 --> 10:15.060
It's incredible.

10:15.060 --> 10:19.500
Stop looking to authority figures, whether they're corporate or government or whatever,

10:19.500 --> 10:21.480
to regulate your life for you.

10:21.480 --> 10:26.860
It is your responsibility as an adult to take in all sources of information and try to synthesize

10:26.860 --> 10:27.860
the truth.

10:27.860 --> 10:31.060
Yes, that does mean you can't go through life on autopilot.

10:31.060 --> 10:32.980
Welcome to not being an NPC.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.940
I mean it's funny reading some of these, dude.

10:34.940 --> 10:39.500
People are like posting Mark Zuckerberg killed Epstein, Mark Zuckerberg killed himself.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.900
You know, obvious shitposts and being like, this is why Facebook needs to fact check every

10:43.900 --> 10:44.900
single thing.

10:44.900 --> 10:45.980
No, it's not.

10:45.980 --> 10:46.980
That's just like stupid.

10:46.980 --> 10:47.980
It's funny.

10:47.980 --> 10:52.340
The best parts of the internet are still primarily places to fuck around and talk shit.

10:52.340 --> 10:56.980
If you want to make a shitpost that says Mark Zuckerberg drinks bleach to try and cure the

10:56.980 --> 11:00.940
coronavirus or something, I think you should be able to go ahead.

11:00.940 --> 11:02.500
It's stupid fun, man.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.140
Have you guys forgotten what fun is?

11:04.140 --> 11:08.900
Oh, also, if you Gen Z brainlets are actually serious about this, you know that means you're

11:08.900 --> 11:11.040
gonna have to stop using Instagram, right?

11:11.040 --> 11:12.980
Since Facebook owns Instagram?

11:12.980 --> 11:14.980
Though I have a feeling that's probably not gonna happen.

11:14.980 --> 11:18.140
Y'all are way too addicted to your influencers or whatever.

11:18.140 --> 11:19.140
I don't know.

11:19.140 --> 11:20.140
I don't know what's going on over there.

11:20.140 --> 11:21.140
I'm an old man at this point.

11:21.140 --> 11:23.580
Take your executive order and shove it, Trump.

11:23.580 --> 11:26.700
We're gonna keep telling the truth about you on Twitter and everywhere else.

11:26.700 --> 11:27.700
Get used to it.

11:27.700 --> 11:28.700
That's okay, man.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.940
Like, seriously, I don't think this is aimed at you.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.820
In fact, this is allowing you to do this.

11:33.820 --> 11:38.660
Like imagine if there was a big shakeup over in the offices of all the various big tech

11:38.660 --> 11:42.340
firms, all the social media companies, and a whole bunch of people on the extreme right

11:42.340 --> 11:45.780
suddenly found themselves running those companies somehow.

11:45.780 --> 11:51.260
Enforcing political neutrality on these companies would allow people like you to continue to

11:51.260 --> 11:55.440
use those platforms to criticize Trump and other Republicans, and that's exactly how

11:55.440 --> 11:56.440
it should be.

11:56.440 --> 12:01.700
I think he's doing this to ensure that everyone has free speech, both you and people who disagree

12:01.700 --> 12:02.700
with you.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.120
And you know, maybe that's your problem with it.

12:05.120 --> 12:10.640
Another trending hashtag that came about maybe a day or two later was hashtag Donald is over

12:10.640 --> 12:11.640
democracy.

12:11.640 --> 12:16.440
And it is very similar to the previous one in that it's just basically a whole bunch

12:16.440 --> 12:22.400
of people who are celebrating the fact that when Trump tweeted about the current Minneapolis

12:22.400 --> 12:27.480
riots, which I'm sure I will have to do a video on at a later date, but when Trump tweeted

12:27.480 --> 12:32.220
about them, Twitter hid one of his tweets, said that it glorified violence, but still

12:32.220 --> 12:35.220
allowed you to read it because, hey, he's the president.

12:35.220 --> 12:39.520
But I guess there's a whole bunch of people that consider this to be like a giant own

12:39.520 --> 12:40.520
or something.

12:40.520 --> 12:45.220
So they're just going wild like, lol, Twitter put a thing on Trump's tweet.

12:45.220 --> 12:46.220
Look at the loser.

12:46.220 --> 12:48.360
He's still the president.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.460
Do you think the internet points actually mean anything, man?

12:51.460 --> 12:56.080
Do you think that Twitter's authority supersedes the authority of the president of the United

12:56.080 --> 12:57.080
States?

12:57.080 --> 12:58.960
And here's the tweet that caused the stir.

12:58.960 --> 13:03.920
I can't stand back and watch this happen to a great American city, Minneapolis, a total

13:03.920 --> 13:04.920
lack of leadership.

13:04.920 --> 13:10.300
Either the very weak radical left mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the city

13:10.300 --> 13:14.500
under control, or I will send in the National Guard and get the job done right.

13:14.500 --> 13:19.020
Then the second tweet was blocked and had this message put over top of it.

13:19.020 --> 13:22.740
This tweet violated the Twitter rules about glorifying violence.

13:22.740 --> 13:26.060
However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the tweet

13:26.060 --> 13:27.520
to remain accessible.

13:27.520 --> 13:32.660
The blocked tweet says, these thugs are dishonouring the memory of George Floyd and I won't let

13:32.660 --> 13:33.820
that happen.

13:33.820 --> 13:38.040
Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the military is with him all the way.

13:38.040 --> 13:41.880
Any difficulty and we will assume control, but when the looting starts, the shooting

13:41.880 --> 13:42.880
starts.

13:42.880 --> 13:43.880
Thank you.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.400
Now to me this doesn't seem like glorifying violence.

13:46.400 --> 13:51.320
To me this just seems like Trump warning the mayor of Minneapolis to stop hamstringing

13:51.320 --> 13:55.400
his own police force and have them step in and take control.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.740
Because and like I said earlier, I will get into this in a different video, currently

13:58.740 --> 14:03.200
what's going on in Minneapolis has nothing to do with the absolute injustice that is

14:03.200 --> 14:09.960
the murder of George Floyd by a police officer and has everything to do with thugs, yes thugs,

14:09.960 --> 14:11.580
rioting and looting.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.600
But Twitter thinks this tweet is unacceptable.

14:13.600 --> 14:17.460
While it's behind this message, it can't be liked or retweeted.

14:17.460 --> 14:22.440
It can still be viewed and it's not deleted, presumably because as per the Supreme Court's

14:22.440 --> 14:25.960
orders, the president's Twitter account is a matter of public record.

14:25.960 --> 14:31.040
But I bet if this were anybody else, at least anybody else with this political persuasion,

14:31.040 --> 14:32.040
this would be deleted.

14:32.280 --> 14:37.240
We know this because Olivia Gatwood's take of burn it down, fuck property, fuck cops

14:37.240 --> 14:43.000
is only currently offline not because Twitter deleted it, but because she deleted it after

14:43.000 --> 14:46.920
everyone came down on her for such a terrible, awful take.

14:46.920 --> 14:51.640
When people on the radical left advocate for violence in the name of their politics, it's

14:51.640 --> 14:56.700
punching up, it's attacking people who have systemic power and privilege, and so it's

14:56.700 --> 14:58.860
not glorifying violence.

14:58.860 --> 15:04.940
But when President Trump says, hey, maybe restore law and order in your burning city

15:04.940 --> 15:09.660
or else the feds will have to come in and handle it, apparently that's glorifying

15:09.660 --> 15:10.780
violence.

15:10.780 --> 15:13.900
There is obviously a political bias at play here.

15:13.900 --> 15:18.140
The best part about this whole thing is that Jack Dorsey himself seems to want to go to

15:18.140 --> 15:20.260
war against Trump over this.

15:20.260 --> 15:24.620
Twitter comms started a thread where they talked about the public interest notice they

15:24.620 --> 15:28.340
placed on Donald Trump's Twitter account and why they did it.

15:28.340 --> 15:32.140
And then Jack retweeted that from his personal account.

15:32.140 --> 15:36.820
Geez, it seems like he's openly picking a fight with Trump at this point.

15:36.820 --> 15:39.020
I hope he's secure in his position.

15:39.020 --> 15:43.500
But let's be honest here guys, the President isn't innocent himself.

15:43.500 --> 15:49.000
Here is one of many morons who wants things to go even further in the other direction,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.500
away from free speech.

15:50.500 --> 15:54.220
Dear Jack Dorsey, delete these ugly tweets, they're vicious lies.

15:54.220 --> 15:58.660
You must cleanse Twitter of this Trump stain, if not of Trump himself.

15:58.660 --> 16:03.180
Sincerely, Tribelaw, a Twitter user who couldn't get away even once with what Trump gets away

16:03.180 --> 16:04.220
with daily.

16:04.220 --> 16:05.620
They want him banned.

16:05.620 --> 16:10.660
They don't want the rules changed such that everyone can talk like Trump does.

16:10.660 --> 16:15.780
They want the rules enforced on Trump and he be removed from Twitter entirely.

16:15.780 --> 16:21.460
The article linked in this tweet covers an event that happened three or four days ago

16:21.460 --> 16:26.340
where Trump was tweeting legitimately false information, I'm pretty sure, about the

16:26.340 --> 16:29.220
death of Lori K. Closetus.

16:29.220 --> 16:30.700
And here's one of those tweets.

16:30.700 --> 16:36.420
Comcast should open up a long overdue Florida cold case against Psycho Joe Scarborough.

16:36.420 --> 16:41.420
I know him and Crazy Mika well, used them beautifully in the last election, dumped them

16:41.420 --> 16:44.660
nicely and will state on the record that he is nuts.

16:44.660 --> 16:46.540
Besides bad ratings.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.880
This is a very strange tweet guys.

16:48.880 --> 16:53.080
These tweets are in reference to the death of Lori K. Closetus, which was at the time

16:53.080 --> 16:57.920
nearly 20 years ago, suspected to be a murder, but later it came out that it was probably

16:57.920 --> 16:58.920
just an accident.

16:58.920 --> 17:02.240
However, Trump's here talking about it like it's a cold case.

17:02.240 --> 17:05.500
Here is a letter sent from her husband to Jack Dorsey.

17:05.500 --> 17:10.600
Nearly 19 years ago, my wife, who had an undiagnosed heart condition, fell and hit her head on

17:10.600 --> 17:12.520
her desk at work.

17:12.520 --> 17:15.080
She was found dead the next morning.

17:15.080 --> 17:19.000
Her name is Lori K. Closetus and she was 28 years old when she died.

17:19.000 --> 17:24.360
Her passing is the single most painful thing that I have ever had to deal with in my 52

17:24.360 --> 17:27.440
years and continues to haunt her parents and sister.

17:27.440 --> 17:31.880
There has been a constant barrage of falsehoods, half-truths, innuendo and conspiracy theories

17:31.880 --> 17:33.360
since the day she died.

17:33.360 --> 17:38.800
I realize this may sound like an exaggeration, unfortunately it is the verifiable truth.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.440
Because of this I have struggled to move forward with my life.

17:41.440 --> 17:46.160
The frequency, intensity, ugliness, and promulgation of these horrifying lies ever increases on

17:46.160 --> 17:47.160
the internet.

17:47.160 --> 17:51.720
These conspiracy theorists, including most recently the President of the United States,

17:51.720 --> 17:56.340
continue to spread their bile and misinformation on your platform, disparaging the memory of

17:56.340 --> 17:58.240
my wife and our marriage.

17:58.240 --> 18:02.360
President Trump on Tuesday tweeted to his nearly 80 million followers alluding to the

18:02.360 --> 18:08.000
repeatedly debunked falsehood that my wife was murdered by her boss, former US representative

18:08.000 --> 18:09.360
Joe Scarborough.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.520
And here's the three Trump tweets about it.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.240
My request is simple, please delete these tweets.

18:14.240 --> 18:17.880
I'm a research engineer and not a lawyer, but I have reviewed all of Twitter's rules

18:17.880 --> 18:19.220
in terms of service.

18:19.220 --> 18:23.240
The President's tweet that suggests Laurie was murdered, without any evidence and contrary

18:23.240 --> 18:28.600
to the official autopsy, is a violation of Twitter's community rules in terms of service.

18:28.600 --> 18:32.760
An ordinary user like me would be banished from the platform for such a tweet, but I

18:32.760 --> 18:35.120
am only asking that the tweets be removed.

18:35.120 --> 18:40.720
It seems like Trump has tweeted something that is not only false, but verifiably false,

18:40.720 --> 18:42.520
potentially even slanderous.

18:42.520 --> 18:47.400
And the author of this letter is right when he says that if it were anybody else, they

18:47.400 --> 18:48.480
would be banned.

18:48.480 --> 18:52.640
So what is the good solution here, because as far as I can see, every solution seems

18:52.640 --> 18:53.760
to be bad.

18:53.760 --> 18:58.240
We can continue with an unfair system, where Trump and some select others can say whatever

18:58.240 --> 19:01.880
they like, while plebs get routinely banned for far less.

19:01.880 --> 19:06.600
Maybe blue Twitter checkmarks with the right politics can go on saying anything that they

19:06.600 --> 19:09.160
like, without any repercussions at all.

19:09.160 --> 19:14.240
Maybe big name political figures like Trump can say things but have them put behind some

19:14.240 --> 19:19.140
kind of a wall, if Twitter's Ministry of Truth judges them to be fake news.

19:19.140 --> 19:21.000
And then maybe the rest of us just gets banned.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.400
That's how it is right now, and it's blatantly unfair.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.340
But what are the alternatives?

19:26.340 --> 19:30.280
Should Twitter start cracking down more and banning everyone regardless of their social

19:30.280 --> 19:31.280
status?

19:31.280 --> 19:34.660
Should Trump actually have his tweets deleted or be kicked off the platform?

19:34.660 --> 19:37.160
Because that begins to go against Supreme Court rulings.

19:37.160 --> 19:42.120
The last alternative is to let everyone say everything, free for all, old internet style.

19:42.120 --> 19:46.440
But this letter does prove that there actually is a little bit of a problem when it comes

19:46.440 --> 19:49.160
to, say, conspiracy theorists.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.440
Most of the time, conspiracy theories are just good fun.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.440
You turn on YouTube, well not YouTube anymore, because they've all been banned off of it.

19:54.440 --> 19:58.600
You turn on some kind of site somewhere, where people are talking about how the world's actually

19:58.600 --> 20:02.520
flat, and they're wearing tinfoil hats, and it's like goofy crazy nonsense.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.520
And really, only a minority of people are actually convinced by that stuff.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.200
Most of the time, regular people watch that stuff just to get a good laugh out of it.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.200
That's why the ancient aliens guy was a meme for so long.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.880
Because it's fun to watch an idiot with a dumb theory spiral into madness before your

20:15.880 --> 20:18.420
very eyes trying to explain all this nonsense.

20:18.420 --> 20:22.340
People are entertained by the absurd, but you also have conspiracy theories like the

20:22.340 --> 20:24.640
one that Trump peddled about this dead woman.

20:24.640 --> 20:28.100
And that will always be the fundamental problem with free speech, is that sometimes you have

20:28.100 --> 20:34.400
to countenance speech that is not only offensive to you, but is ridiculous, is very clearly

20:34.400 --> 20:35.400
false.

20:35.400 --> 20:39.640
But again, that's what being an adult is, figuring it out for yourself.

20:39.640 --> 20:44.140
And even though that's not an ideal solution, it seems to be the best one we have.

20:44.140 --> 20:49.140
What makes this all very interesting is that this is happening at the exact same time as

20:49.140 --> 20:53.020
another report's coming out, that almost nobody's talking about.

20:53.020 --> 20:56.260
Leonard French did a stream on it because he's a lawyer, he's like a lawyer YouTuber,

20:56.260 --> 20:59.140
and if you want to go watch his stream, I highly recommend you do.

20:59.140 --> 21:02.900
But this is section 512 of title 17.

21:02.900 --> 21:05.260
This is specifically part of copyright law.

21:05.260 --> 21:10.220
And this is basically a study commissioned by the US Copyright Office to investigate

21:10.220 --> 21:14.060
how exactly YouTube abuses the DMCA.

21:14.060 --> 21:17.960
And as you can see here, there's a part regarding section 512 safe harbors.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.240
This is obviously not the same safe harbors as section 230.

21:21.240 --> 21:27.040
This basically refers to why YouTube isn't held liable for copyright infringement when

21:27.040 --> 21:30.840
its users upload copyrighted content to the platform.

21:30.840 --> 21:33.840
It is a similar set of law, but it is different.

21:33.840 --> 21:38.600
And it seems like social media is going to be coming under fire from that angle as well.

21:38.600 --> 21:43.640
Because just like with section 230, they have also been abusing their safe harbor status

21:43.640 --> 21:44.640
over here.

21:44.640 --> 21:48.600
This is a very interesting read, but it is very long and very technical.

21:48.600 --> 21:53.260
And like I said, I would recommend you go and watch Leonard French's stream on this

21:53.260 --> 21:57.280
subject as he goes into this whole thing in depth.

21:57.280 --> 22:02.260
But the important part for me is that this is coming at the exact same time as Trump

22:02.260 --> 22:05.520
is beginning to bring the hammer down regarding section 230.

22:05.520 --> 22:11.860
Basically, big tech has been abusing all of the various safe harbors it's been given.

22:11.860 --> 22:16.580
It was given them so that they could grow freely and maintain their business models.

22:16.580 --> 22:19.980
But now that they've created the monopolies that they have, they are exploiting their

22:19.980 --> 22:24.620
status to directly punish people who use their platforms, all the while continuing to say

22:24.620 --> 22:29.340
that it's vital to a free and open internet that they continue to do this and get off

22:29.340 --> 22:30.800
scot-free with it.

22:30.800 --> 22:35.220
And while it might sound great that the government's finally coming down on big tech and we're

22:35.220 --> 22:39.740
finally going to see some kind of freedom from their tyranny, this is not necessarily

22:39.740 --> 22:41.200
the good ending, guys.

22:41.200 --> 22:46.180
Because while it's nightmarish and dystopian to have corporations deciding what is and

22:46.180 --> 22:50.920
isn't free speech, do you really want the government stepping in and taking control?

22:50.920 --> 22:53.100
Do you want a nationalized Twitter?

22:53.100 --> 22:55.100
Because that's what Weibo is over in China.

22:55.100 --> 22:59.180
On their isolated internet, they have their own social media platforms, directly controlled

22:59.180 --> 23:02.380
by the government, and they regulate what people can and can't say.

23:02.380 --> 23:07.320
While corporate tyranny is alive and real, so is government tyranny.

23:07.320 --> 23:12.500
And if we have to use the government to step in and bring us free speech again, we also

23:12.500 --> 23:15.740
have to make sure they don't overstep their bounds.

23:15.740 --> 23:21.700
Because we can very easily stumble into a place where we have, say, a nationalized Twitter,

23:21.700 --> 23:26.700
or a nationalized internet, a department of propaganda, where the only truth you can publish

23:26.700 --> 23:30.660
online is the truth that the current government allows you to publish.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.980
That would be just as bad as what we currently have.

23:32.980 --> 23:38.280
The ideal solution to all of this is that big tech stops shitting the bed, stops ruining

23:38.280 --> 23:42.100
it for everyone else, and actually pulls their heads out of their asses.

23:42.100 --> 23:46.940
But they seem to want to be the moral arbiters of what is right and wrong for every single

23:46.940 --> 23:48.900
person that currently exists.

23:48.900 --> 23:54.100
I don't want an internet where a handful of CEOs decides what the truth is.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.020
Decides what you're allowed to post.

23:56.020 --> 23:58.420
Decides what you're allowed to think and feel.

23:58.420 --> 24:00.500
Decides what's offensive or not.

24:00.500 --> 24:05.020
But I also don't want an internet where the American government decides that as well.

24:05.020 --> 24:06.980
That is for people to decide.

24:06.980 --> 24:11.580
If that means that sometimes misinformation gets through.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.640
Sometimes you see conspiracy theories on your feed.

24:14.640 --> 24:19.700
Sometimes somebody calls you a nasty name and you have to block them, fine.

24:19.700 --> 24:20.700
So be it.

24:20.700 --> 24:21.700
We're adults.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.620
We can make decisions for ourselves.

24:23.620 --> 24:27.860
I'm tired of having my hand held every single time I open up my browser.
