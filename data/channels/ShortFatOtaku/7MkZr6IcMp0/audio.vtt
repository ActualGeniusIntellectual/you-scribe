00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
5.

00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
MOUSE

00:02.000 --> 00:11.000
Recently, a Tennessee school district banned a Holocaust novel called Mouse over concerns

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
about its violence, nudity, and profanity.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.360
It's a comic book about the Holocaust, where the Jews are portrayed as mice and the Germans

00:17.360 --> 00:18.360
as cats.

00:18.360 --> 00:22.040
It's meant for a young adult audience, as the serious subject matter combined with the

00:22.040 --> 00:23.720
cutesy style would suggest.

00:23.720 --> 00:27.400
The school board's objections were that the comic showed characters being hung, children

00:27.400 --> 00:31.440
being slaughtered, you know, and children shouldn't be subjected to that type of imagery,

00:31.440 --> 00:33.280
even if it's still cats and mice.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.480
And fair enough, maybe not small children, but like I said, it's probably appropriate

00:36.480 --> 00:37.480
for the teen years.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.400
At the end of the day, to teach up with the Holocaust, you must show the reality of the

00:40.400 --> 00:42.560
Holocaust, and that reality is brutal.

00:42.560 --> 00:46.920
Of course, because the Streisand effect is a thing, Mouse's sales shot up as a result

00:46.920 --> 00:48.440
of that negative publicity.

00:48.440 --> 00:52.280
When I was a kid, I'm talking around 12 years old specifically in my case, when I learned

00:52.280 --> 00:56.520
that a book was on my school's banned list, and there were a few, I generally went to

00:56.520 --> 00:59.680
the library to read it, as I was an avid reader growing up.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.200
And nowadays with Amazon or other online shops, people can buy these books relatively easily,

01:04.200 --> 01:07.600
so I've always found that schools banning books is just a big waste of time.

01:07.600 --> 01:11.280
But the real story here is how the Mouse event was covered on The View.

01:11.280 --> 01:15.300
Now, I don't know a single person who actually watches The View, and I haven't seen an episode

01:15.300 --> 01:19.600
of it since I lived at my parents' place, because as far as I recall, my mom loved that

01:19.600 --> 01:20.600
shit.

01:20.600 --> 01:24.480
And you know what, I kind of forgot it existed, until Whoopi Goldberg got in trouble for this

01:24.480 --> 01:25.480
comment.

01:25.480 --> 01:30.160
Also, if you're going to do this, then let's be truthful about it, because the Holocaust

01:30.160 --> 01:31.560
isn't about race.

01:31.560 --> 01:32.560
What?

01:32.560 --> 01:33.560
No.

01:33.560 --> 01:40.640
It's not about race, but it's, it's not about race.

01:40.640 --> 01:46.960
It's not about race, because it's about man's inhumanity to man.

01:46.960 --> 01:47.960
Okay.

01:47.960 --> 01:50.320
Okay, she's technically correct.

01:50.320 --> 01:55.320
The Holocaust was about man's inhumanity to man, but it's also about race.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.320
Do you see this book here?

01:56.320 --> 01:57.320
I fucking read it.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.320
There's a lot in here about race.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.320
I don't know what you're fucking talking about, dude.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.320
That's what it's about.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.320
But it's about white supremacy.

02:01.320 --> 02:08.000
Well, it's not about race, but these are two white groups of people.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
And there's the rub.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.260
This is a very American viewpoint on race that Whoopi Goldberg is presenting here.

02:13.260 --> 02:18.160
She considers Jews to be white, and so to her, the Holocaust is simply white on white

02:18.160 --> 02:19.160
crime.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.700
But that's not how the people involved in the Holocaust sought Hitler.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.720
You know, in that book, he doesn't actually talk about the white race.

02:25.120 --> 02:29.180
He talks about the Germanic race, the Aryan race, the Nordic race, and their relationships

02:29.180 --> 02:32.680
with the Slavic race, or the Mediterranean race, or the Jewish race.

02:32.680 --> 02:36.880
All groups of people that we overhear in North America generally lumped together as white,

02:36.880 --> 02:40.840
but to Nazi racial ideology, they were not considered part of the same stock.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.400
Well, they didn't have to feed them as white businesses.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.000
But you're missing the point.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
You're missing the point.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.040
The minute you turn it into race, it goes down this alley.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.880
Let's talk about it for what it is.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.960
It's how people treat each other.

02:53.960 --> 02:54.960
It's a problem.

02:54.960 --> 03:01.600
It doesn't matter if you're black or white, because black, white, Jews, everybody eats

03:01.600 --> 03:02.600
each other.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.280
To Whoopi's credit, she's actually correct here.

03:04.280 --> 03:07.000
Every group of people on earth is both an oppressor and the oppressed.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.180
That's just how it is.

03:08.180 --> 03:14.340
So is it, if you're uncomfortable, if you hear about Maus, should you be worried?

03:14.340 --> 03:17.440
Should your child say, oh my God, I wonder if that's me?

03:17.440 --> 03:19.120
No, that's not what they're going to say.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.520
They're going to say, I don't want to be like that.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.480
The music coming in to try and play it off.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.040
Not happening this time, Sam.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.040
Well, hopefully.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.400
I don't want to be cool.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.240
Most kids, most kids, they don't want to be cool.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.240
No, they don't.

03:33.240 --> 03:39.180
We're living in an era where people are comparing vaccine cards to the yellow stars, where people

03:39.180 --> 03:42.920
are comparing vaccinations to what Anne Frank went through.

03:42.920 --> 03:46.080
So it is necessary for kids to learn about.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.120
Yeah, it's not at that level.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.800
Let's hope it ever gets there, lady.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.460
Thankfully, it's turning around in most places.

03:51.460 --> 03:55.060
But there's still that one school making kids wear yellow stars if they've got a medical

03:55.060 --> 03:56.300
exemption for masks.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.300
Jesus.

03:57.300 --> 04:03.500
To learn about man's inhumanity to man, however it exposes itself, I have to cut you off.

04:03.500 --> 04:08.740
I just want to say that Maus was banned and it flew to top 20 of Amazon's rules last thing.

04:08.740 --> 04:09.740
Of charts.

04:09.740 --> 04:10.740
Yes.

04:10.740 --> 04:12.380
The more you ban it, the more we want to read it.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.380
And there you have it.

04:13.380 --> 04:14.380
What a shit show, eh?

04:14.380 --> 04:18.860
The problem here isn't that Whoopi Goldberg is hateful or anything, though, I mean, maybe.

04:18.860 --> 04:22.880
It's that she's operating with a very specific, very narrow lens on race that leads to her

04:22.880 --> 04:27.500
saying such dumb shit as, the Holocaust wasn't about race, because the American experience

04:27.500 --> 04:29.540
on race is extremely black and white.

04:29.540 --> 04:30.540
Literally, in fact.

04:30.540 --> 04:33.180
From the Nazi perspective, it was Semites versus Aryans.

04:33.180 --> 04:36.320
They felt no kinship with them based on skin color.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.940
Of course, Whoopi Goldberg went on to apologize on Twitter.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.260
Is that a new avatar?

04:40.260 --> 04:42.760
I will say it fits the situation.

04:42.760 --> 04:47.060
On today's show, I said the Holocaust is not about race, but about man's inhumanity to

04:47.060 --> 04:48.060
man.

04:48.260 --> 04:49.260
It's about both.

04:49.260 --> 04:52.340
As Jonathan Greenblatt from the Anti-Defamation League shared, the Holocaust was about the

04:52.340 --> 04:56.180
Nazi systematic annihilation of the Jewish people, who they deemed to be in an inferior

04:56.180 --> 04:57.180
race.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.180
I stand corrected.

04:58.180 --> 05:00.700
The Jewish people around the world have always had my support, and that will never waver.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.420
I am sorry for the hurt I've caused.

05:02.420 --> 05:06.180
What quickly followed was a series of funny and weird events, starting with the president

05:06.180 --> 05:10.400
of ABC suspending Whoopi Goldberg from The View for two weeks, stating, while Whoopi

05:10.400 --> 05:14.220
has apologized, I have asked her to take time to reflect and learn about the impact

05:14.220 --> 05:15.220
of her comments.

05:15.380 --> 05:20.380
The entire ABC news organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends,

05:20.380 --> 05:21.700
family, and communities.

05:21.700 --> 05:26.020
Whoopi responded by wearing a jacket that had innocent printed on it, even though she

05:26.020 --> 05:27.300
had already apologized.

05:27.300 --> 05:28.300
Alright.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.740
People also began to take note of the obvious hypocrisy.

05:30.740 --> 05:35.940
In March of 2021, Sharon Osborn was invited to leave her position on CBS's The Talk

05:35.940 --> 05:40.440
over accusations of racism, for defending Piers Morgan's criticisms of Meghan Markle.

05:40.440 --> 05:46.040
In 2018, Roseanne Barr had her show canceled off of ABC after sending this, uh, pretty

05:46.040 --> 05:49.680
spicy tweet about Valerie Jarrett, one of Obama's advisors.

05:49.680 --> 05:53.320
If the Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes had a baby, Jesus.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.480
I'm sure her supporting Trump didn't help either.

05:55.480 --> 06:00.280
And of course, Gia Serrano was let go from her star role on Lucasfilm's The Mandalorian

06:00.280 --> 06:04.760
for stating that being a Republican today is like being Jewish during the Holocaust.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.360
Me personally, I don't want to see any of these people fired.

06:07.360 --> 06:12.600
I like free speech, but considering that CBS, ABC, and Lucasfilm are all owned by Disney,

06:12.600 --> 06:14.800
it's not like there's a difference where the buck stops.

06:14.800 --> 06:20.440
Osborn, Barr, and Serrano all said some pretty bad stuff, but none of it is as bad as Holocaust

06:20.440 --> 06:21.560
revisionism.

06:21.560 --> 06:25.960
And yet, unlike those three, Whoopi Goldberg only got a slap on the wrist.

06:25.960 --> 06:29.480
Maybe it's because she's black, and her blackness affords her an extra level of protection in

06:29.480 --> 06:31.420
a CRT intersectional world.

06:31.420 --> 06:35.200
Maybe it's because she's characterized the Holocaust as being whites against whites.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.400
And so from a black perspective, what does she care?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.580
That's also valid from the CRT point of view.

06:39.580 --> 06:42.560
In fact, she said exactly that when talking to Stephen Colbert.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.120
Like, asking the Nazis, they would say, yes, it's a racial issue.

06:45.120 --> 06:50.040
Well, see, this is what's interesting to me, because the Nazis lied.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.200
It wasn't.

06:51.200 --> 06:59.840
They they had issues with ethnicity, not with race, because most of the Nazis were white

06:59.840 --> 07:03.600
people and most of the people they were attacking were white people.

07:03.600 --> 07:08.880
So to me, I'm thinking, how can you how can you say it's about race if you are fighting

07:08.880 --> 07:10.000
each other?

07:10.000 --> 07:15.680
So it all really began because I said, how will children how will we explain to children

07:15.680 --> 07:18.340
what happened in Nazi Germany?

07:18.340 --> 07:23.120
This wasn't I said, this wasn't racial.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.520
This was about white on white.

07:25.520 --> 07:30.240
Back in November of 2021, Goldberg had another spicy conversation on The View, though this

07:30.240 --> 07:31.480
one flew under the radar.

07:31.480 --> 07:34.640
This time, it's a discussion about the Virginia election and how critical race theory was

07:34.640 --> 08:00.480
impacting the race.

08:01.480 --> 08:04.840
It is college level stuff, at least it was when I went to university.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.960
When I was younger, intro to critical theory was a first year course, but it's certainly

08:07.960 --> 08:10.480
not only law school, it's an offer for anybody.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.880
The discipline may have started as critical legal theory, but it's expanded far beyond

08:13.880 --> 08:14.880
that.

08:14.880 --> 08:15.880
And hey, who knows?

08:15.880 --> 08:17.200
Maybe it's wormed its way into high schools by now.

08:17.200 --> 08:25.760
I know that at least gender studies has.

08:25.760 --> 08:31.200
Yes, but you know, you live in the United States, you know, that color of skin has been

08:31.200 --> 08:36.280
mattering to people can't we change it that it was weak, we need white people to step

08:36.280 --> 08:37.280
up and do that.

08:37.280 --> 08:40.160
But I think that we they've been doing that since the Civil War.

08:40.160 --> 08:43.000
And I'm not saying no, no, no.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.720
My God, whoopee.

08:45.720 --> 08:49.000
Do you think the Civil War was blacks versus whites?

08:49.000 --> 08:54.720
Do you think no white blood was shed to end slavery in America, this idea that everything

08:54.720 --> 08:58.920
is whitey's fault, and everything bad is white and everything good is black has got

08:58.920 --> 08:59.920
to fucking stop?

08:59.920 --> 09:04.920
It's legitimately racist.

09:04.920 --> 09:21.680
Yeah, was, where is it okay now whoopee?

09:21.680 --> 09:23.080
This is fucking crazy, dude.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.000
You're so married to your own trauma.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.480
And let's not pretend here that you've experienced any of it since you got rich, that you would

09:28.480 --> 09:32.440
rather see the trauma perpetuated instead of actually solving problems, because solving

09:32.440 --> 09:37.400
problems means you can no longer perpetually blame white people for whatever ails you.

09:37.400 --> 09:42.620
Race is defined as a category of humankind that shares certain distinctive physical traits.

09:42.620 --> 09:46.640
Ethnicity is defined as the fact or state of belonging to a social group as a common

09:46.640 --> 09:48.520
national or cultural tradition.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.320
There is an overlap there, sure, but they're not the same thing.

09:51.320 --> 09:56.040
Regarding the American experience, white and black skin are so visually distinct, it's

09:56.040 --> 09:59.160
easy to conceptualize racial groups at a quick glance.

09:59.160 --> 10:03.100
But when Whoopee Goldberg says that the Holocaust is white on white, and it's about ethnicity,

10:03.100 --> 10:04.460
not race, she's wrong.

10:04.460 --> 10:08.320
It looks that way to her because she's an American intersectionalist, but it's not the

10:08.320 --> 10:09.720
fact of the matter.

10:09.720 --> 10:15.840
Nazi race science explicitly relied on distinctive physical traits with distinct religious, cultural,

10:15.840 --> 10:19.600
linguistic and territorial similarities of ethnicity taking a back burner.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.820
That's why they focus so much on semantic racial traits, like darker skin and hair,

10:23.820 --> 10:25.560
or curly hair, or larger noses.

10:25.560 --> 10:28.640
Whenever you see pictures of those German doctors measuring the width of somebody's

10:28.640 --> 10:32.140
nose or the size of their skulls, they're not appealing to ethnicity, they're appealing

10:32.140 --> 10:33.140
to race.

10:33.140 --> 10:36.460
So yes, Whoopee Goldberg is just wrong, but the reason she sticks with such a bizarre

10:36.460 --> 10:38.420
view is because of critical theory.

10:38.420 --> 10:42.640
I will have to eventually cover that shitshow in depth at some point on this channel.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.680
But here's the sky high CRT view.

10:44.680 --> 10:48.920
The overarching intersectional view of the world is that the white 1% control institutions

10:48.920 --> 10:52.600
and governments in order to uphold a global system of capitalist patriarchal white supremacy,

10:52.600 --> 10:56.240
and that even if individual white people don't agree with it or have anything to do with

10:56.240 --> 10:59.880
it, they still benefit from it and victimize non-whites as oppressors.

10:59.880 --> 11:04.560
Meanwhile, Nazi ideology believed that a small minority of rich Jews, without a nation-state

11:04.560 --> 11:08.680
of their own, controlled institutions and governments across Europe to uphold a capitalist

11:08.680 --> 11:14.540
system of Jewish supremacy, where even individual innocent Jews benefited and victimized non-Jews.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.280
Does this sound familiar?

11:16.320 --> 11:20.440
Oh, also, as Whoopee said earlier, the intersectional view is that Jews are in fact white.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.420
No wonder she's so flippant about the Holocaust.

11:22.420 --> 11:26.840
A lot has been said recently about the prevalence of black-on-Jew crime in America, and about

11:26.840 --> 11:30.640
the rise of people like Louis Farrakhan, the anti-Semitic black supremacist.

11:30.640 --> 11:34.460
A lot has been said about the anti-Semitism on the broader left, with the UK's Labour

11:34.460 --> 11:38.840
Party being full of it, with the socialists routinely noticing that their globalist 1%

11:38.840 --> 11:44.640
bourgeoisie has a lot of heavy overlap with the Nazis internationalist Jewish banker class.

11:44.680 --> 11:49.280
Moreover, it's not hard at all to find prominent Jewish leftists who call themselves white

11:49.280 --> 11:53.780
when it's time to publicly denigrate themselves as oppressors, and who call themselves Jewish

11:53.780 --> 11:56.560
when it's time to present themselves as victims of a hate crime.

11:56.560 --> 12:00.240
Of course, all of these people conveniently ignore that black Jews exist.

12:00.240 --> 12:03.920
Some of the more extremist elements in Israel even go so far as to say that they're not

12:03.920 --> 12:04.920
real Jews.

12:04.920 --> 12:08.920
Hell, back in 2011 Whoopee Goldberg herself claimed she was Jewish, that's a twist.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.600
Way to throw your own Jewish in-group under the bus for your black in-group, lady.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.160
Wait a minute, actually she didn't even stand up for her black in-group either, because

12:16.160 --> 12:18.760
damn she's laughing on a white guy who does blackface.

12:18.760 --> 12:21.000
And she's standing up for pedophiles too?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
What the fuck?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.360
I guess the TLDR on Whoopee Goldberg is that she's just a fucking moron.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.640
But the ideology guiding her, that's what's worth talking about.

12:27.640 --> 12:31.640
It brought her to this ridiculous point of saying that everybody is racist except the

12:31.640 --> 12:32.640
Nazis.

12:32.640 --> 12:33.800
That was just white on white.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.360
Would she feel the same way about the Rwandan genocide, since it was one black group killing

12:37.360 --> 12:38.360
another black group?

12:38.360 --> 12:41.540
Or how about the Japanese and Nanking, that's just Asian on Asian.

12:41.540 --> 12:45.420
The ultimate issue with critical race theory framing is that it requires white people to

12:45.420 --> 12:48.820
always be the evil oppressor due to institutionalized power.

12:48.820 --> 12:51.620
And so blacks can't be racist, they're just punching up.

12:51.620 --> 12:54.440
Anybody with their head on straight knows exactly how dumb this sounds.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.200
Even they know how dumb it sounds.

12:56.200 --> 13:00.620
The ADL is a garbage organization, but for a long time their definition of racism was

13:00.620 --> 13:04.240
the belief that a particular race is superior or inferior to another.

13:04.240 --> 13:08.780
As the ADL moved away from the liberal ideal and regressed into the tribalism of intersectionality,

13:08.780 --> 13:14.060
they changed that definition to the marginalization and or oppression of people of color based

13:14.060 --> 13:17.480
on a socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.400
And under this view, Whoopi is actually correct.

13:19.400 --> 13:23.780
The Nazis weren't racist because their actions oppressed whites, not people of color and

13:23.780 --> 13:26.180
privileged Germans, not all whites.

13:26.180 --> 13:30.940
The critical theory view, the intersectional view has to be pro Nazi.

13:30.940 --> 13:35.780
After the Whoopi Goldberg shit show hit the fan, the ADL changed the page to an interim

13:35.780 --> 13:39.380
definition, basically admitting that this was temporary just to get people to shut up.

13:39.380 --> 13:43.900
Racism occurs when individuals or institutions show more favorable evaluation or treatment

13:43.900 --> 13:47.180
of an individual or group based on race or ethnicity.

13:47.180 --> 13:50.300
Expect this definition to vanish after the storm has passed.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.600
CRT is legitimately racist.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.700
Intersectionality is absolutely bigoted.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.820
That doesn't mean that you need these things to be racist or bigoted.

13:56.820 --> 14:01.260
The old style white supremacy can still exist, but you have to be a moron to think that nowadays

14:01.260 --> 14:02.880
it's actually ascendant.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.700
Most people today are just centrist liberal types.

14:05.700 --> 14:09.040
They genuinely want people to be judged on the content of their character and not the

14:09.040 --> 14:10.040
color of their skin.

14:10.040 --> 14:14.820
But that completely reasonable desire, that trend towards individualism, is why progressives

14:14.820 --> 14:18.460
screech racism every time and it's why Whoopi Goldberg can get away with minimizing the

14:18.460 --> 14:20.500
Holocaust along racial lines.

14:20.500 --> 14:24.540
When they cry racist, they're calling you what they are and they're expecting you

14:24.540 --> 14:29.900
to be shamed for your reasonable opinions when their direct actions are infinitely worse.
