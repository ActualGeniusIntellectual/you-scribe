1000	2000	MOUSE
2000	11000	Recently, a Tennessee school district banned a Holocaust novel called Mouse over concerns
11000	13000	about its violence, nudity, and profanity.
13000	17360	It's a comic book about the Holocaust, where the Jews are portrayed as mice and the Germans
17360	18360	as cats.
18360	22040	It's meant for a young adult audience, as the serious subject matter combined with the
22040	23720	cutesy style would suggest.
23720	27400	The school board's objections were that the comic showed characters being hung, children
27400	31440	being slaughtered, you know, and children shouldn't be subjected to that type of imagery,
31440	33280	even if it's still cats and mice.
33280	36480	And fair enough, maybe not small children, but like I said, it's probably appropriate
36480	37480	for the teen years.
37480	40400	At the end of the day, to teach up with the Holocaust, you must show the reality of the
40400	42560	Holocaust, and that reality is brutal.
42560	46920	Of course, because the Streisand effect is a thing, Mouse's sales shot up as a result
46920	48440	of that negative publicity.
48440	52280	When I was a kid, I'm talking around 12 years old specifically in my case, when I learned
52280	56520	that a book was on my school's banned list, and there were a few, I generally went to
56520	59680	the library to read it, as I was an avid reader growing up.
59680	64200	And nowadays with Amazon or other online shops, people can buy these books relatively easily,
64200	67600	so I've always found that schools banning books is just a big waste of time.
67600	71280	But the real story here is how the Mouse event was covered on The View.
71280	75300	Now, I don't know a single person who actually watches The View, and I haven't seen an episode
75300	79600	of it since I lived at my parents' place, because as far as I recall, my mom loved that
79600	80600	shit.
80600	84480	And you know what, I kind of forgot it existed, until Whoopi Goldberg got in trouble for this
84480	85480	comment.
85480	90160	Also, if you're going to do this, then let's be truthful about it, because the Holocaust
90160	91560	isn't about race.
91560	92560	What?
92560	93560	No.
93560	100640	It's not about race, but it's, it's not about race.
100640	106960	It's not about race, because it's about man's inhumanity to man.
106960	107960	Okay.
107960	110320	Okay, she's technically correct.
110320	115320	The Holocaust was about man's inhumanity to man, but it's also about race.
115320	116320	Do you see this book here?
116320	117320	I fucking read it.
117320	118320	There's a lot in here about race.
118320	119320	I don't know what you're fucking talking about, dude.
119320	120320	That's what it's about.
120320	121320	But it's about white supremacy.
121320	128000	Well, it's not about race, but these are two white groups of people.
128000	129000	And there's the rub.
129000	133260	This is a very American viewpoint on race that Whoopi Goldberg is presenting here.
133260	138160	She considers Jews to be white, and so to her, the Holocaust is simply white on white
138160	139160	crime.
139160	141700	But that's not how the people involved in the Holocaust sought Hitler.
141700	144720	You know, in that book, he doesn't actually talk about the white race.
145120	149180	He talks about the Germanic race, the Aryan race, the Nordic race, and their relationships
149180	152680	with the Slavic race, or the Mediterranean race, or the Jewish race.
152680	156880	All groups of people that we overhear in North America generally lumped together as white,
156880	160840	but to Nazi racial ideology, they were not considered part of the same stock.
160840	163400	Well, they didn't have to feed them as white businesses.
163400	165000	But you're missing the point.
165000	166000	You're missing the point.
166000	170040	The minute you turn it into race, it goes down this alley.
170040	171880	Let's talk about it for what it is.
171880	173960	It's how people treat each other.
173960	174960	It's a problem.
174960	181600	It doesn't matter if you're black or white, because black, white, Jews, everybody eats
181600	182600	each other.
182600	184280	To Whoopi's credit, she's actually correct here.
184280	187000	Every group of people on earth is both an oppressor and the oppressed.
187000	188180	That's just how it is.
188180	194340	So is it, if you're uncomfortable, if you hear about Maus, should you be worried?
194340	197440	Should your child say, oh my God, I wonder if that's me?
197440	199120	No, that's not what they're going to say.
199120	202520	They're going to say, I don't want to be like that.
202520	204480	The music coming in to try and play it off.
204480	206040	Not happening this time, Sam.
206040	207040	Well, hopefully.
207040	209400	I don't want to be cool.
209400	212240	Most kids, most kids, they don't want to be cool.
212240	213240	No, they don't.
213240	219180	We're living in an era where people are comparing vaccine cards to the yellow stars, where people
219180	222920	are comparing vaccinations to what Anne Frank went through.
222920	226080	So it is necessary for kids to learn about.
226080	228120	Yeah, it's not at that level.
228120	229800	Let's hope it ever gets there, lady.
229800	231460	Thankfully, it's turning around in most places.
231460	235060	But there's still that one school making kids wear yellow stars if they've got a medical
235060	236300	exemption for masks.
236300	237300	Jesus.
237300	243500	To learn about man's inhumanity to man, however it exposes itself, I have to cut you off.
243500	248740	I just want to say that Maus was banned and it flew to top 20 of Amazon's rules last thing.
248740	249740	Of charts.
249740	250740	Yes.
250740	252380	The more you ban it, the more we want to read it.
252380	253380	And there you have it.
253380	254380	What a shit show, eh?
254380	258860	The problem here isn't that Whoopi Goldberg is hateful or anything, though, I mean, maybe.
258860	262880	It's that she's operating with a very specific, very narrow lens on race that leads to her
262880	267500	saying such dumb shit as, the Holocaust wasn't about race, because the American experience
267500	269540	on race is extremely black and white.
269540	270540	Literally, in fact.
270540	273180	From the Nazi perspective, it was Semites versus Aryans.
273180	276320	They felt no kinship with them based on skin color.
276320	278940	Of course, Whoopi Goldberg went on to apologize on Twitter.
278940	280260	Is that a new avatar?
280260	282760	I will say it fits the situation.
282760	287060	On today's show, I said the Holocaust is not about race, but about man's inhumanity to
287060	288060	man.
288260	289260	It's about both.
289260	292340	As Jonathan Greenblatt from the Anti-Defamation League shared, the Holocaust was about the
292340	296180	Nazi systematic annihilation of the Jewish people, who they deemed to be in an inferior
296180	297180	race.
297180	298180	I stand corrected.
298180	300700	The Jewish people around the world have always had my support, and that will never waver.
300700	302420	I am sorry for the hurt I've caused.
302420	306180	What quickly followed was a series of funny and weird events, starting with the president
306180	310400	of ABC suspending Whoopi Goldberg from The View for two weeks, stating, while Whoopi
310400	314220	has apologized, I have asked her to take time to reflect and learn about the impact
314220	315220	of her comments.
315380	320380	The entire ABC news organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends,
320380	321700	family, and communities.
321700	326020	Whoopi responded by wearing a jacket that had innocent printed on it, even though she
326020	327300	had already apologized.
327300	328300	Alright.
328300	330740	People also began to take note of the obvious hypocrisy.
330740	335940	In March of 2021, Sharon Osborn was invited to leave her position on CBS's The Talk
335940	340440	over accusations of racism, for defending Piers Morgan's criticisms of Meghan Markle.
340440	346040	In 2018, Roseanne Barr had her show canceled off of ABC after sending this, uh, pretty
346040	349680	spicy tweet about Valerie Jarrett, one of Obama's advisors.
349680	353320	If the Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes had a baby, Jesus.
353320	355480	I'm sure her supporting Trump didn't help either.
355480	360280	And of course, Gia Serrano was let go from her star role on Lucasfilm's The Mandalorian
360280	364760	for stating that being a Republican today is like being Jewish during the Holocaust.
364760	367360	Me personally, I don't want to see any of these people fired.
367360	372600	I like free speech, but considering that CBS, ABC, and Lucasfilm are all owned by Disney,
372600	374800	it's not like there's a difference where the buck stops.
374800	380440	Osborn, Barr, and Serrano all said some pretty bad stuff, but none of it is as bad as Holocaust
380440	381560	revisionism.
381560	385960	And yet, unlike those three, Whoopi Goldberg only got a slap on the wrist.
385960	389480	Maybe it's because she's black, and her blackness affords her an extra level of protection in
389480	391420	a CRT intersectional world.
391420	395200	Maybe it's because she's characterized the Holocaust as being whites against whites.
395200	397400	And so from a black perspective, what does she care?
397400	399580	That's also valid from the CRT point of view.
399580	402560	In fact, she said exactly that when talking to Stephen Colbert.
402560	405120	Like, asking the Nazis, they would say, yes, it's a racial issue.
405120	410040	Well, see, this is what's interesting to me, because the Nazis lied.
410040	411200	It wasn't.
411200	419840	They they had issues with ethnicity, not with race, because most of the Nazis were white
419840	423600	people and most of the people they were attacking were white people.
423600	428880	So to me, I'm thinking, how can you how can you say it's about race if you are fighting
428880	430000	each other?
430000	435680	So it all really began because I said, how will children how will we explain to children
435680	438340	what happened in Nazi Germany?
438340	443120	This wasn't I said, this wasn't racial.
443120	445520	This was about white on white.
445520	450240	Back in November of 2021, Goldberg had another spicy conversation on The View, though this
450240	451480	one flew under the radar.
451480	454640	This time, it's a discussion about the Virginia election and how critical race theory was
454640	480480	impacting the race.
481480	484840	It is college level stuff, at least it was when I went to university.
484840	487960	When I was younger, intro to critical theory was a first year course, but it's certainly
487960	490480	not only law school, it's an offer for anybody.
490480	493880	The discipline may have started as critical legal theory, but it's expanded far beyond
493880	494880	that.
494880	495880	And hey, who knows?
495880	497200	Maybe it's wormed its way into high schools by now.
497200	505760	I know that at least gender studies has.
505760	511200	Yes, but you know, you live in the United States, you know, that color of skin has been
511200	516280	mattering to people can't we change it that it was weak, we need white people to step
516280	517280	up and do that.
517280	520160	But I think that we they've been doing that since the Civil War.
520160	523000	And I'm not saying no, no, no.
523000	525720	My God, whoopee.
525720	529000	Do you think the Civil War was blacks versus whites?
529000	534720	Do you think no white blood was shed to end slavery in America, this idea that everything
534720	538920	is whitey's fault, and everything bad is white and everything good is black has got
538920	539920	to fucking stop?
539920	544920	It's legitimately racist.
544920	561680	Yeah, was, where is it okay now whoopee?
561680	563080	This is fucking crazy, dude.
563080	565000	You're so married to your own trauma.
565000	568480	And let's not pretend here that you've experienced any of it since you got rich, that you would
568480	572440	rather see the trauma perpetuated instead of actually solving problems, because solving
572440	577400	problems means you can no longer perpetually blame white people for whatever ails you.
577400	582620	Race is defined as a category of humankind that shares certain distinctive physical traits.
582620	586640	Ethnicity is defined as the fact or state of belonging to a social group as a common
586640	588520	national or cultural tradition.
588520	591320	There is an overlap there, sure, but they're not the same thing.
591320	596040	Regarding the American experience, white and black skin are so visually distinct, it's
596040	599160	easy to conceptualize racial groups at a quick glance.
599160	603100	But when Whoopee Goldberg says that the Holocaust is white on white, and it's about ethnicity,
603100	604460	not race, she's wrong.
604460	608320	It looks that way to her because she's an American intersectionalist, but it's not the
608320	609720	fact of the matter.
609720	615840	Nazi race science explicitly relied on distinctive physical traits with distinct religious, cultural,
615840	619600	linguistic and territorial similarities of ethnicity taking a back burner.
619600	623820	That's why they focus so much on semantic racial traits, like darker skin and hair,
623820	625560	or curly hair, or larger noses.
625560	628640	Whenever you see pictures of those German doctors measuring the width of somebody's
628640	632140	nose or the size of their skulls, they're not appealing to ethnicity, they're appealing
632140	633140	to race.
633140	636460	So yes, Whoopee Goldberg is just wrong, but the reason she sticks with such a bizarre
636460	638420	view is because of critical theory.
638420	642640	I will have to eventually cover that shitshow in depth at some point on this channel.
642640	644680	But here's the sky high CRT view.
644680	648920	The overarching intersectional view of the world is that the white 1% control institutions
648920	652600	and governments in order to uphold a global system of capitalist patriarchal white supremacy,
652600	656240	and that even if individual white people don't agree with it or have anything to do with
656240	659880	it, they still benefit from it and victimize non-whites as oppressors.
659880	664560	Meanwhile, Nazi ideology believed that a small minority of rich Jews, without a nation-state
664560	668680	of their own, controlled institutions and governments across Europe to uphold a capitalist
668680	674540	system of Jewish supremacy, where even individual innocent Jews benefited and victimized non-Jews.
674540	676280	Does this sound familiar?
676320	680440	Oh, also, as Whoopee said earlier, the intersectional view is that Jews are in fact white.
680440	682420	No wonder she's so flippant about the Holocaust.
682420	686840	A lot has been said recently about the prevalence of black-on-Jew crime in America, and about
686840	690640	the rise of people like Louis Farrakhan, the anti-Semitic black supremacist.
690640	694460	A lot has been said about the anti-Semitism on the broader left, with the UK's Labour
694460	698840	Party being full of it, with the socialists routinely noticing that their globalist 1%
698840	704640	bourgeoisie has a lot of heavy overlap with the Nazis internationalist Jewish banker class.
704680	709280	Moreover, it's not hard at all to find prominent Jewish leftists who call themselves white
709280	713780	when it's time to publicly denigrate themselves as oppressors, and who call themselves Jewish
713780	716560	when it's time to present themselves as victims of a hate crime.
716560	720240	Of course, all of these people conveniently ignore that black Jews exist.
720240	723920	Some of the more extremist elements in Israel even go so far as to say that they're not
723920	724920	real Jews.
724920	728920	Hell, back in 2011 Whoopee Goldberg herself claimed she was Jewish, that's a twist.
728920	732600	Way to throw your own Jewish in-group under the bus for your black in-group, lady.
732600	736160	Wait a minute, actually she didn't even stand up for her black in-group either, because
736160	738760	damn she's laughing on a white guy who does blackface.
738760	741000	And she's standing up for pedophiles too?
741000	742000	What the fuck?
742000	744360	I guess the TLDR on Whoopee Goldberg is that she's just a fucking moron.
744360	747640	But the ideology guiding her, that's what's worth talking about.
747640	751640	It brought her to this ridiculous point of saying that everybody is racist except the
751640	752640	Nazis.
752640	753800	That was just white on white.
753800	757360	Would she feel the same way about the Rwandan genocide, since it was one black group killing
757360	758360	another black group?
758360	761540	Or how about the Japanese and Nanking, that's just Asian on Asian.
761540	765420	The ultimate issue with critical race theory framing is that it requires white people to
765420	768820	always be the evil oppressor due to institutionalized power.
768820	771620	And so blacks can't be racist, they're just punching up.
771620	774440	Anybody with their head on straight knows exactly how dumb this sounds.
774440	776200	Even they know how dumb it sounds.
776200	780620	The ADL is a garbage organization, but for a long time their definition of racism was
780620	784240	the belief that a particular race is superior or inferior to another.
784240	788780	As the ADL moved away from the liberal ideal and regressed into the tribalism of intersectionality,
788780	794060	they changed that definition to the marginalization and or oppression of people of color based
794060	797480	on a socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people.
797480	799400	And under this view, Whoopi is actually correct.
799400	803780	The Nazis weren't racist because their actions oppressed whites, not people of color and
803780	806180	privileged Germans, not all whites.
806180	810940	The critical theory view, the intersectional view has to be pro Nazi.
810940	815780	After the Whoopi Goldberg shit show hit the fan, the ADL changed the page to an interim
815780	819380	definition, basically admitting that this was temporary just to get people to shut up.
819380	823900	Racism occurs when individuals or institutions show more favorable evaluation or treatment
823900	827180	of an individual or group based on race or ethnicity.
827180	830300	Expect this definition to vanish after the storm has passed.
830300	832600	CRT is legitimately racist.
832600	833700	Intersectionality is absolutely bigoted.
833700	836820	That doesn't mean that you need these things to be racist or bigoted.
836820	841260	The old style white supremacy can still exist, but you have to be a moron to think that nowadays
841260	842880	it's actually ascendant.
842880	845700	Most people today are just centrist liberal types.
845700	849040	They genuinely want people to be judged on the content of their character and not the
849040	850040	color of their skin.
850040	854820	But that completely reasonable desire, that trend towards individualism, is why progressives
854820	858460	screech racism every time and it's why Whoopi Goldberg can get away with minimizing the
858460	860500	Holocaust along racial lines.
860500	864540	When they cry racist, they're calling you what they are and they're expecting you
864540	869900	to be shamed for your reasonable opinions when their direct actions are infinitely worse.
