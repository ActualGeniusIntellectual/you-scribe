1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
5.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
MOUSE

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Recently, a Tennessee school district banned a Holocaust novel called Mouse over concerns

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
about its violence, nudity, and profanity.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,360
It's a comic book about the Holocaust, where the Jews are portrayed as mice and the Germans

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,360
as cats.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,040
It's meant for a young adult audience, as the serious subject matter combined with the

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,720
cutesy style would suggest.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,400
The school board's objections were that the comic showed characters being hung, children

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,440
being slaughtered, you know, and children shouldn't be subjected to that type of imagery,

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,280
even if it's still cats and mice.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,480
And fair enough, maybe not small children, but like I said, it's probably appropriate

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
for the teen years.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,400
At the end of the day, to teach up with the Holocaust, you must show the reality of the

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,560
Holocaust, and that reality is brutal.

16
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,920
Of course, because the Streisand effect is a thing, Mouse's sales shot up as a result

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,440
of that negative publicity.

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,280
When I was a kid, I'm talking around 12 years old specifically in my case, when I learned

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,520
that a book was on my school's banned list, and there were a few, I generally went to

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,680
the library to read it, as I was an avid reader growing up.

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,200
And nowadays with Amazon or other online shops, people can buy these books relatively easily,

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,600
so I've always found that schools banning books is just a big waste of time.

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,280
But the real story here is how the Mouse event was covered on The View.

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,300
Now, I don't know a single person who actually watches The View, and I haven't seen an episode

25
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,600
of it since I lived at my parents' place, because as far as I recall, my mom loved that

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
shit.

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,480
And you know what, I kind of forgot it existed, until Whoopi Goldberg got in trouble for this

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
comment.

29
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,160
Also, if you're going to do this, then let's be truthful about it, because the Holocaust

30
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,560
isn't about race.

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
What?

32
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
No.

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,640
It's not about race, but it's, it's not about race.

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,960
It's not about race, because it's about man's inhumanity to man.

35
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
Okay.

36
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,320
Okay, she's technically correct.

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,320
The Holocaust was about man's inhumanity to man, but it's also about race.

38
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
Do you see this book here?

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
I fucking read it.

40
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
There's a lot in here about race.

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
I don't know what you're fucking talking about, dude.

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
That's what it's about.

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
But it's about white supremacy.

44
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, it's not about race, but these are two white groups of people.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And there's the rub.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,260
This is a very American viewpoint on race that Whoopi Goldberg is presenting here.

47
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,160
She considers Jews to be white, and so to her, the Holocaust is simply white on white

48
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
crime.

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,700
But that's not how the people involved in the Holocaust sought Hitler.

50
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,720
You know, in that book, he doesn't actually talk about the white race.

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,180
He talks about the Germanic race, the Aryan race, the Nordic race, and their relationships

52
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,680
with the Slavic race, or the Mediterranean race, or the Jewish race.

53
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,880
All groups of people that we overhear in North America generally lumped together as white,

54
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,840
but to Nazi racial ideology, they were not considered part of the same stock.

55
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,400
Well, they didn't have to feed them as white businesses.

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,000
But you're missing the point.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're missing the point.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,040
The minute you turn it into race, it goes down this alley.

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,880
Let's talk about it for what it is.

60
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,960
It's how people treat each other.

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
It's a problem.

62
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,600
It doesn't matter if you're black or white, because black, white, Jews, everybody eats

63
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
each other.

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,280
To Whoopi's credit, she's actually correct here.

65
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,000
Every group of people on earth is both an oppressor and the oppressed.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,180
That's just how it is.

67
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,340
So is it, if you're uncomfortable, if you hear about Maus, should you be worried?

68
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,440
Should your child say, oh my God, I wonder if that's me?

69
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,120
No, that's not what they're going to say.

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,520
They're going to say, I don't want to be like that.

71
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,480
The music coming in to try and play it off.

72
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,040
Not happening this time, Sam.

73
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
Well, hopefully.

74
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,400
I don't want to be cool.

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,240
Most kids, most kids, they don't want to be cool.

76
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
No, they don't.

77
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:39,180
We're living in an era where people are comparing vaccine cards to the yellow stars, where people

78
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,920
are comparing vaccinations to what Anne Frank went through.

79
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,080
So it is necessary for kids to learn about.

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,120
Yeah, it's not at that level.

81
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,800
Let's hope it ever gets there, lady.

82
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,460
Thankfully, it's turning around in most places.

83
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,060
But there's still that one school making kids wear yellow stars if they've got a medical

84
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,300
exemption for masks.

85
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,300
Jesus.

86
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:03,500
To learn about man's inhumanity to man, however it exposes itself, I have to cut you off.

87
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,740
I just want to say that Maus was banned and it flew to top 20 of Amazon's rules last thing.

88
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,740
Of charts.

89
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,740
Yes.

90
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,380
The more you ban it, the more we want to read it.

91
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,380
And there you have it.

92
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,380
What a shit show, eh?

93
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,860
The problem here isn't that Whoopi Goldberg is hateful or anything, though, I mean, maybe.

94
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,880
It's that she's operating with a very specific, very narrow lens on race that leads to her

95
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,500
saying such dumb shit as, the Holocaust wasn't about race, because the American experience

96
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,540
on race is extremely black and white.

97
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,540
Literally, in fact.

98
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,180
From the Nazi perspective, it was Semites versus Aryans.

99
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,320
They felt no kinship with them based on skin color.

100
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,940
Of course, Whoopi Goldberg went on to apologize on Twitter.

101
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,260
Is that a new avatar?

102
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,760
I will say it fits the situation.

103
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,060
On today's show, I said the Holocaust is not about race, but about man's inhumanity to

104
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,060
man.

105
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,260
It's about both.

106
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,340
As Jonathan Greenblatt from the Anti-Defamation League shared, the Holocaust was about the

107
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,180
Nazi systematic annihilation of the Jewish people, who they deemed to be in an inferior

108
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,180
race.

109
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,180
I stand corrected.

110
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,700
The Jewish people around the world have always had my support, and that will never waver.

111
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,420
I am sorry for the hurt I've caused.

112
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,180
What quickly followed was a series of funny and weird events, starting with the president

113
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,400
of ABC suspending Whoopi Goldberg from The View for two weeks, stating, while Whoopi

114
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,220
has apologized, I have asked her to take time to reflect and learn about the impact

115
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,220
of her comments.

116
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,380
The entire ABC news organization stands in solidarity with our Jewish colleagues, friends,

117
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,700
family, and communities.

118
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,020
Whoopi responded by wearing a jacket that had innocent printed on it, even though she

119
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,300
had already apologized.

120
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,300
Alright.

121
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,740
People also began to take note of the obvious hypocrisy.

122
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,940
In March of 2021, Sharon Osborn was invited to leave her position on CBS's The Talk

123
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,440
over accusations of racism, for defending Piers Morgan's criticisms of Meghan Markle.

124
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,040
In 2018, Roseanne Barr had her show canceled off of ABC after sending this, uh, pretty

125
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,680
spicy tweet about Valerie Jarrett, one of Obama's advisors.

126
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,320
If the Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes had a baby, Jesus.

127
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm sure her supporting Trump didn't help either.

128
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,280
And of course, Gia Serrano was let go from her star role on Lucasfilm's The Mandalorian

129
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,760
for stating that being a Republican today is like being Jewish during the Holocaust.

130
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,360
Me personally, I don't want to see any of these people fired.

131
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,600
I like free speech, but considering that CBS, ABC, and Lucasfilm are all owned by Disney,

132
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,800
it's not like there's a difference where the buck stops.

133
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,440
Osborn, Barr, and Serrano all said some pretty bad stuff, but none of it is as bad as Holocaust

134
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,560
revisionism.

135
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,960
And yet, unlike those three, Whoopi Goldberg only got a slap on the wrist.

136
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,480
Maybe it's because she's black, and her blackness affords her an extra level of protection in

137
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,420
a CRT intersectional world.

138
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,200
Maybe it's because she's characterized the Holocaust as being whites against whites.

139
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,400
And so from a black perspective, what does she care?

140
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,580
That's also valid from the CRT point of view.

141
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,560
In fact, she said exactly that when talking to Stephen Colbert.

142
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,120
Like, asking the Nazis, they would say, yes, it's a racial issue.

143
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,040
Well, see, this is what's interesting to me, because the Nazis lied.

144
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,200
It wasn't.

145
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:59,840
They they had issues with ethnicity, not with race, because most of the Nazis were white

146
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,600
people and most of the people they were attacking were white people.

147
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,880
So to me, I'm thinking, how can you how can you say it's about race if you are fighting

148
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,000
each other?

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,680
So it all really began because I said, how will children how will we explain to children

150
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,340
what happened in Nazi Germany?

151
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,120
This wasn't I said, this wasn't racial.

152
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,520
This was about white on white.

153
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,240
Back in November of 2021, Goldberg had another spicy conversation on The View, though this

154
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,480
one flew under the radar.

155
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,640
This time, it's a discussion about the Virginia election and how critical race theory was

156
00:07:34,640 --> 00:08:00,480
impacting the race.

157
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,840
It is college level stuff, at least it was when I went to university.

158
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,960
When I was younger, intro to critical theory was a first year course, but it's certainly

159
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,480
not only law school, it's an offer for anybody.

160
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,880
The discipline may have started as critical legal theory, but it's expanded far beyond

161
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
that.

162
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,880
And hey, who knows?

163
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,200
Maybe it's wormed its way into high schools by now.

164
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:25,760
I know that at least gender studies has.

165
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,200
Yes, but you know, you live in the United States, you know, that color of skin has been

166
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,280
mattering to people can't we change it that it was weak, we need white people to step

167
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
up and do that.

168
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,160
But I think that we they've been doing that since the Civil War.

169
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,000
And I'm not saying no, no, no.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,720
My God, whoopee.

171
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,000
Do you think the Civil War was blacks versus whites?

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,720
Do you think no white blood was shed to end slavery in America, this idea that everything

173
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,920
is whitey's fault, and everything bad is white and everything good is black has got

174
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
to fucking stop?

175
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,920
It's legitimately racist.

176
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:21,680
Yeah, was, where is it okay now whoopee?

177
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,080
This is fucking crazy, dude.

178
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,000
You're so married to your own trauma.

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,480
And let's not pretend here that you've experienced any of it since you got rich, that you would

180
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,440
rather see the trauma perpetuated instead of actually solving problems, because solving

181
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,400
problems means you can no longer perpetually blame white people for whatever ails you.

182
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,620
Race is defined as a category of humankind that shares certain distinctive physical traits.

183
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,640
Ethnicity is defined as the fact or state of belonging to a social group as a common

184
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,520
national or cultural tradition.

185
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,320
There is an overlap there, sure, but they're not the same thing.

186
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,040
Regarding the American experience, white and black skin are so visually distinct, it's

187
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,160
easy to conceptualize racial groups at a quick glance.

188
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,100
But when Whoopee Goldberg says that the Holocaust is white on white, and it's about ethnicity,

189
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,460
not race, she's wrong.

190
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,320
It looks that way to her because she's an American intersectionalist, but it's not the

191
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,720
fact of the matter.

192
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,840
Nazi race science explicitly relied on distinctive physical traits with distinct religious, cultural,

193
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,600
linguistic and territorial similarities of ethnicity taking a back burner.

194
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,820
That's why they focus so much on semantic racial traits, like darker skin and hair,

195
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,560
or curly hair, or larger noses.

196
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,640
Whenever you see pictures of those German doctors measuring the width of somebody's

197
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,140
nose or the size of their skulls, they're not appealing to ethnicity, they're appealing

198
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,140
to race.

199
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,460
So yes, Whoopee Goldberg is just wrong, but the reason she sticks with such a bizarre

200
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,420
view is because of critical theory.

201
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,640
I will have to eventually cover that shitshow in depth at some point on this channel.

202
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,680
But here's the sky high CRT view.

203
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,920
The overarching intersectional view of the world is that the white 1% control institutions

204
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,600
and governments in order to uphold a global system of capitalist patriarchal white supremacy,

205
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,240
and that even if individual white people don't agree with it or have anything to do with

206
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,880
it, they still benefit from it and victimize non-whites as oppressors.

207
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,560
Meanwhile, Nazi ideology believed that a small minority of rich Jews, without a nation-state

208
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,680
of their own, controlled institutions and governments across Europe to uphold a capitalist

209
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:14,540
system of Jewish supremacy, where even individual innocent Jews benefited and victimized non-Jews.

210
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,280
Does this sound familiar?

211
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,440
Oh, also, as Whoopee said earlier, the intersectional view is that Jews are in fact white.

212
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,420
No wonder she's so flippant about the Holocaust.

213
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,840
A lot has been said recently about the prevalence of black-on-Jew crime in America, and about

214
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,640
the rise of people like Louis Farrakhan, the anti-Semitic black supremacist.

215
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,460
A lot has been said about the anti-Semitism on the broader left, with the UK's Labour

216
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,840
Party being full of it, with the socialists routinely noticing that their globalist 1%

217
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,640
bourgeoisie has a lot of heavy overlap with the Nazis internationalist Jewish banker class.

218
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,280
Moreover, it's not hard at all to find prominent Jewish leftists who call themselves white

219
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,780
when it's time to publicly denigrate themselves as oppressors, and who call themselves Jewish

220
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,560
when it's time to present themselves as victims of a hate crime.

221
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,240
Of course, all of these people conveniently ignore that black Jews exist.

222
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,920
Some of the more extremist elements in Israel even go so far as to say that they're not

223
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
real Jews.

224
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,920
Hell, back in 2011 Whoopee Goldberg herself claimed she was Jewish, that's a twist.

225
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,600
Way to throw your own Jewish in-group under the bus for your black in-group, lady.

226
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,160
Wait a minute, actually she didn't even stand up for her black in-group either, because

227
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,760
damn she's laughing on a white guy who does blackface.

228
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,000
And she's standing up for pedophiles too?

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What the fuck?

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,360
I guess the TLDR on Whoopee Goldberg is that she's just a fucking moron.

231
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,640
But the ideology guiding her, that's what's worth talking about.

232
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,640
It brought her to this ridiculous point of saying that everybody is racist except the

233
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Nazis.

234
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,800
That was just white on white.

235
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,360
Would she feel the same way about the Rwandan genocide, since it was one black group killing

236
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
another black group?

237
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,540
Or how about the Japanese and Nanking, that's just Asian on Asian.

238
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,420
The ultimate issue with critical race theory framing is that it requires white people to

239
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,820
always be the evil oppressor due to institutionalized power.

240
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,620
And so blacks can't be racist, they're just punching up.

241
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,440
Anybody with their head on straight knows exactly how dumb this sounds.

242
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,200
Even they know how dumb it sounds.

243
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,620
The ADL is a garbage organization, but for a long time their definition of racism was

244
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,240
the belief that a particular race is superior or inferior to another.

245
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,780
As the ADL moved away from the liberal ideal and regressed into the tribalism of intersectionality,

246
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:14,060
they changed that definition to the marginalization and or oppression of people of color based

247
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,480
on a socially constructed racial hierarchy that privileges white people.

248
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,400
And under this view, Whoopi is actually correct.

249
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,780
The Nazis weren't racist because their actions oppressed whites, not people of color and

250
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,180
privileged Germans, not all whites.

251
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,940
The critical theory view, the intersectional view has to be pro Nazi.

252
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,780
After the Whoopi Goldberg shit show hit the fan, the ADL changed the page to an interim

253
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,380
definition, basically admitting that this was temporary just to get people to shut up.

254
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,900
Racism occurs when individuals or institutions show more favorable evaluation or treatment

255
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,180
of an individual or group based on race or ethnicity.

256
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,300
Expect this definition to vanish after the storm has passed.

257
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,600
CRT is legitimately racist.

258
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,700
Intersectionality is absolutely bigoted.

259
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,820
That doesn't mean that you need these things to be racist or bigoted.

260
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,260
The old style white supremacy can still exist, but you have to be a moron to think that nowadays

261
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,880
it's actually ascendant.

262
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,700
Most people today are just centrist liberal types.

263
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,040
They genuinely want people to be judged on the content of their character and not the

264
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
color of their skin.

265
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,820
But that completely reasonable desire, that trend towards individualism, is why progressives

266
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,460
screech racism every time and it's why Whoopi Goldberg can get away with minimizing the

267
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,500
Holocaust along racial lines.

268
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,540
When they cry racist, they're calling you what they are and they're expecting you

269
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,900
to be shamed for your reasonable opinions when their direct actions are infinitely worse.
