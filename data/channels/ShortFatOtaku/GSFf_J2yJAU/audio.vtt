00:00.000 --> 00:10.380
3. What is it that gives the police legitimacy? It's an important question. The general

00:10.380 --> 00:14.900
lefty position is that the cops are pigs, and yeah, I can see why. It's not hard to

00:14.900 --> 00:19.980
find instances of legitimate police brutality. And the police in question is the one thing

00:19.980 --> 00:24.660
that the left gets consistently correct. The problem, of course, lies in the left's proposed

00:24.660 --> 00:29.780
solutions. You can't defund the police without crime skyrocketing, and no society can exist

00:29.780 --> 00:33.660
entirely without a watchman, no matter how many anarchist idiots you read who say that

00:33.660 --> 00:38.660
it can. Eventually, somebody, somewhere, has to be the person that uses force to keep the

00:38.660 --> 00:42.600
peace. So we have to ask, what makes that force legitimate?

00:42.600 --> 00:46.340
The Brits seem to have it right. It's the consent of the governed that makes policing

00:46.340 --> 00:49.860
legitimate. And consent of the governed means that there should be restrictions on police

00:49.860 --> 00:53.940
power. I know Americans love their castle doctrine, but it's originally a British

00:53.940 --> 00:58.820
idea. Sir Edward Coke, in The Institutes of the Laws of England, wrote, For a man's

00:58.820 --> 01:03.900
house is his castle, and each man's home is his safest refuge. Later, castle was defined

01:03.900 --> 01:08.740
in this passage, The poorest man may, in his cottage, bid defiance to all the forces of

01:08.740 --> 01:14.380
the crown. It may be frail, its roof may shake, the wind may blow through it, the storm may

01:14.380 --> 01:17.980
enter, the rain may enter, but the King of England cannot enter.

01:17.980 --> 01:22.320
Castle doctrine applies, rightly so, to the home invader. And yes, I do think it's moral

01:22.320 --> 01:25.440
to kill a person who has broken into your house in the middle of the night. I've met

01:25.440 --> 01:29.240
more than a few sniveling socialists who cannot possibly comprehend this position.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.920
And I can only think that's because they've never had a woman sleeping next to them in

01:32.920 --> 01:35.720
bed. But more importantly, castle doctrine applies

01:35.720 --> 01:40.520
to the state. On some level, the state really is a leviathan. Its bureaucracy, its position

01:40.520 --> 01:44.880
as a peacekeeper, means that no matter if you rebuff the state's agents temporarily,

01:44.880 --> 01:48.880
no matter if you elude them for a day, they are not the common robber. They will continue

01:48.880 --> 01:53.680
to pursue you until you're caught. So it is restriction on that pursuit that is necessary.

01:53.840 --> 01:59.600
A totalitarian state will use its police powers to suppress dissidents who, by any reasonable

01:59.600 --> 02:04.280
metric, have done nothing wrong. A liberal state will use its police powers to apprehend

02:04.280 --> 02:09.980
lawbreakers. And yet, they will often wield the same force in the same ways. In fact,

02:09.980 --> 02:14.500
sometimes there are instances in which the police of the liberal state opt to use less

02:14.500 --> 02:19.920
lethal means to do their jobs. When the left objects to the police, they do so based on

02:19.920 --> 02:24.840
this surface-level reasoning. That the jackboot stomping on the protester, and the policemen

02:24.840 --> 02:30.280
apprehending the murderer, both must use force. And so they are both objectionable.

02:30.280 --> 02:35.040
It is only the most naive among them who actually hate the concept of force itself. As their

02:35.040 --> 02:40.800
activists have shown us, most of them would and do wield force when given the opportunity.

02:40.800 --> 02:45.400
But it is not only when the police use their powers that gives them legitimacy, it is also

02:45.400 --> 02:48.440
when they fail to use them. We've been talking about the Brits, so let's look at their

02:48.440 --> 02:52.760
police force. They're known for not carrying guns regularly, though they obviously have

02:52.760 --> 02:56.500
access to them if they're needed. They've also sometimes got those tall hats that Americans

02:56.500 --> 03:00.140
like to poke fun at. Did you know that there's an old British law still in effect? That if

03:00.140 --> 03:04.520
a pregnant woman urgently needs to pee, the officer is required to give her his hat to

03:04.520 --> 03:08.440
do it into if there's no washroom around? But that's not the only way the cops are

03:08.440 --> 03:13.760
taking the piss right now. Check this out. We were alerted to a series of racist messages

03:13.760 --> 03:18.440
sent to a footballer today, and after looking into them and conducting checks, we have arrested

03:18.440 --> 03:23.560
a boy. The 12-year-old has been taken into custody. Thanks to everyone who raised it,

03:23.560 --> 03:28.040
racism won't be tolerated. So the cops in Britbongistan are arresting kids for dropping

03:28.040 --> 03:32.920
gamer words online. Your society must be truly safe if your police have so little to do,

03:32.920 --> 03:37.020
they actually have to fill their timesheet with garbage like this. We've received reports

03:37.020 --> 03:41.680
of a number of transphobic comments being posted on social media. We take all reports

03:41.680 --> 03:46.000
of hate incidents seriously. You know that it's not only British people who use Twitter,

03:46.000 --> 03:51.240
but in reply to it, you didn't investigate my brother's flat when I told you I had

03:51.240 --> 03:56.000
concerns about his wellbeing. You told me you didn't have the resources. Two days

03:56.000 --> 04:01.360
later a neighbour found his body. I wish I'd told you he'd liked a limerick on Facebook,

04:01.360 --> 04:06.280
you useless bastards. I'm afraid that this sort of thing is going to be a recurring theme.

04:06.280 --> 04:12.440
UK police accuse man of playing racist music. UK police tell man to check his thinking after

04:12.440 --> 04:18.720
making a transphobic retweet. Women guilty of hate crime for posting rap lyrics online.

04:18.720 --> 04:22.320
And don't get me started on all the videos we've seen of police randomly breaching

04:22.320 --> 04:28.020
people's homes and investigating them without probable cause for COVID lockdown violations.

04:28.020 --> 04:32.840
It seems like the UK police are letting actual crimes go uninvestigated, actual people in

04:32.840 --> 04:39.120
need go unhelped, so that they can staff online hate incident monitoring teams and other such

04:39.120 --> 04:43.280
nonsense. But hey, that's not all they do. They also like to confiscate weapons. Look

04:43.280 --> 04:47.880
at all these deadly objects. It's a bunch of kitchen knives, which, despite their status

04:47.880 --> 04:51.240
as a tool, you can certainly kill somebody with. There's a fencing sword, alright. There's

04:51.240 --> 04:55.460
a spoon in there too. I guess if you wanted to gouge somebody's eyes out. This one looks

04:55.460 --> 04:59.780
like they simply swiped somebody's toolbox. Hell, these guys have even mistaken leaks

04:59.780 --> 05:03.700
for machetes at one point. I know you can equip your Farfetch'd with one to increase

05:03.700 --> 05:08.220
its critical hit chance, but come on guys. Of course, considering that people do in fact

05:08.220 --> 05:13.140
need things like knives, the UK has decided to just start selling blunt ones. I can't

05:13.140 --> 05:17.920
believe I have to say this, but any tool can be used to hurt people, because tools are

05:17.920 --> 05:23.700
used to cut things, punch holes through things, pound things, attach things to other things,

05:23.700 --> 05:28.140
and those are all useful functions when done to inanimate objects, but painful when done

05:28.140 --> 05:33.600
to a human. Unless you want to outlaw cooking and craftsmanship and a million other things,

05:33.600 --> 05:37.440
you're not going to be able to stop this. A rock is a weapon. Are you going to confiscate

05:37.440 --> 05:41.520
all the rocks too? You want them to seize a scooter because there's no license? Why

05:41.520 --> 05:45.640
not? Even though there's no reason that such a scooter should even need a license. Want

05:45.640 --> 05:50.400
them to go after gay people because free speech is Islamophobic? Why not? If you're gay in

05:50.400 --> 05:54.280
public you're probably racist nowadays. You want them to actually investigate a stalker?

05:54.280 --> 05:59.080
Nah, they probably can't do that. In fact, they'll fine you for asking them to investigate

05:59.080 --> 06:02.980
your stalker, and then let the stalker kill you, because they're completely incompetent

06:02.980 --> 06:06.720
at their jobs. They're not so incompetent though, that if you decide to throw just the

06:06.720 --> 06:10.760
slightest bit of shade at an elected official on Twitter, deserved shade because they've

06:10.760 --> 06:14.100
said something monumentally stupid, that of course the cops are going to come after you

06:14.100 --> 06:18.940
for it. Read this again guys. This person is so mad that a pleb had the audacity to

06:18.940 --> 06:23.820
call their system a regime, that she demands the police be sicked on him, exactly as a

06:23.820 --> 06:28.400
regime would demand. Policing in the UK is no longer based on law, and it's certainly

06:28.400 --> 06:33.280
not based on common sense. They spend immense resources on ridiculous disarmament programs

06:33.280 --> 06:38.120
that fetch kitchenware and carpentry tools, while ignoring actual violence due to the

06:38.120 --> 06:43.280
colour of the attacker's skin. They prowl the online space, looking for hate speech,

06:43.280 --> 06:47.160
while rapists and groomers get hand-waved away, because the police don't want to look

06:47.160 --> 06:51.760
culturally insensitive. They'll take the knee for Black Lives Matter, they'll ignore the

06:51.760 --> 06:56.480
environmentalists who block traffic and city services. But when regular ordinary people

06:56.480 --> 07:01.600
protest coronavirus lockdowns, they arrive not with funny hats and pride flags, but beat

07:01.600 --> 07:05.480
sticks and riot shields. At the start of this video, I mentioned that the one thing

07:05.480 --> 07:10.300
the left actually gets right is its opposition to the police. And right now, there's a series

07:10.300 --> 07:14.640
of kill-the-bill protests happening in the UK, as a reaction to the government trying

07:14.640 --> 07:19.740
to pass a bill that expands police power to stifle protests. And as a person that actually

07:19.740 --> 07:24.600
would go to a lockdown protest, if my area of the world wasn't full of people largely

07:24.600 --> 07:29.720
ignoring lockdowns anyway, the only thing I have to say is, first time? Yes, the cops

07:29.720 --> 07:34.160
are brutalizing these kill-the-bill protesters. And yes, the protesters are predominantly

07:34.160 --> 07:38.400
leftists. The problem with leftist anti-police action is that their vision for what comes

07:38.400 --> 07:43.040
next is just as bad as having a corrupt police force around. But that doesn't mean that we

07:43.040 --> 07:47.240
should tolerate a corrupt police force. And that is exactly what the UK police are. They

07:47.240 --> 07:51.280
wield their power for political purposes, and in a clearly biased way. Fundamentally,

07:51.280 --> 07:55.080
they're still the unlikely allies of the idpol left, because it's not the left protesting

07:55.080 --> 07:59.260
covid lockdowns, it's not the left wanting free speech anymore, they're crying for safety

07:59.300 --> 08:03.780
at all costs. And those leftists who have actually entered the fray against the police

08:03.780 --> 08:08.140
are doing so because they wish they were the police themselves. In the end, the UK's police

08:08.140 --> 08:13.060
force has become institutionally anti-liberal, and it's long past time that the British oppose

08:13.060 --> 08:16.820
them through whatever avenues they have. When they are wasting the resources that they glean

08:16.820 --> 08:21.180
from productive society on this nonsense, rather than actually stopping criminals, you're

08:21.180 --> 08:24.860
better off using your money not on your taxes, but on a gun.

08:24.860 --> 08:28.940
Thank you for watching, my friends. If you enjoyed this video, please feel free to share

08:33.620 --> 08:37.500
like, I don't know. Sub for more, or hit up my Patreon or Subscribestar if you want

08:37.500 --> 08:40.960
to keep it coming. And be sure to stick around, because I'm putting up a new video every

08:40.960 --> 08:43.860
single day. So, I'll see you tomorrow. I love you.
