1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,380
3. What is it that gives the police legitimacy? It's an important question. The general

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,900
lefty position is that the cops are pigs, and yeah, I can see why. It's not hard to

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,980
find instances of legitimate police brutality. And the police in question is the one thing

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,660
that the left gets consistently correct. The problem, of course, lies in the left's proposed

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,780
solutions. You can't defund the police without crime skyrocketing, and no society can exist

6
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,660
entirely without a watchman, no matter how many anarchist idiots you read who say that

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,660
it can. Eventually, somebody, somewhere, has to be the person that uses force to keep the

8
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,600
peace. So we have to ask, what makes that force legitimate?

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,340
The Brits seem to have it right. It's the consent of the governed that makes policing

10
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,860
legitimate. And consent of the governed means that there should be restrictions on police

11
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,940
power. I know Americans love their castle doctrine, but it's originally a British

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,820
idea. Sir Edward Coke, in The Institutes of the Laws of England, wrote, For a man's

13
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,900
house is his castle, and each man's home is his safest refuge. Later, castle was defined

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,740
in this passage, The poorest man may, in his cottage, bid defiance to all the forces of

15
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:14,380
the crown. It may be frail, its roof may shake, the wind may blow through it, the storm may

16
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,980
enter, the rain may enter, but the King of England cannot enter.

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,320
Castle doctrine applies, rightly so, to the home invader. And yes, I do think it's moral

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,440
to kill a person who has broken into your house in the middle of the night. I've met

19
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,240
more than a few sniveling socialists who cannot possibly comprehend this position.

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,920
And I can only think that's because they've never had a woman sleeping next to them in

21
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,720
bed. But more importantly, castle doctrine applies

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,520
to the state. On some level, the state really is a leviathan. Its bureaucracy, its position

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,880
as a peacekeeper, means that no matter if you rebuff the state's agents temporarily,

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
no matter if you elude them for a day, they are not the common robber. They will continue

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,680
to pursue you until you're caught. So it is restriction on that pursuit that is necessary.

26
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,600
A totalitarian state will use its police powers to suppress dissidents who, by any reasonable

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,280
metric, have done nothing wrong. A liberal state will use its police powers to apprehend

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,980
lawbreakers. And yet, they will often wield the same force in the same ways. In fact,

29
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:14,500
sometimes there are instances in which the police of the liberal state opt to use less

30
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,920
lethal means to do their jobs. When the left objects to the police, they do so based on

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,840
this surface-level reasoning. That the jackboot stomping on the protester, and the policemen

32
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,280
apprehending the murderer, both must use force. And so they are both objectionable.

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,040
It is only the most naive among them who actually hate the concept of force itself. As their

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,800
activists have shown us, most of them would and do wield force when given the opportunity.

35
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,400
But it is not only when the police use their powers that gives them legitimacy, it is also

36
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,440
when they fail to use them. We've been talking about the Brits, so let's look at their

37
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,760
police force. They're known for not carrying guns regularly, though they obviously have

38
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,500
access to them if they're needed. They've also sometimes got those tall hats that Americans

39
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,140
like to poke fun at. Did you know that there's an old British law still in effect? That if

40
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,520
a pregnant woman urgently needs to pee, the officer is required to give her his hat to

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,440
do it into if there's no washroom around? But that's not the only way the cops are

42
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,760
taking the piss right now. Check this out. We were alerted to a series of racist messages

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,440
sent to a footballer today, and after looking into them and conducting checks, we have arrested

44
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,560
a boy. The 12-year-old has been taken into custody. Thanks to everyone who raised it,

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,040
racism won't be tolerated. So the cops in Britbongistan are arresting kids for dropping

46
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,920
gamer words online. Your society must be truly safe if your police have so little to do,

47
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,020
they actually have to fill their timesheet with garbage like this. We've received reports

48
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,680
of a number of transphobic comments being posted on social media. We take all reports

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,000
of hate incidents seriously. You know that it's not only British people who use Twitter,

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,240
but in reply to it, you didn't investigate my brother's flat when I told you I had

51
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,000
concerns about his wellbeing. You told me you didn't have the resources. Two days

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,360
later a neighbour found his body. I wish I'd told you he'd liked a limerick on Facebook,

53
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,280
you useless bastards. I'm afraid that this sort of thing is going to be a recurring theme.

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,440
UK police accuse man of playing racist music. UK police tell man to check his thinking after

55
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,720
making a transphobic retweet. Women guilty of hate crime for posting rap lyrics online.

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,320
And don't get me started on all the videos we've seen of police randomly breaching

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,020
people's homes and investigating them without probable cause for COVID lockdown violations.

58
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,840
It seems like the UK police are letting actual crimes go uninvestigated, actual people in

59
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,120
need go unhelped, so that they can staff online hate incident monitoring teams and other such

60
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,280
nonsense. But hey, that's not all they do. They also like to confiscate weapons. Look

61
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,880
at all these deadly objects. It's a bunch of kitchen knives, which, despite their status

62
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,240
as a tool, you can certainly kill somebody with. There's a fencing sword, alright. There's

63
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,460
a spoon in there too. I guess if you wanted to gouge somebody's eyes out. This one looks

64
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,780
like they simply swiped somebody's toolbox. Hell, these guys have even mistaken leaks

65
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,700
for machetes at one point. I know you can equip your Farfetch'd with one to increase

66
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,220
its critical hit chance, but come on guys. Of course, considering that people do in fact

67
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,140
need things like knives, the UK has decided to just start selling blunt ones. I can't

68
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,920
believe I have to say this, but any tool can be used to hurt people, because tools are

69
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,700
used to cut things, punch holes through things, pound things, attach things to other things,

70
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,140
and those are all useful functions when done to inanimate objects, but painful when done

71
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,600
to a human. Unless you want to outlaw cooking and craftsmanship and a million other things,

72
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,440
you're not going to be able to stop this. A rock is a weapon. Are you going to confiscate

73
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,520
all the rocks too? You want them to seize a scooter because there's no license? Why

74
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,640
not? Even though there's no reason that such a scooter should even need a license. Want

75
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,400
them to go after gay people because free speech is Islamophobic? Why not? If you're gay in

76
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,280
public you're probably racist nowadays. You want them to actually investigate a stalker?

77
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,080
Nah, they probably can't do that. In fact, they'll fine you for asking them to investigate

78
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,980
your stalker, and then let the stalker kill you, because they're completely incompetent

79
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,720
at their jobs. They're not so incompetent though, that if you decide to throw just the

80
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,760
slightest bit of shade at an elected official on Twitter, deserved shade because they've

81
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,100
said something monumentally stupid, that of course the cops are going to come after you

82
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,940
for it. Read this again guys. This person is so mad that a pleb had the audacity to

83
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,820
call their system a regime, that she demands the police be sicked on him, exactly as a

84
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,400
regime would demand. Policing in the UK is no longer based on law, and it's certainly

85
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,280
not based on common sense. They spend immense resources on ridiculous disarmament programs

86
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,120
that fetch kitchenware and carpentry tools, while ignoring actual violence due to the

87
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,280
colour of the attacker's skin. They prowl the online space, looking for hate speech,

88
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,160
while rapists and groomers get hand-waved away, because the police don't want to look

89
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,760
culturally insensitive. They'll take the knee for Black Lives Matter, they'll ignore the

90
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,480
environmentalists who block traffic and city services. But when regular ordinary people

91
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,600
protest coronavirus lockdowns, they arrive not with funny hats and pride flags, but beat

92
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,480
sticks and riot shields. At the start of this video, I mentioned that the one thing

93
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,300
the left actually gets right is its opposition to the police. And right now, there's a series

94
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,640
of kill-the-bill protests happening in the UK, as a reaction to the government trying

95
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,740
to pass a bill that expands police power to stifle protests. And as a person that actually

96
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,600
would go to a lockdown protest, if my area of the world wasn't full of people largely

97
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,720
ignoring lockdowns anyway, the only thing I have to say is, first time? Yes, the cops

98
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,160
are brutalizing these kill-the-bill protesters. And yes, the protesters are predominantly

99
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,400
leftists. The problem with leftist anti-police action is that their vision for what comes

100
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,040
next is just as bad as having a corrupt police force around. But that doesn't mean that we

101
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,240
should tolerate a corrupt police force. And that is exactly what the UK police are. They

102
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,280
wield their power for political purposes, and in a clearly biased way. Fundamentally,

103
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,080
they're still the unlikely allies of the idpol left, because it's not the left protesting

104
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,260
covid lockdowns, it's not the left wanting free speech anymore, they're crying for safety

105
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,780
at all costs. And those leftists who have actually entered the fray against the police

106
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,140
are doing so because they wish they were the police themselves. In the end, the UK's police

107
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:13,060
force has become institutionally anti-liberal, and it's long past time that the British oppose

108
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,820
them through whatever avenues they have. When they are wasting the resources that they glean

109
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,180
from productive society on this nonsense, rather than actually stopping criminals, you're

110
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,860
better off using your money not on your taxes, but on a gun.

111
