0	10380	3. What is it that gives the police legitimacy? It's an important question. The general
10380	14900	lefty position is that the cops are pigs, and yeah, I can see why. It's not hard to
14900	19980	find instances of legitimate police brutality. And the police in question is the one thing
19980	24660	that the left gets consistently correct. The problem, of course, lies in the left's proposed
24660	29780	solutions. You can't defund the police without crime skyrocketing, and no society can exist
29780	33660	entirely without a watchman, no matter how many anarchist idiots you read who say that
33660	38660	it can. Eventually, somebody, somewhere, has to be the person that uses force to keep the
38660	42600	peace. So we have to ask, what makes that force legitimate?
42600	46340	The Brits seem to have it right. It's the consent of the governed that makes policing
46340	49860	legitimate. And consent of the governed means that there should be restrictions on police
49860	53940	power. I know Americans love their castle doctrine, but it's originally a British
53940	58820	idea. Sir Edward Coke, in The Institutes of the Laws of England, wrote, For a man's
58820	63900	house is his castle, and each man's home is his safest refuge. Later, castle was defined
63900	68740	in this passage, The poorest man may, in his cottage, bid defiance to all the forces of
68740	74380	the crown. It may be frail, its roof may shake, the wind may blow through it, the storm may
74380	77980	enter, the rain may enter, but the King of England cannot enter.
77980	82320	Castle doctrine applies, rightly so, to the home invader. And yes, I do think it's moral
82320	85440	to kill a person who has broken into your house in the middle of the night. I've met
85440	89240	more than a few sniveling socialists who cannot possibly comprehend this position.
89240	92920	And I can only think that's because they've never had a woman sleeping next to them in
92920	95720	bed. But more importantly, castle doctrine applies
95720	100520	to the state. On some level, the state really is a leviathan. Its bureaucracy, its position
100520	104880	as a peacekeeper, means that no matter if you rebuff the state's agents temporarily,
104880	108880	no matter if you elude them for a day, they are not the common robber. They will continue
108880	113680	to pursue you until you're caught. So it is restriction on that pursuit that is necessary.
113840	119600	A totalitarian state will use its police powers to suppress dissidents who, by any reasonable
119600	124280	metric, have done nothing wrong. A liberal state will use its police powers to apprehend
124280	129980	lawbreakers. And yet, they will often wield the same force in the same ways. In fact,
129980	134500	sometimes there are instances in which the police of the liberal state opt to use less
134500	139920	lethal means to do their jobs. When the left objects to the police, they do so based on
139920	144840	this surface-level reasoning. That the jackboot stomping on the protester, and the policemen
144840	150280	apprehending the murderer, both must use force. And so they are both objectionable.
150280	155040	It is only the most naive among them who actually hate the concept of force itself. As their
155040	160800	activists have shown us, most of them would and do wield force when given the opportunity.
160800	165400	But it is not only when the police use their powers that gives them legitimacy, it is also
165400	168440	when they fail to use them. We've been talking about the Brits, so let's look at their
168440	172760	police force. They're known for not carrying guns regularly, though they obviously have
172760	176500	access to them if they're needed. They've also sometimes got those tall hats that Americans
176500	180140	like to poke fun at. Did you know that there's an old British law still in effect? That if
180140	184520	a pregnant woman urgently needs to pee, the officer is required to give her his hat to
184520	188440	do it into if there's no washroom around? But that's not the only way the cops are
188440	193760	taking the piss right now. Check this out. We were alerted to a series of racist messages
193760	198440	sent to a footballer today, and after looking into them and conducting checks, we have arrested
198440	203560	a boy. The 12-year-old has been taken into custody. Thanks to everyone who raised it,
203560	208040	racism won't be tolerated. So the cops in Britbongistan are arresting kids for dropping
208040	212920	gamer words online. Your society must be truly safe if your police have so little to do,
212920	217020	they actually have to fill their timesheet with garbage like this. We've received reports
217020	221680	of a number of transphobic comments being posted on social media. We take all reports
221680	226000	of hate incidents seriously. You know that it's not only British people who use Twitter,
226000	231240	but in reply to it, you didn't investigate my brother's flat when I told you I had
231240	236000	concerns about his wellbeing. You told me you didn't have the resources. Two days
236000	241360	later a neighbour found his body. I wish I'd told you he'd liked a limerick on Facebook,
241360	246280	you useless bastards. I'm afraid that this sort of thing is going to be a recurring theme.
246280	252440	UK police accuse man of playing racist music. UK police tell man to check his thinking after
252440	258720	making a transphobic retweet. Women guilty of hate crime for posting rap lyrics online.
258720	262320	And don't get me started on all the videos we've seen of police randomly breaching
262320	268020	people's homes and investigating them without probable cause for COVID lockdown violations.
268020	272840	It seems like the UK police are letting actual crimes go uninvestigated, actual people in
272840	279120	need go unhelped, so that they can staff online hate incident monitoring teams and other such
279120	283280	nonsense. But hey, that's not all they do. They also like to confiscate weapons. Look
283280	287880	at all these deadly objects. It's a bunch of kitchen knives, which, despite their status
287880	291240	as a tool, you can certainly kill somebody with. There's a fencing sword, alright. There's
291240	295460	a spoon in there too. I guess if you wanted to gouge somebody's eyes out. This one looks
295460	299780	like they simply swiped somebody's toolbox. Hell, these guys have even mistaken leaks
299780	303700	for machetes at one point. I know you can equip your Farfetch'd with one to increase
303700	308220	its critical hit chance, but come on guys. Of course, considering that people do in fact
308220	313140	need things like knives, the UK has decided to just start selling blunt ones. I can't
313140	317920	believe I have to say this, but any tool can be used to hurt people, because tools are
317920	323700	used to cut things, punch holes through things, pound things, attach things to other things,
323700	328140	and those are all useful functions when done to inanimate objects, but painful when done
328140	333600	to a human. Unless you want to outlaw cooking and craftsmanship and a million other things,
333600	337440	you're not going to be able to stop this. A rock is a weapon. Are you going to confiscate
337440	341520	all the rocks too? You want them to seize a scooter because there's no license? Why
341520	345640	not? Even though there's no reason that such a scooter should even need a license. Want
345640	350400	them to go after gay people because free speech is Islamophobic? Why not? If you're gay in
350400	354280	public you're probably racist nowadays. You want them to actually investigate a stalker?
354280	359080	Nah, they probably can't do that. In fact, they'll fine you for asking them to investigate
359080	362980	your stalker, and then let the stalker kill you, because they're completely incompetent
362980	366720	at their jobs. They're not so incompetent though, that if you decide to throw just the
366720	370760	slightest bit of shade at an elected official on Twitter, deserved shade because they've
370760	374100	said something monumentally stupid, that of course the cops are going to come after you
374100	378940	for it. Read this again guys. This person is so mad that a pleb had the audacity to
378940	383820	call their system a regime, that she demands the police be sicked on him, exactly as a
383820	388400	regime would demand. Policing in the UK is no longer based on law, and it's certainly
388400	393280	not based on common sense. They spend immense resources on ridiculous disarmament programs
393280	398120	that fetch kitchenware and carpentry tools, while ignoring actual violence due to the
398120	403280	colour of the attacker's skin. They prowl the online space, looking for hate speech,
403280	407160	while rapists and groomers get hand-waved away, because the police don't want to look
407160	411760	culturally insensitive. They'll take the knee for Black Lives Matter, they'll ignore the
411760	416480	environmentalists who block traffic and city services. But when regular ordinary people
416480	421600	protest coronavirus lockdowns, they arrive not with funny hats and pride flags, but beat
421600	425480	sticks and riot shields. At the start of this video, I mentioned that the one thing
425480	430300	the left actually gets right is its opposition to the police. And right now, there's a series
430300	434640	of kill-the-bill protests happening in the UK, as a reaction to the government trying
434640	439740	to pass a bill that expands police power to stifle protests. And as a person that actually
439740	444600	would go to a lockdown protest, if my area of the world wasn't full of people largely
444600	449720	ignoring lockdowns anyway, the only thing I have to say is, first time? Yes, the cops
449720	454160	are brutalizing these kill-the-bill protesters. And yes, the protesters are predominantly
454160	458400	leftists. The problem with leftist anti-police action is that their vision for what comes
458400	463040	next is just as bad as having a corrupt police force around. But that doesn't mean that we
463040	467240	should tolerate a corrupt police force. And that is exactly what the UK police are. They
467240	471280	wield their power for political purposes, and in a clearly biased way. Fundamentally,
471280	475080	they're still the unlikely allies of the idpol left, because it's not the left protesting
475080	479260	covid lockdowns, it's not the left wanting free speech anymore, they're crying for safety
479300	483780	at all costs. And those leftists who have actually entered the fray against the police
483780	488140	are doing so because they wish they were the police themselves. In the end, the UK's police
488140	493060	force has become institutionally anti-liberal, and it's long past time that the British oppose
493060	496820	them through whatever avenues they have. When they are wasting the resources that they glean
496820	501180	from productive society on this nonsense, rather than actually stopping criminals, you're
501180	504860	better off using your money not on your taxes, but on a gun.
