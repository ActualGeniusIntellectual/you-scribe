1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,120
I have a vague recollection of having done this topic before on the channel.

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,900
I think I did a video on it like 5 years ago, I don't know.

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,760
That might actually be one of the rare lost SFOs.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,820
I'll have to go shake Dave's tree to see where that one ended up.

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,820
But it's worth retreading anyway because things have gotten far worse since the last time

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,820
we talked about it.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,600
There's this dumb trend in gaming right now to judge a video game solely by its concurrent

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,600
player counts.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,120
If it sees a massive drop off of players then the game is dead.

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,560
In fact, if you were to take the Game Journal's opinion on it, every game is dead.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,560
All of them.

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
All the time.

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,440
Lost Ark peak players down more than 80% from all time high.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,520
Anthem's player count paints a very grim picture.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,040
The Division's player count has dropped 93% since launch.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,560
War Honor has now lost 95% of its player base.

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,440
Realm Royale lost more than a year ago.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,440
New World has lost more than a year ago.

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,440
Star Wars Battlefront's player count is lower.

20
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,900
Games media has this obsession with how many people are playing a game.

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,060
And I get it, you know?

22
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,520
I remember being in school playing the original World of Warcraft and a good chunk of why

23
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,320
that game was so fun was because it was a lively game.

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,740
It felt like a lived in world.

25
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,220
When you walked into Orgrimmar for the first time and saw all the other players going about

26
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,620
their business and you were this level 5 noob trying to get your first trainer quest done

27
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,200
and this level 60 in epic armor rode by on a mount, it felt like you were a single player

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,460
in a world with a bunch of moving interlocking pieces.

29
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,420
World of Warcraft was extremely well designed for its time but what gave the game its magic

30
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,420
was how popular it was and how that popularity influenced the player experience.

31
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,380
In an alternate universe where World of Warcraft never got big even if it was exactly the same

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,860
game, it would have been a lot less fun.

33
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,900
In fact, anybody who played on a dead server can attest to that.

34
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,740
Walking around any city on a server with no players feels like walking around a ghost

35
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,740
town.

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,540
Sure there are NPCs wandering around but without that human element everything just looks automated

37
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,540
and lifeless.

38
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,080
I think it's for this reason every time Blizzard announced a new server back in the day there

39
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,960
was a massive rush of people eager to experience being on the edge of the server's level ups

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
once again.

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,520
Even on a populated server if most people playing there were max level the low level

42
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,420
areas still felt like ghost towns.

43
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,980
The point I'm getting at is World of Warcraft's quality came from, at least in part, something

44
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,760
outside of the game's design.

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,880
It came from the experience of playing it with other people and so when game journos

46
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,320
publish article after article on how a game is losing players there's a subtext here.

47
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,960
Don't play this game because it's trash.

48
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
How do you know it's trash?

49
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,220
Because nobody else is playing it.

50
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,740
There's a huge problem with this logic though isn't there?

51
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,840
Like for example when they did this to Elden Ring it was considered a gigantic fucking

52
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,840
joke.

53
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,540
Elden Ring is the best game of 2022 and yet we still saw yahoos publish shit decrying

54
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,000
the game for losing 90% of its concurrent players on steam.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,720
Well yeah you dolt it's a single player experience.

56
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,740
This isn't World of Warcraft or Fortnite or Apex or Valorant or whatever else you kids

57
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,840
play nowadays.

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,960
This is a game that is meant to be played on your own, summons and invasions notwithstanding

59
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,280
and once you've finished it you put it down and move on to the next game.

60
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,520
Not because it was bad but because it's over and it goes back on your shelf until you feel

61
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,700
like playing it again.

62
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,400
And yet game journos are treating Elden Ring as if it's a failure for not being able

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,080
to maintain the player base.

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,880
Like it's an RPG you're not meant to play it forever.

65
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,000
This was back in the day when I was a kid heading off to Blockbuster or whatever to

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,360
rent a video game for the weekend.

67
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,740
Imagine this scenario.

68
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,960
Some of the best gaming experiences of my life.

69
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,440
Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time, Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,240
Battle 64, Secret of Mana.

71
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,160
These were the games that I first encountered by renting them several years after they had

72
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
released.

73
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,280
These weren't new games when they were new to me.

74
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,040
Whenever I talked to the other kids on the playground about them they had a lot to say

75
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,960
about them because to them they were old.

76
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,600
But they were still accepted by all of us as really good experiences.

77
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,240
I had no idea or care how many other kids were playing these games simultaneously while

78
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
I was.

79
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,840
If I could hop online and read an article saying Donkey Kong 64 or Metal Gear Solid

80
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,880
loses 90% of its current player count, massive flop, player decline, etc.

81
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,240
I may not have picked up any of those games.

82
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,320
In fact when I did find a hidden gem like for example Goof Troop on the Super Nintendo

83
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,600
where nobody on the playground knew what the fuck I was talking about it actually felt

84
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,600
better.

85
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,260
Less people were playing it but that made the game my little secret.

86
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,000
It was my private experience that I could choose to show just to my friends and we could

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,020
enjoy it with that added spice of knowing that it was just ours.

88
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,580
But I think post World of Warcraft, maybe even post Diablo, games began to shift to

89
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,460
these always online experiences with no real end point.

90
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,720
There's an expectation right now that every game at least try to be a forever game, meaning

91
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,560
that it's a game that you don't stop playing.

92
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,560
It keeps getting updated.

93
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,540
There's always new content, new expansions, or DLC or patches, there's loot boxes or

94
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,920
season passes or skin stores or whatever.

95
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,100
And the game is set up such that it's not a narrative experience that ends when you

96
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,360
finish the story but it's a potentially infinite set of endlessly regeneratable experiences

97
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,120
played online against either the AI or other people.

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,040
Look at how many people play League of Legends.

99
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,000
Now look at how many of those same people played League of Legends 10 years ago.

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,440
The same game for a decade.

101
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,680
Some of them are grinding rankings or trying to go pro.

102
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,460
Some of them just played a little bit after work, the equivalent of watching a bit of

103
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,640
TV at the end of the day.

104
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,720
But I think that this shift towards forever games has become toxic to the gaming industry.

105
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,800
Every game being made right now has to have that online foreverness to it.

106
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,820
Fortnite's online mode is a side mode.

107
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,460
That game actually had a story mode for all the good that it did it.

108
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,700
PUBG, Team Fortress 2, Overwatch, Apex Legends, all of these games are designed to be games

109
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,540
that you play for the rest of your life where they regularly release new maps or heroes

110
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,540
or whatever to keep you interested.

111
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,300
But at the end of the day, you're just playing online against other people.

112
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,300
That's fine.

113
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,520
There's absolutely a place for those kinds of games.

114
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,640
But how many games have been designed to be the most blatant cash grabs and then just

115
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,660
collapsed and failed because they wanted to be the next Fortnite?

116
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,380
When it comes to online games, nobody wants to be playing a dead game.

117
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,620
Naomi is going through this right now with Overwatch.

118
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,620
She loves that game.

119
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,540
There's a little bit of a trash fire that Overwatch 2 is looking like.

120
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,660
She's not going to be getting that one.

121
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,300
So she's been playing Overwatch and watching it slowly wither away.

122
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,500
And it's actually been a pretty sad experience for her because when we're not doing a stream

123
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,660
or something else and she's got a little bit of downtime, she likes to play some Overwatch.

124
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,300
And your accomplishments feel more meaningful in a game like that.

125
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,740
If there's a thriving community in Overwatch, if you've got golden guns or if in World

126
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,500
of Warcraft, you got a rare drop mount or a legendary weapon or in TF2, if you have

127
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,140
a rare hat or something like that.

128
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,580
These in-game accomplishments in an online game feel meaningful only if other players

129
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,580
can see them.

130
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,780
If it's a dead game, then who cares about the accomplishments?

131
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,500
In an offline game, it's a different story.

132
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,340
For example, I've got a save file on my old PlayStation 1 memory card, where I actually

133
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,820
managed to get Excalibur 2 in Final Fantasy 9.

134
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,500
If you don't know what that means, it's legitimately quite a feat, but I did that

135
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
for me.

136
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
What am I going to do with it?

137
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,100
Next time I have a girl over and I want to impress her, I'm going to boot up my old

138
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,940
scratch to shit copy of FF9 and show her Excalibur 2?

139
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,100
Yeah, that'll get me laid.

140
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,140
No, I did it for me.

141
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
I did it for the accomplishment.

142
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,000
And in a single player experience, it feels like an accomplishment that I can look back

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
on with fond memories.

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,360
But in a multiplayer game, maybe because the purpose of it is to be presented to others,

145
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
I don't know.

146
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,200
I don't look back on my experiences in the same way.

147
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,520
I mean, I still talk to some of those old World of Warcraft people that I used to know

148
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
from back then.

149
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,040
A couple of them are actually viewers of this channel now, which is quite nice.

150
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,560
The friendships remained, and so the fun times with those people in-game have become good

151
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
memories.

152
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,960
But considering the current state of World of Warcraft, it's not like we can go back

153
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,060
to it now and enjoy those old accomplishments anymore.

154
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,060
Not really.

155
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,040
If you have Ashes of Alar or Invincible in Warcraft, other players are still around to

156
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,520
care about that, at least to an extent.

157
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,840
But if you had some cool thing in WildStar, or heaven forbid, Tabula Rasa, nobody cares

158
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
anymore because the servers are gone.

159
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,580
Fun fact, even though Tabula Rasa's server shut down in I think 2009, you could still

160
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,040
buy it from Walmart in 2015.

161
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,920
I pity the poor kid who grabbed that off the shelf on a whim.

162
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Hold on, future dev here recording this while editing.

163
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,260
Walmart still sells Tabula Rasa online.

164
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,800
This game has been dead for 13 years.

165
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,880
What the fuck are you doing, Walmart?

166
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,600
And then there's the absolutely braindead idea to try to make offline games forever

167
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
games.

168
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,440
The most notable example of this recently was Fallout 4, where your settlements kept

169
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,100
getting attacked by the same raiders you just cleared out over and over again, and you kept

170
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,720
getting the same quest to defend them.

171
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,640
The game was designed to be an open world RPG with procedurally generated content that

172
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,880
wouldn't stop, so you could just keep playing it forever.

173
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,400
But the only thing that that did was make the game get so annoying people just shut

174
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
it off.

175
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,880
Probably the worst case scenario is when a non-forever game, a single player experience,

176
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,560
loses something because online support is pulled from it.

177
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,680
There are a few minor examples that affected me.

178
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,840
The Nintendo DS and 3DS Pokemon games, for example, had some primitive online modes with

179
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,200
unique content that is no longer accessible because those servers have been shut down.

180
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,720
Same with some games in the Wii and Wii U.

181
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,140
Those games are still playable, they just feel a little bit empty in a few spots.

182
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,920
Where there was once a fun side thing, there's only a can't connect message.

183
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,480
A more serious version of the same thing is when Ubisoft announced they're pulling the

184
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,040
plug on the online modes for 15 of their older games, including Far Cry 3, Prince of Persia

185
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,600
Forgotten Sands, and at least 5 of the older Assassin's Creed games.

186
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Any online multiplayer for those games is now gone, and in some cases access to DLC

187
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
is gone as well.

188
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,520
For some of them, to be able to even play the single player story mode, you have to

189
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,720
disconnect from the internet.

190
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,200
And for others, you won't even be able to play it at all.

191
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,360
That's the worst case scenario.

192
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,140
To lose access to the single player game you've legally purchased because a company has decided

193
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,520
to turn off a server somewhere else on the planet.

194
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,520
All of these cloud versions of games, from the Google Stadia to Amazon Luna to the cloud

195
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,580
versions on Switch, these will all go bye-bye one day.

196
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,160
The watch battery in my Link to the Past cartridge that I got when I was, like, a fucking fetus,

197
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
that's still ticking.

198
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,740
I can plug that into my SNES anytime.

199
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,700
But these online games, they're vanishing.

200
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,120
And while this state of affairs is entirely unacceptable, and is what makes piracy morally

201
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,680
justified, I can see the other side of the conversation when it comes to forever games.

202
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,160
If a developer puts out a forever game with promises for content down the road, but the

203
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,980
player base just isn't there, that content isn't coming out.

204
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,980
At that point, the game enters a death spiral.

205
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,920
Who wants to play an online game nobody else is playing, and isn't going to get updated

206
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
because the revenue isn't there?

207
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,500
In that case, I understand the obsession over player counts by the game journos.

208
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,580
It's actually a useful bit of consumer information.

209
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,100
Beyond that, though, it just seems to be an easy way to dunk on games that the journos

210
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,100
don't like.

211
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,260
There's a reason they chose Elden Ring for this, you know?

212
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,400
I'm going to guess it's because all those same journos were whining that the game was

213
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,620
too hard, and it needed to have a baby mode in the name of accessibility.

214
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,940
Now, I'm also guilty of this to an extent.

215
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,820
In a previous video, for example, I had a good ol' laugh at the player count of zero

216
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,540
for several years out of that commie game Tonight We Riot.

217
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,220
That's because the player count was zero, that's a bit of an outlier.

218
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,760
That's not, oh people have moved on to the next game, that's nobody ever played this

219
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
turd ever.

220
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,580
So the takeaway is, if a new online game launches and player count rapidly drops, that actually

221
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,800
tells us a story.

222
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,500
Maybe the game's too unreliable for people to be able to actually log on, maybe the game's

223
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,740
glitchy, maybe the game isn't good, or maybe the game's late-stage content isn't really

224
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,140
all that developed yet.

225
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,460
But if a new offline game launches, then it could just mean that people beat the game

226
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,100
and they're putting it down to play something else, and that's perfectly fine.

227
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,980
I think it's ultimately destructive to the video games industry, this desire of developers

228
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,680
to build a game that will be played in perpetuity to the detriment of both their company and

229
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,240
their users, or this desire of players to avoid feeling left out and alone to the point

230
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,340
that they're searching for a game that they're constantly connected to, that when they post

231
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,340
about it on social media, everyone knows what they're talking about, and they feel like

232
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,060
they're connected to other people.

233
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,180
This generation of a feeling of unending connection to other, wait, wait a second, this is going

234
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,060
to end in Marx's On the Jewish Question, isn't it?

235
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,260
Even in a fucking gaming video, I can't get away from it.
