00:00.000 --> 00:15.120
I have a vague recollection of having done this topic before on the channel.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.900
I think I did a video on it like 5 years ago, I don't know.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.760
That might actually be one of the rare lost SFOs.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.820
I'll have to go shake Dave's tree to see where that one ended up.

00:22.820 --> 00:25.820
But it's worth retreading anyway because things have gotten far worse since the last time

00:25.820 --> 00:26.820
we talked about it.

00:26.820 --> 00:30.600
There's this dumb trend in gaming right now to judge a video game solely by its concurrent

00:30.600 --> 00:31.600
player counts.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.120
If it sees a massive drop off of players then the game is dead.

00:34.120 --> 00:37.560
In fact, if you were to take the Game Journal's opinion on it, every game is dead.

00:37.560 --> 00:38.560
All of them.

00:38.560 --> 00:39.560
All the time.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.440
Lost Ark peak players down more than 80% from all time high.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.520
Anthem's player count paints a very grim picture.

00:44.520 --> 00:47.040
The Division's player count has dropped 93% since launch.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.560
War Honor has now lost 95% of its player base.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.440
Realm Royale lost more than a year ago.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.440
New World has lost more than a year ago.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.440
Star Wars Battlefront's player count is lower.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.900
Games media has this obsession with how many people are playing a game.

00:59.900 --> 01:01.060
And I get it, you know?

01:01.060 --> 01:04.520
I remember being in school playing the original World of Warcraft and a good chunk of why

01:04.520 --> 01:07.320
that game was so fun was because it was a lively game.

01:07.320 --> 01:08.740
It felt like a lived in world.

01:08.740 --> 01:12.220
When you walked into Orgrimmar for the first time and saw all the other players going about

01:12.220 --> 01:16.620
their business and you were this level 5 noob trying to get your first trainer quest done

01:16.620 --> 01:21.200
and this level 60 in epic armor rode by on a mount, it felt like you were a single player

01:21.200 --> 01:24.460
in a world with a bunch of moving interlocking pieces.

01:24.460 --> 01:28.420
World of Warcraft was extremely well designed for its time but what gave the game its magic

01:28.420 --> 01:32.420
was how popular it was and how that popularity influenced the player experience.

01:32.420 --> 01:37.380
In an alternate universe where World of Warcraft never got big even if it was exactly the same

01:37.380 --> 01:38.860
game, it would have been a lot less fun.

01:38.860 --> 01:41.900
In fact, anybody who played on a dead server can attest to that.

01:41.900 --> 01:45.740
Walking around any city on a server with no players feels like walking around a ghost

01:45.740 --> 01:46.740
town.

01:46.740 --> 01:50.540
Sure there are NPCs wandering around but without that human element everything just looks automated

01:50.540 --> 01:51.540
and lifeless.

01:51.540 --> 01:55.080
I think it's for this reason every time Blizzard announced a new server back in the day there

01:55.080 --> 01:59.960
was a massive rush of people eager to experience being on the edge of the server's level ups

01:59.960 --> 02:00.960
once again.

02:00.960 --> 02:04.520
Even on a populated server if most people playing there were max level the low level

02:04.520 --> 02:06.420
areas still felt like ghost towns.

02:06.420 --> 02:10.980
The point I'm getting at is World of Warcraft's quality came from, at least in part, something

02:10.980 --> 02:12.760
outside of the game's design.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.880
It came from the experience of playing it with other people and so when game journos

02:16.880 --> 02:21.320
publish article after article on how a game is losing players there's a subtext here.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.960
Don't play this game because it's trash.

02:22.960 --> 02:23.960
How do you know it's trash?

02:23.960 --> 02:25.220
Because nobody else is playing it.

02:25.220 --> 02:27.740
There's a huge problem with this logic though isn't there?

02:27.740 --> 02:31.840
Like for example when they did this to Elden Ring it was considered a gigantic fucking

02:31.840 --> 02:32.840
joke.

02:32.840 --> 02:37.540
Elden Ring is the best game of 2022 and yet we still saw yahoos publish shit decrying

02:37.540 --> 02:41.000
the game for losing 90% of its concurrent players on steam.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.720
Well yeah you dolt it's a single player experience.

02:43.720 --> 02:47.740
This isn't World of Warcraft or Fortnite or Apex or Valorant or whatever else you kids

02:47.740 --> 02:48.840
play nowadays.

02:48.840 --> 02:52.960
This is a game that is meant to be played on your own, summons and invasions notwithstanding

02:52.960 --> 02:56.280
and once you've finished it you put it down and move on to the next game.

02:56.280 --> 03:00.520
Not because it was bad but because it's over and it goes back on your shelf until you feel

03:00.520 --> 03:01.700
like playing it again.

03:01.700 --> 03:05.400
And yet game journos are treating Elden Ring as if it's a failure for not being able

03:05.400 --> 03:07.080
to maintain the player base.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.880
Like it's an RPG you're not meant to play it forever.

03:09.880 --> 03:13.000
This was back in the day when I was a kid heading off to Blockbuster or whatever to

03:13.000 --> 03:14.360
rent a video game for the weekend.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.740
Imagine this scenario.

03:15.740 --> 03:17.960
Some of the best gaming experiences of my life.

03:17.960 --> 03:21.440
Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time, Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre

03:21.440 --> 03:23.240
Battle 64, Secret of Mana.

03:23.240 --> 03:27.160
These were the games that I first encountered by renting them several years after they had

03:27.160 --> 03:28.160
released.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.280
These weren't new games when they were new to me.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.040
Whenever I talked to the other kids on the playground about them they had a lot to say

03:33.040 --> 03:34.960
about them because to them they were old.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.600
But they were still accepted by all of us as really good experiences.

03:37.600 --> 03:42.240
I had no idea or care how many other kids were playing these games simultaneously while

03:42.240 --> 03:43.240
I was.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.840
If I could hop online and read an article saying Donkey Kong 64 or Metal Gear Solid

03:46.840 --> 03:50.880
loses 90% of its current player count, massive flop, player decline, etc.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.240
I may not have picked up any of those games.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.320
In fact when I did find a hidden gem like for example Goof Troop on the Super Nintendo

03:57.320 --> 04:00.600
where nobody on the playground knew what the fuck I was talking about it actually felt

04:00.600 --> 04:01.600
better.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.260
Less people were playing it but that made the game my little secret.

04:04.260 --> 04:08.000
It was my private experience that I could choose to show just to my friends and we could

04:08.000 --> 04:11.020
enjoy it with that added spice of knowing that it was just ours.

04:11.020 --> 04:15.580
But I think post World of Warcraft, maybe even post Diablo, games began to shift to

04:15.580 --> 04:18.460
these always online experiences with no real end point.

04:18.460 --> 04:22.720
There's an expectation right now that every game at least try to be a forever game, meaning

04:22.720 --> 04:24.560
that it's a game that you don't stop playing.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.560
It keeps getting updated.

04:25.560 --> 04:29.540
There's always new content, new expansions, or DLC or patches, there's loot boxes or

04:29.540 --> 04:31.920
season passes or skin stores or whatever.

04:31.920 --> 04:35.100
And the game is set up such that it's not a narrative experience that ends when you

04:35.100 --> 04:39.360
finish the story but it's a potentially infinite set of endlessly regeneratable experiences

04:39.360 --> 04:42.120
played online against either the AI or other people.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.040
Look at how many people play League of Legends.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.000
Now look at how many of those same people played League of Legends 10 years ago.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.440
The same game for a decade.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.680
Some of them are grinding rankings or trying to go pro.

04:51.680 --> 04:54.460
Some of them just played a little bit after work, the equivalent of watching a bit of

04:54.460 --> 04:55.640
TV at the end of the day.

04:55.640 --> 05:00.720
But I think that this shift towards forever games has become toxic to the gaming industry.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.800
Every game being made right now has to have that online foreverness to it.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.820
Fortnite's online mode is a side mode.

05:06.820 --> 05:09.460
That game actually had a story mode for all the good that it did it.

05:09.460 --> 05:13.700
PUBG, Team Fortress 2, Overwatch, Apex Legends, all of these games are designed to be games

05:13.700 --> 05:17.540
that you play for the rest of your life where they regularly release new maps or heroes

05:17.540 --> 05:18.540
or whatever to keep you interested.

05:18.540 --> 05:21.300
But at the end of the day, you're just playing online against other people.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.300
That's fine.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.520
There's absolutely a place for those kinds of games.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.640
But how many games have been designed to be the most blatant cash grabs and then just

05:27.640 --> 05:30.660
collapsed and failed because they wanted to be the next Fortnite?

05:30.660 --> 05:33.380
When it comes to online games, nobody wants to be playing a dead game.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.620
Naomi is going through this right now with Overwatch.

05:35.620 --> 05:36.620
She loves that game.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.540
There's a little bit of a trash fire that Overwatch 2 is looking like.

05:38.540 --> 05:39.660
She's not going to be getting that one.

05:39.660 --> 05:42.300
So she's been playing Overwatch and watching it slowly wither away.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.500
And it's actually been a pretty sad experience for her because when we're not doing a stream

05:45.500 --> 05:48.660
or something else and she's got a little bit of downtime, she likes to play some Overwatch.

05:48.660 --> 05:51.300
And your accomplishments feel more meaningful in a game like that.

05:51.300 --> 05:54.740
If there's a thriving community in Overwatch, if you've got golden guns or if in World

05:54.740 --> 05:58.500
of Warcraft, you got a rare drop mount or a legendary weapon or in TF2, if you have

05:58.500 --> 06:00.140
a rare hat or something like that.

06:00.140 --> 06:04.580
These in-game accomplishments in an online game feel meaningful only if other players

06:04.580 --> 06:05.580
can see them.

06:05.580 --> 06:07.780
If it's a dead game, then who cares about the accomplishments?

06:07.780 --> 06:09.500
In an offline game, it's a different story.

06:09.500 --> 06:13.340
For example, I've got a save file on my old PlayStation 1 memory card, where I actually

06:13.340 --> 06:15.820
managed to get Excalibur 2 in Final Fantasy 9.

06:15.820 --> 06:18.500
If you don't know what that means, it's legitimately quite a feat, but I did that

06:18.500 --> 06:19.500
for me.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.500
What am I going to do with it?

06:20.500 --> 06:23.100
Next time I have a girl over and I want to impress her, I'm going to boot up my old

06:23.100 --> 06:25.940
scratch to shit copy of FF9 and show her Excalibur 2?

06:25.940 --> 06:27.100
Yeah, that'll get me laid.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.140
No, I did it for me.

06:28.140 --> 06:29.140
I did it for the accomplishment.

06:29.140 --> 06:33.000
And in a single player experience, it feels like an accomplishment that I can look back

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
on with fond memories.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.360
But in a multiplayer game, maybe because the purpose of it is to be presented to others,

06:37.360 --> 06:38.360
I don't know.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.200
I don't look back on my experiences in the same way.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.520
I mean, I still talk to some of those old World of Warcraft people that I used to know

06:43.520 --> 06:44.520
from back then.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.040
A couple of them are actually viewers of this channel now, which is quite nice.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.560
The friendships remained, and so the fun times with those people in-game have become good

06:50.560 --> 06:51.560
memories.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.960
But considering the current state of World of Warcraft, it's not like we can go back

06:53.960 --> 06:56.060
to it now and enjoy those old accomplishments anymore.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.060
Not really.

06:57.060 --> 07:00.040
If you have Ashes of Alar or Invincible in Warcraft, other players are still around to

07:00.040 --> 07:01.520
care about that, at least to an extent.

07:01.520 --> 07:05.840
But if you had some cool thing in WildStar, or heaven forbid, Tabula Rasa, nobody cares

07:05.840 --> 07:07.440
anymore because the servers are gone.

07:07.440 --> 07:11.580
Fun fact, even though Tabula Rasa's server shut down in I think 2009, you could still

07:11.580 --> 07:14.040
buy it from Walmart in 2015.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.920
I pity the poor kid who grabbed that off the shelf on a whim.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.920
Hold on, future dev here recording this while editing.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.260
Walmart still sells Tabula Rasa online.

07:23.260 --> 07:26.800
This game has been dead for 13 years.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.880
What the fuck are you doing, Walmart?

07:28.880 --> 07:33.600
And then there's the absolutely braindead idea to try to make offline games forever

07:33.600 --> 07:34.600
games.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.440
The most notable example of this recently was Fallout 4, where your settlements kept

07:37.440 --> 07:41.100
getting attacked by the same raiders you just cleared out over and over again, and you kept

07:41.100 --> 07:42.720
getting the same quest to defend them.

07:42.720 --> 07:46.640
The game was designed to be an open world RPG with procedurally generated content that

07:46.640 --> 07:48.880
wouldn't stop, so you could just keep playing it forever.

07:48.880 --> 07:52.400
But the only thing that that did was make the game get so annoying people just shut

07:52.400 --> 07:53.400
it off.

07:53.400 --> 07:57.880
Probably the worst case scenario is when a non-forever game, a single player experience,

07:57.880 --> 08:00.560
loses something because online support is pulled from it.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.680
There are a few minor examples that affected me.

08:02.680 --> 08:06.840
The Nintendo DS and 3DS Pokemon games, for example, had some primitive online modes with

08:06.840 --> 08:10.200
unique content that is no longer accessible because those servers have been shut down.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.720
Same with some games in the Wii and Wii U.

08:11.720 --> 08:15.140
Those games are still playable, they just feel a little bit empty in a few spots.

08:15.140 --> 08:18.920
Where there was once a fun side thing, there's only a can't connect message.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.480
A more serious version of the same thing is when Ubisoft announced they're pulling the

08:22.480 --> 08:27.040
plug on the online modes for 15 of their older games, including Far Cry 3, Prince of Persia

08:27.040 --> 08:30.600
Forgotten Sands, and at least 5 of the older Assassin's Creed games.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.600
Any online multiplayer for those games is now gone, and in some cases access to DLC

08:34.600 --> 08:35.600
is gone as well.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.520
For some of them, to be able to even play the single player story mode, you have to

08:38.520 --> 08:39.720
disconnect from the internet.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.200
And for others, you won't even be able to play it at all.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.360
That's the worst case scenario.

08:43.360 --> 08:48.140
To lose access to the single player game you've legally purchased because a company has decided

08:48.140 --> 08:50.520
to turn off a server somewhere else on the planet.

08:50.520 --> 08:54.520
All of these cloud versions of games, from the Google Stadia to Amazon Luna to the cloud

08:54.520 --> 08:57.580
versions on Switch, these will all go bye-bye one day.

08:57.580 --> 09:02.160
The watch battery in my Link to the Past cartridge that I got when I was, like, a fucking fetus,

09:02.160 --> 09:03.160
that's still ticking.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.740
I can plug that into my SNES anytime.

09:04.740 --> 09:06.700
But these online games, they're vanishing.

09:06.700 --> 09:11.120
And while this state of affairs is entirely unacceptable, and is what makes piracy morally

09:11.120 --> 09:14.680
justified, I can see the other side of the conversation when it comes to forever games.

09:14.680 --> 09:18.160
If a developer puts out a forever game with promises for content down the road, but the

09:18.160 --> 09:20.980
player base just isn't there, that content isn't coming out.

09:20.980 --> 09:22.980
At that point, the game enters a death spiral.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.920
Who wants to play an online game nobody else is playing, and isn't going to get updated

09:25.920 --> 09:27.200
because the revenue isn't there?

09:27.200 --> 09:30.500
In that case, I understand the obsession over player counts by the game journos.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.580
It's actually a useful bit of consumer information.

09:32.580 --> 09:36.100
Beyond that, though, it just seems to be an easy way to dunk on games that the journos

09:36.100 --> 09:37.100
don't like.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.260
There's a reason they chose Elden Ring for this, you know?

09:39.260 --> 09:42.400
I'm going to guess it's because all those same journos were whining that the game was

09:42.400 --> 09:45.620
too hard, and it needed to have a baby mode in the name of accessibility.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.940
Now, I'm also guilty of this to an extent.

09:47.940 --> 09:51.820
In a previous video, for example, I had a good ol' laugh at the player count of zero

09:51.820 --> 09:54.540
for several years out of that commie game Tonight We Riot.

09:54.540 --> 09:57.220
That's because the player count was zero, that's a bit of an outlier.

09:57.220 --> 10:00.760
That's not, oh people have moved on to the next game, that's nobody ever played this

10:00.760 --> 10:01.760
turd ever.

10:01.760 --> 10:06.580
So the takeaway is, if a new online game launches and player count rapidly drops, that actually

10:06.580 --> 10:07.800
tells us a story.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.500
Maybe the game's too unreliable for people to be able to actually log on, maybe the game's

10:11.500 --> 10:15.740
glitchy, maybe the game isn't good, or maybe the game's late-stage content isn't really

10:15.740 --> 10:17.140
all that developed yet.

10:17.140 --> 10:21.460
But if a new offline game launches, then it could just mean that people beat the game

10:21.460 --> 10:24.100
and they're putting it down to play something else, and that's perfectly fine.

10:24.100 --> 10:27.980
I think it's ultimately destructive to the video games industry, this desire of developers

10:27.980 --> 10:31.680
to build a game that will be played in perpetuity to the detriment of both their company and

10:31.680 --> 10:36.240
their users, or this desire of players to avoid feeling left out and alone to the point

10:36.240 --> 10:39.340
that they're searching for a game that they're constantly connected to, that when they post

10:39.340 --> 10:42.340
about it on social media, everyone knows what they're talking about, and they feel like

10:42.340 --> 10:44.060
they're connected to other people.

10:44.060 --> 10:48.180
This generation of a feeling of unending connection to other, wait, wait a second, this is going

10:48.180 --> 10:51.060
to end in Marx's On the Jewish Question, isn't it?

10:51.060 --> 10:53.260
Even in a fucking gaming video, I can't get away from it.
