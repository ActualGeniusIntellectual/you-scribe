0	15120	I have a vague recollection of having done this topic before on the channel.
15120	17900	I think I did a video on it like 5 years ago, I don't know.
17900	19760	That might actually be one of the rare lost SFOs.
19760	22820	I'll have to go shake Dave's tree to see where that one ended up.
22820	25820	But it's worth retreading anyway because things have gotten far worse since the last time
25820	26820	we talked about it.
26820	30600	There's this dumb trend in gaming right now to judge a video game solely by its concurrent
30600	31600	player counts.
31600	34120	If it sees a massive drop off of players then the game is dead.
34120	37560	In fact, if you were to take the Game Journal's opinion on it, every game is dead.
37560	38560	All of them.
38560	39560	All the time.
39560	42440	Lost Ark peak players down more than 80% from all time high.
42440	44520	Anthem's player count paints a very grim picture.
44520	47040	The Division's player count has dropped 93% since launch.
47040	49560	War Honor has now lost 95% of its player base.
49560	51440	Realm Royale lost more than a year ago.
51440	52440	New World has lost more than a year ago.
52440	54440	Star Wars Battlefront's player count is lower.
54440	59900	Games media has this obsession with how many people are playing a game.
59900	61060	And I get it, you know?
61060	64520	I remember being in school playing the original World of Warcraft and a good chunk of why
64520	67320	that game was so fun was because it was a lively game.
67320	68740	It felt like a lived in world.
68740	72220	When you walked into Orgrimmar for the first time and saw all the other players going about
72220	76620	their business and you were this level 5 noob trying to get your first trainer quest done
76620	81200	and this level 60 in epic armor rode by on a mount, it felt like you were a single player
81200	84460	in a world with a bunch of moving interlocking pieces.
84460	88420	World of Warcraft was extremely well designed for its time but what gave the game its magic
88420	92420	was how popular it was and how that popularity influenced the player experience.
92420	97380	In an alternate universe where World of Warcraft never got big even if it was exactly the same
97380	98860	game, it would have been a lot less fun.
98860	101900	In fact, anybody who played on a dead server can attest to that.
101900	105740	Walking around any city on a server with no players feels like walking around a ghost
105740	106740	town.
106740	110540	Sure there are NPCs wandering around but without that human element everything just looks automated
110540	111540	and lifeless.
111540	115080	I think it's for this reason every time Blizzard announced a new server back in the day there
115080	119960	was a massive rush of people eager to experience being on the edge of the server's level ups
119960	120960	once again.
120960	124520	Even on a populated server if most people playing there were max level the low level
124520	126420	areas still felt like ghost towns.
126420	130980	The point I'm getting at is World of Warcraft's quality came from, at least in part, something
130980	132760	outside of the game's design.
132760	136880	It came from the experience of playing it with other people and so when game journos
136880	141320	publish article after article on how a game is losing players there's a subtext here.
141320	142960	Don't play this game because it's trash.
142960	143960	How do you know it's trash?
143960	145220	Because nobody else is playing it.
145220	147740	There's a huge problem with this logic though isn't there?
147740	151840	Like for example when they did this to Elden Ring it was considered a gigantic fucking
151840	152840	joke.
152840	157540	Elden Ring is the best game of 2022 and yet we still saw yahoos publish shit decrying
157540	161000	the game for losing 90% of its concurrent players on steam.
161000	163720	Well yeah you dolt it's a single player experience.
163720	167740	This isn't World of Warcraft or Fortnite or Apex or Valorant or whatever else you kids
167740	168840	play nowadays.
168840	172960	This is a game that is meant to be played on your own, summons and invasions notwithstanding
172960	176280	and once you've finished it you put it down and move on to the next game.
176280	180520	Not because it was bad but because it's over and it goes back on your shelf until you feel
180520	181700	like playing it again.
181700	185400	And yet game journos are treating Elden Ring as if it's a failure for not being able
185400	187080	to maintain the player base.
187080	189880	Like it's an RPG you're not meant to play it forever.
189880	193000	This was back in the day when I was a kid heading off to Blockbuster or whatever to
193000	194360	rent a video game for the weekend.
194360	195740	Imagine this scenario.
195740	197960	Some of the best gaming experiences of my life.
197960	201440	Chrono Trigger, Earthbound, Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time, Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre
201440	203240	Battle 64, Secret of Mana.
203240	207160	These were the games that I first encountered by renting them several years after they had
207160	208160	released.
208160	210280	These weren't new games when they were new to me.
210280	213040	Whenever I talked to the other kids on the playground about them they had a lot to say
213040	214960	about them because to them they were old.
214960	217600	But they were still accepted by all of us as really good experiences.
217600	222240	I had no idea or care how many other kids were playing these games simultaneously while
222240	223240	I was.
223240	226840	If I could hop online and read an article saying Donkey Kong 64 or Metal Gear Solid
226840	230880	loses 90% of its current player count, massive flop, player decline, etc.
230880	233240	I may not have picked up any of those games.
233240	237320	In fact when I did find a hidden gem like for example Goof Troop on the Super Nintendo
237320	240600	where nobody on the playground knew what the fuck I was talking about it actually felt
240600	241600	better.
241600	244260	Less people were playing it but that made the game my little secret.
244260	248000	It was my private experience that I could choose to show just to my friends and we could
248000	251020	enjoy it with that added spice of knowing that it was just ours.
251020	255580	But I think post World of Warcraft, maybe even post Diablo, games began to shift to
255580	258460	these always online experiences with no real end point.
258460	262720	There's an expectation right now that every game at least try to be a forever game, meaning
262720	264560	that it's a game that you don't stop playing.
264560	265560	It keeps getting updated.
265560	269540	There's always new content, new expansions, or DLC or patches, there's loot boxes or
269540	271920	season passes or skin stores or whatever.
271920	275100	And the game is set up such that it's not a narrative experience that ends when you
275100	279360	finish the story but it's a potentially infinite set of endlessly regeneratable experiences
279360	282120	played online against either the AI or other people.
282120	284040	Look at how many people play League of Legends.
284040	288000	Now look at how many of those same people played League of Legends 10 years ago.
288000	289440	The same game for a decade.
289440	291680	Some of them are grinding rankings or trying to go pro.
291680	294460	Some of them just played a little bit after work, the equivalent of watching a bit of
294460	295640	TV at the end of the day.
295640	300720	But I think that this shift towards forever games has become toxic to the gaming industry.
300720	304800	Every game being made right now has to have that online foreverness to it.
304800	306820	Fortnite's online mode is a side mode.
306820	309460	That game actually had a story mode for all the good that it did it.
309460	313700	PUBG, Team Fortress 2, Overwatch, Apex Legends, all of these games are designed to be games
313700	317540	that you play for the rest of your life where they regularly release new maps or heroes
317540	318540	or whatever to keep you interested.
318540	321300	But at the end of the day, you're just playing online against other people.
321300	322300	That's fine.
322300	323520	There's absolutely a place for those kinds of games.
323520	327640	But how many games have been designed to be the most blatant cash grabs and then just
327640	330660	collapsed and failed because they wanted to be the next Fortnite?
330660	333380	When it comes to online games, nobody wants to be playing a dead game.
333380	335620	Naomi is going through this right now with Overwatch.
335620	336620	She loves that game.
337420	338540	There's a little bit of a trash fire that Overwatch 2 is looking like.
338540	339660	She's not going to be getting that one.
339660	342300	So she's been playing Overwatch and watching it slowly wither away.
342300	345500	And it's actually been a pretty sad experience for her because when we're not doing a stream
345500	348660	or something else and she's got a little bit of downtime, she likes to play some Overwatch.
348660	351300	And your accomplishments feel more meaningful in a game like that.
351300	354740	If there's a thriving community in Overwatch, if you've got golden guns or if in World
354740	358500	of Warcraft, you got a rare drop mount or a legendary weapon or in TF2, if you have
358500	360140	a rare hat or something like that.
360140	364580	These in-game accomplishments in an online game feel meaningful only if other players
364580	365580	can see them.
365580	367780	If it's a dead game, then who cares about the accomplishments?
367780	369500	In an offline game, it's a different story.
369500	373340	For example, I've got a save file on my old PlayStation 1 memory card, where I actually
373340	375820	managed to get Excalibur 2 in Final Fantasy 9.
375820	378500	If you don't know what that means, it's legitimately quite a feat, but I did that
378500	379500	for me.
379500	380500	What am I going to do with it?
380500	383100	Next time I have a girl over and I want to impress her, I'm going to boot up my old
383100	385940	scratch to shit copy of FF9 and show her Excalibur 2?
385940	387100	Yeah, that'll get me laid.
387100	388140	No, I did it for me.
388140	389140	I did it for the accomplishment.
389140	393000	And in a single player experience, it feels like an accomplishment that I can look back
393000	394000	on with fond memories.
394000	397360	But in a multiplayer game, maybe because the purpose of it is to be presented to others,
397360	398360	I don't know.
398360	400200	I don't look back on my experiences in the same way.
400200	403520	I mean, I still talk to some of those old World of Warcraft people that I used to know
403520	404520	from back then.
404520	407040	A couple of them are actually viewers of this channel now, which is quite nice.
407040	410560	The friendships remained, and so the fun times with those people in-game have become good
410560	411560	memories.
411560	413960	But considering the current state of World of Warcraft, it's not like we can go back
413960	416060	to it now and enjoy those old accomplishments anymore.
416060	417060	Not really.
417060	420040	If you have Ashes of Alar or Invincible in Warcraft, other players are still around to
420040	421520	care about that, at least to an extent.
421520	425840	But if you had some cool thing in WildStar, or heaven forbid, Tabula Rasa, nobody cares
425840	427440	anymore because the servers are gone.
427440	431580	Fun fact, even though Tabula Rasa's server shut down in I think 2009, you could still
431580	434040	buy it from Walmart in 2015.
434040	436920	I pity the poor kid who grabbed that off the shelf on a whim.
436920	439920	Hold on, future dev here recording this while editing.
439920	443260	Walmart still sells Tabula Rasa online.
443260	446800	This game has been dead for 13 years.
446800	448880	What the fuck are you doing, Walmart?
448880	453600	And then there's the absolutely braindead idea to try to make offline games forever
453600	454600	games.
454600	457440	The most notable example of this recently was Fallout 4, where your settlements kept
457440	461100	getting attacked by the same raiders you just cleared out over and over again, and you kept
461100	462720	getting the same quest to defend them.
462720	466640	The game was designed to be an open world RPG with procedurally generated content that
466640	468880	wouldn't stop, so you could just keep playing it forever.
468880	472400	But the only thing that that did was make the game get so annoying people just shut
472400	473400	it off.
473400	477880	Probably the worst case scenario is when a non-forever game, a single player experience,
477880	480560	loses something because online support is pulled from it.
480560	482680	There are a few minor examples that affected me.
482680	486840	The Nintendo DS and 3DS Pokemon games, for example, had some primitive online modes with
486840	490200	unique content that is no longer accessible because those servers have been shut down.
490200	491720	Same with some games in the Wii and Wii U.
491720	495140	Those games are still playable, they just feel a little bit empty in a few spots.
495140	498920	Where there was once a fun side thing, there's only a can't connect message.
498920	502480	A more serious version of the same thing is when Ubisoft announced they're pulling the
502480	507040	plug on the online modes for 15 of their older games, including Far Cry 3, Prince of Persia
507040	510600	Forgotten Sands, and at least 5 of the older Assassin's Creed games.
510600	514600	Any online multiplayer for those games is now gone, and in some cases access to DLC
514600	515600	is gone as well.
515600	518520	For some of them, to be able to even play the single player story mode, you have to
518520	519720	disconnect from the internet.
519720	522200	And for others, you won't even be able to play it at all.
522200	523360	That's the worst case scenario.
523360	528140	To lose access to the single player game you've legally purchased because a company has decided
528140	530520	to turn off a server somewhere else on the planet.
530520	534520	All of these cloud versions of games, from the Google Stadia to Amazon Luna to the cloud
534520	537580	versions on Switch, these will all go bye-bye one day.
537580	542160	The watch battery in my Link to the Past cartridge that I got when I was, like, a fucking fetus,
542160	543160	that's still ticking.
543160	544740	I can plug that into my SNES anytime.
544740	546700	But these online games, they're vanishing.
546700	551120	And while this state of affairs is entirely unacceptable, and is what makes piracy morally
551120	554680	justified, I can see the other side of the conversation when it comes to forever games.
554680	558160	If a developer puts out a forever game with promises for content down the road, but the
558160	560980	player base just isn't there, that content isn't coming out.
560980	562980	At that point, the game enters a death spiral.
562980	565920	Who wants to play an online game nobody else is playing, and isn't going to get updated
565920	567200	because the revenue isn't there?
567200	570500	In that case, I understand the obsession over player counts by the game journos.
570500	572580	It's actually a useful bit of consumer information.
572580	576100	Beyond that, though, it just seems to be an easy way to dunk on games that the journos
576100	577100	don't like.
577100	579260	There's a reason they chose Elden Ring for this, you know?
579260	582400	I'm going to guess it's because all those same journos were whining that the game was
582400	585620	too hard, and it needed to have a baby mode in the name of accessibility.
585620	587940	Now, I'm also guilty of this to an extent.
587940	591820	In a previous video, for example, I had a good ol' laugh at the player count of zero
591820	594540	for several years out of that commie game Tonight We Riot.
594540	597220	That's because the player count was zero, that's a bit of an outlier.
597220	600760	That's not, oh people have moved on to the next game, that's nobody ever played this
600760	601760	turd ever.
601760	606580	So the takeaway is, if a new online game launches and player count rapidly drops, that actually
606580	607800	tells us a story.
607800	611500	Maybe the game's too unreliable for people to be able to actually log on, maybe the game's
611500	615740	glitchy, maybe the game isn't good, or maybe the game's late-stage content isn't really
615740	617140	all that developed yet.
617140	621460	But if a new offline game launches, then it could just mean that people beat the game
621460	624100	and they're putting it down to play something else, and that's perfectly fine.
624100	627980	I think it's ultimately destructive to the video games industry, this desire of developers
627980	631680	to build a game that will be played in perpetuity to the detriment of both their company and
631680	636240	their users, or this desire of players to avoid feeling left out and alone to the point
636240	639340	that they're searching for a game that they're constantly connected to, that when they post
639340	642340	about it on social media, everyone knows what they're talking about, and they feel like
642340	644060	they're connected to other people.
644060	648180	This generation of a feeling of unending connection to other, wait, wait a second, this is going
648180	651060	to end in Marx's On the Jewish Question, isn't it?
651060	653260	Even in a fucking gaming video, I can't get away from it.
