1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
I guess I'm now on my dev racism arc, because today we're talking about the smoke detector

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,680
chirp meme.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,260
Have you ever been playing an online game, maybe on PC, more commonly on Xbox, and you're

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,120
talking to people in the game over voice?

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,720
Everything's fine, until you realize that one guy in the call?

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,680
You can hear his smoke alarm going off in the background?

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:33,660
I don't mean like a constant alarm, like he's got a fire going in his house or something.

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,840
I mean like that tiny loud annoying beep every 30 seconds, when the smoke alarm battery is

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,500
running low and it needs to be changed.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Like that.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,500
And it just keeps beeping.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
I don't know man, how the fuck can you not get annoyed with that?

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,840
How can you just sit there and play video games all day while that beep goes off every

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,840
30 seconds?

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
I would fucking lose it.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,760
And yet, there's videos all over the internet right now, of people, yes predominantly black

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,600
people, just ignoring the low battery alarm on their smoke detectors.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,760
I want to give you guys a brief history and basic overview of the Tint of Eve 4 spaceship.

19
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,120
It was used by Leia in the original Star Wars film, on the port side airlock hose.

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,760
Some of them appear to be slightly embarrassed, like for example this one woman, who's reading

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,520
off her old smutty fanfic writing from when she was 16.

22
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:39,440
Some of them appear to not notice at all, like this young rapper getting interviewed

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:55,800
in his house.

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,440
Some of them have done this on national TV, like this American track star who failed a

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:16,000
drug test and is now talking to the news about it.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,920
Apparently this guy recorded his rap song in his house, because the smoke alarm chirp

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,480
made it into the cut.

28
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,160
Here's a black woman being interviewed by a black man and the man asks, how in the hell

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,400
do you live like this?

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,960
And she simply replies, what alarm?

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
I don't hear anything.

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,360
Like red flags?

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,640
That smoke detector that's beeping in the background.

34
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,880
There's a smoke detector.

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,560
It beeps every 30 seconds and it goes beep.

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,240
I don't hear anything beeping.

37
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
Did you just hear it again?

38
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,760
Because I don't hear anything.

39
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Wait for it.

40
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Told you guys, they don't hear it after a while.

41
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
There it was.

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,880
This whole phenomenon came to my attention when Herman Grimm was interviewed for being

43
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,920
given $2 million by New York state as reparations, as compensation for the fact that he failed

44
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,760
the national teacher's examination multiple times.

45
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,760
And they knew I wasn't taking them seriously, because I just wasn't taking them seriously.

46
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,760
You know, why don't you send me letters and tell me about lawsuit, because I know lawsuit

47
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,760
either go through or they won't go through.

48
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,760
You know, but it's when I finally got it in my head, they kept pushing and kept explaining

49
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,760
things piece by piece.

50
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Yes, we're giving money to failures now.

51
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Welcome to 2023.

52
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Their logic is presumably the test was racially biased or some shit when there's no real evidence

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
to the contrary.

54
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,760
But in any case, throughout the entire interview, you can hear the telltale beep.

55
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Of course, this became a meme real quick.

56
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,760
Lots of people making fun of the whole thing, poking fun at themselves.

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:40,760
This is actually a somewhat historical phenomenon.

58
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,760
You guys know about the radio show Love Line?

59
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,760
It started back in 1983.

60
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
People would call in and ask the host for advice about their love life.

61
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,760
As the show went on, the hosts began to notice a correlation between impoverished callers

62
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
and a smoke alarm chirp in the background.

63
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:44,760
You hear that?

64
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,760
She was even surprised the host noticed.

65
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,760
So, what's actually going on here, guys?

66
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Well, a study from 2007 called Waking Effectiveness of Alarm for Adults Who Are Hard of Hearing

67
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,760
showed that your average high-pitched smoke alarm failed to wake 43% of their test participants.

68
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,760
So, it might be the case that some people just can't hear some frequencies.

69
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,760
I've heard the claim online that black people are genetically predisposed to not hear high-pitched

70
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,760
sounds, based on data showing that black people are more likely to die in house fires.

71
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,760
Their logic is, if they can't hear the smoke alarm going off, they're not going to get

72
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
out when there's a fire.

73
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
But that doesn't intuitively sound right to me.

74
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Why the hell would that be a genetic adaptation?

75
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Even if I were to go full race realist mode, it seems to be the case that the ability to

76
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,760
hear animals with higher-pitched sounds is something that would actually be useful if

77
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,760
your ancestors were adapted to living in Africa.

78
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Okay, well, what if people lose their ability to hear higher-pitched sounds over time?

79
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,760
All the people in today's videos are at least in their early 20s.

80
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
And you know what?

81
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
That's actually true.

82
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,760
That's what was at the source of the Lavender Town controversy.

83
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,760
For those of you who don't know, Lavender Town is a location in the first generation

84
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
of Pokemon games.

85
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,760
It's home to the Pokemon Tower, a cemetery where dead Pokemon are put to rest in little

86
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
urns.

87
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
The whole town has a drab color scheme.

88
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,760
The characters who are there are predominantly older people who are rather dour.

89
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,760
The whole place feels like death, like it's haunted or it's creepy.

90
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,760
And the music for the town is also quite creepy, at least as creepy as you can expect from

91
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
a Game Boy game.

92
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Have a listen.

93
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:32,320
Here's the interesting thing, though.

94
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,580
This game came out back in the mid-1990s, and adults who go back and play the game now

95
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,060
have reported that the music in Lavender Town feels off.

96
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,580
Like it doesn't sound like it should, as they remember it sounding.

97
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,800
And this is a widespread phenomenon, it's not just nostalgia goggles kicking in for

98
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,120
one old boomer.

99
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,960
Further investigation of the song actually discovered something very interesting.

100
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,820
The creators of Pokemon wanted Lavender Town to feel creepy, so they used a lot of discordant

101
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,220
notes and high-pitched background hums in the music track.

102
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,260
However, at certain parts of the music, the octave goes so high that teenage and adult

103
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,040
human ears can't actually hear it anymore.

104
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,940
Kids under 12 can, but the human ear commonly loses the ability to hear that frequency over

105
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,160
the course of puberty.

106
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,000
And so, your average adult listening to that part of the track actually can't hear some

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
of the notes.

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,140
However, they can feel it, if that makes sense.

109
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,300
Those people who can't hear the note commonly report mild headaches or blurred vision while

110
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,520
listening to the music, which spawned a whole rumor mill about Japanese kids playing Pokemon

111
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,700
back in the day and then being induced with extreme paranoia or committing suicide, leading

112
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,380
to the music being changed in subsequent releases.

113
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,980
This was all bullshit, but the urban legend persists to this day.

114
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:47,920
By the way, here's the section of the song in question.

115
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,460
If you can't hear the high-pitched whine in the back of the music, congratulations, your

116
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,700
ears are fully developed.

117
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,340
I still can, though, so I guess I really am a manchild.

118
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,560
At this point, I was thinking, maybe the people who can't hear smoke detector chirps.

119
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,000
It's the case that the chirps just so happen to be in that range that people lose the ability

120
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,620
to hear as they get older?

121
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,720
It's kind of a stretch, and also a serious design flaw in smoke detectors, but maybe

122
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
this explains it?

123
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,920
A 2008 study says that, yes, in a more general sense, adults do experience hearing loss as

124
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
they age.

125
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,480
But this actually completely destroyed my original idea, because white people suffer

126
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,100
hearing loss at a much higher rate than black people as they get older.

127
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,580
So yeah, it's not that black people can't hear the chirp.

128
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
They can hear it.

129
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,580
They just fucking ignore it.

130
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,860
In fact, you can even find videos where they explicitly say, yes, I am ignoring it.

131
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,340
Someone's got to change it, and it's not going to be me.

132
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,580
Like, what the fuck, guys?

133
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,500
And then they even complain when you bring it up, like, keep your nose out of my business.

134
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,820
Okay, let's actually get to the bottom of this, once and for all.

135
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,500
Here's another joke TikTok about the whole thing.

136
00:09:47,500 --> 00:10:02,980
I said, motherfucker, what part about, do you not understand?

137
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:10,100
Is it the, or the, because everybody on Xbox live can hear how fucking broke you are through

138
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,100
your headset.

139
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,540
You asked for this.

140
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:18,140
It's been four weeks, three days, 12 hours, and nine minutes.

141
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,300
Get some double A batteries and get the fuck off the couch.

142
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,660
Wait, hey, hey, you son of a bitch, you're going to take, are you taking another battery?

143
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,940
Pretty funny, but it also gives us some insight.

144
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,740
The smoke detector says to the guy, everybody can hear how broke you are.

145
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,380
While some people are lying, are more than willing to chalk this up to race, the predominant

146
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,860
factor seems to be social class, as poor whites do this too.

147
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,780
There's just more poor blacks per capita than poor whites in America.

148
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,460
I can think of a couple of explanations for this behavior.

149
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,520
Some people are actually so fucking poor, they genuinely can't spare the couple of bucks

150
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,620
for a new battery.

151
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,860
Also, some people live in poorer neighborhoods where apartments are crowded together, walls

152
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,900
are thin, and they've simply learned to ignore annoying or intrusive noise to the point that

153
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,620
it's just been filtered out like any other type of white noise.

154
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,180
It's not that they can't hear it, it's that for decades they've categorized it as noise

155
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,020
to ignore rather than noise to deal with.

156
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,260
And like I said in my Portland video a couple days ago, poverty is just as much a mindset

157
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,860
as it is a material condition.

158
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,100
A poor person has developed habits that simply can't be shook out of by giving them a pile

159
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
of money.

160
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,320
A great example is us here.

161
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,220
I remember when this channel first started up, the mindset of all of us was, do everything

162
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,780
as cheap as possible.

163
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,220
We can't spend for a good microphone or whatever because we genuinely believed that whatever

164
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,820
little money we had from our day jobs was going to run out, that tomorrow's paycheck

165
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,580
was simply not guaranteed.

166
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,060
Why spend $200 on a quality starter mic if in a month we'll be destitute?

167
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,780
The poor mentality is the genuine belief that there's a decent chance of whatever money

168
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,820
flow you currently have coming in that's keeping your head just above water will be cut off,

169
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,780
so everything is done in the cheapest possible way.

170
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,900
Everything is slapdash and shoestring.

171
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,960
Long term just, quote, isn't a priority right now.

172
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,180
In fact, you can often tell by the terminology some of these people use that they have this

173
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,180
mindset.

174
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,100
You'll often hear something like, well at least I'm doing something when they're asked

175
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,660
about their bare minimum effort, or they'll say, I'm not going to be able to make it when

176
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,180
they're bailing on a prior commitment.

177
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:11,900
The tone and word choice implies that they feel like the situation is simply out of their

178
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,540
control, that their efforts just aren't good enough, and that they're used to them being

179
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,580
not good enough.

180
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,660
This mentality is often fostered by living in poverty, but getting out of poverty often

181
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,700
doesn't change it.

182
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,140
And yes, this trickles down back to the smoke alarm thing.

183
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,340
A great example of this, by the way, is how Joy Reed, of all fucking people, yes, MSNBC

184
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,780
host and Harvard graduate Joy Reed still can't be fucking arsed to change her batteries on

185
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,780
her smoke detector.

186
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,180
Mr. This is where woke comes to die.

187
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:46,380
Little mini Ron DeSantis, the little tiny governor of Florida, the tiny and I would

188
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:52,820
say probably the most functionally racist governor in America, Ron DeSantis.

189
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,500
Turns out he's super anti-immigration, super anti-woke, but his great great grandmother

190
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:06,820
Luigi Colucci came to the United States, not on the Nina, the Maria or the Santa Maria,

191
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:13,060
as he might have you believe, given his complete devotion to the founders and to the people

192
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:19,660
who colonized this country originally and their absolute and total moral goodness.

193
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,960
But actually, his folks came here in 1917.

194
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,780
So Luigi Colucci, his great great grandmother on his mother's side, came to the United States

195
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:35,940
in February of 1917, a couple of months before the signing of an immigration act, the 1917

196
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,420
Immigration Act, which barred undesirable immigrants.

197
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,380
What were undesirable immigrants back then?

198
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,260
This is why attitudes about debt are very different between poor people and not rich

199
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,040
people, let's say non-poor people.

200
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,140
For a poor person, debt is interest.

201
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,660
You've got to pay more money, which is more problems down the road.

202
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,140
A poor person's advice is never go into debt because they've seen other people go into

203
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,420
debt and get fucked by it.

204
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,960
And you know what, fair enough.

205
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,300
People can get fucked by debt.

206
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,300
It's no joke.

207
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,900
But another way to view debt is as investment.

208
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,740
And this is how I had to think of it.

209
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,020
I had to get out of that.

210
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,860
Why shouldn't I buy a new microphone mindset?

211
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,860
Consider it like this.

212
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,600
Let's say that you want to start up a business, but you don't have the money to buy the equipment

213
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
that you need.

214
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,400
So you get a shitty menial job for a year, you save up the cash, and then you launch

215
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
your business on the side.

216
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
OK, that's great.

217
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
In fact, that's what I did.

218
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,200
But alternatively, you could take out a loan and rather than waiting a year, launch your

219
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
business right now.

220
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,740
Yes, you'll be on the hook for interest, and that sucks.

221
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,520
But if your business is successful, you'll have launched it one year earlier.

222
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,620
Does the extra money that you make by launching one year earlier, one extra year's worth

223
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,520
of profits, outweigh the interest you had to pay in the loan?

224
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,740
Is there an opportunity cost for not launching?

225
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,300
Like if there's a trend you can ride right now to maximize profit that won't exist

226
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,360
one year later?

227
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,700
You can actually math this out.

228
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,080
And in a lot of cases, not going into debt because you're afraid of the interest ends

229
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,160
up costing you money long term.

230
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,060
Now that is a dangerous road to go down.

231
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,920
Lots of people hear that advice and think, so I can just go into debt and that's fine.

232
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
No, no, no.

233
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Debt is a tool.

234
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,960
You need to use it in an intelligent way.

235
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,160
Using debt stupidly is just as dumb as not using it at all.

236
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,200
If you take on debt strategically, you also need to have a solid plan to get out of it.

237
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,760
This is what I mean when I say, and when frankly, a lot of motivational channels also say that

238
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,120
poverty is a mindset.

239
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,480
It's learned helplessness.

240
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,040
You internalize a series of behaviors designed to do the bare minimum because that is genuinely

241
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,160
all that you can do in some cases.

242
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,120
In some cases it isn't, but you just can't see it.

243
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
But in some cases, it genuinely is.

244
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,500
There is a middle ground between buying a new pair of shoes every week because you swim

245
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,700
in money and don't care about waste, and riding your old shoes for a decade so hard that you're

246
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,360
super gluing and stapling them back together constantly, when you're causing so many long

247
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,920
term problems to your health that will cost you way more than any savings you're getting

248
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
right now.

249
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,980
And this is why poor people don't change the batteries on their smoke alarms, causing everybody

250
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,620
the world over to hate them on Xbox Live voice chat and work Zoom meetings and COVID online

251
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,840
and schooling sessions.

252
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,520
Because in their mind, spending one dollar on a new battery is a high price to pay when

253
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,980
you could literally just live with it and keep the dollar.

254
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,500
For some of them, maybe they're so poor that one dollar actually does break the bank.

255
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,600
But I'm willing to bet that for a lot of them, they simply live in the moment, to the point

256
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,900
that they genuinely feel like tomorrow isn't guaranteed, so it's better to keep that dollar

257
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,080
now just in case.

258
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,220
I'm not shitting on this mentality because I've been poor, and I remember when it actually

259
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,080
was the case that next week's paycheck might not be enough to cover that extra one dollar.

260
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,340
But too many people hold on to this mentality even as they get ahead in life, and it poisons

261
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,900
their future success.

262
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:26,140
The smoke detector chirp meme is pretty funny, but it often belies a high time preference

263
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,140
mindset.

264
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,140
Also, it's fucking annoying.

265
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,300
I hate listening to you fucks with a goddamn ceiling bird going off.

266
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,220
I don't care how poor you are, change the fucking battery you broke ass ni-
