0	10400	I guess I'm now on my dev racism arc, because today we're talking about the smoke detector
10400	11680	chirp meme.
11680	16260	Have you ever been playing an online game, maybe on PC, more commonly on Xbox, and you're
16260	18120	talking to people in the game over voice?
18120	20720	Everything's fine, until you realize that one guy in the call?
20720	23680	You can hear his smoke alarm going off in the background?
23680	33660	I don't mean like a constant alarm, like he's got a fire going in his house or something.
33660	38840	I mean like that tiny loud annoying beep every 30 seconds, when the smoke alarm battery is
38840	41500	running low and it needs to be changed.
41500	42500	Like that.
42500	43500	And it just keeps beeping.
43500	45500	I don't know man, how the fuck can you not get annoyed with that?
45500	48840	How can you just sit there and play video games all day while that beep goes off every
48840	49840	30 seconds?
49840	50840	I would fucking lose it.
50840	54760	And yet, there's videos all over the internet right now, of people, yes predominantly black
54760	57600	people, just ignoring the low battery alarm on their smoke detectors.
57600	63760	I want to give you guys a brief history and basic overview of the Tint of Eve 4 spaceship.
63760	69120	It was used by Leia in the original Star Wars film, on the port side airlock hose.
69120	72760	Some of them appear to be slightly embarrassed, like for example this one woman, who's reading
72760	76520	off her old smutty fanfic writing from when she was 16.
76520	99440	Some of them appear to not notice at all, like this young rapper getting interviewed
99440	115800	in his house.
115800	119440	Some of them have done this on national TV, like this American track star who failed a
119440	136000	drug test and is now talking to the news about it.
136000	139920	Apparently this guy recorded his rap song in his house, because the smoke alarm chirp
139920	141480	made it into the cut.
141480	148160	Here's a black woman being interviewed by a black man and the man asks, how in the hell
148160	149400	do you live like this?
149440	150960	And she simply replies, what alarm?
150960	151960	I don't hear anything.
179400	181360	Like red flags?
181360	185640	That smoke detector that's beeping in the background.
185640	188880	There's a smoke detector.
188880	192560	It beeps every 30 seconds and it goes beep.
192560	195240	I don't hear anything beeping.
195240	196240	Did you just hear it again?
196240	198760	Because I don't hear anything.
198760	200760	Wait for it.
200760	208760	Told you guys, they don't hear it after a while.
209760	211760	There it was.
211760	215880	This whole phenomenon came to my attention when Herman Grimm was interviewed for being
215880	220920	given $2 million by New York state as reparations, as compensation for the fact that he failed
220920	223760	the national teacher's examination multiple times.
223760	228760	And they knew I wasn't taking them seriously, because I just wasn't taking them seriously.
228760	234760	You know, why don't you send me letters and tell me about lawsuit, because I know lawsuit
234760	237760	either go through or they won't go through.
238760	244760	You know, but it's when I finally got it in my head, they kept pushing and kept explaining
244760	246760	things piece by piece.
246760	248760	Yes, we're giving money to failures now.
248760	249760	Welcome to 2023.
249760	254760	Their logic is presumably the test was racially biased or some shit when there's no real evidence
254760	255760	to the contrary.
255760	259760	But in any case, throughout the entire interview, you can hear the telltale beep.
259760	261760	Of course, this became a meme real quick.
261760	264760	Lots of people making fun of the whole thing, poking fun at themselves.
264760	280760	This is actually a somewhat historical phenomenon.
280760	282760	You guys know about the radio show Love Line?
282760	284760	It started back in 1983.
284760	286760	People would call in and ask the host for advice about their love life.
286760	291760	As the show went on, the hosts began to notice a correlation between impoverished callers
291760	293760	and a smoke alarm chirp in the background.
321760	344760	You hear that?
344760	347760	She was even surprised the host noticed.
347760	349760	So, what's actually going on here, guys?
349760	354760	Well, a study from 2007 called Waking Effectiveness of Alarm for Adults Who Are Hard of Hearing
354760	360760	showed that your average high-pitched smoke alarm failed to wake 43% of their test participants.
360760	364760	So, it might be the case that some people just can't hear some frequencies.
364760	369760	I've heard the claim online that black people are genetically predisposed to not hear high-pitched
369760	373760	sounds, based on data showing that black people are more likely to die in house fires.
373760	376760	Their logic is, if they can't hear the smoke alarm going off, they're not going to get
376760	377760	out when there's a fire.
377760	379760	But that doesn't intuitively sound right to me.
379760	382760	Why the hell would that be a genetic adaptation?
382760	386760	Even if I were to go full race realist mode, it seems to be the case that the ability to
386760	389760	hear animals with higher-pitched sounds is something that would actually be useful if
389760	392760	your ancestors were adapted to living in Africa.
392760	396760	Okay, well, what if people lose their ability to hear higher-pitched sounds over time?
396760	399760	All the people in today's videos are at least in their early 20s.
399760	400760	And you know what?
400760	401760	That's actually true.
401760	404760	That's what was at the source of the Lavender Town controversy.
404760	407760	For those of you who don't know, Lavender Town is a location in the first generation
407760	408760	of Pokemon games.
408760	412760	It's home to the Pokemon Tower, a cemetery where dead Pokemon are put to rest in little
412760	413760	urns.
413760	414760	The whole town has a drab color scheme.
414760	418760	The characters who are there are predominantly older people who are rather dour.
418760	421760	The whole place feels like death, like it's haunted or it's creepy.
421760	424760	And the music for the town is also quite creepy, at least as creepy as you can expect from
424760	425760	a Game Boy game.
425760	426760	Have a listen.
426760	452320	Here's the interesting thing, though.
452320	456580	This game came out back in the mid-1990s, and adults who go back and play the game now
456580	460060	have reported that the music in Lavender Town feels off.
460060	462580	Like it doesn't sound like it should, as they remember it sounding.
462580	465800	And this is a widespread phenomenon, it's not just nostalgia goggles kicking in for
465800	467120	one old boomer.
467120	470960	Further investigation of the song actually discovered something very interesting.
470960	475820	The creators of Pokemon wanted Lavender Town to feel creepy, so they used a lot of discordant
475820	479220	notes and high-pitched background hums in the music track.
479220	484260	However, at certain parts of the music, the octave goes so high that teenage and adult
484260	487040	human ears can't actually hear it anymore.
487040	491940	Kids under 12 can, but the human ear commonly loses the ability to hear that frequency over
491940	493160	the course of puberty.
493160	497000	And so, your average adult listening to that part of the track actually can't hear some
497000	498000	of the notes.
498000	500140	However, they can feel it, if that makes sense.
500140	504300	Those people who can't hear the note commonly report mild headaches or blurred vision while
504300	508520	listening to the music, which spawned a whole rumor mill about Japanese kids playing Pokemon
508520	512700	back in the day and then being induced with extreme paranoia or committing suicide, leading
512700	515380	to the music being changed in subsequent releases.
515380	517980	This was all bullshit, but the urban legend persists to this day.
517980	527920	By the way, here's the section of the song in question.
527920	531460	If you can't hear the high-pitched whine in the back of the music, congratulations, your
531460	532700	ears are fully developed.
532700	535340	I still can, though, so I guess I really am a manchild.
535340	539560	At this point, I was thinking, maybe the people who can't hear smoke detector chirps.
539560	544000	It's the case that the chirps just so happen to be in that range that people lose the ability
544000	545620	to hear as they get older?
545620	549720	It's kind of a stretch, and also a serious design flaw in smoke detectors, but maybe
549720	550720	this explains it?
550720	555920	A 2008 study says that, yes, in a more general sense, adults do experience hearing loss as
555920	556920	they age.
556920	560480	But this actually completely destroyed my original idea, because white people suffer
560480	564100	hearing loss at a much higher rate than black people as they get older.
564100	566580	So yeah, it's not that black people can't hear the chirp.
566580	567580	They can hear it.
567580	568580	They just fucking ignore it.
568580	572860	In fact, you can even find videos where they explicitly say, yes, I am ignoring it.
572860	574340	Someone's got to change it, and it's not going to be me.
574340	575580	Like, what the fuck, guys?
575580	579500	And then they even complain when you bring it up, like, keep your nose out of my business.
579500	582820	Okay, let's actually get to the bottom of this, once and for all.
582820	587500	Here's another joke TikTok about the whole thing.
587500	602980	I said, motherfucker, what part about, do you not understand?
602980	610100	Is it the, or the, because everybody on Xbox live can hear how fucking broke you are through
610100	611100	your headset.
611100	612540	You asked for this.
612540	618140	It's been four weeks, three days, 12 hours, and nine minutes.
618140	621300	Get some double A batteries and get the fuck off the couch.
621300	626660	Wait, hey, hey, you son of a bitch, you're going to take, are you taking another battery?
626660	628940	Pretty funny, but it also gives us some insight.
628940	632740	The smoke detector says to the guy, everybody can hear how broke you are.
632740	636380	While some people are lying, are more than willing to chalk this up to race, the predominant
636380	639860	factor seems to be social class, as poor whites do this too.
639860	642780	There's just more poor blacks per capita than poor whites in America.
642780	645460	I can think of a couple of explanations for this behavior.
645460	649520	Some people are actually so fucking poor, they genuinely can't spare the couple of bucks
649520	650620	for a new battery.
650620	654860	Also, some people live in poorer neighborhoods where apartments are crowded together, walls
654860	658900	are thin, and they've simply learned to ignore annoying or intrusive noise to the point that
658900	661620	it's just been filtered out like any other type of white noise.
661620	665180	It's not that they can't hear it, it's that for decades they've categorized it as noise
665180	668020	to ignore rather than noise to deal with.
668020	672260	And like I said in my Portland video a couple days ago, poverty is just as much a mindset
672260	673860	as it is a material condition.
673860	678100	A poor person has developed habits that simply can't be shook out of by giving them a pile
678100	679100	of money.
679100	680320	A great example is us here.
680320	684220	I remember when this channel first started up, the mindset of all of us was, do everything
684220	685780	as cheap as possible.
685780	689220	We can't spend for a good microphone or whatever because we genuinely believed that whatever
689220	692820	little money we had from our day jobs was going to run out, that tomorrow's paycheck
692820	694580	was simply not guaranteed.
694580	699060	Why spend $200 on a quality starter mic if in a month we'll be destitute?
699060	702780	The poor mentality is the genuine belief that there's a decent chance of whatever money
702780	706820	flow you currently have coming in that's keeping your head just above water will be cut off,
706820	709780	so everything is done in the cheapest possible way.
709780	711900	Everything is slapdash and shoestring.
711900	714960	Long term just, quote, isn't a priority right now.
714960	719180	In fact, you can often tell by the terminology some of these people use that they have this
719180	720180	mindset.
720180	723100	You'll often hear something like, well at least I'm doing something when they're asked
723100	726660	about their bare minimum effort, or they'll say, I'm not going to be able to make it when
726660	728180	they're bailing on a prior commitment.
728180	731900	The tone and word choice implies that they feel like the situation is simply out of their
731900	735540	control, that their efforts just aren't good enough, and that they're used to them being
735540	736580	not good enough.
736580	740660	This mentality is often fostered by living in poverty, but getting out of poverty often
740660	741700	doesn't change it.
741700	744140	And yes, this trickles down back to the smoke alarm thing.
744140	749340	A great example of this, by the way, is how Joy Reed, of all fucking people, yes, MSNBC
749340	754780	host and Harvard graduate Joy Reed still can't be fucking arsed to change her batteries on
754780	756780	her smoke detector.
756780	760180	Mr. This is where woke comes to die.
760180	766380	Little mini Ron DeSantis, the little tiny governor of Florida, the tiny and I would
766380	772820	say probably the most functionally racist governor in America, Ron DeSantis.
772820	778500	Turns out he's super anti-immigration, super anti-woke, but his great great grandmother
778540	786820	Luigi Colucci came to the United States, not on the Nina, the Maria or the Santa Maria,
786820	793060	as he might have you believe, given his complete devotion to the founders and to the people
793060	799660	who colonized this country originally and their absolute and total moral goodness.
799660	802960	But actually, his folks came here in 1917.
802960	807780	So Luigi Colucci, his great great grandmother on his mother's side, came to the United States
807780	815940	in February of 1917, a couple of months before the signing of an immigration act, the 1917
815940	819420	Immigration Act, which barred undesirable immigrants.
819420	821380	What were undesirable immigrants back then?
821380	825260	This is why attitudes about debt are very different between poor people and not rich
825260	827040	people, let's say non-poor people.
827040	829140	For a poor person, debt is interest.
829140	831660	You've got to pay more money, which is more problems down the road.
831660	836140	A poor person's advice is never go into debt because they've seen other people go into
836140	837420	debt and get fucked by it.
837540	838960	And you know what, fair enough.
838960	840300	People can get fucked by debt.
840300	841300	It's no joke.
841300	842900	But another way to view debt is as investment.
842900	844740	And this is how I had to think of it.
844740	846020	I had to get out of that.
846020	848860	Why shouldn't I buy a new microphone mindset?
848860	849860	Consider it like this.
849860	852600	Let's say that you want to start up a business, but you don't have the money to buy the equipment
852600	853600	that you need.
853600	856400	So you get a shitty menial job for a year, you save up the cash, and then you launch
856400	857400	your business on the side.
857400	858400	OK, that's great.
858400	859400	In fact, that's what I did.
859400	863200	But alternatively, you could take out a loan and rather than waiting a year, launch your
863200	864200	business right now.
864200	866740	Yes, you'll be on the hook for interest, and that sucks.
866740	870520	But if your business is successful, you'll have launched it one year earlier.
870520	874620	Does the extra money that you make by launching one year earlier, one extra year's worth
874620	877520	of profits, outweigh the interest you had to pay in the loan?
877520	879740	Is there an opportunity cost for not launching?
879740	883300	Like if there's a trend you can ride right now to maximize profit that won't exist
883300	884360	one year later?
884360	885700	You can actually math this out.
885700	890080	And in a lot of cases, not going into debt because you're afraid of the interest ends
890080	892160	up costing you money long term.
892160	894060	Now that is a dangerous road to go down.
894060	896920	Lots of people hear that advice and think, so I can just go into debt and that's fine.
896920	897920	No, no, no.
897920	898920	Debt is a tool.
898920	900960	You need to use it in an intelligent way.
900960	904160	Using debt stupidly is just as dumb as not using it at all.
904160	908200	If you take on debt strategically, you also need to have a solid plan to get out of it.
908200	911760	This is what I mean when I say, and when frankly, a lot of motivational channels also say that
911760	913120	poverty is a mindset.
913120	914480	It's learned helplessness.
914480	919040	You internalize a series of behaviors designed to do the bare minimum because that is genuinely
919040	921160	all that you can do in some cases.
921160	923120	In some cases it isn't, but you just can't see it.
923120	924880	But in some cases, it genuinely is.
924880	928500	There is a middle ground between buying a new pair of shoes every week because you swim
928500	932700	in money and don't care about waste, and riding your old shoes for a decade so hard that you're
932700	936360	super gluing and stapling them back together constantly, when you're causing so many long
936360	939920	term problems to your health that will cost you way more than any savings you're getting
939920	940920	right now.
940920	944980	And this is why poor people don't change the batteries on their smoke alarms, causing everybody
944980	949620	the world over to hate them on Xbox Live voice chat and work Zoom meetings and COVID online
949620	950840	and schooling sessions.
950840	954520	Because in their mind, spending one dollar on a new battery is a high price to pay when
954520	956980	you could literally just live with it and keep the dollar.
956980	960500	For some of them, maybe they're so poor that one dollar actually does break the bank.
960500	963600	But I'm willing to bet that for a lot of them, they simply live in the moment, to the point
963600	966900	that they genuinely feel like tomorrow isn't guaranteed, so it's better to keep that dollar
966900	968080	now just in case.
968080	971220	I'm not shitting on this mentality because I've been poor, and I remember when it actually
971220	975080	was the case that next week's paycheck might not be enough to cover that extra one dollar.
975080	979340	But too many people hold on to this mentality even as they get ahead in life, and it poisons
979340	980900	their future success.
980900	986140	The smoke detector chirp meme is pretty funny, but it often belies a high time preference
986140	987140	mindset.
987140	988140	Also, it's fucking annoying.
988140	991300	I hate listening to you fucks with a goddamn ceiling bird going off.
991300	994220	I don't care how poor you are, change the fucking battery you broke ass ni-
