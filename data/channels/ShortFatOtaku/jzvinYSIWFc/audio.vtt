00:00.000 --> 00:10.400
I guess I'm now on my dev racism arc, because today we're talking about the smoke detector

00:10.400 --> 00:11.680
chirp meme.

00:11.680 --> 00:16.260
Have you ever been playing an online game, maybe on PC, more commonly on Xbox, and you're

00:16.260 --> 00:18.120
talking to people in the game over voice?

00:18.120 --> 00:20.720
Everything's fine, until you realize that one guy in the call?

00:20.720 --> 00:23.680
You can hear his smoke alarm going off in the background?

00:23.680 --> 00:33.660
I don't mean like a constant alarm, like he's got a fire going in his house or something.

00:33.660 --> 00:38.840
I mean like that tiny loud annoying beep every 30 seconds, when the smoke alarm battery is

00:38.840 --> 00:41.500
running low and it needs to be changed.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.500
Like that.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.500
And it just keeps beeping.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.500
I don't know man, how the fuck can you not get annoyed with that?

00:45.500 --> 00:48.840
How can you just sit there and play video games all day while that beep goes off every

00:48.840 --> 00:49.840
30 seconds?

00:49.840 --> 00:50.840
I would fucking lose it.

00:50.840 --> 00:54.760
And yet, there's videos all over the internet right now, of people, yes predominantly black

00:54.760 --> 00:57.600
people, just ignoring the low battery alarm on their smoke detectors.

00:57.600 --> 01:03.760
I want to give you guys a brief history and basic overview of the Tint of Eve 4 spaceship.

01:03.760 --> 01:09.120
It was used by Leia in the original Star Wars film, on the port side airlock hose.

01:09.120 --> 01:12.760
Some of them appear to be slightly embarrassed, like for example this one woman, who's reading

01:12.760 --> 01:16.520
off her old smutty fanfic writing from when she was 16.

01:16.520 --> 01:39.440
Some of them appear to not notice at all, like this young rapper getting interviewed

01:39.440 --> 01:55.800
in his house.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.440
Some of them have done this on national TV, like this American track star who failed a

01:59.440 --> 02:16.000
drug test and is now talking to the news about it.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.920
Apparently this guy recorded his rap song in his house, because the smoke alarm chirp

02:19.920 --> 02:21.480
made it into the cut.

02:21.480 --> 02:28.160
Here's a black woman being interviewed by a black man and the man asks, how in the hell

02:28.160 --> 02:29.400
do you live like this?

02:29.440 --> 02:30.960
And she simply replies, what alarm?

02:30.960 --> 02:31.960
I don't hear anything.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.360
Like red flags?

03:01.360 --> 03:05.640
That smoke detector that's beeping in the background.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.880
There's a smoke detector.

03:08.880 --> 03:12.560
It beeps every 30 seconds and it goes beep.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.240
I don't hear anything beeping.

03:15.240 --> 03:16.240
Did you just hear it again?

03:16.240 --> 03:18.760
Because I don't hear anything.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.760
Wait for it.

03:20.760 --> 03:28.760
Told you guys, they don't hear it after a while.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.760
There it was.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.880
This whole phenomenon came to my attention when Herman Grimm was interviewed for being

03:35.880 --> 03:40.920
given $2 million by New York state as reparations, as compensation for the fact that he failed

03:40.920 --> 03:43.760
the national teacher's examination multiple times.

03:43.760 --> 03:48.760
And they knew I wasn't taking them seriously, because I just wasn't taking them seriously.

03:48.760 --> 03:54.760
You know, why don't you send me letters and tell me about lawsuit, because I know lawsuit

03:54.760 --> 03:57.760
either go through or they won't go through.

03:58.760 --> 04:04.760
You know, but it's when I finally got it in my head, they kept pushing and kept explaining

04:04.760 --> 04:06.760
things piece by piece.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.760
Yes, we're giving money to failures now.

04:08.760 --> 04:09.760
Welcome to 2023.

04:09.760 --> 04:14.760
Their logic is presumably the test was racially biased or some shit when there's no real evidence

04:14.760 --> 04:15.760
to the contrary.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.760
But in any case, throughout the entire interview, you can hear the telltale beep.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.760
Of course, this became a meme real quick.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.760
Lots of people making fun of the whole thing, poking fun at themselves.

04:24.760 --> 04:40.760
This is actually a somewhat historical phenomenon.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.760
You guys know about the radio show Love Line?

04:42.760 --> 04:44.760
It started back in 1983.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.760
People would call in and ask the host for advice about their love life.

04:46.760 --> 04:51.760
As the show went on, the hosts began to notice a correlation between impoverished callers

04:51.760 --> 04:53.760
and a smoke alarm chirp in the background.

05:21.760 --> 05:44.760
You hear that?

05:44.760 --> 05:47.760
She was even surprised the host noticed.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.760
So, what's actually going on here, guys?

05:49.760 --> 05:54.760
Well, a study from 2007 called Waking Effectiveness of Alarm for Adults Who Are Hard of Hearing

05:54.760 --> 06:00.760
showed that your average high-pitched smoke alarm failed to wake 43% of their test participants.

06:00.760 --> 06:04.760
So, it might be the case that some people just can't hear some frequencies.

06:04.760 --> 06:09.760
I've heard the claim online that black people are genetically predisposed to not hear high-pitched

06:09.760 --> 06:13.760
sounds, based on data showing that black people are more likely to die in house fires.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.760
Their logic is, if they can't hear the smoke alarm going off, they're not going to get

06:16.760 --> 06:17.760
out when there's a fire.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.760
But that doesn't intuitively sound right to me.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.760
Why the hell would that be a genetic adaptation?

06:22.760 --> 06:26.760
Even if I were to go full race realist mode, it seems to be the case that the ability to

06:26.760 --> 06:29.760
hear animals with higher-pitched sounds is something that would actually be useful if

06:29.760 --> 06:32.760
your ancestors were adapted to living in Africa.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.760
Okay, well, what if people lose their ability to hear higher-pitched sounds over time?

06:36.760 --> 06:39.760
All the people in today's videos are at least in their early 20s.

06:39.760 --> 06:40.760
And you know what?

06:40.760 --> 06:41.760
That's actually true.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.760
That's what was at the source of the Lavender Town controversy.

06:44.760 --> 06:47.760
For those of you who don't know, Lavender Town is a location in the first generation

06:47.760 --> 06:48.760
of Pokemon games.

06:48.760 --> 06:52.760
It's home to the Pokemon Tower, a cemetery where dead Pokemon are put to rest in little

06:52.760 --> 06:53.760
urns.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.760
The whole town has a drab color scheme.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.760
The characters who are there are predominantly older people who are rather dour.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.760
The whole place feels like death, like it's haunted or it's creepy.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.760
And the music for the town is also quite creepy, at least as creepy as you can expect from

07:04.760 --> 07:05.760
a Game Boy game.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.760
Have a listen.

07:06.760 --> 07:32.320
Here's the interesting thing, though.

07:32.320 --> 07:36.580
This game came out back in the mid-1990s, and adults who go back and play the game now

07:36.580 --> 07:40.060
have reported that the music in Lavender Town feels off.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.580
Like it doesn't sound like it should, as they remember it sounding.

07:42.580 --> 07:45.800
And this is a widespread phenomenon, it's not just nostalgia goggles kicking in for

07:45.800 --> 07:47.120
one old boomer.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.960
Further investigation of the song actually discovered something very interesting.

07:50.960 --> 07:55.820
The creators of Pokemon wanted Lavender Town to feel creepy, so they used a lot of discordant

07:55.820 --> 07:59.220
notes and high-pitched background hums in the music track.

07:59.220 --> 08:04.260
However, at certain parts of the music, the octave goes so high that teenage and adult

08:04.260 --> 08:07.040
human ears can't actually hear it anymore.

08:07.040 --> 08:11.940
Kids under 12 can, but the human ear commonly loses the ability to hear that frequency over

08:11.940 --> 08:13.160
the course of puberty.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.000
And so, your average adult listening to that part of the track actually can't hear some

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
of the notes.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.140
However, they can feel it, if that makes sense.

08:20.140 --> 08:24.300
Those people who can't hear the note commonly report mild headaches or blurred vision while

08:24.300 --> 08:28.520
listening to the music, which spawned a whole rumor mill about Japanese kids playing Pokemon

08:28.520 --> 08:32.700
back in the day and then being induced with extreme paranoia or committing suicide, leading

08:32.700 --> 08:35.380
to the music being changed in subsequent releases.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.980
This was all bullshit, but the urban legend persists to this day.

08:37.980 --> 08:47.920
By the way, here's the section of the song in question.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.460
If you can't hear the high-pitched whine in the back of the music, congratulations, your

08:51.460 --> 08:52.700
ears are fully developed.

08:52.700 --> 08:55.340
I still can, though, so I guess I really am a manchild.

08:55.340 --> 08:59.560
At this point, I was thinking, maybe the people who can't hear smoke detector chirps.

08:59.560 --> 09:04.000
It's the case that the chirps just so happen to be in that range that people lose the ability

09:04.000 --> 09:05.620
to hear as they get older?

09:05.620 --> 09:09.720
It's kind of a stretch, and also a serious design flaw in smoke detectors, but maybe

09:09.720 --> 09:10.720
this explains it?

09:10.720 --> 09:15.920
A 2008 study says that, yes, in a more general sense, adults do experience hearing loss as

09:15.920 --> 09:16.920
they age.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.480
But this actually completely destroyed my original idea, because white people suffer

09:20.480 --> 09:24.100
hearing loss at a much higher rate than black people as they get older.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.580
So yeah, it's not that black people can't hear the chirp.

09:26.580 --> 09:27.580
They can hear it.

09:27.580 --> 09:28.580
They just fucking ignore it.

09:28.580 --> 09:32.860
In fact, you can even find videos where they explicitly say, yes, I am ignoring it.

09:32.860 --> 09:34.340
Someone's got to change it, and it's not going to be me.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.580
Like, what the fuck, guys?

09:35.580 --> 09:39.500
And then they even complain when you bring it up, like, keep your nose out of my business.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.820
Okay, let's actually get to the bottom of this, once and for all.

09:42.820 --> 09:47.500
Here's another joke TikTok about the whole thing.

09:47.500 --> 10:02.980
I said, motherfucker, what part about, do you not understand?

10:02.980 --> 10:10.100
Is it the, or the, because everybody on Xbox live can hear how fucking broke you are through

10:10.100 --> 10:11.100
your headset.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.540
You asked for this.

10:12.540 --> 10:18.140
It's been four weeks, three days, 12 hours, and nine minutes.

10:18.140 --> 10:21.300
Get some double A batteries and get the fuck off the couch.

10:21.300 --> 10:26.660
Wait, hey, hey, you son of a bitch, you're going to take, are you taking another battery?

10:26.660 --> 10:28.940
Pretty funny, but it also gives us some insight.

10:28.940 --> 10:32.740
The smoke detector says to the guy, everybody can hear how broke you are.

10:32.740 --> 10:36.380
While some people are lying, are more than willing to chalk this up to race, the predominant

10:36.380 --> 10:39.860
factor seems to be social class, as poor whites do this too.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.780
There's just more poor blacks per capita than poor whites in America.

10:42.780 --> 10:45.460
I can think of a couple of explanations for this behavior.

10:45.460 --> 10:49.520
Some people are actually so fucking poor, they genuinely can't spare the couple of bucks

10:49.520 --> 10:50.620
for a new battery.

10:50.620 --> 10:54.860
Also, some people live in poorer neighborhoods where apartments are crowded together, walls

10:54.860 --> 10:58.900
are thin, and they've simply learned to ignore annoying or intrusive noise to the point that

10:58.900 --> 11:01.620
it's just been filtered out like any other type of white noise.

11:01.620 --> 11:05.180
It's not that they can't hear it, it's that for decades they've categorized it as noise

11:05.180 --> 11:08.020
to ignore rather than noise to deal with.

11:08.020 --> 11:12.260
And like I said in my Portland video a couple days ago, poverty is just as much a mindset

11:12.260 --> 11:13.860
as it is a material condition.

11:13.860 --> 11:18.100
A poor person has developed habits that simply can't be shook out of by giving them a pile

11:18.100 --> 11:19.100
of money.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.320
A great example is us here.

11:20.320 --> 11:24.220
I remember when this channel first started up, the mindset of all of us was, do everything

11:24.220 --> 11:25.780
as cheap as possible.

11:25.780 --> 11:29.220
We can't spend for a good microphone or whatever because we genuinely believed that whatever

11:29.220 --> 11:32.820
little money we had from our day jobs was going to run out, that tomorrow's paycheck

11:32.820 --> 11:34.580
was simply not guaranteed.

11:34.580 --> 11:39.060
Why spend $200 on a quality starter mic if in a month we'll be destitute?

11:39.060 --> 11:42.780
The poor mentality is the genuine belief that there's a decent chance of whatever money

11:42.780 --> 11:46.820
flow you currently have coming in that's keeping your head just above water will be cut off,

11:46.820 --> 11:49.780
so everything is done in the cheapest possible way.

11:49.780 --> 11:51.900
Everything is slapdash and shoestring.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.960
Long term just, quote, isn't a priority right now.

11:54.960 --> 11:59.180
In fact, you can often tell by the terminology some of these people use that they have this

11:59.180 --> 12:00.180
mindset.

12:00.180 --> 12:03.100
You'll often hear something like, well at least I'm doing something when they're asked

12:03.100 --> 12:06.660
about their bare minimum effort, or they'll say, I'm not going to be able to make it when

12:06.660 --> 12:08.180
they're bailing on a prior commitment.

12:08.180 --> 12:11.900
The tone and word choice implies that they feel like the situation is simply out of their

12:11.900 --> 12:15.540
control, that their efforts just aren't good enough, and that they're used to them being

12:15.540 --> 12:16.580
not good enough.

12:16.580 --> 12:20.660
This mentality is often fostered by living in poverty, but getting out of poverty often

12:20.660 --> 12:21.700
doesn't change it.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.140
And yes, this trickles down back to the smoke alarm thing.

12:24.140 --> 12:29.340
A great example of this, by the way, is how Joy Reed, of all fucking people, yes, MSNBC

12:29.340 --> 12:34.780
host and Harvard graduate Joy Reed still can't be fucking arsed to change her batteries on

12:34.780 --> 12:36.780
her smoke detector.

12:36.780 --> 12:40.180
Mr. This is where woke comes to die.

12:40.180 --> 12:46.380
Little mini Ron DeSantis, the little tiny governor of Florida, the tiny and I would

12:46.380 --> 12:52.820
say probably the most functionally racist governor in America, Ron DeSantis.

12:52.820 --> 12:58.500
Turns out he's super anti-immigration, super anti-woke, but his great great grandmother

12:58.540 --> 13:06.820
Luigi Colucci came to the United States, not on the Nina, the Maria or the Santa Maria,

13:06.820 --> 13:13.060
as he might have you believe, given his complete devotion to the founders and to the people

13:13.060 --> 13:19.660
who colonized this country originally and their absolute and total moral goodness.

13:19.660 --> 13:22.960
But actually, his folks came here in 1917.

13:22.960 --> 13:27.780
So Luigi Colucci, his great great grandmother on his mother's side, came to the United States

13:27.780 --> 13:35.940
in February of 1917, a couple of months before the signing of an immigration act, the 1917

13:35.940 --> 13:39.420
Immigration Act, which barred undesirable immigrants.

13:39.420 --> 13:41.380
What were undesirable immigrants back then?

13:41.380 --> 13:45.260
This is why attitudes about debt are very different between poor people and not rich

13:45.260 --> 13:47.040
people, let's say non-poor people.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.140
For a poor person, debt is interest.

13:49.140 --> 13:51.660
You've got to pay more money, which is more problems down the road.

13:51.660 --> 13:56.140
A poor person's advice is never go into debt because they've seen other people go into

13:56.140 --> 13:57.420
debt and get fucked by it.

13:57.540 --> 13:58.960
And you know what, fair enough.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.300
People can get fucked by debt.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.300
It's no joke.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.900
But another way to view debt is as investment.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.740
And this is how I had to think of it.

14:04.740 --> 14:06.020
I had to get out of that.

14:06.020 --> 14:08.860
Why shouldn't I buy a new microphone mindset?

14:08.860 --> 14:09.860
Consider it like this.

14:09.860 --> 14:12.600
Let's say that you want to start up a business, but you don't have the money to buy the equipment

14:12.600 --> 14:13.600
that you need.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.400
So you get a shitty menial job for a year, you save up the cash, and then you launch

14:16.400 --> 14:17.400
your business on the side.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.400
OK, that's great.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.400
In fact, that's what I did.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.200
But alternatively, you could take out a loan and rather than waiting a year, launch your

14:23.200 --> 14:24.200
business right now.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.740
Yes, you'll be on the hook for interest, and that sucks.

14:26.740 --> 14:30.520
But if your business is successful, you'll have launched it one year earlier.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.620
Does the extra money that you make by launching one year earlier, one extra year's worth

14:34.620 --> 14:37.520
of profits, outweigh the interest you had to pay in the loan?

14:37.520 --> 14:39.740
Is there an opportunity cost for not launching?

14:39.740 --> 14:43.300
Like if there's a trend you can ride right now to maximize profit that won't exist

14:43.300 --> 14:44.360
one year later?

14:44.360 --> 14:45.700
You can actually math this out.

14:45.700 --> 14:50.080
And in a lot of cases, not going into debt because you're afraid of the interest ends

14:50.080 --> 14:52.160
up costing you money long term.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.060
Now that is a dangerous road to go down.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.920
Lots of people hear that advice and think, so I can just go into debt and that's fine.

14:56.920 --> 14:57.920
No, no, no.

14:57.920 --> 14:58.920
Debt is a tool.

14:58.920 --> 15:00.960
You need to use it in an intelligent way.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.160
Using debt stupidly is just as dumb as not using it at all.

15:04.160 --> 15:08.200
If you take on debt strategically, you also need to have a solid plan to get out of it.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.760
This is what I mean when I say, and when frankly, a lot of motivational channels also say that

15:11.760 --> 15:13.120
poverty is a mindset.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.480
It's learned helplessness.

15:14.480 --> 15:19.040
You internalize a series of behaviors designed to do the bare minimum because that is genuinely

15:19.040 --> 15:21.160
all that you can do in some cases.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.120
In some cases it isn't, but you just can't see it.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.880
But in some cases, it genuinely is.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.500
There is a middle ground between buying a new pair of shoes every week because you swim

15:28.500 --> 15:32.700
in money and don't care about waste, and riding your old shoes for a decade so hard that you're

15:32.700 --> 15:36.360
super gluing and stapling them back together constantly, when you're causing so many long

15:36.360 --> 15:39.920
term problems to your health that will cost you way more than any savings you're getting

15:39.920 --> 15:40.920
right now.

15:40.920 --> 15:44.980
And this is why poor people don't change the batteries on their smoke alarms, causing everybody

15:44.980 --> 15:49.620
the world over to hate them on Xbox Live voice chat and work Zoom meetings and COVID online

15:49.620 --> 15:50.840
and schooling sessions.

15:50.840 --> 15:54.520
Because in their mind, spending one dollar on a new battery is a high price to pay when

15:54.520 --> 15:56.980
you could literally just live with it and keep the dollar.

15:56.980 --> 16:00.500
For some of them, maybe they're so poor that one dollar actually does break the bank.

16:00.500 --> 16:03.600
But I'm willing to bet that for a lot of them, they simply live in the moment, to the point

16:03.600 --> 16:06.900
that they genuinely feel like tomorrow isn't guaranteed, so it's better to keep that dollar

16:06.900 --> 16:08.080
now just in case.

16:08.080 --> 16:11.220
I'm not shitting on this mentality because I've been poor, and I remember when it actually

16:11.220 --> 16:15.080
was the case that next week's paycheck might not be enough to cover that extra one dollar.

16:15.080 --> 16:19.340
But too many people hold on to this mentality even as they get ahead in life, and it poisons

16:19.340 --> 16:20.900
their future success.

16:20.900 --> 16:26.140
The smoke detector chirp meme is pretty funny, but it often belies a high time preference

16:26.140 --> 16:27.140
mindset.

16:27.140 --> 16:28.140
Also, it's fucking annoying.

16:28.140 --> 16:31.300
I hate listening to you fucks with a goddamn ceiling bird going off.

16:31.300 --> 16:34.220
I don't care how poor you are, change the fucking battery you broke ass ni-
