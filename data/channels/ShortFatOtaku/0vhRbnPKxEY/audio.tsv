0	5280	Hey buddies, I realized that I haven't actually done one of these political compass tests before.
5280	10240	You'd think I would have over the years, but I don't think I did. At least not on a video.
10240	16960	So, because this test recently remade the rounds on Twitter for some reason that I don't know,
18320	22560	I literally just retook this. I'm exactly where I was in 2015. And in 2010,
22560	28960	my politics haven't really changed. Actually, it turns out, when I took it in 2015,
28960	35840	this red dot was actually one square to the left. So I guess I've shifted just slightly leftward
35840	42160	over time, but I've always been about this far down. I mean, these tests change every time you
42160	46640	take them, right? Sometimes you hover around this area if you're me. I've been a bit further down
46640	51040	the libertarian scale before. I've been a bit further right and further left, but I've always
51040	55920	been around here, so I'm not surprised. And I've always been there. I was there in 2010,
55920	61440	I was there in 2015, I'm there in 2020. But yeah, my politics haven't changed. What's changed is
61440	68000	that people didn't used to call me a fascist back in 2010 for existing down here. Now the common
68000	71600	belief is that if you're not getting more left over time, you might as well be in the blue
71600	78160	square. And that's the case. That's the case. If you exist here or you exist anywhere in here,
79040	82960	people who are like on this final edge here, these final two columns,
83600	88800	they treat you like you're up here. It's kind of ridiculous. But this test isn't the greatest.
88800	92560	So I figure it might be worth doing the eight axis and just kind of going over it, right? You know,
92560	96720	why not? Why not? We all know about this, right? Equality versus markets, nation versus world,
96720	101200	liberty versus authority, and tradition versus progress. Those are the four axes, economic,
101200	107360	diplomatic, civil, and societal. Let's do it. You will be presented with a series of statements.
107360	112720	For each one, click the button with your opinion on it. Okay. Oppression by corporations is
112720	118000	more of a concern than oppression by governments. I disagree. And the main reason that I disagree
118000	122960	is because of the government's monopoly on violence, on the legitimate use of force.
123520	127920	A corporation can't simply kill you. The government can if it's tyrannical.
127920	132080	That's the difference. That's not to say that I don't think corporate oppression isn't real. It
132080	137440	very clearly is. It is a serious problem. It needs to be dealt with. However, I think that government
137440	142720	oppression has more of a capability to be destructive. So I will just slightly disagree.
146800	152640	It is necessary for the government to intervene in the economy to protect consumers. I slightly
152640	157520	agree with this. Yes, only slightly. And it's because there are areas in which there are
157520	162640	natural monopolies. And if that's the case and competition won't actually help the service
162640	166800	become higher quality, then the government does have some kind of a mandate there to step in and
166800	172080	make sure that people have access to the service fairly. However, most monopolies are created by
172080	176400	the government, but in those few cases where monopolies aren't created by the government,
176400	179360	then the government actually has a mandate to get in there. So yeah, I agree.
181120	184560	The fear of the market is the fear of the people. Absolutely. Absolutely. Because you can just
184560	188960	choose what you want to do with your time, your money, your energy, your labor. You can just
188960	194640	choose, you know, choose in the market what you want to do. Yes. It is better to maintain a
194640	200960	balanced budget than to ensure welfare for all citizens. Now, while welfare for citizens is
200960	207680	obviously good, that's generally left to the individual to create for themselves. So I think
207680	212880	for the government, it is better to maintain a balanced budget. So I'm going to like slightly
212880	219280	agree. Publicly funded research is more beneficial to the people than leaving it to the market. I'm
219280	222720	neutral. I'm neutral on this because I think research, no matter where it comes from,
222720	226400	is at least a tool. There's obviously biased research. There's obviously lots of problems
226400	229920	with research. We've seen the scandals coming into the academic sphere recently where, you know,
229920	235520	studies are kind of falsified and people can't recreate them and this and that. But I think if
235520	241680	the research is good, it doesn't matter where it comes from. So neutral. Terrorists on international
241680	247520	trade are important to encourage local production. I slightly agree. Yes. Especially because we're
247520	252480	dealing with someone like China who has no problem just destroying their own population in a race to
252480	257840	outdo the United States and eventually overtake them. So yes, slightly agree. Reach according
257840	260720	to his ability to each according to his needs. Strongly disagree because I'm not a fucking
260720	266960	Marxist. It would be best if social programs were abolished in favor of private charity.
267600	271920	This is a hard one because social programs do a lot of good when they're properly implemented
271920	277200	and they're not corrupt and things are going fine. However, private charity is often more
277200	283920	efficient at what it's trying to do. So should we abolish social programs? No.
283920	288160	Are private charities better at what they do? Generally, yes. So I guess I'm neutral on that.
289600	292960	Taxes should be increased on the rich to provide for the poor.
294160	300560	Um, I mean, yes, but only to a certain extent. There's definitely an argument to be made that,
300560	305200	like, you should tax people who are extraordinarily wealthy and fund, you know,
305200	309280	a basic healthcare system. That's reasonable. Canada does it. The UK does it. It hasn't
309280	314400	destroyed our countries yet. And a shitty healthcare service like the one that Canada has
314400	319280	is better than having no healthcare service and going into debt for millions of dollars over
319280	325200	something, you know, that frankly you shouldn't be going into debt over. Like if, if you're born
325200	329360	with a pre-existing condition and you're just fucked, you know, why should you be owing millions
329360	333280	of dollars? Like it's, it's, it seems a bit unfair. So I, I agree. I don't strongly agree,
333360	338320	but I agree. Inheritance is a legitimate form of wealth. Absolutely. Strongly agree.
338320	342320	Because when you own property, um, it is your right to do, to do whatever you want with it,
342320	346080	including gift it. If you want to gift it to anybody you want, including your kids,
346080	350800	that is legitimate. So I strongly agree. Basic utilities like roads and electricity should be
350800	354880	publicly owned. Um, yeah, I pretty much agree with that too. It was one of those things that
354880	359120	the entire community needs. And there's probably some mandate there to ensure that every citizen
359120	365200	has some kind of fair access to the service. So yeah. Government intervention is a threat
365200	370880	to the economy. I do agree actually quite a bit. Um, again, there are a few tiny instances
370880	374640	where the government intervention might actually save something, but for the most part governments
374640	379600	tend to fuck up economy. So I agree. Those with a greater ability to pay should receive better
379600	384640	healthcare. Yes. Yes. I do agree for, for a minimum standard of care for those people who,
384640	388480	who can't afford it, but there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to pay for something better,
388480	393040	just like private schools. You know, quality education is a right of all people. And now I
393040	398560	know what they mean by this. They're thinking that if you hit disagree, then you think you don't
398560	402960	believe that people deserve to have a quality education. Um, it's not what I believe at all.
402960	406080	I actually do believe that people should have a quality education, but it's not a right.
406080	411680	Rights are very specific things. Rights are things that they're basically infinite in supply.
411680	416640	They can only be taken away from you. They can't be given to you. So quality education is a good
416640	421520	thing and a developed country should be spending a lot of money on its education where necessary,
421520	428320	but is it a right? No. So I will have to slightly disagree. The means of production should belong
428320	432560	to the workers who use them. No, it should belong to the people who made them or bought them. This
432560	437120	is more common bullshit. United nations should be abolished. This is one of the things that I
437760	441440	actually swung on quite a bit in the past five to 10 years. I would, I would have said strongly
441440	445920	disagreed before. Now I agree. Um, and it's mainly because, have you seen the amount of
445920	450800	corrupt shit coming out of the United nations recently? It's kind of wild. Military action
450800	456480	by our nation is often necessary to protect it. Yes, of course. Like any nation can say yes for
456480	461600	this. I support regional unions, such as the European union. Now the thing with regional
461600	466080	unions is that sometimes they're just like trading blocks, which are generally fine.
466080	470560	Sometimes they're military alliances, which are generally fine. The EU, however, is this
470560	475920	neo-lib nightmare proto state that's desperately trying to basically turn all of the countries
475920	481600	into it, into, um, like vassal States. So I disagree with their example of the, of the EU,
481600	486080	but I do believe that regional unions can often be okay. So I'm going to go neutral on it.
487120	490560	It is important to maintain our national sovereignty. Yes, of course it is.
491760	495760	United world government would be beneficial to mankind. No, it would not. It would not because
495760	500880	it's devolution of powers that make societies more free. Like if you're voting for somebody
500880	503920	who lives half a world away, they're not going to give a shit about you. If you're voting for
503920	507600	somebody where the power structure is closer to where you live and is a little bit more,
507600	511200	it's a little bit smaller and therefore it's a little bit more local. It is more likely that
511200	514000	that your needs will be represented by that structure. So strongly disagree.
515040	519680	It is more important to maintain peaceful relations and to further our strength. I think
519680	524320	those are probably equal. You know, you should be strong in case you have to fight, but if you can
524320	527520	opt for peace, then you should opt for peace. So I think I'm going to go neutral on that.
528640	532160	Wars do not need to be justified in other countries. Yeah, I agree with that.
532160	536000	If you have to go to war, it's nobody else's business. You know, some third party who's not
536000	539360	taking any side, they're like, you shouldn't do that. It's like, no, no, maybe there's a reason
539360	542160	you're going to war. Maybe there's a good reason. In fact, so no, I agree with this.
543120	548080	Military spending is a waste of money. I strongly disagree. We live in a world where, and again,
548080	551120	this isn't something that I've probably changed on over the past 10 years, but we live in a world
551200	557680	with a resurgent China. China is fucking everyone everywhere and we need a deterrent, frankly.
557680	561680	The West needs to basically grow a backbone and stand up to them. So strongly disagree.
562480	566720	International aid is a waste of money. I disagree as well. There are definitely times when like
566720	571600	international aid kind of goes to the wrong, goes into the wrong pockets. You know, a little bit
571600	575760	corrupt. People skim a bit too much off the top. Stuff doesn't go to where it's supposed to go,
575760	578880	but when it works, it's obviously good. You know, charity is obviously good.
579840	585200	My nation is great. Yeah, I agree with that. Canada is objectively one of the better nations
585200	590800	in the world. Like there's, there's no comparing us to, you know, some Islamic shithole that
590800	596480	mistreats gay people, mistreats women, you know? No. Yeah. Canada is pretty great. Research should
596480	602000	be conducted on an international scale. I agree with that. You know, generally like it should be
602000	606240	basically if it's something that's important, like space research or like coronavirus research
606400	610480	or something, generally you have multiple space agencies working together for multiple countries.
610480	614560	You have private and public businesses all working together. Like for the coronavirus vaccine,
614560	617440	you know, the Americans, the Canadians, the Brits, the French, and the Germans,
617440	621600	they're all working together on it. Like they all have their own projects, but they're sharing their
621600	627040	research. And I think that is kind of how you get things done if you really need to get things done.
627040	631440	So yeah, I agree. Governments should be accountable to the international community.
631440	639440	I mean, yes and no. Again, like if a government is blatantly violating the human rights of its
639440	645120	citizens, yes. But there are definitely instances where other other countries are just like meddling
645120	647840	and it's like, well, fuck off dude. Like you're not part of this. So I'm going to go neutral
647840	652480	because there are times when this statement is true and times when it's false. So neutral.
654160	657840	Even when protesting an authoritarian government, violence is not acceptable.
658480	663600	Yeah. No. Like if you're fighting a legitimate authoritarian government and you have to actually,
663600	669440	you know, engage in a civil war, then no, like there are times where you have to use violence
669440	673120	against authoritarians, but you have to be measured with it. You have to understand like,
673120	677760	okay, you're, you are now violating the social contract because you believe that your government
677760	684640	is just too authoritarian to, um, to tolerate anymore. And that might be the case, but when
684640	688800	it comes to like the Antifa fucks, they believe that that's the case. And yet it very clearly
688800	693840	isn't. So you have to like, one, you have to win because if you don't win, you're gonna get fucked.
693840	701200	But two, you also have to understand exactly what you're doing. So I disagree, but
702560	707280	there's like, this is a hard one. This is actually really hard. I don't know if I'm neutral or
707280	712640	disagree. I don't know. I'll hit disagree. My religious values should be spread as much as
712640	717360	possible. Um, no, I don't. I mean, I'm an atheist, right? So it doesn't, doesn't really matter. I
717360	720720	don't really have those values. If you want to spread atheism, like go ahead. But I actually
720720	724400	don't, don't really care as long as people aren't hurting anybody. I don't care what they believe.
725600	731120	Our nation's value is very much possible. Yes, because our values are capitalism and liberalism
731120	735360	and democracy. It doesn't matter whether that's parliamentary democracy or whether it's, you know,
735360	741760	Republican democracy, but either way, yeah, we, we live in objectively the best civilizations on
741760	746560	earth right now. It should be spread. It is very important to maintain law and order. Yeah,
746560	750960	generally. Yeah, I agree. I guess I should probably explain that one, right? Sorry. I jumped
750960	754160	ahead too quickly. Um, yeah, like there are definitely times when you have to, when you have
754160	758560	to fight, fight the power. For the most part, democracy is still getting things done. So no,
759440	765040	the general populace makes poor decisions. I'm neutral on this, frankly, because you have some
765040	768320	really dumb fucking people out there who are in positions of power and you have some really
768320	773920	smart people who are kind of, you know, stuck in a hole and can't really do anything because of the
773920	777280	circumstances of their life. Then you also have some dumb people who put themselves there and
777280	781360	then you have some smart people who are where they should be. So like the general populace
782400	787600	is an entire range of people who are very smart and very dumb. So sometimes they make
787600	792560	poor decisions and sometimes they don't. I'm just going to go neutral. Physician assisted suicide
792560	799120	should be legal. Yes. I strongly agree with that. Well, here's the thing, like I strongly agree,
799120	803040	but there's also potential for it to be abused. So there has to be like something there to make
803040	808160	sure it's not abused, but I still strongly agree. Yeah. The sacrifice of some civil liberties is
808160	813440	necessary to protect us from acts of terrorism. No, fuck you NSA. I strongly disagree. Government
813440	818400	surveillance is necessary in the modern world. No, fuck you NSA. I strongly disagree. The very
818400	823760	existence of the state is a threat to our liberty. No, I strongly disagree. The state
824560	830240	should be restrained because its power is, is incredible. And if it's turned on its own people,
830240	835360	that's disastrous, but you still need the state. You still need some kind of apparatus there
835360	841440	to make sure that your rights aren't violated and that something can happen to those people who
841440	846880	violate other people's rights. So, you know, if something, you know, someone steals your purse
846880	850720	on the street and then the cops, you know, the cop who's around the corner sees it, chases after
850720	855680	the robber and like tackles him and then, you know, handcuffs him and takes him away. That is
855680	862480	unprovoked force by the officer, but it's still necessary because that is basically the state
862480	867600	attempting to rectify the violation of your rights. Therefore you need a state. You need
867600	873680	some kind of night watchman. So I disagree. Regardless of political opinions, it is
873680	878160	important to side with your country. I'm neutral on this. You know, there are times in your country
878160	882640	does legitimately evil things and you can't side with it, but then there are times when
883200	887760	your differences are minor and it's time to act because there's a greater evil out there
887760	891520	and you have to kind of go along with it. So I'm neutral. Yeah, I'm neutral.
892960	896240	All authority should be questioned. Yes, of course. Of course it should be.
896240	907120	Okay. Hierarchical state is best. Not only is it best, it's the only type of state that can exist.
908080	914720	Like, no, you don't get your stateless society. You don't get your classless,
914720	919120	you know, governmentless society where everyone just lives in a commune. No, it doesn't exist.
919120	923120	It will never work. We are social creatures. Therefore, we trend toward organization.
923120	928000	Strongly agree. It is important that the government follows the majority opinion,
928000	934880	even if it's wrong. No, the government should not. The government can basically hold a vote
934880	939280	and then the majority can vote to exterminate a minority population. And then the government
939280	945280	should follow that. No, there has to be restraint on government power. We cannot simply bend to the
945280	949520	tyranny of the majority in a democracy. Democracy is important, but it's not the only part. And
949520	955520	there's a reason why it's not the only part. So, I disagree. The stronger the leadership,
955520	961600	the better. I'm neutral in this because, you know, you have strong men who are very clearly just
961600	966240	fascists taking over and then you have strong leadership that is needed but is still legitimate.
966240	971200	So, neutral. Democracy is more than a decision-making process.
972960	975920	I would generally agree with that because it's also representation, isn't it? Like,
975920	981440	you elect people to make decisions in parliament or whatever, but it's not just that. Yeah,
981440	985680	agree. Environmental regulations are essential. I agree. I actually do agree with this.
987280	991040	I think the free market argument falls flat when it comes to the environment because if you have,
991600	998240	say, a company that just dumps a bunch of radioactive waste into the river and then,
998240	1003440	you know, downriver an entire town dies. Yeah, the free market will fix that because that company
1003520	1007920	will go out of business since everyone hates them for killing a town, but we can get to that point
1007920	1012160	with the people in the town dying, right? Like, there are some things government can do and I
1012160	1018240	think environmental regulation is one of them. So, I agree. A better world will come from automation,
1018240	1022400	science, technology. I strongly agree, actually. I think our future is pretty bright, all things
1022400	1028960	considered. Children should be educated in religious or traditional values. Neutral on this.
1028960	1034800	Neutral. Maybe even disagree. It's up to them. It's up to the kids to figure out where they
1034800	1040880	want to go in their lives, you know? So, let's just choose neutral. Traditions are of no value
1040880	1045680	on their own. Absolutely not. And I'm not even a traditionalist, but they obviously have some
1045680	1051040	value. There's obviously something that is more than the sum of its parts holding cultures
1051040	1056720	together. And even though it's important to challenge traditions, even though it's important
1056720	1061280	to discard traditions when necessary, when they've become tyrannical or they've become oppressive,
1061280	1066160	even when it's important to change traditions or introduce new ones, the tradition itself still
1066160	1071680	has some value. So, I disagree. Religion should play a role in government. No, it should not.
1071680	1078400	Strongly disagree. Churches should be taxed the same way that other institutions are taxed. Yeah,
1078400	1081360	I don't see why not, you know? If money changes hands, it should be taxed.
1081360	1086720	Climate change is currently one of the greatest threats to our way of life.
1086720	1092640	See, I don't think it is. I think climate change is real, but I think the great ecological
1092640	1096960	disaster of our time is not even climate change. It's plastic in the oceans. That's a very different
1096960	1102320	problem. Climate change is small potatoes compared to plastic in the oceans. So, I'm kind of neutral
1102320	1108320	on this. I mean, it's not. No, I guess I disagree. It is not. It is a threat, but it is not nearly
1108320	1114960	one of the greatest threats. It is important that we work as a united world to combat climate change.
1114960	1119360	Now, this I can actually agree with because even though climate change is not one of the greatest
1119360	1124560	threats, it is still somewhat of a threat and it will take everyone getting involved in order to
1124560	1129280	fix the problem. You know, Canada and the US and Europe and all these other places, they can do
1129280	1133440	their part, but if China and India just don't give a shit, the problem is not going to get fixed.
1133440	1140880	In fact, like, Canada outputs what, like one, two percent of the entire world's emissions?
1140880	1145840	We can't do shit. All of our politicians over here in Canada, they're like, we go to solve the
1145840	1150320	crisis. No, we can't do anything, dude. We're a small player in this regard. We can't do shit,
1151520	1156640	but I agree. Society was better many years ago than it is now. I strongly disagree.
1156640	1161040	There is no time other than this era, you know, the modern era, the internet era, that I would
1161040	1165200	rather have been alive. This is great, man. All things considered, things are getting better for
1165200	1170160	everyone at a pace we've never seen before. We literally live in a golden age of everything.
1170160	1175440	This is amazing. It is important that we maintain the traditions of our past. Yeah,
1175440	1180240	like a little bit, sure. Like, I don't agree with all traditions. However, it is people's
1180240	1187760	freedom to do so. And also, they're not all bad, you know, so agree. It is important that we think
1187760	1191840	in the long term beyond our lifespans. Yes, I also agree with this. There are things that need
1191840	1194800	to be done that we won't actually see the fruits of, you know, at some point, we're going to have
1194800	1199840	to go to the stars and you and I won't see that. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't at least, you
1199840	1207280	know, put a few bricks in that wall. You know, let's agree. Reason is more important than
1207280	1213280	maintaining our culture. Yeah, I'm neutral on that one. Partially because our culture is reason,
1213280	1219120	but also partially because, like, you can't simply have your culture. You can't simply
1219120	1226000	have your traditions because they're old, they're stale. Sometimes they don't understand what's
1226000	1231120	going on. But reason, you know, the world of pure reason where there's no spiritual side to life,
1231680	1236960	that can be equally destructive. So I am neutral on this because I think they're equally as
1236960	1242320	important. Drug use should be legalized or decriminalized. Strongly agree. Absolutely.
1242320	1246800	People should be able to do whatever they want. Within reason, obviously. Same sex marriage should
1246800	1250400	be legal. Yes, of course. The state has no business manning this either. Strongly agree.
1250400	1254960	It's a human rights issue. No cultures are superior to others. Strongly disagree.
1257280	1262080	Backwards ass Islamic shitholes are objectively inferior to Western culture.
1263680	1268720	Sex outside marriage is immoral. Strongly disagree. People can do whatever the fuck
1268720	1274400	they want, man. Like this is their freedom. If we accept migrants at all, it is important
1274400	1279760	that they assimilate into our culture. Strongly agree with this one. Of course. Again, if they're
1279760	1284560	coming from shitholes and they want to come here to be Canadians, they are welcome to come here to
1284560	1291840	be Canadians, but they have to become Canadians. Abortions should be prohibited in most or all
1291840	1297200	cases. Strongly disagree. Gun ownership should be prohibited for those without a valid reason.
1298000	1302720	Again, strongly disagree. This is that personal freedom thing coming through.
1304000	1311200	I support single-payer universal healthcare. Yeah. Prostitution should be illegal. Strongly
1311200	1316480	disagree as well. Do whatever you want. This is the libertarian in me coming out. Do whatever
1316480	1320800	you want as long as you're not hurting somebody else. The government should have no say. That's
1320800	1324640	not me saying that I think those things are good, but it is me saying that the government
1324640	1332960	shouldn't stop you. Maintaining family values is essential. Yeah, I actually agree. It is.
1332960	1336240	If you're raising a family, there should be some family values there. You can't just like,
1336240	1341200	you know, mistreat your kids or something. I know that the feminists like to say that
1341200	1345680	the nuclear family is oppressive, but it really isn't. And the destruction of the
1345680	1350240	nuclear family has kind of harmed the black community in multi-generational ways. So let's
1350240	1357200	go with agree here. Chase progress at all costs is dangerous. I agree as well. Because like,
1358320	1365200	most people who say that they're progressives, they like, they do some weird fucking shit and
1365200	1369600	they believe some weird things in the name of progress, man. And they think that what
1369600	1374320	they're chasing is progress, but it's not like, that's the thing. When you chase progress,
1374320	1379360	you often don't get it. You often just overshoot the mark and fucking destroy everything.
1380400	1386480	The idea is not to chase progress. The idea is to run away from destruction and through
1386480	1390560	process of elimination, you'll get there eventually. It's the difference between
1391840	1397520	doing good and not doing evil. There's a pretty big difference there. So I agree with the statement.
1398640	1404240	Genetic modification is a force for good, even on humans. Yeah. I mean, I don't mind the whole
1404240	1408640	designer babies thing. It might be weird in the future, but like, I don't mind the idea of
1408720	1413760	tinkering with genes once the process becomes reliable to make the species better. I don't
1413760	1421280	care about that at all. I'm like, I'm neutral on it in that I don't care, but I agree with it
1421280	1428480	in that if it works, it's like, yes, sure. Okay, sure. We should open our borders to immigration.
1428480	1435440	I mean, yes, but not to the levels that we're currently opening them to. So like, I agree,
1435440	1440480	but I don't strongly agree. Governments should be as concerned about foreigners as they are
1440480	1448240	about their own citizens. I mean, I fluctuate between neutral and disagree because unless it's
1449440	1454160	some kind of Holocaust happening, like China genociding the Uyghurs or something,
1454160	1459360	unless that's going on, I don't think our government has any business in anybody else's
1459360	1464880	affairs. It's their affairs. If the people elected that other government and that other government
1464880	1470080	is doing what the people want, and they're not like wholesale butchering a population,
1471040	1473520	then I don't think you have a place to say anything, you know?
1476000	1480720	So like, I mean, here, should be as concerned? No, no.
1483600	1485600	This is hard. I don't know.
1485600	1496720	I'll choose disagree just because it's that one extreme situation where I agree with this,
1496720	1501440	so I'll just choose disagree. All people, regardless of factors like culture, sexuality
1501440	1506480	should be treated equally. Yes, always. Treat people as individuals. Do not simply judge them
1506480	1512880	by their culture. It is important that we further my group's goals above all others. No, no. I mean,
1513600	1516400	it first of all, this is a very vague statement, but like,
1516400	1520080	generally no, like my group is humanity in a sense.
1523280	1530080	Here we go. Check it out. Centrist economic access. This is I'm slightly more markets than
1530080	1538960	equality. Okay. Diplomatic access to balanced. I am 60 nation, 40 world. Okay. Civil access,
1538960	1544640	moderate. I am 60 Liberty, 40 authority. All right. Societal access, progressive.
1545200	1552480	I am 40% tradition, 60% progress liberalism. Now I've done this before.
1553680	1560400	And last time I did it, I got centrism. I have fluctuated between centrism, liberalism,
1560400	1566720	and libertarianism. And they all look kind of like this. You know, it's generally a 60,
1566720	1574320	40 split with markets coming in over a quality nation coming in over world Liberty coming in
1574320	1579280	over authority and progress coming in over tradition. It's generally a 60, 40 split though
1579280	1586480	with each one, which means that it's not like I'm massively nation over world. It's only that
1586480	1591680	it's usually a 60, 40 split. So yeah, I am a liberal. Now I know that you can get like,
1592320	1595200	you can get like centrist here. You can get libertarian here.
1595200	1599920	You can even get neoliberal here, but I didn't get, I've never gotten neoliberal.
1599920	1607200	This is liberalism. So there are a lot of people out there who call me a Nazi, a fascist,
1608400	1614240	an alt-right shud, a reactionary. No, I'm just a liberal. I've always been a liberal.
1614240	1619840	This is very close to what I got five years ago. It is very close to what I got 10 years ago.
1619920	1626400	I have always only been a liberal. Thanks for coming along with me on this ride guys. It was
1627360	1631760	a lot of fun. Real videos coming back tomorrow. I know there's been a drought recently. I'm sorry.
1632880	1637760	I am working on the Kyle Rittenhouse video. It's just that it's a deep dive. All right. It's
1637760	1640640	coming, but it's going to be one of those big videos. It's going to be like Chaz. It's going
1640640	1646240	to be a big situation. So it's coming, but you will see it later. I have two dumping with scrumps
1646480	1650480	that I've recorded that haven't put out yet. Those will come out soon. But yeah,
1650480	1654880	videos are coming back. Thanks very much. Oh, and also I'm streaming pretty much right when
1654880	1659440	you see this, I'll be streaming on Twitch. So drop by and say hi there. I will see you
1659440	1664960	for tomorrow's video or for tonight's stream. Thanks for watching guys. I love you.
