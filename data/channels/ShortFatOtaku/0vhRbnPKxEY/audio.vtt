00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
Hey buddies, I realized that I haven't actually done one of these political compass tests before.

00:05.280 --> 00:10.240
You'd think I would have over the years, but I don't think I did. At least not on a video.

00:10.240 --> 00:16.960
So, because this test recently remade the rounds on Twitter for some reason that I don't know,

00:18.320 --> 00:22.560
I literally just retook this. I'm exactly where I was in 2015. And in 2010,

00:22.560 --> 00:28.960
my politics haven't really changed. Actually, it turns out, when I took it in 2015,

00:28.960 --> 00:35.840
this red dot was actually one square to the left. So I guess I've shifted just slightly leftward

00:35.840 --> 00:42.160
over time, but I've always been about this far down. I mean, these tests change every time you

00:42.160 --> 00:46.640
take them, right? Sometimes you hover around this area if you're me. I've been a bit further down

00:46.640 --> 00:51.040
the libertarian scale before. I've been a bit further right and further left, but I've always

00:51.040 --> 00:55.920
been around here, so I'm not surprised. And I've always been there. I was there in 2010,

00:55.920 --> 01:01.440
I was there in 2015, I'm there in 2020. But yeah, my politics haven't changed. What's changed is

01:01.440 --> 01:08.000
that people didn't used to call me a fascist back in 2010 for existing down here. Now the common

01:08.000 --> 01:11.600
belief is that if you're not getting more left over time, you might as well be in the blue

01:11.600 --> 01:18.160
square. And that's the case. That's the case. If you exist here or you exist anywhere in here,

01:19.040 --> 01:22.960
people who are like on this final edge here, these final two columns,

01:23.600 --> 01:28.800
they treat you like you're up here. It's kind of ridiculous. But this test isn't the greatest.

01:28.800 --> 01:32.560
So I figure it might be worth doing the eight axis and just kind of going over it, right? You know,

01:32.560 --> 01:36.720
why not? Why not? We all know about this, right? Equality versus markets, nation versus world,

01:36.720 --> 01:41.200
liberty versus authority, and tradition versus progress. Those are the four axes, economic,

01:41.200 --> 01:47.360
diplomatic, civil, and societal. Let's do it. You will be presented with a series of statements.

01:47.360 --> 01:52.720
For each one, click the button with your opinion on it. Okay. Oppression by corporations is

01:52.720 --> 01:58.000
more of a concern than oppression by governments. I disagree. And the main reason that I disagree

01:58.000 --> 02:02.960
is because of the government's monopoly on violence, on the legitimate use of force.

02:03.520 --> 02:07.920
A corporation can't simply kill you. The government can if it's tyrannical.

02:07.920 --> 02:12.080
That's the difference. That's not to say that I don't think corporate oppression isn't real. It

02:12.080 --> 02:17.440
very clearly is. It is a serious problem. It needs to be dealt with. However, I think that government

02:17.440 --> 02:22.720
oppression has more of a capability to be destructive. So I will just slightly disagree.

02:26.800 --> 02:32.640
It is necessary for the government to intervene in the economy to protect consumers. I slightly

02:32.640 --> 02:37.520
agree with this. Yes, only slightly. And it's because there are areas in which there are

02:37.520 --> 02:42.640
natural monopolies. And if that's the case and competition won't actually help the service

02:42.640 --> 02:46.800
become higher quality, then the government does have some kind of a mandate there to step in and

02:46.800 --> 02:52.080
make sure that people have access to the service fairly. However, most monopolies are created by

02:52.080 --> 02:56.400
the government, but in those few cases where monopolies aren't created by the government,

02:56.400 --> 02:59.360
then the government actually has a mandate to get in there. So yeah, I agree.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.560
The fear of the market is the fear of the people. Absolutely. Absolutely. Because you can just

03:04.560 --> 03:08.960
choose what you want to do with your time, your money, your energy, your labor. You can just

03:08.960 --> 03:14.640
choose, you know, choose in the market what you want to do. Yes. It is better to maintain a

03:14.640 --> 03:20.960
balanced budget than to ensure welfare for all citizens. Now, while welfare for citizens is

03:20.960 --> 03:27.680
obviously good, that's generally left to the individual to create for themselves. So I think

03:27.680 --> 03:32.880
for the government, it is better to maintain a balanced budget. So I'm going to like slightly

03:32.880 --> 03:39.280
agree. Publicly funded research is more beneficial to the people than leaving it to the market. I'm

03:39.280 --> 03:42.720
neutral. I'm neutral on this because I think research, no matter where it comes from,

03:42.720 --> 03:46.400
is at least a tool. There's obviously biased research. There's obviously lots of problems

03:46.400 --> 03:49.920
with research. We've seen the scandals coming into the academic sphere recently where, you know,

03:49.920 --> 03:55.520
studies are kind of falsified and people can't recreate them and this and that. But I think if

03:55.520 --> 04:01.680
the research is good, it doesn't matter where it comes from. So neutral. Terrorists on international

04:01.680 --> 04:07.520
trade are important to encourage local production. I slightly agree. Yes. Especially because we're

04:07.520 --> 04:12.480
dealing with someone like China who has no problem just destroying their own population in a race to

04:12.480 --> 04:17.840
outdo the United States and eventually overtake them. So yes, slightly agree. Reach according

04:17.840 --> 04:20.720
to his ability to each according to his needs. Strongly disagree because I'm not a fucking

04:20.720 --> 04:26.960
Marxist. It would be best if social programs were abolished in favor of private charity.

04:27.600 --> 04:31.920
This is a hard one because social programs do a lot of good when they're properly implemented

04:31.920 --> 04:37.200
and they're not corrupt and things are going fine. However, private charity is often more

04:37.200 --> 04:43.920
efficient at what it's trying to do. So should we abolish social programs? No.

04:43.920 --> 04:48.160
Are private charities better at what they do? Generally, yes. So I guess I'm neutral on that.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.960
Taxes should be increased on the rich to provide for the poor.

04:54.160 --> 05:00.560
Um, I mean, yes, but only to a certain extent. There's definitely an argument to be made that,

05:00.560 --> 05:05.200
like, you should tax people who are extraordinarily wealthy and fund, you know,

05:05.200 --> 05:09.280
a basic healthcare system. That's reasonable. Canada does it. The UK does it. It hasn't

05:09.280 --> 05:14.400
destroyed our countries yet. And a shitty healthcare service like the one that Canada has

05:14.400 --> 05:19.280
is better than having no healthcare service and going into debt for millions of dollars over

05:19.280 --> 05:25.200
something, you know, that frankly you shouldn't be going into debt over. Like if, if you're born

05:25.200 --> 05:29.360
with a pre-existing condition and you're just fucked, you know, why should you be owing millions

05:29.360 --> 05:33.280
of dollars? Like it's, it's, it seems a bit unfair. So I, I agree. I don't strongly agree,

05:33.360 --> 05:38.320
but I agree. Inheritance is a legitimate form of wealth. Absolutely. Strongly agree.

05:38.320 --> 05:42.320
Because when you own property, um, it is your right to do, to do whatever you want with it,

05:42.320 --> 05:46.080
including gift it. If you want to gift it to anybody you want, including your kids,

05:46.080 --> 05:50.800
that is legitimate. So I strongly agree. Basic utilities like roads and electricity should be

05:50.800 --> 05:54.880
publicly owned. Um, yeah, I pretty much agree with that too. It was one of those things that

05:54.880 --> 05:59.120
the entire community needs. And there's probably some mandate there to ensure that every citizen

05:59.120 --> 06:05.200
has some kind of fair access to the service. So yeah. Government intervention is a threat

06:05.200 --> 06:10.880
to the economy. I do agree actually quite a bit. Um, again, there are a few tiny instances

06:10.880 --> 06:14.640
where the government intervention might actually save something, but for the most part governments

06:14.640 --> 06:19.600
tend to fuck up economy. So I agree. Those with a greater ability to pay should receive better

06:19.600 --> 06:24.640
healthcare. Yes. Yes. I do agree for, for a minimum standard of care for those people who,

06:24.640 --> 06:28.480
who can't afford it, but there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to pay for something better,

06:28.480 --> 06:33.040
just like private schools. You know, quality education is a right of all people. And now I

06:33.040 --> 06:38.560
know what they mean by this. They're thinking that if you hit disagree, then you think you don't

06:38.560 --> 06:42.960
believe that people deserve to have a quality education. Um, it's not what I believe at all.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.080
I actually do believe that people should have a quality education, but it's not a right.

06:46.080 --> 06:51.680
Rights are very specific things. Rights are things that they're basically infinite in supply.

06:51.680 --> 06:56.640
They can only be taken away from you. They can't be given to you. So quality education is a good

06:56.640 --> 07:01.520
thing and a developed country should be spending a lot of money on its education where necessary,

07:01.520 --> 07:08.320
but is it a right? No. So I will have to slightly disagree. The means of production should belong

07:08.320 --> 07:12.560
to the workers who use them. No, it should belong to the people who made them or bought them. This

07:12.560 --> 07:17.120
is more common bullshit. United nations should be abolished. This is one of the things that I

07:17.760 --> 07:21.440
actually swung on quite a bit in the past five to 10 years. I would, I would have said strongly

07:21.440 --> 07:25.920
disagreed before. Now I agree. Um, and it's mainly because, have you seen the amount of

07:25.920 --> 07:30.800
corrupt shit coming out of the United nations recently? It's kind of wild. Military action

07:30.800 --> 07:36.480
by our nation is often necessary to protect it. Yes, of course. Like any nation can say yes for

07:36.480 --> 07:41.600
this. I support regional unions, such as the European union. Now the thing with regional

07:41.600 --> 07:46.080
unions is that sometimes they're just like trading blocks, which are generally fine.

07:46.080 --> 07:50.560
Sometimes they're military alliances, which are generally fine. The EU, however, is this

07:50.560 --> 07:55.920
neo-lib nightmare proto state that's desperately trying to basically turn all of the countries

07:55.920 --> 08:01.600
into it, into, um, like vassal States. So I disagree with their example of the, of the EU,

08:01.600 --> 08:06.080
but I do believe that regional unions can often be okay. So I'm going to go neutral on it.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.560
It is important to maintain our national sovereignty. Yes, of course it is.

08:11.760 --> 08:15.760
United world government would be beneficial to mankind. No, it would not. It would not because

08:15.760 --> 08:20.880
it's devolution of powers that make societies more free. Like if you're voting for somebody

08:20.880 --> 08:23.920
who lives half a world away, they're not going to give a shit about you. If you're voting for

08:23.920 --> 08:27.600
somebody where the power structure is closer to where you live and is a little bit more,

08:27.600 --> 08:31.200
it's a little bit smaller and therefore it's a little bit more local. It is more likely that

08:31.200 --> 08:34.000
that your needs will be represented by that structure. So strongly disagree.

08:35.040 --> 08:39.680
It is more important to maintain peaceful relations and to further our strength. I think

08:39.680 --> 08:44.320
those are probably equal. You know, you should be strong in case you have to fight, but if you can

08:44.320 --> 08:47.520
opt for peace, then you should opt for peace. So I think I'm going to go neutral on that.

08:48.640 --> 08:52.160
Wars do not need to be justified in other countries. Yeah, I agree with that.

08:52.160 --> 08:56.000
If you have to go to war, it's nobody else's business. You know, some third party who's not

08:56.000 --> 08:59.360
taking any side, they're like, you shouldn't do that. It's like, no, no, maybe there's a reason

08:59.360 --> 09:02.160
you're going to war. Maybe there's a good reason. In fact, so no, I agree with this.

09:03.120 --> 09:08.080
Military spending is a waste of money. I strongly disagree. We live in a world where, and again,

09:08.080 --> 09:11.120
this isn't something that I've probably changed on over the past 10 years, but we live in a world

09:11.200 --> 09:17.680
with a resurgent China. China is fucking everyone everywhere and we need a deterrent, frankly.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.680
The West needs to basically grow a backbone and stand up to them. So strongly disagree.

09:22.480 --> 09:26.720
International aid is a waste of money. I disagree as well. There are definitely times when like

09:26.720 --> 09:31.600
international aid kind of goes to the wrong, goes into the wrong pockets. You know, a little bit

09:31.600 --> 09:35.760
corrupt. People skim a bit too much off the top. Stuff doesn't go to where it's supposed to go,

09:35.760 --> 09:38.880
but when it works, it's obviously good. You know, charity is obviously good.

09:39.840 --> 09:45.200
My nation is great. Yeah, I agree with that. Canada is objectively one of the better nations

09:45.200 --> 09:50.800
in the world. Like there's, there's no comparing us to, you know, some Islamic shithole that

09:50.800 --> 09:56.480
mistreats gay people, mistreats women, you know? No. Yeah. Canada is pretty great. Research should

09:56.480 --> 10:02.000
be conducted on an international scale. I agree with that. You know, generally like it should be

10:02.000 --> 10:06.240
basically if it's something that's important, like space research or like coronavirus research

10:06.400 --> 10:10.480
or something, generally you have multiple space agencies working together for multiple countries.

10:10.480 --> 10:14.560
You have private and public businesses all working together. Like for the coronavirus vaccine,

10:14.560 --> 10:17.440
you know, the Americans, the Canadians, the Brits, the French, and the Germans,

10:17.440 --> 10:21.600
they're all working together on it. Like they all have their own projects, but they're sharing their

10:21.600 --> 10:27.040
research. And I think that is kind of how you get things done if you really need to get things done.

10:27.040 --> 10:31.440
So yeah, I agree. Governments should be accountable to the international community.

10:31.440 --> 10:39.440
I mean, yes and no. Again, like if a government is blatantly violating the human rights of its

10:39.440 --> 10:45.120
citizens, yes. But there are definitely instances where other other countries are just like meddling

10:45.120 --> 10:47.840
and it's like, well, fuck off dude. Like you're not part of this. So I'm going to go neutral

10:47.840 --> 10:52.480
because there are times when this statement is true and times when it's false. So neutral.

10:54.160 --> 10:57.840
Even when protesting an authoritarian government, violence is not acceptable.

10:58.480 --> 11:03.600
Yeah. No. Like if you're fighting a legitimate authoritarian government and you have to actually,

11:03.600 --> 11:09.440
you know, engage in a civil war, then no, like there are times where you have to use violence

11:09.440 --> 11:13.120
against authoritarians, but you have to be measured with it. You have to understand like,

11:13.120 --> 11:17.760
okay, you're, you are now violating the social contract because you believe that your government

11:17.760 --> 11:24.640
is just too authoritarian to, um, to tolerate anymore. And that might be the case, but when

11:24.640 --> 11:28.800
it comes to like the Antifa fucks, they believe that that's the case. And yet it very clearly

11:28.800 --> 11:33.840
isn't. So you have to like, one, you have to win because if you don't win, you're gonna get fucked.

11:33.840 --> 11:41.200
But two, you also have to understand exactly what you're doing. So I disagree, but

11:42.560 --> 11:47.280
there's like, this is a hard one. This is actually really hard. I don't know if I'm neutral or

11:47.280 --> 11:52.640
disagree. I don't know. I'll hit disagree. My religious values should be spread as much as

11:52.640 --> 11:57.360
possible. Um, no, I don't. I mean, I'm an atheist, right? So it doesn't, doesn't really matter. I

11:57.360 --> 12:00.720
don't really have those values. If you want to spread atheism, like go ahead. But I actually

12:00.720 --> 12:04.400
don't, don't really care as long as people aren't hurting anybody. I don't care what they believe.

12:05.600 --> 12:11.120
Our nation's value is very much possible. Yes, because our values are capitalism and liberalism

12:11.120 --> 12:15.360
and democracy. It doesn't matter whether that's parliamentary democracy or whether it's, you know,

12:15.360 --> 12:21.760
Republican democracy, but either way, yeah, we, we live in objectively the best civilizations on

12:21.760 --> 12:26.560
earth right now. It should be spread. It is very important to maintain law and order. Yeah,

12:26.560 --> 12:30.960
generally. Yeah, I agree. I guess I should probably explain that one, right? Sorry. I jumped

12:30.960 --> 12:34.160
ahead too quickly. Um, yeah, like there are definitely times when you have to, when you have

12:34.160 --> 12:38.560
to fight, fight the power. For the most part, democracy is still getting things done. So no,

12:39.440 --> 12:45.040
the general populace makes poor decisions. I'm neutral on this, frankly, because you have some

12:45.040 --> 12:48.320
really dumb fucking people out there who are in positions of power and you have some really

12:48.320 --> 12:53.920
smart people who are kind of, you know, stuck in a hole and can't really do anything because of the

12:53.920 --> 12:57.280
circumstances of their life. Then you also have some dumb people who put themselves there and

12:57.280 --> 13:01.360
then you have some smart people who are where they should be. So like the general populace

13:02.400 --> 13:07.600
is an entire range of people who are very smart and very dumb. So sometimes they make

13:07.600 --> 13:12.560
poor decisions and sometimes they don't. I'm just going to go neutral. Physician assisted suicide

13:12.560 --> 13:19.120
should be legal. Yes. I strongly agree with that. Well, here's the thing, like I strongly agree,

13:19.120 --> 13:23.040
but there's also potential for it to be abused. So there has to be like something there to make

13:23.040 --> 13:28.160
sure it's not abused, but I still strongly agree. Yeah. The sacrifice of some civil liberties is

13:28.160 --> 13:33.440
necessary to protect us from acts of terrorism. No, fuck you NSA. I strongly disagree. Government

13:33.440 --> 13:38.400
surveillance is necessary in the modern world. No, fuck you NSA. I strongly disagree. The very

13:38.400 --> 13:43.760
existence of the state is a threat to our liberty. No, I strongly disagree. The state

13:44.560 --> 13:50.240
should be restrained because its power is, is incredible. And if it's turned on its own people,

13:50.240 --> 13:55.360
that's disastrous, but you still need the state. You still need some kind of apparatus there

13:55.360 --> 14:01.440
to make sure that your rights aren't violated and that something can happen to those people who

14:01.440 --> 14:06.880
violate other people's rights. So, you know, if something, you know, someone steals your purse

14:06.880 --> 14:10.720
on the street and then the cops, you know, the cop who's around the corner sees it, chases after

14:10.720 --> 14:15.680
the robber and like tackles him and then, you know, handcuffs him and takes him away. That is

14:15.680 --> 14:22.480
unprovoked force by the officer, but it's still necessary because that is basically the state

14:22.480 --> 14:27.600
attempting to rectify the violation of your rights. Therefore you need a state. You need

14:27.600 --> 14:33.680
some kind of night watchman. So I disagree. Regardless of political opinions, it is

14:33.680 --> 14:38.160
important to side with your country. I'm neutral on this. You know, there are times in your country

14:38.160 --> 14:42.640
does legitimately evil things and you can't side with it, but then there are times when

14:43.200 --> 14:47.760
your differences are minor and it's time to act because there's a greater evil out there

14:47.760 --> 14:51.520
and you have to kind of go along with it. So I'm neutral. Yeah, I'm neutral.

14:52.960 --> 14:56.240
All authority should be questioned. Yes, of course. Of course it should be.

14:56.240 --> 15:07.120
Okay. Hierarchical state is best. Not only is it best, it's the only type of state that can exist.

15:08.080 --> 15:14.720
Like, no, you don't get your stateless society. You don't get your classless,

15:14.720 --> 15:19.120
you know, governmentless society where everyone just lives in a commune. No, it doesn't exist.

15:19.120 --> 15:23.120
It will never work. We are social creatures. Therefore, we trend toward organization.

15:23.120 --> 15:28.000
Strongly agree. It is important that the government follows the majority opinion,

15:28.000 --> 15:34.880
even if it's wrong. No, the government should not. The government can basically hold a vote

15:34.880 --> 15:39.280
and then the majority can vote to exterminate a minority population. And then the government

15:39.280 --> 15:45.280
should follow that. No, there has to be restraint on government power. We cannot simply bend to the

15:45.280 --> 15:49.520
tyranny of the majority in a democracy. Democracy is important, but it's not the only part. And

15:49.520 --> 15:55.520
there's a reason why it's not the only part. So, I disagree. The stronger the leadership,

15:55.520 --> 16:01.600
the better. I'm neutral in this because, you know, you have strong men who are very clearly just

16:01.600 --> 16:06.240
fascists taking over and then you have strong leadership that is needed but is still legitimate.

16:06.240 --> 16:11.200
So, neutral. Democracy is more than a decision-making process.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.920
I would generally agree with that because it's also representation, isn't it? Like,

16:15.920 --> 16:21.440
you elect people to make decisions in parliament or whatever, but it's not just that. Yeah,

16:21.440 --> 16:25.680
agree. Environmental regulations are essential. I agree. I actually do agree with this.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.040
I think the free market argument falls flat when it comes to the environment because if you have,

16:31.600 --> 16:38.240
say, a company that just dumps a bunch of radioactive waste into the river and then,

16:38.240 --> 16:43.440
you know, downriver an entire town dies. Yeah, the free market will fix that because that company

16:43.520 --> 16:47.920
will go out of business since everyone hates them for killing a town, but we can get to that point

16:47.920 --> 16:52.160
with the people in the town dying, right? Like, there are some things government can do and I

16:52.160 --> 16:58.240
think environmental regulation is one of them. So, I agree. A better world will come from automation,

16:58.240 --> 17:02.400
science, technology. I strongly agree, actually. I think our future is pretty bright, all things

17:02.400 --> 17:08.960
considered. Children should be educated in religious or traditional values. Neutral on this.

17:08.960 --> 17:14.800
Neutral. Maybe even disagree. It's up to them. It's up to the kids to figure out where they

17:14.800 --> 17:20.880
want to go in their lives, you know? So, let's just choose neutral. Traditions are of no value

17:20.880 --> 17:25.680
on their own. Absolutely not. And I'm not even a traditionalist, but they obviously have some

17:25.680 --> 17:31.040
value. There's obviously something that is more than the sum of its parts holding cultures

17:31.040 --> 17:36.720
together. And even though it's important to challenge traditions, even though it's important

17:36.720 --> 17:41.280
to discard traditions when necessary, when they've become tyrannical or they've become oppressive,

17:41.280 --> 17:46.160
even when it's important to change traditions or introduce new ones, the tradition itself still

17:46.160 --> 17:51.680
has some value. So, I disagree. Religion should play a role in government. No, it should not.

17:51.680 --> 17:58.400
Strongly disagree. Churches should be taxed the same way that other institutions are taxed. Yeah,

17:58.400 --> 18:01.360
I don't see why not, you know? If money changes hands, it should be taxed.

18:01.360 --> 18:06.720
Climate change is currently one of the greatest threats to our way of life.

18:06.720 --> 18:12.640
See, I don't think it is. I think climate change is real, but I think the great ecological

18:12.640 --> 18:16.960
disaster of our time is not even climate change. It's plastic in the oceans. That's a very different

18:16.960 --> 18:22.320
problem. Climate change is small potatoes compared to plastic in the oceans. So, I'm kind of neutral

18:22.320 --> 18:28.320
on this. I mean, it's not. No, I guess I disagree. It is not. It is a threat, but it is not nearly

18:28.320 --> 18:34.960
one of the greatest threats. It is important that we work as a united world to combat climate change.

18:34.960 --> 18:39.360
Now, this I can actually agree with because even though climate change is not one of the greatest

18:39.360 --> 18:44.560
threats, it is still somewhat of a threat and it will take everyone getting involved in order to

18:44.560 --> 18:49.280
fix the problem. You know, Canada and the US and Europe and all these other places, they can do

18:49.280 --> 18:53.440
their part, but if China and India just don't give a shit, the problem is not going to get fixed.

18:53.440 --> 19:00.880
In fact, like, Canada outputs what, like one, two percent of the entire world's emissions?

19:00.880 --> 19:05.840
We can't do shit. All of our politicians over here in Canada, they're like, we go to solve the

19:05.840 --> 19:10.320
crisis. No, we can't do anything, dude. We're a small player in this regard. We can't do shit,

19:11.520 --> 19:16.640
but I agree. Society was better many years ago than it is now. I strongly disagree.

19:16.640 --> 19:21.040
There is no time other than this era, you know, the modern era, the internet era, that I would

19:21.040 --> 19:25.200
rather have been alive. This is great, man. All things considered, things are getting better for

19:25.200 --> 19:30.160
everyone at a pace we've never seen before. We literally live in a golden age of everything.

19:30.160 --> 19:35.440
This is amazing. It is important that we maintain the traditions of our past. Yeah,

19:35.440 --> 19:40.240
like a little bit, sure. Like, I don't agree with all traditions. However, it is people's

19:40.240 --> 19:47.760
freedom to do so. And also, they're not all bad, you know, so agree. It is important that we think

19:47.760 --> 19:51.840
in the long term beyond our lifespans. Yes, I also agree with this. There are things that need

19:51.840 --> 19:54.800
to be done that we won't actually see the fruits of, you know, at some point, we're going to have

19:54.800 --> 19:59.840
to go to the stars and you and I won't see that. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't at least, you

19:59.840 --> 20:07.280
know, put a few bricks in that wall. You know, let's agree. Reason is more important than

20:07.280 --> 20:13.280
maintaining our culture. Yeah, I'm neutral on that one. Partially because our culture is reason,

20:13.280 --> 20:19.120
but also partially because, like, you can't simply have your culture. You can't simply

20:19.120 --> 20:26.000
have your traditions because they're old, they're stale. Sometimes they don't understand what's

20:26.000 --> 20:31.120
going on. But reason, you know, the world of pure reason where there's no spiritual side to life,

20:31.680 --> 20:36.960
that can be equally destructive. So I am neutral on this because I think they're equally as

20:36.960 --> 20:42.320
important. Drug use should be legalized or decriminalized. Strongly agree. Absolutely.

20:42.320 --> 20:46.800
People should be able to do whatever they want. Within reason, obviously. Same sex marriage should

20:46.800 --> 20:50.400
be legal. Yes, of course. The state has no business manning this either. Strongly agree.

20:50.400 --> 20:54.960
It's a human rights issue. No cultures are superior to others. Strongly disagree.

20:57.280 --> 21:02.080
Backwards ass Islamic shitholes are objectively inferior to Western culture.

21:03.680 --> 21:08.720
Sex outside marriage is immoral. Strongly disagree. People can do whatever the fuck

21:08.720 --> 21:14.400
they want, man. Like this is their freedom. If we accept migrants at all, it is important

21:14.400 --> 21:19.760
that they assimilate into our culture. Strongly agree with this one. Of course. Again, if they're

21:19.760 --> 21:24.560
coming from shitholes and they want to come here to be Canadians, they are welcome to come here to

21:24.560 --> 21:31.840
be Canadians, but they have to become Canadians. Abortions should be prohibited in most or all

21:31.840 --> 21:37.200
cases. Strongly disagree. Gun ownership should be prohibited for those without a valid reason.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.720
Again, strongly disagree. This is that personal freedom thing coming through.

21:44.000 --> 21:51.200
I support single-payer universal healthcare. Yeah. Prostitution should be illegal. Strongly

21:51.200 --> 21:56.480
disagree as well. Do whatever you want. This is the libertarian in me coming out. Do whatever

21:56.480 --> 22:00.800
you want as long as you're not hurting somebody else. The government should have no say. That's

22:00.800 --> 22:04.640
not me saying that I think those things are good, but it is me saying that the government

22:04.640 --> 22:12.960
shouldn't stop you. Maintaining family values is essential. Yeah, I actually agree. It is.

22:12.960 --> 22:16.240
If you're raising a family, there should be some family values there. You can't just like,

22:16.240 --> 22:21.200
you know, mistreat your kids or something. I know that the feminists like to say that

22:21.200 --> 22:25.680
the nuclear family is oppressive, but it really isn't. And the destruction of the

22:25.680 --> 22:30.240
nuclear family has kind of harmed the black community in multi-generational ways. So let's

22:30.240 --> 22:37.200
go with agree here. Chase progress at all costs is dangerous. I agree as well. Because like,

22:38.320 --> 22:45.200
most people who say that they're progressives, they like, they do some weird fucking shit and

22:45.200 --> 22:49.600
they believe some weird things in the name of progress, man. And they think that what

22:49.600 --> 22:54.320
they're chasing is progress, but it's not like, that's the thing. When you chase progress,

22:54.320 --> 22:59.360
you often don't get it. You often just overshoot the mark and fucking destroy everything.

23:00.400 --> 23:06.480
The idea is not to chase progress. The idea is to run away from destruction and through

23:06.480 --> 23:10.560
process of elimination, you'll get there eventually. It's the difference between

23:11.840 --> 23:17.520
doing good and not doing evil. There's a pretty big difference there. So I agree with the statement.

23:18.640 --> 23:24.240
Genetic modification is a force for good, even on humans. Yeah. I mean, I don't mind the whole

23:24.240 --> 23:28.640
designer babies thing. It might be weird in the future, but like, I don't mind the idea of

23:28.720 --> 23:33.760
tinkering with genes once the process becomes reliable to make the species better. I don't

23:33.760 --> 23:41.280
care about that at all. I'm like, I'm neutral on it in that I don't care, but I agree with it

23:41.280 --> 23:48.480
in that if it works, it's like, yes, sure. Okay, sure. We should open our borders to immigration.

23:48.480 --> 23:55.440
I mean, yes, but not to the levels that we're currently opening them to. So like, I agree,

23:55.440 --> 24:00.480
but I don't strongly agree. Governments should be as concerned about foreigners as they are

24:00.480 --> 24:08.240
about their own citizens. I mean, I fluctuate between neutral and disagree because unless it's

24:09.440 --> 24:14.160
some kind of Holocaust happening, like China genociding the Uyghurs or something,

24:14.160 --> 24:19.360
unless that's going on, I don't think our government has any business in anybody else's

24:19.360 --> 24:24.880
affairs. It's their affairs. If the people elected that other government and that other government

24:24.880 --> 24:30.080
is doing what the people want, and they're not like wholesale butchering a population,

24:31.040 --> 24:33.520
then I don't think you have a place to say anything, you know?

24:36.000 --> 24:40.720
So like, I mean, here, should be as concerned? No, no.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.600
This is hard. I don't know.

24:45.600 --> 24:56.720
I'll choose disagree just because it's that one extreme situation where I agree with this,

24:56.720 --> 25:01.440
so I'll just choose disagree. All people, regardless of factors like culture, sexuality

25:01.440 --> 25:06.480
should be treated equally. Yes, always. Treat people as individuals. Do not simply judge them

25:06.480 --> 25:12.880
by their culture. It is important that we further my group's goals above all others. No, no. I mean,

25:13.600 --> 25:16.400
it first of all, this is a very vague statement, but like,

25:16.400 --> 25:20.080
generally no, like my group is humanity in a sense.

25:23.280 --> 25:30.080
Here we go. Check it out. Centrist economic access. This is I'm slightly more markets than

25:30.080 --> 25:38.960
equality. Okay. Diplomatic access to balanced. I am 60 nation, 40 world. Okay. Civil access,

25:38.960 --> 25:44.640
moderate. I am 60 Liberty, 40 authority. All right. Societal access, progressive.

25:45.200 --> 25:52.480
I am 40% tradition, 60% progress liberalism. Now I've done this before.

25:53.680 --> 26:00.400
And last time I did it, I got centrism. I have fluctuated between centrism, liberalism,

26:00.400 --> 26:06.720
and libertarianism. And they all look kind of like this. You know, it's generally a 60,

26:06.720 --> 26:14.320
40 split with markets coming in over a quality nation coming in over world Liberty coming in

26:14.320 --> 26:19.280
over authority and progress coming in over tradition. It's generally a 60, 40 split though

26:19.280 --> 26:26.480
with each one, which means that it's not like I'm massively nation over world. It's only that

26:26.480 --> 26:31.680
it's usually a 60, 40 split. So yeah, I am a liberal. Now I know that you can get like,

26:32.320 --> 26:35.200
you can get like centrist here. You can get libertarian here.

26:35.200 --> 26:39.920
You can even get neoliberal here, but I didn't get, I've never gotten neoliberal.

26:39.920 --> 26:47.200
This is liberalism. So there are a lot of people out there who call me a Nazi, a fascist,

26:48.400 --> 26:54.240
an alt-right shud, a reactionary. No, I'm just a liberal. I've always been a liberal.

26:54.240 --> 26:59.840
This is very close to what I got five years ago. It is very close to what I got 10 years ago.

26:59.920 --> 27:06.400
I have always only been a liberal. Thanks for coming along with me on this ride guys. It was

27:07.360 --> 27:11.760
a lot of fun. Real videos coming back tomorrow. I know there's been a drought recently. I'm sorry.

27:12.880 --> 27:17.760
I am working on the Kyle Rittenhouse video. It's just that it's a deep dive. All right. It's

27:17.760 --> 27:20.640
coming, but it's going to be one of those big videos. It's going to be like Chaz. It's going

27:20.640 --> 27:26.240
to be a big situation. So it's coming, but you will see it later. I have two dumping with scrumps

27:26.480 --> 27:30.480
that I've recorded that haven't put out yet. Those will come out soon. But yeah,

27:30.480 --> 27:34.880
videos are coming back. Thanks very much. Oh, and also I'm streaming pretty much right when

27:34.880 --> 27:39.440
you see this, I'll be streaming on Twitch. So drop by and say hi there. I will see you

27:39.440 --> 27:44.960
for tomorrow's video or for tonight's stream. Thanks for watching guys. I love you.
