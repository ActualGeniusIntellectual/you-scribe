1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Hey buddies, I realized that I haven't actually done one of these political compass tests before.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,240
You'd think I would have over the years, but I don't think I did. At least not on a video.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,960
So, because this test recently remade the rounds on Twitter for some reason that I don't know,

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,560
I literally just retook this. I'm exactly where I was in 2015. And in 2010,

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,960
my politics haven't really changed. Actually, it turns out, when I took it in 2015,

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,840
this red dot was actually one square to the left. So I guess I've shifted just slightly leftward

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,160
over time, but I've always been about this far down. I mean, these tests change every time you

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,640
take them, right? Sometimes you hover around this area if you're me. I've been a bit further down

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,040
the libertarian scale before. I've been a bit further right and further left, but I've always

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,920
been around here, so I'm not surprised. And I've always been there. I was there in 2010,

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,440
I was there in 2015, I'm there in 2020. But yeah, my politics haven't changed. What's changed is

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,000
that people didn't used to call me a fascist back in 2010 for existing down here. Now the common

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,600
belief is that if you're not getting more left over time, you might as well be in the blue

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,160
square. And that's the case. That's the case. If you exist here or you exist anywhere in here,

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
people who are like on this final edge here, these final two columns,

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,800
they treat you like you're up here. It's kind of ridiculous. But this test isn't the greatest.

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,560
So I figure it might be worth doing the eight axis and just kind of going over it, right? You know,

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,720
why not? Why not? We all know about this, right? Equality versus markets, nation versus world,

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,200
liberty versus authority, and tradition versus progress. Those are the four axes, economic,

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,360
diplomatic, civil, and societal. Let's do it. You will be presented with a series of statements.

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,720
For each one, click the button with your opinion on it. Okay. Oppression by corporations is

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,000
more of a concern than oppression by governments. I disagree. And the main reason that I disagree

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,960
is because of the government's monopoly on violence, on the legitimate use of force.

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,920
A corporation can't simply kill you. The government can if it's tyrannical.

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,080
That's the difference. That's not to say that I don't think corporate oppression isn't real. It

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,440
very clearly is. It is a serious problem. It needs to be dealt with. However, I think that government

27
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,720
oppression has more of a capability to be destructive. So I will just slightly disagree.

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,640
It is necessary for the government to intervene in the economy to protect consumers. I slightly

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,520
agree with this. Yes, only slightly. And it's because there are areas in which there are

30
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,640
natural monopolies. And if that's the case and competition won't actually help the service

31
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,800
become higher quality, then the government does have some kind of a mandate there to step in and

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,080
make sure that people have access to the service fairly. However, most monopolies are created by

33
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,400
the government, but in those few cases where monopolies aren't created by the government,

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,360
then the government actually has a mandate to get in there. So yeah, I agree.

35
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,560
The fear of the market is the fear of the people. Absolutely. Absolutely. Because you can just

36
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,960
choose what you want to do with your time, your money, your energy, your labor. You can just

37
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,640
choose, you know, choose in the market what you want to do. Yes. It is better to maintain a

38
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,960
balanced budget than to ensure welfare for all citizens. Now, while welfare for citizens is

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,680
obviously good, that's generally left to the individual to create for themselves. So I think

40
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,880
for the government, it is better to maintain a balanced budget. So I'm going to like slightly

41
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:39,280
agree. Publicly funded research is more beneficial to the people than leaving it to the market. I'm

42
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,720
neutral. I'm neutral on this because I think research, no matter where it comes from,

43
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,400
is at least a tool. There's obviously biased research. There's obviously lots of problems

44
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,920
with research. We've seen the scandals coming into the academic sphere recently where, you know,

45
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,520
studies are kind of falsified and people can't recreate them and this and that. But I think if

46
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,680
the research is good, it doesn't matter where it comes from. So neutral. Terrorists on international

47
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,520
trade are important to encourage local production. I slightly agree. Yes. Especially because we're

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,480
dealing with someone like China who has no problem just destroying their own population in a race to

49
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,840
outdo the United States and eventually overtake them. So yes, slightly agree. Reach according

50
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,720
to his ability to each according to his needs. Strongly disagree because I'm not a fucking

51
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,960
Marxist. It would be best if social programs were abolished in favor of private charity.

52
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,920
This is a hard one because social programs do a lot of good when they're properly implemented

53
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,200
and they're not corrupt and things are going fine. However, private charity is often more

54
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,920
efficient at what it's trying to do. So should we abolish social programs? No.

55
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,160
Are private charities better at what they do? Generally, yes. So I guess I'm neutral on that.

56
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,960
Taxes should be increased on the rich to provide for the poor.

57
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,560
Um, I mean, yes, but only to a certain extent. There's definitely an argument to be made that,

58
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,200
like, you should tax people who are extraordinarily wealthy and fund, you know,

59
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,280
a basic healthcare system. That's reasonable. Canada does it. The UK does it. It hasn't

60
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,400
destroyed our countries yet. And a shitty healthcare service like the one that Canada has

61
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,280
is better than having no healthcare service and going into debt for millions of dollars over

62
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,200
something, you know, that frankly you shouldn't be going into debt over. Like if, if you're born

63
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,360
with a pre-existing condition and you're just fucked, you know, why should you be owing millions

64
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,280
of dollars? Like it's, it's, it seems a bit unfair. So I, I agree. I don't strongly agree,

65
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,320
but I agree. Inheritance is a legitimate form of wealth. Absolutely. Strongly agree.

66
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,320
Because when you own property, um, it is your right to do, to do whatever you want with it,

67
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,080
including gift it. If you want to gift it to anybody you want, including your kids,

68
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,800
that is legitimate. So I strongly agree. Basic utilities like roads and electricity should be

69
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,880
publicly owned. Um, yeah, I pretty much agree with that too. It was one of those things that

70
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,120
the entire community needs. And there's probably some mandate there to ensure that every citizen

71
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,200
has some kind of fair access to the service. So yeah. Government intervention is a threat

72
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,880
to the economy. I do agree actually quite a bit. Um, again, there are a few tiny instances

73
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,640
where the government intervention might actually save something, but for the most part governments

74
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,600
tend to fuck up economy. So I agree. Those with a greater ability to pay should receive better

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,640
healthcare. Yes. Yes. I do agree for, for a minimum standard of care for those people who,

76
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,480
who can't afford it, but there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to pay for something better,

77
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,040
just like private schools. You know, quality education is a right of all people. And now I

78
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,560
know what they mean by this. They're thinking that if you hit disagree, then you think you don't

79
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,960
believe that people deserve to have a quality education. Um, it's not what I believe at all.

80
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
I actually do believe that people should have a quality education, but it's not a right.

81
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,680
Rights are very specific things. Rights are things that they're basically infinite in supply.

82
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,640
They can only be taken away from you. They can't be given to you. So quality education is a good

83
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,520
thing and a developed country should be spending a lot of money on its education where necessary,

84
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,320
but is it a right? No. So I will have to slightly disagree. The means of production should belong

85
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,560
to the workers who use them. No, it should belong to the people who made them or bought them. This

86
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,120
is more common bullshit. United nations should be abolished. This is one of the things that I

87
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,440
actually swung on quite a bit in the past five to 10 years. I would, I would have said strongly

88
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,920
disagreed before. Now I agree. Um, and it's mainly because, have you seen the amount of

89
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,800
corrupt shit coming out of the United nations recently? It's kind of wild. Military action

90
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,480
by our nation is often necessary to protect it. Yes, of course. Like any nation can say yes for

91
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,600
this. I support regional unions, such as the European union. Now the thing with regional

92
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,080
unions is that sometimes they're just like trading blocks, which are generally fine.

93
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,560
Sometimes they're military alliances, which are generally fine. The EU, however, is this

94
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,920
neo-lib nightmare proto state that's desperately trying to basically turn all of the countries

95
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,600
into it, into, um, like vassal States. So I disagree with their example of the, of the EU,

96
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,080
but I do believe that regional unions can often be okay. So I'm going to go neutral on it.

97
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,560
It is important to maintain our national sovereignty. Yes, of course it is.

98
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,760
United world government would be beneficial to mankind. No, it would not. It would not because

99
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,880
it's devolution of powers that make societies more free. Like if you're voting for somebody

100
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,920
who lives half a world away, they're not going to give a shit about you. If you're voting for

101
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,600
somebody where the power structure is closer to where you live and is a little bit more,

102
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,200
it's a little bit smaller and therefore it's a little bit more local. It is more likely that

103
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,000
that your needs will be represented by that structure. So strongly disagree.

104
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,680
It is more important to maintain peaceful relations and to further our strength. I think

105
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,320
those are probably equal. You know, you should be strong in case you have to fight, but if you can

106
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,520
opt for peace, then you should opt for peace. So I think I'm going to go neutral on that.

107
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,160
Wars do not need to be justified in other countries. Yeah, I agree with that.

108
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,000
If you have to go to war, it's nobody else's business. You know, some third party who's not

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,360
taking any side, they're like, you shouldn't do that. It's like, no, no, maybe there's a reason

110
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,160
you're going to war. Maybe there's a good reason. In fact, so no, I agree with this.

111
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,080
Military spending is a waste of money. I strongly disagree. We live in a world where, and again,

112
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,120
this isn't something that I've probably changed on over the past 10 years, but we live in a world

113
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,680
with a resurgent China. China is fucking everyone everywhere and we need a deterrent, frankly.

114
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,680
The West needs to basically grow a backbone and stand up to them. So strongly disagree.

115
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,720
International aid is a waste of money. I disagree as well. There are definitely times when like

116
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,600
international aid kind of goes to the wrong, goes into the wrong pockets. You know, a little bit

117
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,760
corrupt. People skim a bit too much off the top. Stuff doesn't go to where it's supposed to go,

118
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,880
but when it works, it's obviously good. You know, charity is obviously good.

119
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,200
My nation is great. Yeah, I agree with that. Canada is objectively one of the better nations

120
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,800
in the world. Like there's, there's no comparing us to, you know, some Islamic shithole that

121
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,480
mistreats gay people, mistreats women, you know? No. Yeah. Canada is pretty great. Research should

122
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,000
be conducted on an international scale. I agree with that. You know, generally like it should be

123
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
basically if it's something that's important, like space research or like coronavirus research

124
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,480
or something, generally you have multiple space agencies working together for multiple countries.

125
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,560
You have private and public businesses all working together. Like for the coronavirus vaccine,

126
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,440
you know, the Americans, the Canadians, the Brits, the French, and the Germans,

127
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,600
they're all working together on it. Like they all have their own projects, but they're sharing their

128
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,040
research. And I think that is kind of how you get things done if you really need to get things done.

129
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,440
So yeah, I agree. Governments should be accountable to the international community.

130
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:39,440
I mean, yes and no. Again, like if a government is blatantly violating the human rights of its

131
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,120
citizens, yes. But there are definitely instances where other other countries are just like meddling

132
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,840
and it's like, well, fuck off dude. Like you're not part of this. So I'm going to go neutral

133
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,480
because there are times when this statement is true and times when it's false. So neutral.

134
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,840
Even when protesting an authoritarian government, violence is not acceptable.

135
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,600
Yeah. No. Like if you're fighting a legitimate authoritarian government and you have to actually,

136
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,440
you know, engage in a civil war, then no, like there are times where you have to use violence

137
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,120
against authoritarians, but you have to be measured with it. You have to understand like,

138
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,760
okay, you're, you are now violating the social contract because you believe that your government

139
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,640
is just too authoritarian to, um, to tolerate anymore. And that might be the case, but when

140
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,800
it comes to like the Antifa fucks, they believe that that's the case. And yet it very clearly

141
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,840
isn't. So you have to like, one, you have to win because if you don't win, you're gonna get fucked.

142
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:41,200
But two, you also have to understand exactly what you're doing. So I disagree, but

143
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,280
there's like, this is a hard one. This is actually really hard. I don't know if I'm neutral or

144
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,640
disagree. I don't know. I'll hit disagree. My religious values should be spread as much as

145
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,360
possible. Um, no, I don't. I mean, I'm an atheist, right? So it doesn't, doesn't really matter. I

146
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,720
don't really have those values. If you want to spread atheism, like go ahead. But I actually

147
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,400
don't, don't really care as long as people aren't hurting anybody. I don't care what they believe.

148
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,120
Our nation's value is very much possible. Yes, because our values are capitalism and liberalism

149
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,360
and democracy. It doesn't matter whether that's parliamentary democracy or whether it's, you know,

150
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,760
Republican democracy, but either way, yeah, we, we live in objectively the best civilizations on

151
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,560
earth right now. It should be spread. It is very important to maintain law and order. Yeah,

152
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,960
generally. Yeah, I agree. I guess I should probably explain that one, right? Sorry. I jumped

153
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,160
ahead too quickly. Um, yeah, like there are definitely times when you have to, when you have

154
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,560
to fight, fight the power. For the most part, democracy is still getting things done. So no,

155
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,040
the general populace makes poor decisions. I'm neutral on this, frankly, because you have some

156
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,320
really dumb fucking people out there who are in positions of power and you have some really

157
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,920
smart people who are kind of, you know, stuck in a hole and can't really do anything because of the

158
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,280
circumstances of their life. Then you also have some dumb people who put themselves there and

159
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,360
then you have some smart people who are where they should be. So like the general populace

160
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,600
is an entire range of people who are very smart and very dumb. So sometimes they make

161
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,560
poor decisions and sometimes they don't. I'm just going to go neutral. Physician assisted suicide

162
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,120
should be legal. Yes. I strongly agree with that. Well, here's the thing, like I strongly agree,

163
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,040
but there's also potential for it to be abused. So there has to be like something there to make

164
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,160
sure it's not abused, but I still strongly agree. Yeah. The sacrifice of some civil liberties is

165
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,440
necessary to protect us from acts of terrorism. No, fuck you NSA. I strongly disagree. Government

166
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,400
surveillance is necessary in the modern world. No, fuck you NSA. I strongly disagree. The very

167
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,760
existence of the state is a threat to our liberty. No, I strongly disagree. The state

168
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,240
should be restrained because its power is, is incredible. And if it's turned on its own people,

169
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,360
that's disastrous, but you still need the state. You still need some kind of apparatus there

170
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,440
to make sure that your rights aren't violated and that something can happen to those people who

171
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,880
violate other people's rights. So, you know, if something, you know, someone steals your purse

172
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,720
on the street and then the cops, you know, the cop who's around the corner sees it, chases after

173
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,680
the robber and like tackles him and then, you know, handcuffs him and takes him away. That is

174
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,480
unprovoked force by the officer, but it's still necessary because that is basically the state

175
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,600
attempting to rectify the violation of your rights. Therefore you need a state. You need

176
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,680
some kind of night watchman. So I disagree. Regardless of political opinions, it is

177
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,160
important to side with your country. I'm neutral on this. You know, there are times in your country

178
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,640
does legitimately evil things and you can't side with it, but then there are times when

179
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,760
your differences are minor and it's time to act because there's a greater evil out there

180
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,520
and you have to kind of go along with it. So I'm neutral. Yeah, I'm neutral.

181
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,240
All authority should be questioned. Yes, of course. Of course it should be.

182
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:07,120
Okay. Hierarchical state is best. Not only is it best, it's the only type of state that can exist.

183
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:14,720
Like, no, you don't get your stateless society. You don't get your classless,

184
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,120
you know, governmentless society where everyone just lives in a commune. No, it doesn't exist.

185
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,120
It will never work. We are social creatures. Therefore, we trend toward organization.

186
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,000
Strongly agree. It is important that the government follows the majority opinion,

187
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,880
even if it's wrong. No, the government should not. The government can basically hold a vote

188
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,280
and then the majority can vote to exterminate a minority population. And then the government

189
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,280
should follow that. No, there has to be restraint on government power. We cannot simply bend to the

190
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,520
tyranny of the majority in a democracy. Democracy is important, but it's not the only part. And

191
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,520
there's a reason why it's not the only part. So, I disagree. The stronger the leadership,

192
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,600
the better. I'm neutral in this because, you know, you have strong men who are very clearly just

193
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,240
fascists taking over and then you have strong leadership that is needed but is still legitimate.

194
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,200
So, neutral. Democracy is more than a decision-making process.

195
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,920
I would generally agree with that because it's also representation, isn't it? Like,

196
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,440
you elect people to make decisions in parliament or whatever, but it's not just that. Yeah,

197
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,680
agree. Environmental regulations are essential. I agree. I actually do agree with this.

198
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,040
I think the free market argument falls flat when it comes to the environment because if you have,

199
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,240
say, a company that just dumps a bunch of radioactive waste into the river and then,

200
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,440
you know, downriver an entire town dies. Yeah, the free market will fix that because that company

201
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,920
will go out of business since everyone hates them for killing a town, but we can get to that point

202
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,160
with the people in the town dying, right? Like, there are some things government can do and I

203
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,240
think environmental regulation is one of them. So, I agree. A better world will come from automation,

204
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,400
science, technology. I strongly agree, actually. I think our future is pretty bright, all things

205
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,960
considered. Children should be educated in religious or traditional values. Neutral on this.

206
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,800
Neutral. Maybe even disagree. It's up to them. It's up to the kids to figure out where they

207
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,880
want to go in their lives, you know? So, let's just choose neutral. Traditions are of no value

208
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,680
on their own. Absolutely not. And I'm not even a traditionalist, but they obviously have some

209
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,040
value. There's obviously something that is more than the sum of its parts holding cultures

210
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,720
together. And even though it's important to challenge traditions, even though it's important

211
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,280
to discard traditions when necessary, when they've become tyrannical or they've become oppressive,

212
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,160
even when it's important to change traditions or introduce new ones, the tradition itself still

213
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,680
has some value. So, I disagree. Religion should play a role in government. No, it should not.

214
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:58,400
Strongly disagree. Churches should be taxed the same way that other institutions are taxed. Yeah,

215
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,360
I don't see why not, you know? If money changes hands, it should be taxed.

216
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,720
Climate change is currently one of the greatest threats to our way of life.

217
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,640
See, I don't think it is. I think climate change is real, but I think the great ecological

218
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,960
disaster of our time is not even climate change. It's plastic in the oceans. That's a very different

219
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,320
problem. Climate change is small potatoes compared to plastic in the oceans. So, I'm kind of neutral

220
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,320
on this. I mean, it's not. No, I guess I disagree. It is not. It is a threat, but it is not nearly

221
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,960
one of the greatest threats. It is important that we work as a united world to combat climate change.

222
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,360
Now, this I can actually agree with because even though climate change is not one of the greatest

223
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,560
threats, it is still somewhat of a threat and it will take everyone getting involved in order to

224
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:49,280
fix the problem. You know, Canada and the US and Europe and all these other places, they can do

225
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,440
their part, but if China and India just don't give a shit, the problem is not going to get fixed.

226
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,880
In fact, like, Canada outputs what, like one, two percent of the entire world's emissions?

227
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,840
We can't do shit. All of our politicians over here in Canada, they're like, we go to solve the

228
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,320
crisis. No, we can't do anything, dude. We're a small player in this regard. We can't do shit,

229
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,640
but I agree. Society was better many years ago than it is now. I strongly disagree.

230
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,040
There is no time other than this era, you know, the modern era, the internet era, that I would

231
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,200
rather have been alive. This is great, man. All things considered, things are getting better for

232
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,160
everyone at a pace we've never seen before. We literally live in a golden age of everything.

233
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,440
This is amazing. It is important that we maintain the traditions of our past. Yeah,

234
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,240
like a little bit, sure. Like, I don't agree with all traditions. However, it is people's

235
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:47,760
freedom to do so. And also, they're not all bad, you know, so agree. It is important that we think

236
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,840
in the long term beyond our lifespans. Yes, I also agree with this. There are things that need

237
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,800
to be done that we won't actually see the fruits of, you know, at some point, we're going to have

238
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,840
to go to the stars and you and I won't see that. But it doesn't mean we shouldn't at least, you

239
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,280
know, put a few bricks in that wall. You know, let's agree. Reason is more important than

240
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,280
maintaining our culture. Yeah, I'm neutral on that one. Partially because our culture is reason,

241
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,120
but also partially because, like, you can't simply have your culture. You can't simply

242
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:26,000
have your traditions because they're old, they're stale. Sometimes they don't understand what's

243
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,120
going on. But reason, you know, the world of pure reason where there's no spiritual side to life,

244
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,960
that can be equally destructive. So I am neutral on this because I think they're equally as

245
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,320
important. Drug use should be legalized or decriminalized. Strongly agree. Absolutely.

246
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,800
People should be able to do whatever they want. Within reason, obviously. Same sex marriage should

247
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,400
be legal. Yes, of course. The state has no business manning this either. Strongly agree.

248
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,960
It's a human rights issue. No cultures are superior to others. Strongly disagree.

249
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,080
Backwards ass Islamic shitholes are objectively inferior to Western culture.

250
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,720
Sex outside marriage is immoral. Strongly disagree. People can do whatever the fuck

251
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,400
they want, man. Like this is their freedom. If we accept migrants at all, it is important

252
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,760
that they assimilate into our culture. Strongly agree with this one. Of course. Again, if they're

253
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,560
coming from shitholes and they want to come here to be Canadians, they are welcome to come here to

254
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:31,840
be Canadians, but they have to become Canadians. Abortions should be prohibited in most or all

255
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,200
cases. Strongly disagree. Gun ownership should be prohibited for those without a valid reason.

256
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,720
Again, strongly disagree. This is that personal freedom thing coming through.

257
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,200
I support single-payer universal healthcare. Yeah. Prostitution should be illegal. Strongly

258
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,480
disagree as well. Do whatever you want. This is the libertarian in me coming out. Do whatever

259
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,800
you want as long as you're not hurting somebody else. The government should have no say. That's

260
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,640
not me saying that I think those things are good, but it is me saying that the government

261
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:12,960
shouldn't stop you. Maintaining family values is essential. Yeah, I actually agree. It is.

262
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,240
If you're raising a family, there should be some family values there. You can't just like,

263
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,200
you know, mistreat your kids or something. I know that the feminists like to say that

264
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,680
the nuclear family is oppressive, but it really isn't. And the destruction of the

265
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,240
nuclear family has kind of harmed the black community in multi-generational ways. So let's

266
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,200
go with agree here. Chase progress at all costs is dangerous. I agree as well. Because like,

267
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,200
most people who say that they're progressives, they like, they do some weird fucking shit and

268
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,600
they believe some weird things in the name of progress, man. And they think that what

269
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,320
they're chasing is progress, but it's not like, that's the thing. When you chase progress,

270
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,360
you often don't get it. You often just overshoot the mark and fucking destroy everything.

271
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,480
The idea is not to chase progress. The idea is to run away from destruction and through

272
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,560
process of elimination, you'll get there eventually. It's the difference between

273
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,520
doing good and not doing evil. There's a pretty big difference there. So I agree with the statement.

274
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,240
Genetic modification is a force for good, even on humans. Yeah. I mean, I don't mind the whole

275
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,640
designer babies thing. It might be weird in the future, but like, I don't mind the idea of

276
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,760
tinkering with genes once the process becomes reliable to make the species better. I don't

277
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:41,280
care about that at all. I'm like, I'm neutral on it in that I don't care, but I agree with it

278
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:48,480
in that if it works, it's like, yes, sure. Okay, sure. We should open our borders to immigration.

279
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:55,440
I mean, yes, but not to the levels that we're currently opening them to. So like, I agree,

280
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,480
but I don't strongly agree. Governments should be as concerned about foreigners as they are

281
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:08,240
about their own citizens. I mean, I fluctuate between neutral and disagree because unless it's

282
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,160
some kind of Holocaust happening, like China genociding the Uyghurs or something,

283
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,360
unless that's going on, I don't think our government has any business in anybody else's

284
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,880
affairs. It's their affairs. If the people elected that other government and that other government

285
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,080
is doing what the people want, and they're not like wholesale butchering a population,

286
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,520
then I don't think you have a place to say anything, you know?

287
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,720
So like, I mean, here, should be as concerned? No, no.

288
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
This is hard. I don't know.

289
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:56,720
I'll choose disagree just because it's that one extreme situation where I agree with this,

290
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,440
so I'll just choose disagree. All people, regardless of factors like culture, sexuality

291
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,480
should be treated equally. Yes, always. Treat people as individuals. Do not simply judge them

292
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,880
by their culture. It is important that we further my group's goals above all others. No, no. I mean,

293
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,400
it first of all, this is a very vague statement, but like,

294
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,080
generally no, like my group is humanity in a sense.

295
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:30,080
Here we go. Check it out. Centrist economic access. This is I'm slightly more markets than

296
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:38,960
equality. Okay. Diplomatic access to balanced. I am 60 nation, 40 world. Okay. Civil access,

297
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,640
moderate. I am 60 Liberty, 40 authority. All right. Societal access, progressive.

298
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:52,480
I am 40% tradition, 60% progress liberalism. Now I've done this before.

299
00:25:53,680 --> 00:26:00,400
And last time I did it, I got centrism. I have fluctuated between centrism, liberalism,

300
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,720
and libertarianism. And they all look kind of like this. You know, it's generally a 60,

301
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:14,320
40 split with markets coming in over a quality nation coming in over world Liberty coming in

302
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,280
over authority and progress coming in over tradition. It's generally a 60, 40 split though

303
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:26,480
with each one, which means that it's not like I'm massively nation over world. It's only that

304
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,680
it's usually a 60, 40 split. So yeah, I am a liberal. Now I know that you can get like,

305
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,200
you can get like centrist here. You can get libertarian here.

306
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,920
You can even get neoliberal here, but I didn't get, I've never gotten neoliberal.

307
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:47,200
This is liberalism. So there are a lot of people out there who call me a Nazi, a fascist,

308
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,240
an alt-right shud, a reactionary. No, I'm just a liberal. I've always been a liberal.

309
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,840
This is very close to what I got five years ago. It is very close to what I got 10 years ago.

310
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:06,400
I have always only been a liberal. Thanks for coming along with me on this ride guys. It was

311
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,760
a lot of fun. Real videos coming back tomorrow. I know there's been a drought recently. I'm sorry.

312
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,760
I am working on the Kyle Rittenhouse video. It's just that it's a deep dive. All right. It's

313
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,640
coming, but it's going to be one of those big videos. It's going to be like Chaz. It's going

314
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:26,240
to be a big situation. So it's coming, but you will see it later. I have two dumping with scrumps

315
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,480
that I've recorded that haven't put out yet. Those will come out soon. But yeah,

316
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,880
videos are coming back. Thanks very much. Oh, and also I'm streaming pretty much right when

317
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,440
you see this, I'll be streaming on Twitch. So drop by and say hi there. I will see you

318
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,960
for tomorrow's video or for tonight's stream. Thanks for watching guys. I love you.
