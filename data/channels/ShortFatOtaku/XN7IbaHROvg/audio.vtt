00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
This video is not meant to be a statement of absolute fact, nor does it exist to directly

00:04.640 --> 00:06.160
accuse anybody of anything.

00:06.160 --> 00:09.600
Rather, it's a presentation of the evidence that we've discovered and an open call for

00:09.600 --> 00:13.840
others on both the inside and out to discuss the issues explored therein.

00:13.840 --> 00:18.760
Furthermore, any audio accompanied by the Devon no-talent gaming artwork can be considered

00:18.760 --> 00:21.740
to be entirely our own opinion or conjecture on a topic.

00:21.740 --> 00:22.620
Thank you and enjoy!

00:30.000 --> 00:41.320
Sorry for the hideously late video, buddies, but the subject matter ended up taking a lot

00:41.320 --> 00:43.440
longer to investigate than we thought.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.880
Recently, something stupid happened on Twitter.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.000
Shocking, right?

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
Jay Allen, aka a man in black, tweeted, Shigeru Miyamoto was hired because of nepotism.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.680
And then later, seriously, Shigeru Miyamoto got a job at Nintendo because his father knew

00:57.680 --> 00:58.680
somebody there.

00:58.680 --> 01:03.960
Thankfully, many people saw exactly how retarded Jay Allen was being, and the internet gave

01:03.960 --> 01:06.520
him the lashing he so rightly deserved.

01:06.520 --> 01:10.520
Margaret Jell posted a passage regarding Jay Allen's stupidity, which I'll summarize here

01:10.520 --> 01:11.520
quickly.

01:11.520 --> 01:15.820
Some indie devs and social justice warriors view the behaviors of AAA development studios

01:15.820 --> 01:18.600
as being the gaming industry's biggest problem.

01:18.600 --> 01:24.080
And because they oppose AAA developers, they must be, by default, the gaming industry's

01:24.080 --> 01:25.080
solution.

01:25.080 --> 01:31.240
And because Gamergate opposes them, we must be, by default, supporting anything AAA studios

01:31.240 --> 01:33.120
do and be part of the problem.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.240
It's a very you're with us or against us mentality.

01:36.240 --> 01:41.200
Just for the sake of meticulousness, let's actually examine Jay Allen's claim.

01:41.200 --> 01:46.720
Nick Pongarten published Master of Play, The Story of Miyamoto, in The New Yorker on December

01:46.720 --> 01:47.980
20th, 2010.

01:47.980 --> 01:51.640
In it, it stated that Miyamoto's father got him an interview with Nintendo's president

01:51.640 --> 01:55.720
through a mutual friend, and that in his interview, he showed off toys of his own design.

01:55.720 --> 01:59.320
Miyamoto impressed them enough that he was hired to be an apprentice in the planning

01:59.320 --> 02:00.320
department.

02:00.320 --> 02:04.200
So, was Miyamoto hired because of his dad, like Jay Allen claimed?

02:04.200 --> 02:05.560
Well, no.

02:05.560 --> 02:09.920
He got the job interview because of his dad's friend, but it was Miyamoto himself who made

02:09.920 --> 02:11.920
a good impression during the interview.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.960
Is it nepotism that Miyamoto got hired?

02:13.960 --> 02:14.960
No.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.280
Is it nepotism that Miyamoto got a chance at an interview?

02:18.280 --> 02:19.960
Well, yes.

02:19.960 --> 02:25.040
But considering it happened in 1977, and ultimately gave birth to not just some of the best video

02:25.040 --> 02:29.920
games of all time, but also created modern gaming, perhaps we can cut them a little bit

02:29.920 --> 02:30.920
of slack.

02:30.920 --> 02:36.200
All of Jay Allen's rampant stupidity reminded me of David Arbok's recent tweet longer.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.840
Arbok is a software engineer and columnist over at Slate.

02:39.840 --> 02:44.120
We first got wind of him when he watched our videos on the IGF and Brandon Boye, and stated

02:44.120 --> 02:49.160
that the IGF merits an independent audit, and, prediction, Boye, Scavio, and Edwards

02:49.160 --> 02:51.440
will all step down within 18 months.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.920
His tweet longer really is a good read, I recommend everyone give it a good once over,

02:55.920 --> 02:58.280
but once again, I'll give a brief rundown here.

02:58.280 --> 03:02.640
Arbok says that the ultimate goal of the indie press, meaning Kotaku, Polygon, Gamasutra,

03:02.640 --> 03:05.340
and so on, is to gain more influence in the industry.

03:05.340 --> 03:09.240
They want to have the ears of the AAA developers, they want to be invited to the conferences,

03:09.240 --> 03:10.240
and so on.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.140
That remains their primary professional goal.

03:12.140 --> 03:15.960
While the individuals working for and running these outlets may have personal goals relating

03:15.960 --> 03:19.840
to their own career advancement, or bringing social justice into gaming or whatever, the

03:19.840 --> 03:23.320
top prize is still ultimately influence with the big boys.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.760
When Gamergate came along and began exposing the corrupt behaviour of these outlets, it

03:26.760 --> 03:30.180
lessened their influence, which is why it was in the best interest of these outlets

03:30.180 --> 03:35.040
to try and discredit Gamergate by any means necessary, even going so far as to link IGN's

03:35.040 --> 03:40.000
adoption of ethical policies to the idea that IGN is appeasing what they have publicly labelled

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
as a hate group.

03:41.040 --> 03:45.760
In other words, these indie press outlets desire to discredit Gamergate so much that

03:45.760 --> 03:49.640
they are willing to slander anybody who discusses ethics, whether they consider themselves to

03:49.640 --> 03:53.400
be affiliated with Gamergate or not, as racists and misogynists.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.360
Arbok says these indie press outlets were banking on the spectre of misogyny to be a

03:57.360 --> 04:01.520
powerful enough scare that AAA developers would come out of the woodwork to admonish

04:01.520 --> 04:05.960
Gamergate, and in doing so, they would be giving the indie press outlets the professional

04:05.960 --> 04:08.000
influence they so desperately crave.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.280
However there are two big problems with their plan.

04:10.280 --> 04:13.880
One, AAA developers largely don't share the same opinions with these journalists on

04:13.880 --> 04:18.960
a personal level, they see their social justice warrior leanings as curtailing artistic freedom.

04:18.960 --> 04:23.440
And two, AAA developers understood that the indie press outlets fucked up big time when

04:23.440 --> 04:25.280
they chose to attack all gamers.

04:25.280 --> 04:28.220
These outlets were willing to attack their own audience and tank their own businesses

04:28.220 --> 04:32.920
as a calculated gamble to improve their own standing in the industry, but the AAA developers

04:32.920 --> 04:35.320
aren't willing to follow them into that abyss.

04:35.320 --> 04:39.360
But most importantly of all, Arbok theorizes that AAA developers have been largely silent

04:39.360 --> 04:43.200
on Gamergate because they're willing to let Gamergate do the dirty work of taking out the indie

04:43.200 --> 04:45.960
press that has been a thorn in their sides for over a decade.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.960
The indie press outlets were an easy target for Gamergate because they are extremely incompetent

04:49.960 --> 04:54.280
with their corruption, while corporate corruption by actual industry names is often significantly

04:54.280 --> 04:56.880
more professional, and therefore harder to uncover.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.360
Arbok directly says the AAAs and mouthpieces like IGN run a professional outlet.

05:01.360 --> 05:05.200
Sure, it's all a big PR con job, but they aren't going to have journalists reviewing

05:05.200 --> 05:08.640
games by people they're publicly friends with, and they eventually realize to cut out the

05:08.640 --> 05:10.960
Doritos nonsense even if a bit too late.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.680
He also says that the indie press journals were the low-hanging fruit.

05:14.680 --> 05:19.440
Investigation into AAA corruption would take boots on the ground that Gamergate doesn't have.

05:19.440 --> 05:24.040
This reality that Arbok describes actually forms what I consider to be the only legitimate

05:24.040 --> 05:27.560
criticism anti-Gamergators have ever thrown at Gamergate.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.400
And that criticism is this.

05:29.400 --> 05:34.360
Gamergate only focuses on small-time corruption, for example like Zoe Quinn way back at the

05:34.360 --> 05:38.160
beginning, not because she was corrupt, but because she's a woman and her corruption

05:38.160 --> 05:40.920
offers misogynists a convenient excuse to harass her.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.640
I have no doubt that this is the case for some people.

05:43.640 --> 05:49.880
However, this criticism often leads anti-Gamergators to the next logical step, that Gamergate does

05:49.880 --> 05:54.840
not actually care about corruption at all, because it has yet to tackle AAA corruption,

05:54.840 --> 05:56.840
which is obviously much bigger.

05:56.840 --> 06:00.280
Arbok's tweet longer offers the best reply to this.

06:00.280 --> 06:04.420
It's not that Gamergate doesn't care, it's that Gamergate isn't big enough to do it.

06:04.580 --> 06:09.500
Everybody over here hopes that Gamergate will one day grow large enough to tackle AAA corruption,

06:09.500 --> 06:13.140
even if it would have to shed the Gamergate hashtag in order to get it done.

06:13.140 --> 06:17.060
And even among AAA corruption, there's some obvious low-hanging fruit too.

06:17.060 --> 06:21.000
Everybody knows about the Kane & Lynch Deadman controversy, but I'll give you a quick primer

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
right here.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.100
In 2007, Kane & Lynch came out.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.100
It sucked.

06:26.100 --> 06:30.220
Jeff Gerstmann, writing a review for GameSpot of the game, gave it a 6 out of 10, at the

06:30.220 --> 06:33.660
same time as Eidos was paying GameSpot a ton of money to advertise the game.

06:33.660 --> 06:37.300
Gerstmann was fired, and GameSpot refused to elaborate on it.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.300
But nobody was fooled.

06:38.300 --> 06:42.860
5 years later, after the non-disclosure agreement was up, Gerstmann confirmed what we all already

06:42.860 --> 06:47.220
knew in an interview on Giant Bomb, that Eidos pressured GameSpot to fire him, and GameSpot

06:47.220 --> 06:48.220
caved.

06:48.220 --> 06:52.360
And, as a related aside, in our last video we brought up Geogrify performing consulting

06:52.360 --> 06:58.680
for BioWare, EA, Microsoft Studios, and Ubisoft, while also simultaneously performing consulting

06:58.680 --> 07:02.840
for the IGDA, stating that there may be a potential conflict of interest when the same

07:02.840 --> 07:06.740
company performs consulting for the companies developers work for, and also the association

07:06.740 --> 07:09.060
meant to stand up for the rights of said developers.

07:09.060 --> 07:13.460
We also said that it probably wasn't a big deal, but our friend Derek Smart wasn't

07:13.460 --> 07:14.460
so convinced.

07:14.460 --> 07:17.760
He said there may actually be something to it, and he was going to look into it.

07:17.760 --> 07:21.160
Haven't heard back from him yet, one way or the other, and I hope he decides to come

07:21.160 --> 07:22.720
forward if he finds anything.

07:22.720 --> 07:26.440
But when it comes to corruption, not all the happenings take place on our side of the Pacific.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.840
Yeah, I'm talking about Japan.

07:27.840 --> 07:31.140
Gamergate doesn't seem to focus too much on the Japanese gaming industry, presumably

07:31.140 --> 07:35.660
because Gamergate is a primarily English-speaking movement without access to the non-English

07:35.660 --> 07:36.660
scene.

07:36.660 --> 07:40.420
Whenever gators do talk about Japan, it's almost always in reference to Mighty No. 9,

07:40.420 --> 07:43.700
which is less of a corruption issue and more of a social justice issue.

07:43.700 --> 07:47.260
Don't get me wrong, backers to Mighty No. 9 losing their privileges for supporting Gamergate

07:47.260 --> 07:51.520
is corrupt, people paid money for a service and lost it due to their political stance.

07:51.520 --> 07:56.060
But I hate to break it to you guys, but Dina pushing social justice views isn't corrupt,

07:56.060 --> 07:59.740
it's just mind-numbingly stupid, and she ultimately got what was coming to her.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.260
And then there's the mystical fabled Shenmue 3.

08:02.260 --> 08:06.740
For those of you who don't know, during Sony's E3 conference this year, Shenmue 3 was shown

08:06.740 --> 08:08.620
off along with a link to its Kickstarter.

08:08.620 --> 08:12.800
This was unusual, because usually during an E3 conference, the games shown off are already

08:12.800 --> 08:15.740
in development, usually by the company hosting the conference.

08:15.740 --> 08:19.940
But for Shenmue 3, it was a short teaser and a link to the Kickstarter.

08:19.940 --> 08:23.820
Kickstarter was knocked offline immediately, and Shenmue 3 got its requested 2 million

08:23.820 --> 08:26.160
bucks in about 24 hours.

08:26.160 --> 08:30.380
That seems like a lot of money, and it did break some Kickstarter records until you realize

08:30.380 --> 08:34.840
that Shenmue 1 cost between 47 million and 70 million dollars to develop.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.600
When you adjust that for inflation, that's 99 million.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.120
To contrast, Witcher 3's budget was 25 million.

08:41.120 --> 08:45.200
And even without doing the math, I think it's pretty obvious that Sony has a vested interest

08:45.200 --> 08:48.520
in seeing Shenmue 3 come out, and will be funding it themselves to that end.

08:48.520 --> 08:52.640
This was directly confirmed by Yu Suzuki, Shenmue's director, on a post on the Kickstarter,

08:52.640 --> 08:56.080
saying that both Sony and Shibuya Productions will be funding Shenmue 3.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.320
So what's the Kickstarter for?

08:57.320 --> 08:58.320
Just to drum up hype?

08:58.320 --> 09:00.480
To pad somebody's pockets with a bit of extra cash?

09:00.480 --> 09:03.800
As of recording this, the Kickstarter is at 4.1 million bucks.

09:03.800 --> 09:08.000
Assume for a minute, Shenmue 3 didn't have a Kickstarter, and Sony just announced it

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
at E3.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.120
You don't think Sony couldn't pony up an extra 4.1 million?

09:12.120 --> 09:14.560
It's good that Suzuki came out and clarified things.

09:14.560 --> 09:18.380
That sort of transparency is something we need to see more of, not less.

09:18.380 --> 09:21.060
But there's a major problem with the way Kickstarter is heading.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.280
It used to be a platform for people who couldn't fund their projects to get things off the

09:24.280 --> 09:25.280
ground.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.980
It's just a place for big names to hype up their next project.

09:27.980 --> 09:30.040
Kind of like the IGF, now that I think of it.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.480
But oh wait, we're not done with Japan just yet.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.920
Let's take a peek at the Japanese indie scene.

09:34.920 --> 09:41.020
In 2013, James Melk, or Mielk, I can't pronounce it, an employee at the Japanese developer

09:41.020 --> 09:45.540
Q Games, started up BitSummit, a convention for Japanese indies to get together and showcase

09:45.540 --> 09:46.540
their games.

09:46.540 --> 09:49.480
Polygon ran an article discussing the details of BitSummit's beginnings.

09:49.480 --> 09:53.760
In 2014, during the second BitSummit, they decided to give out awards to the best indie

09:53.760 --> 09:54.760
games at the show.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.760
Sounds pretty familiar so far, right?

09:56.760 --> 10:01.520
Well, on BitSummit's own page, five development studios are stated to be the backers behind

10:01.520 --> 10:02.520
BitSummit.

10:02.520 --> 10:08.520
They are Q Games, Vitai, 17-Bit, Pygmy Studio, and O2 Inc.

10:08.520 --> 10:13.280
Now anybody who knows about Q Games knows that it's not really an indie studio.

10:13.280 --> 10:18.420
It's made multiple first and second party games with both Sony and Nintendo, most notably

10:18.420 --> 10:21.680
Star Fox Command and Star Fox 64 3D.

10:21.680 --> 10:26.120
This is important because Q Games president, Dylan Cuthbert, programmed the original Star

10:26.120 --> 10:29.040
Fox on the Super Nintendo when he was just 17 years old.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.560
The point is, these guys aren't indies.

10:31.560 --> 10:35.400
Cuthbert married Miyamoto's daughter for fuck's sake, he's not an indie.

10:35.400 --> 10:39.600
Let's take a look at the second studio on the list of the five BitSummit backers, Vitai.

10:39.600 --> 10:43.800
On an old background page only accessible by the internet wayback machine, Vitai is

10:43.800 --> 10:48.760
described as being founded in 2002 by Giles Goddard, who has been an important figure

10:48.760 --> 10:53.040
in the Japanese games industry since 1990 when he moved to Kyoto to program Star Fox

10:53.040 --> 10:54.320
for the SNES.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.760
For many years he worked at Nintendo on a variety of key franchises, including Stunt

10:57.760 --> 11:00.680
Race FX, Super Mario 64, and Tinnitus Snowboarding.

11:00.680 --> 11:04.360
It's likely that Goddard and Cuthbert are old friends due to their time spent working

11:04.360 --> 11:05.640
on Star Fox together.

11:05.640 --> 11:09.120
And clearly, Goddard isn't really all that indie either.

11:09.120 --> 11:13.080
He went out and founded his own studio, sure, but he's still got his old connections and

11:13.080 --> 11:14.080
everything.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.600
Hell, the website boasts that Vitai works closely with Nintendo to create games such

11:16.600 --> 11:20.800
as Steel Diver, which was produced in close coordination with Shigeru Miyamoto.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.480
So again, not indie.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.360
But this is all okay so far.

11:25.360 --> 11:29.680
These guys are heading up BitSummit, they don't necessarily have to be indie themselves.

11:29.680 --> 11:35.200
Except that, the modern zombie taxi driver, a game by Vitai, won the Vermillion Gate award

11:35.200 --> 11:39.700
at BitSummit 2014, Vermillion Gate basically being BitSummit's best of show.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.440
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:41.440 --> 11:45.680
Not only is Vitai not an indie studio by any stretch of the imagination, what with their

11:45.680 --> 11:50.200
buddy buddying it up with Nintendo, but Vitai is a fucking backer of BitSummit.

11:50.200 --> 11:55.440
Vitai helps support and organize an award show, and then wins an award at that very

11:55.440 --> 12:01.040
same show, while another of the backers, Q Games, is run by a personal friend of Vitai's

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
director.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.040
That's just awesome.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.120
Is there just something about the term indie that makes it an incestuous circlejerk no

12:06.120 --> 12:07.520
matter what language it's in?

12:07.520 --> 12:11.160
I actually thought the Japanese scene would have been free of this shit, but no, I guess

12:11.160 --> 12:12.600
it's the same everywhere you go.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.400
Ah, let's just cover all our bases here, let's look at the other three backers.

12:16.400 --> 12:22.400
17bit, run by Jake Cazdel, his resume includes working at EA, working at Sega where he helped

12:22.400 --> 12:27.240
make Rez and Space Channel 5, and working on Illusion of Gaia, as well as a number of

12:27.240 --> 12:28.720
unnamed N64 games.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.600
It's the same situation as with Goddard at Vitai and Cuthbert at Q Games.

12:32.600 --> 12:36.000
The might have started their own studios, but they've still got all their old connections

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
and friendships.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
They're not indies.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.560
Wait, wait, wait.

12:39.560 --> 12:42.480
We are a Seattle-based independent developer?

12:42.480 --> 12:45.640
You're not even over there and you have your thumbs in BitSummit?

12:45.640 --> 12:48.840
Pygmy Studios and O2 Inc seem to be legit enough.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.880
At the very least they're fucking Japanese.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.120
Let's take a peek at the other awards winners.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.680
Lots of Japanese text.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.160
Something to be expected at a Japanese awards show.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.320
Hold on.

12:59.320 --> 13:04.440
Funkatronic Labs, Nova 11, won second place for Game Design and runner up for Vermillion

13:04.440 --> 13:05.440
Gate.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.080
Let's take a peek at their about page.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.880
Pasadena, California?

13:08.880 --> 13:10.760
These guys aren't even a Japanese indie dev.

13:10.760 --> 13:15.280
Is this sort of like how one of Zoe Quinn's games won in IGF China, even though I doubt

13:15.280 --> 13:18.420
Zoe's ever actually stepped foot in the Glorious Motherland?

13:18.420 --> 13:22.880
This video is over two months late, and the primary reason for that is because Camry Lady

13:22.880 --> 13:24.600
wanted to tackle the triple A's.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.240
And she did a lot of digging.

13:26.240 --> 13:30.400
But the cold heart truth is, you can only do so much being an armchair detective.

13:30.400 --> 13:34.480
David Arbok was pretty spot on when he said that triple A corruption isn't sloppy and

13:34.480 --> 13:36.760
stupid the way indie corruption is.

13:36.760 --> 13:42.960
Obama spent a ton of time overturning every rock, tapping every resources, asking questions

13:42.960 --> 13:47.600
in private, and ultimately even traveling down to Toronto to meet with an old high school

13:47.600 --> 13:52.600
friend, who by random chance is currently married to a small time Japanese indie dev,

13:52.600 --> 13:54.640
and we're in Canada to visit her family.

13:54.640 --> 13:59.200
He told her that the Japanese indie scene was just as bullshit as the English one, and

13:59.200 --> 14:01.360
directed her towards BitSummit.

14:01.360 --> 14:05.480
And really, for all of her efforts, this is the most she could get.

14:05.480 --> 14:09.080
That said, Nintendo is a tertiary party in the same corrupt bullshit in the Japanese

14:09.080 --> 14:11.900
indie scene that we're all used to hearing about by now.

14:11.900 --> 14:16.240
In my opinion, no one at Nintendo themselves even seems to be guilty of anything.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.760
It's all just former Nintendo employees thinking they can put on the indie hat while

14:19.760 --> 14:23.400
keeping all of their old connections, and act like kings of the shitpile.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.800
Does this mean that when it comes to triple A corruption, Gamegate is completely outmatched

14:26.800 --> 14:27.800
and useless?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.520
Well, no, I don't think it does.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.520
People have remarked that Gamegate has shifted focus from being an angry mob and into a vigilant

14:34.520 --> 14:38.680
watchdog, and the truth is, that is the only way that triple A corruption is ever going

14:38.680 --> 14:39.680
to be routed.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.920
Remember when the Xbox One got completely shit on with its mandatory Kinect and its

14:42.920 --> 14:47.060
always-on functionality, and the arrogance to the point of the people at Microsoft telling

14:47.060 --> 14:51.360
consumers to buy an Xbox 360 if they wanted a console that wasn't always on?

14:51.360 --> 14:54.040
Remember how they got their shit royally kicked in for it?

14:54.040 --> 14:55.920
That's ultimately who we are.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.940
As Gamegaters, and as gamers.

14:57.940 --> 15:03.080
If you think someone's being corrupt, whether it's with reviews, or DRM, or bullshit

15:03.080 --> 15:08.240
DLC in microtransactions, or whatever, all you need to do is talk about it.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.840
We're all aware of the shit they try to pull now, and we have the tools to get the

15:11.840 --> 15:12.840
word out.

15:12.840 --> 15:17.000
This isn't directly related, but Reddit is burning right now, because everybody is

15:17.000 --> 15:21.300
hyper aware of what all of these shitheads are trying to slip by under our noses.

15:21.300 --> 15:27.040
We keep them alive, and we've also become their most dangerous enemy, an informed consumer

15:27.040 --> 15:28.040
base.

15:28.040 --> 15:31.100
Arbok was right when he said that the triple A's are content to let us deal with their

15:31.100 --> 15:35.000
journal problem for them, and honestly we are content to do it, but we're also keeping

15:35.000 --> 15:37.420
a very close eye on you triple A's.

15:37.420 --> 15:41.420
YouTubers are far less likely to gloss over a game's obvious problems than a reviewer

15:41.420 --> 15:42.420
is.

15:42.420 --> 15:46.300
Sup guys, here's a bit of an after video special.

15:46.300 --> 15:49.560
I'm really sorry it took us so long to get this one out, but it happened pretty much

15:49.560 --> 15:50.560
like I said.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.820
Cam spent a lot of time investigating, and unfortunately just didn't dig up much to

15:53.820 --> 15:54.820
show for it.

15:54.820 --> 15:58.080
The only way we're ever going to get conclusive proof of triple A corruption is either from

15:58.080 --> 16:01.920
the inside, or something stupidly public like Kane & Lynch happens again.

16:01.920 --> 16:05.720
I'm still holding out hope that developers will feel free to speak to us or others, even

16:05.720 --> 16:06.720
anonymously.

16:06.720 --> 16:10.840
I also plan to release a video discussing the future of the Indefensible series, and

16:10.840 --> 16:14.320
other happenings on the Short Fighter Taku channel sometime tomorrow, so please come

16:14.320 --> 16:15.400
back and check that out.

16:15.400 --> 16:19.000
But basically, regardless of the reasoning behind it, the wait between this video and

16:19.000 --> 16:23.760
the last one was just unacceptably long, especially since a regular update to this series was

16:23.760 --> 16:25.800
promised as a Patreon goal.

16:25.800 --> 16:30.240
I mean, you guys gave us money, and for the past two months we've failed to come through

16:30.240 --> 16:31.240
with the goods.

16:31.240 --> 16:35.640
There's really no excuse for that, and we do have other videos coming in short order

16:35.640 --> 16:37.360
to rectify the situation.

16:37.360 --> 16:42.280
I've seen what kind of people exploit Patreon by promising goals and not following through,

16:42.280 --> 16:46.880
and we've all agreed that we need to actually keep up with the videos y'all are here for,

16:46.880 --> 16:48.480
or just shut the Patreon down.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.120
And we choose option one.

16:50.120 --> 16:55.560
So this is our formal apology to you, our viewers, but with the lack of content, and

16:55.560 --> 16:58.400
you will see the next Indefensible very soon.

16:58.400 --> 17:05.600
And speaking of Patreon, a very special thanks to Rex, James Knotz, Smitho, Samuel Dillon,

17:05.600 --> 17:14.640
Murray, BigBoss79, Pharmacist, Garrison James Hamilton, Berto Elcon, Simon Kvam, Hente Logic,

17:14.640 --> 17:18.200
Pasquale Festa, and anybody else who contributes anonymously.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.040
Any amount helps, and you guys are amazing.

17:21.040 --> 17:25.200
We've put your money to good use, buying new equipment that our show desperately needs.

17:25.200 --> 17:31.160
If you want to support the show, the Patreon address is www.patreon.com slash shortfireotaku.

17:31.160 --> 17:36.840
Or if you'd rather do a one-time thing, our paypal's at shortfireotaku at hotmail.com.

17:36.840 --> 17:41.720
We post receipts and vlogs about the equipment we buy, so you'll always know your money is

17:41.720 --> 17:44.320
going towards our videos and our channel.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.840
And of course, don't feel pressured to give or anything.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.920
You'll always be welcome whether you give or not.

17:48.920 --> 17:53.200
If you want to see more of us, me and my roommate Dave play video games twice a day on this

17:53.200 --> 17:56.480
channel, and we're actually starting up a new round of games right now if you want to

17:56.480 --> 17:58.480
jump on board with a fresh run of something.

17:58.480 --> 18:02.120
We're also doing anime reviews again finally too, with the most recent review just coming

18:02.120 --> 18:05.240
out on the 3rd, and the next review coming in about 3 weeks time.

18:05.240 --> 18:09.680
And well, if you're only here to listen to me talk about Gamergate, come back for my update

18:09.680 --> 18:13.200
video tomorrow, and the next Indefensible video next week.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.880
Wherever you see me, I'll see you there.
