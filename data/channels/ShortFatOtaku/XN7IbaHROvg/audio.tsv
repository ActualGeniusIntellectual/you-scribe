0	4640	This video is not meant to be a statement of absolute fact, nor does it exist to directly
4640	6160	accuse anybody of anything.
6160	9600	Rather, it's a presentation of the evidence that we've discovered and an open call for
9600	13840	others on both the inside and out to discuss the issues explored therein.
13840	18760	Furthermore, any audio accompanied by the Devon no-talent gaming artwork can be considered
18760	21740	to be entirely our own opinion or conjecture on a topic.
21740	22620	Thank you and enjoy!
30000	41320	Sorry for the hideously late video, buddies, but the subject matter ended up taking a lot
41320	43440	longer to investigate than we thought.
43440	45880	Recently, something stupid happened on Twitter.
45880	47000	Shocking, right?
47000	53000	Jay Allen, aka a man in black, tweeted, Shigeru Miyamoto was hired because of nepotism.
53000	57680	And then later, seriously, Shigeru Miyamoto got a job at Nintendo because his father knew
57680	58680	somebody there.
58680	63960	Thankfully, many people saw exactly how retarded Jay Allen was being, and the internet gave
63960	66520	him the lashing he so rightly deserved.
66520	70520	Margaret Jell posted a passage regarding Jay Allen's stupidity, which I'll summarize here
70520	71520	quickly.
71520	75820	Some indie devs and social justice warriors view the behaviors of AAA development studios
75820	78600	as being the gaming industry's biggest problem.
78600	84080	And because they oppose AAA developers, they must be, by default, the gaming industry's
84080	85080	solution.
85080	91240	And because Gamergate opposes them, we must be, by default, supporting anything AAA studios
91240	93120	do and be part of the problem.
93120	96240	It's a very you're with us or against us mentality.
96240	101200	Just for the sake of meticulousness, let's actually examine Jay Allen's claim.
101200	106720	Nick Pongarten published Master of Play, The Story of Miyamoto, in The New Yorker on December
106720	107980	20th, 2010.
107980	111640	In it, it stated that Miyamoto's father got him an interview with Nintendo's president
111640	115720	through a mutual friend, and that in his interview, he showed off toys of his own design.
115720	119320	Miyamoto impressed them enough that he was hired to be an apprentice in the planning
119320	120320	department.
120320	124200	So, was Miyamoto hired because of his dad, like Jay Allen claimed?
124200	125560	Well, no.
125560	129920	He got the job interview because of his dad's friend, but it was Miyamoto himself who made
129920	131920	a good impression during the interview.
131920	133960	Is it nepotism that Miyamoto got hired?
133960	134960	No.
134960	138280	Is it nepotism that Miyamoto got a chance at an interview?
138280	139960	Well, yes.
139960	145040	But considering it happened in 1977, and ultimately gave birth to not just some of the best video
145040	149920	games of all time, but also created modern gaming, perhaps we can cut them a little bit
149920	150920	of slack.
150920	156200	All of Jay Allen's rampant stupidity reminded me of David Arbok's recent tweet longer.
156200	159840	Arbok is a software engineer and columnist over at Slate.
159840	164120	We first got wind of him when he watched our videos on the IGF and Brandon Boye, and stated
164120	169160	that the IGF merits an independent audit, and, prediction, Boye, Scavio, and Edwards
169160	171440	will all step down within 18 months.
171440	175920	His tweet longer really is a good read, I recommend everyone give it a good once over,
175920	178280	but once again, I'll give a brief rundown here.
178280	182640	Arbok says that the ultimate goal of the indie press, meaning Kotaku, Polygon, Gamasutra,
182640	185340	and so on, is to gain more influence in the industry.
185340	189240	They want to have the ears of the AAA developers, they want to be invited to the conferences,
189240	190240	and so on.
190240	192140	That remains their primary professional goal.
192140	195960	While the individuals working for and running these outlets may have personal goals relating
195960	199840	to their own career advancement, or bringing social justice into gaming or whatever, the
199840	203320	top prize is still ultimately influence with the big boys.
203320	206760	When Gamergate came along and began exposing the corrupt behaviour of these outlets, it
206760	210180	lessened their influence, which is why it was in the best interest of these outlets
210180	215040	to try and discredit Gamergate by any means necessary, even going so far as to link IGN's
215040	220000	adoption of ethical policies to the idea that IGN is appeasing what they have publicly labelled
220000	221000	as a hate group.
221040	225760	In other words, these indie press outlets desire to discredit Gamergate so much that
225760	229640	they are willing to slander anybody who discusses ethics, whether they consider themselves to
229640	233400	be affiliated with Gamergate or not, as racists and misogynists.
233400	237360	Arbok says these indie press outlets were banking on the spectre of misogyny to be a
237360	241520	powerful enough scare that AAA developers would come out of the woodwork to admonish
241520	245960	Gamergate, and in doing so, they would be giving the indie press outlets the professional
245960	248000	influence they so desperately crave.
248000	250280	However there are two big problems with their plan.
250280	253880	One, AAA developers largely don't share the same opinions with these journalists on
253880	258960	a personal level, they see their social justice warrior leanings as curtailing artistic freedom.
258960	263440	And two, AAA developers understood that the indie press outlets fucked up big time when
263440	265280	they chose to attack all gamers.
265280	268220	These outlets were willing to attack their own audience and tank their own businesses
268220	272920	as a calculated gamble to improve their own standing in the industry, but the AAA developers
272920	275320	aren't willing to follow them into that abyss.
275320	279360	But most importantly of all, Arbok theorizes that AAA developers have been largely silent
279360	283200	on Gamergate because they're willing to let Gamergate do the dirty work of taking out the indie
283200	285960	press that has been a thorn in their sides for over a decade.
285960	289960	The indie press outlets were an easy target for Gamergate because they are extremely incompetent
289960	294280	with their corruption, while corporate corruption by actual industry names is often significantly
294280	296880	more professional, and therefore harder to uncover.
296880	301360	Arbok directly says the AAAs and mouthpieces like IGN run a professional outlet.
301360	305200	Sure, it's all a big PR con job, but they aren't going to have journalists reviewing
305200	308640	games by people they're publicly friends with, and they eventually realize to cut out the
308640	310960	Doritos nonsense even if a bit too late.
310960	314680	He also says that the indie press journals were the low-hanging fruit.
314680	319440	Investigation into AAA corruption would take boots on the ground that Gamergate doesn't have.
319440	324040	This reality that Arbok describes actually forms what I consider to be the only legitimate
324040	327560	criticism anti-Gamergators have ever thrown at Gamergate.
327560	329400	And that criticism is this.
329400	334360	Gamergate only focuses on small-time corruption, for example like Zoe Quinn way back at the
334360	338160	beginning, not because she was corrupt, but because she's a woman and her corruption
338160	340920	offers misogynists a convenient excuse to harass her.
340920	343640	I have no doubt that this is the case for some people.
343640	349880	However, this criticism often leads anti-Gamergators to the next logical step, that Gamergate does
349880	354840	not actually care about corruption at all, because it has yet to tackle AAA corruption,
354840	356840	which is obviously much bigger.
356840	360280	Arbok's tweet longer offers the best reply to this.
360280	364420	It's not that Gamergate doesn't care, it's that Gamergate isn't big enough to do it.
364580	369500	Everybody over here hopes that Gamergate will one day grow large enough to tackle AAA corruption,
369500	373140	even if it would have to shed the Gamergate hashtag in order to get it done.
373140	377060	And even among AAA corruption, there's some obvious low-hanging fruit too.
377060	381000	Everybody knows about the Kane & Lynch Deadman controversy, but I'll give you a quick primer
381000	382000	right here.
382000	385100	In 2007, Kane & Lynch came out.
385100	386100	It sucked.
386100	390220	Jeff Gerstmann, writing a review for GameSpot of the game, gave it a 6 out of 10, at the
390220	393660	same time as Eidos was paying GameSpot a ton of money to advertise the game.
393660	397300	Gerstmann was fired, and GameSpot refused to elaborate on it.
397300	398300	But nobody was fooled.
398300	402860	5 years later, after the non-disclosure agreement was up, Gerstmann confirmed what we all already
402860	407220	knew in an interview on Giant Bomb, that Eidos pressured GameSpot to fire him, and GameSpot
407220	408220	caved.
408220	412360	And, as a related aside, in our last video we brought up Geogrify performing consulting
412360	418680	for BioWare, EA, Microsoft Studios, and Ubisoft, while also simultaneously performing consulting
418680	422840	for the IGDA, stating that there may be a potential conflict of interest when the same
422840	426740	company performs consulting for the companies developers work for, and also the association
426740	429060	meant to stand up for the rights of said developers.
429060	433460	We also said that it probably wasn't a big deal, but our friend Derek Smart wasn't
433460	434460	so convinced.
434460	437760	He said there may actually be something to it, and he was going to look into it.
437760	441160	Haven't heard back from him yet, one way or the other, and I hope he decides to come
441160	442720	forward if he finds anything.
442720	446440	But when it comes to corruption, not all the happenings take place on our side of the Pacific.
446440	447840	Yeah, I'm talking about Japan.
447840	451140	Gamergate doesn't seem to focus too much on the Japanese gaming industry, presumably
451140	455660	because Gamergate is a primarily English-speaking movement without access to the non-English
455660	456660	scene.
456660	460420	Whenever gators do talk about Japan, it's almost always in reference to Mighty No. 9,
460420	463700	which is less of a corruption issue and more of a social justice issue.
463700	467260	Don't get me wrong, backers to Mighty No. 9 losing their privileges for supporting Gamergate
467260	471520	is corrupt, people paid money for a service and lost it due to their political stance.
471520	476060	But I hate to break it to you guys, but Dina pushing social justice views isn't corrupt,
476060	479740	it's just mind-numbingly stupid, and she ultimately got what was coming to her.
479740	482260	And then there's the mystical fabled Shenmue 3.
482260	486740	For those of you who don't know, during Sony's E3 conference this year, Shenmue 3 was shown
486740	488620	off along with a link to its Kickstarter.
488620	492800	This was unusual, because usually during an E3 conference, the games shown off are already
492800	495740	in development, usually by the company hosting the conference.
495740	499940	But for Shenmue 3, it was a short teaser and a link to the Kickstarter.
499940	503820	Kickstarter was knocked offline immediately, and Shenmue 3 got its requested 2 million
503820	506160	bucks in about 24 hours.
506160	510380	That seems like a lot of money, and it did break some Kickstarter records until you realize
510380	514840	that Shenmue 1 cost between 47 million and 70 million dollars to develop.
514840	517600	When you adjust that for inflation, that's 99 million.
517600	521120	To contrast, Witcher 3's budget was 25 million.
521120	525200	And even without doing the math, I think it's pretty obvious that Sony has a vested interest
525200	528520	in seeing Shenmue 3 come out, and will be funding it themselves to that end.
528520	532640	This was directly confirmed by Yu Suzuki, Shenmue's director, on a post on the Kickstarter,
532640	536080	saying that both Sony and Shibuya Productions will be funding Shenmue 3.
536080	537320	So what's the Kickstarter for?
537320	538320	Just to drum up hype?
538320	540480	To pad somebody's pockets with a bit of extra cash?
540480	543800	As of recording this, the Kickstarter is at 4.1 million bucks.
543800	548000	Assume for a minute, Shenmue 3 didn't have a Kickstarter, and Sony just announced it
548000	549000	at E3.
549000	552120	You don't think Sony couldn't pony up an extra 4.1 million?
552120	554560	It's good that Suzuki came out and clarified things.
554560	558380	That sort of transparency is something we need to see more of, not less.
558380	561060	But there's a major problem with the way Kickstarter is heading.
561060	564280	It used to be a platform for people who couldn't fund their projects to get things off the
564280	565280	ground.
565480	567980	It's just a place for big names to hype up their next project.
567980	570040	Kind of like the IGF, now that I think of it.
570040	572480	But oh wait, we're not done with Japan just yet.
572480	574920	Let's take a peek at the Japanese indie scene.
574920	581020	In 2013, James Melk, or Mielk, I can't pronounce it, an employee at the Japanese developer
581020	585540	Q Games, started up BitSummit, a convention for Japanese indies to get together and showcase
585540	586540	their games.
586540	589480	Polygon ran an article discussing the details of BitSummit's beginnings.
589480	593760	In 2014, during the second BitSummit, they decided to give out awards to the best indie
593760	594760	games at the show.
595240	596760	Sounds pretty familiar so far, right?
596760	601520	Well, on BitSummit's own page, five development studios are stated to be the backers behind
601520	602520	BitSummit.
602520	608520	They are Q Games, Vitai, 17-Bit, Pygmy Studio, and O2 Inc.
608520	613280	Now anybody who knows about Q Games knows that it's not really an indie studio.
613280	618420	It's made multiple first and second party games with both Sony and Nintendo, most notably
618420	621680	Star Fox Command and Star Fox 64 3D.
621680	626120	This is important because Q Games president, Dylan Cuthbert, programmed the original Star
626120	629040	Fox on the Super Nintendo when he was just 17 years old.
629040	631560	The point is, these guys aren't indies.
631560	635400	Cuthbert married Miyamoto's daughter for fuck's sake, he's not an indie.
635400	639600	Let's take a look at the second studio on the list of the five BitSummit backers, Vitai.
639600	643800	On an old background page only accessible by the internet wayback machine, Vitai is
643800	648760	described as being founded in 2002 by Giles Goddard, who has been an important figure
648760	653040	in the Japanese games industry since 1990 when he moved to Kyoto to program Star Fox
653040	654320	for the SNES.
654320	657760	For many years he worked at Nintendo on a variety of key franchises, including Stunt
657760	660680	Race FX, Super Mario 64, and Tinnitus Snowboarding.
660680	664360	It's likely that Goddard and Cuthbert are old friends due to their time spent working
664360	665640	on Star Fox together.
665640	669120	And clearly, Goddard isn't really all that indie either.
669120	673080	He went out and founded his own studio, sure, but he's still got his old connections and
673080	674080	everything.
674080	676600	Hell, the website boasts that Vitai works closely with Nintendo to create games such
676600	680800	as Steel Diver, which was produced in close coordination with Shigeru Miyamoto.
680800	682480	So again, not indie.
682480	685360	But this is all okay so far.
685360	689680	These guys are heading up BitSummit, they don't necessarily have to be indie themselves.
689680	695200	Except that, the modern zombie taxi driver, a game by Vitai, won the Vermillion Gate award
695200	699700	at BitSummit 2014, Vermillion Gate basically being BitSummit's best of show.
699700	701440	Are you fucking kidding me?
701440	705680	Not only is Vitai not an indie studio by any stretch of the imagination, what with their
705680	710200	buddy buddying it up with Nintendo, but Vitai is a fucking backer of BitSummit.
710200	715440	Vitai helps support and organize an award show, and then wins an award at that very
715440	721040	same show, while another of the backers, Q Games, is run by a personal friend of Vitai's
721040	722040	director.
722040	723040	That's just awesome.
723040	726120	Is there just something about the term indie that makes it an incestuous circlejerk no
726120	727520	matter what language it's in?
727520	731160	I actually thought the Japanese scene would have been free of this shit, but no, I guess
731160	732600	it's the same everywhere you go.
732600	736400	Ah, let's just cover all our bases here, let's look at the other three backers.
736400	742400	17bit, run by Jake Cazdel, his resume includes working at EA, working at Sega where he helped
742400	747240	make Rez and Space Channel 5, and working on Illusion of Gaia, as well as a number of
747240	748720	unnamed N64 games.
748720	752600	It's the same situation as with Goddard at Vitai and Cuthbert at Q Games.
752600	756000	The might have started their own studios, but they've still got all their old connections
756000	757000	and friendships.
757000	758000	They're not indies.
758000	759560	Wait, wait, wait.
759560	762480	We are a Seattle-based independent developer?
762480	765640	You're not even over there and you have your thumbs in BitSummit?
765640	768840	Pygmy Studios and O2 Inc seem to be legit enough.
768840	771880	At the very least they're fucking Japanese.
771880	774120	Let's take a peek at the other awards winners.
774120	775680	Lots of Japanese text.
775680	778160	Something to be expected at a Japanese awards show.
778160	779320	Hold on.
779320	784440	Funkatronic Labs, Nova 11, won second place for Game Design and runner up for Vermillion
784440	785440	Gate.
785440	787080	Let's take a peek at their about page.
787080	788880	Pasadena, California?
788880	790760	These guys aren't even a Japanese indie dev.
790760	795280	Is this sort of like how one of Zoe Quinn's games won in IGF China, even though I doubt
795280	798420	Zoe's ever actually stepped foot in the Glorious Motherland?
798420	802880	This video is over two months late, and the primary reason for that is because Camry Lady
802880	804600	wanted to tackle the triple A's.
804600	806240	And she did a lot of digging.
806240	810400	But the cold heart truth is, you can only do so much being an armchair detective.
810400	814480	David Arbok was pretty spot on when he said that triple A corruption isn't sloppy and
814480	816760	stupid the way indie corruption is.
816760	822960	Obama spent a ton of time overturning every rock, tapping every resources, asking questions
822960	827600	in private, and ultimately even traveling down to Toronto to meet with an old high school
827600	832600	friend, who by random chance is currently married to a small time Japanese indie dev,
832600	834640	and we're in Canada to visit her family.
834640	839200	He told her that the Japanese indie scene was just as bullshit as the English one, and
839200	841360	directed her towards BitSummit.
841360	845480	And really, for all of her efforts, this is the most she could get.
845480	849080	That said, Nintendo is a tertiary party in the same corrupt bullshit in the Japanese
849080	851900	indie scene that we're all used to hearing about by now.
851900	856240	In my opinion, no one at Nintendo themselves even seems to be guilty of anything.
856240	859760	It's all just former Nintendo employees thinking they can put on the indie hat while
859760	863400	keeping all of their old connections, and act like kings of the shitpile.
863400	866800	Does this mean that when it comes to triple A corruption, Gamegate is completely outmatched
866800	867800	and useless?
867800	870520	Well, no, I don't think it does.
870520	874520	People have remarked that Gamegate has shifted focus from being an angry mob and into a vigilant
874520	878680	watchdog, and the truth is, that is the only way that triple A corruption is ever going
878680	879680	to be routed.
879680	882920	Remember when the Xbox One got completely shit on with its mandatory Kinect and its
882920	887060	always-on functionality, and the arrogance to the point of the people at Microsoft telling
887060	891360	consumers to buy an Xbox 360 if they wanted a console that wasn't always on?
891360	894040	Remember how they got their shit royally kicked in for it?
894040	895920	That's ultimately who we are.
895920	897940	As Gamegaters, and as gamers.
897940	903080	If you think someone's being corrupt, whether it's with reviews, or DRM, or bullshit
903080	908240	DLC in microtransactions, or whatever, all you need to do is talk about it.
908240	911840	We're all aware of the shit they try to pull now, and we have the tools to get the
911840	912840	word out.
912840	917000	This isn't directly related, but Reddit is burning right now, because everybody is
917000	921300	hyper aware of what all of these shitheads are trying to slip by under our noses.
921300	927040	We keep them alive, and we've also become their most dangerous enemy, an informed consumer
927040	928040	base.
928040	931100	Arbok was right when he said that the triple A's are content to let us deal with their
931100	935000	journal problem for them, and honestly we are content to do it, but we're also keeping
935000	937420	a very close eye on you triple A's.
937420	941420	YouTubers are far less likely to gloss over a game's obvious problems than a reviewer
941420	942420	is.
942420	946300	Sup guys, here's a bit of an after video special.
946300	949560	I'm really sorry it took us so long to get this one out, but it happened pretty much
949560	950560	like I said.
950560	953820	Cam spent a lot of time investigating, and unfortunately just didn't dig up much to
953820	954820	show for it.
954820	958080	The only way we're ever going to get conclusive proof of triple A corruption is either from
958080	961920	the inside, or something stupidly public like Kane & Lynch happens again.
961920	965720	I'm still holding out hope that developers will feel free to speak to us or others, even
965720	966720	anonymously.
966720	970840	I also plan to release a video discussing the future of the Indefensible series, and
970840	974320	other happenings on the Short Fighter Taku channel sometime tomorrow, so please come
974320	975400	back and check that out.
975400	979000	But basically, regardless of the reasoning behind it, the wait between this video and
979000	983760	the last one was just unacceptably long, especially since a regular update to this series was
983760	985800	promised as a Patreon goal.
985800	990240	I mean, you guys gave us money, and for the past two months we've failed to come through
990240	991240	with the goods.
991240	995640	There's really no excuse for that, and we do have other videos coming in short order
995640	997360	to rectify the situation.
997360	1002280	I've seen what kind of people exploit Patreon by promising goals and not following through,
1002280	1006880	and we've all agreed that we need to actually keep up with the videos y'all are here for,
1006880	1008480	or just shut the Patreon down.
1008480	1010120	And we choose option one.
1010120	1015560	So this is our formal apology to you, our viewers, but with the lack of content, and
1015560	1018400	you will see the next Indefensible very soon.
1018400	1025600	And speaking of Patreon, a very special thanks to Rex, James Knotz, Smitho, Samuel Dillon,
1025600	1034640	Murray, BigBoss79, Pharmacist, Garrison James Hamilton, Berto Elcon, Simon Kvam, Hente Logic,
1034640	1038200	Pasquale Festa, and anybody else who contributes anonymously.
1038200	1041040	Any amount helps, and you guys are amazing.
1041040	1045200	We've put your money to good use, buying new equipment that our show desperately needs.
1045200	1051160	If you want to support the show, the Patreon address is www.patreon.com slash shortfireotaku.
1051160	1056840	Or if you'd rather do a one-time thing, our paypal's at shortfireotaku at hotmail.com.
1056840	1061720	We post receipts and vlogs about the equipment we buy, so you'll always know your money is
1061720	1064320	going towards our videos and our channel.
1064320	1066840	And of course, don't feel pressured to give or anything.
1066840	1068920	You'll always be welcome whether you give or not.
1068920	1073200	If you want to see more of us, me and my roommate Dave play video games twice a day on this
1073200	1076480	channel, and we're actually starting up a new round of games right now if you want to
1076480	1078480	jump on board with a fresh run of something.
1078480	1082120	We're also doing anime reviews again finally too, with the most recent review just coming
1082120	1085240	out on the 3rd, and the next review coming in about 3 weeks time.
1085240	1089680	And well, if you're only here to listen to me talk about Gamergate, come back for my update
1089680	1093200	video tomorrow, and the next Indefensible video next week.
1093200	1094880	Wherever you see me, I'll see you there.
