1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
This video is not meant to be a statement of absolute fact, nor does it exist to directly

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,160
accuse anybody of anything.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,600
Rather, it's a presentation of the evidence that we've discovered and an open call for

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,840
others on both the inside and out to discuss the issues explored therein.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,760
Furthermore, any audio accompanied by the Devon no-talent gaming artwork can be considered

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,740
to be entirely our own opinion or conjecture on a topic.

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,620
Thank you and enjoy!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,320
Sorry for the hideously late video, buddies, but the subject matter ended up taking a lot

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,440
longer to investigate than we thought.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,880
Recently, something stupid happened on Twitter.

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,000
Shocking, right?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Jay Allen, aka a man in black, tweeted, Shigeru Miyamoto was hired because of nepotism.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,680
And then later, seriously, Shigeru Miyamoto got a job at Nintendo because his father knew

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
somebody there.

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,960
Thankfully, many people saw exactly how retarded Jay Allen was being, and the internet gave

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,520
him the lashing he so rightly deserved.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Margaret Jell posted a passage regarding Jay Allen's stupidity, which I'll summarize here

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
quickly.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,820
Some indie devs and social justice warriors view the behaviors of AAA development studios

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,600
as being the gaming industry's biggest problem.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,080
And because they oppose AAA developers, they must be, by default, the gaming industry's

22
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
solution.

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,240
And because Gamergate opposes them, we must be, by default, supporting anything AAA studios

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,120
do and be part of the problem.

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,240
It's a very you're with us or against us mentality.

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,200
Just for the sake of meticulousness, let's actually examine Jay Allen's claim.

27
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,720
Nick Pongarten published Master of Play, The Story of Miyamoto, in The New Yorker on December

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,980
20th, 2010.

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,640
In it, it stated that Miyamoto's father got him an interview with Nintendo's president

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,720
through a mutual friend, and that in his interview, he showed off toys of his own design.

31
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,320
Miyamoto impressed them enough that he was hired to be an apprentice in the planning

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
department.

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,200
So, was Miyamoto hired because of his dad, like Jay Allen claimed?

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,560
Well, no.

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,920
He got the job interview because of his dad's friend, but it was Miyamoto himself who made

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,920
a good impression during the interview.

37
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,960
Is it nepotism that Miyamoto got hired?

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
No.

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,280
Is it nepotism that Miyamoto got a chance at an interview?

40
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,960
Well, yes.

41
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,040
But considering it happened in 1977, and ultimately gave birth to not just some of the best video

42
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,920
games of all time, but also created modern gaming, perhaps we can cut them a little bit

43
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
of slack.

44
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,200
All of Jay Allen's rampant stupidity reminded me of David Arbok's recent tweet longer.

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,840
Arbok is a software engineer and columnist over at Slate.

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,120
We first got wind of him when he watched our videos on the IGF and Brandon Boye, and stated

47
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,160
that the IGF merits an independent audit, and, prediction, Boye, Scavio, and Edwards

48
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,440
will all step down within 18 months.

49
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,920
His tweet longer really is a good read, I recommend everyone give it a good once over,

50
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,280
but once again, I'll give a brief rundown here.

51
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,640
Arbok says that the ultimate goal of the indie press, meaning Kotaku, Polygon, Gamasutra,

52
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,340
and so on, is to gain more influence in the industry.

53
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,240
They want to have the ears of the AAA developers, they want to be invited to the conferences,

54
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
and so on.

55
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,140
That remains their primary professional goal.

56
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,960
While the individuals working for and running these outlets may have personal goals relating

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,840
to their own career advancement, or bringing social justice into gaming or whatever, the

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,320
top prize is still ultimately influence with the big boys.

59
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,760
When Gamergate came along and began exposing the corrupt behaviour of these outlets, it

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,180
lessened their influence, which is why it was in the best interest of these outlets

61
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,040
to try and discredit Gamergate by any means necessary, even going so far as to link IGN's

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,000
adoption of ethical policies to the idea that IGN is appeasing what they have publicly labelled

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
as a hate group.

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,760
In other words, these indie press outlets desire to discredit Gamergate so much that

65
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,640
they are willing to slander anybody who discusses ethics, whether they consider themselves to

66
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,400
be affiliated with Gamergate or not, as racists and misogynists.

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,360
Arbok says these indie press outlets were banking on the spectre of misogyny to be a

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,520
powerful enough scare that AAA developers would come out of the woodwork to admonish

69
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,960
Gamergate, and in doing so, they would be giving the indie press outlets the professional

70
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,000
influence they so desperately crave.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,280
However there are two big problems with their plan.

72
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,880
One, AAA developers largely don't share the same opinions with these journalists on

73
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,960
a personal level, they see their social justice warrior leanings as curtailing artistic freedom.

74
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,440
And two, AAA developers understood that the indie press outlets fucked up big time when

75
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,280
they chose to attack all gamers.

76
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,220
These outlets were willing to attack their own audience and tank their own businesses

77
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,920
as a calculated gamble to improve their own standing in the industry, but the AAA developers

78
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,320
aren't willing to follow them into that abyss.

79
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,360
But most importantly of all, Arbok theorizes that AAA developers have been largely silent

80
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,200
on Gamergate because they're willing to let Gamergate do the dirty work of taking out the indie

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,960
press that has been a thorn in their sides for over a decade.

82
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,960
The indie press outlets were an easy target for Gamergate because they are extremely incompetent

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,280
with their corruption, while corporate corruption by actual industry names is often significantly

84
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,880
more professional, and therefore harder to uncover.

85
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,360
Arbok directly says the AAAs and mouthpieces like IGN run a professional outlet.

86
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,200
Sure, it's all a big PR con job, but they aren't going to have journalists reviewing

87
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,640
games by people they're publicly friends with, and they eventually realize to cut out the

88
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,960
Doritos nonsense even if a bit too late.

89
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,680
He also says that the indie press journals were the low-hanging fruit.

90
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,440
Investigation into AAA corruption would take boots on the ground that Gamergate doesn't have.

91
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,040
This reality that Arbok describes actually forms what I consider to be the only legitimate

92
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,560
criticism anti-Gamergators have ever thrown at Gamergate.

93
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,400
And that criticism is this.

94
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,360
Gamergate only focuses on small-time corruption, for example like Zoe Quinn way back at the

95
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,160
beginning, not because she was corrupt, but because she's a woman and her corruption

96
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,920
offers misogynists a convenient excuse to harass her.

97
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,640
I have no doubt that this is the case for some people.

98
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:49,880
However, this criticism often leads anti-Gamergators to the next logical step, that Gamergate does

99
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,840
not actually care about corruption at all, because it has yet to tackle AAA corruption,

100
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,840
which is obviously much bigger.

101
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,280
Arbok's tweet longer offers the best reply to this.

102
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,420
It's not that Gamergate doesn't care, it's that Gamergate isn't big enough to do it.

103
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,500
Everybody over here hopes that Gamergate will one day grow large enough to tackle AAA corruption,

104
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,140
even if it would have to shed the Gamergate hashtag in order to get it done.

105
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,060
And even among AAA corruption, there's some obvious low-hanging fruit too.

106
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,000
Everybody knows about the Kane & Lynch Deadman controversy, but I'll give you a quick primer

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
right here.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,100
In 2007, Kane & Lynch came out.

109
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,100
It sucked.

110
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,220
Jeff Gerstmann, writing a review for GameSpot of the game, gave it a 6 out of 10, at the

111
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,660
same time as Eidos was paying GameSpot a ton of money to advertise the game.

112
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,300
Gerstmann was fired, and GameSpot refused to elaborate on it.

113
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,300
But nobody was fooled.

114
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,860
5 years later, after the non-disclosure agreement was up, Gerstmann confirmed what we all already

115
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,220
knew in an interview on Giant Bomb, that Eidos pressured GameSpot to fire him, and GameSpot

116
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,220
caved.

117
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,360
And, as a related aside, in our last video we brought up Geogrify performing consulting

118
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,680
for BioWare, EA, Microsoft Studios, and Ubisoft, while also simultaneously performing consulting

119
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,840
for the IGDA, stating that there may be a potential conflict of interest when the same

120
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,740
company performs consulting for the companies developers work for, and also the association

121
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,060
meant to stand up for the rights of said developers.

122
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,460
We also said that it probably wasn't a big deal, but our friend Derek Smart wasn't

123
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,460
so convinced.

124
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,760
He said there may actually be something to it, and he was going to look into it.

125
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,160
Haven't heard back from him yet, one way or the other, and I hope he decides to come

126
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,720
forward if he finds anything.

127
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,440
But when it comes to corruption, not all the happenings take place on our side of the Pacific.

128
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,840
Yeah, I'm talking about Japan.

129
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,140
Gamergate doesn't seem to focus too much on the Japanese gaming industry, presumably

130
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,660
because Gamergate is a primarily English-speaking movement without access to the non-English

131
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,660
scene.

132
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,420
Whenever gators do talk about Japan, it's almost always in reference to Mighty No. 9,

133
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,700
which is less of a corruption issue and more of a social justice issue.

134
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,260
Don't get me wrong, backers to Mighty No. 9 losing their privileges for supporting Gamergate

135
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,520
is corrupt, people paid money for a service and lost it due to their political stance.

136
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,060
But I hate to break it to you guys, but Dina pushing social justice views isn't corrupt,

137
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,740
it's just mind-numbingly stupid, and she ultimately got what was coming to her.

138
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,260
And then there's the mystical fabled Shenmue 3.

139
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,740
For those of you who don't know, during Sony's E3 conference this year, Shenmue 3 was shown

140
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,620
off along with a link to its Kickstarter.

141
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,800
This was unusual, because usually during an E3 conference, the games shown off are already

142
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,740
in development, usually by the company hosting the conference.

143
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,940
But for Shenmue 3, it was a short teaser and a link to the Kickstarter.

144
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,820
Kickstarter was knocked offline immediately, and Shenmue 3 got its requested 2 million

145
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,160
bucks in about 24 hours.

146
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,380
That seems like a lot of money, and it did break some Kickstarter records until you realize

147
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,840
that Shenmue 1 cost between 47 million and 70 million dollars to develop.

148
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,600
When you adjust that for inflation, that's 99 million.

149
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,120
To contrast, Witcher 3's budget was 25 million.

150
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,200
And even without doing the math, I think it's pretty obvious that Sony has a vested interest

151
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,520
in seeing Shenmue 3 come out, and will be funding it themselves to that end.

152
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,640
This was directly confirmed by Yu Suzuki, Shenmue's director, on a post on the Kickstarter,

153
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,080
saying that both Sony and Shibuya Productions will be funding Shenmue 3.

154
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,320
So what's the Kickstarter for?

155
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
Just to drum up hype?

156
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,480
To pad somebody's pockets with a bit of extra cash?

157
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,800
As of recording this, the Kickstarter is at 4.1 million bucks.

158
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,000
Assume for a minute, Shenmue 3 didn't have a Kickstarter, and Sony just announced it

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
at E3.

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,120
You don't think Sony couldn't pony up an extra 4.1 million?

161
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,560
It's good that Suzuki came out and clarified things.

162
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,380
That sort of transparency is something we need to see more of, not less.

163
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,060
But there's a major problem with the way Kickstarter is heading.

164
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,280
It used to be a platform for people who couldn't fund their projects to get things off the

165
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
ground.

166
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,980
It's just a place for big names to hype up their next project.

167
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,040
Kind of like the IGF, now that I think of it.

168
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,480
But oh wait, we're not done with Japan just yet.

169
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,920
Let's take a peek at the Japanese indie scene.

170
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,020
In 2013, James Melk, or Mielk, I can't pronounce it, an employee at the Japanese developer

171
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,540
Q Games, started up BitSummit, a convention for Japanese indies to get together and showcase

172
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,540
their games.

173
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,480
Polygon ran an article discussing the details of BitSummit's beginnings.

174
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,760
In 2014, during the second BitSummit, they decided to give out awards to the best indie

175
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
games at the show.

176
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,760
Sounds pretty familiar so far, right?

177
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,520
Well, on BitSummit's own page, five development studios are stated to be the backers behind

178
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
BitSummit.

179
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,520
They are Q Games, Vitai, 17-Bit, Pygmy Studio, and O2 Inc.

180
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,280
Now anybody who knows about Q Games knows that it's not really an indie studio.

181
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,420
It's made multiple first and second party games with both Sony and Nintendo, most notably

182
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,680
Star Fox Command and Star Fox 64 3D.

183
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,120
This is important because Q Games president, Dylan Cuthbert, programmed the original Star

184
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,040
Fox on the Super Nintendo when he was just 17 years old.

185
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,560
The point is, these guys aren't indies.

186
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,400
Cuthbert married Miyamoto's daughter for fuck's sake, he's not an indie.

187
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,600
Let's take a look at the second studio on the list of the five BitSummit backers, Vitai.

188
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,800
On an old background page only accessible by the internet wayback machine, Vitai is

189
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,760
described as being founded in 2002 by Giles Goddard, who has been an important figure

190
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,040
in the Japanese games industry since 1990 when he moved to Kyoto to program Star Fox

191
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,320
for the SNES.

192
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,760
For many years he worked at Nintendo on a variety of key franchises, including Stunt

193
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,680
Race FX, Super Mario 64, and Tinnitus Snowboarding.

194
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,360
It's likely that Goddard and Cuthbert are old friends due to their time spent working

195
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,640
on Star Fox together.

196
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,120
And clearly, Goddard isn't really all that indie either.

197
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,080
He went out and founded his own studio, sure, but he's still got his old connections and

198
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
everything.

199
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,600
Hell, the website boasts that Vitai works closely with Nintendo to create games such

200
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,800
as Steel Diver, which was produced in close coordination with Shigeru Miyamoto.

201
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,480
So again, not indie.

202
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,360
But this is all okay so far.

203
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,680
These guys are heading up BitSummit, they don't necessarily have to be indie themselves.

204
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,200
Except that, the modern zombie taxi driver, a game by Vitai, won the Vermillion Gate award

205
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,700
at BitSummit 2014, Vermillion Gate basically being BitSummit's best of show.

206
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,440
Are you fucking kidding me?

207
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,680
Not only is Vitai not an indie studio by any stretch of the imagination, what with their

208
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,200
buddy buddying it up with Nintendo, but Vitai is a fucking backer of BitSummit.

209
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,440
Vitai helps support and organize an award show, and then wins an award at that very

210
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,040
same show, while another of the backers, Q Games, is run by a personal friend of Vitai's

211
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
director.

212
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
That's just awesome.

213
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,120
Is there just something about the term indie that makes it an incestuous circlejerk no

214
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,520
matter what language it's in?

215
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,160
I actually thought the Japanese scene would have been free of this shit, but no, I guess

216
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,600
it's the same everywhere you go.

217
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,400
Ah, let's just cover all our bases here, let's look at the other three backers.

218
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,400
17bit, run by Jake Cazdel, his resume includes working at EA, working at Sega where he helped

219
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,240
make Rez and Space Channel 5, and working on Illusion of Gaia, as well as a number of

220
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,720
unnamed N64 games.

221
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,600
It's the same situation as with Goddard at Vitai and Cuthbert at Q Games.

222
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,000
The might have started their own studios, but they've still got all their old connections

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and friendships.

224
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They're not indies.

225
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,560
Wait, wait, wait.

226
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,480
We are a Seattle-based independent developer?

227
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,640
You're not even over there and you have your thumbs in BitSummit?

228
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,840
Pygmy Studios and O2 Inc seem to be legit enough.

229
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,880
At the very least they're fucking Japanese.

230
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,120
Let's take a peek at the other awards winners.

231
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,680
Lots of Japanese text.

232
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,160
Something to be expected at a Japanese awards show.

233
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,320
Hold on.

234
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,440
Funkatronic Labs, Nova 11, won second place for Game Design and runner up for Vermillion

235
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Gate.

236
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,080
Let's take a peek at their about page.

237
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,880
Pasadena, California?

238
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,760
These guys aren't even a Japanese indie dev.

239
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,280
Is this sort of like how one of Zoe Quinn's games won in IGF China, even though I doubt

240
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,420
Zoe's ever actually stepped foot in the Glorious Motherland?

241
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,880
This video is over two months late, and the primary reason for that is because Camry Lady

242
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,600
wanted to tackle the triple A's.

243
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,240
And she did a lot of digging.

244
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,400
But the cold heart truth is, you can only do so much being an armchair detective.

245
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,480
David Arbok was pretty spot on when he said that triple A corruption isn't sloppy and

246
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,760
stupid the way indie corruption is.

247
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,960
Obama spent a ton of time overturning every rock, tapping every resources, asking questions

248
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,600
in private, and ultimately even traveling down to Toronto to meet with an old high school

249
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,600
friend, who by random chance is currently married to a small time Japanese indie dev,

250
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,640
and we're in Canada to visit her family.

251
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,200
He told her that the Japanese indie scene was just as bullshit as the English one, and

252
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,360
directed her towards BitSummit.

253
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,480
And really, for all of her efforts, this is the most she could get.

254
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,080
That said, Nintendo is a tertiary party in the same corrupt bullshit in the Japanese

255
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,900
indie scene that we're all used to hearing about by now.

256
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,240
In my opinion, no one at Nintendo themselves even seems to be guilty of anything.

257
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,760
It's all just former Nintendo employees thinking they can put on the indie hat while

258
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,400
keeping all of their old connections, and act like kings of the shitpile.

259
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,800
Does this mean that when it comes to triple A corruption, Gamegate is completely outmatched

260
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
and useless?

261
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,520
Well, no, I don't think it does.

262
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,520
People have remarked that Gamegate has shifted focus from being an angry mob and into a vigilant

263
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,680
watchdog, and the truth is, that is the only way that triple A corruption is ever going

264
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,680
to be routed.

265
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,920
Remember when the Xbox One got completely shit on with its mandatory Kinect and its

266
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,060
always-on functionality, and the arrogance to the point of the people at Microsoft telling

267
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,360
consumers to buy an Xbox 360 if they wanted a console that wasn't always on?

268
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,040
Remember how they got their shit royally kicked in for it?

269
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,920
That's ultimately who we are.

270
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,940
As Gamegaters, and as gamers.

271
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:03,080
If you think someone's being corrupt, whether it's with reviews, or DRM, or bullshit

272
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,240
DLC in microtransactions, or whatever, all you need to do is talk about it.

273
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,840
We're all aware of the shit they try to pull now, and we have the tools to get the

274
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
word out.

275
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,000
This isn't directly related, but Reddit is burning right now, because everybody is

276
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,300
hyper aware of what all of these shitheads are trying to slip by under our noses.

277
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,040
We keep them alive, and we've also become their most dangerous enemy, an informed consumer

278
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
base.

279
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,100
Arbok was right when he said that the triple A's are content to let us deal with their

280
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,000
journal problem for them, and honestly we are content to do it, but we're also keeping

281
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,420
a very close eye on you triple A's.

282
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,420
YouTubers are far less likely to gloss over a game's obvious problems than a reviewer

283
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,420
is.

284
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,300
Sup guys, here's a bit of an after video special.

285
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,560
I'm really sorry it took us so long to get this one out, but it happened pretty much

286
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
like I said.

287
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,820
Cam spent a lot of time investigating, and unfortunately just didn't dig up much to

288
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,820
show for it.

289
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,080
The only way we're ever going to get conclusive proof of triple A corruption is either from

290
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,920
the inside, or something stupidly public like Kane & Lynch happens again.

291
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,720
I'm still holding out hope that developers will feel free to speak to us or others, even

292
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
anonymously.

293
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,840
I also plan to release a video discussing the future of the Indefensible series, and

294
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,320
other happenings on the Short Fighter Taku channel sometime tomorrow, so please come

295
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,400
back and check that out.

296
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,000
But basically, regardless of the reasoning behind it, the wait between this video and

297
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,760
the last one was just unacceptably long, especially since a regular update to this series was

298
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,800
promised as a Patreon goal.

299
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,240
I mean, you guys gave us money, and for the past two months we've failed to come through

300
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
with the goods.

301
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,640
There's really no excuse for that, and we do have other videos coming in short order

302
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,360
to rectify the situation.

303
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,280
I've seen what kind of people exploit Patreon by promising goals and not following through,

304
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,880
and we've all agreed that we need to actually keep up with the videos y'all are here for,

305
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,480
or just shut the Patreon down.

306
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,120
And we choose option one.

307
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:55,560
So this is our formal apology to you, our viewers, but with the lack of content, and

308
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,400
you will see the next Indefensible very soon.

309
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:05,600
And speaking of Patreon, a very special thanks to Rex, James Knotz, Smitho, Samuel Dillon,

310
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:14,640
Murray, BigBoss79, Pharmacist, Garrison James Hamilton, Berto Elcon, Simon Kvam, Hente Logic,

311
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,200
Pasquale Festa, and anybody else who contributes anonymously.

312
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,040
Any amount helps, and you guys are amazing.

313
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,200
We've put your money to good use, buying new equipment that our show desperately needs.

314
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:31,160
If you want to support the show, the Patreon address is www.patreon.com slash shortfireotaku.

315
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,840
Or if you'd rather do a one-time thing, our paypal's at shortfireotaku at hotmail.com.

316
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,720
We post receipts and vlogs about the equipment we buy, so you'll always know your money is

317
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,320
going towards our videos and our channel.

318
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,840
And of course, don't feel pressured to give or anything.

319
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,920
You'll always be welcome whether you give or not.

320
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,200
If you want to see more of us, me and my roommate Dave play video games twice a day on this

321
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,480
channel, and we're actually starting up a new round of games right now if you want to

322
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
jump on board with a fresh run of something.

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,120
We're also doing anime reviews again finally too, with the most recent review just coming

325
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,680
And well, if you're only here to listen to me talk about Gamergate, come back for my update

326
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,200

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,880
Wherever you see me, I'll see you there.
