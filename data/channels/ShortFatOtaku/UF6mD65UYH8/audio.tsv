0	10580	A verified account is, you'd think, one in which the account owner is verified to
10580	13020	actually be the person they appear to be.
13020	16260	That was the original purpose of them on Twitter, where the concept originated.
16260	19580	If you're a public figure, you're likely to have parody accounts making jokes in your
19580	24340	name, or scammers or bots, and so, once you prove that you're you, you got a little
24340	26020	checkmark beside your name.
26020	27580	Other websites do something similar.
27580	31680	On YouTube, you automatically get a checkmark after you hit 100,000 subscribers.
31680	36480	On TikTok, anybody can apply for verification, but it's granted on a case-by-case basis.
36480	40880	On Facebook, everybody has to provide government ID for a new personal account now, if your
40880	42800	account name looks suspicious.
42800	47320	In fact, all of these sites and more have been moving away from the just-sign-up model,
47320	49360	requiring phone numbers to even use them.
49360	53920	I've never liked this trend of merging your online and offline life excessively, something
53920	55880	I've spoken about on this channel multiple times.
55880	59220	I get it if you need to figure out if people actually deserve verification, but for just
59220	63760	some random person signing up for a new burner account, it seems like way too much overreach
63760	64860	for my liking.
64860	69420	The issue is, at some point, verification on Twitter stopped being for people who were
69420	72400	notable public figures at risk of impersonation.
72400	76660	They were just that on Twitter for seven years, from the pilot program's introduction in
76660	79080	2009 up until 2016.
79080	80900	But that's when the trouble began.
80900	86800	On January 8, 2016, British journalist and Gamergate-era provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos
86800	91180	tweeted a screenshot of an email from Twitter informing him that his verification badge
91180	95060	had been removed due to recent violations of Twitter rules.
95060	98900	Milo claimed that Twitter didn't tell him which rule he had violated, and it was his
98900	102940	belief that it was because he was a popular, right-leaning media figure.
102940	106880	Twitter executive Nathan Hubbard, making clear that he wasn't speaking on behalf of the
106880	110540	company, offered the suggestion that it was due to this tweet where Milo said to another
110540	112940	user that he deserved to be harassed.
112940	118140	Milo countered this claim by saying that deserved to be harassed was an in-joke between conservatives,
118140	119780	and that Twitter is moronic.
119780	123900	Now as an old fag myself, when I began to research this topic, I was surprised that
123900	128100	this is considered the official history as to why Milo got de-verified, because man,
128100	130540	I was there, and that isn't the reason.
130540	131540	That isn't what happened.
131540	135580	What actually happened, I remember it well, is that Milo changed his profile to describe
135580	141340	his job title as Buzzfeed's Social Justice Editor, considering that, at this time, the
141340	145340	verification badge was used to declare that a person was actually the public figure they
145340	146340	said they were.
146340	151140	The fact that Milo was jokingly claiming a job title that wasn't his meant that the verification
151140	155200	badge was Twitter backing up that mistaken claim, therefore it was pretty reasonable
155200	156200	to remove it.
156200	159780	And, of course, Milo would claim that it was because of his political beliefs that he got
159780	164260	de-verified, rather than the actual reason, because their social clout in being a victim.
164260	167980	He did the same thing when he got banned a few months later for calling the Ghostbusters
167980	173500	2016 black actress Leslie Jones a black dude and barely literate.
173500	176960	Regardless of whether or not you believe this kind of banter should be a punishable offense
176960	180940	on social media, I personally believe it shouldn't be, though it makes Milo an asshole.
180940	183260	It clearly didn't happen for political reasons.
183260	187540	The next wave of de-verifications in 2017, though, did seem to be done for political
187540	188540	reasons.
188540	192700	Both the American white supremacist Richard Spencer and the British nationalist Tommy
192700	197160	Robinson were de-verified on Twitter, along with a slew of other smaller accounts that
197160	201180	espouse political views significantly to the right of the online Overton window.
201180	204380	It's also in 2017 that another trend started to pick up.
204380	208420	People actually started to get big on Twitter being reply guys to Donald Trump.
208420	211900	Trump was in the first year of his presidency at the time, and he hadn't gone completely
211900	216460	off the rails yet due to the massively addictive social media feedback loop that seemed to
216460	219040	have warped his perception of reality by 2020.
219040	223480	But there were a ton of progressives who had already been thoroughly mind-fucked by Hillary's
223480	227160	2016 loss, coping under every single tweet Trump made.
227160	230720	I really want to hammer this point home to you guys, if you weren't really around back
230720	232200	during this time.
232200	237440	Entire journalist and influencer careers were created by having a hot take under Trump's
237440	238440	tweets.
238440	242220	Most notably is the account of Jeff Tiedrich, originally only known as the father of the
242220	248900	awkward zombie chick, whose recently unverified Twitter account now sits at 1.1 million followers.
248900	253380	He built this platform by being one of the first to reply to Trump every single time,
253380	258140	and considering how quick he was to the ball, day or night, 24-7, it's not a huge leap
258140	262700	to say he has the most terminal case of Trump derangement syndrome ever witnessed.
262700	266880	For the first few years of Trump's presidency, you could basically expect the same pattern
266880	269080	to play out whenever he hit Twitter.
269080	273540	Any time Trump announced anything, good news or bad, red meat for Republicans, or stuff
273540	277820	even the most die-hard lefty could support, his replies were flooded with verified Twitter
277820	282060	accounts all clamoring to farm clout and build up their presence online.
282060	286700	As a result of this phenomenon, the phrase blue checkmark or blue check became a shorthand
286700	291040	used by average people to refer to verified accounts that regularly give the most garbage
291040	292620	takes imaginable.
292620	296820	As a result, to most normies, getting verified was actually a mark against you, while to
296820	301100	those people who were actually verified, it continued to be viewed as a status symbol.
301100	305260	This growing divide became entrenched, with the plebs creating various blue check memes
305260	309300	and laughing at the verifieds, while the verifieds continued to act as a weird internet
309300	312420	quasi-nobility looking down upon their followers.
312420	316180	But as soon as it hit their ears that their status symbol was considered a mark of mockery,
316180	317300	they struck back.
317300	319260	Yes, actually.
319260	321460	Verified is now a derogatory term on Twitter.
321460	325420	Somehow, becoming verified is synonymous with being a liberal elitist.
325420	329180	Imagine how much copium you have to huff to actually write this article.
329180	333700	What's happening here is that the verified class actually took their blue checkmarks
333700	334900	very seriously.
334900	336580	They considered it a mark of distinction.
336580	338540	They earned it by somehow being notable.
338540	342040	And of course following the correct political views, because after the de-verification of
342040	345760	Tommy Robinson and Richard Spencer, the shackles were basically off in terms of stripping that
345760	349000	seal of approval from anybody who didn't toe the progressive political line.
349000	352620	For some of these people, they were in fact notable, like actors or musicians or government
352620	353620	officials.
353620	356520	For others, they were online influencers, whether that be through actually creating
356520	360500	something on YouTube or Twitch, or just getting well known underneath Trump's tweets like
360500	361660	Jeff Tiedrich.
361660	364820	And yet for others, they had dead or nearly dead accounts.
364820	366540	No followers, no engagement.
366540	370140	But they were journalists working for progressive news organizations, and Twitter wanted to
370140	374140	show that whatever they posted could be trusted as having journalistic integrity.
374140	378060	Especially when Sean Davis wanted to search for mommy melky porn on Twitter and accidentally
378060	379060	tweeted it.
379060	381980	We all just had to know that that was officially coming from him.
381980	386140	So if you were somebody who made fun of people who took their verified status too seriously,
386140	390600	if you used the phrase blue check as a pejorative, you were one of those nails that had to be
390600	391600	hammered down.
391640	393360	Or the pleb who was getting a bit too uppity.
393360	398080	There's a huge overlap between this concept and the idea that journalists are alongside
398080	402560	racial or sexual minorities as being a protected class, something that I covered a few years
402560	403560	ago.
403560	406540	What's going on here is that these people believe that their work is so important it
406540	411000	needs to be amplified and given all the weight of the platform as an authoritative source.
411000	413560	But it's not like these people are reporting on Vietnam or some shit.
413560	416000	They're not even claiming to be objective anymore.
416000	420000	A Washington Post Opinions columnist, who's writing about the intersectional transphobia
420000	425080	of her yoga class from the comfort of her downtown high-rise cosmopolitan $5,000 a month
425080	429120	apartment, sipping on her Starbucks and feeding her collection of cats while wondering why
429120	433800	she can no longer bag hot young guys at the bar as a 38-year-old drunk off her ass on
433800	438840	a box of wine she pre-drank at her equally vapid friend's house, which she later projectile
438840	443520	vomited into the disgusting cum-covered toilet of said club's shitter before stumbling
443520	448280	home all the while recording a video for TikTok about how all men are misogynist because none
448280	452660	of them want to fuck her anymore and denying her sex as it involves males weaponizing their
452660	456880	power against her right to get laid is not the same thing as an actual journalist who
456880	459400	does respectable, important reporting.
459400	461320	This was the paradigm for a long time.
461320	465060	Verified Twitter users acting superior, plebs pushing them off their high horse, people
465060	467800	desperate for clout, scrabbling to get that blue check.
467800	470360	And it all changed once Elon Musk took over.
470360	474800	Elon announced last year that while government officials would gain a grey checkmark to denote
474800	478740	their status, the blue check would become the Twitter blue program, where anybody could
478740	481160	buy the blue checkmark for $8 a month.
481160	484200	If eight sounds like a strange number, that's because it's actually the result of a weird
484200	486760	back and forth between Elon and Stephen King.
486760	490400	King tweeted, angry at the indignation that he'd have to pay for his verification, $20
490400	491880	a month to keep my blue check?
491880	493480	Fuck that, they should pay me.
493480	496000	If that gets instituted, I'm gone like Enron.
496000	498680	Elon simply replied, we need to pay the bills somehow.
498680	500420	Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers.
500420	501780	How about $8?
501780	506660	This exchange went viral because the idea of haggling over a blue check was just peak
506660	510140	2022, and that memetic $8 number stuck.
510140	513980	As a result of the change, we saw a few very interesting effects.
513980	518780	Firstly, a lot of low-level journos, has-beens, and other relatively unimportant people lost
518780	520740	their grandfathered blue checks.
520740	524320	It seemed like for a while, Twitter was going to add a separate status for people who used
524320	528380	to have the old blue check, some kind of legacy verification, but that only stuck around for
528380	529380	a couple months.
529380	531260	And at the time of recording, it's since vanished.
531740	536020	But those people who lost their verified status and were left naked, out in the cold, defrocked,
536020	537800	they threw an absolute fit.
537800	541300	Look at how quickly they melt down the second those credentials are stripped.
541300	544660	Remember, these people desperately wanted that blue badge.
544660	546900	They based their personality off of it.
546900	547900	I'm not joking.
547900	551840	If you live in San Francisco, you can get a blue check on your house if you're verified
551840	552840	online.
552840	553840	Seriously.
553840	557100	Yeah, this began as a meme, but the artist who made it actually started offering it as
557100	562180	a real service after it went viral and she was told just how many people in the Bay Area
562180	563720	actually wanted it.
563720	568080	Imagine getting a verified blue check mark put on the front of your house, guys.
568080	571700	It's basically a public display that you're an asshole and an invitation for robbers to
571700	573240	come take all your stuff.
573240	577860	The second effect was that celebrities who had the blue check but lost it began to beg
577860	580420	Elon Musk and Twitter to have it back.
580420	584120	Kim Kardashian wanted her blue check mark back, but she didn't want to pay for it.
584120	589080	This bitch spent $36,000 in a purse but can't do $8 a month?
589080	590380	Same thing with Charlie Sheen.
590380	594440	He made $1.8 million every episode of Two and a Half Men.
594440	596100	What is this e-begging shit?
596100	600580	The third effect was seeing celebrities who do have the blue check fervently claim that
600580	604020	they're not paying for it, that it was actually grandfathered in or it's some kind of glitch
604020	605020	or something.
605020	608220	They would never pay the hateful Elon Musk for a Twitter status symbol.
608220	612960	Of course, many of them had no problem paying Twitter up to $15,000 for their old blue check
612960	615060	mark under the previous ownership.
615060	618940	These people are actual filth, the terror they all display, that their comrades will
618940	623500	destroy them for displaying the symbol that they coveted so deeply just a few days ago.
623500	626940	Elon really did expose these creatures to the sunlight.
626940	630780	If you want to see this turned up to 11, look at the meltdown of the various de-verified
630780	632500	news organizations.
632500	636460	Here's the New York Times saying that they won't pay the $8 for the verified check, which
636460	642100	I guess is technically not a lie because instead of paying $8 for a blue check, they paid $1,000
642240	643240	for a gold check.
643240	649040	Yes, you can buy a gold verified check mark for $1,000 a month, though that service is
649040	651600	specifically meant for private organizations.
651600	653080	Here's what's underneath all of this.
653080	656560	The celebrities, the actors, the journalists and elites, they're not mad that the blue
656560	657880	check costs money.
657880	662920	If it costs $10,000 a month, they would gladly pay for a badge of exclusivity.
662920	665860	They're mad that it costs an amount of money that you can afford.
665860	669120	So if a peasant can afford it, they believe that they should get it for free and they
669120	672860	have to make it very clear that you and them are not the same.
672860	673940	You paid for it.
673940	676500	They received it as a gift for being them.
676500	680380	Whether or not that's actually true, the appearance of status is what's important here.
680380	684340	The latest piece of the story is that verified accounts get boosted in the algorithm, meaning
684340	688040	that if you pay the $8 a month or you have a check mark through some other method, more
688040	689040	people will see your tweets.
689040	691980	I don't know if this is a good or a bad move, we'll have to wait and see.
691980	694960	But personally, I don't care too much because Twitter's a shithole anyway.
694960	698440	The issue I have with this whole thing is before Twitter started de-verifying people
698440	701240	for wrongthink, it was actually a good system.
701240	702500	Verification is important.
702500	705700	Not so that you know what the correct thing to think is, which is how a lot of proggs
705700	706700	use the system.
706700	710100	I think at least a small part of why people make fun of fact checkers and debunkers is
710100	711920	due to the blue check phenomenon too.
711920	715700	But it's actually important so that you can tell what a person or organization's official
715700	717300	stance on a topic is.
717300	720520	I remember a Twitter account that was meant to look like an official Twitch page, stating
720520	724540	that Twitch had relented on the ad revenue split at the height of that controversy.
724540	727940	It's a funny troll, but people quickly tuned in to the fact that it was a troll because
727940	730800	the parody account didn't have a verified checkmark.
730800	734360	Of course, verification doesn't mean that messages from official accounts are always
734360	735360	trustworthy.
735360	739000	Remember the great Twitter hack of 2020, where a bunch of prominent verified Twitter accounts
739000	741180	were giving out Bitcoin scam links?
741180	745640	A blue check won't stop you from getting hacked after you open that spam email like a moron.
745640	748560	But for the most part, Twitter verification before worked.
748560	751660	Once it became less about verifying that the person you're talking to is actually who they
751660	755460	claim to be, and instead is somebody that promotes views that Twitter considers to be
755460	758180	the truth, the entire system stopped working.
758180	762460	Its collapse into a forepay status symbol was basically inevitable at that point, once
762460	764500	the right owner of Twitter came around.
764500	768980	To somebody as diehard capitalist as Elon Musk, there's no reason that what Twitter
768980	773380	considers to be the truth wouldn't morph into whoever paid Twitter for the status.
773380	778300	That's not to say that I think that paying $8 a month for a blue checkmark is a bad idea.
778300	779300	It's not.
779300	781260	Like Elon said, you gotta pay the bills somehow.
781260	785300	In my opinion, there should be some type of badge, like the original verification,
785300	789220	meant only for notable people who need to show that they are who they say they are,
789220	792400	without prejudice in regards to what type of content they post.
792400	796060	There's no reason that your Twitter account can't have multiple ranks or badges on it.
796060	799260	Twitch does it, Discord does it, but I have a feeling that that door might be closed at
799260	800260	this point.
800260	804180	Oh well, it's still a lot of fun to watch the people addicted to Twitter wail and gnash
804180	806220	their teeth over a tiny blue check.
