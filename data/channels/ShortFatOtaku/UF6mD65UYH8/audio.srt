1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,580
A verified account is, you'd think, one in which the account owner is verified to

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,020
actually be the person they appear to be.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,260
That was the original purpose of them on Twitter, where the concept originated.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,580
If you're a public figure, you're likely to have parody accounts making jokes in your

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,340
name, or scammers or bots, and so, once you prove that you're you, you got a little

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,020
checkmark beside your name.

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,580
Other websites do something similar.

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,680
On YouTube, you automatically get a checkmark after you hit 100,000 subscribers.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,480
On TikTok, anybody can apply for verification, but it's granted on a case-by-case basis.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,880
On Facebook, everybody has to provide government ID for a new personal account now, if your

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,800
account name looks suspicious.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,320
In fact, all of these sites and more have been moving away from the just-sign-up model,

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,360
requiring phone numbers to even use them.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,920
I've never liked this trend of merging your online and offline life excessively, something

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,880
I've spoken about on this channel multiple times.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,220
I get it if you need to figure out if people actually deserve verification, but for just

17
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,760
some random person signing up for a new burner account, it seems like way too much overreach

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,860
for my liking.

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,420
The issue is, at some point, verification on Twitter stopped being for people who were

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,400
notable public figures at risk of impersonation.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,660
They were just that on Twitter for seven years, from the pilot program's introduction in

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,080
2009 up until 2016.

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,900
But that's when the trouble began.

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:26,800
On January 8, 2016, British journalist and Gamergate-era provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,180
tweeted a screenshot of an email from Twitter informing him that his verification badge

26
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,060
had been removed due to recent violations of Twitter rules.

27
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,900
Milo claimed that Twitter didn't tell him which rule he had violated, and it was his

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,940
belief that it was because he was a popular, right-leaning media figure.

29
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,880
Twitter executive Nathan Hubbard, making clear that he wasn't speaking on behalf of the

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,540
company, offered the suggestion that it was due to this tweet where Milo said to another

31
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,940
user that he deserved to be harassed.

32
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:58,140
Milo countered this claim by saying that deserved to be harassed was an in-joke between conservatives,

33
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,780
and that Twitter is moronic.

34
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,900
Now as an old fag myself, when I began to research this topic, I was surprised that

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,100
this is considered the official history as to why Milo got de-verified, because man,

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,540
I was there, and that isn't the reason.

37
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,540
That isn't what happened.

38
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,580
What actually happened, I remember it well, is that Milo changed his profile to describe

39
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:21,340
his job title as Buzzfeed's Social Justice Editor, considering that, at this time, the

40
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,340
verification badge was used to declare that a person was actually the public figure they

41
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,340
said they were.

42
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,140
The fact that Milo was jokingly claiming a job title that wasn't his meant that the verification

43
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,200
badge was Twitter backing up that mistaken claim, therefore it was pretty reasonable

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
to remove it.

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,780
And, of course, Milo would claim that it was because of his political beliefs that he got

46
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,260
de-verified, rather than the actual reason, because their social clout in being a victim.

47
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,980
He did the same thing when he got banned a few months later for calling the Ghostbusters

48
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:53,500
2016 black actress Leslie Jones a black dude and barely literate.

49
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,960
Regardless of whether or not you believe this kind of banter should be a punishable offense

50
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,940
on social media, I personally believe it shouldn't be, though it makes Milo an asshole.

51
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,260
It clearly didn't happen for political reasons.

52
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,540
The next wave of de-verifications in 2017, though, did seem to be done for political

53
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,540
reasons.

54
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,700
Both the American white supremacist Richard Spencer and the British nationalist Tommy

55
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,160
Robinson were de-verified on Twitter, along with a slew of other smaller accounts that

56
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,180
espouse political views significantly to the right of the online Overton window.

57
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,380
It's also in 2017 that another trend started to pick up.

58
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,420
People actually started to get big on Twitter being reply guys to Donald Trump.

59
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,900
Trump was in the first year of his presidency at the time, and he hadn't gone completely

60
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,460
off the rails yet due to the massively addictive social media feedback loop that seemed to

61
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,040
have warped his perception of reality by 2020.

62
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,480
But there were a ton of progressives who had already been thoroughly mind-fucked by Hillary's

63
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,160
2016 loss, coping under every single tweet Trump made.

64
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,720
I really want to hammer this point home to you guys, if you weren't really around back

65
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,200
during this time.

66
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,440
Entire journalist and influencer careers were created by having a hot take under Trump's

67
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
tweets.

68
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,220
Most notably is the account of Jeff Tiedrich, originally only known as the father of the

69
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,900
awkward zombie chick, whose recently unverified Twitter account now sits at 1.1 million followers.

70
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,380
He built this platform by being one of the first to reply to Trump every single time,

71
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,140
and considering how quick he was to the ball, day or night, 24-7, it's not a huge leap

72
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,700
to say he has the most terminal case of Trump derangement syndrome ever witnessed.

73
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,880
For the first few years of Trump's presidency, you could basically expect the same pattern

74
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,080
to play out whenever he hit Twitter.

75
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,540
Any time Trump announced anything, good news or bad, red meat for Republicans, or stuff

76
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,820
even the most die-hard lefty could support, his replies were flooded with verified Twitter

77
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:42,060
accounts all clamoring to farm clout and build up their presence online.

78
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,700
As a result of this phenomenon, the phrase blue checkmark or blue check became a shorthand

79
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,040
used by average people to refer to verified accounts that regularly give the most garbage

80
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,620
takes imaginable.

81
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,820
As a result, to most normies, getting verified was actually a mark against you, while to

82
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,100
those people who were actually verified, it continued to be viewed as a status symbol.

83
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,260
This growing divide became entrenched, with the plebs creating various blue check memes

84
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,300
and laughing at the verifieds, while the verifieds continued to act as a weird internet

85
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,420
quasi-nobility looking down upon their followers.

86
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,180
But as soon as it hit their ears that their status symbol was considered a mark of mockery,

87
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,300
they struck back.

88
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,260
Yes, actually.

89
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,460
Verified is now a derogatory term on Twitter.

90
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,420
Somehow, becoming verified is synonymous with being a liberal elitist.

91
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,180
Imagine how much copium you have to huff to actually write this article.

92
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,700
What's happening here is that the verified class actually took their blue checkmarks

93
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,900
very seriously.

94
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,580
They considered it a mark of distinction.

95
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,540
They earned it by somehow being notable.

96
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,040
And of course following the correct political views, because after the de-verification of

97
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,760
Tommy Robinson and Richard Spencer, the shackles were basically off in terms of stripping that

98
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,000
seal of approval from anybody who didn't toe the progressive political line.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,620
For some of these people, they were in fact notable, like actors or musicians or government

100
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,620
officials.

101
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,520
For others, they were online influencers, whether that be through actually creating

102
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,500
something on YouTube or Twitch, or just getting well known underneath Trump's tweets like

103
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,660
Jeff Tiedrich.

104
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,820
And yet for others, they had dead or nearly dead accounts.

105
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,540
No followers, no engagement.

106
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,140
But they were journalists working for progressive news organizations, and Twitter wanted to

107
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,140
show that whatever they posted could be trusted as having journalistic integrity.

108
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,060
Especially when Sean Davis wanted to search for mommy melky porn on Twitter and accidentally

109
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,060
tweeted it.

110
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,980
We all just had to know that that was officially coming from him.

111
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,140
So if you were somebody who made fun of people who took their verified status too seriously,

112
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,600
if you used the phrase blue check as a pejorative, you were one of those nails that had to be

113
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
hammered down.

114
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,360
Or the pleb who was getting a bit too uppity.

115
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,080
There's a huge overlap between this concept and the idea that journalists are alongside

116
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,560
racial or sexual minorities as being a protected class, something that I covered a few years

117
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
ago.

118
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,540
What's going on here is that these people believe that their work is so important it

119
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,000
needs to be amplified and given all the weight of the platform as an authoritative source.

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,560
But it's not like these people are reporting on Vietnam or some shit.

121
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,000
They're not even claiming to be objective anymore.

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
A Washington Post Opinions columnist, who's writing about the intersectional transphobia

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,080
of her yoga class from the comfort of her downtown high-rise cosmopolitan $5,000 a month

124
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,120
apartment, sipping on her Starbucks and feeding her collection of cats while wondering why

125
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,800
she can no longer bag hot young guys at the bar as a 38-year-old drunk off her ass on

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,840
a box of wine she pre-drank at her equally vapid friend's house, which she later projectile

127
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,520
vomited into the disgusting cum-covered toilet of said club's shitter before stumbling

128
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,280
home all the while recording a video for TikTok about how all men are misogynist because none

129
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,660
of them want to fuck her anymore and denying her sex as it involves males weaponizing their

130
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,880
power against her right to get laid is not the same thing as an actual journalist who

131
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,400
does respectable, important reporting.

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,320
This was the paradigm for a long time.

133
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,060
Verified Twitter users acting superior, plebs pushing them off their high horse, people

134
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,800
desperate for clout, scrabbling to get that blue check.

135
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,360
And it all changed once Elon Musk took over.

136
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,800
Elon announced last year that while government officials would gain a grey checkmark to denote

137
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,740
their status, the blue check would become the Twitter blue program, where anybody could

138
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,160
buy the blue checkmark for $8 a month.

139
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,200
If eight sounds like a strange number, that's because it's actually the result of a weird

140
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,760
back and forth between Elon and Stephen King.

141
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,400
King tweeted, angry at the indignation that he'd have to pay for his verification, $20

142
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,880
a month to keep my blue check?

143
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,480
Fuck that, they should pay me.

144
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,000
If that gets instituted, I'm gone like Enron.

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,680
Elon simply replied, we need to pay the bills somehow.

146
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,420
Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers.

147
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,780
How about $8?

148
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,660
This exchange went viral because the idea of haggling over a blue check was just peak

149
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,140
2022, and that memetic $8 number stuck.

150
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,980
As a result of the change, we saw a few very interesting effects.

151
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,780
Firstly, a lot of low-level journos, has-beens, and other relatively unimportant people lost

152
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,740
their grandfathered blue checks.

153
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,320
It seemed like for a while, Twitter was going to add a separate status for people who used

154
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,380
to have the old blue check, some kind of legacy verification, but that only stuck around for

155
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,380
a couple months.

156
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,260
And at the time of recording, it's since vanished.

157
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,020
But those people who lost their verified status and were left naked, out in the cold, defrocked,

158
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,800
they threw an absolute fit.

159
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,300
Look at how quickly they melt down the second those credentials are stripped.

160
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,660
Remember, these people desperately wanted that blue badge.

161
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,900
They based their personality off of it.

162
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,900
I'm not joking.

163
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,840
If you live in San Francisco, you can get a blue check on your house if you're verified

164
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,840
online.

165
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Seriously.

166
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,100
Yeah, this began as a meme, but the artist who made it actually started offering it as

167
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,180
a real service after it went viral and she was told just how many people in the Bay Area

168
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,720
actually wanted it.

169
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,080
Imagine getting a verified blue check mark put on the front of your house, guys.

170
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,700
It's basically a public display that you're an asshole and an invitation for robbers to

171
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,240
come take all your stuff.

172
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,860
The second effect was that celebrities who had the blue check but lost it began to beg

173
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,420
Elon Musk and Twitter to have it back.

174
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,120
Kim Kardashian wanted her blue check mark back, but she didn't want to pay for it.

175
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,080
This bitch spent $36,000 in a purse but can't do $8 a month?

176
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,380
Same thing with Charlie Sheen.

177
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,440
He made $1.8 million every episode of Two and a Half Men.

178
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,100
What is this e-begging shit?

179
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,580
The third effect was seeing celebrities who do have the blue check fervently claim that

180
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,020
they're not paying for it, that it was actually grandfathered in or it's some kind of glitch

181
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,020
or something.

182
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,220
They would never pay the hateful Elon Musk for a Twitter status symbol.

183
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,960
Of course, many of them had no problem paying Twitter up to $15,000 for their old blue check

184
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,060
mark under the previous ownership.

185
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,940
These people are actual filth, the terror they all display, that their comrades will

186
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,500
destroy them for displaying the symbol that they coveted so deeply just a few days ago.

187
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,940
Elon really did expose these creatures to the sunlight.

188
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,780
If you want to see this turned up to 11, look at the meltdown of the various de-verified

189
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,500
news organizations.

190
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,460
Here's the New York Times saying that they won't pay the $8 for the verified check, which

191
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,100
I guess is technically not a lie because instead of paying $8 for a blue check, they paid $1,000

192
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
for a gold check.

193
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,040
Yes, you can buy a gold verified check mark for $1,000 a month, though that service is

194
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,600
specifically meant for private organizations.

195
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,080
Here's what's underneath all of this.

196
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,560
The celebrities, the actors, the journalists and elites, they're not mad that the blue

197
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,880
check costs money.

198
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,920
If it costs $10,000 a month, they would gladly pay for a badge of exclusivity.

199
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,860
They're mad that it costs an amount of money that you can afford.

200
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,120
So if a peasant can afford it, they believe that they should get it for free and they

201
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,860
have to make it very clear that you and them are not the same.

202
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,940
You paid for it.

203
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,500
They received it as a gift for being them.

204
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,380
Whether or not that's actually true, the appearance of status is what's important here.

205
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,340
The latest piece of the story is that verified accounts get boosted in the algorithm, meaning

206
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,040
that if you pay the $8 a month or you have a check mark through some other method, more

207
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
people will see your tweets.

208
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,980
I don't know if this is a good or a bad move, we'll have to wait and see.

209
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,960
But personally, I don't care too much because Twitter's a shithole anyway.

210
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,440
The issue I have with this whole thing is before Twitter started de-verifying people

211
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,240
for wrongthink, it was actually a good system.

212
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,500
Verification is important.

213
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,700
Not so that you know what the correct thing to think is, which is how a lot of proggs

214
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
use the system.

215
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,100
I think at least a small part of why people make fun of fact checkers and debunkers is

216
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,920
due to the blue check phenomenon too.

217
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,700
But it's actually important so that you can tell what a person or organization's official

218
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,300
stance on a topic is.

219
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,520
I remember a Twitter account that was meant to look like an official Twitch page, stating

220
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,540
that Twitch had relented on the ad revenue split at the height of that controversy.

221
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,940
It's a funny troll, but people quickly tuned in to the fact that it was a troll because

222
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,800
the parody account didn't have a verified checkmark.

223
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,360
Of course, verification doesn't mean that messages from official accounts are always

224
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
trustworthy.

225
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,000
Remember the great Twitter hack of 2020, where a bunch of prominent verified Twitter accounts

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,180
were giving out Bitcoin scam links?

227
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,640
A blue check won't stop you from getting hacked after you open that spam email like a moron.

228
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,560
But for the most part, Twitter verification before worked.

229
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,660
Once it became less about verifying that the person you're talking to is actually who they

230
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,460
claim to be, and instead is somebody that promotes views that Twitter considers to be

231
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,180
the truth, the entire system stopped working.

232
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,460
Its collapse into a forepay status symbol was basically inevitable at that point, once

233
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,500
the right owner of Twitter came around.

234
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,980
To somebody as diehard capitalist as Elon Musk, there's no reason that what Twitter

235
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,380
considers to be the truth wouldn't morph into whoever paid Twitter for the status.

236
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,300
That's not to say that I think that paying $8 a month for a blue checkmark is a bad idea.

237
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,300
It's not.

238
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,260
Like Elon said, you gotta pay the bills somehow.

239
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,300
In my opinion, there should be some type of badge, like the original verification,

240
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,220
meant only for notable people who need to show that they are who they say they are,

241
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,400
without prejudice in regards to what type of content they post.

242
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,060
There's no reason that your Twitter account can't have multiple ranks or badges on it.

243
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,260
Twitch does it, Discord does it, but I have a feeling that that door might be closed at

244
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,260
this point.

245
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,180
Oh well, it's still a lot of fun to watch the people addicted to Twitter wail and gnash

246
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,220
their teeth over a tiny blue check.
