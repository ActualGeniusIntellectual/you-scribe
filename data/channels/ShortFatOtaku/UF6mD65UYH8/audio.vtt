00:00.000 --> 00:10.580
A verified account is, you'd think, one in which the account owner is verified to

00:10.580 --> 00:13.020
actually be the person they appear to be.

00:13.020 --> 00:16.260
That was the original purpose of them on Twitter, where the concept originated.

00:16.260 --> 00:19.580
If you're a public figure, you're likely to have parody accounts making jokes in your

00:19.580 --> 00:24.340
name, or scammers or bots, and so, once you prove that you're you, you got a little

00:24.340 --> 00:26.020
checkmark beside your name.

00:26.020 --> 00:27.580
Other websites do something similar.

00:27.580 --> 00:31.680
On YouTube, you automatically get a checkmark after you hit 100,000 subscribers.

00:31.680 --> 00:36.480
On TikTok, anybody can apply for verification, but it's granted on a case-by-case basis.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.880
On Facebook, everybody has to provide government ID for a new personal account now, if your

00:40.880 --> 00:42.800
account name looks suspicious.

00:42.800 --> 00:47.320
In fact, all of these sites and more have been moving away from the just-sign-up model,

00:47.320 --> 00:49.360
requiring phone numbers to even use them.

00:49.360 --> 00:53.920
I've never liked this trend of merging your online and offline life excessively, something

00:53.920 --> 00:55.880
I've spoken about on this channel multiple times.

00:55.880 --> 00:59.220
I get it if you need to figure out if people actually deserve verification, but for just

00:59.220 --> 01:03.760
some random person signing up for a new burner account, it seems like way too much overreach

01:03.760 --> 01:04.860
for my liking.

01:04.860 --> 01:09.420
The issue is, at some point, verification on Twitter stopped being for people who were

01:09.420 --> 01:12.400
notable public figures at risk of impersonation.

01:12.400 --> 01:16.660
They were just that on Twitter for seven years, from the pilot program's introduction in

01:16.660 --> 01:19.080
2009 up until 2016.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.900
But that's when the trouble began.

01:20.900 --> 01:26.800
On January 8, 2016, British journalist and Gamergate-era provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos

01:26.800 --> 01:31.180
tweeted a screenshot of an email from Twitter informing him that his verification badge

01:31.180 --> 01:35.060
had been removed due to recent violations of Twitter rules.

01:35.060 --> 01:38.900
Milo claimed that Twitter didn't tell him which rule he had violated, and it was his

01:38.900 --> 01:42.940
belief that it was because he was a popular, right-leaning media figure.

01:42.940 --> 01:46.880
Twitter executive Nathan Hubbard, making clear that he wasn't speaking on behalf of the

01:46.880 --> 01:50.540
company, offered the suggestion that it was due to this tweet where Milo said to another

01:50.540 --> 01:52.940
user that he deserved to be harassed.

01:52.940 --> 01:58.140
Milo countered this claim by saying that deserved to be harassed was an in-joke between conservatives,

01:58.140 --> 01:59.780
and that Twitter is moronic.

01:59.780 --> 02:03.900
Now as an old fag myself, when I began to research this topic, I was surprised that

02:03.900 --> 02:08.100
this is considered the official history as to why Milo got de-verified, because man,

02:08.100 --> 02:10.540
I was there, and that isn't the reason.

02:10.540 --> 02:11.540
That isn't what happened.

02:11.540 --> 02:15.580
What actually happened, I remember it well, is that Milo changed his profile to describe

02:15.580 --> 02:21.340
his job title as Buzzfeed's Social Justice Editor, considering that, at this time, the

02:21.340 --> 02:25.340
verification badge was used to declare that a person was actually the public figure they

02:25.340 --> 02:26.340
said they were.

02:26.340 --> 02:31.140
The fact that Milo was jokingly claiming a job title that wasn't his meant that the verification

02:31.140 --> 02:35.200
badge was Twitter backing up that mistaken claim, therefore it was pretty reasonable

02:35.200 --> 02:36.200
to remove it.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.780
And, of course, Milo would claim that it was because of his political beliefs that he got

02:39.780 --> 02:44.260
de-verified, rather than the actual reason, because their social clout in being a victim.

02:44.260 --> 02:47.980
He did the same thing when he got banned a few months later for calling the Ghostbusters

02:47.980 --> 02:53.500
2016 black actress Leslie Jones a black dude and barely literate.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.960
Regardless of whether or not you believe this kind of banter should be a punishable offense

02:56.960 --> 03:00.940
on social media, I personally believe it shouldn't be, though it makes Milo an asshole.

03:00.940 --> 03:03.260
It clearly didn't happen for political reasons.

03:03.260 --> 03:07.540
The next wave of de-verifications in 2017, though, did seem to be done for political

03:07.540 --> 03:08.540
reasons.

03:08.540 --> 03:12.700
Both the American white supremacist Richard Spencer and the British nationalist Tommy

03:12.700 --> 03:17.160
Robinson were de-verified on Twitter, along with a slew of other smaller accounts that

03:17.160 --> 03:21.180
espouse political views significantly to the right of the online Overton window.

03:21.180 --> 03:24.380
It's also in 2017 that another trend started to pick up.

03:24.380 --> 03:28.420
People actually started to get big on Twitter being reply guys to Donald Trump.

03:28.420 --> 03:31.900
Trump was in the first year of his presidency at the time, and he hadn't gone completely

03:31.900 --> 03:36.460
off the rails yet due to the massively addictive social media feedback loop that seemed to

03:36.460 --> 03:39.040
have warped his perception of reality by 2020.

03:39.040 --> 03:43.480
But there were a ton of progressives who had already been thoroughly mind-fucked by Hillary's

03:43.480 --> 03:47.160
2016 loss, coping under every single tweet Trump made.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.720
I really want to hammer this point home to you guys, if you weren't really around back

03:50.720 --> 03:52.200
during this time.

03:52.200 --> 03:57.440
Entire journalist and influencer careers were created by having a hot take under Trump's

03:57.440 --> 03:58.440
tweets.

03:58.440 --> 04:02.220
Most notably is the account of Jeff Tiedrich, originally only known as the father of the

04:02.220 --> 04:08.900
awkward zombie chick, whose recently unverified Twitter account now sits at 1.1 million followers.

04:08.900 --> 04:13.380
He built this platform by being one of the first to reply to Trump every single time,

04:13.380 --> 04:18.140
and considering how quick he was to the ball, day or night, 24-7, it's not a huge leap

04:18.140 --> 04:22.700
to say he has the most terminal case of Trump derangement syndrome ever witnessed.

04:22.700 --> 04:26.880
For the first few years of Trump's presidency, you could basically expect the same pattern

04:26.880 --> 04:29.080
to play out whenever he hit Twitter.

04:29.080 --> 04:33.540
Any time Trump announced anything, good news or bad, red meat for Republicans, or stuff

04:33.540 --> 04:37.820
even the most die-hard lefty could support, his replies were flooded with verified Twitter

04:37.820 --> 04:42.060
accounts all clamoring to farm clout and build up their presence online.

04:42.060 --> 04:46.700
As a result of this phenomenon, the phrase blue checkmark or blue check became a shorthand

04:46.700 --> 04:51.040
used by average people to refer to verified accounts that regularly give the most garbage

04:51.040 --> 04:52.620
takes imaginable.

04:52.620 --> 04:56.820
As a result, to most normies, getting verified was actually a mark against you, while to

04:56.820 --> 05:01.100
those people who were actually verified, it continued to be viewed as a status symbol.

05:01.100 --> 05:05.260
This growing divide became entrenched, with the plebs creating various blue check memes

05:05.260 --> 05:09.300
and laughing at the verifieds, while the verifieds continued to act as a weird internet

05:09.300 --> 05:12.420
quasi-nobility looking down upon their followers.

05:12.420 --> 05:16.180
But as soon as it hit their ears that their status symbol was considered a mark of mockery,

05:16.180 --> 05:17.300
they struck back.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.260
Yes, actually.

05:19.260 --> 05:21.460
Verified is now a derogatory term on Twitter.

05:21.460 --> 05:25.420
Somehow, becoming verified is synonymous with being a liberal elitist.

05:25.420 --> 05:29.180
Imagine how much copium you have to huff to actually write this article.

05:29.180 --> 05:33.700
What's happening here is that the verified class actually took their blue checkmarks

05:33.700 --> 05:34.900
very seriously.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.580
They considered it a mark of distinction.

05:36.580 --> 05:38.540
They earned it by somehow being notable.

05:38.540 --> 05:42.040
And of course following the correct political views, because after the de-verification of

05:42.040 --> 05:45.760
Tommy Robinson and Richard Spencer, the shackles were basically off in terms of stripping that

05:45.760 --> 05:49.000
seal of approval from anybody who didn't toe the progressive political line.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.620
For some of these people, they were in fact notable, like actors or musicians or government

05:52.620 --> 05:53.620
officials.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.520
For others, they were online influencers, whether that be through actually creating

05:56.520 --> 06:00.500
something on YouTube or Twitch, or just getting well known underneath Trump's tweets like

06:00.500 --> 06:01.660
Jeff Tiedrich.

06:01.660 --> 06:04.820
And yet for others, they had dead or nearly dead accounts.

06:04.820 --> 06:06.540
No followers, no engagement.

06:06.540 --> 06:10.140
But they were journalists working for progressive news organizations, and Twitter wanted to

06:10.140 --> 06:14.140
show that whatever they posted could be trusted as having journalistic integrity.

06:14.140 --> 06:18.060
Especially when Sean Davis wanted to search for mommy melky porn on Twitter and accidentally

06:18.060 --> 06:19.060
tweeted it.

06:19.060 --> 06:21.980
We all just had to know that that was officially coming from him.

06:21.980 --> 06:26.140
So if you were somebody who made fun of people who took their verified status too seriously,

06:26.140 --> 06:30.600
if you used the phrase blue check as a pejorative, you were one of those nails that had to be

06:30.600 --> 06:31.600
hammered down.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.360
Or the pleb who was getting a bit too uppity.

06:33.360 --> 06:38.080
There's a huge overlap between this concept and the idea that journalists are alongside

06:38.080 --> 06:42.560
racial or sexual minorities as being a protected class, something that I covered a few years

06:42.560 --> 06:43.560
ago.

06:43.560 --> 06:46.540
What's going on here is that these people believe that their work is so important it

06:46.540 --> 06:51.000
needs to be amplified and given all the weight of the platform as an authoritative source.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.560
But it's not like these people are reporting on Vietnam or some shit.

06:53.560 --> 06:56.000
They're not even claiming to be objective anymore.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
A Washington Post Opinions columnist, who's writing about the intersectional transphobia

07:00.000 --> 07:05.080
of her yoga class from the comfort of her downtown high-rise cosmopolitan $5,000 a month

07:05.080 --> 07:09.120
apartment, sipping on her Starbucks and feeding her collection of cats while wondering why

07:09.120 --> 07:13.800
she can no longer bag hot young guys at the bar as a 38-year-old drunk off her ass on

07:13.800 --> 07:18.840
a box of wine she pre-drank at her equally vapid friend's house, which she later projectile

07:18.840 --> 07:23.520
vomited into the disgusting cum-covered toilet of said club's shitter before stumbling

07:23.520 --> 07:28.280
home all the while recording a video for TikTok about how all men are misogynist because none

07:28.280 --> 07:32.660
of them want to fuck her anymore and denying her sex as it involves males weaponizing their

07:32.660 --> 07:36.880
power against her right to get laid is not the same thing as an actual journalist who

07:36.880 --> 07:39.400
does respectable, important reporting.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.320
This was the paradigm for a long time.

07:41.320 --> 07:45.060
Verified Twitter users acting superior, plebs pushing them off their high horse, people

07:45.060 --> 07:47.800
desperate for clout, scrabbling to get that blue check.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.360
And it all changed once Elon Musk took over.

07:50.360 --> 07:54.800
Elon announced last year that while government officials would gain a grey checkmark to denote

07:54.800 --> 07:58.740
their status, the blue check would become the Twitter blue program, where anybody could

07:58.740 --> 08:01.160
buy the blue checkmark for $8 a month.

08:01.160 --> 08:04.200
If eight sounds like a strange number, that's because it's actually the result of a weird

08:04.200 --> 08:06.760
back and forth between Elon and Stephen King.

08:06.760 --> 08:10.400
King tweeted, angry at the indignation that he'd have to pay for his verification, $20

08:10.400 --> 08:11.880
a month to keep my blue check?

08:11.880 --> 08:13.480
Fuck that, they should pay me.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.000
If that gets instituted, I'm gone like Enron.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.680
Elon simply replied, we need to pay the bills somehow.

08:18.680 --> 08:20.420
Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers.

08:20.420 --> 08:21.780
How about $8?

08:21.780 --> 08:26.660
This exchange went viral because the idea of haggling over a blue check was just peak

08:26.660 --> 08:30.140
2022, and that memetic $8 number stuck.

08:30.140 --> 08:33.980
As a result of the change, we saw a few very interesting effects.

08:33.980 --> 08:38.780
Firstly, a lot of low-level journos, has-beens, and other relatively unimportant people lost

08:38.780 --> 08:40.740
their grandfathered blue checks.

08:40.740 --> 08:44.320
It seemed like for a while, Twitter was going to add a separate status for people who used

08:44.320 --> 08:48.380
to have the old blue check, some kind of legacy verification, but that only stuck around for

08:48.380 --> 08:49.380
a couple months.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.260
And at the time of recording, it's since vanished.

08:51.740 --> 08:56.020
But those people who lost their verified status and were left naked, out in the cold, defrocked,

08:56.020 --> 08:57.800
they threw an absolute fit.

08:57.800 --> 09:01.300
Look at how quickly they melt down the second those credentials are stripped.

09:01.300 --> 09:04.660
Remember, these people desperately wanted that blue badge.

09:04.660 --> 09:06.900
They based their personality off of it.

09:06.900 --> 09:07.900
I'm not joking.

09:07.900 --> 09:11.840
If you live in San Francisco, you can get a blue check on your house if you're verified

09:11.840 --> 09:12.840
online.

09:12.840 --> 09:13.840
Seriously.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.100
Yeah, this began as a meme, but the artist who made it actually started offering it as

09:17.100 --> 09:22.180
a real service after it went viral and she was told just how many people in the Bay Area

09:22.180 --> 09:23.720
actually wanted it.

09:23.720 --> 09:28.080
Imagine getting a verified blue check mark put on the front of your house, guys.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.700
It's basically a public display that you're an asshole and an invitation for robbers to

09:31.700 --> 09:33.240
come take all your stuff.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.860
The second effect was that celebrities who had the blue check but lost it began to beg

09:37.860 --> 09:40.420
Elon Musk and Twitter to have it back.

09:40.420 --> 09:44.120
Kim Kardashian wanted her blue check mark back, but she didn't want to pay for it.

09:44.120 --> 09:49.080
This bitch spent $36,000 in a purse but can't do $8 a month?

09:49.080 --> 09:50.380
Same thing with Charlie Sheen.

09:50.380 --> 09:54.440
He made $1.8 million every episode of Two and a Half Men.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.100
What is this e-begging shit?

09:56.100 --> 10:00.580
The third effect was seeing celebrities who do have the blue check fervently claim that

10:00.580 --> 10:04.020
they're not paying for it, that it was actually grandfathered in or it's some kind of glitch

10:04.020 --> 10:05.020
or something.

10:05.020 --> 10:08.220
They would never pay the hateful Elon Musk for a Twitter status symbol.

10:08.220 --> 10:12.960
Of course, many of them had no problem paying Twitter up to $15,000 for their old blue check

10:12.960 --> 10:15.060
mark under the previous ownership.

10:15.060 --> 10:18.940
These people are actual filth, the terror they all display, that their comrades will

10:18.940 --> 10:23.500
destroy them for displaying the symbol that they coveted so deeply just a few days ago.

10:23.500 --> 10:26.940
Elon really did expose these creatures to the sunlight.

10:26.940 --> 10:30.780
If you want to see this turned up to 11, look at the meltdown of the various de-verified

10:30.780 --> 10:32.500
news organizations.

10:32.500 --> 10:36.460
Here's the New York Times saying that they won't pay the $8 for the verified check, which

10:36.460 --> 10:42.100
I guess is technically not a lie because instead of paying $8 for a blue check, they paid $1,000

10:42.240 --> 10:43.240
for a gold check.

10:43.240 --> 10:49.040
Yes, you can buy a gold verified check mark for $1,000 a month, though that service is

10:49.040 --> 10:51.600
specifically meant for private organizations.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.080
Here's what's underneath all of this.

10:53.080 --> 10:56.560
The celebrities, the actors, the journalists and elites, they're not mad that the blue

10:56.560 --> 10:57.880
check costs money.

10:57.880 --> 11:02.920
If it costs $10,000 a month, they would gladly pay for a badge of exclusivity.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.860
They're mad that it costs an amount of money that you can afford.

11:05.860 --> 11:09.120
So if a peasant can afford it, they believe that they should get it for free and they

11:09.120 --> 11:12.860
have to make it very clear that you and them are not the same.

11:12.860 --> 11:13.940
You paid for it.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.500
They received it as a gift for being them.

11:16.500 --> 11:20.380
Whether or not that's actually true, the appearance of status is what's important here.

11:20.380 --> 11:24.340
The latest piece of the story is that verified accounts get boosted in the algorithm, meaning

11:24.340 --> 11:28.040
that if you pay the $8 a month or you have a check mark through some other method, more

11:28.040 --> 11:29.040
people will see your tweets.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.980
I don't know if this is a good or a bad move, we'll have to wait and see.

11:31.980 --> 11:34.960
But personally, I don't care too much because Twitter's a shithole anyway.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.440
The issue I have with this whole thing is before Twitter started de-verifying people

11:38.440 --> 11:41.240
for wrongthink, it was actually a good system.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.500
Verification is important.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.700
Not so that you know what the correct thing to think is, which is how a lot of proggs

11:45.700 --> 11:46.700
use the system.

11:46.700 --> 11:50.100
I think at least a small part of why people make fun of fact checkers and debunkers is

11:50.100 --> 11:51.920
due to the blue check phenomenon too.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.700
But it's actually important so that you can tell what a person or organization's official

11:55.700 --> 11:57.300
stance on a topic is.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.520
I remember a Twitter account that was meant to look like an official Twitch page, stating

12:00.520 --> 12:04.540
that Twitch had relented on the ad revenue split at the height of that controversy.

12:04.540 --> 12:07.940
It's a funny troll, but people quickly tuned in to the fact that it was a troll because

12:07.940 --> 12:10.800
the parody account didn't have a verified checkmark.

12:10.800 --> 12:14.360
Of course, verification doesn't mean that messages from official accounts are always

12:14.360 --> 12:15.360
trustworthy.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.000
Remember the great Twitter hack of 2020, where a bunch of prominent verified Twitter accounts

12:19.000 --> 12:21.180
were giving out Bitcoin scam links?

12:21.180 --> 12:25.640
A blue check won't stop you from getting hacked after you open that spam email like a moron.

12:25.640 --> 12:28.560
But for the most part, Twitter verification before worked.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.660
Once it became less about verifying that the person you're talking to is actually who they

12:31.660 --> 12:35.460
claim to be, and instead is somebody that promotes views that Twitter considers to be

12:35.460 --> 12:38.180
the truth, the entire system stopped working.

12:38.180 --> 12:42.460
Its collapse into a forepay status symbol was basically inevitable at that point, once

12:42.460 --> 12:44.500
the right owner of Twitter came around.

12:44.500 --> 12:48.980
To somebody as diehard capitalist as Elon Musk, there's no reason that what Twitter

12:48.980 --> 12:53.380
considers to be the truth wouldn't morph into whoever paid Twitter for the status.

12:53.380 --> 12:58.300
That's not to say that I think that paying $8 a month for a blue checkmark is a bad idea.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.300
It's not.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.260
Like Elon said, you gotta pay the bills somehow.

13:01.260 --> 13:05.300
In my opinion, there should be some type of badge, like the original verification,

13:05.300 --> 13:09.220
meant only for notable people who need to show that they are who they say they are,

13:09.220 --> 13:12.400
without prejudice in regards to what type of content they post.

13:12.400 --> 13:16.060
There's no reason that your Twitter account can't have multiple ranks or badges on it.

13:16.060 --> 13:19.260
Twitch does it, Discord does it, but I have a feeling that that door might be closed at

13:19.260 --> 13:20.260
this point.

13:20.260 --> 13:24.180
Oh well, it's still a lot of fun to watch the people addicted to Twitter wail and gnash

13:24.180 --> 13:26.220
their teeth over a tiny blue check.
