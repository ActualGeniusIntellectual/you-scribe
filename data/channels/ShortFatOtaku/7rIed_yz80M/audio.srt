00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Hey guys, Dev here. I figured I should probably make a short thinking video regarding what we

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,560
had talked about in the pre-show of The Weekly Sip yesterday. Tomorrow's video is still gonna

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,240
be Project Melody, it'll still come out, and in fact I might sound contradictory between this

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,480
video and that video, but I'm not. And hopefully I'll be able to show you why, so let's dive into

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,600
it a little bit. There were a few people in the chat room yesterday who objected when I said that

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,480
women had the ability to override their biological imperatives the same way that men do.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,160
Just so we're all on the same page here, what I was talking about was the fact that as humans,

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,880
we all have biological urges that pull us in this way or that, but as competent rational beings,

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,960
we do still have freedom of choice. This came up in the context of hypergamy. Hypergamy is a term

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,760
used in the social sciences for the act or practice of a person marrying a spouse of

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,120
higher caste or social status than themselves. More colloquially though, it refers to the general

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,120
practice of women deciding to marry up, and how the average woman, though obviously not all women,

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,320
prefer to share a high status male with other women than have a low status male all to

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,880
themselves. Obviously this is a very general rule, doesn't apply to everyone, does not apply to all

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,000
situations, but there definitely does seem to be a trend in this direction. So my logic was that even

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,600
though hypergamous behavior in women exists, there's no reason women can't choose not to

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,680
follow that biological directive, because I do think that it is at least somewhat biological,

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,320
and in fact there are biological directives that impact men and women both that individuals still

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,520
choose not to listen to. If everyone ate as much as their biological drives wanted them to,

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,760
we would all be a lot fatter than we are, and this is coming from a guy who's already fat.

21
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,000
People who are thin and in shape just wouldn't exist if we were all slaves to our biology,

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,120
but that's not the case. The very existence of people that are in shape, of either gender,

23
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:59,200
it kind of disproves that. So very clearly humans have biological directives that pull and push them

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,880
in certain ways, and very clearly we can choose not to follow them. But the people in my chat room

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,320
during that stream, they kind of had a double standard about it. They were saying that men can

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,320
choose to overpower their biology and act rationally, but women can't, and that just

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,360
doesn't make any sense to me. Like if men can override their destructive nature, certainly women

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,040
can too, and when men fall into it, certainly women can as well. It's the same rules for

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,320
both genders, and I don't believe that women are entirely driven by prerogative because men aren't.

30
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,960
There are definitely differences between the sexes obviously, you can't deny that, but I don't think

31
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,720
the differences go so far as to all men being able to be purely rational beings, and all women simply

32
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,160
being slaves to their impulses. I think that's how it works. I am definitely not in agreement with

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Arthur Schopenhauer when it comes to the woman question. It's been a long time since I've read

34
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,320
Schopenhauer, but I think I can still at the very least give you an outline of what he believed.

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,240
He believed that while men had the ability to have wildly different tastes in profession,

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,000
in passion, in talents and abilities, in fundamental personality, women ultimately had

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,720
no personality at all. Women instead were the great mimic. They would latch on to who they

38
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,520
perceived to be a successful male, temporarily take on attributes that would make her attractive

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,960
to him, at least in terms of personality, and then once her children were secure focus exclusively

40
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,800
on them to the detriment of him. Basically he did not believe that women were fully rational beings

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,200
the same way that men were, and that they had enough intellect basically to attract men not

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,160
only physically but also mentally, but deep down they only really had the goal of reproduction in

43
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,920
mind. And that's definitely an attitude that you see every once in a while among the red pill

44
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,480
communities. That's why there's like objections to gamer girls or whatever it is, even if the

45
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,280
girl in question actually does love video games for the merit of the video game, sometimes people

46
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,480
just believe that they can't and they're just simply there for attention. And you know what,

47
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,480
sometimes they are just there for attention, but it's certainly not all the time. One of my mods

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,520
said to me after the stream, if you make any facsimile of anti-feminist, anti-woke videos on

49
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,880
YouTube, or you say any hard truth about the state of most women today, you attract MGTOWs,

50
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:09,440
incels, pickup artists, and the rest of the manosphere. If you dare to say that most men

51
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,560
have problems, problems related to their attitudes and behavior, you'll attract feminists.

52
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,600
And to be honest, I'm not on either of those sides. I'm not a feminist, and I'm not a men's

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,240
rights activist. I am fundamentally an individualist. Of course, if the solutions

54
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,920
to some social problems have to be gendered because they overwhelmingly affect one gender

55
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,400
rather than the other, that's fine, I don't object to that. But at the same time, I'm also not

56
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,520
interested in this kind of tribalism. And I think some of these comments will actually let me

57
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,560
express what I'm saying more clearly. The chat wasn't saying women can't override their biological

58
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,880
prerogatives. Well, to be fair, yes, they were. The chat was definitely saying that. Maybe you

59
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,640
weren't saying that, but other people in the chat were. They were saying that they simply choose not

60
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,800
to and society only holds men accountable for doing so. I don't think so. I think things are

61
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,080
definitely swinging in that direction, but we're not there yet. And there are definitely instances

62
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,560
where men don't override their biological prerogatives and they get in no trouble for it.

63
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,480
I think it happens all the time. I don't think that this is specifically a gendered issue.

64
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,680
There are shitty men, there are shitty women, and they probably exist in roughly the same ratio.

65
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,000
And then he says that me dismissing an issue that I frequently do videos about does come

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,240
across as smug and irritating. This is the whole smug argument, which I do think I should probably

67
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,320
address. When I disagree with you on anything, that's not me being smug and it's not me

68
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,160
having an ego about it. Disagreement does not mean that I think I'm better than you. It just

69
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,560
means that we disagree. I've been having to deal with a specific group of haters for like a year

70
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,520
now. It's a small, very vocal group. And they started out as actually being fans of me. And

71
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,000
those fans, whenever I would disagree with them, they'd say that I'm getting a big ego because my

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,600
channel's growing or something. And it's like, no, I just don't agree with you, man. So you accept

73
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,360
that men and women are physically dimorphic, but not mentally? No, they're very clearly mentally

74
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,440
dimorphic as well. But I don't think that they're mentally dimorphic to the point that women can't

75
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,400
not act on impulse or something. I am extremely sympathetic to the individualist view you're

76
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,440
promoting. But the objection of not all is a bit of a dodge. I don't think it is. I think not all

77
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,600
is in fact the core issue here. Whenever some ridiculous feminist says, kill all men, or all

78
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,720
men are rapists or something ridiculous like that, all of us here say, hold on, not all men. And

79
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,200
that's the right reaction to have. And there is no reason to not have that exact same reaction when

80
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,800
things are going the other way. That's the point of individualism. It's that you treat people like

81
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,360
individuals. You know, another obvious example, if I meet an individual black man, I don't

82
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,320
necessarily think of black crime statistics or something. I treat him as a person, as an

83
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,280
individual. If he's going to be a criminal, it will be because of something he is, not because

84
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,920
of his race. The individual case is a drop in the bucket, except that all cases are individual

85
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,400
cases. Women have the hypergamous instinct and yes, they can fight against it, but it feels good

86
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,040
to do it. And what's more, the social pressures that once discouraged hypergamy have been reversed.

87
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,520
All of the major cultural influencers, Hollywood, the mainstream media and social media are almost

88
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,520
unanimous in their cry of you go girl, but that's certainly no different from men at this point.

89
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Yeah. Men are getting more pushback because, because they don't want to marry anymore and

90
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,960
that's causing certain, certain social problems. And the media is going after them for that,

91
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,480
but you have to keep in mind male sexuality can be just as destructive as female sexuality. If

92
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,400
it's allowed to be irresponsible. And if you seriously think that there's actually social

93
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,880
pressures right now on men to stop sleeping around, I don't know what world you're living in.

94
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,520
It seems like everybody, regardless of gender is incentivized to be promiscuous nowadays.

95
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,680
And that's probably to our detriment. In any case, this isn't me picking on any of these individuals.

96
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,920
I certainly don't want them to receive any hate. I just wanted to have the discussion.

97
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,680
I believe that men and women are fundamentally different in many ways. However, I do not believe

98
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,560
that women are some kind of sub race entirely enslaved to their hormones and their uteruses

99
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,120
who spend their days going around trying to find the alpha male to get pregnant by while keeping

100
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,280
the beta at home to raise the children. I'm sure there are some women that do that and we can

101
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,240
safely call them immoral. And we can definitely say you shouldn't be around them, but you can't

102
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,160
say that it's all women that do that. Just like you can't say that all men do whatever crazy thing

103
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,080
it is that feminists think that they do. And I'll leave you with some food for thought by going back

104
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,000
to this comment. Women are entirely driven by prerogative. They don't care who's owed what,

105
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,600
as long as they get what they want. If you actually think that, then how could you possibly

106
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,680
blame women for it? If it turns out to be true that women have no rational mind at all, they just

107
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,720
have the facade of rationality. And in fact, they are driven entirely by prerogative and there is

108
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,600
no possible way for them to help themselves, then they're not moral actors, are they? And you can't

109
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,240
blame them for what they do, can you? If it turns out that there actually is something fundamentally

110
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,360
different in the biology of women that means that they lack freedom of choice, then you can't blame

111
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,680
them for what they're doing. You can't put any responsibility on them and you certainly can't

112
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,920
punish them. They're simply doing what they're programmed to do. But none of us actually see

113
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,480
women that way. The fact that you're getting mad at women who do these terrible things proves that

114
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,120
you don't see them that way either. So yeah, I can't believe I actually have to say this,

115
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,040
but women are people. They have rights and they have responsibilities. We can hold their feet

116
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,120
to the fire when they don't fulfill those responsibilities, but the solution is not to

117
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,600
take away their rights. But just because I'm an anti-feminist, if you think I'm going to be taking

118
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,920
the black pill on the woman question, you guys are on the wrong YouTube channel.
