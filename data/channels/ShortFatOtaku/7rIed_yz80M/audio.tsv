0	5680	Hey guys, Dev here. I figured I should probably make a short thinking video regarding what we
5680	10560	had talked about in the pre-show of The Weekly Sip yesterday. Tomorrow's video is still gonna
10560	16240	be Project Melody, it'll still come out, and in fact I might sound contradictory between this
16240	20480	video and that video, but I'm not. And hopefully I'll be able to show you why, so let's dive into
20480	25600	it a little bit. There were a few people in the chat room yesterday who objected when I said that
25600	30480	women had the ability to override their biological imperatives the same way that men do.
30480	36160	Just so we're all on the same page here, what I was talking about was the fact that as humans,
36160	42880	we all have biological urges that pull us in this way or that, but as competent rational beings,
42880	48960	we do still have freedom of choice. This came up in the context of hypergamy. Hypergamy is a term
48960	53760	used in the social sciences for the act or practice of a person marrying a spouse of
53760	59120	higher caste or social status than themselves. More colloquially though, it refers to the general
59120	65120	practice of women deciding to marry up, and how the average woman, though obviously not all women,
65120	70320	prefer to share a high status male with other women than have a low status male all to
70320	74880	themselves. Obviously this is a very general rule, doesn't apply to everyone, does not apply to all
74880	80000	situations, but there definitely does seem to be a trend in this direction. So my logic was that even
80000	85600	though hypergamous behavior in women exists, there's no reason women can't choose not to
85600	89680	follow that biological directive, because I do think that it is at least somewhat biological,
89680	94320	and in fact there are biological directives that impact men and women both that individuals still
94320	99520	choose not to listen to. If everyone ate as much as their biological drives wanted them to,
99520	103760	we would all be a lot fatter than we are, and this is coming from a guy who's already fat.
103760	108000	People who are thin and in shape just wouldn't exist if we were all slaves to our biology,
108000	113120	but that's not the case. The very existence of people that are in shape, of either gender,
113120	119200	it kind of disproves that. So very clearly humans have biological directives that pull and push them
119200	124880	in certain ways, and very clearly we can choose not to follow them. But the people in my chat room
124880	128320	during that stream, they kind of had a double standard about it. They were saying that men can
128320	132320	choose to overpower their biology and act rationally, but women can't, and that just
132320	137360	doesn't make any sense to me. Like if men can override their destructive nature, certainly women
137360	143040	can too, and when men fall into it, certainly women can as well. It's the same rules for
143040	148320	both genders, and I don't believe that women are entirely driven by prerogative because men aren't.
148320	152960	There are definitely differences between the sexes obviously, you can't deny that, but I don't think
152960	158720	the differences go so far as to all men being able to be purely rational beings, and all women simply
158720	164160	being slaves to their impulses. I think that's how it works. I am definitely not in agreement with
164160	168160	Arthur Schopenhauer when it comes to the woman question. It's been a long time since I've read
168160	172320	Schopenhauer, but I think I can still at the very least give you an outline of what he believed.
172320	178240	He believed that while men had the ability to have wildly different tastes in profession,
178240	184000	in passion, in talents and abilities, in fundamental personality, women ultimately had
184000	188720	no personality at all. Women instead were the great mimic. They would latch on to who they
188720	193520	perceived to be a successful male, temporarily take on attributes that would make her attractive
193520	198960	to him, at least in terms of personality, and then once her children were secure focus exclusively
198960	204800	on them to the detriment of him. Basically he did not believe that women were fully rational beings
204800	209200	the same way that men were, and that they had enough intellect basically to attract men not
209200	214160	only physically but also mentally, but deep down they only really had the goal of reproduction in
214160	217920	mind. And that's definitely an attitude that you see every once in a while among the red pill
217920	222480	communities. That's why there's like objections to gamer girls or whatever it is, even if the
222480	227280	girl in question actually does love video games for the merit of the video game, sometimes people
227280	230480	just believe that they can't and they're just simply there for attention. And you know what,
230480	234480	sometimes they are just there for attention, but it's certainly not all the time. One of my mods
234480	239520	said to me after the stream, if you make any facsimile of anti-feminist, anti-woke videos on
239520	244880	YouTube, or you say any hard truth about the state of most women today, you attract MGTOWs,
244880	249440	incels, pickup artists, and the rest of the manosphere. If you dare to say that most men
249440	254560	have problems, problems related to their attitudes and behavior, you'll attract feminists.
254560	259600	And to be honest, I'm not on either of those sides. I'm not a feminist, and I'm not a men's
259600	264240	rights activist. I am fundamentally an individualist. Of course, if the solutions
264240	267920	to some social problems have to be gendered because they overwhelmingly affect one gender
267920	272400	rather than the other, that's fine, I don't object to that. But at the same time, I'm also not
272400	275520	interested in this kind of tribalism. And I think some of these comments will actually let me
276320	280560	express what I'm saying more clearly. The chat wasn't saying women can't override their biological
280560	284880	prerogatives. Well, to be fair, yes, they were. The chat was definitely saying that. Maybe you
284880	288640	weren't saying that, but other people in the chat were. They were saying that they simply choose not
288640	292800	to and society only holds men accountable for doing so. I don't think so. I think things are
292800	296080	definitely swinging in that direction, but we're not there yet. And there are definitely instances
296080	300560	where men don't override their biological prerogatives and they get in no trouble for it.
300560	304480	I think it happens all the time. I don't think that this is specifically a gendered issue.
304480	309680	There are shitty men, there are shitty women, and they probably exist in roughly the same ratio.
309680	314000	And then he says that me dismissing an issue that I frequently do videos about does come
314000	318240	across as smug and irritating. This is the whole smug argument, which I do think I should probably
318240	324320	address. When I disagree with you on anything, that's not me being smug and it's not me
324320	328160	having an ego about it. Disagreement does not mean that I think I'm better than you. It just
328160	332560	means that we disagree. I've been having to deal with a specific group of haters for like a year
332560	339520	now. It's a small, very vocal group. And they started out as actually being fans of me. And
339520	344000	those fans, whenever I would disagree with them, they'd say that I'm getting a big ego because my
344000	347600	channel's growing or something. And it's like, no, I just don't agree with you, man. So you accept
347600	351360	that men and women are physically dimorphic, but not mentally? No, they're very clearly mentally
351360	355440	dimorphic as well. But I don't think that they're mentally dimorphic to the point that women can't
356160	360400	not act on impulse or something. I am extremely sympathetic to the individualist view you're
360400	365440	promoting. But the objection of not all is a bit of a dodge. I don't think it is. I think not all
365440	371600	is in fact the core issue here. Whenever some ridiculous feminist says, kill all men, or all
371600	376720	men are rapists or something ridiculous like that, all of us here say, hold on, not all men. And
376720	381200	that's the right reaction to have. And there is no reason to not have that exact same reaction when
381200	384800	things are going the other way. That's the point of individualism. It's that you treat people like
384800	389360	individuals. You know, another obvious example, if I meet an individual black man, I don't
389360	394320	necessarily think of black crime statistics or something. I treat him as a person, as an
394320	399280	individual. If he's going to be a criminal, it will be because of something he is, not because
399280	403920	of his race. The individual case is a drop in the bucket, except that all cases are individual
403920	408400	cases. Women have the hypergamous instinct and yes, they can fight against it, but it feels good
408400	413040	to do it. And what's more, the social pressures that once discouraged hypergamy have been reversed.
413040	417520	All of the major cultural influencers, Hollywood, the mainstream media and social media are almost
417520	421520	unanimous in their cry of you go girl, but that's certainly no different from men at this point.
421520	425520	Yeah. Men are getting more pushback because, because they don't want to marry anymore and
425520	428960	that's causing certain, certain social problems. And the media is going after them for that,
428960	434480	but you have to keep in mind male sexuality can be just as destructive as female sexuality. If
434480	438400	it's allowed to be irresponsible. And if you seriously think that there's actually social
438400	442880	pressures right now on men to stop sleeping around, I don't know what world you're living in.
442880	447520	It seems like everybody, regardless of gender is incentivized to be promiscuous nowadays.
447520	451680	And that's probably to our detriment. In any case, this isn't me picking on any of these individuals.
451680	455920	I certainly don't want them to receive any hate. I just wanted to have the discussion.
455920	461680	I believe that men and women are fundamentally different in many ways. However, I do not believe
461680	466560	that women are some kind of sub race entirely enslaved to their hormones and their uteruses
466560	471120	who spend their days going around trying to find the alpha male to get pregnant by while keeping
471120	475280	the beta at home to raise the children. I'm sure there are some women that do that and we can
475280	480240	safely call them immoral. And we can definitely say you shouldn't be around them, but you can't
480240	484160	say that it's all women that do that. Just like you can't say that all men do whatever crazy thing
484160	488080	it is that feminists think that they do. And I'll leave you with some food for thought by going back
488080	492000	to this comment. Women are entirely driven by prerogative. They don't care who's owed what,
492000	495600	as long as they get what they want. If you actually think that, then how could you possibly
495600	499680	blame women for it? If it turns out to be true that women have no rational mind at all, they just
499680	504720	have the facade of rationality. And in fact, they are driven entirely by prerogative and there is
504720	509600	no possible way for them to help themselves, then they're not moral actors, are they? And you can't
509600	514240	blame them for what they do, can you? If it turns out that there actually is something fundamentally
514240	519360	different in the biology of women that means that they lack freedom of choice, then you can't blame
519360	523680	them for what they're doing. You can't put any responsibility on them and you certainly can't
523680	527920	punish them. They're simply doing what they're programmed to do. But none of us actually see
527920	532480	women that way. The fact that you're getting mad at women who do these terrible things proves that
532480	537120	you don't see them that way either. So yeah, I can't believe I actually have to say this,
537120	543040	but women are people. They have rights and they have responsibilities. We can hold their feet
543040	547120	to the fire when they don't fulfill those responsibilities, but the solution is not to
547120	551600	take away their rights. But just because I'm an anti-feminist, if you think I'm going to be taking
551600	555920	the black pill on the woman question, you guys are on the wrong YouTube channel.
