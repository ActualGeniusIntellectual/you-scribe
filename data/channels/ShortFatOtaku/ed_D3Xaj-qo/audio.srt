1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,860
Alright, we've all heard of that cancerous extra credits video that just came out, right?

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,120
Evil Race is our bad game design?

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,140
You know, with bangers like this?

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,280
Much of the recent conversation on Orcs points out that characterizing a whole species in

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,200
your game as ugly, warlike, and malevolent might be harmful to real-world groups regularly

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,240
mischaracterized as ugly, warlike, and malevolent.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,520
Yeah, um, back when I played Warcraft, I didn't really look at this and think it was this.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,160
Even when they introduced brown orcs, I still didn't really get the feeling that there was

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,800
some kind of hidden racist author whispering in my ear,

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,960
hey, this is actually about black people.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,960
Some people did though, like this person.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,560
Non-binary, 22, guitarist, gamer, and leftist.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,880
Anti-fascism is self-defense.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,160
Orcs are clearly supposed to be black people even though they're a fantasy race from

15
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,440
a fictional world.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,040
It would seem that it takes a specific personality type, maybe even a specific type of politics,

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,960
to view orcs as black people.

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,000
And for the rest of us, maybe we just accept that it's a fantasy setting because we don't

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,840
have our heads so far up our own asses that we're tongue-fucking our lunch.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,800
But this discourse isn't new.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,620
Like a year ago, Sofia Narwhits got dogpiled for saying that gatekeeping your hobbies from

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,680
leftist corruption is a good thing.

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,360
After a crowd of concave brains started complaining about the skin colour of orcs and dark elves

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,360
and shit.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,640
It's okay dude, it's a fantasy setting, you'll survive.

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Guess what?

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,360
In Sargon's Crusaders campaign, it was Arab-looking people who made up the bulk of the medieval

28
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,760
feudalistic society, while the redheads and gingers were uncontacted tribesmen a continent

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,880
away, and that's okay.

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,460
I didn't get offended by it and have a massive breakdown just because I shared my skin colour

31
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,460
with them.

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,360
And that's the core of this discussion.

33
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,760
Not every idea needs to be autistically pushed to its natural end result.

34
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,480
Not every stone needs to be overturned.

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,320
Sometimes you can just compromise.

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,520
Sometimes you can just let things be.

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,080
Let me show you what I mean.

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,760
Rule Zero, the idea that the GM can bend the rules in the name of fun, is toxic.

39
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,440
Played by the word of God only.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,380
Everything must be strictly regimented and codified, sanitized and scientific.

41
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,120
And that includes your game nights.

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,720
The rulebook is law.

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
Hot take.

44
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,960
The idea for stats is neutral at best and toxic at worst.

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,120
Randomness is not fair.

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,140
Unfairness is not equal.

47
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,160
Fun is secondary to equality.

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,120
How tabletop RPGs are being reclaimed from bigots and jerks.

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,720
Cthulhu, the horror game where you slowly go insane from encountering the elder gods?

50
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,080
Well that's ableist.

51
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,560
So now it's a generic time traveling action romp.

52
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,440
Vampire the Masquerade, the game where you literally play the villain?

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,560
The unholy cursed living dead?

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,100
Well that's fascist.

55
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,140
But now every character is woke as fuck.

56
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,180
Dungeons and Dragons, claiming that races have an evil alignment?

57
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,420
Or an evil nature?

58
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,380
Or hell, a nature at all?

59
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,520
Well of course, that's racist.

60
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,260
The people who complain about any of this are missing the point.

61
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,940
A game is where you do things that you wouldn't do in real life.

62
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,520
It's where you step into the role of somebody you specifically aren't, and explore those

63
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
ideas.

64
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,060
I have never been an obese jolly monk, or a loli vampire soldier, or a homeless half

65
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,180
elf wildling.

66
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,740
It's like I've never been the hero of time, or the vault dweller.

67
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,580
Part of playing any game is putting yourself into situations you would never actually get

68
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,580
into otherwise.

69
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,620
I did a video about this last year, where leftists got ass mad that Arch Sargon V Oozaloo

70
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,820
Rags and I played a game of Vampire the Masquerade, where we basically abandoned most of the VTM

71
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,820
lore and just adapted the game's systems to play as secret Nazi vampire super soldiers.

72
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,740
That was the game where I was the loli by the way.

73
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,220
Those complaining busy body leftists missed the point, obviously, because we were playing

74
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,540
a villainous campaign.

75
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,260
You'd think the whole vampire thing would get that across, but that was offensive to

76
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,620
these people, and surely was a sign that we were hidden fascists ourselves in real life.

77
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,740
Of course if we were to play as a secret communist vampire super soldiers, nobody would be saying

78
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,580
that we were hidden socialists or something like that, nor would any of us be called secret

79
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,620
Nazis if we played as a Nazi soldier during a World War 2 shooter.

80
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,420
We're talking about people who have never even heard of Ilsa She-Wolf of the SS, or

81
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,740
watched Hellsing with their over the top, extremely evil and yet simultaneously absurd

82
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,220
portrayal of Nazis.

83
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,500
And yes Hellsing fans, when your neo-nazi consists of a Hitler Youth Catboy, there is

84
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,860
some absurdity there.

85
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,980
The point I'm making is that you do not play Nazis in a game because you are one, but rather

86
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,540
because you are not one.

87
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,240
That's the point of exploring this kind of evil.

88
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,380
Most of these leftists who complained, SJWs, socialists, whatever you want to call them,

89
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,420
if they were in Germany during the Second World War, they would be Auschwitz camp guards,

90
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,420
and they would enjoy it.

91
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,420
It's not about the political difference, not really, it's about their psychology, their

92
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,420
personality.

93
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,420
They are a pathology looking for a cause.

94
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,340
And the original creators of Vampire the Masquerade knew this.

95
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,740
In VTM's first edition, the disclaimer in the book says,

96
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,580
The themes and issues described in this game may be disturbing to some and distasteful

97
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,720
to others, though our purpose is not to offend.

98
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,940
Our use of the vampire as a metaphor and as a channel for storytelling may be misconstrued.

99
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,240
To be clear, vampires are not real.

100
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
The extent to which they can be said to exist is revealed only in what they can teach us

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,720
of the human condition and of the fragility of the splendor which we call life.

102
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,200
A completely reasonable statement.

103
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,900
There's edgy shit in the game, some of you may not like it, don't play it if you're squeamish.

104
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,900
There is evil here, not because we're evil, but because we are exploring evil.

105
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,280
So that we may be good.

106
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,720
To contrast, the newest edition of VTM contains several pages about how fascists, aka people

107
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,620
who object to minorities punching up, yes it really says that, are not allowed to play

108
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
the game.

109
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,820
And that the game is about monsters, don't be a monster yourself, as if that even has

110
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,820
to be said.

111
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,840
The same thing happened with Warhammer, when Arch was getting cancelled over some obvious

112
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,000
nonsense last year.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,640
The statement from Warhammer is that Warhammer is for everyone, and that our fantasy settings

114
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,200
are grim and dark, but that is not a reflection of who we are or how we feel the real world

115
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
should be.

116
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,960
Like, people actually believed these guys wanted to implement the Imperium of Man IRL.

117
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,560
Like people actually thought White Wolf wanted to create vampires who would run the entirety

118
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,740
of society from behind the scenes.

119
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,800
Why does this nonsense even need to be said?

120
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,800
I'm not actually off on a tangent right now, though maybe it sounds like I am.

121
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,520
And the reason is, I think I actually have an answer to that question, why does this

122
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,880
even need to be said?

123
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,360
And it ties all the way back to that dumb video from Extra Credits.

124
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,440
If you've been watching me for a while, you know that I took a lot of lefty classes

125
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
in university.

126
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,920
In one of these classes, the topic of the day was the culture of play, and we had to

127
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
read these essays.

128
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,660
Look at the names of this garbage, Barbie in black and white, making sense of the modern

129
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,660
toy box.

130
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,320
It was honestly all just intersectional junk, and I really regret wasting the time and money

131
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,360
that I spent on it.

132
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,860
And hey, if you don't mind helping me recoup it, you can always hit up my subscribe star.

133
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,080
And just for you, because I like you a lot, I reread these articles before recording this

134
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,160
video, and I am happy to report that just as I remembered them, they contain absolutely

135
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,620
nothing of value.

136
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:03,600
But from that entire lesson, there is one kernel of truth that I think is worth discussing.

137
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,320
And it is that play is subversive.

138
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,580
And of course it is.

139
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,720
Play is where the rules get loosened a bit.

140
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,200
It's where you can push the boundaries with minimal harm.

141
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,800
It's where you can compete at something that is low stakes.

142
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,400
It's where you explore and go on adventures.

143
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,920
Playing is like dreaming, in that it's a realm where wacky things can happen, and you can

144
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,720
test your reactions to them.

145
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,380
It's where new ideas appear.

146
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,920
It's the boundary between the physical and the psychological.

147
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,500
It makes a lot of sense to me that the play impulse shares a heavy overlap with the sexual

148
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
impulse.

149
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,960
The action of play overrides the intention of the toy, in some sense.

150
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,860
The professor of the class, while going over that ridiculous Barbie essay, pointed out

151
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,300
that despite the unrealistic beauty standards of the Barbie doll, the gender roles it impressed

152
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,260
upon the young girls playing with them, and other such tabula rasa nonsense, a lot of

153
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,000
little girls play with Barbies incorrectly.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,040
That is, they don't only play house with them, or whatever.

155
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,200
They'll pop their arms off in a pretend gruesome car accident.

156
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,520
They'll cut their hair into weird styles.

157
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,080
They'll throw them around the room.

158
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,580
They'll make them say stuff completely out of character for the approved Barbie personality.

159
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,700
And that is because play is subversive.

160
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,880
If your culture hands a child a toy that is designed to teach them specific lessons about

161
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,280
how to be an adult, there's a high chance that if left to their own devices, the child

162
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,160
will make up their own rules instead.

163
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,400
I think this is why we have so much nostalgia for an era where we were left alone to play

164
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
video games.

165
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,840
Where the games lacked a political message, and there was no reason to think about anything

166
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,260
other than going on an adventure.

167
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,480
We weren't being told what to think, beyond the basic world building of the game, and

168
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,200
the role we were asked to inhabit.

169
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,840
It's not sexist that Mario saves the princess, it simply is.

170
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,880
And we know this to be the case, because when we turned on Metroid, nobody actually thought,

171
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,440
why am I playing the role of the Kidnappy?

172
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,360
When I took that class and read those essays and listened to that professor blather on,

173
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,160
it was in an era where video games were still largely devoid of SJWs.

174
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,960
Yes, I'm that old.

175
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,840
And the class, the essays, and the lecture revolved around how play was subversive, and

176
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,640
the implication was that play was the tool we would use to subvert the cultural hegemony.

177
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,840
It didn't matter if the makers of the Barbie dolls and the dump truck toys intended to

178
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,560
teach children strict gender roles, because we played with them our way, not theirs.

179
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,280
We would take away our values, not theirs.

180
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,840
And then, when we entered the workforce, we would implement our values, not theirs.

181
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,760
And now that my classmates have done the subverting, they've seized power in entertainment, in

182
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
games and movies.

183
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,000
They understand full well that play is subversive, that their hard work can be undone by their

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,760
own customers refusing to play by their rules.

185
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,480
So, of course, you're not welcome to play Warhammer or Vampire or Cthulhu or D&D if

186
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,280
you don't have the correct thinking.

187
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,520
Of course, the games need to be changed to add player consent forms, and wheelchair accessible

188
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,440
dungeons, and altering how race works as a mechanic, and adding heavy-handed disclaimers

189
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,460
about how awful and culturally insensitive their old content used to be.

190
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,780
In order to prevent the subversion of play, the subverters are doing everything short

191
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,360
of telling people that you are just no longer allowed to play the old versions of their

192
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,360
games.

193
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,040
And some of them are even starting to do that too, looking at you Blizzard.

194
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,440
The Extra Credits video has this to say about biological essentialism.

195
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,740
This idea that a certain subgroup, like race, nationality or sex, has inalienable traits

196
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,560
is called biological essentialism or simply bio-essentialism, and it's a valid way to

197
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,800
talk about qualities like how many legs an animal has or whether it can fly.

198
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,400
But all too often, this concept gets misused in untrue statements, like pit bulls are a

199
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,660
violent breed, men are more logical than women, or Asians are better at math.

200
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,280
Now chances are, if a game is set in the real world, that the designers are avoiding these

201
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,800
tropes because they aren't real, as multiple fields of societal and hard science can readily

202
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
prove to you.

203
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,880
But speculative fiction offers us an opportunity to reify or make real various things which

204
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,200
don't exist or to exaggerate things which do.

205
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,480
Basically if a character is intelligent enough to be considered a person with rights and

206
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,160
responsibilities within their society, then they are somehow magically unshackled from

207
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
their biology.

208
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,800
The leftist position is that the physical differences between the races should no longer

209
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
matter.

210
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,760
Both those differences created wildly different brains, because it's ultimately the collectivist

211
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,180
position that the will is separate from the body, not strictly leftist, for example religious

212
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,680
people on the right often say that the soul is separate from the body.

213
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,120
Meanwhile people on the left often pretend that they're purely rational and that their

214
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,400
emotions never get the better of them or ever influence their decision making.

215
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,120
Both of these positions, even though they are politically at odds with one another,

216
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,600
appeal to the same flaw.

217
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,360
The idea that your brain is hardware and your personality or your soul or your consciousness

218
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,440
or your will or whatever is software running on the hardware.

219
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,200
But we know that to be incorrect.

220
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,620
Your will is not separate from your body.

221
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,620
You are your brain.

222
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:54,280
And as a quick side note, research into artificial intelligence has hit such insurmountable roadblocks

223
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:01,000
because we are rapidly discovering that an intelligence without a body is almost non-functional.

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,500
There has to be some sense of self, there has to be some way to identify what is you

225
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,000
and what is not you.

226
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,160
And significant advancements in creating an actual generalized AI is only starting to

227
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,360
come about because we have made robot bodies, rather than simply programming them on computers.

228
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,120
Extra Credits even refers to Mass Effect in his video, a setting where it makes even less

229
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,920
sense to talk about biological essentialism than in D&D, because the various alien races

230
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,640
within the Mass Effect universe are biologically distinct to the point that, with a few specific

231
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,240
exceptions, there is no Star Trek style procreation between them.

232
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,480
There's no way that their brains function the same way to the point that their natures,

233
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,200
biological urges, thought processes and so on are equalized for the sake of surface level

234
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
political correctness.

235
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,140
Speaking of Star Trek, that's literally how it works over there.

236
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,380
Almost all of the aliens in Star Trek are just humans wearing different hats.

237
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,960
The Klingons and Vulcans might be physically stronger, the Pakleds seem to be naturally

238
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,380
stupid, but beyond that, every other difference is surface level.

239
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,400
It doesn't matter that Ferengi have erogenous zones on their ears, because what really makes

240
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,200
the Ferengi distinct in the show is their corporatism.

241
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,400
And through the show we see that's entirely culturally constructed.

242
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,720
Nearly every Cardassian that we meet is a legitimate state-worshipping fascist, but

243
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,840
the show points out that that too is culturally constructed.

244
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,760
With just a few exceptions, the differences in race are cultural, and it would make little

245
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,960
sense to appeal to biology if you were playing a game set in Star Trek's universe.

246
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,640
In Mass Effect it's the complete opposite.

247
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,520
The biological differences are so vast that the species in fact matter quite a bit.

248
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,880
You cannot make Aquarian survive without their bio-suit solely through cultural change.

249
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,400
In other words, this is a lefty complaining about biological essentialism in an area where

250
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,920
it actually really makes sense to be biologically essentialist, way more so than it does with

251
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,880
real-life races of humans.

252
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,180
And to your average everyday normie, it looks like they're doing it for woke points.

253
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,260
In fact, they probably think they're doing it for woke points.

254
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,880
I doubt they've read Barbie in Black and White.

255
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,120
But the philosophy that drives this sort of stuff is ultimately a kind of cultural conformity.

256
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Think of it like this.

257
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,280
When you go to a scary movie, you're going there to be scared.

258
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,780
You're going so that you may immerse yourself in a reality that doesn't actually exist

259
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,800
for you in that time and that place, so that you may feel being scared without actually

260
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,380
being in the situation personally.

261
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,080
Your politics don't matter, what's going on outside of the movie doesn't matter.

262
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,800
And the one thing that would take you out of it more than anything else would be a constant

263
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,340
glaring reminder in the corner of the screen saying, this is not real.

264
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,900
That is the practical end result of the everything is political style of storytelling.

265
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,820
If the creator's politics are so immensely important, and socialists and SJWs surely

266
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,680
do believe that they are, why would they ever give you a way to escape them in their escapism?

267
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,520
Why would they allow the subversion of play to give you an opportunity to unwind, to detox,

268
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,560
to be exposed to an alternative narrative?

269
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,720
Why wouldn't they want every single bit of entertainment to be twisted towards their

270
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,480
position so that there's no rest from the propaganda?

271
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,640
Why wouldn't every video game, tabletop game, movie, TV show feature only the proper politics?

272
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,600
And if for some reason it could not, instead feature giant red flashing warning signs that

273
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,580
scream this is bad, don't be problematic over and over.

274
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,220
Why would the world of pretend be a refuge from the real world?

275
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,880
With this in mind, you can now understand their moves.

276
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,300
In this type of environment, of course they would say, Warhammer is for everyone, or tabletop

277
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,480
is for everyone, video games are for everyone, etc, etc.

278
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,440
So that as many people as possible absorb their pre-approved politics.

279
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,000
In a free liberal society, Warhammer would not actually be for everyone, sorry to say.

280
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,280
Instead, Warhammer would be for anyone, not everyone.

281
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,440
It would be for people who like Warhammer, or might like Warhammer.

282
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,880
And there's no reason for Warhammer to pander to people who don't like it.

283
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,080
Unless of course the end goal is not the game, but the politics.

284
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,840
These people already know how subversive play is, they know how it can change minds and

285
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,520
destroy cultures, which is why they will only let you play by their rules.

286
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,320
Extra Credits is just the next useless idiot in a very, very long line of useless idiots,

287
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,360
who thinks that they're saying something smart and progressive, but are ultimately just another

288
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
part of the problem.

289
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,440
I wouldn't worry too much about it though, they're lefty YouTubers after all.

290
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,720
I'd wager that the inevitable allegations against them will probably roll in in the

291
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,720
next few years, and then they'll just be cancelled by the very same culture that they

292
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,280
helped to create.

293
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,000
