WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.860
Alright, we've all heard of that cancerous extra credits video that just came out, right?

00:10.860 --> 00:13.120
Evil Race is our bad game design?

00:13.120 --> 00:15.140
You know, with bangers like this?

00:15.140 --> 00:19.280
Much of the recent conversation on Orcs points out that characterizing a whole species in

00:19.280 --> 00:24.200
your game as ugly, warlike, and malevolent might be harmful to real-world groups regularly

00:24.200 --> 00:27.240
mischaracterized as ugly, warlike, and malevolent.

00:27.240 --> 00:33.520
Yeah, um, back when I played Warcraft, I didn't really look at this and think it was this.

00:33.520 --> 00:38.160
Even when they introduced brown orcs, I still didn't really get the feeling that there was

00:38.160 --> 00:41.800
some kind of hidden racist author whispering in my ear,

00:41.800 --> 00:44.960
hey, this is actually about black people.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.960
Some people did though, like this person.

00:46.960 --> 00:50.560
Non-binary, 22, guitarist, gamer, and leftist.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.880
Anti-fascism is self-defense.

00:52.880 --> 00:57.160
Orcs are clearly supposed to be black people even though they're a fantasy race from

00:57.160 --> 00:58.440
a fictional world.

00:58.440 --> 01:04.040
It would seem that it takes a specific personality type, maybe even a specific type of politics,

01:04.040 --> 01:05.960
to view orcs as black people.

01:05.960 --> 01:10.000
And for the rest of us, maybe we just accept that it's a fantasy setting because we don't

01:10.000 --> 01:14.840
have our heads so far up our own asses that we're tongue-fucking our lunch.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.800
But this discourse isn't new.

01:16.800 --> 01:22.620
Like a year ago, Sofia Narwhits got dogpiled for saying that gatekeeping your hobbies from

01:22.620 --> 01:24.680
leftist corruption is a good thing.

01:24.680 --> 01:29.360
After a crowd of concave brains started complaining about the skin colour of orcs and dark elves

01:29.360 --> 01:30.360
and shit.

01:30.360 --> 01:32.640
It's okay dude, it's a fantasy setting, you'll survive.

01:32.640 --> 01:33.640
Guess what?

01:33.640 --> 01:38.360
In Sargon's Crusaders campaign, it was Arab-looking people who made up the bulk of the medieval

01:38.360 --> 01:43.760
feudalistic society, while the redheads and gingers were uncontacted tribesmen a continent

01:43.760 --> 01:44.880
away, and that's okay.

01:44.880 --> 01:49.460
I didn't get offended by it and have a massive breakdown just because I shared my skin colour

01:49.460 --> 01:50.460
with them.

01:50.460 --> 01:52.360
And that's the core of this discussion.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.760
Not every idea needs to be autistically pushed to its natural end result.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.480
Not every stone needs to be overturned.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.320
Sometimes you can just compromise.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.520
Sometimes you can just let things be.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.080
Let me show you what I mean.

02:04.080 --> 02:09.760
Rule Zero, the idea that the GM can bend the rules in the name of fun, is toxic.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.440
Played by the word of God only.

02:11.440 --> 02:15.380
Everything must be strictly regimented and codified, sanitized and scientific.

02:15.380 --> 02:17.120
And that includes your game nights.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.720
The rulebook is law.

02:18.720 --> 02:19.720
Hot take.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.960
The idea for stats is neutral at best and toxic at worst.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.120
Randomness is not fair.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.140
Unfairness is not equal.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.160
Fun is secondary to equality.

02:29.160 --> 02:33.120
How tabletop RPGs are being reclaimed from bigots and jerks.

02:33.120 --> 02:37.720
Cthulhu, the horror game where you slowly go insane from encountering the elder gods?

02:37.720 --> 02:39.080
Well that's ableist.

02:39.080 --> 02:41.560
So now it's a generic time traveling action romp.

02:41.560 --> 02:45.440
Vampire the Masquerade, the game where you literally play the villain?

02:45.440 --> 02:47.560
The unholy cursed living dead?

02:47.560 --> 02:49.100
Well that's fascist.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.140
But now every character is woke as fuck.

02:51.140 --> 02:55.180
Dungeons and Dragons, claiming that races have an evil alignment?

02:55.180 --> 02:56.420
Or an evil nature?

02:56.420 --> 02:58.380
Or hell, a nature at all?

02:58.380 --> 03:00.520
Well of course, that's racist.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.260
The people who complain about any of this are missing the point.

03:03.260 --> 03:06.940
A game is where you do things that you wouldn't do in real life.

03:06.940 --> 03:10.520
It's where you step into the role of somebody you specifically aren't, and explore those

03:10.520 --> 03:11.520
ideas.

03:11.520 --> 03:16.060
I have never been an obese jolly monk, or a loli vampire soldier, or a homeless half

03:16.060 --> 03:17.180
elf wildling.

03:17.180 --> 03:19.740
It's like I've never been the hero of time, or the vault dweller.

03:19.740 --> 03:23.580
Part of playing any game is putting yourself into situations you would never actually get

03:23.580 --> 03:24.580
into otherwise.

03:24.580 --> 03:29.620
I did a video about this last year, where leftists got ass mad that Arch Sargon V Oozaloo

03:29.620 --> 03:34.820
Rags and I played a game of Vampire the Masquerade, where we basically abandoned most of the VTM

03:34.820 --> 03:39.820
lore and just adapted the game's systems to play as secret Nazi vampire super soldiers.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.740
That was the game where I was the loli by the way.

03:41.740 --> 03:46.220
Those complaining busy body leftists missed the point, obviously, because we were playing

03:46.220 --> 03:47.540
a villainous campaign.

03:47.540 --> 03:51.260
You'd think the whole vampire thing would get that across, but that was offensive to

03:51.260 --> 03:55.620
these people, and surely was a sign that we were hidden fascists ourselves in real life.

03:55.620 --> 03:59.740
Of course if we were to play as a secret communist vampire super soldiers, nobody would be saying

03:59.740 --> 04:03.580
that we were hidden socialists or something like that, nor would any of us be called secret

04:03.580 --> 04:06.620
Nazis if we played as a Nazi soldier during a World War 2 shooter.

04:06.620 --> 04:10.420
We're talking about people who have never even heard of Ilsa She-Wolf of the SS, or

04:10.420 --> 04:15.740
watched Hellsing with their over the top, extremely evil and yet simultaneously absurd

04:15.740 --> 04:17.220
portrayal of Nazis.

04:17.220 --> 04:22.500
And yes Hellsing fans, when your neo-nazi consists of a Hitler Youth Catboy, there is

04:22.500 --> 04:23.860
some absurdity there.

04:23.860 --> 04:27.980
The point I'm making is that you do not play Nazis in a game because you are one, but rather

04:27.980 --> 04:29.540
because you are not one.

04:29.540 --> 04:32.240
That's the point of exploring this kind of evil.

04:32.240 --> 04:36.380
Most of these leftists who complained, SJWs, socialists, whatever you want to call them,

04:36.380 --> 04:41.420
if they were in Germany during the Second World War, they would be Auschwitz camp guards,

04:41.420 --> 04:42.420
and they would enjoy it.

04:42.420 --> 04:46.420
It's not about the political difference, not really, it's about their psychology, their

04:46.420 --> 04:47.420
personality.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.420
They are a pathology looking for a cause.

04:49.420 --> 04:52.340
And the original creators of Vampire the Masquerade knew this.

04:52.340 --> 04:55.740
In VTM's first edition, the disclaimer in the book says,

04:55.740 --> 04:59.580
The themes and issues described in this game may be disturbing to some and distasteful

04:59.580 --> 05:02.720
to others, though our purpose is not to offend.

05:02.720 --> 05:07.940
Our use of the vampire as a metaphor and as a channel for storytelling may be misconstrued.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.240
To be clear, vampires are not real.

05:10.240 --> 05:14.000
The extent to which they can be said to exist is revealed only in what they can teach us

05:14.000 --> 05:17.720
of the human condition and of the fragility of the splendor which we call life.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.200
A completely reasonable statement.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.900
There's edgy shit in the game, some of you may not like it, don't play it if you're squeamish.

05:22.900 --> 05:26.900
There is evil here, not because we're evil, but because we are exploring evil.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.280
So that we may be good.

05:28.280 --> 05:33.720
To contrast, the newest edition of VTM contains several pages about how fascists, aka people

05:33.720 --> 05:37.620
who object to minorities punching up, yes it really says that, are not allowed to play

05:37.620 --> 05:38.620
the game.

05:38.620 --> 05:41.820
And that the game is about monsters, don't be a monster yourself, as if that even has

05:41.820 --> 05:42.820
to be said.

05:42.820 --> 05:45.840
The same thing happened with Warhammer, when Arch was getting cancelled over some obvious

05:45.840 --> 05:47.000
nonsense last year.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.640
The statement from Warhammer is that Warhammer is for everyone, and that our fantasy settings

05:51.640 --> 05:56.200
are grim and dark, but that is not a reflection of who we are or how we feel the real world

05:56.200 --> 05:57.200
should be.

05:57.200 --> 06:01.960
Like, people actually believed these guys wanted to implement the Imperium of Man IRL.

06:01.960 --> 06:06.560
Like people actually thought White Wolf wanted to create vampires who would run the entirety

06:06.560 --> 06:08.740
of society from behind the scenes.

06:08.740 --> 06:10.800
Why does this nonsense even need to be said?

06:10.800 --> 06:13.800
I'm not actually off on a tangent right now, though maybe it sounds like I am.

06:13.800 --> 06:18.520
And the reason is, I think I actually have an answer to that question, why does this

06:18.520 --> 06:19.880
even need to be said?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.360
And it ties all the way back to that dumb video from Extra Credits.

06:22.360 --> 06:25.440
If you've been watching me for a while, you know that I took a lot of lefty classes

06:25.440 --> 06:26.440
in university.

06:26.680 --> 06:30.920
In one of these classes, the topic of the day was the culture of play, and we had to

06:30.920 --> 06:32.920
read these essays.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.660
Look at the names of this garbage, Barbie in black and white, making sense of the modern

06:36.660 --> 06:37.660
toy box.

06:37.660 --> 06:42.320
It was honestly all just intersectional junk, and I really regret wasting the time and money

06:42.320 --> 06:43.360
that I spent on it.

06:43.360 --> 06:47.860
And hey, if you don't mind helping me recoup it, you can always hit up my subscribe star.

06:47.860 --> 06:52.080
And just for you, because I like you a lot, I reread these articles before recording this

06:52.080 --> 06:56.160
video, and I am happy to report that just as I remembered them, they contain absolutely

06:56.160 --> 06:57.620
nothing of value.

06:57.620 --> 07:03.600
But from that entire lesson, there is one kernel of truth that I think is worth discussing.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.320
And it is that play is subversive.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.580
And of course it is.

07:07.580 --> 07:09.720
Play is where the rules get loosened a bit.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.200
It's where you can push the boundaries with minimal harm.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.800
It's where you can compete at something that is low stakes.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.400
It's where you explore and go on adventures.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.920
Playing is like dreaming, in that it's a realm where wacky things can happen, and you can

07:21.920 --> 07:23.720
test your reactions to them.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.380
It's where new ideas appear.

07:25.380 --> 07:27.920
It's the boundary between the physical and the psychological.

07:27.920 --> 07:32.500
It makes a lot of sense to me that the play impulse shares a heavy overlap with the sexual

07:32.500 --> 07:33.500
impulse.

07:33.500 --> 07:37.960
The action of play overrides the intention of the toy, in some sense.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.860
The professor of the class, while going over that ridiculous Barbie essay, pointed out

07:41.860 --> 07:46.300
that despite the unrealistic beauty standards of the Barbie doll, the gender roles it impressed

07:46.300 --> 07:51.260
upon the young girls playing with them, and other such tabula rasa nonsense, a lot of

07:51.260 --> 07:54.000
little girls play with Barbies incorrectly.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.040
That is, they don't only play house with them, or whatever.

07:57.040 --> 08:00.200
They'll pop their arms off in a pretend gruesome car accident.

08:00.200 --> 08:02.520
They'll cut their hair into weird styles.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.080
They'll throw them around the room.

08:04.080 --> 08:08.580
They'll make them say stuff completely out of character for the approved Barbie personality.

08:08.580 --> 08:11.700
And that is because play is subversive.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.880
If your culture hands a child a toy that is designed to teach them specific lessons about

08:15.880 --> 08:20.280
how to be an adult, there's a high chance that if left to their own devices, the child

08:20.280 --> 08:22.160
will make up their own rules instead.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.400
I think this is why we have so much nostalgia for an era where we were left alone to play

08:25.400 --> 08:26.400
video games.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.840
Where the games lacked a political message, and there was no reason to think about anything

08:29.840 --> 08:31.260
other than going on an adventure.

08:31.260 --> 08:35.480
We weren't being told what to think, beyond the basic world building of the game, and

08:35.480 --> 08:37.200
the role we were asked to inhabit.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.840
It's not sexist that Mario saves the princess, it simply is.

08:40.840 --> 08:44.880
And we know this to be the case, because when we turned on Metroid, nobody actually thought,

08:44.880 --> 08:46.440
why am I playing the role of the Kidnappy?

08:46.440 --> 08:50.360
When I took that class and read those essays and listened to that professor blather on,

08:50.360 --> 08:54.160
it was in an era where video games were still largely devoid of SJWs.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.960
Yes, I'm that old.

08:55.960 --> 09:00.840
And the class, the essays, and the lecture revolved around how play was subversive, and

09:00.840 --> 09:05.640
the implication was that play was the tool we would use to subvert the cultural hegemony.

09:05.640 --> 09:09.840
It didn't matter if the makers of the Barbie dolls and the dump truck toys intended to

09:09.840 --> 09:14.560
teach children strict gender roles, because we played with them our way, not theirs.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.280
We would take away our values, not theirs.

09:17.280 --> 09:21.840
And then, when we entered the workforce, we would implement our values, not theirs.

09:21.840 --> 09:26.760
And now that my classmates have done the subverting, they've seized power in entertainment, in

09:26.760 --> 09:27.760
games and movies.

09:27.760 --> 09:33.000
They understand full well that play is subversive, that their hard work can be undone by their

09:33.000 --> 09:35.760
own customers refusing to play by their rules.

09:35.760 --> 09:41.480
So, of course, you're not welcome to play Warhammer or Vampire or Cthulhu or D&D if

09:41.480 --> 09:43.280
you don't have the correct thinking.

09:43.280 --> 09:48.520
Of course, the games need to be changed to add player consent forms, and wheelchair accessible

09:48.520 --> 09:53.440
dungeons, and altering how race works as a mechanic, and adding heavy-handed disclaimers

09:53.440 --> 09:57.460
about how awful and culturally insensitive their old content used to be.

09:57.460 --> 10:01.780
In order to prevent the subversion of play, the subverters are doing everything short

10:01.780 --> 10:05.360
of telling people that you are just no longer allowed to play the old versions of their

10:05.360 --> 10:06.360
games.

10:06.360 --> 10:09.040
And some of them are even starting to do that too, looking at you Blizzard.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.440
The Extra Credits video has this to say about biological essentialism.

10:12.440 --> 10:17.740
This idea that a certain subgroup, like race, nationality or sex, has inalienable traits

10:17.740 --> 10:22.560
is called biological essentialism or simply bio-essentialism, and it's a valid way to

10:22.560 --> 10:26.800
talk about qualities like how many legs an animal has or whether it can fly.

10:26.800 --> 10:31.400
But all too often, this concept gets misused in untrue statements, like pit bulls are a

10:31.400 --> 10:35.660
violent breed, men are more logical than women, or Asians are better at math.

10:35.660 --> 10:39.280
Now chances are, if a game is set in the real world, that the designers are avoiding these

10:39.280 --> 10:43.800
tropes because they aren't real, as multiple fields of societal and hard science can readily

10:43.800 --> 10:44.800
prove to you.

10:44.800 --> 10:49.880
But speculative fiction offers us an opportunity to reify or make real various things which

10:49.880 --> 10:53.200
don't exist or to exaggerate things which do.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.480
Basically if a character is intelligent enough to be considered a person with rights and

10:56.480 --> 11:01.160
responsibilities within their society, then they are somehow magically unshackled from

11:01.160 --> 11:02.160
their biology.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.800
The leftist position is that the physical differences between the races should no longer

11:05.800 --> 11:06.800
matter.

11:06.800 --> 11:11.760
Both those differences created wildly different brains, because it's ultimately the collectivist

11:11.760 --> 11:16.180
position that the will is separate from the body, not strictly leftist, for example religious

11:16.180 --> 11:19.680
people on the right often say that the soul is separate from the body.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.120
Meanwhile people on the left often pretend that they're purely rational and that their

11:23.120 --> 11:26.400
emotions never get the better of them or ever influence their decision making.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.120
Both of these positions, even though they are politically at odds with one another,

11:30.120 --> 11:31.600
appeal to the same flaw.

11:31.600 --> 11:37.360
The idea that your brain is hardware and your personality or your soul or your consciousness

11:37.360 --> 11:41.440
or your will or whatever is software running on the hardware.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.200
But we know that to be incorrect.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.620
Your will is not separate from your body.

11:45.620 --> 11:46.620
You are your brain.

11:46.620 --> 11:54.280
And as a quick side note, research into artificial intelligence has hit such insurmountable roadblocks

11:54.280 --> 12:01.000
because we are rapidly discovering that an intelligence without a body is almost non-functional.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.500
There has to be some sense of self, there has to be some way to identify what is you

12:05.500 --> 12:07.000
and what is not you.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.160
And significant advancements in creating an actual generalized AI is only starting to

12:12.160 --> 12:18.360
come about because we have made robot bodies, rather than simply programming them on computers.

12:18.360 --> 12:23.120
Extra Credits even refers to Mass Effect in his video, a setting where it makes even less

12:23.120 --> 12:27.920
sense to talk about biological essentialism than in D&D, because the various alien races

12:27.920 --> 12:32.640
within the Mass Effect universe are biologically distinct to the point that, with a few specific

12:32.640 --> 12:37.240
exceptions, there is no Star Trek style procreation between them.

12:37.240 --> 12:41.480
There's no way that their brains function the same way to the point that their natures,

12:41.480 --> 12:46.200
biological urges, thought processes and so on are equalized for the sake of surface level

12:46.200 --> 12:47.200
political correctness.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.140
Speaking of Star Trek, that's literally how it works over there.

12:50.140 --> 12:53.380
Almost all of the aliens in Star Trek are just humans wearing different hats.

12:53.380 --> 12:56.960
The Klingons and Vulcans might be physically stronger, the Pakleds seem to be naturally

12:56.960 --> 13:00.380
stupid, but beyond that, every other difference is surface level.

13:00.380 --> 13:04.400
It doesn't matter that Ferengi have erogenous zones on their ears, because what really makes

13:04.400 --> 13:07.200
the Ferengi distinct in the show is their corporatism.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.400
And through the show we see that's entirely culturally constructed.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.720
Nearly every Cardassian that we meet is a legitimate state-worshipping fascist, but

13:14.720 --> 13:17.840
the show points out that that too is culturally constructed.

13:17.840 --> 13:22.760
With just a few exceptions, the differences in race are cultural, and it would make little

13:22.760 --> 13:26.960
sense to appeal to biology if you were playing a game set in Star Trek's universe.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.640
In Mass Effect it's the complete opposite.

13:28.640 --> 13:32.520
The biological differences are so vast that the species in fact matter quite a bit.

13:32.520 --> 13:36.880
You cannot make Aquarian survive without their bio-suit solely through cultural change.

13:36.880 --> 13:41.400
In other words, this is a lefty complaining about biological essentialism in an area where

13:41.400 --> 13:45.920
it actually really makes sense to be biologically essentialist, way more so than it does with

13:45.920 --> 13:47.880
real-life races of humans.

13:47.880 --> 13:52.180
And to your average everyday normie, it looks like they're doing it for woke points.

13:52.180 --> 13:55.260
In fact, they probably think they're doing it for woke points.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.880
I doubt they've read Barbie in Black and White.

13:57.880 --> 14:03.120
But the philosophy that drives this sort of stuff is ultimately a kind of cultural conformity.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.120
Think of it like this.

14:04.120 --> 14:07.280
When you go to a scary movie, you're going there to be scared.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.780
You're going so that you may immerse yourself in a reality that doesn't actually exist

14:10.780 --> 14:14.800
for you in that time and that place, so that you may feel being scared without actually

14:14.800 --> 14:16.380
being in the situation personally.

14:16.380 --> 14:20.080
Your politics don't matter, what's going on outside of the movie doesn't matter.

14:20.080 --> 14:23.800
And the one thing that would take you out of it more than anything else would be a constant

14:23.800 --> 14:28.340
glaring reminder in the corner of the screen saying, this is not real.

14:28.340 --> 14:32.900
That is the practical end result of the everything is political style of storytelling.

14:32.900 --> 14:37.820
If the creator's politics are so immensely important, and socialists and SJWs surely

14:37.820 --> 14:42.680
do believe that they are, why would they ever give you a way to escape them in their escapism?

14:42.680 --> 14:47.520
Why would they allow the subversion of play to give you an opportunity to unwind, to detox,

14:47.520 --> 14:49.560
to be exposed to an alternative narrative?

14:49.560 --> 14:53.720
Why wouldn't they want every single bit of entertainment to be twisted towards their

14:53.720 --> 14:56.480
position so that there's no rest from the propaganda?

14:56.480 --> 15:01.640
Why wouldn't every video game, tabletop game, movie, TV show feature only the proper politics?

15:01.640 --> 15:06.600
And if for some reason it could not, instead feature giant red flashing warning signs that

15:06.600 --> 15:10.580
scream this is bad, don't be problematic over and over.

15:10.580 --> 15:14.220
Why would the world of pretend be a refuge from the real world?

15:14.220 --> 15:16.880
With this in mind, you can now understand their moves.

15:16.880 --> 15:21.300
In this type of environment, of course they would say, Warhammer is for everyone, or tabletop

15:21.300 --> 15:24.480
is for everyone, video games are for everyone, etc, etc.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.440
So that as many people as possible absorb their pre-approved politics.

15:28.440 --> 15:34.000
In a free liberal society, Warhammer would not actually be for everyone, sorry to say.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.280
Instead, Warhammer would be for anyone, not everyone.

15:37.280 --> 15:40.440
It would be for people who like Warhammer, or might like Warhammer.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.880
And there's no reason for Warhammer to pander to people who don't like it.

15:43.880 --> 15:47.080
Unless of course the end goal is not the game, but the politics.

15:47.080 --> 15:51.840
These people already know how subversive play is, they know how it can change minds and

15:51.840 --> 15:55.520
destroy cultures, which is why they will only let you play by their rules.

15:55.520 --> 16:00.320
Extra Credits is just the next useless idiot in a very, very long line of useless idiots,

16:00.320 --> 16:03.360
who thinks that they're saying something smart and progressive, but are ultimately just another

16:03.360 --> 16:04.360
part of the problem.

16:04.360 --> 16:07.440
I wouldn't worry too much about it though, they're lefty YouTubers after all.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.720
I'd wager that the inevitable allegations against them will probably roll in in the

16:10.720 --> 16:13.720
next few years, and then they'll just be cancelled by the very same culture that they

16:13.760 --> 16:15.280
helped to create.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.000
