0	10860	Alright, we've all heard of that cancerous extra credits video that just came out, right?
10860	13120	Evil Race is our bad game design?
13120	15140	You know, with bangers like this?
15140	19280	Much of the recent conversation on Orcs points out that characterizing a whole species in
19280	24200	your game as ugly, warlike, and malevolent might be harmful to real-world groups regularly
24200	27240	mischaracterized as ugly, warlike, and malevolent.
27240	33520	Yeah, um, back when I played Warcraft, I didn't really look at this and think it was this.
33520	38160	Even when they introduced brown orcs, I still didn't really get the feeling that there was
38160	41800	some kind of hidden racist author whispering in my ear,
41800	44960	hey, this is actually about black people.
44960	46960	Some people did though, like this person.
46960	50560	Non-binary, 22, guitarist, gamer, and leftist.
50560	52880	Anti-fascism is self-defense.
52880	57160	Orcs are clearly supposed to be black people even though they're a fantasy race from
57160	58440	a fictional world.
58440	64040	It would seem that it takes a specific personality type, maybe even a specific type of politics,
64040	65960	to view orcs as black people.
65960	70000	And for the rest of us, maybe we just accept that it's a fantasy setting because we don't
70000	74840	have our heads so far up our own asses that we're tongue-fucking our lunch.
74840	76800	But this discourse isn't new.
76800	82620	Like a year ago, Sofia Narwhits got dogpiled for saying that gatekeeping your hobbies from
82620	84680	leftist corruption is a good thing.
84680	89360	After a crowd of concave brains started complaining about the skin colour of orcs and dark elves
89360	90360	and shit.
90360	92640	It's okay dude, it's a fantasy setting, you'll survive.
92640	93640	Guess what?
93640	98360	In Sargon's Crusaders campaign, it was Arab-looking people who made up the bulk of the medieval
98360	103760	feudalistic society, while the redheads and gingers were uncontacted tribesmen a continent
103760	104880	away, and that's okay.
104880	109460	I didn't get offended by it and have a massive breakdown just because I shared my skin colour
109460	110460	with them.
110460	112360	And that's the core of this discussion.
112360	116760	Not every idea needs to be autistically pushed to its natural end result.
116760	119480	Not every stone needs to be overturned.
119480	121320	Sometimes you can just compromise.
121320	122520	Sometimes you can just let things be.
122520	124080	Let me show you what I mean.
124080	129760	Rule Zero, the idea that the GM can bend the rules in the name of fun, is toxic.
129760	131440	Played by the word of God only.
131440	135380	Everything must be strictly regimented and codified, sanitized and scientific.
135380	137120	And that includes your game nights.
137120	138720	The rulebook is law.
138720	139720	Hot take.
139720	143960	The idea for stats is neutral at best and toxic at worst.
143960	145120	Randomness is not fair.
145120	147140	Unfairness is not equal.
147140	149160	Fun is secondary to equality.
149160	153120	How tabletop RPGs are being reclaimed from bigots and jerks.
153120	157720	Cthulhu, the horror game where you slowly go insane from encountering the elder gods?
157720	159080	Well that's ableist.
159080	161560	So now it's a generic time traveling action romp.
161560	165440	Vampire the Masquerade, the game where you literally play the villain?
165440	167560	The unholy cursed living dead?
167560	169100	Well that's fascist.
169100	171140	But now every character is woke as fuck.
171140	175180	Dungeons and Dragons, claiming that races have an evil alignment?
175180	176420	Or an evil nature?
176420	178380	Or hell, a nature at all?
178380	180520	Well of course, that's racist.
180520	183260	The people who complain about any of this are missing the point.
183260	186940	A game is where you do things that you wouldn't do in real life.
186940	190520	It's where you step into the role of somebody you specifically aren't, and explore those
190520	191520	ideas.
191520	196060	I have never been an obese jolly monk, or a loli vampire soldier, or a homeless half
196060	197180	elf wildling.
197180	199740	It's like I've never been the hero of time, or the vault dweller.
199740	203580	Part of playing any game is putting yourself into situations you would never actually get
203580	204580	into otherwise.
204580	209620	I did a video about this last year, where leftists got ass mad that Arch Sargon V Oozaloo
209620	214820	Rags and I played a game of Vampire the Masquerade, where we basically abandoned most of the VTM
214820	219820	lore and just adapted the game's systems to play as secret Nazi vampire super soldiers.
219820	221740	That was the game where I was the loli by the way.
221740	226220	Those complaining busy body leftists missed the point, obviously, because we were playing
226220	227540	a villainous campaign.
227540	231260	You'd think the whole vampire thing would get that across, but that was offensive to
231260	235620	these people, and surely was a sign that we were hidden fascists ourselves in real life.
235620	239740	Of course if we were to play as a secret communist vampire super soldiers, nobody would be saying
239740	243580	that we were hidden socialists or something like that, nor would any of us be called secret
243580	246620	Nazis if we played as a Nazi soldier during a World War 2 shooter.
246620	250420	We're talking about people who have never even heard of Ilsa She-Wolf of the SS, or
250420	255740	watched Hellsing with their over the top, extremely evil and yet simultaneously absurd
255740	257220	portrayal of Nazis.
257220	262500	And yes Hellsing fans, when your neo-nazi consists of a Hitler Youth Catboy, there is
262500	263860	some absurdity there.
263860	267980	The point I'm making is that you do not play Nazis in a game because you are one, but rather
267980	269540	because you are not one.
269540	272240	That's the point of exploring this kind of evil.
272240	276380	Most of these leftists who complained, SJWs, socialists, whatever you want to call them,
276380	281420	if they were in Germany during the Second World War, they would be Auschwitz camp guards,
281420	282420	and they would enjoy it.
282420	286420	It's not about the political difference, not really, it's about their psychology, their
286420	287420	personality.
287420	289420	They are a pathology looking for a cause.
289420	292340	And the original creators of Vampire the Masquerade knew this.
292340	295740	In VTM's first edition, the disclaimer in the book says,
295740	299580	The themes and issues described in this game may be disturbing to some and distasteful
299580	302720	to others, though our purpose is not to offend.
302720	307940	Our use of the vampire as a metaphor and as a channel for storytelling may be misconstrued.
307940	310240	To be clear, vampires are not real.
310240	314000	The extent to which they can be said to exist is revealed only in what they can teach us
314000	317720	of the human condition and of the fragility of the splendor which we call life.
317720	319200	A completely reasonable statement.
319200	322900	There's edgy shit in the game, some of you may not like it, don't play it if you're squeamish.
322900	326900	There is evil here, not because we're evil, but because we are exploring evil.
326900	328280	So that we may be good.
328280	333720	To contrast, the newest edition of VTM contains several pages about how fascists, aka people
333720	337620	who object to minorities punching up, yes it really says that, are not allowed to play
337620	338620	the game.
338620	341820	And that the game is about monsters, don't be a monster yourself, as if that even has
341820	342820	to be said.
342820	345840	The same thing happened with Warhammer, when Arch was getting cancelled over some obvious
345840	347000	nonsense last year.
347000	351640	The statement from Warhammer is that Warhammer is for everyone, and that our fantasy settings
351640	356200	are grim and dark, but that is not a reflection of who we are or how we feel the real world
356200	357200	should be.
357200	361960	Like, people actually believed these guys wanted to implement the Imperium of Man IRL.
361960	366560	Like people actually thought White Wolf wanted to create vampires who would run the entirety
366560	368740	of society from behind the scenes.
368740	370800	Why does this nonsense even need to be said?
370800	373800	I'm not actually off on a tangent right now, though maybe it sounds like I am.
373800	378520	And the reason is, I think I actually have an answer to that question, why does this
378520	379880	even need to be said?
379880	382360	And it ties all the way back to that dumb video from Extra Credits.
382360	385440	If you've been watching me for a while, you know that I took a lot of lefty classes
385440	386440	in university.
386680	390920	In one of these classes, the topic of the day was the culture of play, and we had to
390920	392920	read these essays.
392920	396660	Look at the names of this garbage, Barbie in black and white, making sense of the modern
396660	397660	toy box.
397660	402320	It was honestly all just intersectional junk, and I really regret wasting the time and money
402320	403360	that I spent on it.
403360	407860	And hey, if you don't mind helping me recoup it, you can always hit up my subscribe star.
407860	412080	And just for you, because I like you a lot, I reread these articles before recording this
412080	416160	video, and I am happy to report that just as I remembered them, they contain absolutely
416160	417620	nothing of value.
417620	423600	But from that entire lesson, there is one kernel of truth that I think is worth discussing.
423600	426320	And it is that play is subversive.
426320	427580	And of course it is.
427580	429720	Play is where the rules get loosened a bit.
429720	432200	It's where you can push the boundaries with minimal harm.
432200	434800	It's where you can compete at something that is low stakes.
434800	437400	It's where you explore and go on adventures.
437400	441920	Playing is like dreaming, in that it's a realm where wacky things can happen, and you can
441920	443720	test your reactions to them.
443720	445380	It's where new ideas appear.
445380	447920	It's the boundary between the physical and the psychological.
447920	452500	It makes a lot of sense to me that the play impulse shares a heavy overlap with the sexual
452500	453500	impulse.
453500	457960	The action of play overrides the intention of the toy, in some sense.
457960	461860	The professor of the class, while going over that ridiculous Barbie essay, pointed out
461860	466300	that despite the unrealistic beauty standards of the Barbie doll, the gender roles it impressed
466300	471260	upon the young girls playing with them, and other such tabula rasa nonsense, a lot of
471260	474000	little girls play with Barbies incorrectly.
474000	477040	That is, they don't only play house with them, or whatever.
477040	480200	They'll pop their arms off in a pretend gruesome car accident.
480200	482520	They'll cut their hair into weird styles.
482520	484080	They'll throw them around the room.
484080	488580	They'll make them say stuff completely out of character for the approved Barbie personality.
488580	491700	And that is because play is subversive.
491700	495880	If your culture hands a child a toy that is designed to teach them specific lessons about
495880	500280	how to be an adult, there's a high chance that if left to their own devices, the child
500280	502160	will make up their own rules instead.
502160	505400	I think this is why we have so much nostalgia for an era where we were left alone to play
505400	506400	video games.
506400	509840	Where the games lacked a political message, and there was no reason to think about anything
509840	511260	other than going on an adventure.
511260	515480	We weren't being told what to think, beyond the basic world building of the game, and
515480	517200	the role we were asked to inhabit.
517200	520840	It's not sexist that Mario saves the princess, it simply is.
520840	524880	And we know this to be the case, because when we turned on Metroid, nobody actually thought,
524880	526440	why am I playing the role of the Kidnappy?
526440	530360	When I took that class and read those essays and listened to that professor blather on,
530360	534160	it was in an era where video games were still largely devoid of SJWs.
534160	535960	Yes, I'm that old.
535960	540840	And the class, the essays, and the lecture revolved around how play was subversive, and
540840	545640	the implication was that play was the tool we would use to subvert the cultural hegemony.
545640	549840	It didn't matter if the makers of the Barbie dolls and the dump truck toys intended to
549840	554560	teach children strict gender roles, because we played with them our way, not theirs.
554560	557280	We would take away our values, not theirs.
557280	561840	And then, when we entered the workforce, we would implement our values, not theirs.
561840	566760	And now that my classmates have done the subverting, they've seized power in entertainment, in
566760	567760	games and movies.
567760	573000	They understand full well that play is subversive, that their hard work can be undone by their
573000	575760	own customers refusing to play by their rules.
575760	581480	So, of course, you're not welcome to play Warhammer or Vampire or Cthulhu or D&D if
581480	583280	you don't have the correct thinking.
583280	588520	Of course, the games need to be changed to add player consent forms, and wheelchair accessible
588520	593440	dungeons, and altering how race works as a mechanic, and adding heavy-handed disclaimers
593440	597460	about how awful and culturally insensitive their old content used to be.
597460	601780	In order to prevent the subversion of play, the subverters are doing everything short
601780	605360	of telling people that you are just no longer allowed to play the old versions of their
605360	606360	games.
606360	609040	And some of them are even starting to do that too, looking at you Blizzard.
609040	612440	The Extra Credits video has this to say about biological essentialism.
612440	617740	This idea that a certain subgroup, like race, nationality or sex, has inalienable traits
617740	622560	is called biological essentialism or simply bio-essentialism, and it's a valid way to
622560	626800	talk about qualities like how many legs an animal has or whether it can fly.
626800	631400	But all too often, this concept gets misused in untrue statements, like pit bulls are a
631400	635660	violent breed, men are more logical than women, or Asians are better at math.
635660	639280	Now chances are, if a game is set in the real world, that the designers are avoiding these
639280	643800	tropes because they aren't real, as multiple fields of societal and hard science can readily
643800	644800	prove to you.
644800	649880	But speculative fiction offers us an opportunity to reify or make real various things which
649880	653200	don't exist or to exaggerate things which do.
653200	656480	Basically if a character is intelligent enough to be considered a person with rights and
656480	661160	responsibilities within their society, then they are somehow magically unshackled from
661160	662160	their biology.
662160	665800	The leftist position is that the physical differences between the races should no longer
665800	666800	matter.
666800	671760	Both those differences created wildly different brains, because it's ultimately the collectivist
671760	676180	position that the will is separate from the body, not strictly leftist, for example religious
676180	679680	people on the right often say that the soul is separate from the body.
679680	683120	Meanwhile people on the left often pretend that they're purely rational and that their
683120	686400	emotions never get the better of them or ever influence their decision making.
686400	690120	Both of these positions, even though they are politically at odds with one another,
690120	691600	appeal to the same flaw.
691600	697360	The idea that your brain is hardware and your personality or your soul or your consciousness
697360	701440	or your will or whatever is software running on the hardware.
701440	703200	But we know that to be incorrect.
703200	705620	Your will is not separate from your body.
705620	706620	You are your brain.
706620	714280	And as a quick side note, research into artificial intelligence has hit such insurmountable roadblocks
714280	721000	because we are rapidly discovering that an intelligence without a body is almost non-functional.
721000	725500	There has to be some sense of self, there has to be some way to identify what is you
725500	727000	and what is not you.
727000	732160	And significant advancements in creating an actual generalized AI is only starting to
732160	738360	come about because we have made robot bodies, rather than simply programming them on computers.
738360	743120	Extra Credits even refers to Mass Effect in his video, a setting where it makes even less
743120	747920	sense to talk about biological essentialism than in D&D, because the various alien races
747920	752640	within the Mass Effect universe are biologically distinct to the point that, with a few specific
752640	757240	exceptions, there is no Star Trek style procreation between them.
757240	761480	There's no way that their brains function the same way to the point that their natures,
761480	766200	biological urges, thought processes and so on are equalized for the sake of surface level
766200	767200	political correctness.
767200	770140	Speaking of Star Trek, that's literally how it works over there.
770140	773380	Almost all of the aliens in Star Trek are just humans wearing different hats.
773380	776960	The Klingons and Vulcans might be physically stronger, the Pakleds seem to be naturally
776960	780380	stupid, but beyond that, every other difference is surface level.
780380	784400	It doesn't matter that Ferengi have erogenous zones on their ears, because what really makes
784400	787200	the Ferengi distinct in the show is their corporatism.
787200	790400	And through the show we see that's entirely culturally constructed.
790400	794720	Nearly every Cardassian that we meet is a legitimate state-worshipping fascist, but
794720	797840	the show points out that that too is culturally constructed.
797840	802760	With just a few exceptions, the differences in race are cultural, and it would make little
802760	806960	sense to appeal to biology if you were playing a game set in Star Trek's universe.
806960	808640	In Mass Effect it's the complete opposite.
808640	812520	The biological differences are so vast that the species in fact matter quite a bit.
812520	816880	You cannot make Aquarian survive without their bio-suit solely through cultural change.
816880	821400	In other words, this is a lefty complaining about biological essentialism in an area where
821400	825920	it actually really makes sense to be biologically essentialist, way more so than it does with
825920	827880	real-life races of humans.
827880	832180	And to your average everyday normie, it looks like they're doing it for woke points.
832180	835260	In fact, they probably think they're doing it for woke points.
835260	837880	I doubt they've read Barbie in Black and White.
837880	843120	But the philosophy that drives this sort of stuff is ultimately a kind of cultural conformity.
843120	844120	Think of it like this.
844120	847280	When you go to a scary movie, you're going there to be scared.
847280	850780	You're going so that you may immerse yourself in a reality that doesn't actually exist
850780	854800	for you in that time and that place, so that you may feel being scared without actually
854800	856380	being in the situation personally.
856380	860080	Your politics don't matter, what's going on outside of the movie doesn't matter.
860080	863800	And the one thing that would take you out of it more than anything else would be a constant
863800	868340	glaring reminder in the corner of the screen saying, this is not real.
868340	872900	That is the practical end result of the everything is political style of storytelling.
872900	877820	If the creator's politics are so immensely important, and socialists and SJWs surely
877820	882680	do believe that they are, why would they ever give you a way to escape them in their escapism?
882680	887520	Why would they allow the subversion of play to give you an opportunity to unwind, to detox,
887520	889560	to be exposed to an alternative narrative?
889560	893720	Why wouldn't they want every single bit of entertainment to be twisted towards their
893720	896480	position so that there's no rest from the propaganda?
896480	901640	Why wouldn't every video game, tabletop game, movie, TV show feature only the proper politics?
901640	906600	And if for some reason it could not, instead feature giant red flashing warning signs that
906600	910580	scream this is bad, don't be problematic over and over.
910580	914220	Why would the world of pretend be a refuge from the real world?
914220	916880	With this in mind, you can now understand their moves.
916880	921300	In this type of environment, of course they would say, Warhammer is for everyone, or tabletop
921300	924480	is for everyone, video games are for everyone, etc, etc.
924480	928440	So that as many people as possible absorb their pre-approved politics.
928440	934000	In a free liberal society, Warhammer would not actually be for everyone, sorry to say.
934000	937280	Instead, Warhammer would be for anyone, not everyone.
937280	940440	It would be for people who like Warhammer, or might like Warhammer.
940440	943880	And there's no reason for Warhammer to pander to people who don't like it.
943880	947080	Unless of course the end goal is not the game, but the politics.
947080	951840	These people already know how subversive play is, they know how it can change minds and
951840	955520	destroy cultures, which is why they will only let you play by their rules.
955520	960320	Extra Credits is just the next useless idiot in a very, very long line of useless idiots,
960320	963360	who thinks that they're saying something smart and progressive, but are ultimately just another
963360	964360	part of the problem.
964360	967440	I wouldn't worry too much about it though, they're lefty YouTubers after all.
967440	970720	I'd wager that the inevitable allegations against them will probably roll in in the
970720	973720	next few years, and then they'll just be cancelled by the very same culture that they
973760	975280	helped to create.
