00:00.000 --> 00:10.160
In Vosch's debate with Count Dankula over whether or not Dankula was a white supremacist the point

00:10.160 --> 00:14.880
was made that talking about things like policy or opinions with a white supremacist was pointless

00:14.880 --> 00:20.800
because they would just lie and so Vosch starting from the position that Dankula was a hidden white

00:20.800 --> 00:25.920
supremacist a crypto supremacist if you will didn't actually want to ask relevant questions

00:26.080 --> 00:30.640
but simply say shit like you told a racist joke therefore you're a racist

00:30.640 --> 00:34.480
I made racist jokes in the past doesn't mean that I'm racist they're just jokes

00:36.080 --> 00:42.880
right so I want to open up oh sorry I've got a way to sort of do that straight now you feel

00:42.880 --> 00:48.640
that there's certain beliefs that obviously that white supremacists have correct uh well

00:48.640 --> 00:55.680
yeah I mean they'd have to well why not ask me if I believe in those things oh sure yeah

00:56.080 --> 01:00.400
the answer is because I think you guys lie because you're spineless cowards that's the main reason

01:01.040 --> 01:05.200
this is something Vosch would repeat in his conversation with Lilith only now Dankula's

01:05.200 --> 01:09.520
graduated from white supremacist to fascist do you people like Count Dankula for example

01:09.520 --> 01:14.960
who like when he makes comments that like seem openly fash it's always like a joke and he can

01:14.960 --> 01:20.160
walk it back but his audience loves those comments they're not joking they like it you know but but

01:20.640 --> 01:27.840
he's joking wink well I I mean me personally I think he's a fascist or he's not ideologically

01:28.400 --> 01:32.240
consistent enough to know that he is but from what I've seen that seems to be like the underlying

01:32.240 --> 01:37.040
political message that he's pushed and hey I'm thrown in there as well I know short fat otaku

01:37.040 --> 01:40.880
does this to some extent as well and there are other prominent libertarians who I think kind of

01:40.880 --> 01:45.280
play cover a lot you know I mean I'm not even conservative republican or a libertarian if you

01:45.280 --> 01:49.360
watch enough of Vosch's content you see this sort of thing repeated over and over to the point that

01:49.360 --> 01:54.560
he now believes that all conservatives all republicans all libertarians and pretty much

01:54.560 --> 02:00.560
almost everybody who is to the right of him are fascists if you have a conservative family member

02:00.560 --> 02:03.760
I'm sorry they're part of the problem if you a conservative friend I'm sorry they're part of the

02:03.760 --> 02:09.520
problem and every conservative every republican is on the hook for this every last one of them

02:09.520 --> 02:15.040
people will be treating maga material the exact same way we treat holocaust or world war II or

02:15.040 --> 02:20.640
vermont or ss materials today at some point Vosch has also said something to the effect of

02:20.640 --> 02:26.160
fascism isn't a coherent political ideology it's simply a naked power grab that adopts the rhetoric

02:26.160 --> 02:30.080
of other philosophies as a means to an end while not actually implementing the goals of those

02:30.080 --> 02:35.040
philosophies and no I don't have a clip for this one you can only watch so much brain rot at once

02:35.040 --> 02:40.480
but his video about social fascism contains a bit that has a lot of the same spirit fascism is a

02:40.480 --> 02:46.720
disease it's a creeping mold that spreads from person to person using ideas like nationalism

02:46.720 --> 02:52.240
and racism as vectors and every once in a while you get a you want to call it a super spreader

02:52.240 --> 02:58.240
like QAnon you get these wacky ideas and you can spread to many people very quickly but it always

02:58.240 --> 03:04.080
requires a bad idea and it spreads Vosch's guiding thesis here is that fascism is subversive that

03:04.080 --> 03:09.760
it's incoherent it has no real political philosophy so it lies about everything in its

03:09.760 --> 03:16.000
attempt to overthrow liberal democracy and Vosch is correct but he's correct for the wrong reasons

03:16.000 --> 03:20.240
consider the claim that fascism has no real canon it's not just Vosch this is a common belief among

03:20.240 --> 03:23.760
socialists look online wherever this sort of discussion is happening you'll hear about

03:23.760 --> 03:29.280
subversive fascists co-opting socialist language or how fascism is inherently contradictory some

03:29.280 --> 03:33.840
of the socialists I've talked to on this channel have said that as well fascism is kind of like

03:33.840 --> 03:41.840
very incoherent in its uh philosophy um a lot of it is like complete nonsense the problem is

03:41.840 --> 03:46.160
it isn't really true but I can tell you at least one of the reasons why they think that

03:46.160 --> 03:50.800
Wikipedia yeah I've had this passage quoted to me by commies more times than I can count

03:50.800 --> 03:55.840
this is from Giovanni Gentile's Wikipedia page the philosopher of fascism with gentile and with

03:55.840 --> 04:01.040
fascism the problem of the party existed by virtue of the fact that the fascist party arose

04:01.040 --> 04:05.280
organically rather than from a tracked or pre-established sociopolitical doctrine

04:05.280 --> 04:09.680
this complicated the matter for gentile as it left no consensus to any way of thinking among

04:09.680 --> 04:14.960
the fascists but ironically this aspect was to gentile's view of how a state or party doctrine

04:14.960 --> 04:20.000
should live out its existence with natural organic growth and dialectical opposition intact

04:20.000 --> 04:24.640
a dialectical opposition they're referencing Hegel's thesis antithesis synthesis method

04:24.640 --> 04:29.600
gentile like Marx was a neo-hagalian philosopher this objection seems to stem from the observation

04:29.600 --> 04:34.080
as well as gentile's own acceptance of that observation that fascism arose organically

04:34.080 --> 04:38.000
without a guiding philosophy rather than a philosophy first being written and then a

04:38.000 --> 04:42.640
social movement following it a Marxist critique of fascism is that this lack of a philosophical

04:42.640 --> 04:47.440
basis leads to a fundamental irrationality within fascist movements creating a vacuum that almost

04:47.440 --> 04:51.920
inevitably boils down to raw power as justification for their existence and you have to admit there

04:51.920 --> 04:56.720
is something to this view but again it's not the whole story socialists commonly regurgitate

04:56.720 --> 05:00.880
their misreading of the wikipedia passage in order to win twitter debates but none of them

05:00.880 --> 05:04.560
will actually read the whole article as being quoted presumably because none of them have a

05:04.560 --> 05:08.560
login to j store i still do though to be honest i thought it would have been canceled by now i've

05:08.560 --> 05:12.560
been at school for like eight years the truth is the reference text is literally called the

05:12.560 --> 05:16.960
problem of the party in italian fascism published in the journal of contemporary history volume 9

05:16.960 --> 05:21.920
number 2 april of 1984 by emilio gentile no relation to giovanni gentile by the way it's

05:21.920 --> 05:26.080
a funny coincidence that italy's philosopher of fascism as a political movement as well as italy's

05:26.080 --> 05:31.200
foremost scholar of fascism from historic context both happen to share the same family name but

05:31.200 --> 05:35.680
emilio is a liberal and there really is no political or genetic connection in the article

05:35.680 --> 05:41.760
gentile amelio gentile writes the fascist party was in no sense a homogenous organism not only

05:41.760 --> 05:46.320
because the inevitable mutations which all parties are subject but also because within the structure

05:46.320 --> 05:50.880
and functions of the party there were a number of clearly distinct attitudes and modes of operation

05:50.880 --> 05:55.840
during its history the fascist party underwent a real metamorphosis which substantially modified

05:55.840 --> 05:59.600
its original characteristics without however completely wiping up the typical features by

05:59.600 --> 06:04.160
which its historical identity can be recognized in spite of the structural and functional changes

06:04.160 --> 06:08.640
it would however be superficial to attribute these changes only to circumstance and premeditated

06:08.640 --> 06:13.840
interventions class interests and power plays these changes in fact correspond to a logic

06:13.840 --> 06:18.640
which we might define as specifically totalitarian consistent with the conception of mass politics

06:18.640 --> 06:22.720
characteristic of fascism in other words while the socialists are correct in describing fascism

06:22.720 --> 06:27.200
as growing organically and therefore that method might seem outwardly contradictory and therefore

06:27.200 --> 06:31.840
subversive the socialists are entirely incorrect when they assert that nothing exists below the

06:31.840 --> 06:36.480
surface of fascism no there is certainly a coherent logic it is certainly a thing that

06:36.480 --> 06:41.520
can be concretely identified not simply a vague creeping rot as vosh described it and if these

06:41.520 --> 06:45.760
brainlets ever actually did any reading they'd know that it's actually kind of incredible if

06:45.760 --> 06:50.160
you point out that you've read meinkampf or mussolini's doctrine of fascism or alfredo

06:50.160 --> 06:54.080
rocco's political doctrine of fascism every socialist will scream at you that you're a

06:54.080 --> 06:58.480
crypto fascist if you reply with the obvious response that you're reading about fascism not

06:58.480 --> 07:02.160
because you're a fascist but to learn about fascism the socialist will tell you not to

07:02.160 --> 07:06.480
bother because fascist theory is inherently contradictory and fascists all lie about what

07:06.480 --> 07:11.360
they believe oh also that large swaths of the population are fascist even when they're not

07:11.360 --> 07:19.120
even if they're bad in some other non-fascist way fascism is authoritarianism and conservatism

07:19.760 --> 07:24.480
mixed together that's what fascism is i don't need i don't need this

07:27.280 --> 07:34.240
umberto eco's fucking fucking take on it these same people if you happen to have some

07:34.240 --> 07:38.800
misconceptions about socialism or communism or anarchism they'll demand that you read marx or

07:38.800 --> 07:43.440
kropotkin or proudhon and they will happily love bombingly direct you towards any sources you

07:43.440 --> 07:49.040
require because unlike fascist theorists their guys aren't incoherent their guys wouldn't lie

07:49.680 --> 07:55.680
yeah when somebody tells you to accept their propaganda unthinkingly but don't you dare read

07:55.680 --> 08:00.800
that other guy's heretical works or else you're pure evil who's being the subversive now personally

08:00.800 --> 08:03.520
i would just tell you to read everything read it with a critical eye but read it

08:03.520 --> 08:09.040
nonetheless that being said what the socialists see as irrationality within fascism the fascists

08:09.040 --> 08:14.080
describe themselves as pragmatism in rocco's political doctrine of fascism he states fascism

08:14.080 --> 08:18.000
solves the eternal problem of economic freedom and of state interference considering both as

08:18.000 --> 08:22.400
mere methods which may or may not be employed in accordance with the social needs of the moment

08:22.400 --> 08:26.480
and that fascists differ fundamentally from the liberals the latter see in liberty a principle

08:26.480 --> 08:30.800
the fascists accepted as a method by the liberals freedom is granted in the interest of the citizens

08:30.800 --> 08:35.120
the fascists granted in the interest of society the point here isn't that fascism is contradictory

08:35.120 --> 08:39.200
it's that fascism is a consequentialist ideology happy to use the methods of other political

08:39.200 --> 08:44.400
ideologies if the end result is good for fascism of course considering that a lot of socialists are

08:44.400 --> 08:48.560
die-hard consequentialists it's no wonder they prefer that you not read about this stuff there

08:48.560 --> 08:52.960
are also other theorists and other books they prefer you not read about as well zeve sternhill

08:52.960 --> 08:57.360
a polish born jew who survived the holocaust to become a historian and academic on the topic of

08:57.360 --> 09:02.080
fascism was the first to recognize that fascism was socialist tactics wearing a nationalist

09:02.080 --> 09:06.880
uniform sargon did a premium lotus eaters video on one of his history texts a video i bullied him

09:06.880 --> 09:11.520
for months to make and if you have premium there it's worth a watch sternhill also identified

09:11.520 --> 09:16.720
george sorrell or georges i i can't pronounce french names guys as the missing evolutionary

09:16.720 --> 09:21.600
link between marxism and fascism sorrell was a syndicalist who after observing that the proletariat

09:21.600 --> 09:26.560
did not actually rise up in revolt when called upon to fight the first world war declared marxism

09:26.560 --> 09:31.200
a failure sorrell discovered that the proletariat is always the most reactionary force in any

09:31.200 --> 09:36.240
society and considered marx to be incorrect about the revolutionary potential sorrell also correctly

09:36.240 --> 09:40.640
recognized that the proletariat are often driven to act when they believe in a collective mythos

09:40.640 --> 09:45.600
whether that be the state or the people or the religion sorrell spent much of his life advocating

09:45.600 --> 09:51.040
for socialism achieved through his conception of national syndicalism and both mussolini and

09:51.040 --> 09:55.680
lenin are considered equal successors to cerulean thought for doing what sorrell described as

09:55.680 --> 10:00.640
the union of the national and the social something i have studied without ever developing the idea

10:00.640 --> 10:05.440
sorrell's philosophy acting as the bridge between marxism and fascism is more extensively explored

10:05.440 --> 10:10.480
in james misel's article a premature fascist published in the western political quarterly

10:10.480 --> 10:15.440
volume 3 number one march 1950 and we will absolutely return to sorrell's philosophy in

10:15.440 --> 10:19.440
a future video because there is some interesting stuff in there another common bit of nonsense is

10:19.440 --> 10:25.360
that fascism is somehow capitalism in decay and that late stage capitalism is simply another step

10:25.360 --> 10:28.960
along this inevitable march it should be pointed out that it's no surprise that a proud ethno

10:28.960 --> 10:33.680
nationalist would endorse an economic system whose final form is fascism after all the dictatorial

10:33.680 --> 10:37.360
regimes of franco mussolini and hitler all followed a set pattern an authoritarian

10:37.360 --> 10:40.880
salvation of the capitalist system resulting in their oversight over its industries the issue

10:40.880 --> 10:46.320
with this view is again a lack of knowledge on the part of the socialists if you were to actually

10:46.320 --> 10:51.280
question a breadtuber about this and get a real answer rather than snark and toxicity they would

10:51.280 --> 10:56.560
probably say either one of two things one that the word privatization was literally invented

10:56.560 --> 11:02.160
to describe fascist economics and it wasn't or two they would pull out this mussolini quote

11:02.160 --> 11:06.400
fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is a merger of state

11:06.400 --> 11:10.080
and corporate power and this is where the breadtuber stops reading secure in their

11:10.080 --> 11:14.560
knowledge that corporations are fascist and therefore they're bad but alas it is not so

11:14.560 --> 11:20.000
simple here is how things read when you don't simply stop as soon as your preconceived biases

11:20.000 --> 11:24.720
are confirmed the corporate state considers that private enterprise in the sphere of production

11:24.720 --> 11:29.200
is the most effective and useful instrument in the interest of the nation in view of the fact that

11:29.200 --> 11:34.400
private organization of production is a function of national concern the organizer of the enterprise

11:34.400 --> 11:38.560
is responsible to the state for the direction given to production Giovanni Gentile's philosophy

11:38.560 --> 11:43.760
contained multiple Hegelian innovations to the socialism of old he believed that publicness and

11:43.760 --> 11:49.040
privateness would cease to exist within a fascist system synthesized into a state of incorporation

11:49.040 --> 11:53.760
where everything all people and all property became organs of the state in line with Hegel's

11:53.760 --> 11:58.880
view that the state is the highest embodiment of the divine idea on earth back in a premature

11:58.880 --> 12:03.920
fascist miso states fascism while preserving the framework of capitalism and tolerating the

12:03.920 --> 12:09.280
entrepreneurs and financiers as individuals was destroying their power as a class the fascist

12:09.280 --> 12:13.920
answer to the class struggle was not a revolt by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie that would

12:13.920 --> 12:17.680
seize the means of production and make them community owned as Marx described it was the

12:17.680 --> 12:22.720
incorporation of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and the means of production into the state as the

12:22.720 --> 12:28.000
state was the ideal vessel for the community most importantly of all though none of this nonsense

12:28.000 --> 12:33.680
is liberal economics in fact this idea of incorporation which can rightfully be called

12:33.680 --> 12:39.280
fascist economics bears no relation to liberalism at all and is in fact nearly identical to what the

12:39.280 --> 12:46.000
breadtubers derisively call state capitalism the soviet union china cuba venezuela derisively

12:46.000 --> 12:51.680
even as they support them nonetheless this is why you hear such sayings as fascism is honest

12:51.680 --> 12:58.320
socialism even though that's not fully accurate it's more like fascism is post-marxist socialism

12:58.320 --> 13:03.040
here's the biggest kicker though these idiots don't actually believe that fascism is capitalism

13:03.040 --> 13:07.760
and decay if they did surely they'd be accelerationists right if centrism truly

13:07.760 --> 13:12.000
enabled fascism if liberalism inevitably decayed into fascism which inevitably collapsed into

13:12.000 --> 13:16.320
socialism if marx was right about it all and gentile was not wouldn't you want this process

13:16.320 --> 13:20.800
to continue at least the socialists of old had the good sense to be consistent and call social

13:20.800 --> 13:25.840
democracy social fascism for its part in helping the working class while preventing a revolution

13:25.840 --> 13:30.640
oh wait vash thinks that's true too there were a number of left-wing political parties which

13:30.640 --> 13:36.880
basically took their orders directly from the kremlin in the 1920s and 1930s which adopted the

13:36.880 --> 13:43.200
mantra of uh or at least the the idea that this thing exists this thing called social fascism

13:43.200 --> 13:48.800
and the argument was that fascism that that is one thing and then you have another thing and that

13:48.800 --> 13:59.520
other thing is social fascism and social fascism is everything that isn't fascism or or or socialism

13:59.520 --> 14:05.840
essentially uh social fascism so named because it procures the social conditions which lead to

14:05.840 --> 14:11.920
fascism and there is a crumb of truth in here as well take liberalism for example does liberalism

14:11.920 --> 14:19.280
lead to fascism well yeah and with that vosh clip we come to the apex of this discussion

14:19.280 --> 14:24.400
fascism is subversive but not because it's incoherent the idea that fascism has no guiding

14:24.400 --> 14:30.800
doctrine is itself a marxist subversion designed to hide the fact that fascism is a post marxist

14:30.800 --> 14:36.240
socialism and that fascism versus socialism marx versus gentile is not a battle between two ends of

14:36.240 --> 14:41.520
an ideological dipole but instead a civil war between two factions both aiming to inherit

14:41.520 --> 14:47.360
hagel's anti-liberal crown fascism is subversive because socialism is subversive and this shouldn't

14:47.360 --> 14:52.240
be a surprise to anybody we've all seen this subterfuge that's not real communism or not real

14:52.240 --> 14:57.440
socialism is heard all over the place not because it's a true statement it's always real socialism

14:57.440 --> 15:01.680
but because it never does what they want it to do so they don't count it but that's just surface

15:01.680 --> 15:07.280
level stuff consider how often that socialist environmentalists object to non-socialist

15:07.280 --> 15:12.240
environmental plans because those plans do not also implement socialism and dismantle capitalism

15:12.240 --> 15:17.440
while solving the climate crisis climate change is a problem about equity it's a problem about

15:17.440 --> 15:23.200
race it's a problem about how we relate to one another and so i think this climate crisis

15:23.200 --> 15:28.400
actually might provide us with an opportunity in a weird way consider the mass subversion of

15:28.400 --> 15:33.200
cultural institutions by people with explicitly marxist agendas under the guise of everything

15:33.200 --> 15:38.480
being political and neutrality being a bourgeois privilege in fact to the point that subversion

15:38.480 --> 15:43.760
is often literally a stated goal by the wokest of the woke consider the account of yuri besmenov

15:43.760 --> 15:48.880
a former kgb agent whose career revolved around a form of subversion the soviets called active

15:48.880 --> 15:53.760
measures where cultural and academic institutions would be infiltrated and seeded with marxism and

15:53.760 --> 15:58.080
consider this back at the start of this video vosch asserted that you cannot truly know who

15:58.080 --> 16:02.560
a fascist is because they'll never tell you you have to intuit it through things like his humor

16:02.560 --> 16:06.880
at this point in the video have you managed to figure out exactly what is wrong with vosh's view

16:06.880 --> 16:14.160
of things in 1921 fruccio geniglia an italian marxist was killed by one of mussolini's fascist

16:14.160 --> 16:19.520
black shirts by a gunshot to the head there was a public outcry against political violence within

16:19.520 --> 16:24.000
a liberal state where voting and debate should take the place of beatings and killings but the

16:24.000 --> 16:30.320
black shirts didn't care in 1922 giacomo madiati the leader of the italian unitary socialist party

16:30.320 --> 16:34.800
decried mussolini's election as fraudulent he was kidnapped by the black shirts thrown into the

16:34.800 --> 16:39.440
trunk of a car stabbed to death and dumped in the woods again there's a public outcry but the black

16:39.440 --> 16:44.560
shirts didn't care in july of 1925 giovanni amandola the leader of the italian democratic

16:44.560 --> 16:50.400
liberal party an outspoken critic of mussolini had the absolute shit beat out of him by 15 black

16:50.400 --> 16:55.920
shirts with clubs and suffered a long slow death over the next nine months mussolini did not play

16:55.920 --> 17:00.720
word games with these events he didn't dog whistle he didn't virtue signal he openly stated in

17:00.720 --> 17:05.120
parliament the black shirts were his that he wanted these men dead and that he did not care

17:05.120 --> 17:09.680
about what others thought about it and for his efforts mussolini was made dictator for life and

17:09.680 --> 17:14.800
the people for a time were bent to his will does this sound like a man who is lying who will never

17:14.800 --> 17:19.680
ever tell you that he is a fascist or does this sound like a man who is open and brazen about it

17:19.680 --> 17:24.560
and who is hoping that the average liberal or the politically online citizen will be desensitized to

17:24.560 --> 17:30.000
his violence someone like you because though subversion is a tool in the fascist handbook

17:30.000 --> 17:35.120
it's not a requirement the fascist doesn't even need to make you a fascist he just needs to get

17:35.120 --> 17:40.720
you to accept his violence as normal without protesting at some point in time vash has also

17:40.720 --> 17:45.120
stated that any socialist will simply tell you they're socialist that socialists are open and

17:45.120 --> 17:50.160
honest about their politics again i can't refine this clip but he says it often enough that i don't

17:50.160 --> 17:54.400
think he would object and yet you can find close to people who are absolutely socialists refusing

17:54.400 --> 17:58.720
to even countenance the question there's a point i really have to put you and and you'll be aware

17:58.720 --> 18:02.640
of this because there's been a lot of um of commentary about this in the british media about

18:02.640 --> 18:07.280
you you've been a member of the communist party for about 40 years now you're still a member

18:07.280 --> 18:12.080
and we know that that communism is basically statist we look at communist countries around

18:12.080 --> 18:16.800
the world and we see that they are tremendously top-down dominant and controlled societies that

18:16.800 --> 18:21.280
they that they rule over and i just wonder i'm putting this question on behalf of those who

18:21.280 --> 18:25.920
wonder about your politics if your politics actually informs your sense of control

18:25.920 --> 18:31.200
it's not just it's not just the medical argument but you have a kind of a political bent to want

18:31.200 --> 18:38.000
the state to tell people what to do i've come on your program as a scientist as to all people

18:38.000 --> 18:44.160
who come onto your program as scientists they come on to talk about the evidence relevant theories

18:44.160 --> 18:51.760
how we approach our scientific disciplines and you don't ask other scientists about politics so

18:51.760 --> 18:59.040
i'm very happy to speak about science which is what my job is um and to limit it to that

18:59.040 --> 19:03.600
so you're saying that your politics doesn't inform your opinion on this subject i'm saying

19:03.600 --> 19:09.280
that i agree to come on this program as a scientist and i'm very happy to talk to you

19:09.280 --> 19:14.400
about the issues that you're raising as a scientist you can even find clips of vosh

19:14.400 --> 19:19.360
describing how good it is to hide the fact that you're a socialist for tactical reasons

19:19.360 --> 19:24.000
uh if you want to come off like really cool when you're a socialist you can just say you're an

19:24.000 --> 19:28.960
internationalist and it means basically the same thing from a leftist perspective but people won't

19:28.960 --> 19:33.520
look at you like you just said you're a hillary clinton supporter uh basically if you're ever

19:33.520 --> 19:39.280
around shoe on head and you want to say that you support like cooperation uh amidst like economic

19:39.280 --> 19:44.320
political systems the world around okay you say you're an internationalist all right you say

19:44.320 --> 19:49.280
you're an internationalist and you'll be fine it's not just public figures there's also a specific

19:49.280 --> 19:55.760
type of boiling the frog in all socialist speech i've had this exact same conversation with like a

19:55.760 --> 20:00.320
dozen online crypto socialists now and the next time you see this you should try it too

20:00.320 --> 20:04.560
maybe you're talking to a libertarian socialist or a democratic socialist or maybe you're talking to

20:04.560 --> 20:08.400
somebody who outwardly identifies as a social democrat but they're advocating quite strongly

20:08.400 --> 20:12.960
for for one topic maybe it's universal health care maybe it's universal worker co-ops or blanket free

20:12.960 --> 20:17.520
college or something like that and inevitably if you ask them about what their politics looks like

20:17.520 --> 20:21.600
after they've implemented this thing they're talking about they'll almost always say something

20:21.600 --> 20:25.920
like well that's a good first step then you got to ask what's the second step what's the third

20:25.920 --> 20:31.360
step where's the point when you say okay here is good there's no reason to go any further than this

20:31.360 --> 20:35.680
this example on screen right now is one of many who advocate for something small and unassuming

20:35.680 --> 20:41.680
but his next steps are a stateless moneyless classless society making him not a sock dem or

20:41.680 --> 20:46.320
a socialist but a communist and in fact when i point this out in our conversation he suddenly

20:46.320 --> 20:50.800
becomes a lot less friendly your politics are not what you advocate for right now but what

20:50.800 --> 20:55.760
your ideal end state is after all of the right now's have been accomplished this is why for

20:55.760 --> 21:00.160
example when xuan head said i'm not a socialist because i like socialism but it's not feasible

21:00.160 --> 21:05.280
right now she's actually a socialist maybe it's just me and my sensibilities but hiding your power

21:05.280 --> 21:09.280
level like that seems subversive as fuck and speaking of hiding your power level vosh calls

21:09.280 --> 21:14.160
himself a market socialist basically they're still trading with money but your whole economy is worker

21:14.160 --> 21:19.200
co-ops but do you actually think he is a market socialist let's hear it from his own mouth in your

21:19.200 --> 21:24.880
mind is market socialism temporary or permanent oh temporary i just look okay so here's the issue

21:24.880 --> 21:36.320
okay are you ready for it okay let's say shit-topia goes socialist shit-topia is right here

21:37.680 --> 21:43.360
right there shit-topia goes socialist okay it's right there all right now here's the issue okay

21:43.360 --> 21:46.880
how do they go socialist well they take the traditional route so what they do

21:47.520 --> 21:52.560
is the workers have an uprising they seize control of the state then after seizing control

21:52.560 --> 21:57.360
of the state they kick out uh all foreign investors all foreign businesses they nationalize

21:57.360 --> 22:01.280
the industry in their country and they start producing everything for the people by the people

22:01.280 --> 22:08.800
okay congratulations we've done it now here's the issue with that all right shit-topia has made a

22:08.800 --> 22:16.240
critical error okay shit-topia is no longer a market society meaning that the goods which are

22:16.240 --> 22:21.440
produced within the borders of this country are not produced for the purpose of selling others

22:22.160 --> 22:30.240
now that's great in concept decommodification is good but here's the issue i'm going to uh

22:30.240 --> 22:35.920
paint in black every country that's going to trade with them now wait that's not going to trade with

22:35.920 --> 22:44.720
them okay the issue is that with the abolition of a market society you no longer have an ability

22:45.280 --> 22:51.040
to meaningfully trade with neighboring nations and if you can't do that not only does your country

22:51.040 --> 22:55.360
suffer because there's a lot of shit you can't produce just in your own country it also means

22:55.360 --> 23:00.080
every other country on earth has absolutely no reason to not just go in there and fucking

23:00.080 --> 23:05.760
annihilate you okay why the fuck if you're completely cut off from the markets of the world

23:05.760 --> 23:11.520
why the fuck would what incentive is there for any other country in the world to tolerate your

23:11.520 --> 23:17.040
existence from their perspective all the resources in your country are just locked off to the

23:17.040 --> 23:23.920
universe the reason why i like market socialism is because it means you can bide your time and

23:23.920 --> 23:30.640
wait for other countries to start popping up that are also worker controlled and once those countries

23:30.640 --> 23:36.800
start popping up you can form trade blocks which is pivotal because if you form trade blocks you

23:36.800 --> 23:42.480
gain the ability to trade with first world nations and in doing so you disincentivize

23:42.480 --> 23:47.200
military action against your countries the united states stands to lose a tremendous amount of

23:47.200 --> 23:51.840
wealth resources labor what have you from the collective trade block that you're invading as

23:51.840 --> 23:58.320
the u.s there is a benefit to remaining a market society now you only do this for long enough

23:59.280 --> 24:06.480
that it's necessary eventually if enough of the world ends up being socialist fuck socialist

24:07.360 --> 24:12.720
socialist once there are enough countries working together it's now possible for them to represent

24:12.720 --> 24:18.000
enough of an economic and military block that the rest of the countries in the world don't

24:18.000 --> 24:23.200
really have a way of meaningfully opposing them the real goal is to make capitalist countries

24:23.200 --> 24:28.960
dependent on market socialist countries in the end vosch is not actually a market socialist

24:28.960 --> 24:35.440
his ideal end state is literally talking about soviet style top-down command economies but only

24:35.440 --> 24:40.000
after market socialism has managed to subvert enough of the world that it becomes the dominant

24:40.000 --> 24:44.160
power block and then is able to impose its will on the rest of the planet whether they want it

24:44.160 --> 24:50.080
or not by the way vosh what country is currently implementing your exact plan anyway can you

24:50.080 --> 24:54.800
imagine by the way what would happen if america went to war with china and we didn't get any more

24:54.800 --> 24:59.440
chinese goods in this country this country would fucking collapse okay we don't need nukes to

24:59.440 --> 25:04.240
destroy america all we need to do is cut off uh trade from china all right we would this country

25:04.240 --> 25:09.680
would be fucking done everything we rely on bye-bye and whoever started that war is not

25:09.680 --> 25:15.920
getting re-elected next election okay if you are sufficiently economically powerful you're just not

25:15.920 --> 25:22.240
going the war is not going to happen because in democracies there is a threat that comes along

25:22.240 --> 25:30.160
with depriving your population of material comfort so the goal in market socialism is to preserve

25:30.160 --> 25:38.000
your relation to those economic transactions long enough that you can provide a sufficient

25:38.000 --> 25:42.800
deterrent against military action against you it also means you don't hurt your own population

25:42.800 --> 25:47.680
because whether you guys like it or not being a market economy is way the fuck more fruitful

25:47.680 --> 25:54.160
than being um a command economy right now in this era like factually the reason why vietnam's gdp

25:54.160 --> 25:59.680
rose was because of market reform isn't this what china is doing well china's not socialist so

26:00.960 --> 26:06.000
so it kind of defeats the purpose a little bit yeah so it turns out vashj's plan is literally

26:06.000 --> 26:11.840
the plan of deng zhao ping and he's too dishonest to admit it because socialism is always subversive

26:11.840 --> 26:17.440
and bread tube is never honest in this video i have described to you how fascism is a revolutionary

26:17.440 --> 26:22.560
philosophy seeking to remake and incorporate society and how liberals and conservatives

26:22.560 --> 26:27.680
not socialists are most likely to oppose it i have described to you how fascism is subversive

26:28.640 --> 26:32.640
sometimes by hiding their power levels but more often than not through desensitizing their

26:32.640 --> 26:37.040
opponents to political terror by constantly performing brazen acts of street violence

26:37.040 --> 26:41.840
i have described to you how fascism despises liberalism using its own institutions to destroy

26:41.840 --> 26:47.280
it from within i have described to you how fascism has a totalitarian ideology that must incorporate

26:47.280 --> 26:51.840
everything into its structures and violently destroy anything that cannot be incorporated

26:51.840 --> 26:56.160
and most importantly of all i have shown you how each of these points that apply to fascism

26:56.160 --> 27:00.960
apply to socialism in equal measure from their revolutionary ideals to their brazen

27:00.960 --> 27:06.160
political violence to their hatred of liberals and liberal institutions and to their totalizing

27:06.160 --> 27:10.880
nature we will dig into the political theory of marx and gentile the feuding brothers in a future

27:10.880 --> 27:16.080
video but for now remember this it's very easy to find a friendly socialist they're often young

27:16.080 --> 27:20.720
idealistic maybe a little dumb sometimes but almost always good-natured and looking to do

27:20.720 --> 27:25.040
what they think will make things better and even though they won't actually make things better

27:25.040 --> 27:29.360
don't blame them when all you read is marx how can you know any better but it's not so for their

27:29.360 --> 27:34.320
talking heads every point that every breadtuber makes about fascism can just as easily be applied

27:34.320 --> 27:38.720
to themselves their hatred of ideological difference their revolutionary rhetoric their

27:38.720 --> 27:43.360
lies and their bad faith their support of political violence as praxis just as on the other

27:43.360 --> 27:47.760
side of their mouth they decry political violence if done by their enemies and their constant

27:47.760 --> 27:53.760
overwhelming deafening refrain about how despite what our lion eyes see they totally seriously

27:53.760 --> 28:00.000
hate the tankies guys the reality is all forms of socialism from marxism to fascism to everything

28:00.000 --> 28:05.520
in between are all the moral equivalents of each other and as liberals our only option is to oppose

28:05.520 --> 28:10.880
them thank you for watching my friends if you enjoyed this video please feel free to share it
