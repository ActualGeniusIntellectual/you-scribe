1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
In Vosch's debate with Count Dankula over whether or not Dankula was a white supremacist the point

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,880
was made that talking about things like policy or opinions with a white supremacist was pointless

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,800
because they would just lie and so Vosch starting from the position that Dankula was a hidden white

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,920
supremacist a crypto supremacist if you will didn't actually want to ask relevant questions

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,640
but simply say shit like you told a racist joke therefore you're a racist

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
I made racist jokes in the past doesn't mean that I'm racist they're just jokes

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,880
right so I want to open up oh sorry I've got a way to sort of do that straight now you feel

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,640
that there's certain beliefs that obviously that white supremacists have correct uh well

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,680
yeah I mean they'd have to well why not ask me if I believe in those things oh sure yeah

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,400
the answer is because I think you guys lie because you're spineless cowards that's the main reason

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,200
this is something Vosch would repeat in his conversation with Lilith only now Dankula's

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,520
graduated from white supremacist to fascist do you people like Count Dankula for example

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,960
who like when he makes comments that like seem openly fash it's always like a joke and he can

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,160
walk it back but his audience loves those comments they're not joking they like it you know but but

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,840
he's joking wink well I I mean me personally I think he's a fascist or he's not ideologically

16
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,240
consistent enough to know that he is but from what I've seen that seems to be like the underlying

17
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,040
political message that he's pushed and hey I'm thrown in there as well I know short fat otaku

18
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880
does this to some extent as well and there are other prominent libertarians who I think kind of

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,280
play cover a lot you know I mean I'm not even conservative republican or a libertarian if you

20
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
watch enough of Vosch's content you see this sort of thing repeated over and over to the point that

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,560
he now believes that all conservatives all republicans all libertarians and pretty much

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,560
almost everybody who is to the right of him are fascists if you have a conservative family member

23
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,760
I'm sorry they're part of the problem if you a conservative friend I'm sorry they're part of the

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,520
problem and every conservative every republican is on the hook for this every last one of them

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,040
people will be treating maga material the exact same way we treat holocaust or world war II or

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,640
vermont or ss materials today at some point Vosch has also said something to the effect of

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,160
fascism isn't a coherent political ideology it's simply a naked power grab that adopts the rhetoric

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,080
of other philosophies as a means to an end while not actually implementing the goals of those

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,040
philosophies and no I don't have a clip for this one you can only watch so much brain rot at once

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,480
but his video about social fascism contains a bit that has a lot of the same spirit fascism is a

31
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,720
disease it's a creeping mold that spreads from person to person using ideas like nationalism

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,240
and racism as vectors and every once in a while you get a you want to call it a super spreader

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,240
like QAnon you get these wacky ideas and you can spread to many people very quickly but it always

34
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,080
requires a bad idea and it spreads Vosch's guiding thesis here is that fascism is subversive that

35
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,760
it's incoherent it has no real political philosophy so it lies about everything in its

36
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,000
attempt to overthrow liberal democracy and Vosch is correct but he's correct for the wrong reasons

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,240
consider the claim that fascism has no real canon it's not just Vosch this is a common belief among

38
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,760
socialists look online wherever this sort of discussion is happening you'll hear about

39
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,280
subversive fascists co-opting socialist language or how fascism is inherently contradictory some

40
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,840
of the socialists I've talked to on this channel have said that as well fascism is kind of like

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:41,840
very incoherent in its uh philosophy um a lot of it is like complete nonsense the problem is

42
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,160
it isn't really true but I can tell you at least one of the reasons why they think that

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,800
Wikipedia yeah I've had this passage quoted to me by commies more times than I can count

44
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,840
this is from Giovanni Gentile's Wikipedia page the philosopher of fascism with gentile and with

45
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,040
fascism the problem of the party existed by virtue of the fact that the fascist party arose

46
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,280
organically rather than from a tracked or pre-established sociopolitical doctrine

47
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,680
this complicated the matter for gentile as it left no consensus to any way of thinking among

48
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,960
the fascists but ironically this aspect was to gentile's view of how a state or party doctrine

49
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,000
should live out its existence with natural organic growth and dialectical opposition intact

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,640
a dialectical opposition they're referencing Hegel's thesis antithesis synthesis method

51
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,600
gentile like Marx was a neo-hagalian philosopher this objection seems to stem from the observation

52
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,080
as well as gentile's own acceptance of that observation that fascism arose organically

53
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,000
without a guiding philosophy rather than a philosophy first being written and then a

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,640
social movement following it a Marxist critique of fascism is that this lack of a philosophical

55
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,440
basis leads to a fundamental irrationality within fascist movements creating a vacuum that almost

56
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,920
inevitably boils down to raw power as justification for their existence and you have to admit there

57
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,720
is something to this view but again it's not the whole story socialists commonly regurgitate

58
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,880
their misreading of the wikipedia passage in order to win twitter debates but none of them

59
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,560
will actually read the whole article as being quoted presumably because none of them have a

60
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,560
login to j store i still do though to be honest i thought it would have been canceled by now i've

61
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
been at school for like eight years the truth is the reference text is literally called the

62
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,960
problem of the party in italian fascism published in the journal of contemporary history volume 9

63
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,920
number 2 april of 1984 by emilio gentile no relation to giovanni gentile by the way it's

64
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,080
a funny coincidence that italy's philosopher of fascism as a political movement as well as italy's

65
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,200
foremost scholar of fascism from historic context both happen to share the same family name but

66
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,680
emilio is a liberal and there really is no political or genetic connection in the article

67
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,760
gentile amelio gentile writes the fascist party was in no sense a homogenous organism not only

68
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,320
because the inevitable mutations which all parties are subject but also because within the structure

69
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,880
and functions of the party there were a number of clearly distinct attitudes and modes of operation

70
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,840
during its history the fascist party underwent a real metamorphosis which substantially modified

71
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,600
its original characteristics without however completely wiping up the typical features by

72
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,160
which its historical identity can be recognized in spite of the structural and functional changes

73
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,640
it would however be superficial to attribute these changes only to circumstance and premeditated

74
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,840
interventions class interests and power plays these changes in fact correspond to a logic

75
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,640
which we might define as specifically totalitarian consistent with the conception of mass politics

76
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,720
characteristic of fascism in other words while the socialists are correct in describing fascism

77
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,200
as growing organically and therefore that method might seem outwardly contradictory and therefore

78
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,840
subversive the socialists are entirely incorrect when they assert that nothing exists below the

79
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,480
surface of fascism no there is certainly a coherent logic it is certainly a thing that

80
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,520
can be concretely identified not simply a vague creeping rot as vosh described it and if these

81
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,760
brainlets ever actually did any reading they'd know that it's actually kind of incredible if

82
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,160
you point out that you've read meinkampf or mussolini's doctrine of fascism or alfredo

83
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,080
rocco's political doctrine of fascism every socialist will scream at you that you're a

84
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,480
crypto fascist if you reply with the obvious response that you're reading about fascism not

85
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,160
because you're a fascist but to learn about fascism the socialist will tell you not to

86
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,480
bother because fascist theory is inherently contradictory and fascists all lie about what

87
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,360
they believe oh also that large swaths of the population are fascist even when they're not

88
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,120
even if they're bad in some other non-fascist way fascism is authoritarianism and conservatism

89
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,480
mixed together that's what fascism is i don't need i don't need this

90
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,240
umberto eco's fucking fucking take on it these same people if you happen to have some

91
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,800
misconceptions about socialism or communism or anarchism they'll demand that you read marx or

92
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,440
kropotkin or proudhon and they will happily love bombingly direct you towards any sources you

93
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,040
require because unlike fascist theorists their guys aren't incoherent their guys wouldn't lie

94
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,680
yeah when somebody tells you to accept their propaganda unthinkingly but don't you dare read

95
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,800
that other guy's heretical works or else you're pure evil who's being the subversive now personally

96
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,520
i would just tell you to read everything read it with a critical eye but read it

97
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,040
nonetheless that being said what the socialists see as irrationality within fascism the fascists

98
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,080
describe themselves as pragmatism in rocco's political doctrine of fascism he states fascism

99
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,000
solves the eternal problem of economic freedom and of state interference considering both as

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,400
mere methods which may or may not be employed in accordance with the social needs of the moment

101
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,480
and that fascists differ fundamentally from the liberals the latter see in liberty a principle

102
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,800
the fascists accepted as a method by the liberals freedom is granted in the interest of the citizens

103
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,120
the fascists granted in the interest of society the point here isn't that fascism is contradictory

104
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,200
it's that fascism is a consequentialist ideology happy to use the methods of other political

105
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,400
ideologies if the end result is good for fascism of course considering that a lot of socialists are

106
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,560
die-hard consequentialists it's no wonder they prefer that you not read about this stuff there

107
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,960
are also other theorists and other books they prefer you not read about as well zeve sternhill

108
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,360
a polish born jew who survived the holocaust to become a historian and academic on the topic of

109
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,080
fascism was the first to recognize that fascism was socialist tactics wearing a nationalist

110
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,880
uniform sargon did a premium lotus eaters video on one of his history texts a video i bullied him

111
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,520
for months to make and if you have premium there it's worth a watch sternhill also identified

112
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,720
george sorrell or georges i i can't pronounce french names guys as the missing evolutionary

113
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,600
link between marxism and fascism sorrell was a syndicalist who after observing that the proletariat

114
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,560
did not actually rise up in revolt when called upon to fight the first world war declared marxism

115
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,200
a failure sorrell discovered that the proletariat is always the most reactionary force in any

116
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,240
society and considered marx to be incorrect about the revolutionary potential sorrell also correctly

117
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,640
recognized that the proletariat are often driven to act when they believe in a collective mythos

118
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,600
whether that be the state or the people or the religion sorrell spent much of his life advocating

119
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,040
for socialism achieved through his conception of national syndicalism and both mussolini and

120
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,680
lenin are considered equal successors to cerulean thought for doing what sorrell described as

121
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,640
the union of the national and the social something i have studied without ever developing the idea

122
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,440
sorrell's philosophy acting as the bridge between marxism and fascism is more extensively explored

123
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,480
in james misel's article a premature fascist published in the western political quarterly

124
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,440
volume 3 number one march 1950 and we will absolutely return to sorrell's philosophy in

125
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
a future video because there is some interesting stuff in there another common bit of nonsense is

126
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,360
that fascism is somehow capitalism in decay and that late stage capitalism is simply another step

127
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,960
along this inevitable march it should be pointed out that it's no surprise that a proud ethno

128
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,680
nationalist would endorse an economic system whose final form is fascism after all the dictatorial

129
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,360
regimes of franco mussolini and hitler all followed a set pattern an authoritarian

130
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,880
salvation of the capitalist system resulting in their oversight over its industries the issue

131
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,320
with this view is again a lack of knowledge on the part of the socialists if you were to actually

132
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,280
question a breadtuber about this and get a real answer rather than snark and toxicity they would

133
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,560
probably say either one of two things one that the word privatization was literally invented

134
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,160
to describe fascist economics and it wasn't or two they would pull out this mussolini quote

135
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,400
fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is a merger of state

136
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,080
and corporate power and this is where the breadtuber stops reading secure in their

137
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,560
knowledge that corporations are fascist and therefore they're bad but alas it is not so

138
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,000
simple here is how things read when you don't simply stop as soon as your preconceived biases

139
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,720
are confirmed the corporate state considers that private enterprise in the sphere of production

140
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,200
is the most effective and useful instrument in the interest of the nation in view of the fact that

141
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,400
private organization of production is a function of national concern the organizer of the enterprise

142
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,560
is responsible to the state for the direction given to production Giovanni Gentile's philosophy

143
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,760
contained multiple Hegelian innovations to the socialism of old he believed that publicness and

144
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,040
privateness would cease to exist within a fascist system synthesized into a state of incorporation

145
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,760
where everything all people and all property became organs of the state in line with Hegel's

146
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,880
view that the state is the highest embodiment of the divine idea on earth back in a premature

147
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,920
fascist miso states fascism while preserving the framework of capitalism and tolerating the

148
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,280
entrepreneurs and financiers as individuals was destroying their power as a class the fascist

149
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,920
answer to the class struggle was not a revolt by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie that would

150
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,680
seize the means of production and make them community owned as Marx described it was the

151
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,720
incorporation of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and the means of production into the state as the

152
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,000
state was the ideal vessel for the community most importantly of all though none of this nonsense

153
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,680
is liberal economics in fact this idea of incorporation which can rightfully be called

154
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,280
fascist economics bears no relation to liberalism at all and is in fact nearly identical to what the

155
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:46,000
breadtubers derisively call state capitalism the soviet union china cuba venezuela derisively

156
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,680
even as they support them nonetheless this is why you hear such sayings as fascism is honest

157
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,320
socialism even though that's not fully accurate it's more like fascism is post-marxist socialism

158
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,040
here's the biggest kicker though these idiots don't actually believe that fascism is capitalism

159
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,760
and decay if they did surely they'd be accelerationists right if centrism truly

160
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,000
enabled fascism if liberalism inevitably decayed into fascism which inevitably collapsed into

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,320
socialism if marx was right about it all and gentile was not wouldn't you want this process

162
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,800
to continue at least the socialists of old had the good sense to be consistent and call social

163
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,840
democracy social fascism for its part in helping the working class while preventing a revolution

164
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,640
oh wait vash thinks that's true too there were a number of left-wing political parties which

165
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:36,880
basically took their orders directly from the kremlin in the 1920s and 1930s which adopted the

166
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,200
mantra of uh or at least the the idea that this thing exists this thing called social fascism

167
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,800
and the argument was that fascism that that is one thing and then you have another thing and that

168
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:59,520
other thing is social fascism and social fascism is everything that isn't fascism or or or socialism

169
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:05,840
essentially uh social fascism so named because it procures the social conditions which lead to

170
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,920
fascism and there is a crumb of truth in here as well take liberalism for example does liberalism

171
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,280
lead to fascism well yeah and with that vosh clip we come to the apex of this discussion

172
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,400
fascism is subversive but not because it's incoherent the idea that fascism has no guiding

173
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:30,800
doctrine is itself a marxist subversion designed to hide the fact that fascism is a post marxist

174
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,240
socialism and that fascism versus socialism marx versus gentile is not a battle between two ends of

175
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,520
an ideological dipole but instead a civil war between two factions both aiming to inherit

176
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,360
hagel's anti-liberal crown fascism is subversive because socialism is subversive and this shouldn't

177
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,240
be a surprise to anybody we've all seen this subterfuge that's not real communism or not real

178
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,440
socialism is heard all over the place not because it's a true statement it's always real socialism

179
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,680
but because it never does what they want it to do so they don't count it but that's just surface

180
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,280
level stuff consider how often that socialist environmentalists object to non-socialist

181
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,240
environmental plans because those plans do not also implement socialism and dismantle capitalism

182
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,440
while solving the climate crisis climate change is a problem about equity it's a problem about

183
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,200
race it's a problem about how we relate to one another and so i think this climate crisis

184
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,400
actually might provide us with an opportunity in a weird way consider the mass subversion of

185
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,200
cultural institutions by people with explicitly marxist agendas under the guise of everything

186
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,480
being political and neutrality being a bourgeois privilege in fact to the point that subversion

187
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,760
is often literally a stated goal by the wokest of the woke consider the account of yuri besmenov

188
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,880
a former kgb agent whose career revolved around a form of subversion the soviets called active

189
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,760
measures where cultural and academic institutions would be infiltrated and seeded with marxism and

190
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,080
consider this back at the start of this video vosch asserted that you cannot truly know who

191
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,560
a fascist is because they'll never tell you you have to intuit it through things like his humor

192
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,880
at this point in the video have you managed to figure out exactly what is wrong with vosh's view

193
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:14,160
of things in 1921 fruccio geniglia an italian marxist was killed by one of mussolini's fascist

194
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,520
black shirts by a gunshot to the head there was a public outcry against political violence within

195
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,000
a liberal state where voting and debate should take the place of beatings and killings but the

196
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,320
black shirts didn't care in 1922 giacomo madiati the leader of the italian unitary socialist party

197
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,800
decried mussolini's election as fraudulent he was kidnapped by the black shirts thrown into the

198
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,440
trunk of a car stabbed to death and dumped in the woods again there's a public outcry but the black

199
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,560
shirts didn't care in july of 1925 giovanni amandola the leader of the italian democratic

200
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,400
liberal party an outspoken critic of mussolini had the absolute shit beat out of him by 15 black

201
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,920
shirts with clubs and suffered a long slow death over the next nine months mussolini did not play

202
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,720
word games with these events he didn't dog whistle he didn't virtue signal he openly stated in

203
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,120
parliament the black shirts were his that he wanted these men dead and that he did not care

204
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,680
about what others thought about it and for his efforts mussolini was made dictator for life and

205
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,800
the people for a time were bent to his will does this sound like a man who is lying who will never

206
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,680
ever tell you that he is a fascist or does this sound like a man who is open and brazen about it

207
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,560
and who is hoping that the average liberal or the politically online citizen will be desensitized to

208
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,000
his violence someone like you because though subversion is a tool in the fascist handbook

209
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,120
it's not a requirement the fascist doesn't even need to make you a fascist he just needs to get

210
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,720
you to accept his violence as normal without protesting at some point in time vash has also

211
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,120
stated that any socialist will simply tell you they're socialist that socialists are open and

212
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,160
honest about their politics again i can't refine this clip but he says it often enough that i don't

213
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,400
think he would object and yet you can find close to people who are absolutely socialists refusing

214
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,720
to even countenance the question there's a point i really have to put you and and you'll be aware

215
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,640
of this because there's been a lot of um of commentary about this in the british media about

216
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,280
you you've been a member of the communist party for about 40 years now you're still a member

217
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,080
and we know that that communism is basically statist we look at communist countries around

218
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,800
the world and we see that they are tremendously top-down dominant and controlled societies that

219
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,280
they that they rule over and i just wonder i'm putting this question on behalf of those who

220
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,920
wonder about your politics if your politics actually informs your sense of control

221
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,200
it's not just it's not just the medical argument but you have a kind of a political bent to want

222
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:38,000
the state to tell people what to do i've come on your program as a scientist as to all people

223
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,160
who come onto your program as scientists they come on to talk about the evidence relevant theories

224
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:51,760
how we approach our scientific disciplines and you don't ask other scientists about politics so

225
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:59,040
i'm very happy to speak about science which is what my job is um and to limit it to that

226
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,600
so you're saying that your politics doesn't inform your opinion on this subject i'm saying

227
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,280
that i agree to come on this program as a scientist and i'm very happy to talk to you

228
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,400
about the issues that you're raising as a scientist you can even find clips of vosh

229
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,360
describing how good it is to hide the fact that you're a socialist for tactical reasons

230
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,000
uh if you want to come off like really cool when you're a socialist you can just say you're an

231
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,960
internationalist and it means basically the same thing from a leftist perspective but people won't

232
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,520
look at you like you just said you're a hillary clinton supporter uh basically if you're ever

233
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,280
around shoe on head and you want to say that you support like cooperation uh amidst like economic

234
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,320
political systems the world around okay you say you're an internationalist all right you say

235
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,280
you're an internationalist and you'll be fine it's not just public figures there's also a specific

236
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,760
type of boiling the frog in all socialist speech i've had this exact same conversation with like a

237
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,320
dozen online crypto socialists now and the next time you see this you should try it too

238
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,560
maybe you're talking to a libertarian socialist or a democratic socialist or maybe you're talking to

239
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,400
somebody who outwardly identifies as a social democrat but they're advocating quite strongly

240
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,960
for for one topic maybe it's universal health care maybe it's universal worker co-ops or blanket free

241
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,520
college or something like that and inevitably if you ask them about what their politics looks like

242
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,600
after they've implemented this thing they're talking about they'll almost always say something

243
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,920
like well that's a good first step then you got to ask what's the second step what's the third

244
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,360
step where's the point when you say okay here is good there's no reason to go any further than this

245
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,680
this example on screen right now is one of many who advocate for something small and unassuming

246
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,680
but his next steps are a stateless moneyless classless society making him not a sock dem or

247
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,320
a socialist but a communist and in fact when i point this out in our conversation he suddenly

248
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,800
becomes a lot less friendly your politics are not what you advocate for right now but what

249
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,760
your ideal end state is after all of the right now's have been accomplished this is why for

250
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,160
example when xuan head said i'm not a socialist because i like socialism but it's not feasible

251
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,280
right now she's actually a socialist maybe it's just me and my sensibilities but hiding your power

252
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,280
level like that seems subversive as fuck and speaking of hiding your power level vosh calls

253
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,160
himself a market socialist basically they're still trading with money but your whole economy is worker

254
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,200
co-ops but do you actually think he is a market socialist let's hear it from his own mouth in your

255
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,880
mind is market socialism temporary or permanent oh temporary i just look okay so here's the issue

256
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:36,320
okay are you ready for it okay let's say shit-topia goes socialist shit-topia is right here

257
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,360
right there shit-topia goes socialist okay it's right there all right now here's the issue okay

258
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,880
how do they go socialist well they take the traditional route so what they do

259
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,560
is the workers have an uprising they seize control of the state then after seizing control

260
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,360
of the state they kick out uh all foreign investors all foreign businesses they nationalize

261
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,280
the industry in their country and they start producing everything for the people by the people

262
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:08,800
okay congratulations we've done it now here's the issue with that all right shit-topia has made a

263
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:16,240
critical error okay shit-topia is no longer a market society meaning that the goods which are

264
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,440
produced within the borders of this country are not produced for the purpose of selling others

265
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:30,240
now that's great in concept decommodification is good but here's the issue i'm going to uh

266
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,920
paint in black every country that's going to trade with them now wait that's not going to trade with

267
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:44,720
them okay the issue is that with the abolition of a market society you no longer have an ability

268
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,040
to meaningfully trade with neighboring nations and if you can't do that not only does your country

269
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,360
suffer because there's a lot of shit you can't produce just in your own country it also means

270
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,080
every other country on earth has absolutely no reason to not just go in there and fucking

271
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,760
annihilate you okay why the fuck if you're completely cut off from the markets of the world

272
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,520
why the fuck would what incentive is there for any other country in the world to tolerate your

273
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,040
existence from their perspective all the resources in your country are just locked off to the

274
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:23,920
universe the reason why i like market socialism is because it means you can bide your time and

275
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:30,640
wait for other countries to start popping up that are also worker controlled and once those countries

276
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,800
start popping up you can form trade blocks which is pivotal because if you form trade blocks you

277
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,480
gain the ability to trade with first world nations and in doing so you disincentivize

278
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,200
military action against your countries the united states stands to lose a tremendous amount of

279
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,840
wealth resources labor what have you from the collective trade block that you're invading as

280
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,320
the u.s there is a benefit to remaining a market society now you only do this for long enough

281
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:06,480
that it's necessary eventually if enough of the world ends up being socialist fuck socialist

282
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,720
socialist once there are enough countries working together it's now possible for them to represent

283
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,000
enough of an economic and military block that the rest of the countries in the world don't

284
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,200
really have a way of meaningfully opposing them the real goal is to make capitalist countries

285
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,960
dependent on market socialist countries in the end vosch is not actually a market socialist

286
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,440
his ideal end state is literally talking about soviet style top-down command economies but only

287
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,000
after market socialism has managed to subvert enough of the world that it becomes the dominant

288
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,160
power block and then is able to impose its will on the rest of the planet whether they want it

289
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:50,080
or not by the way vosh what country is currently implementing your exact plan anyway can you

290
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,800
imagine by the way what would happen if america went to war with china and we didn't get any more

291
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,440
chinese goods in this country this country would fucking collapse okay we don't need nukes to

292
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,240
destroy america all we need to do is cut off uh trade from china all right we would this country

293
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,680
would be fucking done everything we rely on bye-bye and whoever started that war is not

294
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:15,920
getting re-elected next election okay if you are sufficiently economically powerful you're just not

295
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:22,240
going the war is not going to happen because in democracies there is a threat that comes along

296
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,160
with depriving your population of material comfort so the goal in market socialism is to preserve

297
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:38,000
your relation to those economic transactions long enough that you can provide a sufficient

298
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,800
deterrent against military action against you it also means you don't hurt your own population

299
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,680
because whether you guys like it or not being a market economy is way the fuck more fruitful

300
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:54,160
than being um a command economy right now in this era like factually the reason why vietnam's gdp

301
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,680
rose was because of market reform isn't this what china is doing well china's not socialist so

302
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,000
so it kind of defeats the purpose a little bit yeah so it turns out vashj's plan is literally

303
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,840
the plan of deng zhao ping and he's too dishonest to admit it because socialism is always subversive

304
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,440
and bread tube is never honest in this video i have described to you how fascism is a revolutionary

305
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,560
philosophy seeking to remake and incorporate society and how liberals and conservatives

306
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,680
not socialists are most likely to oppose it i have described to you how fascism is subversive

307
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,640
sometimes by hiding their power levels but more often than not through desensitizing their

308
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,040
opponents to political terror by constantly performing brazen acts of street violence

309
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,840
i have described to you how fascism despises liberalism using its own institutions to destroy

310
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,280
it from within i have described to you how fascism has a totalitarian ideology that must incorporate

311
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,840
everything into its structures and violently destroy anything that cannot be incorporated

312
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,160
and most importantly of all i have shown you how each of these points that apply to fascism

313
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,960
apply to socialism in equal measure from their revolutionary ideals to their brazen

314
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,160
political violence to their hatred of liberals and liberal institutions and to their totalizing

315
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,880
nature we will dig into the political theory of marx and gentile the feuding brothers in a future

316
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,080
video but for now remember this it's very easy to find a friendly socialist they're often young

317
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,720
idealistic maybe a little dumb sometimes but almost always good-natured and looking to do

318
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,040
what they think will make things better and even though they won't actually make things better

319
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,360
don't blame them when all you read is marx how can you know any better but it's not so for their

320
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,320
talking heads every point that every breadtuber makes about fascism can just as easily be applied

321
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,720
to themselves their hatred of ideological difference their revolutionary rhetoric their

322
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,360
lies and their bad faith their support of political violence as praxis just as on the other

323
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,760
side of their mouth they decry political violence if done by their enemies and their constant

324
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,760
overwhelming deafening refrain about how despite what our lion eyes see they totally seriously

325
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,000
hate the tankies guys the reality is all forms of socialism from marxism to fascism to everything

326
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,520
in between are all the moral equivalents of each other and as liberals our only option is to oppose

327
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,880
