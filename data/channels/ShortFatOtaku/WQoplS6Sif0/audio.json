{"text": " Hey guys, we just got back from watching The Hobbit. So I thought we'd just do a run through. We got some AMW burgers and tea. Should we break them out while we talk? Yeah, you know, it's kind of tradition for us to Eat crappy food on camera. So anyways For those of you who don't really know me. I mean, if they didn't know you, why would they be here? That's true Anyways, okay, what I'm trying to get at is that I Have been a Owls over there. He's playing Red Faction. Thank God I can talk. I was gonna say you can dish while you dish. Excellent! Right anyways back on the topic. I have been an avid Lord of the Rings fan since I was about 15 Um These new burgers what for me is actually pretty good Let's review the burgers instead cuz they're pretty good. Well, I see there's like it's a burger with mayo and cheese and ketchup Okay, so when I was 15 My my mom tried to get me to read her copy of The Hobbit which I have right here As my mom's copy. It's missing the back cover Wonderful and it was um she actually purchased a copy of the Sommarillion, which if You don't know why the fuck would you ever read this? Sommarillion is the history book it's like the Bible of Middle Earth it has everything from the beginning or So they say Eru the one the alluvatar God whatever in halls I knew also known as well angels and they had this this This holy symphony and you know, there's more goth or Melkor was like if you haven't noticed Oh blah blah blah case. You haven't noticed Dave is the ultimate fucking Lord of the Rings nerd asshole I'm really not and I just I just I that's what I remember though and me I I don't really care one way either by the series So we're just kind of I'm the average guy and you're the ultimate fan blood. Oh, so you've been third? Yeah, I did notice You guys so you got two casuals and pretty much hard for It was pretty easy to say I mean again I fell asleep during it is there anything less than casual Apathetic. Oh, okay. So apathetic casual hardcore. We got three levels lethargic Anyways so I got pretty hardcore into Lord of the Rings from there I Watched all I was actually the movie I watch it. What do the movie? Well, I'm just giving a precursor Precursors like here's Dave's life regarding Tolkien how much whatever I love. I love Tolkien's work. I love the Hobbit I love Lord of the Rings. I mean, I've seen all the movies like a thousand times I own this dick at least three, you know, I you went back in time Wow, it must show me this I Loved the movie I thought was very well done. There are definitely some things that I wasn't as overjoyed about but Here's the thing they put elements of something called the unfinished tales into this movie and the unfinished tale is essentially just a collection of Exactly what it sounds like unfinished tales That Tolkien wrote during between 1914 and while basically up to his death and He never really got them published, but they are all Relevant to different ages in the Middle Earth universe and one of them is actually a tale of The the expedition to Erebor Told through Gandalf's eyes and he goes on a bit about this battle between the dwarves and the orcs at Moria and mentions I pretty damn sure he mentions a song and It was really cool to see all this stuff. That was so originally That hard that that that that big armless orc guy. Yeah, he wasn't in the Hobbit original. I Don't think so, I think he was there don't read a book right now to try and find Thinking he was Somewhere in there. Maybe but there's so many there's so many characters Yeah to remember that I mean Like there this is only the first movie of three and I'll be wrong. They're like halfway through it. Here's here's the thing This is this is the Hobbit book. Mm-hmm. This is about the same size One of the three books that make it the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Yep, that trilogy got three movies This book is getting three movies That it this this movie is about an hour too long. I think In our hours two hours too long So you want you want like a one hour? 50 minute movie. It's like it's like an HBO show Yeah It's Game of Thrones watch Game of Thrones. I do have to admit that there were parts that dragged on The beginning half-hour did think it takes a long time to get going. No, but that's the thing though I thought it was awesome because This is a general audience. You have to set up a history There has to be something established there and I thought the fact that they're showing Erebor is showing the Dwarven Kingdom They they show Dale they show everything, you know, they show the entire environment around there because They're not gonna get there until the second movie. Yeah, so they want to show you know It's not just it's not just a few scribbles on a map. It's a real place with you know, real real towns real people It's very beautiful. It's very stark I understand on that but I feel like they could have saved it until the beginning of the second movie to show us my That it's just not really relevant right now. We're just like and also I also mean like the stuff that's happening with Bilbo hanging out in his house and they got like all the kind of what's proto. Oh, no No, well partially that that went a little bit too long You just had you know Elijah would show up for like a five-second cameo in it Well, I thought it was and then he's always going they actually have Even a prologue a prologue to the prologue. Yeah In Lord of the Rings, it was really weird. I mean it's cool and it kind of like a slice of white Slice of life style Slice of white slice it your way Yeah, slice of lifestyle. I thought it was kind of cool They're just kind of padding it's like padding. Oh here here is my I think my biggest personal problem with this movie Mm-hmm. It was still an alright movie. I'd still definitely recommend people watch it, but They're taking They're going out of their way too much to try and link it back to the original three movies Yeah, like like Frodo shows up for like 20 minutes at the start of the movie and he kind of overstays as welcome then like later on it has Gandalf's hanging out with another wizard guy in the two elves. I saw him on and glad you're all yeah They're all just talking about like Well, that's the thing though There is some kind of council. There's something that goes on believe they actually talk about this necromancer Yeah, it's only mentioned in the books though. They don't go into detail Here's my movie the necromancer scene was basically just them trying to talk about you think hook it to the to the three Movies a little bit more and it has nothing to do with this story If you cut that scene out this movie would be the exact same. It would not lose anything Well, they have they should at least mention this the necromancer because they do in the book It's very really if everything that happens to Gandalf. He just explains it. He says oh I ran into Radagast And he told me about the necromancer and dull Golder. That's it Like they don't actually really show Radagast They don't go on about although I love the fact that he says the there's he says like there's the five wizards and he says the two was blue wizards like I don't remember their names because They don't they don't give the names like I think they give Elvish names or something that they don't give any human names to them Yeah, they have the original because the Wizards are actually my are they're all the spirits from the basically from heaven They're like miners. They're like minor spirits. I got there turned into old men and I know But I love it. Yeah, and they have a lot of in jokes that really really Hardcore fan that was kind of funny. How did you just like? Oh, yeah There's these these two blue guys, and I don't know I don't remember their name I like how the brown wizard was covered in shit. Yeah See you make the shit roll down Radagast. Yeah, Radagast was kind of a joke Don't get me wrong. And he had like a bobsled with like rabbits. Was that from the book too? No No No, it was not. I saw it with my mom. She loved that. Wait, where did Radagast go even? I don't even remember him leaving the movie What happened to him? I remember he was um, he was trying to bait the the war riders. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah Well, he's least well, yeah, he fucked off because he saw that they were So they were going after the others and he couldn't get their attention anymore. So I was like, oh shit I'm just gonna get the hell out of here. I guess let's go home and forget the quest. What an asshole Like he could fight He's a proud wizard. What's he gonna do play the brown note? weird It's said that Radagast becomes more and more animalistic as years go on. Yeah Yeah, I don't know if he I don't I don't think he ever actually Goes because on the end of the Lord of the Rings I actually like they go off to the West or whatever Right. I don't think it Radagast ever leaves middle I think he just becomes more and more wild as the years go on more and more crazy Cuz like Saruman even says that guy he eats too many mushrooms and they add all his brains and they make his teeth yellow It's like pretty obvious. What kind of mushrooms he's eating But no, it was a pretty good movie but my only my only real problems that they seem to shoehorn scenes in to try and link it back to the The Lord of the Rings trilogy movies that didn't really seem to belong there Like yeah, if you usually if you're making a movie out of a book you don't You don't like add things to the book you cut things from the book and I think the mention They did that Lord of the Rings too though, but like if they were going to Cut anything from this movie and make it not, you know an ass-numbing three hours of a movie The first thing to cut would be all the references to the original Get the necromancy stuff out of there because the movie wouldn't suffer for it The movie is about the you know, the 13 dwarves hanging out and then fighting but it's it's it's an overarching story though It's an overarching story connects the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings It's part of it's part of the overarching story of even just Middle Earth in general Sauron was the second command of like the of the devil. He is like the devil's right-hand man. He's bail He's Mephistopheles. He's whatever he's whatever Everything you're saying but in terms of this movie as A single day could have just a referenced him and that's it It didn't need to be they didn't have to didn't have to go to such detail about about the fucking Fortress then have to go in such detail about about this necromancer And show him they didn't have to you know, show the the witch kings dagger and all I mean, I don't remember that that that that doesn't work that that doesn't seem right to me And don't get me wrong. I mean, well, let's talk about the things we liked about it now. Oh I Mean the setting was the exact, you know, the setting for all the same was really nice to see the old settings from that they were using Lord of the Rings Rivendell and in the river Brunin and the trolls the trolls were awesome. Yeah, they're hilarious. Oh, man Okay, I actually wanted to lean over and whisper this to you India I Wanted to lean over a student theater context. Yeah, I wanted to lean over and whisper this student theater but it's like the scene kept going really quickly, so I just didn't but when when you see Galadriel for the first time and Like she's staying there. She's like that long long ass gala kind of flowers out onto the floor Yeah, and then like she rotates in place rather than just stepping she rotates in place You could turn I think and I could down like twists up her as she just turns out. It's like hey guys I was thinking she was on one of those Um, oh like a turntable those shitty ad machines like you sound like you just like move your hips and you swing back I was like that's the first thing comes in your mind There were a lot of Moments in this in this movie that were goofy and we're forgivable because it's a fantasy movie Well, because it's like it's a it's a children's book. Yeah, it's well it was marketed as a children's book Yeah, don't get me wrong. They made it a lot darker. Yeah a lot darker. I mean They even right from the beginning I mean We're showing up and I think they wanted to keep the same audience in the same Yeah to say the same tone as the original three movie, but they were all singing. They kept the singing in Yeah, that's kind of good. It wasn't. Oh, but it wasn't it wasn't like all Ponce here like that. It wasn't quite I know there. There are some ponds to like that first song where they're singing Yeah, well cracking the plates and all that. Yeah That's just a thing though, they they gotta keep stuff like that in because it it's part of what made It added that that or of whimsy to the original book Yeah, so I mean they took they took so much out of Lord of the Rings. That was that was whimsical There was a there was a lot of singing there was a lot of light hard Somewhat light harness to the elves themselves, but more in the Hobbit They are they're like they're actually a bunch of well trolls and I'm talking internet trolls Joking around with people they like fucking with people's minds. Oh, here's a fucking thing. What's the book? Sorry? Here's the thing. I remember the big thing about Lord of the Rings is how come Gandalf didn't get those fucking birds and like fly fly the fucking ring over and Everyone who says that everyone who replies that says well Gandalf didn't have the birds yet Yeah, and like by the time the end of the third fucking movie comes around he has the birds to use it's like, okay Fine in this movie. He uses the birds. No, the birds are there and this is before the first I could have sworn he uses that boss an asshole. Yeah. Yes. Um, it's up to the birds to decide but okay If he they just get dumped off like that It takes away all these all these events. I mean the whole point of these stories. It's not okay. It's a story Development at the same time In the context of the people living in that world. Why wouldn't they oh, I know I know I know under the context of the in the in-world process. It would make so much more sense just to get a lift I mean, what would you rather walk? We're gonna ride. So I've heard some people say that like Sirens tower there how they can have like a laser eye beam coming to the eye that would like shoot the Eagles maybe But I'm not sure if that's actually a thing. Well, yeah, why won't you knock it off? If that's the case then why wouldn't the I be shooting lasers at the army from from Gondor No, I think people are just being idiots I mean seriously laser I also know The the undead human kings there who had like those 13 other rings. Yeah, they had like they were riding dragons, right? They're right dragon that's cool. Yeah. Yeah. So like I guess they could like done like Air support type thing Against against the Eagles. I don't why wasn't it like an aerial battle in Lord of the Rings like Eagles vs. Dragons, man Or sure, they did attack them at the end. Yeah, it was like like a two-second scene Yeah, that should have been like the main focus of the entire fucking war was like the aerial battle This isn't World War one dog fights The whole point of this you've gotten away the fuck off track. Yeah, you're going on these tangents about about things that Okay. Yeah, I mean you're the English guy Here's here's the thing is that One thing that I mean it didn't ruin the movie for me But I did wonder this constantly throughout the movie is how come some of the dwarves? Had like the big beards the big noses the big hands and arms They had like the dwarven body and some of them were just like tiny humans. Yeah. Yeah Billy Kelly Thorin they just didn't put the makeup on those guys. I wonder why they didn't do that Are they actually they're actually different types of dwarf that are just like less nosy. No Well, there are I think there are different types of dwarves but these but these guys are all Arab war doors They're all they're all from the same place. Yes, but at the same time Maybe you just wanted some of the doors to look goofy and something to look serious I think there's like the guy there's the one guy who had just the beard not the the mustache He was like a younger guy with the like the ginger beard. I think they're trying to make him look younger and kind of dopey Philly and Kelly, you know Thorin's these are actually thorns cut first cousins. Yeah, that's why they're there They're so they're so tight with them. Yeah They are they are very young by dwarven standards that I and that's that's why they make them They're their beards are much shorter that sort of thing. Yeah, I'm Thorin I think they just wanted to give them more of a sense of nobility. I Feel like they just wanted to at least put a couple of hot toddies Yeah, pretty much good-looking male actors into the movie just they all weren't because Martin Freeman's kind of like just mr. Average I think they just they they just wanted to put in a couple of decent looking Human looking actors and have it the right instead of like having an entire cast like an old man And like a bunch of midgets with like big noses You know, they actually wanted to make someone look half half human creams machines old man That's some some midgets. Yeah Old man the midget source Well Yeah, I also I'm disappointed that We didn't get to the dragon this time That it's build up I know but like they but you can't spend a full movie on Bill I think if you build up for the first third of a movie they can't show them at all But they should have like they spend this entire time talking about the dragon as being the biggest threat and it doesn't show up Until the very end where it like blinks out of the gold pot. I was like, yeah As soon as I saw the dragon slowly it's a hook as soon as I saw the dragon slowly emerge from the pile of gold I was like this movie's ending on his eye Probably opening up into it It did yeah. Yeah, there was some predictability there. Yeah, it's it's unfortunate Why do dragons that go What's the deal with that? Uh, they're just wicked cruel greedy, but they can't spend it. They don't they don't care That's the whole thing it's like a crow they just grab shiny things a lot of ancient mythology, you know He's drawing ancient mythology, right? Why are you question? You know, I read way more Mythological because this he's a literature that I have so basically Because I like things to be explained Okay, okay here here's something that you may not have learned right by now is not everything spoon-fed You have to sometimes it takes learning things on your own I'm not doing homework to go to a fucking movie Or or or okay, sometimes just take things as I are Not question that shit out of them. No, no, that's what we do. That's what we do here on the site That's what I've been doing all this time, yep, okay No, it was it was a good movie I liked it I was uh, you know, they all all my nitpicks are just nitpicks and it was overall pretty good. No, I For the most part. I agree The actor plays Gandalf looks significantly older this time though, sir. You become yeah, he's ten years older. Yeah Yeah, that's one thing I didn't worry. He's supposed to be younger, but he looks older. Yeah Well, that is the thing. Yeah, that is a thing with it. Well, yeah That's one of those things that you just sometimes can't get around with all the makeup in the world don't necessarily get around it Yeah, it's just one of those things Especially if he's got any allergy to the makeup, you know, yeah, it's gonna screw him up And you think guys are old like I mean, he's got to be he's got to be about 80 by now But is he Christopher Lee's got to be older than that even Christopher Christopher Lee is like 88 I swear to God and he's like hand this movie to you for a little bit Yeah, I think I see is always only show up in the book too. Yeah, I think I'm pretty sure he did It's really was in the book. Yes, Chris Yes, Christopher Lee as Christopher Lee as the necromancer. He actually turns out to be Dracula to show up in the book. It's actually a hammer film You know, it's it's it's it's a it's a huge tribute to hammer films. They're just gonna have you know Gandalf be a a Vampire Slayer God What's wrong with me anyways For anyone who is a hardcore fan hasn't seen it. Why haven't you seen it yet? Why the hell happens? Like we had a good excuse We're we're in our home. Yeah, we're in our hometown for Christmas. Yeah, there's no theater there So you so guys they're useful. Yeah, it closed 17 years ago then it became a strip club then we came to strip club and now it is a Education center slash temp agency is it not and it's also like a Don't know. Oh, yeah. It's a cry dojo. Yeah, forget that. Yeah Anyways, yeah, so for hardcore fans definitely definitely a must-see There's a lot of things that I get thrown in there. I Probably didn't even recognize half of them because I mean it's been a while. I haven't read Unfinished Tales in like five years I Hadn't read the Hobbit in a few years either So there's all you know, this is one of those things one of the movies definitely I definitely recommend watching more than once just to catch it all def is this you just to catch all of the All these little things they add in it's it's amazing how much you want to see it already in 2d in 1d or? Or an avx because we only watch the 3d we didn't watch the avx one So I actually do want to see the avx one the hyper real version 3d wasn't really That good. No, it wasn't the 3d 3d was it was very lackluster. I thought that I mean, I don't I know I got I don't know if you guys do this But like sometimes during a 3d movie I like take off the glasses and see if there's any difference everyone There's there's barely any yeah, it's ridiculous. I mean during during like the Every single action set piece Yeah, there was always like there's like there's like rocks flying at the camera from like a sword impact in the ground And there was like a piece of wood flake. There's always stuff. Yeah You see you see some 3d there, but like rest of the movies just flat. Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty flat I mean if I was gonna watch this, I just watch some blu-ray when they watch TV or anything like that. I wouldn't bother it. I have a 3d TV. So that's easy. Well, I know exactly Just makes things easier for everyone Yeah, I really um, I wonder what the the extended edition of this movie is gonna be like 16 hours some of the dramatic pauses just I can't wait hours. This is the guy who watched like Every not only to watch all the extended editions But I watched I made sure every thing cuz I would get two thousand one thousand two 2003 they do have the extensions coming out and I'd sit there and I'd watch all the special features like back to back to back You're fucking loser. I was I was a nice kid. I had almost free time. I had nothing else to do So I was like fuck and I'm just gonna watch all the special feature stuff And then I saw there's this guy there who's like a elvish language expert and he's in more But he's like the geekiest guy I've ever seen my ladies. This guy is single Anyways, yeah, it's an alright movie I Is definitely more just alright, I feel like it is an average movie that most people will enjoy Um, but you know, we're gonna touch on something was major to like it's the Gollum scene Well, we're not too long to that. Yes, I agree I think went on too long what I really hope they would have done instead and I know it's because they've already established Gollum is a is a character because this is a prequel it's coming out after yeah after Lord of the Rings if they showed him less debilitated If they hadn't really shown him at all They've just shown him it look the only times that I really got the creeps was when they showed him up in the background And with his eyes shining like that because in the book in the book, they established Gollum very very well It's very very creepy. There's this vibe The way that we okay describes Gollum. He's just this little this slide questions in the book with the riddles. Yes Yes, they do that. I love I love the fact they kept that in they kept that the whole context in there Is it in the book? It's like they don't really show him. I mean, yes as a book the way it's described it, you know in the movie I would just barely show him. I just show the eyes. I wouldn't have him actually, you know grappling with them or anything like that um It just it felt like they're they're more or less just showcasing the technology like oh look what we can do now It's ten years later. He looks so much better. Yeah Yes, we're aware the technology is advanced that much you don't have to show it in the terms of just In just terms of build-up, it would have been all show up later In the rest of the book. No, so he won't be in like a movie two and three unless they just do something stupid Yeah, that's exactly it. He'll just show up the background. No, yeah. Hi guys. He doesn't this is this is it Like this is how he gets the ring Gollum he sees Gollum. He's about to you know, he's about to kill him or whatever and you know He feels sorry for him and you know what when I saw that that I actually got him up my throat When I'm gone, but like this the single tear and all that Um, he just looks so pitiful. He really does He looks like the saddest motherfucker of all time. Like he just lost his entire family because that's all he has This is like a Native American looking out at his wasteland of a country as like single to There's Just walking through the waters are eating and just eating McDonald's and throwing shit all over the reading a W and throwing No, no, he just he seemed he's just seems so pathetic and I felt I felt really bad for the character the kinship Well, he's he's an it's it's now a game ship Between you and him. Yeah, sure He's more like an act full of drug addicts This is exactly what it's supposed to be is he's addicted to the power that that the ring gives them and it's all he knows and Once he realizes it's gone from that. He may not ever get it back. He he's a you know, he becomes what? He really is just a crushed old hobbit That's all he is just an empty shell of a hobbit or whatever the hell he has like close to So from here on Bilbo just basically keeps the ring in his pocket He gets home and keeps in his trunk and then like yeah for like the next 60 years No ill effects despite like it just fucks up everybody else. Uh, what are you talking about? Well, no, there's no ill effects per se other than a game. He becomes addicted to it and it gave me a screamer face Yeah, and You know and kept him looking young of course he's very he looks basically the same the thing is like I can understand why they get a Younger guy to play him because I mean Ian home is he's no spring-chicken either. He's got to be about 70 by now I mean like all the shit that they make him. Oh, that's okay. Um They fall so far in this movie everyone falls like oh all the time It's true. They're in the this cave with all these goblins and shit and they fall like 500 feet and none of them are injured like maybe bruised But no eternal Henry like I don't see anyone spitting up blood. I don't see any broken bones I don't you know, I don't see any cuts any lacerations or was it? lacerations There's three of them lacerations evisceration eviscerations in Incineration. Yeah Yeah, there's there are none of those things when when they fall Well, I mean obviously like the incineration isn't relevant, but the other two they fall so fucking much Nobody ever gets like super injured just scrapes and bruises. It's like that that doesn't seem right. I know dwarves are hardy, but It doesn't seem very also like it must have happened at least three times in this movie where like Gandalf fucks off and Like in the moment, they've been like the party gets in trouble and get over. Yeah, that's how I did Yeah, that happens. I'm back guys. It just kills him That's how it happens in the book because in the book Gandalf is supposed to have an air of mystery to him He's an enigma You know, they make him seem a little bit more human in the movie They really do because they show what he does but in the book, it's just like he'll he'll come back, you know He'll shit. He'll save their ass and then he'll kind of give a somewhat vague answer or you know, like Maybe One or two occasions. He'll actually explain what he was doing, but that's it. It's just an explanation It's not actually showing him going to you know, they'll go there and blah blah blah Yeah, yeah You tried to end this thing now for like three three times and David, you know, I was like, oh I remember something else I know there's so there are so many things to discuss about it. Well, I mean, that's just like the movie itself They keep on trying to end it And Personally, I'm I'm not offended by it. I didn't at no point did I feel bored Actually, you know what? Technically this movie is not called The Hobbit. It's called an unexpected. Well, it's The Hobbit colon unexpected journey, but you didn't see the words The Hobbit weren't in the movie When you finally see the opening title card of the movie it just says an unexpected journey actually Yeah, they should have just said The Hobbit because it's in the Lord of the Rings. It started off Lord of the Rings And then you know Lord of the Rings and then Fellowship of the Rings but like Lord of the Rings I mean they started off a little because it's it's it's technically one book Yeah, yeah PJ you're Kind of you're kind of hit or miss everybody Fuck Oh Peter Jackson. Gotcha. It's you know what? I think it is losing all that weight He lost all the weight in his brain. No, I'm just fucking no no I Yeah, I really I really thought it was well done, you know, everything every movie has its warts So I you know, I'm not gonna give it like a numerical value like that because really yeah I don't see much point if you're if you don't like fantasy this won't convert you If you're not a big Lord of the Rings fan, but you just want to watch something just just to watch it This will entertain you for a while, but then you'll forget about it It's really only gonna be memorable to see you care in the first place. I Think and yet it's the highest grossing movie of the year. It's one of the highest It's possibly the highest grossing movie of all time. So I don't think you're on the button there, man I really don't because if it made that much money, that means people are going back from multiple viewings Multiple which means it must be good enough for a lot of people or that people are just becoming more more Fantasy, I think that's an ad. Yes For sure, but no if this is a movie that you don't like this won't change your mind But about me if you don't like fantasy, this isn't gonna make you love something about fantasy. This is not a gateway movie Yeah, oh god now if you actually want to get into fantasy I'd suggest watching the Brit Mmm Fuck yeah Yeah, it's a hands-on approach really really wet to all the ideas If you want to get into fantasy watch willow Oh My watch labyrinth. All right, we've got that's a wrong fantasy Oh That's the kind of fantasy if you want like, you know With his bulge with this bulge. Oh, yeah, cuz he reminds me of the babe So say what babe oh no That one's completely over my head and what babe the baby the power what power the power of voodoo who do you know? Okay. Anyways, whatever This has become completely irreverent completely irrelevant. Anyway Anyways, definitely two thumbs up for me Okay, that is a numerical thing. Yeah, it's two. Oh, no. I just ripped off Cisco neighbor Definitely definitely Very very high recommendation from me as a hardcore fan it it really does appeal This is this is not the fifth time you've said it's because it's true and to the casual person I still recommend it because it is a blockbuster. It does have a lot of you know great effects and incredible environments very You know wonderful music the score is is pretty much impeccable They tied a lot of Lord of the Rings themes in there because a lot of the characters No, but like some of the characters are still there. So they keep their themes and I thought it flowed very nicely So yeah overall it was it was very good Anyways, I look back in a bit and talk about the trailers that came before the movie Wow That is opposed to the ones after them. So the trailer is gonna be talking about the trailer. Yes Okay. Okay. We're back in a bit to actually talk about the trailers Okay, the trailers what shows you even get we got man of steel we got a Side red faction really fucked up. Yeah, I was just kind of Jumping humping the ground even though he was like buried in the ground. Okay, whatever Yeah, we got man of steel You got Will Smith's vehicle for his child, yeah after earth Yeah See Al gone I said I said welcome to earth to Daphne he didn't get it. I was like you fucking suck Yeah, yeah, I have to giant killer that's it and of course it is a good date a good day to die hard Yeah, I didn't get that wasn't there? No, no. Okay. Well, I saw it What else was there Star Trek? Oh, it's our truck. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's a lot of jumping off buildings Yeah, times a job, but I feel like a lot a lot of breaking the only thing I have to say about just trailers nowadays in general is Wow That's that is what every soundtrack for every trailer is now it's like It's yeah something and then cuts a black Wow It really is like they sample two seconds from a dubstep song I was like once the movie to start Gandalf would be like, yeah, there's that rat a guy's guy Actually if they just did they showed one one little blip of him that would be fucking creepy This old man in a brown just brown robes with shit all over his face He's looking like this when he knows there's like dark magic food he's like It was like the you know, the the dramatic chipmunk or direct school or whatever the hell it is. Yeah Yeah, like that shit all over space that's exactly what it looks like You got to poop on I gotta say I don't know you you really you really impressed with the die-hard one I I've only seen the first one so I can't really say. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I like I like yeah, I had movies They're pretty cool. They're the best Christmas movies Like this, you know, I like to say Bad Santa's one of the best ones yeah How many times is Alan Rickman fall out of a window in Bad Santa a lot Well, there's the deleted scenes But actually he goes he goes into the set of every Christmas movie ever made since Die Hard and he insists on being dropped out of the window Harry Marvin I think Oh Okay, yeah, so Die hard looked look like a good trailer, but I mean, you know Like you don't need a trailer for Die Hard. You know what it is. Yeah, it's Die Hard It's it's John McClane going out and getting shot at and falling and falling really far and apparently not dying Having a foot meter. Yes Wait, you'll get that one. No, you know diehard NES game. Oh fuck. Oh god Okay, that's why I probably stabbed some part of my brain after I saw that Partial lobotomy what else we had then Man of Steel came up that looks at that, you know, I'm excited I mean, I like there was no wow Yeah, there's no walk to it and you know I love this the setup him walking around in the Arctic. They don't show the fortress of solitude, but that's okay It's like I love the fact it's Kevin. It's Kevin Costner playing. It's playing. It's dad adopted dad Well, I don't know who plays his mom, but that's okay I mean, he's like sure the villain in the trailer if you noticed that yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah I don't I don't really know who it is. I don't recognize general Zod. Yeah, Neil before Zod Okay, nevermind it just it's I guess it's on I remember for the longest time the reason why they didn't want to Make make any more Superman movies after the sixth room Christopher Reeve Oh Had done his bit is because they couldn't find good villains to go up against Superman. You know, yeah Cuz I don't but Kevin Spacey Like with Batman you have the Joker. He has his Easy intent this is right there his his really famous arch-nemesis that always gives him a run for his money. Yeah With Superman, there's not really anybody like that Lex Luthor. Yeah, but he's not quite filmable Lex Luthor Brainiac Zod It's really just Zod. I do today in terms of In terms of making it work for a film it really is just general Zod Yeah, I guess It's good Now speculation About the Star Trek movie into darkness. Oh, we're done talking Superman. Well, there's not really much else to say You're gonna say Connor. Oh, here's what you're gonna say Todd. I I was like, I don't know. I don't even yeah No, no, no, it's calm You saw it. What if it's gone before we move on? Okay, um a good nice little loop that the Superman Trailer has created is that the first teaser trailer for Superman used the soundtrack from Lord of the Rings? When Gandalf died in the first movie you remember that? You guys they're right when you when you saw the Yeah, and they I saw the YouTube Collins and everyone's like you guys are seeing like from Lord of the Rings Walk. Yeah, just like Lord of the Rings stole the the theme from wrecking for a dream for the two towers trailer Yeah, that's true. That's kind of bizarre We'll see. I think I've been sorry, man. Just doing a double-end Anal Yeah, I Didn't actually know what record right? Like I knew a record Jim was I've heard of it But I'd never actually seen I didn't know that was the theme. So I thought it was badass if they had that in there Yeah Yeah Anyways, okay. So moving on Star Trek looks very promising That first is for wine. No, I don't you you Know I see in the theater. I said or what a lot of people think it's calm, but I don't think it's calm Okay. Okay. I didn't hear that There's a I don't think it is There's a character from the original series and you didn't hear this part because we're over using Something was psychic guy, right? There's a character from the original series and it was like a really a really well-made episode And it was this guy who was kind of introverted. He was like a circular officer. Mm-hmm He was a little bit introverted. He was kind of picked on he wasn't really treated that well by anybody But he was really smart And he had like Lee he had latent psychic powers that were brought out by some kind of Phenomenon that the the ship encountered you mean like John Travolta and phenomena Like He became basically all-powerful So he did change the world He was like wrecking the fucking ship and shit and like and then of course Kirk like beats the shit out of them because it's care But everyone is saying that the villain in this is this guy They're doing that story that's That makes sense. I mean, I'm not opposed to that though. We were like, I've never seen the original episode I'm actually tempted to go back and watch the original episode because there's a lot of Star Trek. I haven't seen more of a Star Wars guy So yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't be wrong. I mean I do like Star Trek to a degree I just haven't gotten into it as much so this should be educational for sure Really at the very least at the very least watching that one episode. Yeah We're just watching all a lot of people are saying on the internet that that that's also instead of it being conx He doesn't look like Connie's that he doesn't act like con. It's literally a regular, dude Yeah, and that's what this guy was. Well, he doesn't have the fake muscles, but it still could be him Ricardo Montalban You know, I don't know man Radley Con was a good fucking movie. I think he was kind of overrated to be honest Yeah, yeah same here. I really I really do. I I thought it was good, but I didn't think it was You know best movie ever good. I didn't think it was it wasn't even I don't even say it's my favorite of the entire series I have the Star Trek series. Yeah Favorite of all the first contact That was like that's kind of different cuz like now you're talking about next generation or generations I thought generations was very well done too. I don't agree with the first contact though. I didn't like generations at all. Really? Otherwise, I'd say see it for me. I didn't think the first one was that fantastic The original cast I think it's a toss-up between Wrath of Khan and the one with the whales And then I actually know maybe that one was my favorite for generation for next generation It's obviously going to be first. Yeah. Well, I need to be honest. I haven't even seen I mean ones after that I haven't seen insurrection or nemesis because I thought they looked stupid and they ended up being quite shit. Yeah in the last one Basically, they played war basically said yeah, we put like a dune buggy action scene in this cuz I like dune buggies He even said that like in the fucking interview for the movie Well, he did change his voice for that show. So I guess I had to give him that This is very distracting actually watching I'll play red facts in the background. What else what other chatter was that? Jacking the giant Slayer That looks like it That'd be like kind of thing. I'd bring my kid to if I had a kid. I don't have kids That seems like McDonald's toy pillar, yes, it feels like basically People are jumping on the Disney bandwagon like 20 years too late Yeah, and there's there's grabbing out every single old tale they can and trying to make an epic. Oh, yeah, because it's it's it's licensed right, yeah So there's like taking every old not even mythological There's a couple hundred years old story and you're just like let's make an epic fucking period piece out of this thing Yeah, let's let's like him go over his travels. We can't fuck that one at all Wait, are they actually others? They already made it man. It came out late 2005 or 2006 at Jack Black is Gulliver Where the fuck was I? Not watching it, obviously Netflix I watched it as Jason Segel doing possibly the worst English accent I've ever Mean like I could do a better English accent than that. He's like yours pretty good It Was it was fucking because go I love girls Travers go I love Gulliver's travel it is my of all classic literature I'd say it's my favorite book because It's just it's very it's very sarcastic tongue-in-cheek Just really really biting the satirical look on the society at the time and but it's got this whole fancy kind of element to it So if you haven't read it, I definitely recommend don't watch. Why are you recommending like a random book? No, you've related to Jack and the It gets in the literature anyway Nobody should make another travel movie ever again unless they know I'm decent. Yeah. Okay. Well Jack Yeah, Jack and the Beanstalk, of course, and apparently the guy played Hurley or you like voices a giant. I think I heard yeah I think I had heard that Jorge Garcia. I think he voices one of the one of the Giants in yeah Only good basically tell who it is to if it if it is him because he's got this massive fro Only point you actually see them in the trailer is him going Yeah, it might be good for a few laughs but I don't see it being it looks pretty vapid It's Isn't it vapid if you have kids it'll shut them up for like an hour then they'll get bored And then you'll never see the end. Yeah it looks like it's gonna end up being really similar to um, I Can see bombing like horribly the Red Riding Hood the Little Red Riding Hood. Yeah, I could hear you piece I mean, I could see that that was done destroying itself. Yeah Is that it? I feel there was fun. There is a Will Smith one. Oh Yeah, welcome to after earth. They're more Teaser trailer, right? So there's not much to say and Will Smith and his kid are Survivors of some kind of spaceship crash. You're right. I go with that at the very end of the trailer Will Smith It's like it's like this planet is And it's like well, yes It's earth obviously, I thought it was after earth For some reason all I could think of is after birth In after earth you can pick up after 8 instead of just a Christmas how you're thinking of this God Yeah, I don't I'm not attacking after birth I think it's kind of it's pretty funny how much How much? Jaden Smith looks like his old man now, but That's it. Was that kid who was within the same guy who did the karate kid? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I'm straight Well, the karate kid came out how many years ago? I Don't remember. It was 2008. I think so. Is that 2008 or 2009? Either way It's been at least two or three years since since he filmed so the kids grown up a lot So he looks like his old man. Anyways, uh, yeah, so all the lot I'd say the most I'd probably want to see Superman steel the most and for me it's Star Trek and Superman Yeah, Superman or just man of steel. Why is it Superman steel suddenly for us? It's man of steel. Yeah. Yeah, it's man of steel Yeah, I'd say man steel and then start right. I'd actually want to see Star Trek more. I like the last movie It was it was fantastic. It was really JJ Abrams Actually making something that made sense Wasn't just a bunch of loose ends. That was nice. Although that's also Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse too. I don't think Carlton Cuse did anything on the writing Well on lost. Yeah, but I mean it's the first Star Trek. Oh, well, no, I'm not talking about that I'm talking about lost. I think the first Star Trek was Damon Lindelof and JJ Abrams. Yeah, there was no Carlton Cuse involved Either way, it was it was tight made sense. That's the thing Okay. Anyways, that's that's it for trailer talk. Yeah. Yeah, I'm done. I'm totally done. Isn't there one more? You wrote something in your in your phone Oh warm body. Oh, yeah. Oh my god Okay, okay first off for anyone out there who hates Twilight You will hate this even more and I had never even heard of it until Devon. Devon even mentioned it That thing on your head Okay, so warm bodies is apparently the love story between a zombie and a human Zombie somehow sees this woman and his heart starts beating again and he regained some kind of some kind of consciousness some kind of Sense of morality. I don't know I get I'm guessing he still has the taste for human flesh and all that sort of thing because he'll always be haunted by his desire for You know for actually eating her She's gonna love that it's it's the stupidest looking movie yeah, it's Horrible, it's just absolutely atrocious. I only know I believe this shit will exist I can only hope that the riff tracks guys do a riff track. Oh, you know, they're going to so I can watch it Yeah, I'm not gonna watch it I've even finished watching the Twilight movies with riff tracks. I've been putting it off putting it off, but you know what? Yeah, I actually just watched them all of this before I before we went on brick Christmas break I just I basically I had like a bunch of work around the house to do Yeah, so I just put on my wireless headphones and I just listened to them for like Ten hours you listen to it. Just yeah, cuz I'm not gonna watch the fucking the going around those cleaning stuff Yeah, see that today like I'm thinking of actually sitting down and watching them Even though it doesn't make any sense I mean, I mean it doesn't make sense, but also make sense us to actually do what you're doing Yeah, that's actually a really good idea God Just filth. I mean They must know they're just like cashing in. Oh, yeah They have how could they not be cashing in? I mean, it's a love story between a supernatural creature and a human they were doing interviews on it Remember like the short little interview ets and like they're yeah, they're trying to talk about like with a straight face Yeah, they're actually that's the best acting Much better than the movie itself. Well, maybe the girl ended be in Better than and Bella's actress fuck. Yeah, she's pretty bland. I still can't believe she's gonna be an on the road She's basically the real-life Brock Yeah with warm bodies just Jesus Christ that yeah, yeah, I think that's pretty much it more bodies Jesus Christ You wanna go see are you saying that Jesus Christ is a zombie? Yes I'm gonna wait for it to come to the discount theater that way that we can go and we'll probably get the entire theater ourselves So we could sit there and like throw popcorn at the screen or like actually talk and actually talk Here's the thing if we can actually put theater to ourselves we could actually film ourselves Wow, that's not illegal. No film ourselves watching it and making fun of it. No actually filming the movie So stop by apathetic teenagers. I don't think they're gonna care Yeah, that's the great thing about the discount heater he wanted it's a discount Yeah, but also that because it's in like an area of town It's not quite as populated anymore. And you know that mall isn't quite get as much business Oh and like when when you actually would watch a movie there, it's usually pretty empty Yeah, I remember going there and just having like the entire place to yourself. Yeah I would see Ted and there was yeah, there was just there's a two of us of the just do how do they stay in business? Because some nights are better than others food Yeah on the food to always the food cheap. Oh god. Yeah. No, no, it's not cheap. Sorry to so bad It's like reasonable. It's not it's reader. Yeah, I mean, it's like half It's still highly half like Austin Silver City fuck or simplex or whatever and your your average movie theater. It's so That was like I don't go to movies that often So I find it really fucking ridiculous when I like I'm looking at the prices for food 12 bucks for a hot dog and nachos Oh my gosh, it was like fucking $8 Yeah, yeah, it's five bucks yeah, I got I bought a large and I ended up paying like 723 I think which sucks but at the same time there's a lot of food in a large bed Yeah, actually, that's that's pretty considerable. I mean, you'll get I think popcorn farts, but that's okay That's a risky take right high fiber content I eat high-fiber like normally though with with yeah, I know but it was like fake butter on it Yeah, that that's man horrible. Oh, man that big butter Like here's the thing at this theater You can like buy butter for like 20 cents or something to put on your popcorn, right? And then I said I didn't know you do or you do it for free because this stuff was like I didn't buy the butter But then they grape aside the interest of the theater. There is another station There's like a free there's like a free but I want you just do this and then and Dave's like wall because this better Try to I put it under and I press the button and what comes out is like apple juice. Yeah consistency of Incredibly melted butter. Yeah, it's like pure yellow waters like piss. Just that's basically yeah fucking essentially It's kind of tastes like it too. It just it didn't have a taste to it. It just basically moved up the popcorn Grease, it's extra grease on your popcorn. It's not even like your sock work wherever you want to insert it Just like pouring canola oil onto your popcorn essentially, yeah, that's our butter. It's kind of a little oil. Yeah Okay. Well, that's enough trailer talk. We've been getting incredibly off-base. So I'm gonna enter right here. Anyways, fuck I'm thanks for watching and I'm going what the fuck was that coming in your mouth? That was me saying have a good one What was the sound? What is that sound?
