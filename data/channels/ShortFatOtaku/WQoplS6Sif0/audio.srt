1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
Hey guys, we just got back from watching The Hobbit. So I thought we'd just do a run through. We got some

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,600
AMW burgers

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,360
and tea. Should we break them out while we talk? Yeah, you know, it's kind of tradition for us to

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,720
Eat crappy food on camera. So

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,720
anyways

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,320
For those of you who don't really know me. I mean, if they didn't know you, why would they be here? That's true

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,840
Anyways, okay, what I'm trying to get at is that I

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,960
Have been a

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,040
Owls over there. He's playing Red Faction. Thank God I can talk. I was gonna say you can dish while you dish. Excellent!

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,780
Right anyways back on the topic. I have been an avid Lord of the Rings fan since I was about 15

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,780
Um

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,620
These new burgers what for me is actually pretty good

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:04,940
Let's review the burgers instead cuz they're pretty good. Well, I see there's like it's a burger with mayo and cheese and ketchup

14
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,340
Okay, so when I was 15

15
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,400
My my mom tried to get me to read her copy of The Hobbit which I have right here

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,740
As my mom's copy. It's missing the back cover

17
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,740
Wonderful and it was um

18
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,820
she

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,700
actually purchased a copy of the Sommarillion, which if

20
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,900
You don't know why the fuck would you ever read this? Sommarillion is the history book

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
it's like the Bible of

22
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,380
Middle Earth it has everything from the beginning or

23
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,420
So they say Eru the one the alluvatar God whatever in halls

24
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,640
I knew also known as well angels and they had this this

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,600
This holy symphony and you know, there's more goth or Melkor was like if you haven't noticed

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,160
Oh blah blah blah case. You haven't noticed Dave is the ultimate fucking Lord of the Rings nerd asshole

27
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,440
I'm really not and I just I just I that's what I remember though and me

28
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,240
I I don't really care one way either by the series

29
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,320
So we're just kind of I'm the average guy and you're the ultimate fan blood. Oh, so you've been third? Yeah, I did notice

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,540
You guys so you got two casuals and pretty much hard for

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,560
It was pretty easy to say I mean again I fell asleep during it is there anything less than casual

32
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,260
Apathetic. Oh, okay. So apathetic casual hardcore. We got three levels lethargic

33
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
Anyways

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,400
so I got pretty hardcore into Lord of the Rings from there I

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,920
Watched all I was actually the movie I watch it. What do the movie?

36
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Well, I'm just giving a precursor

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,380
Precursors like here's Dave's life regarding Tolkien how much whatever I love. I love Tolkien's work. I love the Hobbit

38
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,360
I love Lord of the Rings. I mean, I've seen all the movies like a thousand times

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,560
I own this dick at least three, you know, I you went back in time

40
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,640
Wow, it must show me this

41
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,920
I

42
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,720
Loved the movie I thought was very well done. There are definitely some things that I

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,160
wasn't as

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,160
overjoyed about but

45
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
Here's the thing

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
they put elements of

47
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:28,480
something called the unfinished tales into this movie and the unfinished tale is essentially just a collection of

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Exactly what it sounds like unfinished tales

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,300
That Tolkien wrote during between 1914 and

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
while basically up to his death and

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,240
He never really got them published, but they are all

52
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,280
Relevant to different ages in the Middle Earth universe and one of them is actually a tale of

53
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,320
The the expedition to Erebor

54
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,240
Told through Gandalf's eyes and he goes on a bit about this battle

55
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,560
between the dwarves and the orcs at Moria and

56
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,240
mentions I pretty damn sure he mentions a song and

57
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,240
It was really cool to see all this stuff. That was so originally

58
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,600
That hard that that that that big armless orc guy. Yeah, he wasn't in the Hobbit original. I

59
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,840
Don't think so, I think he was there don't read a book right now to try and find

60
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,400
Thinking he was

61
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,640
Somewhere in there. Maybe but there's so many there's so many characters

62
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,320
Yeah to remember that I mean

63
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,880
Like there this is only the first movie of three and I'll be wrong. They're like halfway through it. Here's here's the thing

64
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,280
This is this is the Hobbit book. Mm-hmm. This is about the same size

65
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:56,220
One of the three books that make it the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Yep, that trilogy got three movies

66
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,300
This book is getting three movies

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,880
That it this this movie is about an hour too long. I think

68
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,240
In our hours two hours too long

69
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
So you want you want like a one hour?

70
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,520
50 minute movie. It's like it's like an HBO show

71
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
Yeah

72
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,160
It's Game of Thrones watch Game of Thrones. I do have to admit that there were parts that dragged on

73
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,160
The beginning half-hour did think it takes a long time to get going. No, but that's the thing though

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,160
I thought it was awesome because

75
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,320
This is a general audience. You have to set up a history

76
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,480
There has to be something established there and I thought the fact that they're showing Erebor is showing the Dwarven Kingdom

77
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,960
They they show Dale they show everything, you know, they show the entire environment around there because

78
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,800
They're not gonna get there until the second movie. Yeah, so they want to show you know

79
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,920
It's not just it's not just a few scribbles on a map. It's a real place with you know, real real towns real people

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,920
It's very beautiful. It's very stark

81
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,240
I understand on that but I feel like they could have saved it until the beginning of the second movie to show us my

82
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,760
That it's just not really relevant right now. We're just like and also I also mean like the stuff that's happening with

83
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,100
Bilbo hanging out in his house and they got like all the kind of what's proto. Oh, no

84
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,400
No, well partially that that went a little bit too long

85
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,240
You just had you know Elijah would show up for like a five-second cameo in it

86
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,920
Well, I thought it was and then he's always going they actually have

87
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,680
Even a prologue a prologue to the prologue. Yeah

88
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,040
In Lord of the Rings, it was really weird. I mean it's cool and it kind of like a slice of white

89
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Slice of life

90
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,200
style

91
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,300
Slice of white slice it your way

92
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,800
Yeah, slice of lifestyle. I thought it was kind of cool

93
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:00,200
They're just kind of padding it's like padding. Oh here here is my I think my biggest personal problem with this movie

94
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,120
Mm-hmm. It was still an alright movie. I'd still definitely recommend people watch it, but

95
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,760
They're taking

96
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,220
They're going out of their way too much to try and link it back to the original three movies

97
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,960
Yeah, like like Frodo shows up for like 20 minutes at the start of the movie and he kind of overstays as welcome

98
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
then like later on it has

99
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,680
Gandalf's hanging out with another wizard guy in the two elves. I saw him on and glad you're all yeah

100
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
They're all just talking about like

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Well, that's the thing though

102
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,200
There is some kind of council. There's something that goes on believe they actually talk about this necromancer

103
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,720
Yeah, it's only mentioned in the books though. They don't go into detail

104
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,540
Here's my movie the necromancer scene was basically just them trying to talk about you think hook it to the to the three

105
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,160
Movies a little bit more and it has nothing to do with this story

106
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,240
If you cut that scene out this movie would be the exact same. It would not lose anything

107
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,340
Well, they have they should at least mention this the necromancer because they do in the book

108
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:06,800
It's very really if everything that happens to Gandalf. He just explains it. He says oh I ran into Radagast

109
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,480
And he told me about the necromancer and dull Golder. That's it

110
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Like they don't actually really show Radagast

111
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,720
They don't go on about although

112
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,200
I love the fact that he says the there's he says like there's the five wizards and he says the two was blue wizards

113
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
like I don't remember their names because

114
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,720
They don't they don't give the names like I think they give

115
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,440
Elvish names or something that they don't give any human names to them

116
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,760
Yeah, they have the original because the Wizards are actually my are they're all the spirits from the basically from heaven

117
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,520
They're like miners. They're like minor spirits. I got there turned into old men and I know

118
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,420
But I love it. Yeah, and they have a lot of in jokes that really really

119
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,560
Hardcore fan that was kind of funny. How did you just like? Oh, yeah

120
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,080
There's these these two blue guys, and I don't know I don't remember their name

121
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,840
I like how the brown wizard was covered in shit. Yeah

122
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,880
See you make the shit roll down Radagast. Yeah, Radagast was kind of a joke

123
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:15,480
Don't get me wrong. And he had like a bobsled with like rabbits. Was that from the book too? No

124
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,200
No

125
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,560
No, it was not. I saw it with my mom. She loved that. Wait, where did Radagast go even? I don't even remember him leaving the movie

126
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,320
What happened to him? I remember he was um, he was trying to bait the the war riders. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah

127
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,060
Well, he's least well, yeah, he fucked off because he saw that they were

128
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,220
So they were going after the others and he couldn't get their attention anymore. So I was like, oh shit

129
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm just gonna get the hell out of here. I guess let's go home and forget the quest. What an asshole

130
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,600
Like he could fight

131
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,160
He's a proud wizard. What's he gonna do play the brown note?

132
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,880
weird

133
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,920
It's said that Radagast becomes more and more animalistic as years go on. Yeah

134
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,440
Yeah, I don't know if he I don't I don't think he ever actually

135
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,600
Goes because on the end of the Lord of the Rings I actually like they go off to the West or whatever

136
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,320
Right. I don't think it Radagast ever leaves middle

137
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,000
I think he just becomes more and more wild as the years go on more and more crazy

138
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,080
Cuz like Saruman even says that guy he eats too many mushrooms and they add all his brains and they make his teeth yellow

139
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,680
It's like pretty obvious. What kind of mushrooms he's eating

140
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,240
But no, it was a pretty good movie

141
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,120
but my only my only real problems that they seem to shoehorn scenes in to try and link it back to the

142
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,160
The Lord of the Rings trilogy movies that didn't really seem to belong there

143
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,320
Like yeah, if you usually if you're making a movie out of a book you don't

144
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,780
You don't like add things to the book you cut things from the book and I think the mention

145
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,720
They did that Lord of the Rings too though, but like if they were going to

146
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,720
Cut anything from this movie and make it not, you know an ass-numbing three hours of a movie

147
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,120
The first thing to cut would be all the references to the original

148
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,520
Get the necromancy stuff out of there because the movie wouldn't suffer for it

149
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:15,160
The movie is about the you know, the 13 dwarves hanging out and then fighting but it's it's it's an overarching story though

150
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,000
It's an overarching story connects the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings

151
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,160
It's part of it's part of the overarching story of even just Middle Earth in general

152
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:30,800
Sauron was the second command of like the of the devil. He is like the devil's right-hand man. He's bail

153
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
He's Mephistopheles. He's whatever he's whatever

154
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,400
Everything you're saying but in terms of this movie as

155
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,560
A single day could have just a referenced him and that's it

156
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,260
It didn't need to be they didn't have to didn't have to go to such detail about about the fucking

157
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,240
Fortress then have to go in such detail about about this necromancer

158
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,880
And show him they didn't have to you know, show the the witch kings dagger and all

159
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,400
I mean, I don't remember that that that that doesn't work that that doesn't seem right to me

160
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,640
And don't get me wrong. I mean, well, let's talk about the things we liked about it now. Oh

161
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,120
I

162
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,560
Mean the setting was the exact, you know, the setting for all the same was really nice to see the old

163
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,960
settings from that they were using Lord of the Rings

164
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:27,200
Rivendell and in the river Brunin and the trolls the trolls were awesome. Yeah, they're hilarious. Oh, man

165
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,160
Okay, I actually wanted to lean over and whisper this to you

166
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
India I

167
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,560
Wanted to lean over a student theater context. Yeah, I wanted to lean over and whisper this student theater

168
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:45,520
but it's like the scene kept going really quickly, so I just didn't but when when you see Galadriel for the first time and

169
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Like she's staying there. She's like that long long ass gala kind of flowers out onto the floor

170
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,440
Yeah, and then like she rotates in place rather than just stepping she rotates in place

171
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,380
You could turn I think and I could down like twists up her as she just turns out. It's like hey guys

172
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,520
I was thinking she was on one of those

173
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,180
Um, oh like a turntable those shitty ad machines like you sound like you just like move your hips and you swing back

174
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,060
I was like that's the first thing comes in your mind

175
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
There were a lot of

176
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,120
Moments in this in this movie that were goofy and we're forgivable because it's a fantasy movie

177
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,220
Well, because it's like it's a it's a children's book. Yeah, it's well it was marketed as a children's book

178
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,640
Yeah, don't get me wrong. They made it a lot darker. Yeah a lot darker. I mean

179
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,840
They even right from the beginning I mean

180
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,440
We're showing up and I think they wanted to keep the same audience in the same

181
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,460
Yeah to say the same tone as the original three movie, but they were all singing. They kept the singing in

182
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,680
Yeah, that's kind of good. It wasn't. Oh, but it wasn't it wasn't like all

183
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,920
Ponce here like that. It wasn't quite I know there. There are some ponds to like that first song where they're singing

184
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,140
Yeah, well cracking the plates and all that. Yeah

185
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,540
That's just a thing though, they they gotta keep stuff like that in because it it's part of what made

186
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,340
It added that that or of whimsy to the original book

187
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:19,620
Yeah, so I mean they took they took so much out of Lord of the Rings. That was that was whimsical

188
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,020
There was a there was a lot of singing there was a lot of

189
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,860
light hard

190
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,380
Somewhat light harness to the elves themselves, but more in the Hobbit

191
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,220
They are they're like they're actually a bunch of well trolls and I'm talking internet trolls

192
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,120
Joking around with people they like fucking with people's minds. Oh, here's a fucking thing. What's the book? Sorry?

193
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,460
Here's the thing. I remember the

194
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:50,740
big thing about Lord of the Rings is how come Gandalf didn't get those fucking birds and like fly fly the fucking ring over and

195
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,540
Everyone who says that everyone who replies that says well Gandalf didn't have the birds yet

196
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,620
Yeah, and like by the time the end of the third fucking movie comes around he has the birds to use it's like, okay

197
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,240
Fine in this movie. He uses the birds. No, the birds are there and this is before the first

198
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:11,900
I could have sworn he uses that boss an asshole. Yeah. Yes. Um, it's up to the birds to decide but okay

199
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,760
If he they just get dumped off like that

200
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:21,900
It takes away all these all these events. I mean the whole point of these stories. It's not okay. It's a story

201
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,740
Development at the same time

202
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:30,100
In the context of the people living in that world. Why wouldn't they oh, I know I know

203
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:36,900
I know under the context of the in the in-world process. It would make so much more sense just to get a lift

204
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
I mean, what would you rather walk?

205
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,560
We're gonna ride. So I've heard some people say that like

206
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,020
Sirens tower there how they can have like a laser eye beam coming to the eye that would like shoot the Eagles maybe

207
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,660
But I'm not sure if that's actually a thing. Well, yeah, why won't you knock it off?

208
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,660
If that's the case then why wouldn't the I be shooting lasers at the army from from Gondor

209
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,900
No, I think people are just being idiots I mean seriously laser I also know

210
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:14,620
The the undead human kings there who had like those 13 other rings. Yeah, they had like they were riding dragons, right?

211
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,380
They're right dragon that's cool. Yeah. Yeah. So like I guess they could like done like

212
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,100
Air support type thing

213
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:27,900
Against against the Eagles. I don't why wasn't it like an aerial battle in Lord of the Rings like Eagles vs. Dragons, man

214
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:33,900
Or sure, they did attack them at the end. Yeah, it was like like a two-second scene

215
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,840
Yeah, that should have been like the main focus of the entire fucking war was like the aerial battle

216
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,340
This isn't World War one

217
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,540
dog fights

218
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:50,380
The whole point of this you've gotten away the fuck off track. Yeah, you're going on these tangents about about things that

219
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,720
Okay. Yeah, I mean you're the English guy

220
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,620
Here's here's the thing is that

221
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,660
One thing that I mean it didn't ruin the movie for me

222
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,620
But I did wonder this constantly throughout the movie is how come some of the dwarves?

223
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,460
Had like the big beards the big noses the big hands and arms

224
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,180
They had like the dwarven body and some of them were just like tiny humans. Yeah. Yeah

225
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,700
Billy Kelly Thorin they just didn't put the makeup on those guys. I wonder why they didn't do that

226
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,140
Are they actually they're actually different types of dwarf that are just like less nosy. No

227
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,680
Well, there are I think there are different types of dwarves but these but these guys are all Arab war doors

228
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,560
They're all they're all from the same place. Yes, but at the same time

229
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,400
Maybe you just wanted some of the doors to look goofy and something to look serious

230
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,920
I think there's like the guy there's the one guy who had just the beard not the the mustache

231
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:53,580
He was like a younger guy with the like the ginger beard. I think they're trying to make him look younger and kind of dopey

232
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,260
Philly and Kelly, you know Thorin's these are actually thorns cut first cousins. Yeah, that's why they're there

233
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,400
They're so they're so tight with them. Yeah

234
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,280
They are they are very young by dwarven standards that I and that's that's why they make them

235
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,080
They're their beards are much shorter that sort of thing. Yeah, I'm Thorin

236
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,680
I think they just wanted to give them more of a sense of nobility. I

237
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,640
Feel like they just wanted to at least put a couple of hot toddies

238
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,000
Yeah, pretty much good-looking male actors into the movie just they all weren't because Martin Freeman's kind of like just mr. Average

239
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,360
I think they just they they just wanted to put in a couple of decent looking

240
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,240
Human looking actors and have it the right instead of like having an entire cast like an old man

241
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,440
And like a bunch of midgets with like big noses

242
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:46,200
You know, they actually wanted to make someone look half half human creams machines old man

243
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
That's some some midgets. Yeah

244
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Old man the midget source

245
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,520
Well

246
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,840
Yeah, I also I'm disappointed that

247
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
We didn't get to the dragon this time

248
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,480
That it's build up

249
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,840
I know but like they but you can't spend a full movie on Bill

250
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,200
I think if you build up for the first third of a movie they can't show them at all

251
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,520
But they should have like they spend this entire time talking about the dragon as being the biggest threat and it doesn't show up

252
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,120
Until the very end where it like blinks out of the gold pot. I was like, yeah

253
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,160
As soon as I saw the dragon slowly it's a hook as soon as I saw the dragon slowly emerge from the pile of gold

254
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,880
I was like this movie's ending on his eye

255
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,440
Probably opening up into it

256
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,120
It did yeah. Yeah, there was some predictability there. Yeah, it's it's unfortunate

257
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Why do dragons that go

258
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,720
What's the deal with that? Uh, they're just wicked cruel greedy, but they can't spend it. They don't they don't care

259
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,560
That's the whole thing it's like a crow they just grab shiny things a lot of ancient mythology, you know

260
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,560
He's drawing ancient mythology, right?

261
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,160
Why are you question? You know, I read way more

262
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,520
Mythological because this he's a literature that I have so basically

263
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Because I like things to be explained

264
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:17,480
Okay, okay here here's something that you may not have learned right by now is not everything spoon-fed

265
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,880
You have to sometimes it takes learning things on your own

266
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,360
I'm not doing homework to go to a fucking movie

267
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,440
Or or or okay, sometimes just take things as I are

268
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,240
Not question that shit out of them. No, no, that's what we do. That's what we do here on the site

269
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,800
That's what I've been doing all this time, yep, okay

270
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,600
No, it was it was a good movie I liked it

271
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,080
I was uh, you know, they all all my nitpicks are just nitpicks and it was overall pretty good. No, I

272
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
For the most part. I agree

273
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,240
The actor plays Gandalf looks significantly older this time though, sir. You become yeah, he's ten years older. Yeah

274
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,080
Yeah, that's one thing I didn't worry. He's supposed to be younger, but he looks older. Yeah

275
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,920
Well, that is the thing. Yeah, that is a thing with it. Well, yeah

276
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:16,000
That's one of those things that you just sometimes can't get around with all the makeup in the world don't necessarily get around it

277
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yeah, it's just one of those things

278
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,120
Especially if he's got any allergy to the makeup, you know, yeah, it's gonna screw him up

279
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,480
And you think guys are old like I mean, he's got to be he's got to be about 80 by now

280
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,440
But is he Christopher Lee's got to be older than that even Christopher Christopher Lee is like 88

281
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,240
I swear to God and he's like hand this movie to you for a little bit

282
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,000
Yeah, I think I see is always only show up in the book too. Yeah, I think I'm pretty sure he did

283
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,160
It's really was in the book. Yes, Chris

284
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
Yes, Christopher Lee as

285
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,680
Christopher Lee as the necromancer. He actually turns out to be Dracula to show up in the book. It's actually a hammer film

286
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,040
You know, it's it's it's it's a it's a huge tribute to hammer films. They're just gonna have you know

287
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,560
Gandalf be a a

288
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
Vampire Slayer

289
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
God

290
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,200
What's wrong with me

291
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,760
anyways

292
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:18,360
For anyone who is a hardcore fan hasn't seen it. Why haven't you seen it yet? Why the hell happens?

293
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,360
Like we had a good excuse

294
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,720
We're we're in our home. Yeah, we're in our hometown for Christmas. Yeah, there's no theater there

295
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,720
So you so guys they're useful. Yeah, it closed 17 years ago then it became a strip club

296
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
then we came to strip club and now it is a

297
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:39,400
Education center slash temp agency is it not and it's also like a

298
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,840
Don't know. Oh, yeah. It's a cry dojo. Yeah, forget that. Yeah

299
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,560
Anyways, yeah, so for hardcore fans definitely definitely a must-see

300
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,200
There's a lot of things that I get thrown in there. I

301
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,480
Probably didn't even recognize half of them because I mean it's been a while. I haven't read Unfinished Tales in like five years

302
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,080
I

303
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
Hadn't read the Hobbit in a few years either

304
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,080
So there's all you know, this is one of those things one of the movies definitely

305
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:15,000
I definitely recommend watching more than once just to catch it all def is this you just to catch all of the

306
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,360
All these little things they add in it's it's amazing how much you want to see it already in 2d in 1d or?

307
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:26,160
Or an avx because we only watch the 3d we didn't watch the avx one

308
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,640
So I actually do want to see the avx one the hyper real version

309
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
3d wasn't really

310
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,680
That good. No, it wasn't the 3d 3d was it was very lackluster. I thought that I mean, I don't I know

311
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,360
I got I don't know if you guys do this

312
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,080
But like sometimes during a 3d movie I like take off the glasses and see if there's any difference everyone

313
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,080
There's there's barely any yeah, it's ridiculous. I mean during during like the

314
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,840
Every single action set piece

315
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,280
Yeah, there was always like there's like there's like rocks flying at the camera from like a sword impact in the ground

316
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,960
And there was like a piece of wood flake. There's always stuff. Yeah

317
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,040
You see you see some 3d there, but like rest of the movies just flat. Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty flat

318
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,060
I mean if I was gonna watch this, I just watch some blu-ray when they watch

319
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,400
TV or anything like that. I wouldn't bother it. I have a 3d TV. So that's easy. Well, I know exactly

320
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Just makes things easier for everyone

321
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,020
Yeah, I really um, I wonder what the the extended edition of this movie is gonna be like

322
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:37,360
16 hours some of the dramatic pauses just I can't wait hours. This is the guy who watched like

323
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,960
Every not only to watch all the extended editions

324
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,380
But I watched I made sure every thing cuz I would get two thousand one thousand two

325
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:50,440
2003 they do have the extensions coming out and I'd sit there and I'd watch all the special features like back to back to back

326
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,420
You're fucking loser. I was I was a nice kid. I had almost free time. I had nothing else to do

327
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,720
So I was like fuck and I'm just gonna watch all the special feature stuff

328
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,200
And then I saw there's this guy there who's like a elvish language expert and he's in more

329
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,400
But he's like the geekiest guy I've ever seen my ladies. This guy is single

330
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,280
Anyways, yeah, it's an alright movie

331
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,080
I

332
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,200
Is definitely more just alright, I feel like it is an average movie that most people will enjoy

333
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,120
Um, but you know, we're gonna touch on something was major to like it's the Gollum scene

334
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,800
Well, we're not too long to that. Yes, I agree

335
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,800
I think went on too long what I really hope they would have done instead and I know it's because they've already established

336
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:43,780
Gollum is a is a character because this is a prequel it's coming out after yeah after Lord of the Rings if they showed him

337
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,180
less debilitated

338
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,260
If they hadn't really shown him at all

339
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:52,080
They've just shown him it look the only times that I really got the creeps was when they showed him up in the background

340
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:58,740
And with his eyes shining like that because in the book in the book, they established Gollum very very well

341
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,200
It's very very creepy. There's this vibe

342
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:08,420
The way that we okay describes Gollum. He's just this little this slide questions in the book with the riddles. Yes

343
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,220
Yes, they do that. I love I love the fact they kept that in they kept that the whole context in there

344
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,180
Is it in the book?

345
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:21,700
It's like they don't really show him. I mean, yes as a book the way it's described it, you know in the movie

346
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:27,300
I would just barely show him. I just show the eyes. I wouldn't have him actually, you know grappling with them or anything like that

347
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,660
um

348
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:37,020
It just it felt like they're they're more or less just showcasing the technology like oh look what we can do now

349
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,160
It's ten years later. He looks so much better. Yeah

350
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,360
Yes, we're aware the technology is advanced that much you don't have to show it in the terms of just

351
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,760
In just terms of build-up, it would have been all show up later

352
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,560
In the rest of the book. No, so he won't be in like a movie two and three unless they just do something stupid

353
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,600
Yeah, that's exactly it. He'll just show up the background. No, yeah. Hi guys. He doesn't this is this is it

354
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Like this is how he gets the ring

355
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,640
Gollum he sees Gollum. He's about to you know, he's about to kill him or whatever and you know

356
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,000
He feels sorry for him and you know what when I saw that that I actually got him up my throat

357
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,300
When I'm gone, but like this the single tear and all that

358
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,480
Um, he just looks so pitiful. He really does

359
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,240
He looks like the saddest motherfucker of all time. Like he just lost his entire family because that's all he has

360
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,600
This is like a Native American looking out at his wasteland of a country

361
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
as like single to

362
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,520
There's

363
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:47,360
Just walking through the waters are eating and just eating McDonald's and throwing shit all over the reading a W and throwing

364
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,040
No, no, he just he seemed he's just seems so pathetic and I felt I felt really bad for the character the kinship

365
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,260
Well, he's he's an it's it's now a game ship

366
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Between you and him. Yeah, sure

367
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,680
He's more like an act full of drug addicts

368
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:14,000
This is exactly what it's supposed to be is he's addicted to the power that that the ring gives them

369
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
and it's all he knows and

370
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:24,000
Once he realizes it's gone from that. He may not ever get it back. He he's a you know, he becomes what?

371
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,160
He really is just a crushed old hobbit

372
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,320
That's all he is just an empty shell of a hobbit or whatever the hell he has like close to

373
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,920
So from here on Bilbo just basically keeps the ring in his pocket

374
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,120
He gets home and keeps in his trunk and then like yeah for like the next 60 years

375
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,600
No ill effects despite like it just fucks up everybody else. Uh, what are you talking about?

376
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:50,680
Well, no, there's no ill effects per se other than a game. He becomes addicted to it and it gave me a screamer face

377
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Yeah, and

378
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,320
You know and kept him looking young of course

379
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,480
he's very he looks basically the same the thing is like I can understand why they get a

380
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,000
Younger guy to play him because I mean Ian home is he's no spring-chicken either. He's got to be about 70 by now

381
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,120
I mean like all the shit that they make him. Oh, that's okay. Um

382
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,000
They fall so far in this movie everyone falls like oh all the time

383
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,080
It's true. They're in the this cave with all these goblins and shit and they fall like

384
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,640
500 feet and none of them are injured like maybe bruised

385
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,240
But no eternal Henry like I don't see anyone spitting up blood. I don't see any broken bones

386
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,600
I don't you know, I don't see any cuts any lacerations or was it?

387
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
lacerations

388
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,560
There's three of them lacerations evisceration eviscerations in

389
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,440
Incineration. Yeah

390
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,800
Yeah, there's there are none of those things when when they fall

391
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,900
Well, I mean obviously like the incineration isn't relevant, but the other two they fall so fucking much

392
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:06,880
Nobody ever gets like super injured just scrapes and bruises. It's like that that doesn't seem right. I know dwarves are hardy, but

393
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
It doesn't seem very also

394
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,200
like it must have happened at least three times in this movie where like Gandalf fucks off and

395
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,760
Like in the moment, they've been like the party gets in trouble and get over. Yeah, that's how I did

396
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,920
Yeah, that happens. I'm back guys. It just kills him

397
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,700
That's how it happens in the book because in the book Gandalf is supposed to have an air of mystery to him

398
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,320
He's an enigma

399
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,520
You know, they make him seem a little bit more human in the movie

400
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,440
They really do because they show what he does but in the book, it's just like he'll he'll come back, you know

401
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,880
He'll shit. He'll save their ass and then he'll kind of give a somewhat vague answer or you know, like

402
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,520
Maybe

403
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,800
One or two occasions. He'll actually explain what he was doing, but that's it. It's just an explanation

404
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,300
It's not actually showing him going to you know, they'll go there and blah blah blah

405
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Yeah, yeah

406
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,720
You tried to end this thing now for like three three times and David, you know, I was like, oh I remember something else

407
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,840
I know there's so there are so many things to discuss about it. Well, I mean, that's just like the movie itself

408
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
They keep on trying to end it

409
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,400
And

410
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,720
Personally, I'm I'm not offended by it. I didn't at no point did I feel bored

411
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,760
Actually, you know what? Technically this movie is not called The Hobbit. It's called an unexpected. Well, it's The Hobbit

412
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,720
colon unexpected journey, but you didn't see the words The Hobbit weren't in the movie

413
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,440
When you finally see the opening title card of the movie it just says an unexpected journey actually

414
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,920
Yeah, they should have just said The Hobbit because it's in the Lord of the Rings. It started off Lord of the Rings

415
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,760
And then you know Lord of the Rings and then Fellowship of the Rings but like Lord of the Rings

416
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,840
I mean they started off a little because it's it's it's technically one book

417
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Yeah, yeah

418
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,680
PJ you're

419
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Kind of you're kind of hit or miss everybody

420
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Fuck Oh Peter Jackson. Gotcha. It's you know what? I think it is losing all that weight

421
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:10,400
He lost all the weight in his brain. No, I'm just fucking no no I

422
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,760
Yeah, I really I really thought it was well done, you know, everything every movie has its warts

423
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,280
So I you know, I'm not gonna give it like a numerical value like that because really yeah

424
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,680
I don't see much point if you're if you don't like fantasy this won't convert you

425
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,680
If you're not a big Lord of the Rings fan, but you just want to watch something just just to watch it

426
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,000
This will entertain you for a while, but then you'll forget about it

427
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,920
It's really only gonna be memorable to see you care in the first place. I

428
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,680
Think and yet it's the highest grossing movie of the year. It's one of the highest

429
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:49,120
It's possibly the highest grossing movie of all time. So I don't think you're on the button there, man

430
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,880
I really don't because if it made that much money, that means people are going back from multiple viewings

431
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,020
Multiple which means it must be good enough for a lot of people or that people are just becoming more more

432
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,660
Fantasy, I think that's an ad. Yes

433
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,060
For sure, but no if this is a movie that you don't like this won't change your mind

434
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:16,860
But about me if you don't like fantasy, this isn't gonna make you love something about fantasy. This is not a gateway movie

435
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:27,720
Yeah, oh god now if you actually want to get into fantasy I'd suggest watching the Brit

436
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Mmm

437
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Fuck yeah

438
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,120
Yeah, it's a hands-on approach really really wet to all the ideas

439
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,080
If you want to get into fantasy watch willow

440
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh

441
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,680
My watch labyrinth. All right, we've got that's a wrong fantasy

442
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Oh

443
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
That's the kind of fantasy if you want like, you know

444
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,880
With his bulge with this bulge. Oh, yeah, cuz he reminds me of the babe

445
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
So say what babe oh no

446
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,880
That one's completely over my head and what babe the baby the power what power the power of voodoo who do you know?

447
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,560
Okay. Anyways, whatever

448
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,680
This has become completely irreverent completely irrelevant. Anyway

449
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,120
Anyways, definitely two thumbs up for me

450
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,500
Okay, that is a numerical thing. Yeah, it's two. Oh, no. I just ripped off Cisco neighbor

451
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,560
Definitely definitely

452
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,960
Very very high recommendation from me as a hardcore fan it it really does appeal

453
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,720
This is this is not the fifth time you've said it's because it's true and to the casual person

454
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,480
I still recommend it because it is a blockbuster. It does have a lot of

455
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,440
you know great effects and

456
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
incredible environments

457
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,960
very

458
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,920
You know wonderful music the score is is pretty much impeccable

459
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,200
They tied a lot of Lord of the Rings themes in there because a lot of the characters

460
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:10,400
No, but like some of the characters are still there. So they keep their themes and I thought it flowed very nicely

461
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,320
So yeah overall it was it was very good

462
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,820
Anyways, I look back in a bit and talk about the trailers that came before the movie

463
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,760
Wow

464
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,920
That is opposed to the ones after them. So the trailer is gonna be talking about the trailer. Yes

465
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,980
Okay. Okay. We're back in a bit to actually talk about the trailers

466
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,280
Okay, the trailers what shows you even get we got man of steel we got

467
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,720
a

468
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,360
Side red faction really fucked up. Yeah, I was just kind of

469
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,360
Jumping humping the ground even though he was like buried in the ground. Okay, whatever

470
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,320
Yeah, we got man of steel

471
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,080
You got Will Smith's vehicle for his child, yeah after earth

472
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
Yeah

473
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,380
See Al gone I said I said welcome to earth to Daphne he didn't get it. I was like you fucking suck

474
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:25,640
Yeah, yeah, I have to giant killer that's it and of course it is a good date a good day to die hard

475
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,800
Yeah, I didn't get that wasn't there? No, no. Okay. Well, I saw it

476
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:36,040
What else was there Star Trek? Oh, it's our truck. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's a lot of jumping off buildings

477
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:41,720
Yeah, times a job, but I feel like a lot a lot of breaking the only thing I have to say about just trailers nowadays

478
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
in general is

479
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
Wow

480
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:53,160
That's that is what every soundtrack for every trailer is now it's like

481
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,840
It's yeah something and then cuts a black

482
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Wow

483
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,760
It really is like they sample two seconds from a dubstep song

484
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,040
I was like once the movie to start Gandalf would be like, yeah, there's that rat a guy's guy

485
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:25,120
Actually if they just did they showed one one little blip of him that would be fucking creepy

486
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,400
This old man in a brown just brown robes with shit all over his face

487
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,560
He's looking like this when he knows there's like dark magic food he's like

488
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,880
It was like the you know, the the dramatic chipmunk or direct school or whatever the hell it is. Yeah

489
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,000
Yeah, like that shit all over space that's exactly what it looks like

490
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,080
You got to poop on I gotta say

491
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,520
I don't know you you really you really impressed with the die-hard one

492
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,340
I I've only seen the first one so I can't really say. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I like I like yeah, I had movies

493
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,520
They're pretty cool. They're the best Christmas movies

494
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,800
Like this, you know, I like to say Bad Santa's one of the best ones yeah

495
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,160
How many times is Alan Rickman fall out of a window in Bad Santa

496
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
a lot

497
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,280
Well, there's the deleted scenes

498
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,760
But actually he goes he goes into the set of every Christmas movie ever made since Die Hard and he insists on being dropped

499
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760
out of the window

500
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Harry Marvin

501
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
I think

502
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Oh

503
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,640
Okay, yeah, so

504
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,840
Die hard looked look like a good trailer, but I mean, you know

505
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,000
Like you don't need a trailer for Die Hard. You know what it is. Yeah, it's Die Hard

506
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,760
It's it's John McClane going out and getting shot at and falling and falling really far and apparently not dying

507
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Having a foot meter. Yes

508
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,280
Wait, you'll get that one. No, you know diehard NES game. Oh fuck. Oh god

509
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,960
Okay, that's why I probably stabbed some part of my brain after I saw that

510
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:33,200
Partial lobotomy what else we had then Man of Steel came up that looks at that, you know, I'm excited

511
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,960
I mean, I like there was no wow

512
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,040
Yeah, there's no walk to it and you know

513
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,040
I love this the setup him walking around in the Arctic. They don't show the fortress of solitude, but that's okay

514
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:52,640
It's like I love the fact it's Kevin. It's Kevin Costner playing. It's playing. It's dad adopted dad

515
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,920
Well, I don't know who plays his mom, but that's okay

516
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:02,400
I mean, he's like sure the villain in the trailer if you noticed that yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah

517
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,760
I don't I don't really know who it is. I don't recognize general Zod. Yeah, Neil before Zod

518
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:15,440
Okay, nevermind it just it's I guess it's on I remember for the longest time the reason why they didn't want to

519
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,240
Make make any more Superman movies after

520
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,120
the sixth room Christopher Reeve Oh

521
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,880
Had done his bit is because they couldn't find good villains to go up against Superman. You know, yeah

522
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,280
Cuz I don't but Kevin Spacey

523
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,080
Like with Batman you have the Joker. He has his

524
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:42,280
Easy intent this is right there his his really famous arch-nemesis that always gives him a run for his money. Yeah

525
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:50,440
With Superman, there's not really anybody like that Lex Luthor. Yeah, but he's not quite filmable Lex Luthor

526
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,560
Brainiac Zod

527
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,360
It's really just Zod. I do today in terms of

528
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,080
In terms of making it work for a film it really is just general Zod

529
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
Yeah, I guess

530
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,360
It's good

531
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Now speculation

532
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:17,560
About the Star Trek movie into darkness. Oh, we're done talking Superman. Well, there's not really much else to say

533
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:24,040
You're gonna say Connor. Oh, here's what you're gonna say Todd. I I was like, I don't know. I don't even yeah

534
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,440
No, no, no, it's calm

535
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,600
You saw it. What if it's gone before we move on?

536
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:36,000
Okay, um a good nice little loop that the Superman

537
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:43,320
Trailer has created is that the first teaser trailer for Superman used the soundtrack from Lord of the Rings?

538
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,200
When Gandalf died in the first movie you remember that?

539
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,720
You guys they're right when you when you saw the

540
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,840
Yeah, and they I saw the YouTube Collins and everyone's like you guys are seeing like from Lord of the Rings

541
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,400
Walk. Yeah, just like Lord of the Rings stole the the theme from wrecking for a dream for the two towers trailer

542
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Yeah, that's true. That's kind of bizarre

543
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,600
We'll see. I think I've been sorry, man. Just doing a double-end

544
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,320
Anal

545
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,960
Yeah, I

546
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,160
Didn't actually know what record right? Like I knew a record Jim was I've heard of it

547
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,120
But I'd never actually seen I didn't know that was the theme. So I thought it was badass if they had that in there

548
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,240
Yeah

549
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,880
Yeah

550
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,620
Anyways, okay. So moving on Star Trek looks very promising

551
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,560
That first is for wine. No, I don't you you

552
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:50,120
Know I see in the theater. I said or what a lot of people think it's calm, but I don't think it's calm

553
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,120
Okay. Okay. I didn't hear that

554
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,240
There's a I don't think it is

555
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,280
There's a character from the original series and you didn't hear this part because we're over using

556
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,200
Something was psychic guy, right?

557
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,160
There's a character from the original series and it was like a really a really well-made episode

558
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,960
And it was this guy who was kind of introverted. He was like a circular officer. Mm-hmm

559
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,080
He was a little bit introverted. He was kind of picked on he wasn't really treated that well by anybody

560
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,720
But he was really smart

561
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:19,000
And he had like Lee he had latent psychic powers that were brought out by some kind of

562
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,720
Phenomenon that the the ship encountered you mean like John Travolta and phenomena

563
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Like

564
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,760
He became

565
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
basically all-powerful

566
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,760
So he did change the world

567
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,160
He was like wrecking the fucking ship and shit and like and then of course Kirk like beats the shit out of them because it's care

568
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,800
But everyone is saying that the villain in this is this guy

569
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,960
They're doing that story that's

570
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,240
That makes sense. I mean, I'm not opposed to that though. We were like, I've never seen the original episode

571
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,880
I'm actually tempted to go back and watch the original episode because there's a lot of Star Trek. I haven't seen more of a Star Wars guy

572
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,380
So yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't be wrong. I mean I do like Star Trek to a degree

573
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,480
I just haven't gotten into it as much so this should be educational for sure

574
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,360
Really at the very least at the very least watching that one episode. Yeah

575
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:17,320
We're just watching all a lot of people are saying on the internet that that that's also instead of it being conx

576
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,560
He doesn't look like Connie's that he doesn't act like con. It's literally a regular, dude

577
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,480
Yeah, and that's what this guy was. Well, he doesn't have the fake muscles, but it still could be him

578
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,120
Ricardo Montalban

579
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,600
You know, I don't know man Radley Con was a good fucking movie. I think he was kind of overrated to be honest

580
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,740
Yeah, yeah same here. I really I really do. I I thought it was good, but I didn't think it was

581
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,040
You know best movie ever good. I didn't think it was it wasn't even I don't even say it's my favorite of the entire series

582
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,040
I have the Star Trek series. Yeah

583
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Favorite of all the

584
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,720
first contact

585
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,520
That was like that's kind of different cuz like now you're talking about next generation or generations

586
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,740
I thought generations was very well done too. I don't agree with the first contact though. I didn't like generations at all. Really?

587
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:11,220
Otherwise, I'd say see it for me. I didn't think the first one was that fantastic

588
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,880
The original cast I think it's a toss-up between Wrath of Khan and the one with the whales

589
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,220
And then I actually know maybe that one was my favorite for generation for next generation

590
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:31,460
It's obviously going to be first. Yeah. Well, I need to be honest. I haven't even seen I mean ones after that

591
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:39,060
I haven't seen insurrection or nemesis because I thought they looked stupid and they ended up being quite shit. Yeah in the last one

592
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,140
Basically, they played war basically said yeah, we put like a dune buggy action scene in this cuz I like dune buggies

593
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,540
He even said that like in the fucking interview for the movie

594
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,540
Well, he did change his voice for that show. So I guess I had to give him that

595
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:03,140
This is very distracting actually watching I'll play red facts in the background. What else what other chatter was that?

596
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Jacking the giant Slayer

597
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,300
That looks like it

598
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,980
That'd be like kind of thing. I'd bring my kid to if I had a kid. I don't have kids

599
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,100
That seems like McDonald's toy pillar, yes, it feels like basically

600
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,740
People are jumping on the Disney bandwagon like 20 years too late

601
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:30,220
Yeah, and there's there's grabbing out every single old tale they can and trying to make an epic. Oh, yeah, because it's it's it's

602
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,180
licensed right, yeah

603
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,940
So there's like taking every old not even mythological

604
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,780
There's a couple hundred years old story and you're just like let's make an epic fucking period piece out of this thing

605
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:45,300
Yeah, let's let's like him go over his travels. We can't fuck that one at all

606
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:53,460
Wait, are they actually others? They already made it man. It came out late 2005 or 2006 at Jack Black is Gulliver

607
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,940
Where the fuck was I?

608
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,340
Not watching it, obviously

609
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:03,540
Netflix I watched it as Jason Segel doing possibly the worst English accent I've ever

610
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,100
Mean like I could do a better English accent than that. He's like yours pretty good

611
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,700
It

612
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:18,740
Was it was fucking because go I love girls Travers go I love Gulliver's travel it is my of all classic literature

613
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,220
I'd say it's my favorite book because

614
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,820
It's just it's very it's very

615
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,100
sarcastic

616
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,100
tongue-in-cheek

617
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:36,060
Just really really biting the satirical look on the society at the time and but it's got this whole fancy kind of element to it

618
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:42,060
So if you haven't read it, I definitely recommend don't watch. Why are you recommending like a random book? No, you've related to Jack and the

619
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,860
It gets in the literature anyway

620
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:52,860
Nobody should make another travel movie ever again unless they know I'm decent. Yeah. Okay. Well Jack

621
00:47:52,860 --> 00:48:00,220
Yeah, Jack and the Beanstalk, of course, and apparently the guy played Hurley or you like voices a giant. I think I heard yeah

622
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:06,300
I think I had heard that Jorge Garcia. I think he voices one of the one of the Giants in yeah

623
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:12,380
Only good basically tell who it is to if it if it is him because he's got this massive fro

624
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,300
Only point you actually see them in the trailer is him going

625
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:25,500
Yeah, it might be good for a few laughs but I don't see it being it looks pretty vapid

626
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,140
It's

627
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:32,060
Isn't it vapid if you have kids it'll shut them up for like an hour then they'll get bored

628
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,460
And then you'll never see the end. Yeah

629
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,300
it looks like it's gonna end up being really similar to um, I

630
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:46,420
Can see bombing like horribly the Red Riding Hood the Little Red Riding Hood. Yeah, I could hear you piece

631
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,700
I mean, I could see that that was done destroying itself. Yeah

632
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,500
Is that it?

633
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,620
I feel there was fun. There is a Will Smith one. Oh

634
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,500
Yeah, welcome to after earth. They're more

635
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:04,860
Teaser trailer, right? So there's not much to say and Will Smith and his kid are

636
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,500
Survivors of some kind of spaceship crash. You're right. I go with that at the very end of the trailer Will Smith

637
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
It's like it's like this planet is

638
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,220
And it's like well, yes

639
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,220
It's earth obviously, I thought it was after earth

640
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,580
For some reason all I could think of is after birth

641
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:36,300
In after earth you can pick up after 8 instead of just a Christmas how you're thinking of this

642
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,300
God

643
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:49,280
Yeah, I don't I'm not attacking after birth I think it's kind of it's pretty funny how much

644
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,700
How much?

645
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:55,180
Jaden Smith looks like his old man now, but

646
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:01,780
That's it. Was that kid who was within the same guy who did the karate kid? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I'm straight

647
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,660
Well, the karate kid came out how many years ago? I

648
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:10,500
Don't remember. It was 2008. I think so. Is that 2008 or 2009?

649
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,860
Either way

650
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:19,460
It's been at least two or three years since since he filmed so the kids grown up a lot

651
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:24,620
So he looks like his old man. Anyways, uh, yeah, so all the lot I'd say the most

652
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:29,580
I'd probably want to see Superman steel the most and for me it's Star Trek and Superman

653
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:36,940
Yeah, Superman or just man of steel. Why is it Superman steel suddenly for us? It's man of steel. Yeah. Yeah, it's man of steel

654
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:41,420
Yeah, I'd say man steel and then start right. I'd actually want to see Star Trek more. I like the last movie

655
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,580
It was it was fantastic. It was really JJ Abrams

656
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,620
Actually making something that made sense

657
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:54,460
Wasn't just a bunch of loose ends. That was nice. Although that's also

658
00:50:55,580 --> 00:51:00,060
Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse too. I don't think Carlton Cuse did anything on

659
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,100
the writing

660
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,220
Well on lost. Yeah, but I mean it's the first Star Trek. Oh, well, no, I'm not talking about that

661
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,920
I'm talking about lost. I think the first Star Trek was

662
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:14,220
Damon Lindelof and JJ Abrams. Yeah, there was no Carlton Cuse involved

663
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,060
Either way, it was it was tight made sense. That's the thing

664
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:25,580
Okay. Anyways, that's that's it for trailer talk. Yeah. Yeah, I'm done. I'm totally done. Isn't there one more?

665
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:32,580
You wrote something in your in your phone Oh warm body. Oh, yeah. Oh my god

666
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:40,060
Okay, okay first off for anyone out there who hates Twilight

667
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:44,820
You will hate this even more and I had never even heard of it until Devon. Devon even mentioned it

668
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,820
That thing on your head

669
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:53,660
Okay, so warm bodies is apparently the love story between a zombie and a human

670
00:51:54,460 --> 00:52:01,900
Zombie somehow sees this woman and his heart starts beating again and he regained some kind of

671
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:04,900
some kind of consciousness some kind of

672
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,820
Sense of morality. I don't know

673
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:12,980
I get I'm guessing he still has the taste for human flesh and all that sort of thing because he'll always be haunted by his

674
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,180
desire for

675
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,380
You know for actually eating her

676
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:25,660
She's gonna love that it's it's the stupidest looking movie yeah, it's

677
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:32,060
Horrible, it's just absolutely atrocious. I only know I believe this shit will exist

678
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:36,900
I can only hope that the riff tracks guys do a riff track. Oh, you know, they're going to so I can watch it

679
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,580
Yeah, I'm not gonna watch it

680
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:43,940
I've even finished watching the Twilight movies with riff tracks. I've been putting it off putting it off, but you know what?

681
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:47,680
Yeah, I actually just watched them all of this before I before we went on brick

682
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,200
Christmas break I just I basically I had like a bunch of work around the house to do

683
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,520
Yeah, so I just put on my wireless headphones and I just listened to them for like

684
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:02,740
Ten hours you listen to it. Just yeah, cuz I'm not gonna watch the fucking the going around those cleaning stuff

685
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:06,740
Yeah, see that today like I'm thinking of actually sitting down and watching them

686
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,020
Even though it doesn't make any sense

687
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:13,900
I mean, I mean it doesn't make sense, but also make sense us to actually do what you're doing

688
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,900
Yeah, that's actually a really good idea

689
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,620
God

690
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,660
Just filth. I mean

691
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,740
They must know they're just like cashing in. Oh, yeah

692
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,140
They have how could they not be cashing in?

693
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:35,760
I mean, it's a love story between a supernatural creature and a human they were doing interviews on it

694
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:41,580
Remember like the short little interview ets and like they're yeah, they're trying to talk about like with a straight face

695
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,200
Yeah, they're actually that's the best acting

696
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,820
Much better than the movie itself. Well, maybe the girl ended be in

697
00:53:52,940 --> 00:54:00,500
Better than and Bella's actress fuck. Yeah, she's pretty bland. I still can't believe she's gonna be an on the road

698
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:06,500
She's basically the real-life Brock

699
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,260
Yeah with warm bodies just

700
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:22,900
Jesus Christ that yeah, yeah, I think that's pretty much it more bodies Jesus Christ

701
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,340
You wanna go see are you saying that Jesus Christ is a zombie? Yes

702
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:35,540
I'm gonna wait for it to come to the discount theater that way that we can go and we'll probably get the entire theater ourselves

703
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:40,900
So we could sit there and like throw popcorn at the screen or like actually talk and actually talk

704
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,700
Here's the thing if we can actually put theater to ourselves we could actually film ourselves

705
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:52,760
Wow, that's not illegal. No film ourselves watching it and making fun of it. No actually filming the movie

706
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,100
So stop by apathetic teenagers. I don't think they're gonna care

707
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:01,300
Yeah, that's the great thing about the discount heater he wanted it's a discount

708
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:05,180
Yeah, but also that because it's in like an area of town

709
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:09,940
It's not quite as populated anymore. And you know that mall isn't quite get as much business

710
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:13,980
Oh and like when when you actually would watch a movie there, it's usually pretty empty

711
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,980
Yeah, I remember going there and just having like the entire place to yourself. Yeah

712
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:24,900
I would see Ted and there was yeah, there was just there's a two of us of the just do how do they stay in business?

713
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,900
Because some nights are better than others food

714
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:33,580
Yeah on the food to always the food cheap. Oh god. Yeah. No, no, it's not cheap. Sorry to so bad

715
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,820
It's like reasonable. It's not it's reader. Yeah, I mean, it's like half

716
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:42,780
It's still highly half like Austin Silver City fuck or simplex or whatever and your your average movie theater. It's so

717
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:46,260
That was like I don't go to movies that often

718
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:51,940
So I find it really fucking ridiculous when I like I'm looking at the prices for food 12 bucks for a hot dog and nachos

719
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,740
Oh my gosh, it was like fucking $8

720
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,780
Yeah, yeah, it's five bucks yeah, I got I bought a large and I ended up paying like

721
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:09,820
723 I think which sucks but at the same time there's a lot of food in a large bed

722
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:15,260
Yeah, actually, that's that's pretty considerable. I mean, you'll get I think popcorn farts, but that's okay

723
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,880
That's a risky take right high fiber content

724
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:27,220
I eat high-fiber like normally though with with yeah, I know but it was like fake butter on it

725
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,020
Yeah, that that's man horrible. Oh, man that big butter

726
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,140
Like here's the thing at this theater

727
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,820
You can like buy butter for like 20 cents or something to put on your popcorn, right?

728
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:43,580
And then I said I didn't know you do or you do it for free because this stuff was like I didn't buy the butter

729
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:47,020
But then they grape aside the interest of the theater. There is another station

730
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:51,660
There's like a free there's like a free but I want you just do this and then and Dave's like wall because this better

731
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:58,900
Try to I put it under and I press the button and what comes out is like apple juice. Yeah consistency of

732
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:06,300
Incredibly melted butter. Yeah, it's like pure yellow waters like piss. Just that's basically yeah fucking essentially

733
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:11,980
It's kind of tastes like it too. It just it didn't have a taste to it. It just basically moved up the popcorn

734
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:17,900
Grease, it's extra grease on your popcorn. It's not even like your sock work wherever you want to insert it

735
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:23,900
Just like pouring canola oil onto your popcorn essentially, yeah, that's our butter. It's kind of a little oil. Yeah

736
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:32,420
Okay. Well, that's enough trailer talk. We've been getting incredibly off-base. So I'm gonna enter right here. Anyways, fuck

737
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:38,940
I'm thanks for watching and I'm going what the fuck was that coming in your mouth? That was me saying have a good one

738
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,100
What was the sound?

739
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,240
What is that sound?

740
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,380
You're adorable

741
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,340
Oh, yeah
