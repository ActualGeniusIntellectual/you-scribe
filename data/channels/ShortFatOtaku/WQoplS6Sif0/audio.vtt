WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.600
Hey guys, we just got back from watching The Hobbit. So I thought we'd just do a run through. We got some

00:07.600 --> 00:09.600
AMW burgers

00:09.760 --> 00:15.360
and tea. Should we break them out while we talk? Yeah, you know, it's kind of tradition for us to

00:16.200 --> 00:18.720
Eat crappy food on camera. So

00:19.720 --> 00:21.720
anyways

00:21.720 --> 00:28.320
For those of you who don't really know me. I mean, if they didn't know you, why would they be here? That's true

00:29.000 --> 00:32.840
Anyways, okay, what I'm trying to get at is that I

00:35.960 --> 00:37.960
Have been a

00:38.280 --> 00:45.040
Owls over there. He's playing Red Faction. Thank God I can talk. I was gonna say you can dish while you dish. Excellent!

00:46.120 --> 00:51.780
Right anyways back on the topic. I have been an avid Lord of the Rings fan since I was about 15

00:51.780 --> 00:53.780
Um

00:53.820 --> 00:56.620
These new burgers what for me is actually pretty good

00:57.140 --> 01:04.940
Let's review the burgers instead cuz they're pretty good. Well, I see there's like it's a burger with mayo and cheese and ketchup

01:09.340 --> 01:11.340
Okay, so when I was 15

01:12.140 --> 01:16.400
My my mom tried to get me to read her copy of The Hobbit which I have right here

01:17.660 --> 01:19.740
As my mom's copy. It's missing the back cover

01:20.740 --> 01:22.740
Wonderful and it was um

01:23.540 --> 01:24.820
she

01:24.820 --> 01:27.700
actually purchased a copy of the Sommarillion, which if

01:28.460 --> 01:33.900
You don't know why the fuck would you ever read this? Sommarillion is the history book

01:34.500 --> 01:36.500
it's like the Bible of

01:36.980 --> 01:40.380
Middle Earth it has everything from the beginning or

01:40.820 --> 01:44.420
So they say Eru the one the alluvatar God whatever in halls

01:44.420 --> 01:48.640
I knew also known as well angels and they had this this

01:49.320 --> 01:56.600
This holy symphony and you know, there's more goth or Melkor was like if you haven't noticed

01:56.600 --> 02:02.160
Oh blah blah blah case. You haven't noticed Dave is the ultimate fucking Lord of the Rings nerd asshole

02:02.160 --> 02:06.440
I'm really not and I just I just I that's what I remember though and me

02:06.440 --> 02:09.240
I I don't really care one way either by the series

02:09.240 --> 02:14.320
So we're just kind of I'm the average guy and you're the ultimate fan blood. Oh, so you've been third? Yeah, I did notice

02:14.680 --> 02:18.540
You guys so you got two casuals and pretty much hard for

02:20.600 --> 02:25.560
It was pretty easy to say I mean again I fell asleep during it is there anything less than casual

02:26.480 --> 02:31.260
Apathetic. Oh, okay. So apathetic casual hardcore. We got three levels lethargic

02:35.040 --> 02:36.800
Anyways

02:36.800 --> 02:41.400
so I got pretty hardcore into Lord of the Rings from there I

02:42.400 --> 02:46.920
Watched all I was actually the movie I watch it. What do the movie?

02:47.280 --> 02:49.280
Well, I'm just giving a precursor

02:49.440 --> 02:56.380
Precursors like here's Dave's life regarding Tolkien how much whatever I love. I love Tolkien's work. I love the Hobbit

02:56.380 --> 02:59.360
I love Lord of the Rings. I mean, I've seen all the movies like a thousand times

02:59.360 --> 03:03.560
I own this dick at least three, you know, I you went back in time

03:04.640 --> 03:06.640
Wow, it must show me this

03:06.920 --> 03:08.920
I

03:10.960 --> 03:14.720
Loved the movie I thought was very well done. There are definitely some things that I

03:15.680 --> 03:17.160
wasn't as

03:17.160 --> 03:19.160
overjoyed about but

03:19.200 --> 03:20.800
Here's the thing

03:20.800 --> 03:22.800
they put elements of

03:23.260 --> 03:28.480
something called the unfinished tales into this movie and the unfinished tale is essentially just a collection of

03:29.400 --> 03:31.400
Exactly what it sounds like unfinished tales

03:31.800 --> 03:36.300
That Tolkien wrote during between 1914 and

03:37.160 --> 03:39.160
while basically up to his death and

03:39.680 --> 03:42.240
He never really got them published, but they are all

03:43.760 --> 03:50.280
Relevant to different ages in the Middle Earth universe and one of them is actually a tale of

03:51.840 --> 03:54.320
The the expedition to Erebor

03:54.760 --> 04:00.240
Told through Gandalf's eyes and he goes on a bit about this battle

04:00.880 --> 04:03.560
between the dwarves and the orcs at Moria and

04:04.200 --> 04:07.240
mentions I pretty damn sure he mentions a song and

04:08.600 --> 04:12.240
It was really cool to see all this stuff. That was so originally

04:12.880 --> 04:19.600
That hard that that that that big armless orc guy. Yeah, he wasn't in the Hobbit original. I

04:20.400 --> 04:24.840
Don't think so, I think he was there don't read a book right now to try and find

04:26.440 --> 04:28.400
Thinking he was

04:28.400 --> 04:32.640
Somewhere in there. Maybe but there's so many there's so many characters

04:33.360 --> 04:36.320
Yeah to remember that I mean

04:37.400 --> 04:43.880
Like there this is only the first movie of three and I'll be wrong. They're like halfway through it. Here's here's the thing

04:44.920 --> 04:49.280
This is this is the Hobbit book. Mm-hmm. This is about the same size

04:49.920 --> 04:56.220
One of the three books that make it the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Yep, that trilogy got three movies

04:56.680 --> 04:59.300
This book is getting three movies

05:00.000 --> 05:04.880
That it this this movie is about an hour too long. I think

05:05.720 --> 05:08.240
In our hours two hours too long

05:09.360 --> 05:11.360
So you want you want like a one hour?

05:12.400 --> 05:15.520
50 minute movie. It's like it's like an HBO show

05:16.160 --> 05:18.080
Yeah

05:18.080 --> 05:22.160
It's Game of Thrones watch Game of Thrones. I do have to admit that there were parts that dragged on

05:22.720 --> 05:27.160
The beginning half-hour did think it takes a long time to get going. No, but that's the thing though

05:27.160 --> 05:29.160
I thought it was awesome because

05:30.040 --> 05:33.320
This is a general audience. You have to set up a history

05:34.040 --> 05:39.480
There has to be something established there and I thought the fact that they're showing Erebor is showing the Dwarven Kingdom

05:40.600 --> 05:44.960
They they show Dale they show everything, you know, they show the entire environment around there because

05:46.320 --> 05:51.800
They're not gonna get there until the second movie. Yeah, so they want to show you know

05:52.080 --> 05:58.920
It's not just it's not just a few scribbles on a map. It's a real place with you know, real real towns real people

05:59.600 --> 06:01.920
It's very beautiful. It's very stark

06:01.920 --> 06:07.240
I understand on that but I feel like they could have saved it until the beginning of the second movie to show us my

06:07.240 --> 06:13.760
That it's just not really relevant right now. We're just like and also I also mean like the stuff that's happening with

06:14.480 --> 06:19.100
Bilbo hanging out in his house and they got like all the kind of what's proto. Oh, no

06:19.100 --> 06:22.400
No, well partially that that went a little bit too long

06:22.400 --> 06:26.240
You just had you know Elijah would show up for like a five-second cameo in it

06:26.240 --> 06:29.920
Well, I thought it was and then he's always going they actually have

06:30.640 --> 06:34.680
Even a prologue a prologue to the prologue. Yeah

06:35.280 --> 06:41.040
In Lord of the Rings, it was really weird. I mean it's cool and it kind of like a slice of white

06:42.040 --> 06:44.040
Slice of life

06:44.040 --> 06:45.200
style

06:45.200 --> 06:47.300
Slice of white slice it your way

06:48.360 --> 06:50.800
Yeah, slice of lifestyle. I thought it was kind of cool

06:52.400 --> 07:00.200
They're just kind of padding it's like padding. Oh here here is my I think my biggest personal problem with this movie

07:00.200 --> 07:05.120
Mm-hmm. It was still an alright movie. I'd still definitely recommend people watch it, but

07:05.960 --> 07:07.760
They're taking

07:07.760 --> 07:12.220
They're going out of their way too much to try and link it back to the original three movies

07:12.680 --> 07:17.960
Yeah, like like Frodo shows up for like 20 minutes at the start of the movie and he kind of overstays as welcome

07:17.960 --> 07:19.960
then like later on it has

07:20.320 --> 07:25.680
Gandalf's hanging out with another wizard guy in the two elves. I saw him on and glad you're all yeah

07:26.680 --> 07:28.680
They're all just talking about like

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Well, that's the thing though

07:32.280 --> 07:37.200
There is some kind of council. There's something that goes on believe they actually talk about this necromancer

07:37.200 --> 07:40.720
Yeah, it's only mentioned in the books though. They don't go into detail

07:40.720 --> 07:47.540
Here's my movie the necromancer scene was basically just them trying to talk about you think hook it to the to the three

07:47.960 --> 07:50.160
Movies a little bit more and it has nothing to do with this story

07:50.160 --> 07:54.240
If you cut that scene out this movie would be the exact same. It would not lose anything

07:54.240 --> 07:59.340
Well, they have they should at least mention this the necromancer because they do in the book

07:59.840 --> 08:06.800
It's very really if everything that happens to Gandalf. He just explains it. He says oh I ran into Radagast

08:07.320 --> 08:10.480
And he told me about the necromancer and dull Golder. That's it

08:11.240 --> 08:13.240
Like they don't actually really show Radagast

08:13.680 --> 08:15.720
They don't go on about although

08:15.720 --> 08:21.200
I love the fact that he says the there's he says like there's the five wizards and he says the two was blue wizards

08:21.200 --> 08:23.200
like I don't remember their names because

08:23.440 --> 08:26.720
They don't they don't give the names like I think they give

08:28.020 --> 08:30.440
Elvish names or something that they don't give any human names to them

08:30.560 --> 08:36.760
Yeah, they have the original because the Wizards are actually my are they're all the spirits from the basically from heaven

08:38.160 --> 08:43.520
They're like miners. They're like minor spirits. I got there turned into old men and I know

08:45.080 --> 08:49.420
But I love it. Yeah, and they have a lot of in jokes that really really

08:49.960 --> 08:53.560
Hardcore fan that was kind of funny. How did you just like? Oh, yeah

08:54.840 --> 09:00.080
There's these these two blue guys, and I don't know I don't remember their name

09:00.080 --> 09:02.840
I like how the brown wizard was covered in shit. Yeah

09:03.840 --> 09:07.880
See you make the shit roll down Radagast. Yeah, Radagast was kind of a joke

09:08.400 --> 09:15.480
Don't get me wrong. And he had like a bobsled with like rabbits. Was that from the book too? No

09:17.160 --> 09:18.200
No

09:18.200 --> 09:24.560
No, it was not. I saw it with my mom. She loved that. Wait, where did Radagast go even? I don't even remember him leaving the movie

09:24.840 --> 09:31.320
What happened to him? I remember he was um, he was trying to bait the the war riders. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah

09:31.360 --> 09:35.060
Well, he's least well, yeah, he fucked off because he saw that they were

09:35.840 --> 09:40.220
So they were going after the others and he couldn't get their attention anymore. So I was like, oh shit

09:40.220 --> 09:44.000
I'm just gonna get the hell out of here. I guess let's go home and forget the quest. What an asshole

09:44.840 --> 09:46.600
Like he could fight

09:46.600 --> 09:49.160
He's a proud wizard. What's he gonna do play the brown note?

09:50.440 --> 09:51.880
weird

09:51.880 --> 09:56.920
It's said that Radagast becomes more and more animalistic as years go on. Yeah

09:57.600 --> 10:01.440
Yeah, I don't know if he I don't I don't think he ever actually

10:03.040 --> 10:06.600
Goes because on the end of the Lord of the Rings I actually like they go off to the West or whatever

10:07.440 --> 10:09.320
Right. I don't think it Radagast ever leaves middle

10:09.320 --> 10:13.000
I think he just becomes more and more wild as the years go on more and more crazy

10:13.560 --> 10:20.080
Cuz like Saruman even says that guy he eats too many mushrooms and they add all his brains and they make his teeth yellow

10:20.080 --> 10:22.680
It's like pretty obvious. What kind of mushrooms he's eating

10:22.680 --> 10:26.240
But no, it was a pretty good movie

10:26.360 --> 10:32.120
but my only my only real problems that they seem to shoehorn scenes in to try and link it back to the

10:32.640 --> 10:37.160
The Lord of the Rings trilogy movies that didn't really seem to belong there

10:37.160 --> 10:42.320
Like yeah, if you usually if you're making a movie out of a book you don't

10:43.240 --> 10:48.780
You don't like add things to the book you cut things from the book and I think the mention

10:48.780 --> 10:51.720
They did that Lord of the Rings too though, but like if they were going to

10:52.400 --> 10:57.720
Cut anything from this movie and make it not, you know an ass-numbing three hours of a movie

10:58.920 --> 11:03.120
The first thing to cut would be all the references to the original

11:04.120 --> 11:07.520
Get the necromancy stuff out of there because the movie wouldn't suffer for it

11:07.600 --> 11:15.160
The movie is about the you know, the 13 dwarves hanging out and then fighting but it's it's it's an overarching story though

11:15.640 --> 11:18.000
It's an overarching story connects the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings

11:18.000 --> 11:23.160
It's part of it's part of the overarching story of even just Middle Earth in general

11:23.600 --> 11:30.800
Sauron was the second command of like the of the devil. He is like the devil's right-hand man. He's bail

11:30.800 --> 11:32.800
He's Mephistopheles. He's whatever he's whatever

11:34.440 --> 11:38.400
Everything you're saying but in terms of this movie as

11:38.880 --> 11:42.560
A single day could have just a referenced him and that's it

11:42.560 --> 11:47.260
It didn't need to be they didn't have to didn't have to go to such detail about about the fucking

11:47.720 --> 11:52.240
Fortress then have to go in such detail about about this necromancer

11:52.880 --> 11:57.880
And show him they didn't have to you know, show the the witch kings dagger and all

11:57.880 --> 12:03.400
I mean, I don't remember that that that that doesn't work that that doesn't seem right to me

12:04.200 --> 12:08.640
And don't get me wrong. I mean, well, let's talk about the things we liked about it now. Oh

12:09.480 --> 12:11.120
I

12:11.120 --> 12:15.560
Mean the setting was the exact, you know, the setting for all the same was really nice to see the old

12:16.440 --> 12:18.960
settings from that they were using Lord of the Rings

12:19.480 --> 12:27.200
Rivendell and in the river Brunin and the trolls the trolls were awesome. Yeah, they're hilarious. Oh, man

12:27.200 --> 12:30.160
Okay, I actually wanted to lean over and whisper this to you

12:30.800 --> 12:32.800
India I

12:32.920 --> 12:38.560
Wanted to lean over a student theater context. Yeah, I wanted to lean over and whisper this student theater

12:38.560 --> 12:45.520
but it's like the scene kept going really quickly, so I just didn't but when when you see Galadriel for the first time and

12:46.360 --> 12:50.360
Like she's staying there. She's like that long long ass gala kind of flowers out onto the floor

12:50.360 --> 12:55.440
Yeah, and then like she rotates in place rather than just stepping she rotates in place

12:55.440 --> 12:59.380
You could turn I think and I could down like twists up her as she just turns out. It's like hey guys

12:59.380 --> 13:01.520
I was thinking she was on one of those

13:01.520 --> 13:07.180
Um, oh like a turntable those shitty ad machines like you sound like you just like move your hips and you swing back

13:09.280 --> 13:12.060
I was like that's the first thing comes in your mind

13:18.800 --> 13:20.800
There were a lot of

13:20.880 --> 13:26.120
Moments in this in this movie that were goofy and we're forgivable because it's a fantasy movie

13:26.120 --> 13:31.220
Well, because it's like it's a it's a children's book. Yeah, it's well it was marketed as a children's book

13:31.320 --> 13:36.640
Yeah, don't get me wrong. They made it a lot darker. Yeah a lot darker. I mean

13:37.600 --> 13:39.840
They even right from the beginning I mean

13:40.840 --> 13:44.440
We're showing up and I think they wanted to keep the same audience in the same

13:44.600 --> 13:49.460
Yeah to say the same tone as the original three movie, but they were all singing. They kept the singing in

13:49.460 --> 13:52.680
Yeah, that's kind of good. It wasn't. Oh, but it wasn't it wasn't like all

13:54.200 --> 13:59.920
Ponce here like that. It wasn't quite I know there. There are some ponds to like that first song where they're singing

13:59.920 --> 14:02.140
Yeah, well cracking the plates and all that. Yeah

14:02.940 --> 14:08.540
That's just a thing though, they they gotta keep stuff like that in because it it's part of what made

14:09.180 --> 14:13.340
It added that that or of whimsy to the original book

14:13.340 --> 14:19.620
Yeah, so I mean they took they took so much out of Lord of the Rings. That was that was whimsical

14:19.620 --> 14:22.020
There was a there was a lot of singing there was a lot of

14:22.540 --> 14:23.860
light hard

14:23.860 --> 14:28.380
Somewhat light harness to the elves themselves, but more in the Hobbit

14:28.620 --> 14:34.220
They are they're like they're actually a bunch of well trolls and I'm talking internet trolls

14:35.620 --> 14:41.120
Joking around with people they like fucking with people's minds. Oh, here's a fucking thing. What's the book? Sorry?

14:42.140 --> 14:44.460
Here's the thing. I remember the

14:45.020 --> 14:50.740
big thing about Lord of the Rings is how come Gandalf didn't get those fucking birds and like fly fly the fucking ring over and

14:50.740 --> 14:54.540
Everyone who says that everyone who replies that says well Gandalf didn't have the birds yet

14:54.540 --> 14:59.620
Yeah, and like by the time the end of the third fucking movie comes around he has the birds to use it's like, okay

14:59.620 --> 15:04.240
Fine in this movie. He uses the birds. No, the birds are there and this is before the first

15:05.060 --> 15:11.900
I could have sworn he uses that boss an asshole. Yeah. Yes. Um, it's up to the birds to decide but okay

15:12.060 --> 15:14.760
If he they just get dumped off like that

15:15.380 --> 15:21.900
It takes away all these all these events. I mean the whole point of these stories. It's not okay. It's a story

15:22.740 --> 15:24.740
Development at the same time

15:24.900 --> 15:30.100
In the context of the people living in that world. Why wouldn't they oh, I know I know

15:30.100 --> 15:36.900
I know under the context of the in the in-world process. It would make so much more sense just to get a lift

15:36.900 --> 15:38.900
I mean, what would you rather walk?

15:39.580 --> 15:42.560
We're gonna ride. So I've heard some people say that like

15:43.820 --> 15:48.020
Sirens tower there how they can have like a laser eye beam coming to the eye that would like shoot the Eagles maybe

15:48.500 --> 15:52.660
But I'm not sure if that's actually a thing. Well, yeah, why won't you knock it off?

15:54.220 --> 16:00.660
If that's the case then why wouldn't the I be shooting lasers at the army from from Gondor

16:02.180 --> 16:06.900
No, I think people are just being idiots I mean seriously laser I also know

16:08.140 --> 16:14.620
The the undead human kings there who had like those 13 other rings. Yeah, they had like they were riding dragons, right?

16:15.060 --> 16:19.380
They're right dragon that's cool. Yeah. Yeah. So like I guess they could like done like

16:20.100 --> 16:22.100
Air support type thing

16:22.260 --> 16:27.900
Against against the Eagles. I don't why wasn't it like an aerial battle in Lord of the Rings like Eagles vs. Dragons, man

16:28.660 --> 16:33.900
Or sure, they did attack them at the end. Yeah, it was like like a two-second scene

16:33.900 --> 16:38.840
Yeah, that should have been like the main focus of the entire fucking war was like the aerial battle

16:39.340 --> 16:41.340
This isn't World War one

16:41.940 --> 16:43.540
dog fights

16:43.540 --> 16:50.380
The whole point of this you've gotten away the fuck off track. Yeah, you're going on these tangents about about things that

16:51.100 --> 16:53.720
Okay. Yeah, I mean you're the English guy

16:55.620 --> 16:57.620
Here's here's the thing is that

16:58.200 --> 17:01.660
One thing that I mean it didn't ruin the movie for me

17:01.660 --> 17:06.620
But I did wonder this constantly throughout the movie is how come some of the dwarves?

17:06.980 --> 17:11.460
Had like the big beards the big noses the big hands and arms

17:11.700 --> 17:16.180
They had like the dwarven body and some of them were just like tiny humans. Yeah. Yeah

17:17.220 --> 17:21.700
Billy Kelly Thorin they just didn't put the makeup on those guys. I wonder why they didn't do that

17:22.260 --> 17:27.140
Are they actually they're actually different types of dwarf that are just like less nosy. No

17:27.420 --> 17:31.680
Well, there are I think there are different types of dwarves but these but these guys are all Arab war doors

17:31.680 --> 17:36.560
They're all they're all from the same place. Yes, but at the same time

17:37.440 --> 17:40.400
Maybe you just wanted some of the doors to look goofy and something to look serious

17:42.520 --> 17:47.920
I think there's like the guy there's the one guy who had just the beard not the the mustache

17:47.920 --> 17:53.580
He was like a younger guy with the like the ginger beard. I think they're trying to make him look younger and kind of dopey

17:54.280 --> 18:00.260
Philly and Kelly, you know Thorin's these are actually thorns cut first cousins. Yeah, that's why they're there

18:00.260 --> 18:02.400
They're so they're so tight with them. Yeah

18:02.960 --> 18:08.280
They are they are very young by dwarven standards that I and that's that's why they make them

18:08.360 --> 18:12.080
They're their beards are much shorter that sort of thing. Yeah, I'm Thorin

18:12.080 --> 18:15.680
I think they just wanted to give them more of a sense of nobility. I

18:16.080 --> 18:20.640
Feel like they just wanted to at least put a couple of hot toddies

18:20.640 --> 18:27.000
Yeah, pretty much good-looking male actors into the movie just they all weren't because Martin Freeman's kind of like just mr. Average

18:27.840 --> 18:32.360
I think they just they they just wanted to put in a couple of decent looking

18:32.760 --> 18:37.240
Human looking actors and have it the right instead of like having an entire cast like an old man

18:37.240 --> 18:39.440
And like a bunch of midgets with like big noses

18:40.040 --> 18:46.200
You know, they actually wanted to make someone look half half human creams machines old man

18:46.200 --> 18:48.200
That's some some midgets. Yeah

18:49.960 --> 18:51.960
Old man the midget source

18:53.120 --> 18:54.520
Well

18:54.520 --> 18:56.840
Yeah, I also I'm disappointed that

18:58.200 --> 19:00.200
We didn't get to the dragon this time

19:01.160 --> 19:02.480
That it's build up

19:02.480 --> 19:05.840
I know but like they but you can't spend a full movie on Bill

19:05.840 --> 19:10.200
I think if you build up for the first third of a movie they can't show them at all

19:10.320 --> 19:15.520
But they should have like they spend this entire time talking about the dragon as being the biggest threat and it doesn't show up

19:16.680 --> 19:20.120
Until the very end where it like blinks out of the gold pot. I was like, yeah

19:20.720 --> 19:27.160
As soon as I saw the dragon slowly it's a hook as soon as I saw the dragon slowly emerge from the pile of gold

19:27.160 --> 19:29.880
I was like this movie's ending on his eye

19:30.440 --> 19:32.440
Probably opening up into it

19:32.960 --> 19:39.120
It did yeah. Yeah, there was some predictability there. Yeah, it's it's unfortunate

19:41.200 --> 19:43.200
Why do dragons that go

19:43.200 --> 19:48.720
What's the deal with that? Uh, they're just wicked cruel greedy, but they can't spend it. They don't they don't care

19:49.600 --> 19:55.560
That's the whole thing it's like a crow they just grab shiny things a lot of ancient mythology, you know

19:55.560 --> 19:57.560
He's drawing ancient mythology, right?

19:57.600 --> 20:00.160
Why are you question? You know, I read way more

20:01.240 --> 20:05.520
Mythological because this he's a literature that I have so basically

20:06.400 --> 20:08.400
Because I like things to be explained

20:10.240 --> 20:17.480
Okay, okay here here's something that you may not have learned right by now is not everything spoon-fed

20:18.720 --> 20:21.880
You have to sometimes it takes learning things on your own

20:23.040 --> 20:25.360
I'm not doing homework to go to a fucking movie

20:28.120 --> 20:31.440
Or or or okay, sometimes just take things as I are

20:32.280 --> 20:38.240
Not question that shit out of them. No, no, that's what we do. That's what we do here on the site

20:41.760 --> 20:44.800
That's what I've been doing all this time, yep, okay

20:45.360 --> 20:47.600
No, it was it was a good movie I liked it

20:47.600 --> 20:53.080
I was uh, you know, they all all my nitpicks are just nitpicks and it was overall pretty good. No, I

20:53.960 --> 20:55.960
For the most part. I agree

20:56.680 --> 21:02.240
The actor plays Gandalf looks significantly older this time though, sir. You become yeah, he's ten years older. Yeah

21:02.480 --> 21:06.080
Yeah, that's one thing I didn't worry. He's supposed to be younger, but he looks older. Yeah

21:06.600 --> 21:09.920
Well, that is the thing. Yeah, that is a thing with it. Well, yeah

21:10.360 --> 21:16.000
That's one of those things that you just sometimes can't get around with all the makeup in the world don't necessarily get around it

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Yeah, it's just one of those things

21:18.440 --> 21:23.120
Especially if he's got any allergy to the makeup, you know, yeah, it's gonna screw him up

21:23.120 --> 21:27.480
And you think guys are old like I mean, he's got to be he's got to be about 80 by now

21:27.760 --> 21:32.440
But is he Christopher Lee's got to be older than that even Christopher Christopher Lee is like 88

21:32.440 --> 21:35.240
I swear to God and he's like hand this movie to you for a little bit

21:35.240 --> 21:41.000
Yeah, I think I see is always only show up in the book too. Yeah, I think I'm pretty sure he did

21:41.000 --> 21:43.160
It's really was in the book. Yes, Chris

21:44.640 --> 21:46.640
Yes, Christopher Lee as

21:47.120 --> 21:52.680
Christopher Lee as the necromancer. He actually turns out to be Dracula to show up in the book. It's actually a hammer film

21:53.240 --> 21:59.040
You know, it's it's it's it's a it's a huge tribute to hammer films. They're just gonna have you know

21:59.560 --> 22:01.560
Gandalf be a a

22:02.680 --> 22:04.680
Vampire Slayer

22:06.240 --> 22:08.240
God

22:09.400 --> 22:11.200
What's wrong with me

22:11.200 --> 22:12.760
anyways

22:12.760 --> 22:18.360
For anyone who is a hardcore fan hasn't seen it. Why haven't you seen it yet? Why the hell happens?

22:18.360 --> 22:20.360
Like we had a good excuse

22:20.520 --> 22:25.720
We're we're in our home. Yeah, we're in our hometown for Christmas. Yeah, there's no theater there

22:25.720 --> 22:30.720
So you so guys they're useful. Yeah, it closed 17 years ago then it became a strip club

22:30.720 --> 22:32.720
then we came to strip club and now it is a

22:32.720 --> 22:39.400
Education center slash temp agency is it not and it's also like a

22:40.160 --> 22:43.840
Don't know. Oh, yeah. It's a cry dojo. Yeah, forget that. Yeah

22:47.240 --> 22:51.560
Anyways, yeah, so for hardcore fans definitely definitely a must-see

22:51.880 --> 22:55.200
There's a lot of things that I get thrown in there. I

22:55.760 --> 23:01.480
Probably didn't even recognize half of them because I mean it's been a while. I haven't read Unfinished Tales in like five years

23:01.920 --> 23:03.080
I

23:03.080 --> 23:05.080
Hadn't read the Hobbit in a few years either

23:05.120 --> 23:09.080
So there's all you know, this is one of those things one of the movies definitely

23:09.080 --> 23:15.000
I definitely recommend watching more than once just to catch it all def is this you just to catch all of the

23:15.600 --> 23:22.360
All these little things they add in it's it's amazing how much you want to see it already in 2d in 1d or?

23:22.920 --> 23:26.160
Or an avx because we only watch the 3d we didn't watch the avx one

23:26.160 --> 23:29.640
So I actually do want to see the avx one the hyper real version

23:30.640 --> 23:32.640
3d wasn't really

23:33.200 --> 23:39.680
That good. No, it wasn't the 3d 3d was it was very lackluster. I thought that I mean, I don't I know

23:39.680 --> 23:41.360
I got I don't know if you guys do this

23:41.360 --> 23:45.080
But like sometimes during a 3d movie I like take off the glasses and see if there's any difference everyone

23:45.400 --> 23:50.080
There's there's barely any yeah, it's ridiculous. I mean during during like the

23:52.800 --> 23:54.840
Every single action set piece

23:55.480 --> 24:01.280
Yeah, there was always like there's like there's like rocks flying at the camera from like a sword impact in the ground

24:01.280 --> 24:03.960
And there was like a piece of wood flake. There's always stuff. Yeah

24:04.720 --> 24:11.040
You see you see some 3d there, but like rest of the movies just flat. Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty flat

24:11.040 --> 24:15.060
I mean if I was gonna watch this, I just watch some blu-ray when they watch

24:16.480 --> 24:21.400
TV or anything like that. I wouldn't bother it. I have a 3d TV. So that's easy. Well, I know exactly

24:22.400 --> 24:24.400
Just makes things easier for everyone

24:24.720 --> 24:29.020
Yeah, I really um, I wonder what the the extended edition of this movie is gonna be like

24:30.120 --> 24:37.360
16 hours some of the dramatic pauses just I can't wait hours. This is the guy who watched like

24:38.520 --> 24:40.960
Every not only to watch all the extended editions

24:40.960 --> 24:44.380
But I watched I made sure every thing cuz I would get two thousand one thousand two

24:44.680 --> 24:50.440
2003 they do have the extensions coming out and I'd sit there and I'd watch all the special features like back to back to back

24:50.960 --> 24:57.420
You're fucking loser. I was I was a nice kid. I had almost free time. I had nothing else to do

24:57.420 --> 24:59.720
So I was like fuck and I'm just gonna watch all the special feature stuff

24:59.720 --> 25:04.200
And then I saw there's this guy there who's like a elvish language expert and he's in more

25:04.200 --> 25:08.400
But he's like the geekiest guy I've ever seen my ladies. This guy is single

25:12.280 --> 25:15.280
Anyways, yeah, it's an alright movie

25:15.280 --> 25:17.080
I

25:17.080 --> 25:22.200
Is definitely more just alright, I feel like it is an average movie that most people will enjoy

25:22.200 --> 25:27.120
Um, but you know, we're gonna touch on something was major to like it's the Gollum scene

25:27.920 --> 25:30.800
Well, we're not too long to that. Yes, I agree

25:30.800 --> 25:36.800
I think went on too long what I really hope they would have done instead and I know it's because they've already established

25:36.800 --> 25:43.780
Gollum is a is a character because this is a prequel it's coming out after yeah after Lord of the Rings if they showed him

25:43.780 --> 25:45.180
less debilitated

25:45.180 --> 25:47.260
If they hadn't really shown him at all

25:47.260 --> 25:52.080
They've just shown him it look the only times that I really got the creeps was when they showed him up in the background

25:52.460 --> 25:58.740
And with his eyes shining like that because in the book in the book, they established Gollum very very well

25:58.740 --> 26:01.200
It's very very creepy. There's this vibe

26:01.900 --> 26:08.420
The way that we okay describes Gollum. He's just this little this slide questions in the book with the riddles. Yes

26:08.420 --> 26:13.220
Yes, they do that. I love I love the fact they kept that in they kept that the whole context in there

26:13.260 --> 26:15.180
Is it in the book?

26:15.180 --> 26:21.700
It's like they don't really show him. I mean, yes as a book the way it's described it, you know in the movie

26:21.700 --> 26:27.300
I would just barely show him. I just show the eyes. I wouldn't have him actually, you know grappling with them or anything like that

26:28.660 --> 26:30.660
um

26:30.660 --> 26:37.020
It just it felt like they're they're more or less just showcasing the technology like oh look what we can do now

26:37.020 --> 26:39.160
It's ten years later. He looks so much better. Yeah

26:39.800 --> 26:45.360
Yes, we're aware the technology is advanced that much you don't have to show it in the terms of just

26:45.880 --> 26:48.760
In just terms of build-up, it would have been all show up later

26:49.640 --> 26:55.560
In the rest of the book. No, so he won't be in like a movie two and three unless they just do something stupid

26:55.760 --> 27:01.600
Yeah, that's exactly it. He'll just show up the background. No, yeah. Hi guys. He doesn't this is this is it

27:01.600 --> 27:03.600
Like this is how he gets the ring

27:03.960 --> 27:08.640
Gollum he sees Gollum. He's about to you know, he's about to kill him or whatever and you know

27:08.640 --> 27:13.000
He feels sorry for him and you know what when I saw that that I actually got him up my throat

27:13.560 --> 27:16.300
When I'm gone, but like this the single tear and all that

27:16.800 --> 27:19.480
Um, he just looks so pitiful. He really does

27:19.480 --> 27:24.240
He looks like the saddest motherfucker of all time. Like he just lost his entire family because that's all he has

27:24.360 --> 27:28.600
This is like a Native American looking out at his wasteland of a country

27:29.360 --> 27:31.360
as like single to

27:34.520 --> 27:36.520
There's

27:40.240 --> 27:47.360
Just walking through the waters are eating and just eating McDonald's and throwing shit all over the reading a W and throwing

27:52.960 --> 27:59.040
No, no, he just he seemed he's just seems so pathetic and I felt I felt really bad for the character the kinship

27:59.400 --> 28:02.260
Well, he's he's an it's it's now a game ship

28:03.920 --> 28:05.920
Between you and him. Yeah, sure

28:06.680 --> 28:08.680
He's more like an act full of drug addicts

28:08.680 --> 28:14.000
This is exactly what it's supposed to be is he's addicted to the power that that the ring gives them

28:14.600 --> 28:16.600
and it's all he knows and

28:17.200 --> 28:24.000
Once he realizes it's gone from that. He may not ever get it back. He he's a you know, he becomes what?

28:24.520 --> 28:27.160
He really is just a crushed old hobbit

28:27.200 --> 28:33.320
That's all he is just an empty shell of a hobbit or whatever the hell he has like close to

28:33.760 --> 28:36.920
So from here on Bilbo just basically keeps the ring in his pocket

28:36.920 --> 28:40.120
He gets home and keeps in his trunk and then like yeah for like the next 60 years

28:40.120 --> 28:44.600
No ill effects despite like it just fucks up everybody else. Uh, what are you talking about?

28:44.600 --> 28:50.680
Well, no, there's no ill effects per se other than a game. He becomes addicted to it and it gave me a screamer face

28:53.400 --> 28:55.400
Yeah, and

28:55.960 --> 28:58.320
You know and kept him looking young of course

28:58.320 --> 29:03.480
he's very he looks basically the same the thing is like I can understand why they get a

29:03.600 --> 29:10.000
Younger guy to play him because I mean Ian home is he's no spring-chicken either. He's got to be about 70 by now

29:10.000 --> 29:13.120
I mean like all the shit that they make him. Oh, that's okay. Um

29:14.200 --> 29:19.000
They fall so far in this movie everyone falls like oh all the time

29:19.000 --> 29:23.080
It's true. They're in the this cave with all these goblins and shit and they fall like

29:23.560 --> 29:27.640
500 feet and none of them are injured like maybe bruised

29:28.480 --> 29:33.240
But no eternal Henry like I don't see anyone spitting up blood. I don't see any broken bones

29:33.240 --> 29:37.600
I don't you know, I don't see any cuts any lacerations or was it?

29:38.720 --> 29:40.720
lacerations

29:41.960 --> 29:45.560
There's three of them lacerations evisceration eviscerations in

29:46.600 --> 29:48.440
Incineration. Yeah

29:48.440 --> 29:51.800
Yeah, there's there are none of those things when when they fall

29:51.800 --> 29:57.900
Well, I mean obviously like the incineration isn't relevant, but the other two they fall so fucking much

29:58.640 --> 30:06.880
Nobody ever gets like super injured just scrapes and bruises. It's like that that doesn't seem right. I know dwarves are hardy, but

30:07.640 --> 30:09.640
It doesn't seem very also

30:10.000 --> 30:15.200
like it must have happened at least three times in this movie where like Gandalf fucks off and

30:15.400 --> 30:19.760
Like in the moment, they've been like the party gets in trouble and get over. Yeah, that's how I did

30:19.760 --> 30:21.920
Yeah, that happens. I'm back guys. It just kills him

30:21.920 --> 30:27.700
That's how it happens in the book because in the book Gandalf is supposed to have an air of mystery to him

30:27.920 --> 30:29.320
He's an enigma

30:29.320 --> 30:32.520
You know, they make him seem a little bit more human in the movie

30:32.520 --> 30:37.440
They really do because they show what he does but in the book, it's just like he'll he'll come back, you know

30:37.440 --> 30:42.880
He'll shit. He'll save their ass and then he'll kind of give a somewhat vague answer or you know, like

30:42.880 --> 30:44.520
Maybe

30:44.520 --> 30:49.800
One or two occasions. He'll actually explain what he was doing, but that's it. It's just an explanation

30:50.360 --> 30:55.300
It's not actually showing him going to you know, they'll go there and blah blah blah

30:55.960 --> 30:57.960
Yeah, yeah

30:58.000 --> 31:02.720
You tried to end this thing now for like three three times and David, you know, I was like, oh I remember something else

31:02.720 --> 31:08.840
I know there's so there are so many things to discuss about it. Well, I mean, that's just like the movie itself

31:08.840 --> 31:10.840
They keep on trying to end it

31:13.200 --> 31:14.400
And

31:14.400 --> 31:18.720
Personally, I'm I'm not offended by it. I didn't at no point did I feel bored

31:19.680 --> 31:25.760
Actually, you know what? Technically this movie is not called The Hobbit. It's called an unexpected. Well, it's The Hobbit

31:26.440 --> 31:29.720
colon unexpected journey, but you didn't see the words The Hobbit weren't in the movie

31:31.960 --> 31:36.440
When you finally see the opening title card of the movie it just says an unexpected journey actually

31:36.440 --> 31:39.920
Yeah, they should have just said The Hobbit because it's in the Lord of the Rings. It started off Lord of the Rings

31:40.760 --> 31:44.760
And then you know Lord of the Rings and then Fellowship of the Rings but like Lord of the Rings

31:44.760 --> 31:48.840
I mean they started off a little because it's it's it's technically one book

31:49.400 --> 31:51.400
Yeah, yeah

31:52.680 --> 31:54.680
PJ you're

31:55.400 --> 31:57.400
Kind of you're kind of hit or miss everybody

31:57.680 --> 32:02.680
Fuck Oh Peter Jackson. Gotcha. It's you know what? I think it is losing all that weight

32:02.680 --> 32:10.400
He lost all the weight in his brain. No, I'm just fucking no no I

32:11.600 --> 32:16.760
Yeah, I really I really thought it was well done, you know, everything every movie has its warts

32:16.760 --> 32:22.280
So I you know, I'm not gonna give it like a numerical value like that because really yeah

32:22.280 --> 32:26.680
I don't see much point if you're if you don't like fantasy this won't convert you

32:27.240 --> 32:31.680
If you're not a big Lord of the Rings fan, but you just want to watch something just just to watch it

32:31.680 --> 32:34.000
This will entertain you for a while, but then you'll forget about it

32:34.240 --> 32:37.920
It's really only gonna be memorable to see you care in the first place. I

32:38.960 --> 32:43.680
Think and yet it's the highest grossing movie of the year. It's one of the highest

32:43.680 --> 32:49.120
It's possibly the highest grossing movie of all time. So I don't think you're on the button there, man

32:49.120 --> 32:53.880
I really don't because if it made that much money, that means people are going back from multiple viewings

32:54.720 --> 33:01.020
Multiple which means it must be good enough for a lot of people or that people are just becoming more more

33:01.660 --> 33:03.660
Fantasy, I think that's an ad. Yes

33:07.060 --> 33:11.060
For sure, but no if this is a movie that you don't like this won't change your mind

33:11.060 --> 33:16.860
But about me if you don't like fantasy, this isn't gonna make you love something about fantasy. This is not a gateway movie

33:22.220 --> 33:27.720
Yeah, oh god now if you actually want to get into fantasy I'd suggest watching the Brit

33:27.720 --> 33:29.720
Mmm

33:30.240 --> 33:32.240
Fuck yeah

33:33.440 --> 33:38.120
Yeah, it's a hands-on approach really really wet to all the ideas

33:39.560 --> 33:42.080
If you want to get into fantasy watch willow

33:44.200 --> 33:46.000
Oh

33:46.000 --> 33:51.680
My watch labyrinth. All right, we've got that's a wrong fantasy

33:51.680 --> 33:53.680
Oh

33:53.960 --> 33:55.960
That's the kind of fantasy if you want like, you know

33:58.880 --> 34:02.880
With his bulge with this bulge. Oh, yeah, cuz he reminds me of the babe

34:06.040 --> 34:08.040
So say what babe oh no

34:08.640 --> 34:13.880
That one's completely over my head and what babe the baby the power what power the power of voodoo who do you know?

34:13.880 --> 34:15.560
Okay. Anyways, whatever

34:15.560 --> 34:19.680
This has become completely irreverent completely irrelevant. Anyway

34:20.680 --> 34:24.120
Anyways, definitely two thumbs up for me

34:25.240 --> 34:30.500
Okay, that is a numerical thing. Yeah, it's two. Oh, no. I just ripped off Cisco neighbor

34:32.680 --> 34:34.560
Definitely definitely

34:34.560 --> 34:39.960
Very very high recommendation from me as a hardcore fan it it really does appeal

34:40.120 --> 34:45.720
This is this is not the fifth time you've said it's because it's true and to the casual person

34:45.760 --> 34:49.480
I still recommend it because it is a blockbuster. It does have a lot of

34:50.440 --> 34:52.440
you know great effects and

34:53.160 --> 34:55.160
incredible environments

34:55.600 --> 34:56.960
very

34:56.960 --> 35:00.920
You know wonderful music the score is is pretty much impeccable

35:00.920 --> 35:04.200
They tied a lot of Lord of the Rings themes in there because a lot of the characters

35:04.840 --> 35:10.400
No, but like some of the characters are still there. So they keep their themes and I thought it flowed very nicely

35:12.000 --> 35:15.320
So yeah overall it was it was very good

35:15.720 --> 35:20.820
Anyways, I look back in a bit and talk about the trailers that came before the movie

35:23.520 --> 35:24.760
Wow

35:24.760 --> 35:28.920
That is opposed to the ones after them. So the trailer is gonna be talking about the trailer. Yes

35:29.200 --> 35:31.980
Okay. Okay. We're back in a bit to actually talk about the trailers

35:36.000 --> 35:42.280
Okay, the trailers what shows you even get we got man of steel we got

35:45.720 --> 35:47.720
a

35:49.080 --> 35:53.360
Side red faction really fucked up. Yeah, I was just kind of

35:54.400 --> 35:58.360
Jumping humping the ground even though he was like buried in the ground. Okay, whatever

35:59.320 --> 36:01.320
Yeah, we got man of steel

36:03.760 --> 36:08.080
You got Will Smith's vehicle for his child, yeah after earth

36:08.080 --> 36:10.080
Yeah

36:10.840 --> 36:16.380
See Al gone I said I said welcome to earth to Daphne he didn't get it. I was like you fucking suck

36:19.120 --> 36:25.640
Yeah, yeah, I have to giant killer that's it and of course it is a good date a good day to die hard

36:25.840 --> 36:29.800
Yeah, I didn't get that wasn't there? No, no. Okay. Well, I saw it

36:30.440 --> 36:36.040
What else was there Star Trek? Oh, it's our truck. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's a lot of jumping off buildings

36:36.040 --> 36:41.720
Yeah, times a job, but I feel like a lot a lot of breaking the only thing I have to say about just trailers nowadays

36:41.720 --> 36:43.720
in general is

36:45.800 --> 36:47.800
Wow

36:48.120 --> 36:53.160
That's that is what every soundtrack for every trailer is now it's like

36:57.640 --> 36:59.840
It's yeah something and then cuts a black

36:59.840 --> 37:01.840
Wow

37:02.520 --> 37:06.760
It really is like they sample two seconds from a dubstep song

37:09.280 --> 37:15.040
I was like once the movie to start Gandalf would be like, yeah, there's that rat a guy's guy

37:19.640 --> 37:25.120
Actually if they just did they showed one one little blip of him that would be fucking creepy

37:25.960 --> 37:31.400
This old man in a brown just brown robes with shit all over his face

37:33.560 --> 37:37.560
He's looking like this when he knows there's like dark magic food he's like

37:38.720 --> 37:43.880
It was like the you know, the the dramatic chipmunk or direct school or whatever the hell it is. Yeah

37:45.360 --> 37:50.000
Yeah, like that shit all over space that's exactly what it looks like

37:51.400 --> 37:54.080
You got to poop on I gotta say

37:55.120 --> 37:59.520
I don't know you you really you really impressed with the die-hard one

37:59.520 --> 38:06.340
I I've only seen the first one so I can't really say. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I like I like yeah, I had movies

38:06.340 --> 38:08.520
They're pretty cool. They're the best Christmas movies

38:10.360 --> 38:13.800
Like this, you know, I like to say Bad Santa's one of the best ones yeah

38:15.800 --> 38:19.160
How many times is Alan Rickman fall out of a window in Bad Santa

38:20.160 --> 38:22.160
a lot

38:22.280 --> 38:24.280
Well, there's the deleted scenes

38:27.680 --> 38:33.760
But actually he goes he goes into the set of every Christmas movie ever made since Die Hard and he insists on being dropped

38:33.760 --> 38:35.760
out of the window

38:41.760 --> 38:43.760
Harry Marvin

38:45.480 --> 38:47.480
I think

38:49.160 --> 38:51.160
Oh

38:52.640 --> 38:54.640
Okay, yeah, so

38:56.080 --> 38:59.840
Die hard looked look like a good trailer, but I mean, you know

39:00.360 --> 39:04.000
Like you don't need a trailer for Die Hard. You know what it is. Yeah, it's Die Hard

39:04.000 --> 39:10.760
It's it's John McClane going out and getting shot at and falling and falling really far and apparently not dying

39:11.560 --> 39:13.560
Having a foot meter. Yes

39:14.320 --> 39:20.280
Wait, you'll get that one. No, you know diehard NES game. Oh fuck. Oh god

39:22.240 --> 39:25.960
Okay, that's why I probably stabbed some part of my brain after I saw that

39:27.600 --> 39:33.200
Partial lobotomy what else we had then Man of Steel came up that looks at that, you know, I'm excited

39:33.200 --> 39:35.960
I mean, I like there was no wow

39:36.360 --> 39:39.040
Yeah, there's no walk to it and you know

39:39.040 --> 39:45.040
I love this the setup him walking around in the Arctic. They don't show the fortress of solitude, but that's okay

39:45.560 --> 39:52.640
It's like I love the fact it's Kevin. It's Kevin Costner playing. It's playing. It's dad adopted dad

39:53.400 --> 39:55.920
Well, I don't know who plays his mom, but that's okay

39:56.600 --> 40:02.400
I mean, he's like sure the villain in the trailer if you noticed that yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah

40:02.400 --> 40:06.760
I don't I don't really know who it is. I don't recognize general Zod. Yeah, Neil before Zod

40:09.080 --> 40:15.440
Okay, nevermind it just it's I guess it's on I remember for the longest time the reason why they didn't want to

40:15.920 --> 40:18.240
Make make any more Superman movies after

40:19.120 --> 40:21.120
the sixth room Christopher Reeve Oh

40:21.680 --> 40:28.880
Had done his bit is because they couldn't find good villains to go up against Superman. You know, yeah

40:28.880 --> 40:31.280
Cuz I don't but Kevin Spacey

40:32.040 --> 40:36.080
Like with Batman you have the Joker. He has his

40:36.080 --> 40:42.280
Easy intent this is right there his his really famous arch-nemesis that always gives him a run for his money. Yeah

40:43.480 --> 40:50.440
With Superman, there's not really anybody like that Lex Luthor. Yeah, but he's not quite filmable Lex Luthor

40:50.840 --> 40:52.560
Brainiac Zod

40:52.560 --> 40:56.360
It's really just Zod. I do today in terms of

40:57.880 --> 41:02.080
In terms of making it work for a film it really is just general Zod

41:03.960 --> 41:05.960
Yeah, I guess

41:06.360 --> 41:08.360
It's good

41:09.440 --> 41:11.440
Now speculation

41:11.640 --> 41:17.560
About the Star Trek movie into darkness. Oh, we're done talking Superman. Well, there's not really much else to say

41:17.560 --> 41:24.040
You're gonna say Connor. Oh, here's what you're gonna say Todd. I I was like, I don't know. I don't even yeah

41:24.440 --> 41:26.440
No, no, no, it's calm

41:27.160 --> 41:30.600
You saw it. What if it's gone before we move on?

41:31.360 --> 41:36.000
Okay, um a good nice little loop that the Superman

41:36.080 --> 41:43.320
Trailer has created is that the first teaser trailer for Superman used the soundtrack from Lord of the Rings?

41:44.000 --> 41:47.200
When Gandalf died in the first movie you remember that?

41:55.640 --> 41:57.720
You guys they're right when you when you saw the

41:59.080 --> 42:04.840
Yeah, and they I saw the YouTube Collins and everyone's like you guys are seeing like from Lord of the Rings

42:04.880 --> 42:11.400
Walk. Yeah, just like Lord of the Rings stole the the theme from wrecking for a dream for the two towers trailer

42:11.400 --> 42:13.400
Yeah, that's true. That's kind of bizarre

42:13.720 --> 42:16.600
We'll see. I think I've been sorry, man. Just doing a double-end

42:19.120 --> 42:20.320
Anal

42:20.320 --> 42:21.960
Yeah, I

42:21.960 --> 42:27.160
Didn't actually know what record right? Like I knew a record Jim was I've heard of it

42:27.160 --> 42:32.120
But I'd never actually seen I didn't know that was the theme. So I thought it was badass if they had that in there

42:32.120 --> 42:33.240
Yeah

42:33.240 --> 42:34.880
Yeah

42:34.880 --> 42:39.620
Anyways, okay. So moving on Star Trek looks very promising

42:40.280 --> 42:43.560
That first is for wine. No, I don't you you

42:44.360 --> 42:50.120
Know I see in the theater. I said or what a lot of people think it's calm, but I don't think it's calm

42:50.120 --> 42:52.120
Okay. Okay. I didn't hear that

42:52.440 --> 42:54.240
There's a I don't think it is

42:54.240 --> 42:58.280
There's a character from the original series and you didn't hear this part because we're over using

42:58.960 --> 43:00.200
Something was psychic guy, right?

43:00.200 --> 43:04.160
There's a character from the original series and it was like a really a really well-made episode

43:04.400 --> 43:08.960
And it was this guy who was kind of introverted. He was like a circular officer. Mm-hmm

43:08.960 --> 43:12.080
He was a little bit introverted. He was kind of picked on he wasn't really treated that well by anybody

43:12.240 --> 43:13.720
But he was really smart

43:13.720 --> 43:19.000
And he had like Lee he had latent psychic powers that were brought out by some kind of

43:19.280 --> 43:23.720
Phenomenon that the the ship encountered you mean like John Travolta and phenomena

43:23.720 --> 43:25.720
Like

43:26.200 --> 43:27.760
He became

43:27.760 --> 43:29.760
basically all-powerful

43:29.840 --> 43:31.760
So he did change the world

43:31.760 --> 43:37.160
He was like wrecking the fucking ship and shit and like and then of course Kirk like beats the shit out of them because it's care

43:37.440 --> 43:41.800
But everyone is saying that the villain in this is this guy

43:43.560 --> 43:45.960
They're doing that story that's

43:46.560 --> 43:51.240
That makes sense. I mean, I'm not opposed to that though. We were like, I've never seen the original episode

43:51.280 --> 43:56.880
I'm actually tempted to go back and watch the original episode because there's a lot of Star Trek. I haven't seen more of a Star Wars guy

43:56.920 --> 44:01.380
So yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't be wrong. I mean I do like Star Trek to a degree

44:01.380 --> 44:05.480
I just haven't gotten into it as much so this should be educational for sure

44:06.200 --> 44:10.360
Really at the very least at the very least watching that one episode. Yeah

44:11.160 --> 44:17.320
We're just watching all a lot of people are saying on the internet that that that's also instead of it being conx

44:17.320 --> 44:20.560
He doesn't look like Connie's that he doesn't act like con. It's literally a regular, dude

44:20.560 --> 44:24.480
Yeah, and that's what this guy was. Well, he doesn't have the fake muscles, but it still could be him

44:26.120 --> 44:28.120
Ricardo Montalban

44:29.200 --> 44:34.600
You know, I don't know man Radley Con was a good fucking movie. I think he was kind of overrated to be honest

44:34.600 --> 44:39.740
Yeah, yeah same here. I really I really do. I I thought it was good, but I didn't think it was

44:40.400 --> 44:47.040
You know best movie ever good. I didn't think it was it wasn't even I don't even say it's my favorite of the entire series

44:47.040 --> 44:49.040
I have the Star Trek series. Yeah

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Favorite of all the

44:52.160 --> 44:53.720
first contact

44:53.720 --> 44:58.520
That was like that's kind of different cuz like now you're talking about next generation or generations

44:58.520 --> 45:04.740
I thought generations was very well done too. I don't agree with the first contact though. I didn't like generations at all. Really?

45:06.080 --> 45:11.220
Otherwise, I'd say see it for me. I didn't think the first one was that fantastic

45:12.360 --> 45:16.880
The original cast I think it's a toss-up between Wrath of Khan and the one with the whales

45:19.760 --> 45:25.220
And then I actually know maybe that one was my favorite for generation for next generation

45:25.220 --> 45:31.460
It's obviously going to be first. Yeah. Well, I need to be honest. I haven't even seen I mean ones after that

45:31.460 --> 45:39.060
I haven't seen insurrection or nemesis because I thought they looked stupid and they ended up being quite shit. Yeah in the last one

45:40.160 --> 45:46.140
Basically, they played war basically said yeah, we put like a dune buggy action scene in this cuz I like dune buggies

45:47.140 --> 45:49.540
He even said that like in the fucking interview for the movie

45:49.540 --> 45:52.540
Well, he did change his voice for that show. So I guess I had to give him that

45:57.340 --> 46:03.140
This is very distracting actually watching I'll play red facts in the background. What else what other chatter was that?

46:04.100 --> 46:06.100
Jacking the giant Slayer

46:06.300 --> 46:08.300
That looks like it

46:08.860 --> 46:12.980
That'd be like kind of thing. I'd bring my kid to if I had a kid. I don't have kids

46:13.960 --> 46:19.100
That seems like McDonald's toy pillar, yes, it feels like basically

46:20.780 --> 46:23.740
People are jumping on the Disney bandwagon like 20 years too late

46:23.780 --> 46:30.220
Yeah, and there's there's grabbing out every single old tale they can and trying to make an epic. Oh, yeah, because it's it's it's

46:31.340 --> 46:33.180
licensed right, yeah

46:33.180 --> 46:36.940
So there's like taking every old not even mythological

46:36.940 --> 46:41.780
There's a couple hundred years old story and you're just like let's make an epic fucking period piece out of this thing

46:41.780 --> 46:45.300
Yeah, let's let's like him go over his travels. We can't fuck that one at all

46:46.740 --> 46:53.460
Wait, are they actually others? They already made it man. It came out late 2005 or 2006 at Jack Black is Gulliver

46:53.940 --> 46:55.940
Where the fuck was I?

46:56.340 --> 46:58.340
Not watching it, obviously

46:58.820 --> 47:03.540
Netflix I watched it as Jason Segel doing possibly the worst English accent I've ever

47:04.500 --> 47:08.100
Mean like I could do a better English accent than that. He's like yours pretty good

47:08.700 --> 47:10.700
It

47:11.540 --> 47:18.740
Was it was fucking because go I love girls Travers go I love Gulliver's travel it is my of all classic literature

47:18.740 --> 47:21.220
I'd say it's my favorite book because

47:21.820 --> 47:23.820
It's just it's very it's very

47:25.020 --> 47:26.100
sarcastic

47:26.100 --> 47:28.100
tongue-in-cheek

47:28.140 --> 47:36.060
Just really really biting the satirical look on the society at the time and but it's got this whole fancy kind of element to it

47:36.060 --> 47:42.060
So if you haven't read it, I definitely recommend don't watch. Why are you recommending like a random book? No, you've related to Jack and the

47:43.620 --> 47:45.860
It gets in the literature anyway

47:47.380 --> 47:52.860
Nobody should make another travel movie ever again unless they know I'm decent. Yeah. Okay. Well Jack

47:52.860 --> 48:00.220
Yeah, Jack and the Beanstalk, of course, and apparently the guy played Hurley or you like voices a giant. I think I heard yeah

48:00.700 --> 48:06.300
I think I had heard that Jorge Garcia. I think he voices one of the one of the Giants in yeah

48:07.100 --> 48:12.380
Only good basically tell who it is to if it if it is him because he's got this massive fro

48:14.100 --> 48:16.300
Only point you actually see them in the trailer is him going

48:20.260 --> 48:25.500
Yeah, it might be good for a few laughs but I don't see it being it looks pretty vapid

48:26.140 --> 48:27.140
It's

48:27.140 --> 48:32.060
Isn't it vapid if you have kids it'll shut them up for like an hour then they'll get bored

48:32.460 --> 48:34.460
And then you'll never see the end. Yeah

48:34.700 --> 48:39.300
it looks like it's gonna end up being really similar to um, I

48:40.580 --> 48:46.420
Can see bombing like horribly the Red Riding Hood the Little Red Riding Hood. Yeah, I could hear you piece

48:46.420 --> 48:50.700
I mean, I could see that that was done destroying itself. Yeah

48:51.700 --> 48:53.500
Is that it?

48:53.500 --> 48:56.620
I feel there was fun. There is a Will Smith one. Oh

48:57.460 --> 48:59.500
Yeah, welcome to after earth. They're more

49:00.860 --> 49:04.860
Teaser trailer, right? So there's not much to say and Will Smith and his kid are

49:05.980 --> 49:10.500
Survivors of some kind of spaceship crash. You're right. I go with that at the very end of the trailer Will Smith

49:10.500 --> 49:12.500
It's like it's like this planet is

49:13.220 --> 49:15.220
And it's like well, yes

49:16.380 --> 49:19.220
It's earth obviously, I thought it was after earth

49:23.580 --> 49:25.580
For some reason all I could think of is after birth

49:30.460 --> 49:36.300
In after earth you can pick up after 8 instead of just a Christmas how you're thinking of this

49:40.300 --> 49:42.300
God

49:42.780 --> 49:49.280
Yeah, I don't I'm not attacking after birth I think it's kind of it's pretty funny how much

49:50.700 --> 49:52.700
How much?

49:52.900 --> 49:55.180
Jaden Smith looks like his old man now, but

49:55.980 --> 50:01.780
That's it. Was that kid who was within the same guy who did the karate kid? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I'm straight

50:01.780 --> 50:04.660
Well, the karate kid came out how many years ago? I

50:05.540 --> 50:10.500
Don't remember. It was 2008. I think so. Is that 2008 or 2009?

50:13.260 --> 50:14.860
Either way

50:14.860 --> 50:19.460
It's been at least two or three years since since he filmed so the kids grown up a lot

50:19.460 --> 50:24.620
So he looks like his old man. Anyways, uh, yeah, so all the lot I'd say the most

50:24.620 --> 50:29.580
I'd probably want to see Superman steel the most and for me it's Star Trek and Superman

50:29.980 --> 50:36.940
Yeah, Superman or just man of steel. Why is it Superman steel suddenly for us? It's man of steel. Yeah. Yeah, it's man of steel

50:36.940 --> 50:41.420
Yeah, I'd say man steel and then start right. I'd actually want to see Star Trek more. I like the last movie

50:41.420 --> 50:44.580
It was it was fantastic. It was really JJ Abrams

50:46.100 --> 50:48.620
Actually making something that made sense

50:49.620 --> 50:54.460
Wasn't just a bunch of loose ends. That was nice. Although that's also

50:55.580 --> 51:00.060
Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse too. I don't think Carlton Cuse did anything on

51:01.100 --> 51:03.100
the writing

51:03.220 --> 51:07.220
Well on lost. Yeah, but I mean it's the first Star Trek. Oh, well, no, I'm not talking about that

51:07.220 --> 51:09.920
I'm talking about lost. I think the first Star Trek was

51:10.540 --> 51:14.220
Damon Lindelof and JJ Abrams. Yeah, there was no Carlton Cuse involved

51:15.620 --> 51:19.060
Either way, it was it was tight made sense. That's the thing

51:19.460 --> 51:25.580
Okay. Anyways, that's that's it for trailer talk. Yeah. Yeah, I'm done. I'm totally done. Isn't there one more?

51:27.340 --> 51:32.580
You wrote something in your in your phone Oh warm body. Oh, yeah. Oh my god

51:35.380 --> 51:40.060
Okay, okay first off for anyone out there who hates Twilight

51:40.380 --> 51:44.820
You will hate this even more and I had never even heard of it until Devon. Devon even mentioned it

51:45.820 --> 51:47.820
That thing on your head

51:48.180 --> 51:53.660
Okay, so warm bodies is apparently the love story between a zombie and a human

51:54.460 --> 52:01.900
Zombie somehow sees this woman and his heart starts beating again and he regained some kind of

52:02.900 --> 52:04.900
some kind of consciousness some kind of

52:05.540 --> 52:07.820
Sense of morality. I don't know

52:07.820 --> 52:12.980
I get I'm guessing he still has the taste for human flesh and all that sort of thing because he'll always be haunted by his

52:13.180 --> 52:15.180
desire for

52:16.060 --> 52:18.380
You know for actually eating her

52:20.140 --> 52:25.660
She's gonna love that it's it's the stupidest looking movie yeah, it's

52:26.900 --> 52:32.060
Horrible, it's just absolutely atrocious. I only know I believe this shit will exist

52:32.060 --> 52:36.900
I can only hope that the riff tracks guys do a riff track. Oh, you know, they're going to so I can watch it

52:36.900 --> 52:38.580
Yeah, I'm not gonna watch it

52:39.180 --> 52:43.940
I've even finished watching the Twilight movies with riff tracks. I've been putting it off putting it off, but you know what?

52:43.940 --> 52:47.680
Yeah, I actually just watched them all of this before I before we went on brick

52:47.680 --> 52:52.200
Christmas break I just I basically I had like a bunch of work around the house to do

52:52.200 --> 52:56.520
Yeah, so I just put on my wireless headphones and I just listened to them for like

52:57.140 --> 53:02.740
Ten hours you listen to it. Just yeah, cuz I'm not gonna watch the fucking the going around those cleaning stuff

53:02.740 --> 53:06.740
Yeah, see that today like I'm thinking of actually sitting down and watching them

53:07.020 --> 53:09.020
Even though it doesn't make any sense

53:09.020 --> 53:13.900
I mean, I mean it doesn't make sense, but also make sense us to actually do what you're doing

53:13.900 --> 53:15.900
Yeah, that's actually a really good idea

53:17.620 --> 53:19.620
God

53:19.660 --> 53:21.660
Just filth. I mean

53:22.100 --> 53:24.740
They must know they're just like cashing in. Oh, yeah

53:25.740 --> 53:29.140
They have how could they not be cashing in?

53:29.140 --> 53:35.760
I mean, it's a love story between a supernatural creature and a human they were doing interviews on it

53:36.740 --> 53:41.580
Remember like the short little interview ets and like they're yeah, they're trying to talk about like with a straight face

53:42.940 --> 53:45.200
Yeah, they're actually that's the best acting

53:48.220 --> 53:51.820
Much better than the movie itself. Well, maybe the girl ended be in

53:52.940 --> 54:00.500
Better than and Bella's actress fuck. Yeah, she's pretty bland. I still can't believe she's gonna be an on the road

54:00.500 --> 54:06.500
She's basically the real-life Brock

54:13.260 --> 54:15.260
Yeah with warm bodies just

54:16.820 --> 54:22.900
Jesus Christ that yeah, yeah, I think that's pretty much it more bodies Jesus Christ

54:24.580 --> 54:28.340
You wanna go see are you saying that Jesus Christ is a zombie? Yes

54:30.740 --> 54:35.540
I'm gonna wait for it to come to the discount theater that way that we can go and we'll probably get the entire theater ourselves

54:35.540 --> 54:40.900
So we could sit there and like throw popcorn at the screen or like actually talk and actually talk

54:42.660 --> 54:45.700
Here's the thing if we can actually put theater to ourselves we could actually film ourselves

54:46.460 --> 54:52.760
Wow, that's not illegal. No film ourselves watching it and making fun of it. No actually filming the movie

54:53.940 --> 54:57.100
So stop by apathetic teenagers. I don't think they're gonna care

54:57.620 --> 55:01.300
Yeah, that's the great thing about the discount heater he wanted it's a discount

55:01.300 --> 55:05.180
Yeah, but also that because it's in like an area of town

55:05.180 --> 55:09.940
It's not quite as populated anymore. And you know that mall isn't quite get as much business

55:09.940 --> 55:13.980
Oh and like when when you actually would watch a movie there, it's usually pretty empty

55:14.220 --> 55:17.980
Yeah, I remember going there and just having like the entire place to yourself. Yeah

55:17.980 --> 55:24.900
I would see Ted and there was yeah, there was just there's a two of us of the just do how do they stay in business?

55:25.900 --> 55:27.900
Because some nights are better than others food

55:28.420 --> 55:33.580
Yeah on the food to always the food cheap. Oh god. Yeah. No, no, it's not cheap. Sorry to so bad

55:33.580 --> 55:36.820
It's like reasonable. It's not it's reader. Yeah, I mean, it's like half

55:36.820 --> 55:42.780
It's still highly half like Austin Silver City fuck or simplex or whatever and your your average movie theater. It's so

55:43.780 --> 55:46.260
That was like I don't go to movies that often

55:46.260 --> 55:51.940
So I find it really fucking ridiculous when I like I'm looking at the prices for food 12 bucks for a hot dog and nachos

55:52.100 --> 55:55.740
Oh my gosh, it was like fucking $8

55:59.420 --> 56:03.780
Yeah, yeah, it's five bucks yeah, I got I bought a large and I ended up paying like

56:05.060 --> 56:09.820
723 I think which sucks but at the same time there's a lot of food in a large bed

56:09.820 --> 56:15.260
Yeah, actually, that's that's pretty considerable. I mean, you'll get I think popcorn farts, but that's okay

56:17.180 --> 56:20.880
That's a risky take right high fiber content

56:22.140 --> 56:27.220
I eat high-fiber like normally though with with yeah, I know but it was like fake butter on it

56:27.820 --> 56:31.020
Yeah, that that's man horrible. Oh, man that big butter

56:31.980 --> 56:35.140
Like here's the thing at this theater

56:35.700 --> 56:38.820
You can like buy butter for like 20 cents or something to put on your popcorn, right?

56:38.820 --> 56:43.580
And then I said I didn't know you do or you do it for free because this stuff was like I didn't buy the butter

56:43.580 --> 56:47.020
But then they grape aside the interest of the theater. There is another station

56:47.020 --> 56:51.660
There's like a free there's like a free but I want you just do this and then and Dave's like wall because this better

56:52.020 --> 56:58.900
Try to I put it under and I press the button and what comes out is like apple juice. Yeah consistency of

56:59.540 --> 57:06.300
Incredibly melted butter. Yeah, it's like pure yellow waters like piss. Just that's basically yeah fucking essentially

57:06.300 --> 57:11.980
It's kind of tastes like it too. It just it didn't have a taste to it. It just basically moved up the popcorn

57:12.980 --> 57:17.900
Grease, it's extra grease on your popcorn. It's not even like your sock work wherever you want to insert it

57:18.060 --> 57:23.900
Just like pouring canola oil onto your popcorn essentially, yeah, that's our butter. It's kind of a little oil. Yeah

57:25.140 --> 57:32.420
Okay. Well, that's enough trailer talk. We've been getting incredibly off-base. So I'm gonna enter right here. Anyways, fuck

57:32.420 --> 57:38.940
I'm thanks for watching and I'm going what the fuck was that coming in your mouth? That was me saying have a good one

57:39.100 --> 57:41.100
What was the sound?

57:41.240 --> 57:43.240
What is that sound?

57:48.380 --> 57:50.380
You're adorable

57:52.340 --> 57:54.340
Oh, yeah
