0	6600	Hey guys, we just got back from watching The Hobbit. So I thought we'd just do a run through. We got some
7600	9600	AMW burgers
9760	15360	and tea. Should we break them out while we talk? Yeah, you know, it's kind of tradition for us to
16200	18720	Eat crappy food on camera. So
19720	21720	anyways
21720	28320	For those of you who don't really know me. I mean, if they didn't know you, why would they be here? That's true
29000	32840	Anyways, okay, what I'm trying to get at is that I
35960	37960	Have been a
38280	45040	Owls over there. He's playing Red Faction. Thank God I can talk. I was gonna say you can dish while you dish. Excellent!
46120	51780	Right anyways back on the topic. I have been an avid Lord of the Rings fan since I was about 15
51780	53780	Um
53820	56620	These new burgers what for me is actually pretty good
57140	64940	Let's review the burgers instead cuz they're pretty good. Well, I see there's like it's a burger with mayo and cheese and ketchup
69340	71340	Okay, so when I was 15
72140	76400	My my mom tried to get me to read her copy of The Hobbit which I have right here
77660	79740	As my mom's copy. It's missing the back cover
80740	82740	Wonderful and it was um
83540	84820	she
84820	87700	actually purchased a copy of the Sommarillion, which if
88460	93900	You don't know why the fuck would you ever read this? Sommarillion is the history book
94500	96500	it's like the Bible of
96980	100380	Middle Earth it has everything from the beginning or
100820	104420	So they say Eru the one the alluvatar God whatever in halls
104420	108640	I knew also known as well angels and they had this this
109320	116600	This holy symphony and you know, there's more goth or Melkor was like if you haven't noticed
116600	122160	Oh blah blah blah case. You haven't noticed Dave is the ultimate fucking Lord of the Rings nerd asshole
122160	126440	I'm really not and I just I just I that's what I remember though and me
126440	129240	I I don't really care one way either by the series
129240	134320	So we're just kind of I'm the average guy and you're the ultimate fan blood. Oh, so you've been third? Yeah, I did notice
134680	138540	You guys so you got two casuals and pretty much hard for
140600	145560	It was pretty easy to say I mean again I fell asleep during it is there anything less than casual
146480	151260	Apathetic. Oh, okay. So apathetic casual hardcore. We got three levels lethargic
155040	156800	Anyways
156800	161400	so I got pretty hardcore into Lord of the Rings from there I
162400	166920	Watched all I was actually the movie I watch it. What do the movie?
167280	169280	Well, I'm just giving a precursor
169440	176380	Precursors like here's Dave's life regarding Tolkien how much whatever I love. I love Tolkien's work. I love the Hobbit
176380	179360	I love Lord of the Rings. I mean, I've seen all the movies like a thousand times
179360	183560	I own this dick at least three, you know, I you went back in time
184640	186640	Wow, it must show me this
186920	188920	I
190960	194720	Loved the movie I thought was very well done. There are definitely some things that I
195680	197160	wasn't as
197160	199160	overjoyed about but
199200	200800	Here's the thing
200800	202800	they put elements of
203260	208480	something called the unfinished tales into this movie and the unfinished tale is essentially just a collection of
209400	211400	Exactly what it sounds like unfinished tales
211800	216300	That Tolkien wrote during between 1914 and
217160	219160	while basically up to his death and
219680	222240	He never really got them published, but they are all
223760	230280	Relevant to different ages in the Middle Earth universe and one of them is actually a tale of
231840	234320	The the expedition to Erebor
234760	240240	Told through Gandalf's eyes and he goes on a bit about this battle
240880	243560	between the dwarves and the orcs at Moria and
244200	247240	mentions I pretty damn sure he mentions a song and
248600	252240	It was really cool to see all this stuff. That was so originally
252880	259600	That hard that that that that big armless orc guy. Yeah, he wasn't in the Hobbit original. I
260400	264840	Don't think so, I think he was there don't read a book right now to try and find
266440	268400	Thinking he was
268400	272640	Somewhere in there. Maybe but there's so many there's so many characters
273360	276320	Yeah to remember that I mean
277400	283880	Like there this is only the first movie of three and I'll be wrong. They're like halfway through it. Here's here's the thing
284920	289280	This is this is the Hobbit book. Mm-hmm. This is about the same size
289920	296220	One of the three books that make it the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Yep, that trilogy got three movies
296680	299300	This book is getting three movies
300000	304880	That it this this movie is about an hour too long. I think
305720	308240	In our hours two hours too long
309360	311360	So you want you want like a one hour?
312400	315520	50 minute movie. It's like it's like an HBO show
316160	318080	Yeah
318080	322160	It's Game of Thrones watch Game of Thrones. I do have to admit that there were parts that dragged on
322720	327160	The beginning half-hour did think it takes a long time to get going. No, but that's the thing though
327160	329160	I thought it was awesome because
330040	333320	This is a general audience. You have to set up a history
334040	339480	There has to be something established there and I thought the fact that they're showing Erebor is showing the Dwarven Kingdom
340600	344960	They they show Dale they show everything, you know, they show the entire environment around there because
346320	351800	They're not gonna get there until the second movie. Yeah, so they want to show you know
352080	358920	It's not just it's not just a few scribbles on a map. It's a real place with you know, real real towns real people
359600	361920	It's very beautiful. It's very stark
361920	367240	I understand on that but I feel like they could have saved it until the beginning of the second movie to show us my
367240	373760	That it's just not really relevant right now. We're just like and also I also mean like the stuff that's happening with
374480	379100	Bilbo hanging out in his house and they got like all the kind of what's proto. Oh, no
379100	382400	No, well partially that that went a little bit too long
382400	386240	You just had you know Elijah would show up for like a five-second cameo in it
386240	389920	Well, I thought it was and then he's always going they actually have
390640	394680	Even a prologue a prologue to the prologue. Yeah
395280	401040	In Lord of the Rings, it was really weird. I mean it's cool and it kind of like a slice of white
402040	404040	Slice of life
404040	405200	style
405200	407300	Slice of white slice it your way
408360	410800	Yeah, slice of lifestyle. I thought it was kind of cool
412400	420200	They're just kind of padding it's like padding. Oh here here is my I think my biggest personal problem with this movie
420200	425120	Mm-hmm. It was still an alright movie. I'd still definitely recommend people watch it, but
425960	427760	They're taking
427760	432220	They're going out of their way too much to try and link it back to the original three movies
432680	437960	Yeah, like like Frodo shows up for like 20 minutes at the start of the movie and he kind of overstays as welcome
437960	439960	then like later on it has
440320	445680	Gandalf's hanging out with another wizard guy in the two elves. I saw him on and glad you're all yeah
446680	448680	They're all just talking about like
450000	452000	Well, that's the thing though
452280	457200	There is some kind of council. There's something that goes on believe they actually talk about this necromancer
457200	460720	Yeah, it's only mentioned in the books though. They don't go into detail
460720	467540	Here's my movie the necromancer scene was basically just them trying to talk about you think hook it to the to the three
467960	470160	Movies a little bit more and it has nothing to do with this story
470160	474240	If you cut that scene out this movie would be the exact same. It would not lose anything
474240	479340	Well, they have they should at least mention this the necromancer because they do in the book
479840	486800	It's very really if everything that happens to Gandalf. He just explains it. He says oh I ran into Radagast
487320	490480	And he told me about the necromancer and dull Golder. That's it
491240	493240	Like they don't actually really show Radagast
493680	495720	They don't go on about although
495720	501200	I love the fact that he says the there's he says like there's the five wizards and he says the two was blue wizards
501200	503200	like I don't remember their names because
503440	506720	They don't they don't give the names like I think they give
508020	510440	Elvish names or something that they don't give any human names to them
510560	516760	Yeah, they have the original because the Wizards are actually my are they're all the spirits from the basically from heaven
518160	523520	They're like miners. They're like minor spirits. I got there turned into old men and I know
525080	529420	But I love it. Yeah, and they have a lot of in jokes that really really
529960	533560	Hardcore fan that was kind of funny. How did you just like? Oh, yeah
534840	540080	There's these these two blue guys, and I don't know I don't remember their name
540080	542840	I like how the brown wizard was covered in shit. Yeah
543840	547880	See you make the shit roll down Radagast. Yeah, Radagast was kind of a joke
548400	555480	Don't get me wrong. And he had like a bobsled with like rabbits. Was that from the book too? No
557160	558200	No
558200	564560	No, it was not. I saw it with my mom. She loved that. Wait, where did Radagast go even? I don't even remember him leaving the movie
564840	571320	What happened to him? I remember he was um, he was trying to bait the the war riders. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah
571360	575060	Well, he's least well, yeah, he fucked off because he saw that they were
575840	580220	So they were going after the others and he couldn't get their attention anymore. So I was like, oh shit
580220	584000	I'm just gonna get the hell out of here. I guess let's go home and forget the quest. What an asshole
584840	586600	Like he could fight
586600	589160	He's a proud wizard. What's he gonna do play the brown note?
590440	591880	weird
591880	596920	It's said that Radagast becomes more and more animalistic as years go on. Yeah
597600	601440	Yeah, I don't know if he I don't I don't think he ever actually
603040	606600	Goes because on the end of the Lord of the Rings I actually like they go off to the West or whatever
607440	609320	Right. I don't think it Radagast ever leaves middle
609320	613000	I think he just becomes more and more wild as the years go on more and more crazy
613560	620080	Cuz like Saruman even says that guy he eats too many mushrooms and they add all his brains and they make his teeth yellow
620080	622680	It's like pretty obvious. What kind of mushrooms he's eating
622680	626240	But no, it was a pretty good movie
626360	632120	but my only my only real problems that they seem to shoehorn scenes in to try and link it back to the
632640	637160	The Lord of the Rings trilogy movies that didn't really seem to belong there
637160	642320	Like yeah, if you usually if you're making a movie out of a book you don't
643240	648780	You don't like add things to the book you cut things from the book and I think the mention
648780	651720	They did that Lord of the Rings too though, but like if they were going to
652400	657720	Cut anything from this movie and make it not, you know an ass-numbing three hours of a movie
658920	663120	The first thing to cut would be all the references to the original
664120	667520	Get the necromancy stuff out of there because the movie wouldn't suffer for it
667600	675160	The movie is about the you know, the 13 dwarves hanging out and then fighting but it's it's it's an overarching story though
675640	678000	It's an overarching story connects the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings
678000	683160	It's part of it's part of the overarching story of even just Middle Earth in general
683600	690800	Sauron was the second command of like the of the devil. He is like the devil's right-hand man. He's bail
690800	692800	He's Mephistopheles. He's whatever he's whatever
694440	698400	Everything you're saying but in terms of this movie as
698880	702560	A single day could have just a referenced him and that's it
702560	707260	It didn't need to be they didn't have to didn't have to go to such detail about about the fucking
707720	712240	Fortress then have to go in such detail about about this necromancer
712880	717880	And show him they didn't have to you know, show the the witch kings dagger and all
717880	723400	I mean, I don't remember that that that that doesn't work that that doesn't seem right to me
724200	728640	And don't get me wrong. I mean, well, let's talk about the things we liked about it now. Oh
729480	731120	I
731120	735560	Mean the setting was the exact, you know, the setting for all the same was really nice to see the old
736440	738960	settings from that they were using Lord of the Rings
739480	747200	Rivendell and in the river Brunin and the trolls the trolls were awesome. Yeah, they're hilarious. Oh, man
747200	750160	Okay, I actually wanted to lean over and whisper this to you
750800	752800	India I
752920	758560	Wanted to lean over a student theater context. Yeah, I wanted to lean over and whisper this student theater
758560	765520	but it's like the scene kept going really quickly, so I just didn't but when when you see Galadriel for the first time and
766360	770360	Like she's staying there. She's like that long long ass gala kind of flowers out onto the floor
770360	775440	Yeah, and then like she rotates in place rather than just stepping she rotates in place
775440	779380	You could turn I think and I could down like twists up her as she just turns out. It's like hey guys
779380	781520	I was thinking she was on one of those
781520	787180	Um, oh like a turntable those shitty ad machines like you sound like you just like move your hips and you swing back
789280	792060	I was like that's the first thing comes in your mind
798800	800800	There were a lot of
800880	806120	Moments in this in this movie that were goofy and we're forgivable because it's a fantasy movie
806120	811220	Well, because it's like it's a it's a children's book. Yeah, it's well it was marketed as a children's book
811320	816640	Yeah, don't get me wrong. They made it a lot darker. Yeah a lot darker. I mean
817600	819840	They even right from the beginning I mean
820840	824440	We're showing up and I think they wanted to keep the same audience in the same
824600	829460	Yeah to say the same tone as the original three movie, but they were all singing. They kept the singing in
829460	832680	Yeah, that's kind of good. It wasn't. Oh, but it wasn't it wasn't like all
834200	839920	Ponce here like that. It wasn't quite I know there. There are some ponds to like that first song where they're singing
839920	842140	Yeah, well cracking the plates and all that. Yeah
842940	848540	That's just a thing though, they they gotta keep stuff like that in because it it's part of what made
849180	853340	It added that that or of whimsy to the original book
853340	859620	Yeah, so I mean they took they took so much out of Lord of the Rings. That was that was whimsical
859620	862020	There was a there was a lot of singing there was a lot of
862540	863860	light hard
863860	868380	Somewhat light harness to the elves themselves, but more in the Hobbit
868620	874220	They are they're like they're actually a bunch of well trolls and I'm talking internet trolls
875620	881120	Joking around with people they like fucking with people's minds. Oh, here's a fucking thing. What's the book? Sorry?
882140	884460	Here's the thing. I remember the
885020	890740	big thing about Lord of the Rings is how come Gandalf didn't get those fucking birds and like fly fly the fucking ring over and
890740	894540	Everyone who says that everyone who replies that says well Gandalf didn't have the birds yet
894540	899620	Yeah, and like by the time the end of the third fucking movie comes around he has the birds to use it's like, okay
899620	904240	Fine in this movie. He uses the birds. No, the birds are there and this is before the first
905060	911900	I could have sworn he uses that boss an asshole. Yeah. Yes. Um, it's up to the birds to decide but okay
912060	914760	If he they just get dumped off like that
915380	921900	It takes away all these all these events. I mean the whole point of these stories. It's not okay. It's a story
922740	924740	Development at the same time
924900	930100	In the context of the people living in that world. Why wouldn't they oh, I know I know
930100	936900	I know under the context of the in the in-world process. It would make so much more sense just to get a lift
936900	938900	I mean, what would you rather walk?
939580	942560	We're gonna ride. So I've heard some people say that like
943820	948020	Sirens tower there how they can have like a laser eye beam coming to the eye that would like shoot the Eagles maybe
948500	952660	But I'm not sure if that's actually a thing. Well, yeah, why won't you knock it off?
954220	960660	If that's the case then why wouldn't the I be shooting lasers at the army from from Gondor
962180	966900	No, I think people are just being idiots I mean seriously laser I also know
968140	974620	The the undead human kings there who had like those 13 other rings. Yeah, they had like they were riding dragons, right?
975060	979380	They're right dragon that's cool. Yeah. Yeah. So like I guess they could like done like
980100	982100	Air support type thing
982260	987900	Against against the Eagles. I don't why wasn't it like an aerial battle in Lord of the Rings like Eagles vs. Dragons, man
988660	993900	Or sure, they did attack them at the end. Yeah, it was like like a two-second scene
993900	998840	Yeah, that should have been like the main focus of the entire fucking war was like the aerial battle
999340	1001340	This isn't World War one
1001940	1003540	dog fights
1003540	1010380	The whole point of this you've gotten away the fuck off track. Yeah, you're going on these tangents about about things that
1011100	1013720	Okay. Yeah, I mean you're the English guy
1015620	1017620	Here's here's the thing is that
1018200	1021660	One thing that I mean it didn't ruin the movie for me
1021660	1026620	But I did wonder this constantly throughout the movie is how come some of the dwarves?
1026980	1031460	Had like the big beards the big noses the big hands and arms
1031700	1036180	They had like the dwarven body and some of them were just like tiny humans. Yeah. Yeah
1037220	1041700	Billy Kelly Thorin they just didn't put the makeup on those guys. I wonder why they didn't do that
1042260	1047140	Are they actually they're actually different types of dwarf that are just like less nosy. No
1047420	1051680	Well, there are I think there are different types of dwarves but these but these guys are all Arab war doors
1051680	1056560	They're all they're all from the same place. Yes, but at the same time
1057440	1060400	Maybe you just wanted some of the doors to look goofy and something to look serious
1062520	1067920	I think there's like the guy there's the one guy who had just the beard not the the mustache
1067920	1073580	He was like a younger guy with the like the ginger beard. I think they're trying to make him look younger and kind of dopey
1074280	1080260	Philly and Kelly, you know Thorin's these are actually thorns cut first cousins. Yeah, that's why they're there
1080260	1082400	They're so they're so tight with them. Yeah
1082960	1088280	They are they are very young by dwarven standards that I and that's that's why they make them
1088360	1092080	They're their beards are much shorter that sort of thing. Yeah, I'm Thorin
1092080	1095680	I think they just wanted to give them more of a sense of nobility. I
1096080	1100640	Feel like they just wanted to at least put a couple of hot toddies
1100640	1107000	Yeah, pretty much good-looking male actors into the movie just they all weren't because Martin Freeman's kind of like just mr. Average
1107840	1112360	I think they just they they just wanted to put in a couple of decent looking
1112760	1117240	Human looking actors and have it the right instead of like having an entire cast like an old man
1117240	1119440	And like a bunch of midgets with like big noses
1120040	1126200	You know, they actually wanted to make someone look half half human creams machines old man
1126200	1128200	That's some some midgets. Yeah
1129960	1131960	Old man the midget source
1133120	1134520	Well
1134520	1136840	Yeah, I also I'm disappointed that
1138200	1140200	We didn't get to the dragon this time
1141160	1142480	That it's build up
1142480	1145840	I know but like they but you can't spend a full movie on Bill
1145840	1150200	I think if you build up for the first third of a movie they can't show them at all
1150320	1155520	But they should have like they spend this entire time talking about the dragon as being the biggest threat and it doesn't show up
1156680	1160120	Until the very end where it like blinks out of the gold pot. I was like, yeah
1160720	1167160	As soon as I saw the dragon slowly it's a hook as soon as I saw the dragon slowly emerge from the pile of gold
1167160	1169880	I was like this movie's ending on his eye
1170440	1172440	Probably opening up into it
1172960	1179120	It did yeah. Yeah, there was some predictability there. Yeah, it's it's unfortunate
1181200	1183200	Why do dragons that go
1183200	1188720	What's the deal with that? Uh, they're just wicked cruel greedy, but they can't spend it. They don't they don't care
1189600	1195560	That's the whole thing it's like a crow they just grab shiny things a lot of ancient mythology, you know
1195560	1197560	He's drawing ancient mythology, right?
1197600	1200160	Why are you question? You know, I read way more
1201240	1205520	Mythological because this he's a literature that I have so basically
1206400	1208400	Because I like things to be explained
1210240	1217480	Okay, okay here here's something that you may not have learned right by now is not everything spoon-fed
1218720	1221880	You have to sometimes it takes learning things on your own
1223040	1225360	I'm not doing homework to go to a fucking movie
1228120	1231440	Or or or okay, sometimes just take things as I are
1232280	1238240	Not question that shit out of them. No, no, that's what we do. That's what we do here on the site
1241760	1244800	That's what I've been doing all this time, yep, okay
1245360	1247600	No, it was it was a good movie I liked it
1247600	1253080	I was uh, you know, they all all my nitpicks are just nitpicks and it was overall pretty good. No, I
1253960	1255960	For the most part. I agree
1256680	1262240	The actor plays Gandalf looks significantly older this time though, sir. You become yeah, he's ten years older. Yeah
1262480	1266080	Yeah, that's one thing I didn't worry. He's supposed to be younger, but he looks older. Yeah
1266600	1269920	Well, that is the thing. Yeah, that is a thing with it. Well, yeah
1270360	1276000	That's one of those things that you just sometimes can't get around with all the makeup in the world don't necessarily get around it
1276000	1278000	Yeah, it's just one of those things
1278440	1283120	Especially if he's got any allergy to the makeup, you know, yeah, it's gonna screw him up
1283120	1287480	And you think guys are old like I mean, he's got to be he's got to be about 80 by now
1287760	1292440	But is he Christopher Lee's got to be older than that even Christopher Christopher Lee is like 88
1292440	1295240	I swear to God and he's like hand this movie to you for a little bit
1295240	1301000	Yeah, I think I see is always only show up in the book too. Yeah, I think I'm pretty sure he did
1301000	1303160	It's really was in the book. Yes, Chris
1304640	1306640	Yes, Christopher Lee as
1307120	1312680	Christopher Lee as the necromancer. He actually turns out to be Dracula to show up in the book. It's actually a hammer film
1313240	1319040	You know, it's it's it's it's a it's a huge tribute to hammer films. They're just gonna have you know
1319560	1321560	Gandalf be a a
1322680	1324680	Vampire Slayer
1326240	1328240	God
1329400	1331200	What's wrong with me
1331200	1332760	anyways
1332760	1338360	For anyone who is a hardcore fan hasn't seen it. Why haven't you seen it yet? Why the hell happens?
1338360	1340360	Like we had a good excuse
1340520	1345720	We're we're in our home. Yeah, we're in our hometown for Christmas. Yeah, there's no theater there
1345720	1350720	So you so guys they're useful. Yeah, it closed 17 years ago then it became a strip club
1350720	1352720	then we came to strip club and now it is a
1352720	1359400	Education center slash temp agency is it not and it's also like a
1360160	1363840	Don't know. Oh, yeah. It's a cry dojo. Yeah, forget that. Yeah
1367240	1371560	Anyways, yeah, so for hardcore fans definitely definitely a must-see
1371880	1375200	There's a lot of things that I get thrown in there. I
1375760	1381480	Probably didn't even recognize half of them because I mean it's been a while. I haven't read Unfinished Tales in like five years
1381920	1383080	I
1383080	1385080	Hadn't read the Hobbit in a few years either
1385120	1389080	So there's all you know, this is one of those things one of the movies definitely
1389080	1395000	I definitely recommend watching more than once just to catch it all def is this you just to catch all of the
1395600	1402360	All these little things they add in it's it's amazing how much you want to see it already in 2d in 1d or?
1402920	1406160	Or an avx because we only watch the 3d we didn't watch the avx one
1406160	1409640	So I actually do want to see the avx one the hyper real version
1410640	1412640	3d wasn't really
1413200	1419680	That good. No, it wasn't the 3d 3d was it was very lackluster. I thought that I mean, I don't I know
1419680	1421360	I got I don't know if you guys do this
1421360	1425080	But like sometimes during a 3d movie I like take off the glasses and see if there's any difference everyone
1425400	1430080	There's there's barely any yeah, it's ridiculous. I mean during during like the
1432800	1434840	Every single action set piece
1435480	1441280	Yeah, there was always like there's like there's like rocks flying at the camera from like a sword impact in the ground
1441280	1443960	And there was like a piece of wood flake. There's always stuff. Yeah
1444720	1451040	You see you see some 3d there, but like rest of the movies just flat. Yeah, it's pretty it's pretty flat
1451040	1455060	I mean if I was gonna watch this, I just watch some blu-ray when they watch
1456480	1461400	TV or anything like that. I wouldn't bother it. I have a 3d TV. So that's easy. Well, I know exactly
1462400	1464400	Just makes things easier for everyone
1464720	1469020	Yeah, I really um, I wonder what the the extended edition of this movie is gonna be like
1470120	1477360	16 hours some of the dramatic pauses just I can't wait hours. This is the guy who watched like
1478520	1480960	Every not only to watch all the extended editions
1480960	1484380	But I watched I made sure every thing cuz I would get two thousand one thousand two
1484680	1490440	2003 they do have the extensions coming out and I'd sit there and I'd watch all the special features like back to back to back
1490960	1497420	You're fucking loser. I was I was a nice kid. I had almost free time. I had nothing else to do
1497420	1499720	So I was like fuck and I'm just gonna watch all the special feature stuff
1499720	1504200	And then I saw there's this guy there who's like a elvish language expert and he's in more
1504200	1508400	But he's like the geekiest guy I've ever seen my ladies. This guy is single
1512280	1515280	Anyways, yeah, it's an alright movie
1515280	1517080	I
1517080	1522200	Is definitely more just alright, I feel like it is an average movie that most people will enjoy
1522200	1527120	Um, but you know, we're gonna touch on something was major to like it's the Gollum scene
1527920	1530800	Well, we're not too long to that. Yes, I agree
1530800	1536800	I think went on too long what I really hope they would have done instead and I know it's because they've already established
1536800	1543780	Gollum is a is a character because this is a prequel it's coming out after yeah after Lord of the Rings if they showed him
1543780	1545180	less debilitated
1545180	1547260	If they hadn't really shown him at all
1547260	1552080	They've just shown him it look the only times that I really got the creeps was when they showed him up in the background
1552460	1558740	And with his eyes shining like that because in the book in the book, they established Gollum very very well
1558740	1561200	It's very very creepy. There's this vibe
1561900	1568420	The way that we okay describes Gollum. He's just this little this slide questions in the book with the riddles. Yes
1568420	1573220	Yes, they do that. I love I love the fact they kept that in they kept that the whole context in there
1573260	1575180	Is it in the book?
1575180	1581700	It's like they don't really show him. I mean, yes as a book the way it's described it, you know in the movie
1581700	1587300	I would just barely show him. I just show the eyes. I wouldn't have him actually, you know grappling with them or anything like that
1588660	1590660	um
1590660	1597020	It just it felt like they're they're more or less just showcasing the technology like oh look what we can do now
1597020	1599160	It's ten years later. He looks so much better. Yeah
1599800	1605360	Yes, we're aware the technology is advanced that much you don't have to show it in the terms of just
1605880	1608760	In just terms of build-up, it would have been all show up later
1609640	1615560	In the rest of the book. No, so he won't be in like a movie two and three unless they just do something stupid
1615760	1621600	Yeah, that's exactly it. He'll just show up the background. No, yeah. Hi guys. He doesn't this is this is it
1621600	1623600	Like this is how he gets the ring
1623960	1628640	Gollum he sees Gollum. He's about to you know, he's about to kill him or whatever and you know
1628640	1633000	He feels sorry for him and you know what when I saw that that I actually got him up my throat
1633560	1636300	When I'm gone, but like this the single tear and all that
1636800	1639480	Um, he just looks so pitiful. He really does
1639480	1644240	He looks like the saddest motherfucker of all time. Like he just lost his entire family because that's all he has
1644360	1648600	This is like a Native American looking out at his wasteland of a country
1649360	1651360	as like single to
1654520	1656520	There's
1660240	1667360	Just walking through the waters are eating and just eating McDonald's and throwing shit all over the reading a W and throwing
1672960	1679040	No, no, he just he seemed he's just seems so pathetic and I felt I felt really bad for the character the kinship
1679400	1682260	Well, he's he's an it's it's now a game ship
1683920	1685920	Between you and him. Yeah, sure
1686680	1688680	He's more like an act full of drug addicts
1688680	1694000	This is exactly what it's supposed to be is he's addicted to the power that that the ring gives them
1694600	1696600	and it's all he knows and
1697200	1704000	Once he realizes it's gone from that. He may not ever get it back. He he's a you know, he becomes what?
1704520	1707160	He really is just a crushed old hobbit
1707200	1713320	That's all he is just an empty shell of a hobbit or whatever the hell he has like close to
1713760	1716920	So from here on Bilbo just basically keeps the ring in his pocket
1716920	1720120	He gets home and keeps in his trunk and then like yeah for like the next 60 years
1720120	1724600	No ill effects despite like it just fucks up everybody else. Uh, what are you talking about?
1724600	1730680	Well, no, there's no ill effects per se other than a game. He becomes addicted to it and it gave me a screamer face
1733400	1735400	Yeah, and
1735960	1738320	You know and kept him looking young of course
1738320	1743480	he's very he looks basically the same the thing is like I can understand why they get a
1743600	1750000	Younger guy to play him because I mean Ian home is he's no spring-chicken either. He's got to be about 70 by now
1750000	1753120	I mean like all the shit that they make him. Oh, that's okay. Um
1754200	1759000	They fall so far in this movie everyone falls like oh all the time
1759000	1763080	It's true. They're in the this cave with all these goblins and shit and they fall like
1763560	1767640	500 feet and none of them are injured like maybe bruised
1768480	1773240	But no eternal Henry like I don't see anyone spitting up blood. I don't see any broken bones
1773240	1777600	I don't you know, I don't see any cuts any lacerations or was it?
1778720	1780720	lacerations
1781960	1785560	There's three of them lacerations evisceration eviscerations in
1786600	1788440	Incineration. Yeah
1788440	1791800	Yeah, there's there are none of those things when when they fall
1791800	1797900	Well, I mean obviously like the incineration isn't relevant, but the other two they fall so fucking much
1798640	1806880	Nobody ever gets like super injured just scrapes and bruises. It's like that that doesn't seem right. I know dwarves are hardy, but
1807640	1809640	It doesn't seem very also
1810000	1815200	like it must have happened at least three times in this movie where like Gandalf fucks off and
1815400	1819760	Like in the moment, they've been like the party gets in trouble and get over. Yeah, that's how I did
1819760	1821920	Yeah, that happens. I'm back guys. It just kills him
1821920	1827700	That's how it happens in the book because in the book Gandalf is supposed to have an air of mystery to him
1827920	1829320	He's an enigma
1829320	1832520	You know, they make him seem a little bit more human in the movie
1832520	1837440	They really do because they show what he does but in the book, it's just like he'll he'll come back, you know
1837440	1842880	He'll shit. He'll save their ass and then he'll kind of give a somewhat vague answer or you know, like
1842880	1844520	Maybe
1844520	1849800	One or two occasions. He'll actually explain what he was doing, but that's it. It's just an explanation
1850360	1855300	It's not actually showing him going to you know, they'll go there and blah blah blah
1855960	1857960	Yeah, yeah
1858000	1862720	You tried to end this thing now for like three three times and David, you know, I was like, oh I remember something else
1862720	1868840	I know there's so there are so many things to discuss about it. Well, I mean, that's just like the movie itself
1868840	1870840	They keep on trying to end it
1873200	1874400	And
1874400	1878720	Personally, I'm I'm not offended by it. I didn't at no point did I feel bored
1879680	1885760	Actually, you know what? Technically this movie is not called The Hobbit. It's called an unexpected. Well, it's The Hobbit
1886440	1889720	colon unexpected journey, but you didn't see the words The Hobbit weren't in the movie
1891960	1896440	When you finally see the opening title card of the movie it just says an unexpected journey actually
1896440	1899920	Yeah, they should have just said The Hobbit because it's in the Lord of the Rings. It started off Lord of the Rings
1900760	1904760	And then you know Lord of the Rings and then Fellowship of the Rings but like Lord of the Rings
1904760	1908840	I mean they started off a little because it's it's it's technically one book
1909400	1911400	Yeah, yeah
1912680	1914680	PJ you're
1915400	1917400	Kind of you're kind of hit or miss everybody
1917680	1922680	Fuck Oh Peter Jackson. Gotcha. It's you know what? I think it is losing all that weight
1922680	1930400	He lost all the weight in his brain. No, I'm just fucking no no I
1931600	1936760	Yeah, I really I really thought it was well done, you know, everything every movie has its warts
1936760	1942280	So I you know, I'm not gonna give it like a numerical value like that because really yeah
1942280	1946680	I don't see much point if you're if you don't like fantasy this won't convert you
1947240	1951680	If you're not a big Lord of the Rings fan, but you just want to watch something just just to watch it
1951680	1954000	This will entertain you for a while, but then you'll forget about it
1954240	1957920	It's really only gonna be memorable to see you care in the first place. I
1958960	1963680	Think and yet it's the highest grossing movie of the year. It's one of the highest
1963680	1969120	It's possibly the highest grossing movie of all time. So I don't think you're on the button there, man
1969120	1973880	I really don't because if it made that much money, that means people are going back from multiple viewings
1974720	1981020	Multiple which means it must be good enough for a lot of people or that people are just becoming more more
1981660	1983660	Fantasy, I think that's an ad. Yes
1987060	1991060	For sure, but no if this is a movie that you don't like this won't change your mind
1991060	1996860	But about me if you don't like fantasy, this isn't gonna make you love something about fantasy. This is not a gateway movie
2002220	2007720	Yeah, oh god now if you actually want to get into fantasy I'd suggest watching the Brit
2007720	2009720	Mmm
2010240	2012240	Fuck yeah
2013440	2018120	Yeah, it's a hands-on approach really really wet to all the ideas
2019560	2022080	If you want to get into fantasy watch willow
2024200	2026000	Oh
2026000	2031680	My watch labyrinth. All right, we've got that's a wrong fantasy
2031680	2033680	Oh
2033960	2035960	That's the kind of fantasy if you want like, you know
2038880	2042880	With his bulge with this bulge. Oh, yeah, cuz he reminds me of the babe
2046040	2048040	So say what babe oh no
2048640	2053880	That one's completely over my head and what babe the baby the power what power the power of voodoo who do you know?
2053880	2055560	Okay. Anyways, whatever
2055560	2059680	This has become completely irreverent completely irrelevant. Anyway
2060680	2064120	Anyways, definitely two thumbs up for me
2065240	2070500	Okay, that is a numerical thing. Yeah, it's two. Oh, no. I just ripped off Cisco neighbor
2072680	2074560	Definitely definitely
2074560	2079960	Very very high recommendation from me as a hardcore fan it it really does appeal
2080120	2085720	This is this is not the fifth time you've said it's because it's true and to the casual person
2085760	2089480	I still recommend it because it is a blockbuster. It does have a lot of
2090440	2092440	you know great effects and
2093160	2095160	incredible environments
2095600	2096960	very
2096960	2100920	You know wonderful music the score is is pretty much impeccable
2100920	2104200	They tied a lot of Lord of the Rings themes in there because a lot of the characters
2104840	2110400	No, but like some of the characters are still there. So they keep their themes and I thought it flowed very nicely
2112000	2115320	So yeah overall it was it was very good
2115720	2120820	Anyways, I look back in a bit and talk about the trailers that came before the movie
2123520	2124760	Wow
2124760	2128920	That is opposed to the ones after them. So the trailer is gonna be talking about the trailer. Yes
2129200	2131980	Okay. Okay. We're back in a bit to actually talk about the trailers
2136000	2142280	Okay, the trailers what shows you even get we got man of steel we got
2145720	2147720	a
2149080	2153360	Side red faction really fucked up. Yeah, I was just kind of
2154400	2158360	Jumping humping the ground even though he was like buried in the ground. Okay, whatever
2159320	2161320	Yeah, we got man of steel
2163760	2168080	You got Will Smith's vehicle for his child, yeah after earth
2168080	2170080	Yeah
2170840	2176380	See Al gone I said I said welcome to earth to Daphne he didn't get it. I was like you fucking suck
2179120	2185640	Yeah, yeah, I have to giant killer that's it and of course it is a good date a good day to die hard
2185840	2189800	Yeah, I didn't get that wasn't there? No, no. Okay. Well, I saw it
2190440	2196040	What else was there Star Trek? Oh, it's our truck. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's a lot of jumping off buildings
2196040	2201720	Yeah, times a job, but I feel like a lot a lot of breaking the only thing I have to say about just trailers nowadays
2201720	2203720	in general is
2205800	2207800	Wow
2208120	2213160	That's that is what every soundtrack for every trailer is now it's like
2217640	2219840	It's yeah something and then cuts a black
2219840	2221840	Wow
2222520	2226760	It really is like they sample two seconds from a dubstep song
2229280	2235040	I was like once the movie to start Gandalf would be like, yeah, there's that rat a guy's guy
2239640	2245120	Actually if they just did they showed one one little blip of him that would be fucking creepy
2245960	2251400	This old man in a brown just brown robes with shit all over his face
2253560	2257560	He's looking like this when he knows there's like dark magic food he's like
2258720	2263880	It was like the you know, the the dramatic chipmunk or direct school or whatever the hell it is. Yeah
2265360	2270000	Yeah, like that shit all over space that's exactly what it looks like
2271400	2274080	You got to poop on I gotta say
2275120	2279520	I don't know you you really you really impressed with the die-hard one
2279520	2286340	I I've only seen the first one so I can't really say. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I like I like yeah, I had movies
2286340	2288520	They're pretty cool. They're the best Christmas movies
2290360	2293800	Like this, you know, I like to say Bad Santa's one of the best ones yeah
2295800	2299160	How many times is Alan Rickman fall out of a window in Bad Santa
2300160	2302160	a lot
2302280	2304280	Well, there's the deleted scenes
2307680	2313760	But actually he goes he goes into the set of every Christmas movie ever made since Die Hard and he insists on being dropped
2313760	2315760	out of the window
2321760	2323760	Harry Marvin
2325480	2327480	I think
2329160	2331160	Oh
2332640	2334640	Okay, yeah, so
2336080	2339840	Die hard looked look like a good trailer, but I mean, you know
2340360	2344000	Like you don't need a trailer for Die Hard. You know what it is. Yeah, it's Die Hard
2344000	2350760	It's it's John McClane going out and getting shot at and falling and falling really far and apparently not dying
2351560	2353560	Having a foot meter. Yes
2354320	2360280	Wait, you'll get that one. No, you know diehard NES game. Oh fuck. Oh god
2362240	2365960	Okay, that's why I probably stabbed some part of my brain after I saw that
2367600	2373200	Partial lobotomy what else we had then Man of Steel came up that looks at that, you know, I'm excited
2373200	2375960	I mean, I like there was no wow
2376360	2379040	Yeah, there's no walk to it and you know
2379040	2385040	I love this the setup him walking around in the Arctic. They don't show the fortress of solitude, but that's okay
2385560	2392640	It's like I love the fact it's Kevin. It's Kevin Costner playing. It's playing. It's dad adopted dad
2393400	2395920	Well, I don't know who plays his mom, but that's okay
2396600	2402400	I mean, he's like sure the villain in the trailer if you noticed that yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah
2402400	2406760	I don't I don't really know who it is. I don't recognize general Zod. Yeah, Neil before Zod
2409080	2415440	Okay, nevermind it just it's I guess it's on I remember for the longest time the reason why they didn't want to
2415920	2418240	Make make any more Superman movies after
2419120	2421120	the sixth room Christopher Reeve Oh
2421680	2428880	Had done his bit is because they couldn't find good villains to go up against Superman. You know, yeah
2428880	2431280	Cuz I don't but Kevin Spacey
2432040	2436080	Like with Batman you have the Joker. He has his
2436080	2442280	Easy intent this is right there his his really famous arch-nemesis that always gives him a run for his money. Yeah
2443480	2450440	With Superman, there's not really anybody like that Lex Luthor. Yeah, but he's not quite filmable Lex Luthor
2450840	2452560	Brainiac Zod
2452560	2456360	It's really just Zod. I do today in terms of
2457880	2462080	In terms of making it work for a film it really is just general Zod
2463960	2465960	Yeah, I guess
2466360	2468360	It's good
2469440	2471440	Now speculation
2471640	2477560	About the Star Trek movie into darkness. Oh, we're done talking Superman. Well, there's not really much else to say
2477560	2484040	You're gonna say Connor. Oh, here's what you're gonna say Todd. I I was like, I don't know. I don't even yeah
2484440	2486440	No, no, no, it's calm
2487160	2490600	You saw it. What if it's gone before we move on?
2491360	2496000	Okay, um a good nice little loop that the Superman
2496080	2503320	Trailer has created is that the first teaser trailer for Superman used the soundtrack from Lord of the Rings?
2504000	2507200	When Gandalf died in the first movie you remember that?
2515640	2517720	You guys they're right when you when you saw the
2519080	2524840	Yeah, and they I saw the YouTube Collins and everyone's like you guys are seeing like from Lord of the Rings
2524880	2531400	Walk. Yeah, just like Lord of the Rings stole the the theme from wrecking for a dream for the two towers trailer
2531400	2533400	Yeah, that's true. That's kind of bizarre
2533720	2536600	We'll see. I think I've been sorry, man. Just doing a double-end
2539120	2540320	Anal
2540320	2541960	Yeah, I
2541960	2547160	Didn't actually know what record right? Like I knew a record Jim was I've heard of it
2547160	2552120	But I'd never actually seen I didn't know that was the theme. So I thought it was badass if they had that in there
2552120	2553240	Yeah
2553240	2554880	Yeah
2554880	2559620	Anyways, okay. So moving on Star Trek looks very promising
2560280	2563560	That first is for wine. No, I don't you you
2564360	2570120	Know I see in the theater. I said or what a lot of people think it's calm, but I don't think it's calm
2570120	2572120	Okay. Okay. I didn't hear that
2572440	2574240	There's a I don't think it is
2574240	2578280	There's a character from the original series and you didn't hear this part because we're over using
2578960	2580200	Something was psychic guy, right?
2580200	2584160	There's a character from the original series and it was like a really a really well-made episode
2584400	2588960	And it was this guy who was kind of introverted. He was like a circular officer. Mm-hmm
2588960	2592080	He was a little bit introverted. He was kind of picked on he wasn't really treated that well by anybody
2592240	2593720	But he was really smart
2593720	2599000	And he had like Lee he had latent psychic powers that were brought out by some kind of
2599280	2603720	Phenomenon that the the ship encountered you mean like John Travolta and phenomena
2603720	2605720	Like
2606200	2607760	He became
2607760	2609760	basically all-powerful
2609840	2611760	So he did change the world
2611760	2617160	He was like wrecking the fucking ship and shit and like and then of course Kirk like beats the shit out of them because it's care
2617440	2621800	But everyone is saying that the villain in this is this guy
2623560	2625960	They're doing that story that's
2626560	2631240	That makes sense. I mean, I'm not opposed to that though. We were like, I've never seen the original episode
2631280	2636880	I'm actually tempted to go back and watch the original episode because there's a lot of Star Trek. I haven't seen more of a Star Wars guy
2636920	2641380	So yeah, yeah. Yeah, I don't be wrong. I mean I do like Star Trek to a degree
2641380	2645480	I just haven't gotten into it as much so this should be educational for sure
2646200	2650360	Really at the very least at the very least watching that one episode. Yeah
2651160	2657320	We're just watching all a lot of people are saying on the internet that that that's also instead of it being conx
2657320	2660560	He doesn't look like Connie's that he doesn't act like con. It's literally a regular, dude
2660560	2664480	Yeah, and that's what this guy was. Well, he doesn't have the fake muscles, but it still could be him
2666120	2668120	Ricardo Montalban
2669200	2674600	You know, I don't know man Radley Con was a good fucking movie. I think he was kind of overrated to be honest
2674600	2679740	Yeah, yeah same here. I really I really do. I I thought it was good, but I didn't think it was
2680400	2687040	You know best movie ever good. I didn't think it was it wasn't even I don't even say it's my favorite of the entire series
2687040	2689040	I have the Star Trek series. Yeah
2690000	2692000	Favorite of all the
2692160	2693720	first contact
2693720	2698520	That was like that's kind of different cuz like now you're talking about next generation or generations
2698520	2704740	I thought generations was very well done too. I don't agree with the first contact though. I didn't like generations at all. Really?
2706080	2711220	Otherwise, I'd say see it for me. I didn't think the first one was that fantastic
2712360	2716880	The original cast I think it's a toss-up between Wrath of Khan and the one with the whales
2719760	2725220	And then I actually know maybe that one was my favorite for generation for next generation
2725220	2731460	It's obviously going to be first. Yeah. Well, I need to be honest. I haven't even seen I mean ones after that
2731460	2739060	I haven't seen insurrection or nemesis because I thought they looked stupid and they ended up being quite shit. Yeah in the last one
2740160	2746140	Basically, they played war basically said yeah, we put like a dune buggy action scene in this cuz I like dune buggies
2747140	2749540	He even said that like in the fucking interview for the movie
2749540	2752540	Well, he did change his voice for that show. So I guess I had to give him that
2757340	2763140	This is very distracting actually watching I'll play red facts in the background. What else what other chatter was that?
2764100	2766100	Jacking the giant Slayer
2766300	2768300	That looks like it
2768860	2772980	That'd be like kind of thing. I'd bring my kid to if I had a kid. I don't have kids
2773960	2779100	That seems like McDonald's toy pillar, yes, it feels like basically
2780780	2783740	People are jumping on the Disney bandwagon like 20 years too late
2783780	2790220	Yeah, and there's there's grabbing out every single old tale they can and trying to make an epic. Oh, yeah, because it's it's it's
2791340	2793180	licensed right, yeah
2793180	2796940	So there's like taking every old not even mythological
2796940	2801780	There's a couple hundred years old story and you're just like let's make an epic fucking period piece out of this thing
2801780	2805300	Yeah, let's let's like him go over his travels. We can't fuck that one at all
2806740	2813460	Wait, are they actually others? They already made it man. It came out late 2005 or 2006 at Jack Black is Gulliver
2813940	2815940	Where the fuck was I?
2816340	2818340	Not watching it, obviously
2818820	2823540	Netflix I watched it as Jason Segel doing possibly the worst English accent I've ever
2824500	2828100	Mean like I could do a better English accent than that. He's like yours pretty good
2828700	2830700	It
2831540	2838740	Was it was fucking because go I love girls Travers go I love Gulliver's travel it is my of all classic literature
2838740	2841220	I'd say it's my favorite book because
2841820	2843820	It's just it's very it's very
2845020	2846100	sarcastic
2846100	2848100	tongue-in-cheek
2848140	2856060	Just really really biting the satirical look on the society at the time and but it's got this whole fancy kind of element to it
2856060	2862060	So if you haven't read it, I definitely recommend don't watch. Why are you recommending like a random book? No, you've related to Jack and the
2863620	2865860	It gets in the literature anyway
2867380	2872860	Nobody should make another travel movie ever again unless they know I'm decent. Yeah. Okay. Well Jack
2872860	2880220	Yeah, Jack and the Beanstalk, of course, and apparently the guy played Hurley or you like voices a giant. I think I heard yeah
2880700	2886300	I think I had heard that Jorge Garcia. I think he voices one of the one of the Giants in yeah
2887100	2892380	Only good basically tell who it is to if it if it is him because he's got this massive fro
2894100	2896300	Only point you actually see them in the trailer is him going
2900260	2905500	Yeah, it might be good for a few laughs but I don't see it being it looks pretty vapid
2906140	2907140	It's
2907140	2912060	Isn't it vapid if you have kids it'll shut them up for like an hour then they'll get bored
2912460	2914460	And then you'll never see the end. Yeah
2914700	2919300	it looks like it's gonna end up being really similar to um, I
2920580	2926420	Can see bombing like horribly the Red Riding Hood the Little Red Riding Hood. Yeah, I could hear you piece
2926420	2930700	I mean, I could see that that was done destroying itself. Yeah
2931700	2933500	Is that it?
2933500	2936620	I feel there was fun. There is a Will Smith one. Oh
2937460	2939500	Yeah, welcome to after earth. They're more
2940860	2944860	Teaser trailer, right? So there's not much to say and Will Smith and his kid are
2945980	2950500	Survivors of some kind of spaceship crash. You're right. I go with that at the very end of the trailer Will Smith
2950500	2952500	It's like it's like this planet is
2953220	2955220	And it's like well, yes
2956380	2959220	It's earth obviously, I thought it was after earth
2963580	2965580	For some reason all I could think of is after birth
2970460	2976300	In after earth you can pick up after 8 instead of just a Christmas how you're thinking of this
2980300	2982300	God
2982780	2989280	Yeah, I don't I'm not attacking after birth I think it's kind of it's pretty funny how much
2990700	2992700	How much?
2992900	2995180	Jaden Smith looks like his old man now, but
2995980	3001780	That's it. Was that kid who was within the same guy who did the karate kid? Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I'm straight
3001780	3004660	Well, the karate kid came out how many years ago? I
3005540	3010500	Don't remember. It was 2008. I think so. Is that 2008 or 2009?
3013260	3014860	Either way
3014860	3019460	It's been at least two or three years since since he filmed so the kids grown up a lot
3019460	3024620	So he looks like his old man. Anyways, uh, yeah, so all the lot I'd say the most
3024620	3029580	I'd probably want to see Superman steel the most and for me it's Star Trek and Superman
3029980	3036940	Yeah, Superman or just man of steel. Why is it Superman steel suddenly for us? It's man of steel. Yeah. Yeah, it's man of steel
3036940	3041420	Yeah, I'd say man steel and then start right. I'd actually want to see Star Trek more. I like the last movie
3041420	3044580	It was it was fantastic. It was really JJ Abrams
3046100	3048620	Actually making something that made sense
3049620	3054460	Wasn't just a bunch of loose ends. That was nice. Although that's also
3055580	3060060	Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse too. I don't think Carlton Cuse did anything on
3061100	3063100	the writing
3063220	3067220	Well on lost. Yeah, but I mean it's the first Star Trek. Oh, well, no, I'm not talking about that
3067220	3069920	I'm talking about lost. I think the first Star Trek was
3070540	3074220	Damon Lindelof and JJ Abrams. Yeah, there was no Carlton Cuse involved
3075620	3079060	Either way, it was it was tight made sense. That's the thing
3079460	3085580	Okay. Anyways, that's that's it for trailer talk. Yeah. Yeah, I'm done. I'm totally done. Isn't there one more?
3087340	3092580	You wrote something in your in your phone Oh warm body. Oh, yeah. Oh my god
3095380	3100060	Okay, okay first off for anyone out there who hates Twilight
3100380	3104820	You will hate this even more and I had never even heard of it until Devon. Devon even mentioned it
3105820	3107820	That thing on your head
3108180	3113660	Okay, so warm bodies is apparently the love story between a zombie and a human
3114460	3121900	Zombie somehow sees this woman and his heart starts beating again and he regained some kind of
3122900	3124900	some kind of consciousness some kind of
3125540	3127820	Sense of morality. I don't know
3127820	3132980	I get I'm guessing he still has the taste for human flesh and all that sort of thing because he'll always be haunted by his
3133180	3135180	desire for
3136060	3138380	You know for actually eating her
3140140	3145660	She's gonna love that it's it's the stupidest looking movie yeah, it's
3146900	3152060	Horrible, it's just absolutely atrocious. I only know I believe this shit will exist
3152060	3156900	I can only hope that the riff tracks guys do a riff track. Oh, you know, they're going to so I can watch it
3156900	3158580	Yeah, I'm not gonna watch it
3159180	3163940	I've even finished watching the Twilight movies with riff tracks. I've been putting it off putting it off, but you know what?
3163940	3167680	Yeah, I actually just watched them all of this before I before we went on brick
3167680	3172200	Christmas break I just I basically I had like a bunch of work around the house to do
3172200	3176520	Yeah, so I just put on my wireless headphones and I just listened to them for like
3177140	3182740	Ten hours you listen to it. Just yeah, cuz I'm not gonna watch the fucking the going around those cleaning stuff
3182740	3186740	Yeah, see that today like I'm thinking of actually sitting down and watching them
3187020	3189020	Even though it doesn't make any sense
3189020	3193900	I mean, I mean it doesn't make sense, but also make sense us to actually do what you're doing
3193900	3195900	Yeah, that's actually a really good idea
3197620	3199620	God
3199660	3201660	Just filth. I mean
3202100	3204740	They must know they're just like cashing in. Oh, yeah
3205740	3209140	They have how could they not be cashing in?
3209140	3215760	I mean, it's a love story between a supernatural creature and a human they were doing interviews on it
3216740	3221580	Remember like the short little interview ets and like they're yeah, they're trying to talk about like with a straight face
3222940	3225200	Yeah, they're actually that's the best acting
3228220	3231820	Much better than the movie itself. Well, maybe the girl ended be in
3232940	3240500	Better than and Bella's actress fuck. Yeah, she's pretty bland. I still can't believe she's gonna be an on the road
3240500	3246500	She's basically the real-life Brock
3253260	3255260	Yeah with warm bodies just
3256820	3262900	Jesus Christ that yeah, yeah, I think that's pretty much it more bodies Jesus Christ
3264580	3268340	You wanna go see are you saying that Jesus Christ is a zombie? Yes
3270740	3275540	I'm gonna wait for it to come to the discount theater that way that we can go and we'll probably get the entire theater ourselves
3275540	3280900	So we could sit there and like throw popcorn at the screen or like actually talk and actually talk
3282660	3285700	Here's the thing if we can actually put theater to ourselves we could actually film ourselves
3286460	3292760	Wow, that's not illegal. No film ourselves watching it and making fun of it. No actually filming the movie
3293940	3297100	So stop by apathetic teenagers. I don't think they're gonna care
3297620	3301300	Yeah, that's the great thing about the discount heater he wanted it's a discount
3301300	3305180	Yeah, but also that because it's in like an area of town
3305180	3309940	It's not quite as populated anymore. And you know that mall isn't quite get as much business
3309940	3313980	Oh and like when when you actually would watch a movie there, it's usually pretty empty
3314220	3317980	Yeah, I remember going there and just having like the entire place to yourself. Yeah
3317980	3324900	I would see Ted and there was yeah, there was just there's a two of us of the just do how do they stay in business?
3325900	3327900	Because some nights are better than others food
3328420	3333580	Yeah on the food to always the food cheap. Oh god. Yeah. No, no, it's not cheap. Sorry to so bad
3333580	3336820	It's like reasonable. It's not it's reader. Yeah, I mean, it's like half
3336820	3342780	It's still highly half like Austin Silver City fuck or simplex or whatever and your your average movie theater. It's so
3343780	3346260	That was like I don't go to movies that often
3346260	3351940	So I find it really fucking ridiculous when I like I'm looking at the prices for food 12 bucks for a hot dog and nachos
3352100	3355740	Oh my gosh, it was like fucking $8
3359420	3363780	Yeah, yeah, it's five bucks yeah, I got I bought a large and I ended up paying like
3365060	3369820	723 I think which sucks but at the same time there's a lot of food in a large bed
3369820	3375260	Yeah, actually, that's that's pretty considerable. I mean, you'll get I think popcorn farts, but that's okay
3377180	3380880	That's a risky take right high fiber content
3382140	3387220	I eat high-fiber like normally though with with yeah, I know but it was like fake butter on it
3387820	3391020	Yeah, that that's man horrible. Oh, man that big butter
3391980	3395140	Like here's the thing at this theater
3395700	3398820	You can like buy butter for like 20 cents or something to put on your popcorn, right?
3398820	3403580	And then I said I didn't know you do or you do it for free because this stuff was like I didn't buy the butter
3403580	3407020	But then they grape aside the interest of the theater. There is another station
3407020	3411660	There's like a free there's like a free but I want you just do this and then and Dave's like wall because this better
3412020	3418900	Try to I put it under and I press the button and what comes out is like apple juice. Yeah consistency of
3419540	3426300	Incredibly melted butter. Yeah, it's like pure yellow waters like piss. Just that's basically yeah fucking essentially
3426300	3431980	It's kind of tastes like it too. It just it didn't have a taste to it. It just basically moved up the popcorn
3432980	3437900	Grease, it's extra grease on your popcorn. It's not even like your sock work wherever you want to insert it
3438060	3443900	Just like pouring canola oil onto your popcorn essentially, yeah, that's our butter. It's kind of a little oil. Yeah
3445140	3452420	Okay. Well, that's enough trailer talk. We've been getting incredibly off-base. So I'm gonna enter right here. Anyways, fuck
3452420	3458940	I'm thanks for watching and I'm going what the fuck was that coming in your mouth? That was me saying have a good one
3459100	3461100	What was the sound?
3461240	3463240	What is that sound?
3468380	3470380	You're adorable
3472340	3474340	Oh, yeah
