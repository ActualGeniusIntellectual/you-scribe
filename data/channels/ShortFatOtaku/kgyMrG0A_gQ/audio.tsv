0	10480	In doing research for HCIC4, I came across this video clip.
30000	57040	The person who tweeted the clip also asked how had Jordan Peterson never heard this extremely
57040	61600	basic counterargument to his position before, and followed up with, some of the same people
61600	65520	that think Peterson is one of the greatest intellectuals of the modern age are now telling
65520	69240	me it's unfair to expect him to be familiar with the Civil Rights Act.
69240	73960	While I do like some of Jordan Peterson's work, I'm not here to be a Peterson apologist.
73960	77880	He fumbled this question pretty badly, but whether he truly doesn't know or was simply
77880	85540	put on the spot, there is an answer to this question that isn't just complete capitulation.
85540	90400	What the host is colloquially referring to is the Masterpiece Cakeshop vs Colorado Civil
90400	94820	Rights Commission court case, which recently wrapped up, and in this colloquial reference
94820	98200	to the case, he misrepresents the details of the situation.
98200	102780	I don't think he did it maliciously, the phrase, bake the cake, rolls off the tongue easily,
102780	107520	has become a sort of a catchy meme, and has since entered the public lexicon as shorthand
107520	110580	for this situation, however inaccurate it actually is.
110580	114620	Hell, it's why I used it too, I wanted you to click on this video after all.
114620	118160	But here's the actual details of the case, from the court documents.
118160	123380	In 2012 Charlie Craig and David Mullins made plans to be married in Massachusetts because
123380	127600	their home state of Colorado did not at the time allow gay marriages.
127600	133020	Gay marriages would not become legal in all 50 states until 2015 with the Obergefell vs
133020	134120	Hodges case.
134120	138980	The two decided to prepare for their celebration by visiting the Masterpiece Cakeshop run by
138980	141660	Jack Phillips to order a cake for their wedding.
141660	146500	Phillips informed him that he does not, in his words, create wedding cakes for same-sex
146500	147500	weddings.
147500	151860	He explained, I'll make your birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you cookies and brownies,
151860	154820	I just don't make cakes for same-sex weddings.
154820	158900	Phillips explained that he does not create wedding cakes for same-sex marriages because
158900	163700	of his religious opposition, and also because Colorado at that time did not recognize such
163700	164700	marriages.
164700	168420	He later explained his belief that to create a wedding cake for an event that celebrated
168420	172260	something that directly goes against the teachings of the Bible would have been a personal
172260	177000	endorsement and participation in the ceremony and relationship that they were entering into.
177000	180720	And just so we're clear, Phillips is a devout Christian who has explained that his main
180720	185580	goal in life is to be obedient to Christ's teachings in all aspects of his life, and
185580	189120	that he seeks to honor God through his work at the Masterpiece Cakeshop.
189120	193100	To Phillips, creating a wedding cake for a same-sex marriage would be the equivalent
193100	197280	to participating in a celebration that is contrary to his most deeply held beliefs.
197280	202160	This is why it's not simply baking a cake, and why Phillips used the term create multiple
202160	206780	times in the court documents to describe the process of generating a new cake.
206780	210660	When you simply bake a cake, frankly there's not much original input to it.
210660	213120	You follow a cookbook properly and you get a cake.
213120	219080	But creating a cake, that's a different matter.
219080	220820	And here's why it's not a good idea.
220820	225080	Look at these cakes and tell me that these aren't something more, something larger,
225080	228760	and then following the instructions on the back of a Betty Crocker Just Add Water cake
228760	229840	mix box.
229840	234560	If movies are art, if video games are art, then it seems pretty clear to me that custom
234560	237720	made cakes can certainly be considered art as well.
237720	241540	And when you get into the government forcing people to create art they disagree with, that's
241540	254080	the realm of compelled speech.
254080	256600	That's actually the right answer, believe it or not.
256600	261000	If I knew of a local shop that I frequented that refused to sell goods to black people,
261000	265240	assuming that it were still legal to do so, I would stop frequenting that shop.
265240	269560	And I think, as the word got out, a lot of people would also stop frequenting that shop
269560	270560	as well.
270560	274760	Despite what social justice warriors say, the western world is not a hotbed of racism
274760	275760	and misogyny.
275760	278360	The western world is actually incredibly tolerant.
278360	282640	A shop that refused to sell to black people in this day and age would probably go out
282640	287280	of business because not only would it not get any money from potential black customers,
287280	291640	it also would not get any money from non-black customers who wouldn't stand for their fellow
291640	293600	citizens being treated that way.
293600	297520	Nonetheless, it wasn't always like that, and refusing to sell to a customer based on their
297520	302980	skin colour was made illegal back during a time in which it was actually a serious problem,
302980	315540	as the host goes on to describe here.
315540	319180	This is a nonsense question, and I'm a little disappointed Peterson didn't call him out
319180	320180	on it.
320180	321940	The two positions aren't mutually exclusive.
321940	326420	I would argue that giving businesses the freedom to discriminate, and potentially lose a fatal
326420	331540	amount of business for doing so, as well as forcing businesses to serve the entire population
331540	334940	fairly are both viable solutions to the problem.
334940	339340	The reason the second solution was implemented is because at the time, public opinion on
339340	343160	race in the United States would have made the first solution ineffectual.
343160	348580	But that's not the case now, and that's why Peterson says it was right.
348580	354340	But just because it was right doesn't mean that he was wrong, he was simply caught unprepared.
354340	363500	Well, there's actually a few reasons why discrimination based on race in a public restaurant
363500	368280	is different than discrimination based on same-sex marriage status in procuring a good
368280	370580	or service related to the marriage.
370580	374860	One, in the civil rights example, the black person being refused service at a restaurant,
374860	379220	the service the black person was attempting to obtain had nothing to do with his race.
379220	383700	He was simply looking to be served food, and the owners of the restaurant made it racially
383700	385260	based by refusing him.
385260	389660	However, in the example of a same-sex couple obtaining a custom-made cake for their wedding,
389660	394340	the service they were attempting to procure was already innately based in their same-sex
394340	397620	relationship before Phillips's objection ever came up.
397620	402140	The restaurant that refused to serve black customers forced the issue to be about race,
402140	405320	but Phillips did not force the issue to be about homosexuality.
405320	407040	It already was from the beginning.
407040	411640	If we actually wanted to bring race into it, a more apt example would be, say, a black
411640	416680	person going into a tailor's shop and requesting its white supremacist owner to make him a
416680	418360	Black Lives Matter shirt.
418360	423440	In both of these cases, the shop owners and patrons are directly opposed to each other
423440	427460	both in ideology and in the very nature of the work they're requesting.
427460	432280	But regarding the restaurant example, there is nothing in the nature of serving food that
432280	436880	innately excludes serving black people, leaving only racism as the motivation.
436880	442020	Two, if the argument is based in religious faith, the edicts regarding homosexuality
442020	446500	in the Bible are a lot more clear-cut than the ones regarding racial discrimination.
446500	450340	To be fair, in my opinion, neither of them are all that clear to begin with.
450340	454160	But the ones regarding homosexuality still seem to be the clearer of the two, with the
454160	458200	whole don't lie with another man as if he were a woman part.
458200	463000	There's stuff in the Bible regarding slavery, sure, but it's never race-based slavery,
463000	467600	and the Bible's got nothing to say about using visible racial characteristics to create
467600	469160	a class system either.
469160	473720	Phillip's religious objection to creating a custom cake therefore holds a lot more water
473720	475640	than anything from the civil rights era.
475640	481080	Three, if the argument is based in free speech, the businesses that objected to serving black
481080	484920	people back during the civil rights era didn't have a leg to stand on.
484920	489600	Whether it was ordering a cup of coffee at a diner, purchasing lumber or tools at a hardware
489600	494360	store, getting your car fixed at a mechanic's garage, or studying at a school, none of these
494360	498640	things involved violating the free speech rights of the people offering those goods
498640	499640	and services.
499640	505600	Mass-produced food, basic equipment and materials, and practical services are not artistic endeavors
505600	510840	and are not covered by free speech rights, however the commission of artwork is.
510840	515520	And that's really the core of the court case, and also why Masterpiece Cakeshop ultimately
515520	516520	won.
516520	520480	The court ruled that Phillip's had provided enough evidence that he was a devout Christian,
520480	524200	that he wasn't simply using the excuse of faith to be a dick or whatever, and that the
524200	528800	Colorado Human Rights Commission had overstepped its bounds by not taking into account Phillip's
528800	534360	faith, and in failing to do so violated its oath to not discriminate on the basis of religion.
534360	538300	In fact, the commission seemed to relish the chance to violate that oath.
538300	543440	During the May 30th, 2014 meeting convened to discuss the case, commissioners endorsed
543440	548240	the view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial
548240	552320	domain, and that one commissioner suggested that Phillips can believe what he wants to
552320	557660	believe but cannot act on his religious beliefs if he decides to do business in the state.
557660	561520	And in the July 25th, 2014 meeting, another commissioner said,
561520	566000	Freedom of religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination, whether it be
566000	572100	slavery, whether it be the Holocaust, whether it be, I mean, we can list hundreds of situations
572100	575900	where freedom of religion has been used to justify discrimination, and to me it is one
575900	581180	of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use to use their religion
581180	582340	to hurt others.
582340	585620	If only Europe could take this point of view regarding Islam, almost all your problems
585620	586620	would be solved.
586620	587620	Oh well.
587620	590560	I understand the protection of Phillips's religious rights are important, but in my
590560	595100	opinion it's the free speech rights that are the cornerstone of this case, and significant
595100	598620	parts of the court documents are also devoted to the free speech issue as well.
598620	600180	But let me simplify it for you.
600180	604140	Let's say a gay couple was looking to hire a painter to paint a portrait of the two of
604140	605660	them together during their wedding.
605660	610540	A painter they approach refuses to do so because he personally objects to their homosexual
610540	613220	relationship and marriage on religious grounds.
613220	614820	Is that painter an asshole?
614820	615820	Probably.
615820	620300	But should he be coerced by the state into creating a painting, artwork, he disagrees
620300	621300	with?
621300	622300	Absolutely not.
622300	625940	Because if the state were to step in in that manner, they'd be prioritizing the offense
625940	630060	of the gay couple's negative reaction to being rejected over the offense of the painter
630060	631620	to the gay couple's relationship.
631620	636580	The government's role cannot be to stifle free speech in the name of subjective offense,
636580	642400	especially in the name of one person's subjective offense over another person's different subjective
642400	643400	offense.
643400	647020	It's very easy to hand wave these implications away when it's decorating a cake for a gay
647020	648020	couple.
648020	651060	But what if it's commissioning artwork for a topic that's not so clear cut?
651060	656040	What if a shady business wants artwork done and the government compels artists who otherwise
656040	658980	would not work for that business due to their practices?
658980	663420	What if the government itself wants propaganda made for the military or a political candidate
663420	666540	and compels objecting artists into participating?
666540	671720	If we allow any artist, even if their canvas is a cake, to be forced by state power to
671720	676340	create artwork they fundamentally disagree with, that is the slipperiest of slopes.
676340	683140	Because very soon, it will go from the artwork you can create, to the artwork you must create,
683140	685640	to the artwork you must not create.
685640	688140	So to bake or not to bake?
688140	692920	Well, sure, bake is the obvious answer, but that's because it's the wrong question.
692920	698100	The real question is to decorate or not to decorate, and the only answer to that that
698100	701220	we can accept is only if you want to.
701220	704100	Oh, and let me just indulge a little bit, okay?
704100	707940	The main reason I found this clip of Jordan Peterson in the first place was because Ian,
707940	712340	a friend of mine from the old Let's Playing crowd I used to run with a few years back,
712340	713340	liked it on Twitter.
713340	716620	And unfortunately, I guess I'm just burning all of the bridges from that circle at this
716620	718360	point in making this video.
718360	723300	Back in August of 2017, I made a video called The Moral Equivalence Between the Alt-Right
723300	724300	and Antifa.
724300	728780	In that video, I responded to two acquaintances of mine from that friend group, people that
728780	734340	I knew to be reasonable and rational, Rick from The D-Pad, and Casey, Ian's girlfriend,
734340	737620	about how Charlottesville had made them both go off the deep end.
737620	739300	And well, I'm now blocked by both of them.
739300	743820	I hope it doesn't go that way with Ian, but it has to be said, Jordan Peterson's
743820	744820	still right, man.
744820	749020	We might joke about things like Trump Derangement Syndrome, but honestly, the number of friends
749020	754100	I've lost, the number of people who went from chill center lefties to radicalized lunatics,
754100	756180	is well into the double digits at this point.
756180	760500	I mean, they often say it's me who's the radical lunatic now, not them.
760500	765260	But it's me, and other people like me, who, for example, forgave the likes of Ian Miles
765260	769460	Chong when he pulled himself out of the SJW cesspit and apologized for what he had said
769460	770460	and done.
770460	774540	Even though Jordan Peterson was wrong to have capitulated on the cake question, what kind
774580	779340	of chance do you think that SJWs are actually going to reach for the olive branch that Jordan
779340	780340	Peterson extended?
780340	781860	The way that you or I would.
781860	787700	He's a 56 year old intellectual, and he had never heard of the simplest and first argument
787700	790020	people go to against a position he holds.
790020	793580	I'm digging the people that are replying to you that are super proud of him to admitting
793580	796500	he was wrong only because he was caught on camera.
796500	801940	Jordan Peterson being completely blindsided by the existence of the Civil Rights Act actually
801940	807060	just made me respect him more as an intellectual, a human, and a prophet.
807060	813020	I too sometimes forget small details like the Civil Rights Act and all of history when
813020	815180	I form my political positions.
815180	818260	This is why you never give in to these people.
818260	821500	Because to them it's not a debate, it's a wedge.
821500	825580	When you concede, that's them stuffing the wedge into the crack, and then they're going
825580	829500	to spend the rest of that time widening that crack until you break.
829500	833400	For us, if a person's made a mistake and is asking for forgiveness, it's usually
833400	837160	a good idea to at least give them the chance to re-earn our trust.
837160	841900	But for SJWs, they're not interested in second chances or re-earned trust.
841900	846180	They're interested in ideological reinforcement and brutal punishment of dissent.
846180	848640	And that's why the cake question is so important.
848640	851020	For us, it's a matter of free speech.
851020	853780	For them, it's a matter of control.
853780	856020	I hope you enjoyed the video, thank you for watching.
856020	859260	Please consider supporting the channel on Patreon or through other sources.
859260	862940	The linked video is a detailed discussion as to why and how, but long story short a
862940	867080	bunch of my equipment decided to all go belly up at once, and while I don't like the idea
867080	869100	of shilling I find myself at an impasse.
869100	872180	So if you can pitch in a few bucks I'd be eternally grateful.
872180	873620	And remember, I love you.
