1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
In doing research for HCIC4, I came across this video clip.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:57,040
The person who tweeted the clip also asked how had Jordan Peterson never heard this extremely

3
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,600
basic counterargument to his position before, and followed up with, some of the same people

4
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,520
that think Peterson is one of the greatest intellectuals of the modern age are now telling

5
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,240
me it's unfair to expect him to be familiar with the Civil Rights Act.

6
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,960
While I do like some of Jordan Peterson's work, I'm not here to be a Peterson apologist.

7
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,880
He fumbled this question pretty badly, but whether he truly doesn't know or was simply

8
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,540
put on the spot, there is an answer to this question that isn't just complete capitulation.

9
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,400
What the host is colloquially referring to is the Masterpiece Cakeshop vs Colorado Civil

10
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,820
Rights Commission court case, which recently wrapped up, and in this colloquial reference

11
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,200
to the case, he misrepresents the details of the situation.

12
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,780
I don't think he did it maliciously, the phrase, bake the cake, rolls off the tongue easily,

13
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,520
has become a sort of a catchy meme, and has since entered the public lexicon as shorthand

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,580
for this situation, however inaccurate it actually is.

15
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,620
Hell, it's why I used it too, I wanted you to click on this video after all.

16
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,160
But here's the actual details of the case, from the court documents.

17
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,380
In 2012 Charlie Craig and David Mullins made plans to be married in Massachusetts because

18
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,600
their home state of Colorado did not at the time allow gay marriages.

19
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,020
Gay marriages would not become legal in all 50 states until 2015 with the Obergefell vs

20
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,120
Hodges case.

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,980
The two decided to prepare for their celebration by visiting the Masterpiece Cakeshop run by

22
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,660
Jack Phillips to order a cake for their wedding.

23
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,500
Phillips informed him that he does not, in his words, create wedding cakes for same-sex

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
weddings.

25
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,860
He explained, I'll make your birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you cookies and brownies,

26
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,820
I just don't make cakes for same-sex weddings.

27
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,900
Phillips explained that he does not create wedding cakes for same-sex marriages because

28
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,700
of his religious opposition, and also because Colorado at that time did not recognize such

29
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,700
marriages.

30
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,420
He later explained his belief that to create a wedding cake for an event that celebrated

31
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,260
something that directly goes against the teachings of the Bible would have been a personal

32
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,000
endorsement and participation in the ceremony and relationship that they were entering into.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,720
And just so we're clear, Phillips is a devout Christian who has explained that his main

34
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,580
goal in life is to be obedient to Christ's teachings in all aspects of his life, and

35
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,120
that he seeks to honor God through his work at the Masterpiece Cakeshop.

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,100
To Phillips, creating a wedding cake for a same-sex marriage would be the equivalent

37
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,280
to participating in a celebration that is contrary to his most deeply held beliefs.

38
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,160
This is why it's not simply baking a cake, and why Phillips used the term create multiple

39
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,780
times in the court documents to describe the process of generating a new cake.

40
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,660
When you simply bake a cake, frankly there's not much original input to it.

41
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,120
You follow a cookbook properly and you get a cake.

42
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,080
But creating a cake, that's a different matter.

43
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,820
And here's why it's not a good idea.

44
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,080
Look at these cakes and tell me that these aren't something more, something larger,

45
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,760
and then following the instructions on the back of a Betty Crocker Just Add Water cake

46
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,840
mix box.

47
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,560
If movies are art, if video games are art, then it seems pretty clear to me that custom

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,720
made cakes can certainly be considered art as well.

49
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,540
And when you get into the government forcing people to create art they disagree with, that's

50
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:14,080
the realm of compelled speech.

51
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,600
That's actually the right answer, believe it or not.

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,000
If I knew of a local shop that I frequented that refused to sell goods to black people,

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,240
assuming that it were still legal to do so, I would stop frequenting that shop.

54
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,560
And I think, as the word got out, a lot of people would also stop frequenting that shop

55
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
as well.

56
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,760
Despite what social justice warriors say, the western world is not a hotbed of racism

57
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
and misogyny.

58
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,360
The western world is actually incredibly tolerant.

59
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,640
A shop that refused to sell to black people in this day and age would probably go out

60
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,280
of business because not only would it not get any money from potential black customers,

61
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,640
it also would not get any money from non-black customers who wouldn't stand for their fellow

62
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,600
citizens being treated that way.

63
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,520
Nonetheless, it wasn't always like that, and refusing to sell to a customer based on their

64
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,980
skin colour was made illegal back during a time in which it was actually a serious problem,

65
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:15,540
as the host goes on to describe here.

66
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,180
This is a nonsense question, and I'm a little disappointed Peterson didn't call him out

67
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
on it.

68
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,940
The two positions aren't mutually exclusive.

69
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,420
I would argue that giving businesses the freedom to discriminate, and potentially lose a fatal

70
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,540
amount of business for doing so, as well as forcing businesses to serve the entire population

71
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,940
fairly are both viable solutions to the problem.

72
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,340
The reason the second solution was implemented is because at the time, public opinion on

73
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,160
race in the United States would have made the first solution ineffectual.

74
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,580
But that's not the case now, and that's why Peterson says it was right.

75
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,340
But just because it was right doesn't mean that he was wrong, he was simply caught unprepared.

76
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:03,500
Well, there's actually a few reasons why discrimination based on race in a public restaurant

77
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,280
is different than discrimination based on same-sex marriage status in procuring a good

78
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,580
or service related to the marriage.

79
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,860
One, in the civil rights example, the black person being refused service at a restaurant,

80
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,220
the service the black person was attempting to obtain had nothing to do with his race.

81
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,700
He was simply looking to be served food, and the owners of the restaurant made it racially

82
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,260
based by refusing him.

83
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,660
However, in the example of a same-sex couple obtaining a custom-made cake for their wedding,

84
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,340
the service they were attempting to procure was already innately based in their same-sex

85
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,620
relationship before Phillips's objection ever came up.

86
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,140
The restaurant that refused to serve black customers forced the issue to be about race,

87
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,320
but Phillips did not force the issue to be about homosexuality.

88
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,040
It already was from the beginning.

89
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,640
If we actually wanted to bring race into it, a more apt example would be, say, a black

90
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,680
person going into a tailor's shop and requesting its white supremacist owner to make him a

91
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,360
Black Lives Matter shirt.

92
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,440
In both of these cases, the shop owners and patrons are directly opposed to each other

93
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,460
both in ideology and in the very nature of the work they're requesting.

94
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,280
But regarding the restaurant example, there is nothing in the nature of serving food that

95
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,880
innately excludes serving black people, leaving only racism as the motivation.

96
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,020
Two, if the argument is based in religious faith, the edicts regarding homosexuality

97
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,500
in the Bible are a lot more clear-cut than the ones regarding racial discrimination.

98
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,340
To be fair, in my opinion, neither of them are all that clear to begin with.

99
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,160
But the ones regarding homosexuality still seem to be the clearer of the two, with the

100
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,200
whole don't lie with another man as if he were a woman part.

101
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,000
There's stuff in the Bible regarding slavery, sure, but it's never race-based slavery,

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,600
and the Bible's got nothing to say about using visible racial characteristics to create

103
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,160
a class system either.

104
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,720
Phillip's religious objection to creating a custom cake therefore holds a lot more water

105
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,640
than anything from the civil rights era.

106
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:01,080
Three, if the argument is based in free speech, the businesses that objected to serving black

107
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,920
people back during the civil rights era didn't have a leg to stand on.

108
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,600
Whether it was ordering a cup of coffee at a diner, purchasing lumber or tools at a hardware

109
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,360
store, getting your car fixed at a mechanic's garage, or studying at a school, none of these

110
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,640
things involved violating the free speech rights of the people offering those goods

111
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
and services.

112
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,600
Mass-produced food, basic equipment and materials, and practical services are not artistic endeavors

113
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,840
and are not covered by free speech rights, however the commission of artwork is.

114
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,520
And that's really the core of the court case, and also why Masterpiece Cakeshop ultimately

115
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
won.

116
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,480
The court ruled that Phillip's had provided enough evidence that he was a devout Christian,

117
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,200
that he wasn't simply using the excuse of faith to be a dick or whatever, and that the

118
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,800
Colorado Human Rights Commission had overstepped its bounds by not taking into account Phillip's

119
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,360
faith, and in failing to do so violated its oath to not discriminate on the basis of religion.

120
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,300
In fact, the commission seemed to relish the chance to violate that oath.

121
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,440
During the May 30th, 2014 meeting convened to discuss the case, commissioners endorsed

122
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,240
the view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial

123
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,320
domain, and that one commissioner suggested that Phillips can believe what he wants to

124
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,660
believe but cannot act on his religious beliefs if he decides to do business in the state.

125
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,520
And in the July 25th, 2014 meeting, another commissioner said,

126
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,000
Freedom of religion has been used to justify all kinds of discrimination, whether it be

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,100
slavery, whether it be the Holocaust, whether it be, I mean, we can list hundreds of situations

128
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,900
where freedom of religion has been used to justify discrimination, and to me it is one

129
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:41,180
of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use to use their religion

130
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,340
to hurt others.

131
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,620
If only Europe could take this point of view regarding Islam, almost all your problems

132
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,620
would be solved.

133
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
Oh well.

134
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,560
I understand the protection of Phillips's religious rights are important, but in my

135
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,100
opinion it's the free speech rights that are the cornerstone of this case, and significant

136
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,620
parts of the court documents are also devoted to the free speech issue as well.

137
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,180
But let me simplify it for you.

138
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,140
Let's say a gay couple was looking to hire a painter to paint a portrait of the two of

139
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,660
them together during their wedding.

140
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,540
A painter they approach refuses to do so because he personally objects to their homosexual

141
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,220
relationship and marriage on religious grounds.

142
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,820
Is that painter an asshole?

143
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,820
Probably.

144
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,300
But should he be coerced by the state into creating a painting, artwork, he disagrees

145
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,300
with?

146
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,300
Absolutely not.

147
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,940
Because if the state were to step in in that manner, they'd be prioritizing the offense

148
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,060
of the gay couple's negative reaction to being rejected over the offense of the painter

149
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,620
to the gay couple's relationship.

150
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,580
The government's role cannot be to stifle free speech in the name of subjective offense,

151
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,400
especially in the name of one person's subjective offense over another person's different subjective

152
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
offense.

153
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,020
It's very easy to hand wave these implications away when it's decorating a cake for a gay

154
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
couple.

155
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,060
But what if it's commissioning artwork for a topic that's not so clear cut?

156
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,040
What if a shady business wants artwork done and the government compels artists who otherwise

157
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,980
would not work for that business due to their practices?

158
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,420
What if the government itself wants propaganda made for the military or a political candidate

159
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,540
and compels objecting artists into participating?

160
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,720
If we allow any artist, even if their canvas is a cake, to be forced by state power to

161
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,340
create artwork they fundamentally disagree with, that is the slipperiest of slopes.

162
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:23,140
Because very soon, it will go from the artwork you can create, to the artwork you must create,

163
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,640
to the artwork you must not create.

164
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,140
So to bake or not to bake?

165
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,920
Well, sure, bake is the obvious answer, but that's because it's the wrong question.

166
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,100
The real question is to decorate or not to decorate, and the only answer to that that

167
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,220
we can accept is only if you want to.

168
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,100
Oh, and let me just indulge a little bit, okay?

169
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,940
The main reason I found this clip of Jordan Peterson in the first place was because Ian,

170
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,340
a friend of mine from the old Let's Playing crowd I used to run with a few years back,

171
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,340
liked it on Twitter.

172
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,620
And unfortunately, I guess I'm just burning all of the bridges from that circle at this

173
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,360
point in making this video.

174
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,300
Back in August of 2017, I made a video called The Moral Equivalence Between the Alt-Right

175
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
and Antifa.

176
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,780
In that video, I responded to two acquaintances of mine from that friend group, people that

177
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,340
I knew to be reasonable and rational, Rick from The D-Pad, and Casey, Ian's girlfriend,

178
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,620
about how Charlottesville had made them both go off the deep end.

179
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,300
And well, I'm now blocked by both of them.

180
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,820
I hope it doesn't go that way with Ian, but it has to be said, Jordan Peterson's

181
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,820
still right, man.

182
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,020
We might joke about things like Trump Derangement Syndrome, but honestly, the number of friends

183
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,100
I've lost, the number of people who went from chill center lefties to radicalized lunatics,

184
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,180
is well into the double digits at this point.

185
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,500
I mean, they often say it's me who's the radical lunatic now, not them.

186
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,260
But it's me, and other people like me, who, for example, forgave the likes of Ian Miles

187
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,460
Chong when he pulled himself out of the SJW cesspit and apologized for what he had said

188
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,460
and done.

189
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,540
Even though Jordan Peterson was wrong to have capitulated on the cake question, what kind

190
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,340
of chance do you think that SJWs are actually going to reach for the olive branch that Jordan

191
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,340
Peterson extended?

192
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,860
The way that you or I would.

193
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,700
He's a 56 year old intellectual, and he had never heard of the simplest and first argument

194
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,020
people go to against a position he holds.

195
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,580
I'm digging the people that are replying to you that are super proud of him to admitting

196
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,500
he was wrong only because he was caught on camera.

197
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,940
Jordan Peterson being completely blindsided by the existence of the Civil Rights Act actually

198
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:27,060
just made me respect him more as an intellectual, a human, and a prophet.

199
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:33,020
I too sometimes forget small details like the Civil Rights Act and all of history when

200
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,180
I form my political positions.

201
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,260
This is why you never give in to these people.

202
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,500
Because to them it's not a debate, it's a wedge.

203
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,580
When you concede, that's them stuffing the wedge into the crack, and then they're going

204
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,500
to spend the rest of that time widening that crack until you break.

205
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,400
For us, if a person's made a mistake and is asking for forgiveness, it's usually

206
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,160
a good idea to at least give them the chance to re-earn our trust.

207
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,900
But for SJWs, they're not interested in second chances or re-earned trust.

208
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,180
They're interested in ideological reinforcement and brutal punishment of dissent.

209
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,640
And that's why the cake question is so important.

210
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,020
For us, it's a matter of free speech.

211
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,780
For them, it's a matter of control.

212
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,020
I hope you enjoyed the video, thank you for watching.

The linked video is a detailed discussion as to why and how, but long story short a

215
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,080
bunch of my equipment decided to all go belly up at once, and while I don't like the idea

216
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,100
of shilling I find myself at an impasse.

217
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,180
So if you can pitch in a few bucks I'd be eternally grateful.

218
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,620
And remember, I love you.
