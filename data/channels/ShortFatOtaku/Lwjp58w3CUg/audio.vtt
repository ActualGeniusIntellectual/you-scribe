Hey ya buddies! I've announced it in a few other places so I might as well announce it here and

00:04.880 --> 00:12.560
make it official. I am going on a one week vacation from Friday January 6th to Friday

00:12.560 --> 00:20.480
January 13th. That's tomorrow. I am going to be 100% gone. That doesn't just mean no SFO videos.

00:20.480 --> 00:26.080
That means no weekly SIP, no tubcast, and no SFO arcade in the evenings. I'm going to be out of

00:26.080 --> 00:31.360
here offline for one week. Don't worry, I'll be keeping busy. The video meant to bring me back

00:31.360 --> 00:36.240
on the 13th has already been made. As for what it is, that's a secret. But I'll return on the 13th

00:36.240 --> 00:40.880
with a new video and a new SFO arcade streamed that night. But it's not like today's video.

00:40.880 --> 00:44.800
The more legitimacy of the minority is the last that you'll hear of me for a week.

00:44.800 --> 00:51.360
Absolutely not. I have set up completely uncensored versions of my old Lord of the Rings

00:52.320 --> 00:58.400
Season 1 Watch Party videos to come out over the course of the week. So from the 6th to the 12th,

00:58.400 --> 01:03.120
you will see our reaction to all 8 of those episodes release again. I know this is older

01:03.120 --> 01:07.040
content, but when I had to upload it to YouTube last time, it had to have a big censorship

01:07.040 --> 01:10.880
sticker over it. And that was kind of annoying. So these versions, they've been uploaded and just

01:10.880 --> 01:16.000
set private for months now. They've worked through all the copyright nonsense. I won all the copyright

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
strikes, of course. And so you can watch me, Lilith, Arch, Kibz, and for a little bit, Taftash,

01:22.000 --> 01:27.200
react to the Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power Season 1 in all of its uncensored glory.

01:27.200 --> 01:31.280
So if for some reason you missed that stuff back when the show was coming out during the summer,

01:31.280 --> 01:35.040
you can check it out right now. I know that these videos weren't exactly my most popular,

01:35.040 --> 01:38.480
but you know what, in my opinion, they were actually pretty good. So please consider watching

01:38.480 --> 01:43.200
them when I'm gone. And I will see you in one week. Thank you very much for sticking by me.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.240
Thanks for watching everything. Thanks for supporting the channel. Thanks for donating

01:46.240 --> 01:51.440
to the channel when you do. I appreciate everything and I love you all. I'll see you next time.
