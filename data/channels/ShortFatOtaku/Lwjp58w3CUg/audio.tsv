0	4880	Hey ya buddies! I've announced it in a few other places so I might as well announce it here and
4880	12560	make it official. I am going on a one week vacation from Friday January 6th to Friday
12560	20480	January 13th. That's tomorrow. I am going to be 100% gone. That doesn't just mean no SFO videos.
20480	26080	That means no weekly SIP, no tubcast, and no SFO arcade in the evenings. I'm going to be out of
26080	31360	here offline for one week. Don't worry, I'll be keeping busy. The video meant to bring me back
31360	36240	on the 13th has already been made. As for what it is, that's a secret. But I'll return on the 13th
36240	40880	with a new video and a new SFO arcade streamed that night. But it's not like today's video.
40880	44800	The more legitimacy of the minority is the last that you'll hear of me for a week.
44800	51360	Absolutely not. I have set up completely uncensored versions of my old Lord of the Rings
52320	58400	Season 1 Watch Party videos to come out over the course of the week. So from the 6th to the 12th,
58400	63120	you will see our reaction to all 8 of those episodes release again. I know this is older
63120	67040	content, but when I had to upload it to YouTube last time, it had to have a big censorship
67040	70880	sticker over it. And that was kind of annoying. So these versions, they've been uploaded and just
70880	76000	set private for months now. They've worked through all the copyright nonsense. I won all the copyright
76000	82000	strikes, of course. And so you can watch me, Lilith, Arch, Kibz, and for a little bit, Taftash,
82000	87200	react to the Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power Season 1 in all of its uncensored glory.
87200	91280	So if for some reason you missed that stuff back when the show was coming out during the summer,
91280	95040	you can check it out right now. I know that these videos weren't exactly my most popular,
95040	98480	but you know what, in my opinion, they were actually pretty good. So please consider watching
98480	103200	them when I'm gone. And I will see you in one week. Thank you very much for sticking by me.
103200	106240	Thanks for watching everything. Thanks for supporting the channel. Thanks for donating
106240	111440	to the channel when you do. I appreciate everything and I love you all. I'll see you next time.
