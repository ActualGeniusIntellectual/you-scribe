00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Hey ya buddies! I've announced it in a few other places so I might as well announce it here and

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,560
make it official. I am going on a one week vacation from Friday January 6th to Friday

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:20,480
January 13th. That's tomorrow. I am going to be 100% gone. That doesn't just mean no SFO videos.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,080
That means no weekly SIP, no tubcast, and no SFO arcade in the evenings. I'm going to be out of

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,360
here offline for one week. Don't worry, I'll be keeping busy. The video meant to bring me back

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,240
on the 13th has already been made. As for what it is, that's a secret. But I'll return on the 13th

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,880
with a new video and a new SFO arcade streamed that night. But it's not like today's video.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,800
The more legitimacy of the minority is the last that you'll hear of me for a week.

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,360
Absolutely not. I have set up completely uncensored versions of my old Lord of the Rings

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,400
Season 1 Watch Party videos to come out over the course of the week. So from the 6th to the 12th,

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,120
you will see our reaction to all 8 of those episodes release again. I know this is older

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
content, but when I had to upload it to YouTube last time, it had to have a big censorship

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,880
sticker over it. And that was kind of annoying. So these versions, they've been uploaded and just

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,000
set private for months now. They've worked through all the copyright nonsense. I won all the copyright

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
strikes, of course. And so you can watch me, Lilith, Arch, Kibz, and for a little bit, Taftash,

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,200
react to the Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power Season 1 in all of its uncensored glory.

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,280
So if for some reason you missed that stuff back when the show was coming out during the summer,

18
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,040
you can check it out right now. I know that these videos weren't exactly my most popular,

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,480
but you know what, in my opinion, they were actually pretty good. So please consider watching

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,200
them when I'm gone. And I will see you in one week. Thank you very much for sticking by me.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
Thanks for watching everything. Thanks for supporting the channel. Thanks for donating

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,440
to the channel when you do. I appreciate everything and I love you all. I'll see you next time.
