00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hello.

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How's it going, guys?

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Good morning.

5
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to type this real quick, then I'll start, okay?

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hello.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I didn't know Arch was co-hosting today. No, no, no.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Arch isn't the furry.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
V is the furry.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What's going on, guys?

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Brent, you're here. Are you here to complain again?

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sorry, guys, I'm the reason I was late as I was talking to an artist.

13
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And I'm just finishing up, you know, detailing the next the next art stuff for the channel. Here's the thing.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I want some new artwork.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You know, the the fat dev with the scrolling background, it's kind of overused at this point, I think.

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I think I don't know if you guys agree, but like it's been around for three or four years now and I wanted something new.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So I decided to put some gameplay footage in.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The in yesterday's video.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And I think like there was a few complaints. Most people didn't seem to care, though, to be honest.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And I think most people just view me as like second monitor content anyway.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So it doesn't matter if I just have random gameplay footage in the background, but I just want something different.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I want I'm still I still I'm still going to use the fat dev with phone artwork for TikTok Tuesdays, but I want something different for the other videos.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I got to figure out what I want to do, because.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Lots of lots of channels use random gaming footage, and I do like random gaming footage behind behind discussions of conversations.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But some people complained about it.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I do watch a lot of commentary slop anyways.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't commentary videos just have random gaming footage anyway in the back in the background?

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Isn't that the case?

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't quite know what the commentary community is, but.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, yeah, the the dev walking up the background for that one covid video, I was intending to do a covid series and I got sidetracked.

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Displayed two random game in the split screen track TikTok.

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh, because here's the thing I like using gameplay footage when I'm talking about like gaming or YouTube being or drama.

34
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Right. Because that kind of feels like it when I did the Skullgirls video gameplay footage was fine.

35
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
When I did the Final Fantasy video gameplay footage was fine. I did a.

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm probably gonna do a video on Capcom soon. And for that just random gameplay, random gameplay footage is fine.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But to be honest, it felt very strange to put random gameplay footage in a discussion about political theory.

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That sound that felt very strange. You know what I mean? It didn't feel right.

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I thought I thought I would like it, but I kind of didn't. But I still want a different. I still want something different for the background.

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I guess the issue is. I'm not sure how much I want to invest in this sort of thing anyway, because I might be radically changing my setup when I move in a few months anyway, because I'm moving come springtime, probably April or May.

41
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So if I radically change my setup and I can actually, you know, let's say I lose some weight and I can actually be on camera and be presentable and not be a fat fuck.

42
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Then maybe I wouldn't even use a background. You know what I mean?

43
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know. I still I still got to think about it.

44
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I know like it's a Gundam alternates between, you know, animations or drawings of his character and also random gameplay footage.

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I think what like I think what it's a Gundam does stylistically is what I would like to do with some of it with some of my videos.

46
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I just don't have the time or the manpower or the patience, frankly.

47
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You become a vtuber. I don't know what that did.

48
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Who knows? Maybe I'll just make like a v tube avatar of just like my fat dev self anyway.

49
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
As for a camera, I mean, I don't know. I've also considered doing more streams.

50
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I mean, the weekly zip is coming up on 200 and I set an informal goal for myself that.

51
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I would change the format of my of my streaming stuff at 200 and my plan, I think my plan was basically just to stream more.

52
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:56,000
All right.

53
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I got like a bunch of ideas and they're all kind of disorganized and they're kind of pulling me all in different directions, you know.

54
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And some of them involve artwork. Some of them involve me getting on a camera.

55
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't quite know what I want to do yet.

56
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Can't accuse Dev of being a tourist who becomes a vtuber.

57
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes, couples are still in the works that will come eventually.

58
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, gameplay footage works better for indefensible. I agree with that. I agree with that.

59
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Like I tried to do it yesterday and I thought I would like it. I didn't like it, you know, so I got to find something else.

60
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I got to figure something else out.

61
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
In fact, you know what, I might even just message Gundam and ask him how he does it, you know.

62
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Like who he got to do it, maybe that'll help.

63
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Coffee's good, guys. Coffee's good.

64
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
OK, what else is happening? What else is going on?

65
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hold on, let's pause this.

66
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah, I'll figure something else. I'll figure something out, I'm sure.

67
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I have like, it's kind of strange because like all the ideas are like half formed and they're all interesting.

68
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But I'm not sure I have enough time to do them all and I want to do them all. You know what I mean?

69
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Do reading footage.

70
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Kefl's did a stream with Chris Chan. It's so over. Thanks for the two dollars, Rusta. Appreciate it, buddy.

71
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, I have I have Gundams like like DMS. I can talk to him whenever I like.

72
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So the almighty loli doesn't like me.

73
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes, like the almighty loli is part of like that, that group of people who did not like the fact.

74
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That that I basically said that V tube simps were simps, so.

75
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh, also, I'm not sure that I'm not sure I know who meant his way this, to be honest, I don't know who that is.

76
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But like, basically, I have like an idea for like a series of different types of content, right?

77
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And so the gaming footage with maybe a bit more editing quality talking about gaming related issues.

78
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
That'd be like one series and then me talking about like the ten minute takes videos.

79
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That'll be like a different series. It'll have like a background or something, right?

80
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And if I can fit all. Here's the thing. Also, I need more staff, right?

81
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Dave does a lot of good work, but it's not cutting it anymore. I need more.

82
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The need to the channel guys, if you don't mind, I would say that like my goal.

83
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
In order to be able to afford to.

84
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:13,000
To be able to afford to move and set up my studio once I move, I probably need another like $10,000.

85
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So that'll be my goal to push towards. Over the next four months or so.

86
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't know, Dave's not going anywhere. They're not going anywhere. I don't mean to say that.

87
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What I mean to say is like, Dave, I need more help than just what Dave can provide.

88
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We donate to does not become a simp. Got it. No diverse simps.

89
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's like you saying they're just like your average Twitch thought that pisses us off.

90
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
A lot of them are. A lot of them just are like the average Twitch thought, dude.

91
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Just simple. That's how it is, dude.

92
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I mean, I can give you the argument that I gave V yesterday. It was a pretty good argument.

93
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I think he ignored it. I think it was a good argument.

94
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Like here. Here.

95
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
OK, I'm going to show you. I'm sure you want to talk about. OK.

96
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So listen.

97
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
OK.

98
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You have Emirates, right?

99
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And she's in her tub with the bathing suit on.

100
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And she's taking donos and she's writing names on her arm.

101
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
For four donations, you have Amaranth.

102
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then you have Dodger.

103
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And Dodger just kind of plays the games that she wants to play whenever she wants to do it in her room.

104
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
She doesn't she doesn't do the Twitch thought thing, but she is, you know, an attractive woman on the Internet.

105
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So.

106
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What's the difference between these two? I mean, there's clearly a difference, right?

107
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Despite them both being attractive women on the Internet who live off of Twitch and who get money from donations.

108
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What's what's the difference between them? You know, there's there's clearly a spectrum of thought and nonthought.

109
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Right. There's clearly a spectrum. And even though you can't cleanly draw the line between the two daughters married, even when Dodger wasn't married, though.

110
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Also, Amaranth is a boyfriend. Amaranth is a fucking boyfriend, dude.

111
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Or is she married now, too? I don't fucking know. The point is, is that even though you have these two extremes, right?

112
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Thought and nonthought and that there's like a gradient between them where where a woman can be like slightly more thought like as they move towards the other pole.

113
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But just because there's a gradient and the line between them is blurry doesn't mean that there's not two obvious ends, right?

114
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Dodger is not simp baiting. That's a big part of it, isn't it? Now, listen.

115
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Lots of V tubers, lots of V tubers, even the ones who market themselves as pure or at least non lewd, they definitely simply they definitely simply.

116
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:26,000
All right. With with the you know, with with the extremely attractive, almost almost perfect picture ask model with the very different, generally higher pitched, generally cuter voice.

117
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
When they get a donation. Absolutely. They absolutely simply simple as that. Simple as that. Right.

118
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And so I mentioned this to V and V said, well, you know, there's also a similar spectrum between like Vash and Hassan and people like me or him.

119
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Right. Which is true because there is this spectrum.

120
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But then I told him, like, listen, you're making my point back to me because you know what happens when Vash gets a donation?

121
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He says, thank you for the donation, comrade. Get ready for the revolution.

122
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We're all going to be out there like like Vash. He's not simp baiting in the same way, like appealing to your deck, but he is appealing to your sensibilities.

123
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
All right. There's this feeling, at least in terms of how Vash talks to his donators.

124
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That he's going to be there with you for the revolution and that you're donating for the revolution.

125
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But I mean, we all know that if the communist revolution comes.

126
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Watch isn't going to be there. You know, Vash Vash's parents worked in Hollywood.

127
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
He grew up in Beverly Hills. He lives in a gated community in San in Seattle now.

128
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Like Vash is going to be on the fucking street fighting with a revolution.

129
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
He's not going to be fucking there.

130
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So this idea that like he like Vash doesn't do the simp baiting in the same way as like appealing to some sexual sensibility or even some like girlfriend experience or some like you have to take care of me because I'm the cute girl.

131
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Like like quasi Tamagotchi experience like like the NPC memes do right.

132
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Vash doesn't do that, but he does appeal to the sensibilities of of his, you know, like his sad communist revolutionary or quasi revolutionary hopeful failed revolutionary audience.

133
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Right. Like whenever I talk to you guys about donating, I appreciate the donations you give me.

134
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But I also constantly say don't donate to me if you can't afford it.

135
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:51,000
In fact, like here there are there are things that I could do to get more money out of you guys that would be duplicitous and would be immoral and that I won't do them.

136
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You understand? So this is what I'm talking about.

137
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
OK.

138
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Hold on.

139
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What's your opinion on Thomas Hobbes? He's all right.

140
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He's right about some things wrong, but other things. Thanks for thanks for the 10.

141
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm sorry. Appreciate it, dude.

142
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Isn't that just appealing to demographic them? Why call it simp baiting?

143
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Because there's a duplicitousness in it.

144
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Like I could I could be here and like every time you guys donate to me, I can be like, yeah, thanks. Thanks, dude.

145
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Guess what? We're going to go. You know what this donation is going towards? We're going to go.

146
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We're going to revitalize centrism. Liberalism is going to be OK. We're going to be like I could or I could even I can even go further.

147
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Right. I know that that a lot of you guys are more right wing than me. I could be like, keep donating, guys.

148
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll turn more right wing if you keep donating. I'll start supporting the alt right.

149
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Or else we're going to the dissident, right, guys, like I'll start like.

150
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:12,000
There's like it would be more sophisticated than that, obviously, I'm just speaking off the cuff, but the point is, is that I could say things that.

151
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Either would be directly false or.

152
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That would be.

153
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That would imply something that I don't mean, but that you would think that I mean, and I would have plausible deniability.

154
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
All right, because lots of streamers do that.

155
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Lots of streamers do that.

156
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
And I don't do that and I refuse to do that.

157
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You know.

158
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You wouldn't know that since you like here, like Lord Boneman, like you're kind of like, why even here?

159
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Are you actually just here to put words in my mouth?

160
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There is an honesty knowing that my money only goes to you. You don't want to be the completionist. Yeah. Oh, fuck that. That's a great example. The completionist. Holy shit.

161
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Probably is a bigger than a bigger than most of you. Do you think so? I don't know.

162
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Here's the thing, right? You have you have like a cute girl, especially if it's a cute anime girl, because then it's unrealistic.

163
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And every time you donate, she squeaks, she changes her voice. She tells you, oh, just how thankful she is for it. And she does a little dance and her model jiggles around.

164
00:18:49,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Are you are you seriously fucking saying there's it's all above board. Nothing's being implied there. Nothing's like there's nothing. There's no subtext to that whatsoever.

165
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Like if you if you're saying that you're fucking coping, right? You're just fucking coping. And in fact, you're probably locked in to being a simp.

166
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And here's the thing, like, because of the way that these online conversations and arguments go, a lot of you guys in like, here, like, like, valiant just did it.

167
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If YouTube are genuine enough by your stand, then they're okay. Yes. Yes, valiant. That's exactly the point. Because here's the thing. I never said all V tubers. All right.

168
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Like, you're unironically doing the hashtag, like I have to do the fucking hashtag not all V tubers thing the way we did like fucking hashtag not all men before because feminists are being retarded about men. And now you're being retarded about V tubers. You understand?

169
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Someone said in the chat, the only vtuber I watch is Pippa, she's called the Vasha horse. It was actually really funny. All right. There are actually V tubers that I like.

170
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But this there's an idea that like, I just, oh, God, people say that, like, dev supported the harassment against pick me. Like, how could you possibly fucking come out with that? Like, you have to be retarded. I hate to just toot my own horn, but it sometimes just seems like, am I am I just like, smarter than the average person online? Is that it? Are most people on the internet? Is that fucking dumb? Or that fucking dishonest?

171
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Like, is that what most humans are?

172
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Fuck. So how's that? Is that my waifu?

173
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But anyway, like, I don't like, I'm not a thought leader, not the head of any sort of political movement.

174
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I certainly can't give you guys a girlfriend experience. I can't say, Hey, if you if you donate to me enough, maybe I'll fuck you. I can't do that. I certainly don't don't make make you guys think that you can care for me like a Tamagotchi by donating, right? All of those avenues are cut off.

175
00:21:35,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The only thing I do is like, you can support me, I'll keep making videos. That's what you get for your support. It's a transaction, right? And I'm not gonna I'm not gonna coach that transaction in any sort of other emotional appeal, whether that is political, or sexual, because I think that's a moral. All right. And in so far, as other streamers do that, lots of women do it.

176
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Lots of politics streamers do it. And lots of vtubers do it. But in so far as they do it, I think that they're acting immorally. And I won't do it. It's as simple as that.

177
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:42,000
What else? What else is happening? Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. So I mentioned, if you guys remember last week, last week, I was like, Dude, getting on the ADHD meds was amazing.

178
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Remember that shit, guys. So I was given one week of 10 milligrams of Vyvanse, and then five weeks of 20 milligrams of Vyvanse. Okay.

179
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Hold on, Brian Linden, $5. Thank you. Now what you need to do to get more money from us is to be wrong on purpose to bait us into arguing. Also, pick me election stolen and died suddenly. Oh, my God. Thanks for the fiber, dude.

180
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:46,000
So so stretching. Oh, okay. So Vyvanse, right. When I was on the week of 10 milligrams of Vyvanse, I felt fucking incredible. My ability to focus was drastically improved. I could stick to writing. I could stick to reading. I could stick to writing.

181
00:23:46,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I could stick to reading. I could actually click complete books in one sitting. I could like I could get on with like writing a long script. No problem. I could actually work. And now, without the Vyvanse, I can work about 30% of the time at that level. With the Vyvanse, it was more like 75 to 80% of the time. It was excellent. And I was like, Yes. Oh, I can finally do all the things that I want to do.

182
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So Dylan Bowser, welcome. Let's get this sip, boys. But the cringe article is the next level this week. Thanks. Thanks, Bowser. Do a long $5.00. Hey, Dev, any plans on doing a deep dive in accelerationism? Catch you on the replay. One day. Yes. Because I don't like accelerationism on either side. So, yes.

183
00:24:35,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Here's the thing. Um, but then after the week of 10 milligrams, it was time for me to step up to 20 milligrams. And on 20 milligrams. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Everything was worse. Everything was worse than then. It was worse than me at baseline, like without medication. It was fucking terrible.

184
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh, my God. It was really bad. It was really bad. So people saying it's math. It's math. It's math. It's like it's related to math, but it's not the same as math. Everyone does the joke. It's math, but it's related, but not the same drug. The nobody care. What's this?

185
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Going tomorrow. Titanium. Why is Biden lesser evil compared to Orange? Mainly because of the Eastman memo. That's the main reason. The Eastman memo is why I think that Biden is the lesser evil compared to Trump.

186
00:25:37,000 --> 00:26:05,000
So here, here, here. Here's Here's the situation here. Titanium knows what's going on because titanium is also on on Vyvanse. So let me describe it to you. Okay. So in general, Vyvanse. Okay. Here's the TLD of how it works. Right. I think I think I said this last week, but I'll say it again real quick this week is that if you have ADHD, you're like looking around, you can't keep your focus on anything because everything is so stimulating.

187
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Right. So basically what you do is it lowers your threshold for no, you know, everything is boring, but that's what it is. Everything's boring. So you're constantly being stimulated by a new thing. So what it does is it lowers your threshold for stimulation. Right. So basically, if you must sit down and do a long job, it takes longer for that job to get boring.

188
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:57,000
It remains interesting for long periods of time. That's that's what that's what the drug does, basically. So the you're able to write and read, and just generally focus on things better and not be sucked in to like constantly snacking every time you walk through the kitchen, right, or get hooked into addictive video games for hours and hours and hours because it has such a strong reward pathway. Right.

189
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
So.

190
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And honestly, a lot of the stuff you can actually just kind of like learn good habits and muscle through on your own.

191
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
But but sometimes you can't get all the way there. So I wanted I wanted to try it. I want to try it. I gave it a go.

192
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I gave it a go.

193
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And so what ends up happening.

194
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Is you have the side effects of high blood pressure, which kind of sucks for a fat guy like me.

195
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
No appetite, which is pretty good for a fat guy like me.

196
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And so on the 10 milligrams, I was doing all the work. It was amazing. My life was measurably improved. I had no appetite, which was good.

197
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And the high blood pressure symptoms were minimal. So it's like, okay, you know, I'll, I'll lose weight and deal with that on its own. Not a big deal. Right.

198
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I didn't experience any loss of creativity, which is a common side effect that I didn't experience. And I didn't experience any any anxiety, which is a common side effect. Okay.

199
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So like, things were perfect. Then I then I jump up to the 20. And on the 20.

200
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
The high blood pressure symptoms were constant and very uncomfortable. They never went away.

201
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
They were just there all the time. And I just felt terrible.

202
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And also lots of anxiety. And I don't have anxiety.

203
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Normally, like without medication, I'm not I'm not a person who ever gets anxiety. I am not an I am not a person who is prone to getting anxiety. But I had it on this. I had a whole bunch of anxiety.

204
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And I was like, Oh, my God. And it doesn't matter that like, my focus was still improved. Like I was a fucking wreck. I couldn't do anything on the 20. And I was like, Oh, my God, this is like, this is fucking. Oh, my God.

205
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:12,000
It was terrible. And so I was like, you know what? I'll keep trying. Maybe maybe I just got to get used to the the 20 mgs. Right? I'll just I'll just keep trying. So I just muscled through it for like three or four days. And it didn't get any better. I was just like, Oh, my fucking God.

206
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:36,000
In fact, one of the reasons why I'm not happy with the editing job on the video that came out yesterday is because I forced myself to edit it while I was in this terrible state. I was like, you know what, I need to get this video out. I just need to fucking do it. So I've just forced myself to just it's like just the bare minimum. Just get all the fucking things on screen. Fuck it. Just just get it out. And I'm not happy with what I did with it. But it's out. Okay.

207
00:29:36,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Okay. Um, so I'm just like, Oh, I stopped. I didn't take any today. I didn't take any today. I'm going the doctors is open tomorrow. I'm going back. I'm going to be like, Listen, put me back on the 10. And that'll be that. However, the only the only issue is that 10 milligrams is not considered a normal dose.

208
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Here, maybe it is somewhere else in the world. But like, 10 milligrams is what you give the children, or it's what you give to adults to eventually boost them up to something higher. It's not considered a dose you should stay on. But so I'm going to tell them though, like, Listen, either you put me on the 10, or I just I'll just take the 20s for you. And I'll just start cutting them in half. Because I'm not doing that again. Fuck. Oh, my God. So here's the issue.

209
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It didn't really screw with my mind. All the symptoms I'm describing are like body or like body symptoms, right? It was like body anxiety. It was all stuff happening in my body, but my mind was pretty much intact.

210
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:58,000
$5 stigma. Thank you. Almost every med I've ever taken that messes with brains have always been at about half the dosage for my weight. Really? Yeah. Maybe I'm just I'm just very sensitive to it, you know.

211
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But yeah, I'm going to try to get I'm going to try to stay at the 10.

212
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:19,000
If they if they say no, we will only give you prescriptions for 20s, then I'll take the 20s and I'll cut them in half. But I'm staying at 10. Fuck that.

213
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So that's what I'm doing. So today, I'm not on any of the medication. And I'm certainly feeling better than when I was in the 20. That's for sure. Also, for everyone saying it was meth. There's like, there's no like, there's no addictive property to this.

214
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Like, I don't feel the urge to like, take the pill or anything. I don't feel I don't feel I don't like miss any of what I was feeling. I'm just like, that sucked. I won't do that again. Like, there's nothing addictive here. You know what I mean?

215
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So I'm just like, Okay.

216
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
All right.

217
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So yes, that's the current situation with me and the drugs.

218
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yet. Yeah, but it's been almost two weeks of me doing this. I figured there'd be something.

219
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I figured there'd be something.

220
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm lucky, maybe because those are slow. Also, to be honest, I never really got addicted to alcohol or weed, even though trying those as well. I tried smoking, didn't get into smoking.

221
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Even maybe I just don't have an addictive personality. Well, to be fair, I do have an addictive personality. But it's towards food and video games. It's not towards any sort of drug.

222
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Devo three years later, I can quit at any time.

223
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
How would you recommend including sleep schedule? Here's what I do.

224
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I open the windows, and I allow the sun to shine into the room as I wake up. And I wake up with the sun. It's quite nice.

225
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I can't wait to take this bill. That's not how it works. I'm not feeling it at all, dude.

226
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I understand titanium, and that's probably what it was. That's probably what it was. But you know what? Right now, I feel better.

227
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Right now, I feel better. I'll go back and get tens, and it'll probably be okay.

228
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So what else do I want to talk about before we start? Well, we're already starting. I mean, I guess this is definitely part of the show, isn't it?

229
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Oh, yeah. I don't know. I think, like, sometimes the amount of haters that I get, and I get my fair share of them, for sure. More so now than before.

230
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Probably because of, like, Pick Me, Trucker Video, all that stuff. But the amount of haters that I get is sometimes disheartening, you know what I mean?

231
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:35,000
And in terms of the pure, raw numbers calculus, it doesn't matter. Like, I can do... Hold on. Jess, I haven't sent dollars. Thank you.

232
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I think with meth is the active ingredient, which is an amphetamine. My friend who takes the meds has to tell how employers this, because drug tests look for the ingredient and flag it as meth. Makes sense. I know what you mean, yeah.

233
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Okay. I do hate or bait sometimes, and sometimes it's really fun, right? But sometimes, like, I'll talk to people and they're just retarded and they want me to agree with them.

234
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And when I don't agree with them, they take it personally. Like, the amount of right-wingers in the past, let's say, year, it's been slowly ramping up over a year.

235
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:22,000
The amount of right-wingers who legitimately hate me because I don't agree with their takes has kind of gone through the roof.

236
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And it's gotten to the point where I do not care to cater to them anymore. I was like, well, fuck you. You know what I mean? Like, it's not just that you gave a take I disagree with. They act like they've been personally attacked by me.

237
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:55,000
No, no. I'm sure it's not me. Yes. And here's why. Because when I disagree with someone, that's a disagreement, right? When I have a take that you don't like, when you have a take that I don't like, we disagree.

238
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay, we disagree. Fine. We disagree. And we can have a discussion and we can go like, okay, well, here's a point. Here's a point. Here's what I think of your point. Here's some proof. Here's some evidence. Here's some numbers. We can have the discussion and work it out, right?

239
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:21,000
However, there are people who I give a take they don't like, and then they morally attack me. Or they say, I can't believe you've changed up, even though I haven't really changed.

240
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Or they'll say, I can't believe you were a liberal dev, even though I've always said I was a liberal. Or they'll make a big show about no longer watching. Right?

241
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And then it's just like, what should I do with this? Like, what should I fucking do with this guys? Like, it's one thing like here. All right. One of my mods, one of my mods is Avalon Apple. And he disagrees with me more than most people. He's constantly sending me shit about why I'm wrong.

242
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And yet I still consider him a friend. And I still take his opinion seriously, even though we disagree. And there's no hate between us. All right. You understand?

243
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Compare that to someone who is like, Oh, this video critiqued my point of view, I need to make a very public I need to make a very public statement about how you don't understand that the West has fallen and I'm on subbing from you. And I can't wait until you're completely destroyed. It's like, what the fuck? What the fuck? What's wrong with you?

244
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That riff person, so we will make their opinions part of their identity and take a person we don't confirm that part of their reality. That's true. That's true. But it's also it's also the fact that there's, again, a weird parasocial thing that some people have adopted. All right, like, and this is why I'm very sensitive about all the people who push the simp shit.

245
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:28,000
From that previous conversation, and why specifically do my best not to push it as much as I can. All right. Because there have been people who have taken it like a personal attack, like I've backstabbed them. Like I've betrayed our friendship, which doesn't really exist, because I like you guys, but like, you're also viewers, you know, you're not you're not like on the same level as Naomi, for example, or Dave, you know, I don't know you in real life. But they think it's like this incredible, like betrayal.

246
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
That I would give a take that criticizes them. It's like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

247
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:56,000
person. Thank you. Some people will make their opinions part of their identity and take it personally. We don't have from that part of the reality. Yep. That's for sure. $20. Some territory. Thank you very much, man. When people start to substitute their, their politics with personality, how else can they take a difference of opinion other than a personal attack? Yeah, exactly. Right. Exactly. And right wingers are doing that, too. Yeah.

248
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Destiny's approach of purging fans every time you get a huge influx to remind them of your actual takes is based. There's like a balance there fable. I agree with you, by the way, the balance is like, you can purge fans. But if you're like, if you're small, and you purge too hard, you destroy your own growth, right? But then you also have the problem of being captured. Like what if it turns out that you give one take that is not in line with your other takes. And now you gained a bunch of people who you don't actually agree with. And they're all following you now. And they're all just ranting at you, because you don't agree with them.

249
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Because you because they thought you were somebody else, you know what I mean? Like, if you're a left winger, and you give one right, one take that right wingers like, and now like 90% of your audience is right wingers. And you have to be like, Listen, I don't fucking believe this shit. And then you're constantly fighting with them or the opposite to like, when a right winger gives a take that left wingers like you know what I mean? So, for me, it's like, I'm a liberal, I've always been a liberal. Liberalism will sometimes agree with the left and sometimes agree with the right. And so when you come in here, and you see, like, if you're a right

250
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:26,000
winger, and you see a right wing take, and you're like, Yeah, devs based. And the next day, I give I give a take against the right, and you like, fly off the handle of like, how you've been betrayed. Like, I just have no patience for that anymore. All right. I have no patience with that anymore. I'm at the point now where it's like, if I were to purge my entire audience, like here, most of you guys are pretty cool, right? Most of you guys are pretty cool. Most of you guys are pretty cool. However, if it turned out that you

251
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:56,000
all went full retard, and I had to purge all of you, and I went back down to being like a 20 viewer fucking politics streamer, I would do that. Because, yeah, if I gotta get another job, I'll get another job. You know, I do not want to be beholden to saying things I don't believe.

252
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:11,600
Like people online. They say I love you a lot. I was stretching Zamze or Zamze. Yeah.

253
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:25,600
Like here, here. I'm gonna show you examples what I mean. I got a few examples because this has been happening like a lot in the past a little bit and I'm just fucking done with it. And since since 2024 is going to be the dev authoritarian year.

254
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:37,760
I'm going to be done with people like this. All right. Hold on. Let me see here. Let me see. Like.

255
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:47,760
Listen, five dollars. I heard you like strawberry ice cream. I'm on subbing and hoping that you lose everything for your insane fruit ice cream views. Rocky road for life.

256
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:54,880
Give me, let me pull this up.

257
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,720
Tara Shevanka, five dollars. And some of you guys are cool. Don't change the stream tomorrow.

258
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:12,560
Okay. Here we go. Like this guy, right? So what's going on here?

259
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:22,480
Is Tim Pool's complaining about has been hotel, right? Oh, hey, Apple's ghost.

260
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,120
Apples, do you wind it? I talked about you recently. Just rewind a bit and listen to it.

261
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,800
There's a low pay five dollars judging by the comments. I feel like you didn't make it clear

262
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,520
in your video that the current liberals aren't liberals, but other progressives.

263
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,480
That's true. Lots of people are progressive liberals, not like classical liberals or social

264
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,200
liberals or conservative liberals. They're progressives. And that's the problem.

265
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,280
And even then, I still have progressive friends because why not?

266
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,000
Photography, five dollars. I'm conservative with you all the time, but I always listen.

267
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,120
I always appreciate your positivity. I'm tired of the doomer right takes. Same here, man.

268
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,360
Clear to clearly come be at two dollars. Deb, become a VTuber with bad A.I.H. art from members.

269
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:10,800
OK, OK, thanks, guys. Thank you. So listen. Tim Pool. Outrage over Amazon

270
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,880
show praising Lucifer. Yeah, yeah, whatever. OK. And then this random fucking person shows up.

271
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,080
I'm talking about something else. And he says, where's the trucker video? All right.

272
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,160
And this happens fucking constantly. All right. And there's this belief among

273
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:31,440
a portion of my audience and also a portion of people who used to be my audience,

274
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,040
but have since moved on. And they think like Dev is avoiding the trucker video

275
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:43,280
because he actually uncovered the truth. And what it is, is that his politics and ideas are wrong

276
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,120
and he can't spin it any other way. So he has to just not talk about it. He can't bring it up.

277
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,880
He has to be. And I'm just like, no, I'm lazy. That's all it is. I'm just lazy.

278
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,120
There's no underlying other explanation. I'm just being lazy.

279
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:06,880
That's it. That's it. Dev, it's a meme. Here's the thing. It's not just a meme.

280
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:17,360
It's not just the meme, though, because I started a counter meme of plus one day. Every time someone

281
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:23,360
mentions the trucker video, I say plus one day. And now we have people who are unsubscribing,

282
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,200
right? Like this guy. And I just said, get the fuck out. Right. And he gave me some long fucking

283
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:32,240
leftist meme. It goes on and on and on like a giant thread about why, you know, Oh my God,

284
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,480
I can't believe I sunk so much time into you. And I can't like, you're like, fuck you.

285
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:43,760
Unsubscribe. All right. Just get the fuck out. Just get out. Like this shit honestly kind of

286
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:49,840
pisses me off. The announcing that you're unsubscribing or like announcing that you're

287
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,360
leaving the stream to go watch somebody else's stream shit like that. It's like, listen,

288
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:02,000
listen, guys, I want you to understand this is not an airport. All right. You don't need to announce

289
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,640
your fucking departure. Just go away. It's as simple as that. If you don't want to, if you're

290
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:16,080
pissed at me and you want to have a conversation about our, about our disagreement, that's one

291
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:22,800
thing, but to declare that I am, I am now moving on. Good. Get out. So look at this

292
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,400
minus one subscriber. I mean, you're not a viewer of mine. You're not a viewer.

293
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,600
Why should I care what you think? There you go.

294
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,400
And yes, here's the thing. Sometimes it is just a meme, right? Sometimes it is just a meme and

295
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,400
that's fine. Like that's okay. We can meme it up, but there are some people who are taking it

296
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,160
serious and I'm just fucking done with them. I'm done with pandering to them. I'm done with their

297
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,680
fucking, their dumb bullshit where they come in and they're always like demanding shit of me.

298
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,800
Get the fuck out. All right. I'm done with it. Antelope, the Greek $2. What do you think of

299
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,080
Georgism? I actually do like Georgism. Georgism is interesting. All right. But I want to do a

300
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,800
video on it someday. So I'm not going to talk about it just yet, but I do like it.

301
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,680
Viewers who try to control the creator. Yeah, exactly. I tell them, I keep saying this shit,

302
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,840
like I'm going to make whatever content I want to make.

303
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,480
Like, and if you, if you don't want to watch it, then don't watch it. That's fine.

304
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:34,000
But I'm going to do what I want to do because it's my channel. And if you don't want to watch,

305
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,240
if it's not for you, then it's not for you, but it's for me. That's, that's the important part.

306
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,200
And like, you see stuff like this pretty, pretty commonly. There's no, I see stuff like this

307
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,640
commonly is what I mean in my fucking comments. Like here, this is, this is the video that I just

308
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:57,200
put out 17 hours ago. Okay. Here's the, it's the new video. And this guy says, I'm sorry, Dev,

309
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:02,320
but you've ever so slowly lost all the qualities I thought made you good over the last few years.

310
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,280
And as a result, I'm unsubscribing. Wish you the best, but I don't want to stay on this ride.

311
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:15,520
I mean, one, I haven't changed. So I don't know what qualities I've lost. I've done the,

312
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,840
I've, I've had the exact same takes and done the exact same stuff this whole time,

313
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,400
but two, okay, just go like, just, just, just, just get the fuck out.

314
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,720
I don't even know what he's talking about here. Like,

315
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,400
is this like a lefty who has been around and he thinks I'm too right wing?

316
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:39,120
Is this like a right winger? Who's like, I don't, I don't even know what fucking side this guy's on,

317
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,440
but it's like, just, just go, just leave.

318
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:54,080
And here's the thing. I'm not even doing the, the total biscuit style ruthless calculus,

319
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:58,880
right? Where I could look at my views. I could look at my subs. I can see they're

320
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,720
both slowly growing over time. Could be faster if I worked harder, but that's on me,

321
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,080
but they're not going down. And it's like, you know what? Even as people unsub from me

322
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,520
and they're saying, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm done.

323
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:17,600
Even as those people go, I mean, they are, they are in, in the total biscuit sense being replaced

324
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:22,640
because more numbers are coming in than are going out. So I'm in no danger, but nonetheless,

325
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,880
I don't want to make that argument because it kind of sounds like too, too calculating.

326
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,960
I simply want to say, I'm going to make what I want. I'm going to say what I want.

327
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:40,160
And, and this shit just pisses me off. Like, what do you expect to say here?

328
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,920
What, what exactly do you expect to influence by saying this?

329
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,960
Think about it. Like, should I beg and be like, come back, dude? No,

330
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,000
I'll change. I'll do whatever you want. No, no, I fucking won't.

331
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:05,920
Hold on. I want to see super chats here real quick. If you talk about the trucker video,

332
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,680
does it add a day? No, no, no. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

333
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,160
video. Does it add a day? No, no, no. It's that's honestly, mostly it's mostly just a troll, man.

334
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,320
I'm just fucking around. I'm Holsteiner. $5. If you'll finish the flaws of liberalism,

335
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,720
excellent work and a great job at the end. Thank you. I don't think they're going to watch it

336
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,440
though. I don't think James Lindsay or Helen Pluckrose even know who I am.

337
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:32,160
Even though it's for them. But yeah, like this one here, this is the first channel I

338
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,480
unsubscribe to. I don't like Trump per se, but this is a step too far. The arrogance.

339
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:44,320
It's like, okay, go away then. Fine. Fine. You know what? This is actually, I think the worst

340
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:50,720
one. I think this is the worst one. This guy's like quit shilling your shitty gaming channel.

341
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,080
Less than 1% of the channel subscribers bother to give a shit. I just tell them fuck off and

342
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,720
stop watching me. That's how I feel about it. All right. Because you know what? I like doing

343
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,960
my gaming channel. The gaming channel gets 50 viewers compared to like the 500 we have right

344
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,200
now. But I prefer it, you know? Okay, hold on. That's the wrong word. I don't prefer it. I like

345
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,760
both projects, but I like, I give them equal weight because I have, I have equal enjoyment

346
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,680
with both of them is what I mean. So people who are like, stop shilling the gaming. Fuck you

347
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,280
get out back. You know what? Here, here, hold on. Let's go to this guy.

348
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:30,320
I just, let's just kick him off the channel. Fuck him. I don't care. Fuck him. I'm, I'm done with

349
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:36,400
people who think that they can, they can continue to control what I do with my channel or my time

350
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,400
by saying, stop doing this. I'm on subbing. You need to say, you need to do, you need to say,

351
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:48,400
fuck you get out. If I want to completely convert this channel into a 100% gaming channel with

352
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:56,480
nothing but let's plays and completely destroy everything. That's that's my prerogative.

353
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:06,480
All right. I'm not going to be told what the fuck to do with my own platform by anyone.

354
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,040
Simple as that. And by the way, you guys should watch the gaming channel or else.

355
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:33,920
I enjoy being successful. I enjoy the donations and the viewers, but I would rather do something

356
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,360
that I truly enjoy with no viewers and no donations than to do something that I hate,

357
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,840
but to have viewers and donations. Does that make sense? Does that make sense?

358
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,080
That's how I feel about it.

359
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:55,680
That's how I feel about it. And I think I'm just,

360
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:06,000
I've reached the limit of dev being a nice inclusive, you know, everyone should have their

361
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,320
say. Everyone should have their take. I'm going to completely respect everyone's free speech,

362
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:15,600
even as you shit on me and try to destroy what I'm building. I think I'm past that point.

363
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,680
I think I'm past that point.

364
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,440
I think I'm past the people who want to somehow like shame me or steer me

365
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,080
or demand that I do something for them. I think I'm past that.

366
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,160
I don't want those people around anymore.

367
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:46,320
Oh, $5 for Holts. Instead of stop doing Paul and just focus on gaming or I'm leaving.

368
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,040
Here's the thing. Zam is my values haven't changed, but like

369
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,720
my experiences have definitely taught me a few things.

370
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:07,760
You know, I ran the discord for since like 2015 as a complete free speech zone.

371
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,600
I did not moderate it. I let people do whatever the fuck they want.

372
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,920
And for a while it was actually really fun because everyone was chill.

373
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,760
But eventually it got to a point where complete fucking retards showed up and ruined it because

374
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,000
in like a pure free speech zone where everyone's being chill,

375
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
if one person steps out of line, the community says, Hey, what the fuck's wrong with you?

376
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,800
Like, stop. Right. And if they're a good person, they'll generally stop.

377
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,720
You know, sometimes they'll sometimes they'll get blocked by some people if they don't stop.

378
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,920
And eventually they learn. Right. But once you start to include people in that community

379
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:51,120
who don't care about social pressure and don't care if they get blocked, then they start to

380
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,000
and they're just like, I'm just going to keep being like a shitty fucking person.

381
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And they do that. And then they start to build up. Right. And they start to invite their friends.

382
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,120
And now you have a group of people who are in the server, who are in the community.

383
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,880
You know, I know, I know, Daddy, I know other people moderated it. Yes, I know. I know.

384
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,760
I understand. But but the rules that I had you guys moderate by were very lax.

385
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,440
You know what I mean? They were very lax rules, like say what you want,

386
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,520
do whatever you want, have fun. But like enough people joined the discord that were just

387
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:31,920
shitty people who did not care about being socially shamed and who did not fit in with

388
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,440
the actual vibe of the server. They ended up creating their own terrible spaces. And what

389
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,200
they would do in those spaces is they would raid other servers. They would raid other people in the

390
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,080
server. All right. They would bully people out of the server by chasing them around to the various

391
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,800
different rooms. A whole bunch of things started happening. And it's because without any sort of

392
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:58,880
moderation, I let the terrible element just grow and grow and grow under the guise of inclusivity

393
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,720
and saying like, okay, we all have free speech. We're all welcome here. We can all have these

394
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:11,520
debates. But then they took that that good nature that I provided. And they basically ruined it

395
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:18,800
with their bad behavior. So that's why that what's wrong with that. What's wrong with that

396
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:24,880
is that all the people, all the shitty people came in and started abusing the other fucking people

397
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,680
in the server. And then it got to a point where they were inviting people who weren't even like

398
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,440
viewers of mine. They just knew. They just knew that like, this is a server that was

399
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:39,200
unmoderated and they could fuck around in it. And I think it was like 2021. I started purging people

400
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,720
and people were like screaming, you can't do this. You can't do this to us. You're a free

401
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,720
speech guy. And I started purging people. And they're like, I never liked you. Anyway. I didn't

402
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,440
even, I don't even know who the fuck you are. I'm just here to fuck around. It's like, get the fuck

403
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,480
out. Right. So basically I got, I got to a point. I got to a point where I was like, you know what?

404
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:07,840
The, the rights of liberalism can be used to destroy themselves if wielded by bad actors,

405
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,400
by evil people or by complete fucking retards. And that's why you see some memes. It's like,

406
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,360
listen, liberal, liberal rights for people who have more than 120 IQ. It's like, you know what?

407
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:22,800
Maybe that's actually the fucking me. That's how it should be. You know? Yeah, it is. I gave them

408
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:32,160
an inch. It took a mile. Yeah. So you know what? You're going to be a new discord server.

409
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,200
It will be open to the right now. It's only open to donators. There is a new discord server.

410
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,600
It is only open to donators. It will eventually be open to everyone down the road sometime,

411
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,040
but this will not be a server that I allow to go to shit.

412
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:52,240
And all the fucking retards and glowies people who are calling for actual violence, people who

413
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,160
are actually bullying people, people who are actually breaking rules, and then crying free

414
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:01,440
speech about it later. None of them will be spared the wrath of dev.

415
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,560
You're good. Then you don't get the fuck out. I don't care.

416
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:27,040
If you don't like the new authoritarian dev arc, then you know what? You can leave. Or you know

417
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,040
what? If you don't like it, you'll probably end up doing something that'll have me ban you. So

418
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:38,640
pick your poison. You can leave, you can get banned, or you can fall in line. I don't care

419
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:47,440
anymore. And no, it doesn't mean that I'm banning critiques or criticisms of me. I'm not banning

420
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:57,520
that shit. I'm banning people who, who are just fucking evil and terrible and who hide it through

421
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,200
like a thin veneer of critique when there's not actually any critique there. They just want to

422
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,640
shit on somebody or people who don't even have the veneer who are just bad. I'm just getting

423
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:19,360
rid of them. Yeah. And cooking and fitness streams to add cooking and fitness streams

424
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,400
to the sub or I'll move. We'll listen to get into Terry Carter's musical threat.

425
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,920
Also how to get on the new server on the old server. If you're in the donator channels,

426
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,600
there's pinned links to get on the new server. So if any of you have donated,

427
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,280
you may come over to the new server. It's already there. It's already available. Yeah.

428
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:45,440
Plato said this in his criticism of democracy. Yes. Democracy, but retards ruin it.

429
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,440
Here's what's in here. $5. I've got two dates, two different poly people this week.

430
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,960
Wish me luck. Oh no, dude, dude. Not the Paulies. Not the Paulies.

431
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,720
Skeptical wave says, Devin, you consider these people newly exist due to the decline.

432
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,960
Listen, skeptical waves. I hate to break it to you, buddy, because I know where your politics go,

433
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,440
but the vast majority of people who I'm describing, they're more right wingers than left wingers.

434
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,240
There are definitely left wingers like this that I'm describing, but none of them would ever be

435
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,560
caught dead in my server. They're all watching vosh and they all think I'm a fascist. All right.

436
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,200
The ones who were in my server are right wingers.

437
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,880
And these are people who are like screaming about like wanting to do legitimate violence

438
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,000
in real life. These are people who are screaming about how they just hate all trans people or all

439
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,760
gay people or all black people. Sometimes they're screaming about like how they want to just bully

440
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,880
everyone else out of the server. They have been bullying people out of the server. Like there's,

441
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:57,600
there's a room where there's specifically meant no arguing. All right. No arguing in this room.

442
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:02,400
This is, this is a room to vent about your daily life and your troubles and how things might seem

443
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,880
home hopeless. It's like the, it is the, we're all going to make it bro's room. All right.

444
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,920
And some of these people would monitor that room and then bully the people who posted in there.

445
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,240
And I am just not going to tolerate that anymore.

446
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:26,480
Nothing. I'm a super chat. Oh, $5. Thank you. We have freedom to achieve our best,

447
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,360
not to mess everything's not to mess things up for everyone. Yes, exactly. Right. Exactly. So

448
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:44,960
another liberal value is is not just free speech, but also free association.

449
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,320
Okay.

450
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,960
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's what it is. Yeah.

451
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,600
Free association is another liberal value. And that's the one I'm going to be leaning on more

452
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,840
because I'm just tired of tolerating people who are fucking terrible. And frankly,

453
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,600
who I look down on and I really don't like and who I think actually make my community

454
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:17,040
when I'm trying to build worse. So they're going, they're all going to go. So by the way,

455
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:22,320
if you are a donator and you are in the old server, the old, the old server will eventually

456
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:29,760
be nuked. So make sure to get yourself in the new server. Okay. A tricky Mario for $5. Thank you.

457
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,320
Articles, please. Otherwise Carlos will punish you with constantly in puns.

458
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:42,080
A devs M bison arc for $5. Thanks. Jiggy calzone. I just wonder why waste your life. Hate watching

459
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,040
funny that it's more common on the right. Left is trying to cancel out of distance.

460
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,720
I have noticed that. Yeah. I think there's a lot of right-wingers who believed that I was

461
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:56,000
a right winger because I critiqued the left. I'm not a right winger. I'm not a right winger. So

462
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:05,840
good to have to try to avoid too much screen time. I already do, man. I do actually go offline

463
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:10,560
quite a bit now. I don't think I missed any super chess. I'm scrolling back up. I don't

464
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:17,440
miss any super chats. Oh, here we go. I did find one. Sorry. Well, isn't thanks for the $5 dev.

465
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,640
Stop doing gaming and just do politics or else I'll take lives and devs walls sublease and play

466
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:31,200
sabaton and weird Al in the evening hours. Oh, I see. Okay. I was old as time. Yep. Yep. Thank you.

467
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:39,840
Thanks for all the super chats, guys. I do appreciate it. I do appreciate it.

468
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:49,760
So, yeah, anyway, I do have some plans with upcoming months that will be that partially

469
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,240
dependent if I get this Vyvanse thing worked out, but we'll see. Right. And the plans do involve

470
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:01,120
getting the weekly sip to episode 200 and then maybe at episode 200 and changing up how I do

471
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:06,720
some things about how I stream. I want to I want to do more streams. All right. I want to be live

472
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,680
more often. I don't want to do and I don't mean I don't mean the gaming stuff. The gaming stuff

473
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:16,720
is the gaming stuff is like a fun bonus at the end of the day, right? I want to be live more often

474
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:23,520
during the day, doing like research streams or politics streams, talking to people,

475
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,840
maybe reading some books or reading, reading court documents, reading papers, you know,

476
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:38,000
I want to do more of that stuff. So I think at some point after weekly sip 200,

477
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:43,760
I'm going to probably end the weekly sip, maybe not end it, but turn it into like a segment of

478
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:50,000
a larger stream and change things up about how I do streaming. I do want to be I do want to do

479
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:57,920
more streams. At the same time, I don't want to give up doing the gaming streams because the

480
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,960
gaming streams I find I find a lot of fun. You know, I like it when when Dave and I hop on the

481
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,680
couch and we play a video game, you know, and most of you guys don't watch that. I'd like it if you

482
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,880
did. But I understand that most of you won't because you're here for politics, not for gaming.

483
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,960
But nonetheless, like I said earlier, I want to do it. I enjoy it. It is a great way for me to

484
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,960
unwind at the end of the day, or playing some Mario or playing some whatever the fuck the game

485
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:27,680
is. And I just I like it. So no, I'd appreciate if you support that. That'd be nice. But I do,

486
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,600
but I'm not going to get just because I'm doing other streams or I want to do other streams

487
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:36,320
doesn't mean that I want to give up the game, the gaming stuff at night. All right. And then like,

488
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:41,920
more streams, which can probably be cut down into stream segments. So basically following the

489
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:47,680
Twitch poll model of doing some streams. And I'll probably upload the stream segments to like,

490
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:52,560
the Devin friends channel. Actually, yeah, that's another one. There was a guy on the deck. Okay,

491
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:59,360
I fucking show you this. Hold on. There's Devin friends, which is where I upload, like my talks

492
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:03,520
with people. Like I do debates with people. I talked to Brianna Wu, I talked to whoever it

493
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:09,520
goes on Devin friends, right? And can I fucking find this? No, it's gone. I think it's gone.

494
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,200
Is it maybe it's this one? Hold on. I'm gonna look for it.

495
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:23,840
Like here, I'll show you another example. Okay. This guy, I am now sufficiently sick of seeing

496
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:28,720
notifications from this channel for ancient videos that I have unsubscribed. I just said good,

497
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:36,240
like get the fuck out. All right. Devin friends is meant to be an archive of streams. And it's

498
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,000
going to be an archive of stream segments in the future. This is what the channel is for.

499
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,560
All right. Fuck, I hate people who do that shit.

500
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:55,040
They've gotten one guy people not even the stream. Yeah, kind of. I watched the gaming stream.

501
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,920
Seeing Dave and Naomi call you retard constantly is fun.

502
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:09,040
You have highlights? Yeah. Basically, the Devin friends channel is going to become like

503
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:15,040
a stream highlights channel. I'll probably move a whole bunch of of old streams over there.

504
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,640
Or maybe I'll leave like, I'll leave some here. I don't know. I don't know how I'm going to

505
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,320
organize it. But basically Devin friends will become stream highlights channel

506
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:25,680
once I start doing more streams.

507
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:36,800
So more streams is a plan. If the gaming stuff ever happens to take off, or at least

508
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,720
slowly grow, that would also be nice because continuing that and expanding that is also

509
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:46,320
the plan. Maybe we're finding some of that. Both of these kind of are predicated on me

510
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:51,520
losing weight though, because I'm like, I understand the appeal of Hassan, he's in good

511
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,880
shape, which is why lots of people watch him. Like I'm, if you ever see me on the fucking gaming

512
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:03,920
channel, I'm a fat blob. I see, I watch you for your sips and whatever commentary videos

513
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,120
you upload. I care very little for the video game streams, TBH. And see, here's the thing,

514
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:12,800
like, like Val Medic, that's, that's your business, right? That is your business, Val Medic.

515
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:18,960
But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop doing them. You know what I mean? Like,

516
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,800
you don't have to watch what I'm putting out, but I'm not going to stop putting out things

517
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,400
that you're not interested in because I still enjoy them. That's what I mean. All right.

518
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,320
And also, yeah, I know, I know daddy editor's coming.

519
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,280
Yes, that's happening. That's happening, daddy. That's coming in the next month or two.

520
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:44,480
Um, hold on. Let me try to find to the example.

521
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,200
Don't ruin your brand. I don't care about my brand. Come on, come on. You fucking,

522
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,560
my NAS is going slow. Just, you know, one guy emote.

523
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,920
I think there already is like a one guy emote on seven TV.

524
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,880
Okay. Yeah. So Dave and I played through lies of P right.

525
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,120
I also want to interact with the community more. Yes. I do want to do

526
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,760
more like Collins or whatever with the community. Yes.

527
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:24,800
Okay. Hold on. I'm here. Okay. Just wait.

528
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:35,280
Yeah. So here I'll, I'll, I'll, this is like, uh, a VOD of one of the gaming streams here.

529
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:41,840
This is lies of P like I'm fat. All right. I look quite fat.

530
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,560
Now Dave looks skinnier than me, but his slouching doesn't help because he like,

531
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,760
he's like a giga sloucher. He's actually taller than me, but I look much bigger than him

532
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,520
because I'm really fat. I'm also more muscular than him by a lot. Like I have a lot of muscle

533
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,640
too, but I'm also really fat and he's just like a sloucher. He's like a, he has like tiny arms,

534
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:06,320
like really like thin wrists, thin legs, and he's a tall guy and he slouches. So like,

535
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:15,440
and also I'm just fat before I can do any sort of professional streaming that has my face on it.

536
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:20,240
I got to lose some fucking weight guys. Like that's just the truth. All right.

537
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,080
That's just how it is.

538
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,560
I still have the flash shirt. Yeah.

539
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:41,120
One of my dad calls you fat. So, so like I got, I got before I can actually do any of this

540
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,640
sort of, um, slouch mask, maxing posture, Chad,

541
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,000
and go do as losing a hundred pounds. I'd like to, you know what I mean? Like, I think before

542
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,400
I can do any sort of streaming with my face on it, like that's, that's more serious than just

543
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:05,360
me being on a couch with Dave. I got to lose weight, got to lose weight because I don't think

544
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:10,000
if I put my face on this stream instead of this artwork, I don't think the stream is going fucking

545
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:22,960
anywhere. Um, go V tuber, make a V tube avatar PC. Thank you for the five gifted memberships,

546
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:29,360
dude. Thank you. Thank you. It flatter cats for $5. Is there a list of games you plan to stream?

547
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,200
Because most of them don't really interest me, but I'd watch, uh, for example, crosscode stream.

548
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:39,280
I mean, I want to play crosscode it's it is on the list, but like we're finishing up sea of stars

549
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:43,440
and I'm probably going to give like, you know, retro new games, a short break before I start

550
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:49,520
the next one. I don't see the game list is like never ending and always growing. You know what

551
01:10:49,520 --> 01:11:00,960
I mean? So yeah, that's kind of the point that I'm getting across here is like my stream plans

552
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:08,000
for both the gaming channel and for this channel, I think just require me to lose weight before it

553
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,640
will ever take off because I think, I think I'm, I think at some level I'm just too gross to watch.

554
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,880
You know what I mean? Um,

555
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,760
I guess obviously, of course, for, of course, for my own health too. Yes. Jiggy. I agree with you

556
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:31,200
on that. Yeah. Um, beyond that, I mentioned earlier dividing up my content into different

557
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:36,800
types of shows because, but I need, I need different artwork and I need, um, I need,

558
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,720
I need different artwork and I need also, I need to figure out how I want to divide it.

559
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:48,240
Basically I have plans, but they're good. They're going to take a little bit of time to set in stone.

560
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:52,000
And honestly, even just having that one good week on Vy Vance kind of showed me what I was

561
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,680
capable of doing. You know what I mean? Because on that one week, man, I got so much stuff done

562
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:04,560
before the, before I up the dose, I got so much good work done so I can do it. I just got to deal

563
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:13,360
with this stuff. I love the current video background with you smiling and all the evil

564
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:18,880
words cycling. It's amazing. I don't know. I feel like I got to update it or something.

565
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:28,800
I think, I don't know. I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out. No new artwork to lose your first

566
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:34,800
10 pounds, maybe. Well, a lot of the new art assets are already coming in. Like the gaming

567
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,840
stream already has new, new art assets. And I'd say about half the new art assets for SFO already

568
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:46,320
in as well. But yeah, that's, that's the plan that I've just outlined. I just outlined my plan for

569
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:52,160
the next few months, more streams, research streams. I'm going to try to basically get the,

570
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:56,640
get the stream stuff locked down for both gaming and non-gaming content. And then try to try to

571
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:01,840
organize the, the video essays because I would love it if like Dev and Friends were a stream

572
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:08,640
segments channel for the streams that I do. SFO still posted like my scripted takes

573
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:18,000
because my scripted takes are, my scripted takes are, they take more time to kind of put together,

574
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:27,600
but it's still doable. And then like anything, anything else is just like kind of fun stuff.

575
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,760
Like the DevKit channel is fun. No one really watches it, but it's where I just do my vlogs.

576
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,280
I just kind of hang out there. It's like, Oh, I feel like talking about this thing today. So I'll

577
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:39,040
do a vlog about it. Or I'll talk about a movie or I'll talk about like a piece of technology

578
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:43,600
I've just tinkered with. Like the DevKit channel is like my personal like channel just for me.

579
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:49,680
You know what I mean? The TF2, dude, the TF2 servers up on the new server.

580
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:57,760
Listen, new discord server has Minecraft has TF2. Things are okay.

581
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,240
Yeah. The evil words meme is getting old in the background. Lots of people,

582
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,760
lots of people don't get it. Yeah.

583
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:14,000
Anyway, I'm just rambling and repeating myself at this point.

584
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:22,400
So never heard of your personal blog. Yeah. Yeah. My personal blog, my personal vlog

585
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:32,880
channel is called the DevKit. Yeah. The DevKit is what it's called. And yes,

586
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,960
sent in. Hi, the new server. The new discord server is linked in the donation,

587
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:42,400
the donation room of the old server. So get yourself in the clay castle. Hey, man, it's

588
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:48,640
been a while here. I'm going to grab some water. Listen, I've now just been talking about like

589
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,840
personal stuff. And like my health and my feelings and my plans for like an hour and a half at this

590
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,840
fucking point. So I'm sorry, it's been so long. But you know what, do you guys want to talk about

591
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:14,240
articles now? You guys want to talk about articles now? Here. I do buy old games and

592
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:20,480
consoles. I also mod them. It's just like a fun side project for me. Here. I'm gonna grab some

593
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:26,320
water. And I'll be back in a second. Okay. It's me a second. All right. Hold on.

594
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:43,120
Also, the new chair is doing very well.

595
01:15:50,480 --> 01:16:12,080
Listen, listen, my long term goal after I move and I have the studio built

596
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:18,080
is that like, maybe maybe just me on my own. Maybe me and a co host will do a show called

597
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:24,240
the daily sip instead of the weekly sip. And what we'll do is I'll just like, I'll stream for like

598
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:29,920
four or five hours and I'll cover articles or news or just research things. And I'll do that

599
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:45,120
like five times a week, something like that. Hold on. Some of the chat says everyone with

600
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,200
their weight loss advice. SFO doesn't want to lose weight. That's why he's trying to

601
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:54,320
hype himself to do it. People get fat for nothing. No, some guy on the internet. That's not how it

602
01:16:54,320 --> 01:17:04,160
is. I do want to get I do want to actually lose weight. It's just I don't have the time to devote

603
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:10,880
to like an hour long workout every day or something. Unfortunately. Bring back the porn

604
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:20,960
star. Bring back Lilith. Okay, sure. Three dollars. Hey, Dev, for losing weight, I recommend

605
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,160
no commitment gym membership like plant fitness. So just make hundreds of equipment. I make it

606
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:28,320
tear it up. I just got a couple of months of dues to make $25 a month. Listen, here's the thing.

607
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:32,560
I've been in shape before. I've been fat and then lost all the weight before. So I know exactly how

608
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:39,360
to do it. I appreciate all the advice, but I know what to do it. I just got to find the time,

609
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:44,880
you know, I think like this desk, you guys have probably heard my desk slowly collapsing over

610
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:50,080
the years. I'm going to buy a new desk when I move. And then once I move, I'm going to have

611
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:56,640
probably a standing desk that like goes up and down. And one of those one of those things where

612
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:09,840
I can walk in place while I do my work. I love that average American class tweet you made a

613
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:14,160
month ago with a picture of Miss Frizzles class. It made me smile. It was funny because people are

614
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:19,280
saying this is an average American class in 2024. Look at how there's no white people in it. There's

615
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:22,880
like a bunch of black kids and like some white kids and there's like some like Indian kids or

616
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,400
Chinese, whatever. Right. And I'm just, I just posted a picture of Miss Frizzles class.

617
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:35,360
Like people are losing it, dude. It's like, why are there so many black people in America?

618
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:40,320
I mean, there have been for a long time, dude, is there anything new fucking weirdos?

619
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:52,000
Did you post those graphs in the economy? Ironically,

620
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,440
the information on them and your claims and what they say don't line up. Yes, they do.

621
01:18:58,560 --> 01:18:59,600
Hold on. I'll pull them up again.

622
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:07,520
They absolutely do. Give me a second.

623
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:17,520
Hold on.

624
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,280
Okay. Where is it?

625
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,020
Okay.

626
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:34,960
I'm pulling them all up. Hold on. I did three tweets that were kind of similar.

627
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:46,240
Three or four, actually. Okay. Yeah. Here we go. Here we go. Okay. So

628
01:19:54,480 --> 01:20:01,120
here we go. Okay. So I'm going to, this is me making fun of all the fucking

629
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:06,960
dissident right weirdos who are, who are talking about this civilization is collapsing.

630
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,520
Everything is crumbling around you. Keep watching those, those TikToks of blacks,

631
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:16,400
kicking the shit out of whites. Let it completely color your perception of the real world that you

632
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:21,920
barely interact with. Take the black pill through my sponsored link. And I posted it with the violent

633
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:27,120
crime rate in the United States. Just going the fuck down over the course of the nineties.

634
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,680
It's mostly leftoids who complain about Biden's violent crime bill.

635
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:36,800
Some rightoids complain about it too, but mostly leftoids, but you know what? It fucking worked

636
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:44,880
like, Oh shit. The Democrats passed a bill in the 1990s that massively curtailed crime.

637
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,840
That sounds pretty fucking good to me.

638
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:57,120
But yeah, like violent crime going down. It's a pretty good trend right there.

639
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:11,280
The second one that I posted, people are saying, like, yeah, you sound like a muscovite during the

640
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:16,320
USSR being comfortable in the main province of the United States. You sound like a muscovite.

641
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:21,280
In the main province, while the rest live in squalor, I have traveled my fair share. And

642
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:25,360
all I see is countries being ruined by mass immigrants and treasonous governments. It's

643
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:30,800
like, okay, well, where's the ruin. Yeah. You've seen TikToks of druggies wandering around San

644
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:34,560
Francisco and said the whole world sucks, but in reality, things are actually getting better. So

645
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:39,520
like here, let's see. So this is violent crime. Same one going down. We've already seen this,

646
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:50,960
right? Here's this one. Real wages rise again as wage growth outpaces inflation. So real wages

647
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:57,360
are wages adjusted for inflation. So if inflation is going up, but real wages are going up higher,

648
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:02,800
you're actually making more money, even adjusted for inflation, right? So for example,

649
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:11,600
there was during the COVID bullshit from here to here, there was a lot of economic problems.

650
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:16,800
All right. Now you might say those economic problems, you know, they were a price we had

651
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:21,680
to pay to deal with the emergency. You might say that the price that we paid was way too high,

652
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:26,960
that it did not deserve that kind of response and that they ruined things. Either way, we're out of

653
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:34,240
that era now. We're past that. And now that things have actually begun to return to normal,

654
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:40,720
things are in fact improving again. All right. Consumer price index, average hourly earnings,

655
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:47,200
real average hour, and then the real average hourly earnings. So yes, real wages are once

656
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:53,520
again outpacing inflation. And then there's, what was this one here? Right. The poverty rate in the

657
01:22:53,600 --> 01:23:01,440
United States. Yeah. So like poverty has gone like up and down. It was, it peaked at 15%

658
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:09,760
in like 93. It went down to like, what is that? 11 and a quarter, went up a bit, went down a bit.

659
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:16,080
And then it was the lowest in 2019. Then this little hump here seems to be the COVID hump

660
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:21,520
of poverty. I don't think it's going back up again, guys. People are like,

661
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,200
we're all living in squalor. Like, are you like, where the fuck are you? Like,

662
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:34,880
I mean, there's less people in poverty then after the fucking 2008 collapse, what do you mean?

663
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:42,800
And then there's this one where like this guy is saying that like, it's so hard for millennials

664
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:49,040
to buy a house. Now you look at this gen Z on track with older generations, homeownership

665
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:55,520
rates. So basically each one of these lines is what percentage of that generation owned a house

666
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:00,800
and at what age they owned a house at. So let's look at the baby boomers. That's like the brown

667
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:09,360
line that goes really far. So something like, what is this? 10, 15% of baby boomers owned a house at

668
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:18,880
age 15 or sorry, age 18. It's now something like, what is this? 60% or 70% of baby boomers owned a

669
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:28,400
house at 40. So that's the baby boomer line, it goes up. Look at gen X, same thing. 10, 15% own

670
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:33,840
a house at 18, at 40. It looks like just slightly less than the baby boomers, but pretty close.

671
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:40,160
Right? The millennial line. In fact, the millennial line actually started off a bit better

672
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:47,760
than the baby boomers and the gen Xers. At 18, a few more of them actually owned houses

673
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:53,360
and their line, like it dips a little bit below here, but it catches back up. So like millennials

674
01:24:54,560 --> 01:25:00,080
at age 40 are pretty close to the other generations in terms of their house ownership rates.

675
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:07,040
Right. And then gen Z, gen Z started even higher and they're actually doing okay so far too.

676
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:13,840
Right. There's the line. So there's this perception of the economy as being completely

677
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:20,640
and utterly fucked beyond repair and everything's collapsing. Everything's terrible. There's rampant

678
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:25,760
violence in the streets. And I think a lot of this is honestly just pushed by social media because

679
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:31,520
you're scrolling all day, seeing viral sensationalist clips of like druggies wandering

680
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:37,840
around the streets of San Francisco in a haze, or you're seeing like these, like just like random

681
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,640
violence of people just fighting in the street. Right. And Oh, especially if you follow that one

682
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:47,760
guy who posts only black on white violence clips, if you follow him, you think there's a race war

683
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:56,240
going on. All right. But in actuality, things seem to be pretty much in line where they should be.

684
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:02,560
Right. Like it seems like millennials are owning homes that are at roughly the same rate

685
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,920
as previous generations. Crime seems to be going down.

686
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:11,280
The economy seems to have recovered. Like all the numbers that we can pull up and look at,

687
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:18,720
they don't show, the numbers don't correlate to what people are feeling. People are feeling,

688
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:24,720
people are feeling like in their guts that a collapse is coming, but the data doesn't show

689
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:29,600
the collapse. So there's two possible interpretations of what's going on here.

690
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:35,120
One interpretation is that there is no collapse and people are just fucking

691
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:39,920
schizoids because they spend too much time on the internet. That's possible. Another

692
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:46,640
interpretation is that there is actually a collapse, but it's somewhere that our data

693
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:50,960
can't see. And we have, and like, for some reason, it's like a collapse coming in from

694
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:56,400
a novel direction that we're not studying, or we don't understand and people's intuition can

695
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,880
pick up on it, but we just don't know how to, how to capture it and understand it in any sort

696
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:11,280
of reasonable way. All right. So it could be, it could be either of those situations.

697
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:19,600
Artemis Fowl says, this seems like an intellectual failure to understand data. How so Artemis,

698
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:26,800
how so? Or they're lying. Okay. Here's the thing. If you want to say that they're lying,

699
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:31,600
um, Avalon, you can say that, but now you have to, now you have to like prove a whole

700
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:36,000
bunch of other shit for me to accept that because these come from multiple institutions

701
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:43,200
that do not, they're not, they're not all the same power block. All right. If like different

702
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,800
governments and different universities and different institutions are all saying,

703
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,760
this is probably the case. You need to, you now need to show that they're all lying.

704
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:10,240
Let's see what else? Hold on. I'm still scrolling here. I mean, let me grab all the,

705
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:16,960
all the supers titanium for $5. I think doing the research stream is once a week

706
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,520
is a good start to start building the habits now. Possibly. Yes.

707
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,920
Um,

708
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:31,440
$10 from snartigan. Thank you. People want to feel like things are worse than they actually

709
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:35,920
are. So they can justify misery and learned helplessness. Internet induced mental illness

710
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:42,960
is the real crisis. Yes. Yes. I absolutely think that's the case. Start again. I think lots of

711
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:50,160
people, they fucking suck. All right. They're sad. They're sitting inside. They're scrolling

712
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:54,400
on their phones all day. They have nothing going for them. They can't get a fucking girlfriend.

713
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,960
They can't hold down a fucking job. Their life sucks. They're like 35 living with their parents.

714
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:05,440
And they're just like, this is someone's fault. It's gotta be if they're, if they're leftist,

715
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:09,600
they'll say the bourgeoisie. If they're rightists, they'll say the globalist elite,

716
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:14,400
but they're saying basically the same thing. It's gotta be the man keeping me down. It's like, no.

717
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:20,000
All right. Like just deal with it yourself or deal with, deal with it yourself.

718
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:25,280
Like maybe you should solve your own fucking problems before you start

719
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,760
talking about how the entire world's out to get you.

720
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:39,200
Artemus Fowl, $5. That graph really means nothing to have real wages increasing 0.5%

721
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:43,600
after falling 23% doesn't leave people in a better position than when they started.

722
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:49,520
Yes. Okay. So I understand this point of view. The issue is that you can't really go back, right?

723
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:55,120
So for example, when people talk about, I know this is not what you're saying,

724
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:58,640
Artemus. I'm just using this as an example. Okay. People talk about inflation, right?

725
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:04,320
Inflation was 8% during, during COVID lockdowns. And now inflation is back down to 2%.

726
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:08,240
And it's like, well, there you go. Inflation has decreased, but people are saying,

727
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:13,920
dude, dude, but the prices are still high. It's like, you can't go back. You can't go through

728
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:20,880
a deflationary period of negative 8%. All right. Cause like inflation would fucking,

729
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:25,760
they fucking sucks, but so does deflation. All right. You can't actually have the prices go back

730
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:34,560
because basically both inflation and deflation cause their own economic problems.

731
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:40,160
And it's better to not move at all. All right. It's better to have, to have your, your dollar

732
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:46,800
relatively, relatively fixed and set and things are good. But if you go through an inflationary

733
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:52,880
period, it would cause more damage to then go through a deflationary period

734
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,600
to get back to where you were. It's actually better to stop and stay where you are.

735
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,720
Yeah. Inflation is a rate of change. Yes.

736
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:08,720
This guy who just chatted is what I'm talking about. He says, wait, wait, wait. Inflation

737
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:18,960
does not go down. Yes, it does because inflation isn't the price. Inflation is the rate of change

738
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:24,880
of the price over time. Right? So if something costs a dollar and then you go through some

739
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:33,520
inflation and now it costs $2 and then it stays at $2 for like 10 years, what that means is inflation

740
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:47,200
has stopped. Yes. But anyway, talk about what I was saying. Yeah. Like it does suck that we

741
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:52,720
went through this, this period of contraction because of COVID and you can argue whether or

742
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:57,040
not that was necessary. That's a different conversation, but it happened. And now we're on

743
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:02,320
the, we're now on the upswing again and starting to recover. If your argument is that we haven't

744
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:08,960
recovered everything we've lost during COVID yet. That's true, but we will. I'm actually quite

745
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:15,840
confident that we will give it enough time. I have read plus sized alpha manga. Yes, I have.

746
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:23,840
I like it. It's funny. I'm not claiming we had deflation. I'm claiming that we shouldn't have

747
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:27,680
it. And that people who want prices to go back down to what they were before are they, they want

748
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:34,160
it. Um, tricky Mario for $5. Thank you. I'm a game show fan too. And I've seen plenty of

749
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:38,560
black contestants in the seventies and eighties game shows on other minorities. Yeah. Like

750
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:46,000
you can't say this about Europe, but America has actually always been a multi-ethnic nation

751
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:51,040
since its founding in this idea of we want it to be a white nation, like fucking stupid.

752
01:32:52,000 --> 01:33:00,880
Uh, what else? Let's see here. What's the other super chats. Let's take a look at them.

753
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,760
$5 from wonderful galaxy inflation rule 34.

754
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:15,760
Thanks dude. Anonymous coward for $5. It could be a recession in an industry specific areas.

755
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,920
Tech is a bloodbath right now with mass layoffs and high supply of workers on and offshore.

756
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:23,680
Oh yeah. There's definitely that too, right? Like we've been seeing like all those tech companies,

757
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:29,920
just like shedding people like Twitch is shedding people and Amazon and, and what was it like

758
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:34,880
LinkedIn just fired some people like a lots of tech jobs are going away right now. But honestly,

759
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:39,600
a lot of them are useless jobs. A lot of them are just like the, that fucking Instagram girl

760
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,760
who does nothing all day, right? A lot of them are just useless, shitty jobs. And it's probably

761
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:49,360
better that they go. He sent me a stream labs. Let me go take a look at it. Artemis.

762
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:52,400
Thank you as always. Artemis. Thanks.

763
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:09,120
I'll load it in. Hold on. $5 from Tara. Shevanko proposition. You get 8% deflation,

764
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:13,120
but your 401k crashes 50%. Was it worth it? Probably not.

765
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:16,880
Um, dr. Diddler to to horror. Stop talking about your sick inflation.

766
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:25,120
$5 and living does walls. I live with a fat Canadian gamer has goat ridden man server

767
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:31,120
and his genocidal child bride. This is clearly society's fault. Billions must need $5.

768
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:37,360
Starting in every time shoe says line go up world more good or I feel like ceiling. Yes,

769
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:42,240
growth is good. See people. When people do the line go up meme, they're generally talking about

770
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:47,760
like GDP, which is not good. Like GDP doesn't matter because GDP is like, you can have a

771
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,960
suffering population and GDP can go up. Right. So GDP is not, is not the line you should look at.

772
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:58,080
There are other lines, but those lines are going up too. All right. Like child mortality going

773
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:03,920
down, you know, worldwide poverty going down poverty in our country is going down. All right.

774
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:08,960
Violent crime going down, war going down. All right. So many things are actually better than

775
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:16,080
they were just, and yeah, it's, it's slow. There are setbacks. Sometimes there are setbacks that

776
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:21,520
take hold that like that, that, that last whole generations, but things are actually getting

777
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:31,440
better. Okay. Like calm down and fucking doomers. Things are okay. Wonderful galaxy, $5. I'm stupid.

778
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:40,480
Why is deflation bad? So deflation is bad. Deflation is bad because it incentivizes you

779
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:45,120
not to spend your money. Right. So for example, let's say that you have a hundred dollars

780
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:52,160
and with a hundred dollars, you want to buy. Oh, fuck. You know, here, hold, let's say you have

781
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:59,200
a thousand dollars with a thousand dollars. You want to buy a TV. Okay. And you're like,

782
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:02,640
I'll buy the TV. But if you're in a deflationary period, it's like, dude,

783
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:08,960
the TV is price will drop by like a hundred dollars in six months because of deflation,

784
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:14,000
because, because prices are going down because money's worth more, you know, as, as inflation

785
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:20,160
goes up, money's worth less as deflation goes up, money's worth more. So it's like, I shouldn't

786
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:26,400
spend my money right now because I can get that the same thing for less money in six months.

787
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:30,640
So I'll just hold on, hold on my money. Right. And so everyone holds onto their money.

788
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:34,480
And now you're in a situation where like, if deflation is high enough,

789
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:38,880
it completely disincentivizes any form of spending. So it's like,

790
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:43,840
you know, I, I have, I have these, these business needs, right. I got to replenish my tools,

791
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:48,080
replenish my whatever, but you know what, those tools and materials and supplies,

792
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:51,600
they'll all be a lot cheaper in six months. So I'll just push through and just

793
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:57,200
make do with it. All right. And then what you have is if you're going through deflation,

794
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:02,080
what you have is people are now buying less things, which means that the, the,

795
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:06,000
the producers of those things, they don't have to produce as much. Right. It's like, well,

796
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,160
shit, no one's buying our products. You know, no one's buying the TVs we're making. Fuck. I

797
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:14,720
guess we've got to, we've got to produce less TVs, which means less income for them, which means you

798
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:17,760
got to lay people off because now people there's not enough work for people because you're not

799
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:25,200
making as much stuff. Right. And so you can actually enter into a deflation spiral where

800
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:31,440
your economy completely stagnates. No one's making anything anymore. No one's buying anything anymore.

801
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:39,920
And no one has any jobs. Right. So deflation has its own set of bad things. If that goes too high,

802
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:44,800
just like how with inflation, you have, if you have runaway inflation, now your money's worth

803
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,560
nothing. Everything's like the prices and everything are sky high. You can't afford

804
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:55,440
anything anymore. Like both, both inflation and deflation have their own problems.

805
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,280
Okay. What else? What's next?

806
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:12,160
Artemis $10. Let's see. CPI is a highly manipulated figure and has almost zero

807
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:16,640
transparency. How it factors its values doesn't account for a shrink inflation that is obviously

808
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:21,760
happening. Don't put faith in graphs that mean nothing. At the very least, you will have to

809
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:26,080
provide me with something else to counter at Artemis, but thank you for the $10. I do appreciate

810
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:34,480
it. $5 deflation. Isn't bad. No, it is lower gas prices, increase the economic growth of a nation

811
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:40,880
inflation and deflation are natural and happen all the time. Yes, they're okay. Something being

812
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:45,600
natural doesn't make it good. That's a dumb argument. All right. Inflation and deflation

813
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:49,680
do happen all the time, but there's negative effects to too much inflation and there's

814
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:56,400
negative effects to too much deflation. All right. The gold standard is fucking retarded.

815
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,960
Jesus gold fucking standard. Okay.

816
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,920
There we go. Yeah. The deflationary spiral.

817
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:18,880
The great depression was regarded by some as a deflationary spiral. Oh, wow. Okay.

818
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:25,440
See, I wanted to look up an example of it, of a deflationary spiral because I knew Japan had one

819
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:33,200
at one point. I didn't think it'd be the great depression, but okay.

820
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,440
But no deflation can be bad. Yes.

821
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:46,480
Um, yeah, I'll, I'll grab your, your, uh, your other super chat Artemis. Give me a second here.

822
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:55,200
Cocaine is natural. So it's good for you. Thanks dude. Where's the fuck? Where's the

823
01:39:55,200 --> 01:40:14,080
fucking Artemis for $5 says inflate these balls in your mouth. Fuck you.

824
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:19,600
Deb, you definitely have time to work out. I doubt you are doing anything when you first wake up

825
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:34,960
my dude. Um, I'm adding up all my time. A lot of my time is spent on putting together stuff

826
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:44,080
for articles or no, no, for videos, but it's not properly utilized primarily because of the ADHD

827
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:51,920
symptoms, which that one week on 10 milligrams of Vyvanse actually helped a lot. I think with

828
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:56,480
better organization, I'll be able to like cobble together extra time to do a lot of the things that

829
01:40:56,480 --> 01:41:06,880
I want to do. But right now I'm a disorganized mess. I need to work on that first, but listen,

830
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,800
thanks. Thanks very much for everything.

831
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:22,880
Agarizer they're both bad, but let's only let them do the one that hurts the little guy

832
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:27,360
and makes mega property holders better off. Are you a communist? Are you complaining about the

833
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:35,280
Bourgeois Sean King $5. I now mostly only listening to you and what if all tests because

834
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:38,240
the amount of autistic research you guys do. Well, thank you very much. Yeah.

835
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:45,120
Sammy G $10. Every time I hear a dev talk about weight loss is mine. A little LOL. If you're

836
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:48,880
really serious about fixing your health, I have way better advice for you than some influencer

837
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:55,440
and no exercise needed. Well, Sammy, wait, where are you? I'm going to moderate. I'm going to add,

838
01:41:55,440 --> 01:42:00,080
wait, is this you? Sammy? Okay. No, there you are. Sammy, listen, Sammy.

839
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:09,120
I understand like the gut flora stuff, because that's something you research, right?

840
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,800
Well, I mean, fine here, you know, I will take you up on it. Fuck it. Let's do it.

841
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:20,480
Let's do it. Toss me a DM in Discord, Sammy, and we'll and we'll do it. Okay.

842
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:31,520
Just eat tapeworm eggs. Yeah, that's what I'll do.

843
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:36,960
That's what I'll fucking do. Same even in Discord. Hold on. I'm gonna look it up.

844
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:47,360
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Sammy.

845
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:53,760
Are you not even in the fucking discord?

846
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:08,640
Here, hold on. I have Dr. Diddler on Discord and aren't aren't Sammy and Dr. Diddler.

847
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:18,400
Friends. Because you just put me in a group. You can't figure out this girl. Are you serious?

848
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:27,440
Are you an old lady? Okay, hold on. I'll DM you on Twitter. Okay.

849
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:37,600
There is a new discord for my community because the old one is shit and full of fucking losers.

850
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:43,760
I'm making a new one. We have Sammy's a Zoomer. That's right. Zoomers can't do technology.

851
01:43:48,960 --> 01:44:06,240
Okay. Here. You know what? Even though the new Discord is Donator only,

852
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:15,360
I'll DM Sammy an invite to the new Donator only Discord for free.

853
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:22,720
Nepotism is happening, guys. Nepotism is happening. Live on stream.

854
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:28,320
Hold on. Where's the invite?

855
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:37,920
And how do you get the fucking invites?

856
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:46,400
I'll just copy the one from over here. Hold on. See, I also don't know how things work.

857
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:50,880
I also don't know fucking how things work.

858
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:04,880
Okay.

859
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:17,200
Listen. Okay. Here, Sammy. I've pasted it to you. There you go. So listen. Listen. Listen, kiddos.

860
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:29,600
Here's what's going on. Dev, that's unfair to others. Sammy's my friend, though. It's okay.

861
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:37,440
Listen, for those of you who have like a recurring $5 donation through Twitch or YouTube or Patreon

862
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:47,120
or Subscribestar, then you then you get into the Donator room in the old Discord. And the

863
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:56,880
Donator room in the old Discord has a link to the new Discord. But the article's not

864
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:02,480
the articles I've given you, Dev. Artemis, you're giving me so much shit. I don't know what...

865
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,640
I have like 200 fucking messages from you I still got to get through.

866
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:16,960
Here. I do have my own articles you can talk about. You want to talk about those?

867
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:22,160
Is it articles time, guys?

868
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:38,400
I have not heard about the Moamax nonsense. I know that like Stardust is covering it and

869
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:47,520
Treadlogic and everyone. I know they're all covering it, but like I haven't been following

870
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:51,840
the drama. I'm sure it's fucking hilarious, though. I'll go back and look at it when it's

871
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:57,600
all been wrapped up, I think, and get the full story all at once. Also, Sammy, you're

872
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:13,360
you're not even talking in DMs. Anyway, the new server, the new Discord server,

873
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:18,720
is Donator only for now? Donator only for now?

874
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:25,600
It'll be open eventually. Artemis says, don't ask for evidence if you're not going to look

875
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:30,720
at rebuttals on the stream. Oh my god, fine, you fucking autismo. Give me a second.

876
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Yeah, all the shit. Okay, okay, let's see. Let's see, let's see. What is it?

877
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:47,760
Read Sammy's advice as an article.

878
01:47:54,880 --> 01:48:01,120
Okay, let's see, let's see. Let's read it. Let's read the article that Artemis has given us.

879
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:09,840
Is the US purposefully opinion piece? So this may or may not be the truth.

880
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:17,440
Oh, wait, Sammy, you can't have more than one tab open? Oh my god, okay, listen.

881
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:23,120
Is the US purposefully, wait, bro, get to the articles already. I'll do whatever the fuck I want.

882
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:28,880
Is the US purposely under reporting inflation? It's hard not to wonder when you look at how

883
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:36,800
it's calculated, okay. How a 400% increase in the price of a TV ends up being a 7.1% decrease

884
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,520
according to calculations in a department of governance. Okay, let's see, let's see.

885
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:43,200
Let's see how this works.

886
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:50,240
We're living in a world where people seem to relish in the consumption of misinformation.

887
01:48:51,120 --> 01:48:55,200
That is different versions of reality and alternative facts. Some of the stuff people

888
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:59,680
believe is beyond loony. For instance, it's easy to dismiss the truly wacky stories from

889
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:03,920
the QAnon world about politicians and Hollywood elites drinking the blood of babies.

890
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:10,560
It's very, to be fair, I think a lot of the right ways that I talked to you would believe this,

891
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:21,680
though. It's very, bully Sammy, everyone bully Sammy. Wait, Sammy, here, I'll call off the

892
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:30,000
bullying against Sammy if you draw more dev fan art. I have to siphon at least 5% away of your

893
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:34,000
I have to siphon at least 5% away of your attention from Adam and Sitch.

894
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:39,920
Okay, it's very difficult, however, to detect the deception that takes place when government

895
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:44,240
agencies report on matters related to the economy. So difficult, in fact, that most

896
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:49,920
economists don't even understand it. Never mind the general public, okay. One of the most damaging

897
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:54,880
deceptions emanates from the methods used by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics calculation of the

898
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:59,760
consumer price index. The reported CPI is currently running at just under 7%,

899
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:05,680
annualized. You might be surprised to hear that the number would be close to 15% if the BLS used

900
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:12,880
the same formula it did in the 1970s. So this might be the case, but it also might be the case

901
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:19,280
that they changed because the new formula is more accurate or appropriate than the old one. This is

902
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:24,640
implying that they're trying to hide it by changing the formula, but it actually might not be the case

903
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:29,840
at all. Schnitzel says, I'm not a YouTuber anymore, I'm just Schnitzel. Well, hey, Schnitzel,

904
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:32,000
welcome back, buddy. Thanks for the two dollars.

905
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:41,200
At some point in the 1990s, the US Congress decided the old formula needed updating,

906
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:47,120
so they introduced several methodological improvements. In fact, over the past 30 years,

907
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:52,240
they have changed their methods of calculation 20 times. Making any sense of their approach is

908
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:57,280
impossible as the BLS does not disclose the raw data it uses in its formulas. In the art of

909
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:02,880
illusion, keeping a secret is the greatest sleight of hand. Okay, so this is Flare.

910
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,240
It probably would be good for them to disclose raw data, I think.

911
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:12,400
But also, again, changing formula does not necessarily mean that it's bad.

912
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:26,160
Every 20 pounds dev loses, I draw fan art. Okay, you know what, Sammy? I'll talk to you

913
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:32,560
after the stream about it, okay? $10, Sean King. I was talking to my professor the other day,

914
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:36,320
either of you who has a PhD in gut flora. He said they recently concluded that your

915
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:39,360
gut flora has light to no effect on your weight. Oh, okay.

916
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:46,400
Okay, the changes fall into two broad categories. First, adjusting prices based on what the BLS

917
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:51,440
refers to as hedonic changes in quality through innovation, where the consumer derives additional

918
01:51:51,440 --> 01:51:55,600
pleasure from a specific product such as its computer, TV, or appliance, results in reducing

919
01:51:55,600 --> 01:52:03,600
or eliminating the real life price increase. Okay, so I think what this basically means is like

920
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:10,160
the next model of TV is worth more, but it also has more features that people like.

921
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:14,880
So the price to feature ratio remains the same. That makes sense?

922
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:23,200
The approach they use is so complex, even Stephen Hawking would have difficulty deciphering it.

923
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:27,520
As an example, the following is the BLS's own attempt at an explanation of their approach

924
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:32,240
when calculating the hedonic value improvement of a TV set. Okay, let's see.

925
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:39,440
Item A is a television that is no longer available and it has been replaced by new item television B.

926
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:47,040
The characteristics in bold differ between the two TVs. There is a large degree of quality change

927
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:57,280
and there is a very large, 400%, difference in prices of the TVs. Rather than using the 400%

928
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:02,560
increase in price between item A and item B, the quality adjusted rate of price change is measured

929
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:10,560
by the ratio of the price of item B in the current period, $1,000 or $50, over an estimated price of

930
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:19,120
item B in the previous period. That makes sense, yeah? Like different eras, the TV comes out,

931
01:53:19,120 --> 01:53:24,640
different prices and qualities, so you take what you know about stats and go back in time and say,

932
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:30,640
this TV would be worth this much at this point in time. I hate extra features, I hate extra,

933
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:38,800
okay, okay, snare it again. To derive the estimated price of item B, we use the following

934
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:47,600
equation, where PB T plus S minus one is the quality adjusted price, PA T plus S minus one

935
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:52,240
is the price of item A in the previous period and is the constant E, the inverse of the natural

936
01:53:52,240 --> 01:53:56,960
logarithm, exponentiated by the difference of the summations of the B's for the set of

937
01:53:56,960 --> 01:54:00,960
characteristics that differ between items A and B. The exponentiation step is done to

938
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:05,440
transform the coefficients from the semi-logged form to a linear form before adjusting the price.

939
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:17,280
So like this isn't so complex, this is like high school level math guys, like it's definitely like

940
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:22,400
grade 12 level high school math, but still like, how do you understand this?

941
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:32,160
Because what they're doing is they're saying, okay, TVA came out in 2010, TVB came out in 2020,

942
01:54:32,160 --> 01:54:36,240
here's their prices, here's their feature difference, all right? Now with the price

943
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:41,680
and the feature difference between the two TVs and also the rate of inflation, you can now calculate

944
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:48,480
what TVB would have been worth if it came out alongside TVA. Once you calculated that,

945
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:50,720
you look at the difference, now you know inflation.

946
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,280
It makes sense, this makes fucking sense.

947
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:02,960
Nothing confusing about this, nothing's wrong with this.

948
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:17,040
Okay. A TV that has gone up in price by 400% is reported in the CPI as going down in price by 7%.

949
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,200
Tell that to the average salaried worker who just had to buy a new TV set while his salary

950
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:27,840
hasn't increased in years, he couldn't care less. At the end of the day, it still represents a

951
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:32,880
bigger chunk of his paycheck, as they say in the software world, garbage in, garbage out.

952
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:42,880
So I don't know, man, because yeah, you don't got to buy, if you're a poor guy who has to replace

953
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:50,160
his old TV, you don't got to buy the TV that it has a 400% price increase on the actual number.

954
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:56,320
What you can do is just go buy the cheaper TV. It still exists. Buy a lower end TV that's

955
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:59,760
more in line with your fucking budget. God, this is stupid. All right.

956
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:15,760
Dev, you can't question these things. If they say it's too complicated for you,

957
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:23,520
it's too complicated. That's what Forbes taught me. Nah, man, this is dumb.

958
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:34,800
Ah, like the fact that this makes sense and is not actually them like hiding the true inflation,

959
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:38,560
but it's like, oh yeah, different, like you got to calculate inflation by looking at like

960
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:42,320
different products and like their differences. And when they came out in different prices and

961
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:45,520
the kind of, you kind of eyeball it by calculating it all together. Like,

962
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:47,840
yeah, that seems reasonable to me. What's the problem here?

963
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:56,000
Okay. The other calculation method used by government statistics is substitution. Put simply,

964
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,880
if one item in your basket goes up in price, they can choose to change the item to one in

965
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:07,440
a similar category. Take meat products as an example. If beef prices go up, they can substitute

966
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:11,680
with chicken. That sounds kind of ridiculous, actually. Yeah, that's kind of dumb, isn't it?

967
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:16,000
If chicken prices go up, why not try some ham, cheddar instead of Swiss cheese? You get the

968
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:22,160
picture. The inflation of protein products may explain why spam canned meat sales have recently

969
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:28,160
have hit a record high for the seventh year in a row. So if they're doing this, this I think is

970
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:34,640
actually shadier saying we're not, we're going to like just get a different product that looks close

971
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:39,520
enough. And we're not going to do any of those balancing act they did here. This actually looks

972
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:43,120
shady. I don't like this. If this is, if this is how it's actually happening, I don't like this.

973
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:52,320
Thumbnail is furries talks about inflation and this checks out.

974
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:02,560
The way the weighting of items in the CPI basket also produces a distorted picture of the cost of

975
01:58:02,560 --> 01:58:05,920
living, especially for lower income groups. As an example, food and beverages represent only

976
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:13,120
50% of the index. Okay. Meat, poultry, fish, fruits, and vegetables and represent a combined

977
01:58:13,120 --> 01:58:17,920
3% of the index makes you wonder where the BLS people expect people. Oh my God. Well, no,

978
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:24,640
because food represents this much because there's other things to buy than food.

979
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:34,560
Dev your explanation would make sense until you realize the CPI chooses items arbitrarily in

980
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:38,480
order to produce a negative CPI comparable substitution at every level. They can make

981
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:42,880
these changes. Zero transparency says Artemis for $20. Thank you very much.

982
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,680
Well, let's keep going with the article. You sent

983
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:52,640
items in the basket, such as travel or not in your budget in 2021 alone,

984
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:57,200
rents have increased 18%. And as most of us know, from going to the grocery store,

985
01:58:57,200 --> 01:59:00,080
all food items are going through the roof, sugar, corn, wheat, coffee,

986
01:59:00,080 --> 01:59:04,560
here. Here's the funny thing with this. All right. All of you guys in America screaming about the

987
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:08,960
free market. We're libertarians. You want a free market? You want a free market is

988
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:16,800
the free market is your landlord can raise your rate, your rent 18%. You know what my rent got

989
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:25,200
raised last year? Like 2%. You want to know why? Because you don't have a free market

990
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:32,000
in renting here. You know what we have? We have state mandated rent control on all rental

991
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:37,360
properties that only allows them to increase rent alongside inflation.

992
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:58,640
My rent got raised 45%. Damn. That sucks, dude. Yeah. In Canada, all rent is pegged to inflation.

993
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:08,160
Like the initial rental price, the initial rental price is basically like they post the prices,

994
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:13,200
what they think it is. But after you've moved in, you have a right to basically

995
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:19,840
only have rent increased by so much in line with inflation. And that's fucking based.

996
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:38,080
Nationalized land equals free. No, no, no, no. Oh, fuck. God, you're not hearing what I'm saying.

997
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:46,800
Your landlord owns the place that he rents to you, right? And the government does not control

998
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:53,280
how much he can increase his rent on you, right? So he'll increase it 18%

999
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:57,760
and you free market cucks will like it. That's the free market.

1000
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:04,080
Mandatory 500% rent increase to all single mothers based.

1001
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:08,640
$2 from lives and does walls. Thank you, man. They're gonna try raising rent.

1002
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:20,400
Let's actually do that. Hold on. Number sign. Not in Ontario anymore.

1003
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:24,080
If it's a new construction, they can up their own. I don't think that's true, but let's look.

1004
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:29,600
Let's look. Okay. Let's look. Hold on. In Ontario, can new constructions

1005
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:37,120
have rent increases. Let's see.

1006
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:51,120
Hold on. Let me look into it.

1007
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:04,960
I'm quickly skimming this. I don't want to have another fucking

1008
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:07,120
random ass arc. I'm going to be skimming it.

1009
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:24,320
I think what this is talking about is initial rent.

1010
02:02:29,600 --> 02:02:34,160
I don't want to get sidetracked to fucking again, though.

1011
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:39,760
I don't want to get sidetracked anymore. No more articles. Stop sending me one. Stop.

1012
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:45,840
Terrorist $5 in the U.S. Rent controls instituted. More apartments get converted into condos and sold.

1013
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:51,920
Do you see something similar happen in Canada? No, actually, no. Funnily enough,

1014
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:53,440
that's not happening here. As far as I can tell.

1015
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:58,000
I read this file $5. My second article shows that the claim of the economy returning to normal is

1016
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:02,640
wrong at the CPI is a lie on top of this article. I don't want to keep getting fucking sidetracked.

1017
02:03:05,120 --> 02:03:09,200
Alexander Bryant, $5. I'm behind the stream, but what I think is going on is not economically,

1018
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:11,440
but social. Things are really icing right now. You're going to make pretty good money.

1019
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:18,480
Thank you for the $10, Alexander Bryant. Appreciated.

1020
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:24,640
But what are you... Hold on. No, you're right. Sorry. My brain's all over the place right now.

1021
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:28,800
You're right. I think a lot of what's going on isn't economic. It's social.

1022
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:32,720
People feel like things are actually bad when they're not. That's what I think is going on.

1023
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:38,080
Okay. Hold on. I'm looking up.

1024
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:47,760
Give me a moment.

1025
02:03:54,640 --> 02:04:00,320
Give me a moment.

1026
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:08,240
Listen, you guys in the fucking chat talking about research streams, this is what they are.

1027
02:04:08,240 --> 02:04:11,760
We're researching. Buckle in.

1028
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:48,960
Hold on.

1029
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:53,440
Because of some shortcomings of the consumer price index,

1030
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:59,600
notably that it uses static expenditure weighting and it does not account for substitutions,

1031
02:05:01,360 --> 02:05:08,560
the personal consumption expenditures price index, PCEPI, is an alternative price index

1032
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:15,200
used by the Federal Reserve, among others, to measure inflation. From January 1959

1033
02:05:15,520 --> 02:05:23,120
through July 2018, inflation measured by the PCEPI has averaged at 3.3%

1034
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:29,200
while using the CPI is averaged at 3.8%. That's still pretty close.

1035
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:34,000
Okay. Hold on. Let's see these two different things here.

1036
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:40,960
Okay. Let's pull the data up.

1037
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:45,440
Okay. So.

1038
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:50,800
The consumer price index.

1039
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:58,560
Blue and red lines are the consumer price index measuring inflation.

1040
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:07,680
Green and purple lines are the personal consumption expenditures measuring inflation.

1041
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,880
And it seems like when you actually take in those other things into account that they do,

1042
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:14,320
inflation is actually lower.

1043
02:06:18,640 --> 02:06:26,000
Hold on. So the PCEPI takes into account the substitution effect,

1044
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:35,280
which is your criticism of the CPI, Artemis. But it seems like the PCEPI has less

1045
02:06:35,600 --> 02:06:39,840
the PCEPI has less highs and lows and measured inflation.

1046
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:46,160
Like. Huh. Okay.

1047
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:52,160
What is this data for ants?

1048
02:06:55,360 --> 02:07:01,600
Ballcrafted your board, then get the fuck out. Goddamn it. Let's see here.

1049
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:09,200
Oh, God. Artemis, what's wrong with it then? Tell me what's wrong with it this time. You fuck.

1050
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:16,640
Yet comparison to CPI. Here we go.

1051
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:20,960
The formula effect accounts for different formulas used to calculate indexes.

1052
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:26,000
Okay. Different formula. Weight account. Okay. The weight effect accounts for

1053
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:30,480
importance. Okay. Out of pocket spending. Okay. Okay.

1054
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:35,280
Let me put it this way. Let me put it this way. Artemis.

1055
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:37,200
Artemis.

1056
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:40,960
Artemis, do you have any actual data?

1057
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:46,320
Since the this other index doesn't show what you're saying,

1058
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:54,080
Artemis, do you have any actual data that shows that things are just getting wildly worse and

1059
02:07:54,080 --> 02:08:05,440
out of control? Like, you know what I mean? Is there any actual data that things are getting

1060
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:08,720
like incredibly really fucking bad here? You know what I mean?

1061
02:08:13,120 --> 02:08:13,920
Okay. Hold on.

1062
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:19,840
I heard of Mrs. Other article.

1063
02:08:25,200 --> 02:08:32,320
Okay. This one? No, we just read this one. What's the other one? This one.

1064
02:08:39,120 --> 02:08:40,160
This one. Okay.

1065
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:47,360
Okay. Second article.

1066
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:57,760
Credit card balances spike in the third quarter to a 1.08 trillion record.

1067
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:01,520
Damn. What are you all using your credit cards on?

1068
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:09,760
Collectively, Americans now owe 1.08 trillion on their credit cards.

1069
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:16,320
Persistently higher prices have caused consumers to spend down their savings and increasingly turn

1070
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:21,120
to credit cards to make ends meet. At the same time, credit cards are one of the most expensive

1071
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:27,360
ways to borrow money. What are you guys buying? Like, if you're buying food is one thing. If

1072
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:29,840
you're just buying big TVs, I don't give a shit. Like, you're retarded.

1073
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:37,600
Okay. Credit card balances have spiked by 1.54 billion year over year.

1074
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:42,480
Credit card balances experience a large jump in the third quarter consistent with

1075
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:47,840
strong consumer spending and real GDP growth. Okay. What are they spending it on?

1076
02:09:50,560 --> 02:09:54,720
Credit card delinquency also rose a boss across the board, especially among millennials

1077
02:09:55,680 --> 02:10:00,720
or borrowers between the ages of 30 and 39 who are burdened by high levels of student loan debt.

1078
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:05,680
Oh, is this a student loan debt thing? Maybe. Okay. With most people feeling

1079
02:10:05,680 --> 02:10:10,160
strained by higher prices for food, gas, and housing, most cardholders are carrying

1080
02:10:10,160 --> 02:10:12,400
debt from month to month or falling behind on their payments.

1081
02:10:13,360 --> 02:10:17,280
And a greater percentage of balances are going more than 180 days delinquent.

1082
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:22,960
Nearly one-tenth of credit card users find themselves in persistent debt

1083
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:27,680
when they are charged more in interest fees each year than they pay towards the principal,

1084
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:33,840
a pattern that is increasingly difficult to break. The issue really is what are they buying

1085
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:39,360
with this stuff? Because if it's literally like Netflix and Starbucks, I don't care.

1086
02:10:40,080 --> 02:10:41,600
They can simply fucking burn.

1087
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:52,880
$2 from lives and does walls are buying super chats. Thanks, buddy. Thanks.

1088
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,200
Love the last video dev from Donald Donovan. Thank you, dude.

1089
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:02,400
Okay. $5 almost filed. Let me clear this article is directly addressing your claim that it's

1090
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:07,280
social because you are incapable of understanding the graphs you were throwing. That is not true,

1091
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:09,760
Artemis. That is not true, but thank you for the money.

1092
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:19,040
And yes, the video was great. Another classic. Thank you very much, Mr. Bra. Thank you.

1093
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:28,320
Okay. Let's see. Let's see here. Okay. Why credit cards keep debt keeps rising.

1094
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:32,320
Despite the steep cost, consumers often turn to credit cards in part because they're more

1095
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:36,400
accessible than other types of loans that comes at the expense of other financial goals.

1096
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:40,400
That's money that doesn't go to a college fund or down payment on a home purchase.

1097
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:48,240
Okay. Until recently, most Americans benefited from a few government supplied safety nets,

1098
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:54,400
most notably at the large injection of stimulus money, which left many households sitting on a

1099
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:59,760
stockpile of cash that enabled some card holders to keep their credit card balances in check.

1100
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:04,640
But that cash reserve is largely gone after consumers gradually spent

1101
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:08,320
down their excess savings from the COVID-19 pandemic years. Okay. So

1102
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:16,720
could it be that these people lost their job during the pandemic,

1103
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:21,200
got a bunch of money from the government that tied them over, never found a new job,

1104
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:26,800
and now they're just broke and poor and spending money they don't have? That's possible.

1105
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:33,280
Could it be that some of these people are retards, got a giant fucking inflow of cash,

1106
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:39,680
thought, Oh my God, dude, this is, Oh, this is amazing. Spent all of it. But because they're

1107
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:45,040
dumb animals, they didn't actually get their habits under control. And so after the cash

1108
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:50,080
flow stopped coming in, they kept spending like they still had that flow. And now they find

1109
02:12:50,080 --> 02:12:56,640
themselves in debt. It's also probably possible. People are retards like that for sure.

1110
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:04,960
Phil Swift, $10. It feels like culture war is more one-sided than ever. Right wing presence

1111
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:08,720
online isn't as strong as it was during Trump's term. From my experience, it's super noticeable

1112
02:13:08,720 --> 02:13:12,000
as a passive observer. I don't agree at all. It's bill Swift. Thank you for the $10. I don't agree

1113
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:18,560
with you. I think the right wing is currently ascended. Um, ball craft $2. I've heard articles

1114
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:23,520
are coming eventually. Um, can we get the dev debt as a tool thing again? I think people need

1115
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:29,840
it. Yeah, exactly. Right. Like victim blaming. What are they victims of their own fucking

1116
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:35,600
spending? What are you talking about? Number sign. Okay. I swear to God. All right. There's,

1117
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:40,080
there's more right-wingers in my chat. Like people in my chat who are more right-wing than me,

1118
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:45,200
but also the right wingers in my chat. They're more communist than me.

1119
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:50,640
It's like, Oh my God, dude. Oh, the bourgeois, the, the bankers, the international capital is

1120
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:58,080
fucking the working class, dude. It's like Jesus fucking Christ. No dev being like, I need evidence

1121
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:02,400
and also dev makes loads of assumptions. Did you not just hear what I said? I just said,

1122
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:08,560
it's possible. This is th this is one of the reasons it's possible. This is a different

1123
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:12,560
reason. I'm not saying I'm not making assumptions. I'm saying this is possible.

1124
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:15,920
Possible. All right.

1125
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:26,880
It's possible that these are the cases. Okay. Here, here, chat. Actually I want to hear,

1126
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:29,760
I want to hear why do you think this is happening? Chat. Go ahead.

1127
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:32,800
What are the various possibilities? Go.

1128
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:43,760
I almost found $20 dev. You hack. You immediately paint the people having to incur more credit card

1129
02:14:43,760 --> 02:14:48,160
debt specifically to pay rent or food, but claim they're buying Netflix. You're blaming people

1130
02:14:48,160 --> 02:14:52,240
instinctually and covering for the government. No artists. I just said it's possible. What do

1131
02:14:52,240 --> 02:15:01,600
you think possible means? You fuck. Okay. It's possible that these are people who lost their

1132
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:05,520
jobs during the pandemic. And now they have to, they had to use all the government stimulus to

1133
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:10,080
pay for rent or food, but after the pandemic, they never got their jobs back. So now they're

1134
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:15,120
fucked. And they're, and they're spending with credit. That's possible. It's also possible that

1135
02:15:15,120 --> 02:15:20,880
these are people who got used to living high off the hog with the government cheese coming in.

1136
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:25,040
And now that that's run out, they're not, they're not tampering down on their spending again.

1137
02:15:25,040 --> 02:15:28,240
And now they're, they're still spending more because they like that, that new lifestyle.

1138
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:32,400
And now they're in debt. That's also possible. What are the possibilities going to be?

1139
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,640
There's probably more. There's probably more that I haven't thought of.

1140
02:15:44,880 --> 02:15:48,080
Teres Shvinko, $5. People can sidetrack you with super chats. Can I purchase the first article?

1141
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:50,880
We'll get to articles right after this. Okay.

1142
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:59,040
Yeah. Great. Clay or not says I maxed out my credit card game

1143
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:02,160
on waifu games in 2020. I was retarded. Yeah. Well, there you go. Yeah.

1144
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:20,240
$5 Phil Swift ascending on God. Just like that. That just isn't the general question I get.

1145
02:16:20,240 --> 02:16:23,840
I'll be at looking at places like Twitter aren't good indicators. It does feel like culturally the

1146
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:29,920
right wings on the upstream right now. It does feel like a, a lot of the ESG DEI stuff is being

1147
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:33,920
rolled back. A lot of the cancel culture stuff has gone. Like the right is ascending right now.

1148
02:16:38,320 --> 02:16:44,640
Okay. $5 on Devin. Your stream should be called E Falk. Every frame and argument with Chad

1149
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:49,280
are most follow $5. You have no evidence for your assertions. You are theory crafting.

1150
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:57,760
Yes. I'm looking at this and I'm saying, what are the possible reasons? Because that is what

1151
02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:02,880
you do when you're trying to figure things out. What are the possible reasons? Do you

1152
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:09,200
have any possible reasons? I know the gold standard is fucking retarded.

1153
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:14,480
Okay. Let's see.

1154
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:23,200
Consumers are maintaining and supporting their lifestyles using credit card debt.

1155
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:28,960
That could be the lifestyle of just barely getting by after losing a job or the lifestyle

1156
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:33,200
of spending way too much fucking money during the pandemic either, or I don't know.

1157
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:39,920
It's been a struggle, said Adriana Cubillo, 25, 25 years old of Modesto, California.

1158
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:43,920
My rent is going up. So even though all my bills are paid, I'm sometimes living paycheck to paycheck.

1159
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:51,520
Okay. I mean, you got to move out of California obviously, but still doesn't, there's no like no

1160
02:17:51,520 --> 02:18:05,120
reasons given here. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. Well, you know what? We can look it up. Hold on.

1161
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:15,040
Is there any reason for this? Let's see. Hold on.

1162
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:24,000
Yeah. Credit card delinquencies are arising fastest among lower income borrowers,

1163
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,280
millennials, people who hold other kinds of debt like auto or student loans,

1164
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:29,200
according to the federal reserve bank of New York,

1165
02:18:30,880 --> 02:18:36,880
rising inflation is one factor behind the problem. Okay. Let's see.

1166
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:44,880
Okay. Let's take a look. Let's take a look.

1167
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:58,320
During the pandemic, many Americans use stimulus payments from the government to help pay off their

1168
02:18:58,320 --> 02:19:02,480
credit card debt, but things drastically change once. So they already had the debt

1169
02:19:03,360 --> 02:19:04,960
before the pandemic.

1170
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:12,480
There's Shevanko $10. I don't think ESG is declining for cultural reasons like tech

1171
02:19:12,480 --> 02:19:16,000
firing is expensive. Any product that ESG can't be sustained with more expensive borrowing.

1172
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:18,000
I got to think about it for a bit more.

1173
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:24,800
Prices are going up. Wages are decreasing. Communist. Communist.

1174
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:31,200
The free market means that the seller of goods can sell them at whatever price they like.

1175
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:35,840
You fucking commies. All you right wing commies in the chat.

1176
02:19:46,640 --> 02:19:53,760
Yep. Low income borrowers are bad with credit. This has always been the case. Millennials. Okay.

1177
02:19:53,760 --> 02:20:04,480
Raising interest rates to combat inflation. Even credit card users with higher payments.

1178
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:10,560
They don't pay off their monthly balance in full. Okay.

1179
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:16,320
It doesn't have the answer I'm looking for though.

1180
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:22,880
It's not a free market. Oh my God.

1181
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:28,960
What I mean to say is, it is not the government raising prices,

1182
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:37,040
it's the companies raising prices, which is completely fine within a capitalist system.

1183
02:20:46,320 --> 02:21:00,080
The real free market has never been tried. Communist. All of you.

1184
02:21:05,440 --> 02:21:11,840
Okay. I'm done with this, with this rabbit hole. We're done with it.

1185
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:15,840
Yeah. Donovan Gill for $10. Thank you.

1186
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:22,000
If we are talking about the economy, the stock market is being carried by seven companies,

1187
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:23,840
the inflation is being brought under control,

1188
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:28,400
interest rates are insane, we will all be fine. Yep. I think things will actually be okay.

1189
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:40,960
Okay. Given enough time, things will be fine.

1190
02:21:46,640 --> 02:21:51,120
When money printer go brr, those who get it first benefit and the rest of us pay for it.

1191
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:54,960
That's not capitalism. Sounds like you should be buying some bonds, buddy.

1192
02:21:58,400 --> 02:22:09,600
All right. It's interesting to listen to Dev because everything is framed as if the people

1193
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:13,920
screwing up and the government is not to blame for this. Each solution he provided says it's

1194
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:24,080
the people's fault. Listen, even if the government is to blame, and they might be like, who the fuck

1195
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:32,080
knows, right? You are also partially to blame for your circumstance. Simple as that, especially

1196
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:37,280
now that you've, that you've now seen what's going on, right? Like, Oh shit, dude, my credit card has

1197
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:41,920
a 20% interest rate on it. Should I go buy that completely unnecessary bullshit and put on my

1198
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:46,960
credit card? No, you shouldn't. And if you do, it is your fault. Even if the interest rate is,

1199
02:22:46,960 --> 02:22:50,560
is completely the fault of the government, the fact that you're out there swiping your card.

1200
02:22:50,560 --> 02:23:00,400
Yeah, that is you. $5 from a Ory. Thank you. Luxury. Good sales are increasing and it's

1201
02:23:00,400 --> 02:23:04,640
overwhelmingly low income households that spend money. They don't have to show off that they're

1202
02:23:04,640 --> 02:23:10,640
not poor. Exactly. Exactly. You got people who have no fucking money buying cars, way out of

1203
02:23:10,640 --> 02:23:16,000
their league, buying like giant fucking TVs, buying tons of shit. They don't need buy nice

1204
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,720
clothes, trying to look good. And it's like, shut the fuck up. Like, what are you doing? You,

1205
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:27,680
you retard. You deserve your fucking poverty. Yeah, they're, they're, they're debt maxing,

1206
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:44,080
baby. They're debt maxing. I was super busy during the pandemic in a computer RMA department.

1207
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:47,440
Lots of people were buying computers and now that the stimulus money dried up and the pandemic is

1208
02:23:47,440 --> 02:23:57,120
over. Business is slow. Yep. That's about right. I could buy buns bonds or the government could

1209
02:23:57,120 --> 02:24:08,320
leave me alone. God. Oh fuck. Libertarianism is not a serious philosophy guys. It's just not.

1210
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:14,160
You want all the benefits of society, but you don't want to pay a government for them.

1211
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:17,040
It's dumb. That's stupid.

1212
02:24:24,240 --> 02:24:26,960
I mean, if you want to, like, if you want to implement like a,

1213
02:24:28,240 --> 02:24:34,240
an IQ limit for loans, you can do that. Sure. Sure. Loans only for smart people because they

1214
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:38,160
want to destroy themselves with them. I mean, think about it here. How about this? Just take

1215
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:48,160
away, take away everybody's poor credit card. Why not take them away? If you're all poor,

1216
02:24:48,160 --> 02:24:51,840
you don't get a credit card anymore because you always can't be trusted with it. That sounds

1217
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:56,240
pretty good. Right? It's like, Oh shit. I'm so poor and stupid. I spent all my money. I just

1218
02:24:56,240 --> 02:25:00,720
kept swiping the card. Now I owe so much on it. Oh, my life's fucked. Okay. No more credit card

1219
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:01,120
for you.

1220
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:12,000
The South Korea don't have the same issue. What are you talking about? I don't know what you're

1221
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:26,160
referring to. Sorry, but thank you for the $2. Every millennial and Zoomer crying about working

1222
02:25:26,160 --> 02:25:31,920
40 hours a week and barely making rent is at fault. They buy premium shit. They buy expensive

1223
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:36,880
shit they don't need. They buy every subscription service. Yes. This is all fucking true.

1224
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:43,120
You deserve their fucking poverty. Yep.

1225
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:56,480
Okay. My God, it's been two and a half hours. You haven't talked about any articles yet.

1226
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:03,040
Maybe I should just cut down to only like the fun articles because I have way too many articles

1227
02:26:03,040 --> 02:26:12,800
here as well. We already have that. It's called the credit score. Now, you know what? No, you

1228
02:26:12,800 --> 02:26:16,000
guys, you guys deserve the articles. We'll go through them. We'll go through them all.

1229
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Let's go article time. You guys ready?

1230
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:32,560
So you guys complained about me reading old articles.

1231
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:37,360
Here's an old article for you from 1797. We're going to read it.

1232
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:46,160
The Hatters Gazette reprints from an old journal dated January 16th, 1797.

1233
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:52,960
The following amusing account of the wearing of the first silk hat in London. John Hetherington,

1234
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:59,280
haberdasher of the Strand, was arraigned before the Lord Mayor yesterday on a charge of the breach

1235
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:06,800
of the peace and inciting to riot and was required to give bonds in the sum of 500 pounds. It was in

1236
02:27:06,800 --> 02:27:12,320
evidence that Mr. Hetherington, who is well connected, appeared on the public highway wearing

1237
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:19,360
upon his head what he called a silk hat, which was offered in evidence, a tall structure having

1238
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:26,400
a shiny luster and calculated to frighten timid people. As a matter of fact, the officers of the

1239
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:33,200
crown stated several women fainted at the unusual sight while children screamed, dogs yelped, and a

1240
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:38,960
younger son of Cordwainer Thomas, who was returning from a chandler's shop, was thrown down by the

1241
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:46,400
crowd which had collected and had his right arm broken. For these reasons, the defendant was seized

1242
02:27:46,400 --> 02:27:51,360
by the guards and taken before the Lord Mayor. An extenuation of his crime, the defendant claimed

1243
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:57,200
that he had not violated any law of the kingdom but was merely exercising a right to appear in

1244
02:27:57,200 --> 02:28:06,160
a headdress of his own design, a right not denied to any Englishman. Here he was, wearing the first

1245
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:20,720
ever top hat. The average TF2 hater. Two dollars from Dr. Nutter is now a weekly slur.

1246
02:28:21,520 --> 02:28:25,760
So there you go guys. There's the there's an old article for you. How do you like it?

1247
02:28:25,760 --> 02:28:38,720
Two teens were busted in the subway stabbing of a man who wished them a happy new year. Jesus fuck.

1248
02:28:40,960 --> 02:28:47,280
Here's the teens. Two teens have been arrested and charged with attempted murder in connection

1249
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:50,640
to the brutal stabbing of a man who wished him a happy new year in a Bronx subway platform.

1250
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:59,360
Emanuel Awa and Elias Aflada, both 19, were cuffed and they faced robbery and assault charges linked

1251
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:06,800
to the January 1st stabbing that left Carlos Peliza, 29, with serious injuries. Peliza was

1252
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:11,760
standing on the southbound D train platform at the 182nd street, 103rd street station in Fordham

1253
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:17,680
Heights around 8 45 p.m. when four strangers walked up to him. He greeted the crew with happy

1254
02:29:17,680 --> 02:29:25,280
new year before they suddenly began pummeling him. Then one of the attackers whipped out an

1255
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:29,360
unknown sharp object and stabbed the victim multiple times all over his body.

1256
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:37,680
Jesus fucking degenerates dude. There they are in New York.

1257
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:48,160
So there is something I've noticed, right? When it's black people attacking white people,

1258
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:55,840
the media does not put race in the headline. They might put race in the article and the pictures

1259
02:29:55,840 --> 02:30:03,920
certainly show race, but in the headline, no race. But when it's a white person attacking a black

1260
02:30:03,920 --> 02:30:08,880
person, nobody has any, yeah, they say youths, they say whatever, but like when it's a white

1261
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:14,800
person attacking a black person, they have no problem putting race in the headline. And honestly

1262
02:30:14,800 --> 02:30:24,000
that double standard is fucking disgusting. Okay. What's next? Oh yeah. This is from info wars,

1263
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:30,720
dude. Info wars back in August 18th, Biden administration preparing to bring back full

1264
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:34,400
COVID restrictions. The rollout is going to begin in mid September.

1265
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:47,840
This rollout didn't happen, did it? This rollout seems to have not taken place.

1266
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:55,360
Let's see whistleblowers from the TSA and border patrol have raised the alarm to info wars that

1267
02:30:55,360 --> 02:30:58,480
the Biden administration is setting the stage for a full COVID lockdown,

1268
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:05,680
masking TSA employees in mid September. Let's see. Let's see. They're going to be,

1269
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:09,600
they're re-implementing masking starting with airports as early as mid September.

1270
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:17,120
Then the policy will escalate and by mid October mask will be required by all pilots, flight staff,

1271
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:24,880
passengers, and airport patrons. Where's the rollout guys? It's not a matter of if,

1272
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:29,600
but when the official numbers of COVID will go up and they will return to forced masking.

1273
02:31:34,160 --> 02:31:38,000
Hold on. The big AC. We knew about headline racism years ago. You didn't know. I've been here too,

1274
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:43,840
you fucking moron. I'm just not blaming like all blacks or all whites or whatever the fuck

1275
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:49,680
for any of this nonsense. See, your answer guys. Good news. I was about to get into a car crash,

1276
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:52,560
but I steered out of the way. Clearly there was never a threat of a crash.

1277
02:31:52,560 --> 02:32:00,160
I never said that seed brands are what I said is that like this isn't threat of a car crash.

1278
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:06,240
This is not the same situation. This is it's happening and it didn't happen. That's the point.

1279
02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:10,800
I'm kind of curious. Does this article?

1280
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:18,240
Oh no, it's still here. Okay. Yeah. All right. Maybe you would have deleted it. Okay.

1281
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:25,840
Yeah, dude. Alex Jones has warned that this system will bring back biomedical tyranny

1282
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:31,280
and the launch of this new crisis in September will allow a buildup of control

1283
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:34,000
that would allow the use of mail-in ballots for the next presidential,

1284
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:40,000
mail-in ballots are already common. You don't need, you know, if you don't like mail-in ballots,

1285
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,920
that's fine. That's one thing, but they don't need another excuse. They're already here. All right.

1286
02:32:43,920 --> 02:32:55,200
So anyway, yeah, listen, regardless of what else happened, this did not seem to happen.

1287
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:58,960
This seems to be fucking fear-mongering on the part of Infowars.

1288
02:33:01,360 --> 02:33:06,320
Five dollars from lives and does walls. I've seen unalived rather than killed in a headline

1289
02:33:06,320 --> 02:33:09,520
regarding a murder involving the new asylum seekers. Fucking ridiculous, dude. Yeah.

1290
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:19,200
Yeah. Yes. The Infowars headline is clickbait, but I'm calling out clickbait as bullshit.

1291
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:29,680
Zam, as he says, Deb has a parasocial relationship. I've actually been thinking about this.

1292
02:33:30,480 --> 02:33:38,880
I think on some level, parasociality goes both ways, right? Because I know people who are here a

1293
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:45,200
lot. I know. I know when I recognize the name, I see him every single stream. I'm like, yeah,

1294
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:48,480
it's that guy. Yeah, it's that guy. Then when he goes away and comes back six months later,

1295
02:33:48,480 --> 02:33:53,200
I'm like, oh, where did you go, dude? Like, it kind of feels bad when someone leaves,

1296
02:33:53,200 --> 02:34:00,000
right? On my end, like me looking at the chat and noticing someone disappears and it's like,

1297
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:04,640
oh, where did that guy go? Like, I do miss him. And like, I think the parasocial relationship

1298
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:09,440
goes both ways. You know what I mean? Because, and then like, he comes back in six months and

1299
02:34:09,440 --> 02:34:14,160
he says, I was gone doing this. And I was like, oh, dude, like, like, we can't, we catch up. And

1300
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:20,320
it's, it's, there's like a feeling of like, oh, you left, you know, you don't know me. Hey,

1301
02:34:20,320 --> 02:34:29,440
real STS. How's it going, buddy? Also like the people who now hate watch, or the people who

1302
02:34:29,440 --> 02:34:33,680
used to like you, and now they hate you, and they're on other channels, like shitting on you,

1303
02:34:34,240 --> 02:34:38,080
like that feels pretty bad sometimes. You know what I mean? It's like, five years ago,

1304
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:42,240
you were in my comments, posting and having fun, and everyone's having a good time. And now you're

1305
02:34:42,240 --> 02:34:46,960
in someone else's chat. Like, you know, a lot of these audience are like former dev viewers who

1306
02:34:46,960 --> 02:34:52,080
now hate me, right? And I go in there. And like, anytime I come up, they're like frothing in the

1307
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:56,000
mouth to say negative things about me. And it's because they feel like I've backstabbed them

1308
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:02,080
because I'm not a right winger. And they are, you know what I mean? So it does kind of feel bad.

1309
02:35:02,080 --> 02:35:06,480
When I'm just like, oh, yeah, you're kind of cool. Five years ago, but you've lost your

1310
02:35:06,480 --> 02:35:12,160
fucking mind. And now you're over here, like hating on me. So I think there's definitely

1311
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:18,720
a parasocial aspect from, like streamer to chat, not just from chat to streamer, definitely.

1312
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:25,120
Now, the real Joe Biden $20 Thank you, isn't the argument that see you right? Oh,

1313
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:27,920
it's stinky dumb dumbs. They didn't lock you down forever. So you were wrong.

1314
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:31,360
The same as the left saying someone didn't get truly canceled because they didn't commit the

1315
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:39,360
sewer slide. No, no, because the right always specifically said this was going to be eternal

1316
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:44,080
COVID fascism, you're going to be living in a social credit score for the rest of your life.

1317
02:35:44,080 --> 02:35:47,920
This was going to they were going to be marching the jackboots up and down the street,

1318
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:52,000
you were going to lose all of your rights, nothing was ever coming back. The right was

1319
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:55,840
very specific about this being permanent, and they were wrong about that permanence.

1320
02:35:55,840 --> 02:36:04,240
So that is a difference. But thank you for the $20 I do appreciate it. $10 from art of us. Thank

1321
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:08,000
you again, dude. Regardless of the fact that people have fought back against the mask mandates

1322
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:12,080
that were reapplied, because they aren't here now. They were never tried. I never said that

1323
02:36:12,080 --> 02:36:17,200
Artemis. What I'm saying is like, I don't think that there was actually ever going to be a rollout.

1324
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:23,360
And I think this is just a lie. There probably are times in which they try to roll something out.

1325
02:36:23,360 --> 02:36:26,320
And then people say, fuck you, and then it doesn't happen. And that's what should happen,

1326
02:36:26,320 --> 02:36:30,640
by the way, like, that's how it should be. Governments should, in fact, respond to the

1327
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:36,480
popular will of the citizens. Because democracy as actually isn't a sham, guys. But I think this

1328
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:47,280
was just cope on the fact of employers this time. Start again, $2 hard to have relationships with

1329
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:56,480
the swarm of bees. Yeah, I know what you mean, dude. $2 from ball craft, do more 1860s articles.

1330
02:37:04,960 --> 02:37:13,040
Okay, let's keep on let's keep on going. Harada denies the role in Tekken eight jiggle physics

1331
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:21,120
blames programmers and modelers based jiggle physics aren't a new phenomenon. They've been

1332
02:37:21,120 --> 02:37:25,280
around just as long as modern entertainment has been if not longer. But jiggle physics are

1333
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:31,040
arguably more prevalent in video games with the like of streets fighters, sixes Chun Li,

1334
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:37,520
and the entire femme fatale cast of Dead or Alive roster almost all cited examples. Tekken has its

1335
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:42,320
fair share of female fighters, whose breasts are for a lack of better phrasing out of control.

1336
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:50,320
While it's easy to blame the issue on Katsuhiro Harada, the longtime producer of the Tekken

1337
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:56,880
franchise, it appears the ever vocal developer specifically asked not to incorporate jiggle

1338
02:37:56,880 --> 02:38:03,680
physics into Tekken but to no avail. He wanted Tekken's character movements to be more serious

1339
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:09,520
and stiff and to stand out from their fighting games. However, much to his surprise, character

1340
02:38:09,600 --> 02:38:12,400
chess started bouncing once the game was close to being finished.

1341
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:17,520
He added that programmers and modelers were secretly working on it together.

1342
02:38:19,200 --> 02:38:23,360
He eventually relented after seeing that each title improved on the physics of the previous

1343
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:27,840
entry, explaining that the muscles and fat started to sway more naturally with each work.

1344
02:38:28,720 --> 02:38:36,160
Hey, dude. More jiggle physics. Holtsnader for $5 Thank you. I never thought that I thought that

1345
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:40,560
this would be something that the government could use to coerce the population when needed.

1346
02:38:40,560 --> 02:38:44,400
I don't think it's happening, man. I don't think it's happening. I don't think any of

1347
02:38:44,400 --> 02:38:50,160
this shit's coming back, to be honest. And also, there's definitely like the argument of

1348
02:38:50,800 --> 02:38:54,320
if there's actually a super serious pandemic, should they lock down? The answer is probably

1349
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:58,960
yes. But like, how do you trust them when they say it's super serious? Probably not.

1350
02:38:58,960 --> 02:39:00,800
So like, there's a balance here, for sure.

1351
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:06,000
Because if it actually was a super serious pandemic,

1352
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:12,640
and the government said, listen, guys, like, we don't have to do this. Disregarding the

1353
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:18,720
trust issue you should in the super serious pandemic, right? Okay.

1354
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:28,960
Damn. Anyway, he gave a statement in his episode of Harada's Bar.

1355
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:35,120
Oh, my God, breast physics and video games have become a controversial subject in recent years.

1356
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:38,560
The issue is often grouped together with the industry's still unrealistic body standards,

1357
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:41,120
the improving but still lacking representation diversity in games,

1358
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:45,120
as well as a sometimes purposely stunted character development obvious civilization of virtual

1359
02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:54,720
women. No, sexualize them all. Sexualize all the women's. And frankly, most of the men do.

1360
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:58,560
Anyway, Tekken's coming out. It's probably gonna be okay.

1361
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:09,840
Oh, yeah. Ex porn star Mia Khalifa uses face mask to pick up dog poo, then puts it back on.

1362
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:15,680
What the fuck? $2 a whole scenario. I'm happy to be wrong. I agreed in the serious.

1363
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:19,280
Yeah. Thanks, man. Thank you for the donations, dude.

1364
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:29,360
Okay. The Lebanese American took her pup out for a stroll when it decided it couldn't hold it in

1365
02:40:29,360 --> 02:40:36,400
any longer. So she picks it up. Someone was recording. This is gross. She picked up the

1366
02:40:36,400 --> 02:40:50,320
dog poo with her mask, threw it away and put the mask back on. God. Mia Khalifa 27 removed her mask

1367
02:40:50,320 --> 02:40:54,960
keeping up the apparent muck before dropping it in a nearby bin. Viewers were then made to skirmish

1368
02:40:54,960 --> 02:41:04,640
you put the covering back on before resuming her walk. Oh, God. I just saw Mia Khalifa put poop on

1369
02:41:04,640 --> 02:41:11,680
her face. And then she replied, at least I'm not an anti-masker. Oh, my God, dude.

1370
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:22,640
I just got back from traveling and I have to walk my dog. So safety first. Everyone has to

1371
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:25,680
wear a mask. Some people believe that the video is a hoax. Both parties are looking for publicity.

1372
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:31,840
She's still cute. It's still worth to go back and watch her porn,

1373
02:41:31,840 --> 02:41:34,320
but I don't think she has much value otherwise.

1374
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:43,440
Yep. That's kind of gross, isn't it? Okay.

1375
02:41:47,040 --> 02:41:54,640
Oklahoma lawmaker. This is the thumbnail. Oklahoma lawmaker wants animal control to

1376
02:41:54,640 --> 02:41:59,680
take furries from public schools. Send her to the pound, boys. Send them to the pound.

1377
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:08,720
A student behaving like a silly goose in Oklahoma could soon be hauled out of class by animal

1378
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:19,280
control. State Rep Justin Humphrey introduced a bill on Tuesday that would ban furries from

1379
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:24,400
public schools across the state and allow animal control to come round them up.

1380
02:42:24,400 --> 02:42:31,040
Students who purport to be an imaginary animal or animal species, or who engage in anthropomorphic

1381
02:42:31,040 --> 02:42:37,360
behavior commonly referred to as furries at the school, shall not be allowed to participate in

1382
02:42:37,360 --> 02:42:45,760
school curriculum or activities. The legislation would require parents or guardians to pick up the

1383
02:42:45,760 --> 02:42:51,200
child from school. Otherwise, animal control services shall be contacted to remove the

1384
02:42:51,840 --> 02:42:53,920
student.

1385
02:42:58,640 --> 02:43:01,600
There's no way it's going to pass, right? But it's fucking hilarious.

1386
02:43:03,520 --> 02:43:06,640
GigaChad. Everyone post those GigaChads, dude.

1387
02:43:14,800 --> 02:43:19,200
The Republican lawmaker previously proposed creating a Bigfoot hunting season in the state

1388
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:23,360
and did not expand on the definition of furry-esque behaviors or what kind of

1389
02:43:23,360 --> 02:43:26,800
animalistic mannerisms or dress would get a kid kicked out of the classroom.

1390
02:43:26,800 --> 02:43:29,840
Thanks to the two dollars, Bellcraft, that they identified as animals.

1391
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:39,600
Although the bill itself did not include a goal or reasoning for its existence, Humphrey previously

1392
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:44,320
said it was to deter children from identifying as animals. People are going to call me insane for

1393
02:43:44,320 --> 02:43:49,280
running this bill. Hell, I say that they're insane. Women have discovered the final dog

1394
02:43:49,280 --> 02:43:53,120
pill. Unless there's compliance to the bill. Thanks, guys.

1395
02:43:57,600 --> 02:44:00,160
If you got an animal coming to school, how are you going to get them vaccinated? How

1396
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:02,320
about we get them neutered and how about we send them to the pound?

1397
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:07,360
The Republicans seemingly pointed to a bogus rumor that Michigan's school district was providing

1398
02:44:07,360 --> 02:44:12,240
litter box for students identified as furries. Yeah, that was last year's fucking nonsense.

1399
02:44:12,800 --> 02:44:16,080
Imagine trying to legally define furry behavior. Oh my fucking god, dude.

1400
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:22,800
I don't want to see some kid go to the bathroom in a litter box in the kitty litter.

1401
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:31,440
These people, those people up bare have lost their mind letting these people pretend to

1402
02:44:31,440 --> 02:44:34,240
be animals in the classroom. If they're going to be animals,

1403
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:37,120
let's send them to the pound. Let's send them home. How do you teach a cat math?

1404
02:44:37,920 --> 02:44:43,440
There are an estimated 250,000 people in the USA who identify as furries,

1405
02:44:43,440 --> 02:44:47,280
a subculture whose members enjoy dressing up as cartoonish animals,

1406
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:53,600
sometimes as a sexual fetish, but more often as a fun escape. Fucking fur fags, guys.

1407
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:04,480
I accidentally went to a swingers party on a first date, but rather than leave, I slept with 50 men.

1408
02:45:07,520 --> 02:45:08,160
Okay, lady.

1409
02:45:10,560 --> 02:45:15,680
A model who accidentally went to a swingers party on a first date revealed that instead of leaving,

1410
02:45:15,680 --> 02:45:21,760
she ended up having sex with over 50 men and found it empowering. Her name is Kazumi Squirts.

1411
02:45:23,440 --> 02:45:30,560
She's 24. Teddies. Thanks, Benjamin Hardy. Thanks for the $2. Kazumi Squirts,

1412
02:45:30,560 --> 02:45:36,720
who lives in Malibu, California, lifted the lid on her most unconventional first date.

1413
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:40,000
Where she accidentally ended up at a sex party.

1414
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:47,280
Okay, lady. I'm sure you did. Luca the Vile, $2. Thank you.

1415
02:45:47,280 --> 02:45:51,520
Terrific decay is just what we let you know about. Oh my God. Fucking furries.

1416
02:45:54,560 --> 02:45:57,760
Kazumi, who wants to remove the stigma around swingers parties,

1417
02:45:57,760 --> 02:46:01,440
said the whole thing came out when I went on a date with this guy. We were in the car heading

1418
02:46:01,440 --> 02:46:05,440
to a restaurant when he started telling me about a party and his girlmate, who was just as crazy

1419
02:46:05,440 --> 02:46:09,200
as me sexually. It sounded like fun, so I said we should check it out if we're getting food.

1420
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:14,480
When we got there and opened the door, we spotted his friend with loads of guys in various states of

1421
02:46:14,480 --> 02:46:19,680
undress. We had already discussed my interest of swing parties, but I couldn't believe he had

1422
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:24,160
brought me to this party. Me and my date looked at each other. He put my hand on my shoulder and

1423
02:46:24,160 --> 02:46:31,920
said, have fun. So I did. So this wasn't a date. He was basically recruiting you to get fucked by

1424
02:46:31,920 --> 02:46:38,240
his bros. He was going out to hunt down women and bring them into the swinger party. All right.

1425
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:44,400
This wasn't the first time that she had been to a sex party or swap partners. I'm not surprised.

1426
02:46:46,480 --> 02:46:51,200
The open-minded model loves being the center of attention and isn't phased by having sex with

1427
02:46:51,200 --> 02:46:55,920
multiple people on the same night and says that it's empowering to follow your sexual urges.

1428
02:46:55,920 --> 02:47:08,160
I can't wait for her to be like, you know, I've now fucked a thousand guys,

1429
02:47:09,360 --> 02:47:13,840
but I want kids now, so it's time for me to settle down and someone needs to come date me.

1430
02:47:13,840 --> 02:47:21,520
And it's like, nope, nope, fucking nope. Fuck that.

1431
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:30,960
Okay. Vaping does not harm pregnant women or babies. A shocking study claims. Oh,

1432
02:47:30,960 --> 02:47:34,160
I mean, I don't believe it, but maybe it's true. Who knows? Let's take a look.

1433
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:39,200
Smoking cigarettes while pregnant has previously been linked to birth complications and fetal

1434
02:47:39,200 --> 02:47:43,200
damage, but a new study suggests that vaping could be potentially safer option.

1435
02:47:44,320 --> 02:47:48,720
New research from queen Mary university of London found that vaping during pregnancy

1436
02:47:48,720 --> 02:47:53,520
helped expecting mothers quit smoking cigarettes without posing any detectable risks to the

1437
02:47:53,520 --> 02:47:59,120
pregnancy. The team of researchers found that after the first trimester pregnant women who

1438
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:05,440
used a nicotine replacement patches or e-cigarettes gave birth to babies with birth weights,

1439
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:11,280
no different from non-smokers and birth weights significantly higher than those who smoked at all

1440
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:15,440
during their pregnancy. So yeah, I know you swingers. I get it.

1441
02:48:16,240 --> 02:48:18,480
Birth rates is one of those ways you can kind of figure this out,

1442
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:24,880
but it could be something else. Like there's other ways to determine health problems, right?

1443
02:48:27,600 --> 02:48:33,120
There's other ways to determine health problems. I need my child dose math. Yeah.

1444
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:43,840
Yeah. The data says that the data suggests that regular use of nicotine replacement therapy

1445
02:48:43,840 --> 02:48:48,560
don't have any adverse effects on the mother or the baby after the first trimester, nor is

1446
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:54,480
associated with adverse pregnancy events or poor pregnancy outcomes. E-cigarettes help pregnancy

1447
02:48:54,480 --> 02:48:58,400
smokers quit without posing any detectable risk to pregnancy compared with stopping smoking without

1448
02:48:58,400 --> 02:49:06,320
further nicotine use. Hmm. I need to look at it some more, you know.

1449
02:49:18,480 --> 02:49:24,160
Yeah, exactly here. So nicotine can cause permanent damage to the developing fetus's brain

1450
02:49:24,160 --> 02:49:28,000
and other organs. There's not a weight thing. This is an organ damage thing.

1451
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,960
So I don't know about this one, dude.

1452
02:49:36,560 --> 02:49:39,280
No, I gradually was like, are you dead or not like that? No, dude,

1453
02:49:40,400 --> 02:49:46,800
God, I swear to God, you have fucking brain worms. All right. Listen, when someone gives you

1454
02:49:46,800 --> 02:49:53,680
evidence, you don't simply accept it because it jives with what you already know or reject it

1455
02:49:53,680 --> 02:49:57,840
because it doesn't. You have to look at it and examine it and be like, hmm, okay.

1456
02:49:59,360 --> 02:50:04,160
What does the evidence say? What doesn't it say? What is it leaving out? What other possibilities

1457
02:50:04,160 --> 02:50:11,200
are there? All right. Fucking think about it for a bit. Jesus. I fucking hate partisans, dude.

1458
02:50:14,560 --> 02:50:17,200
Like, I hate this too. Jesus.

1459
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:30,000
You still have a severe optimism bias. Yeah, that's because the world's actually mostly good.

1460
02:50:32,480 --> 02:50:35,040
It actually is. If you go outside, you can kind of see that.

1461
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:40,160
Also, you know, just trust the institution to have trust the study.

1462
02:50:40,880 --> 02:50:45,040
Good. God damn it. No, you're being dumb. You're all being stupid.

1463
02:50:45,120 --> 02:50:55,600
It says safer, not safe. Okay, well, it might be safer in the same way that eating cigarette ash

1464
02:50:55,600 --> 02:51:04,720
is safer than eating bleach. Okay, I get it. Let's continue on. Educators are outraged

1465
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:11,520
after attorneys argue that a first grade teacher shot in the school is a workplace injury. What?

1466
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:20,000
The Newport News Education Association president condemned the premise of the school division's

1467
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:27,600
motion to dismiss Abigail Zwirner's pending $40 million lawsuit. The motion was filed last week

1468
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:32,160
by attorneys representing the school board and argues that Zwirner, who was shot in her

1469
02:51:32,160 --> 02:51:39,440
classroom by a six-year-old student, is only entitled to file a worker's compensation claim

1470
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:45,840
because the injury she sustained from the shooting is a workplace injury and the shooting was a

1471
02:51:45,840 --> 02:51:52,400
hazard of the job. What the fuck? No, it's not. It's not a normal part of your job to get shot.

1472
02:51:55,680 --> 02:51:59,760
James Graves, president of the Newport News Teacher's Union, said the argument is

1473
02:51:59,760 --> 02:52:05,120
ridiculous. This is not military. This is not the police department. This is an education system.

1474
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:11,200
These lawyers have started a significant hurricane in our district by saying that being shot is part

1475
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:18,800
of what teachers signed up for. This is a slap in the face. Yes, fucking okay. Let's see if I

1476
02:52:18,800 --> 02:52:25,120
can find an information about the six-year-old. Okay, hold on. Abigail Zwirner, I'm gonna look it

1477
02:52:26,080 --> 02:52:49,120
up. Shooting of Abby Zwirner, a six-year-old male student shot her.

1478
02:52:50,080 --> 02:52:57,920
Oh, my God, dude. Guys, guys, guys. We love you, Dev. I'm just messing with you. Also,

1479
02:52:57,920 --> 02:53:04,560
you're the blinched, reaching expert. Thanks. Thanks. Fucking alternator. Thank you. Okay, listen.

1480
02:53:08,880 --> 02:53:13,120
Okay, hold on.

1481
02:53:13,360 --> 02:53:20,000
The student's conduct included behavioral issues at school, cursing at staff, whipping students

1482
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:27,200
with his belt, and choking a teacher. In 2021, the student came from behind his teacher,

1483
02:53:27,200 --> 02:53:30,880
locked his forearms around her neck, and pulled her backward. He was subsequently moved to a

1484
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:37,840
different school. And the week before the student, and before the shooting, the student was shot.

1485
02:53:37,840 --> 02:53:42,000
Before the shooting, multiple staff members, including Zwirner, told school administrators

1486
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:46,720
about the student's conduct and concerns he might have a weapon. A six-year-old kid brings a fucking

1487
02:53:46,720 --> 02:53:53,280
weapon. Yet, the student threatened to beat up another student, and the student was shot.

1488
02:53:53,280 --> 02:53:57,920
The student was shot, and the student was shot, and the student was shot, and the student was

1489
02:53:57,920 --> 02:54:03,040
shot, and the student was shot, and the student was shot, and the student was shot, and the student

1490
02:54:03,120 --> 02:54:06,960
was shot. The student was shot, and the student was shot, and the student was shot.

1491
02:54:06,960 --> 02:54:09,920
And the student was shot, and the student was shot, and the student was shot.

1492
02:54:13,760 --> 02:54:17,440
Yet, the student threatened to beat up another student. The second teacher went to administrator.

1493
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:20,800
The teacher has taken the bow on herself to search the student's backpack. A third teacher,

1494
02:54:21,360 --> 02:54:23,920
a student has searched another student, and he says he had a gun on the child that he would

1495
02:54:23,920 --> 02:54:29,600
shoot him if they reported it. The teacher was told to wait out the situation as the school day

1496
02:54:29,600 --> 02:54:38,600
She reportedly texted an unidentified individual saying that the student claimed to have a gun and the school administrators weren't helping.

1497
02:54:38,600 --> 02:54:49,600
During a routine lesson at 2pm the student pointed a 9mm Taurus pistol at Zwirner and then shot at her when she tried to reach out for the weapon.

1498
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:53,600
The bullet passed through her hand and then lodged in her chest.

1499
02:54:53,600 --> 02:55:00,600
Police reported that the shooting was intentional and there was no struggle or warning given before the student discharged the gun.

1500
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:08,600
The child's mother, Deja Taylor, owned the gun that the student brought to school in his backpack.

1501
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:18,600
Immediately after being shot, Zwirner escorted all the students out of the classroom and away from the shooter while another staff member restrained the shooter until police took the juvenile detention.

1502
02:55:24,600 --> 02:55:26,600
Oh my god, dude.

1503
02:55:26,600 --> 02:55:28,600
Wild!

1504
02:55:30,600 --> 02:55:35,600
This is fucking... what's the student's race, Dev? Yes, we all know the student's race is black.

1505
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:40,600
We all get it. We get it. This is some inner-city fucking gang-ass bullshit.

1506
02:55:40,600 --> 02:55:56,600
Yeah, this is insane, dude. And the fact that the school administrators didn't do shit.

1507
02:55:56,600 --> 02:55:58,600
Shit.

1508
02:56:08,600 --> 02:56:10,600
My god.

1509
02:56:14,600 --> 02:56:17,600
Oh shit, dude. The kid has ADHD.

1510
02:56:18,600 --> 02:56:20,600
Damn.

1511
02:56:21,600 --> 02:56:27,600
Don't worry, I won't shoot anyone, guys. Don't worry.

1512
02:56:27,600 --> 02:56:30,600
Sean King. 10 Canadian dollars. Thank you.

1513
02:56:30,600 --> 02:56:37,600
I think the reason the guys in here hate it when you tell them that things aren't that bad is because they see it as you are telling them to trust the tribe over the hill.

1514
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:39,600
Oh god, I'm not...

1515
02:56:39,600 --> 02:56:43,600
If that's how they view it, they gotta upgrade their fucking thinking because they're thinking stupidly.

1516
02:56:43,600 --> 02:56:45,600
Stupidly.

1517
02:56:48,600 --> 02:56:52,600
This is victim blaming. The kid's getting justice for his phone, GigaChad.

1518
02:56:58,600 --> 02:57:02,600
Yeah, this is fucking insane, dude. Jesus fucking Christ.

1519
02:57:02,600 --> 02:57:04,600
Okay.

1520
02:57:04,600 --> 02:57:06,600
Let's see.

1521
02:57:06,600 --> 02:57:14,600
Unhinged hospital greeter, 27, has been slapped with several charges, including attempted murder and a Queen stabbing spree.

1522
02:57:14,600 --> 02:57:20,600
Tricky Mario, thanks for the fiver. I bet a lot of Ms. Frizzle's field trips are safe from this student. As I would say, I knew she would stay home today.

1523
02:57:22,600 --> 02:57:27,600
So, this is the unhinged hospital greeter. That's this guy here.

1524
02:57:27,600 --> 02:57:30,600
There he is, our hospital greeter.

1525
02:57:30,600 --> 02:57:36,600
The suspect in the stabbing spree across Queens has been slapped with an attempted murder and assault charge for the five violent attacks.

1526
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:52,600
Jermaine Rigueur, who reportedly laughed in one victim's face after slashing them, was charged late Wednesday with three counts of attempted murder, four counts of assault, one count of attempted assault, and criminal possession of a weapon.

1527
02:57:52,600 --> 02:57:59,600
Wild, dude. Fucking wild.

1528
02:57:59,600 --> 02:58:13,600
Here's the thing. I think even though crime rates are actually going down, what's happening is the few crimes that are left become more sensationalized like these, right?

1529
02:58:13,600 --> 02:58:16,600
This is like, like, this is insane fucking bullshit.

1530
02:58:16,600 --> 02:58:24,600
Listen, you can recognize all the patterns you want. But as I always say, pattern recognition is the beginning of knowledge, not the end.

1531
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:35,600
Like, there's a bunch of idiots on Twitter who are like, I see the pattern. Everyone is black, therefore all the blacks are in fact the criminals and that is just how it is.

1532
02:58:35,600 --> 02:58:49,600
It's like, no, no, no, no, that's just as stupid as not seeing the pattern. That's just as stupid as not seeing the pattern.

1533
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:54,600
It's a string of random attacks. He's been doing random attacks this whole time.

1534
02:58:54,600 --> 02:59:00,600
A 61 year old grandfather was knifed in the back as he walked to the laundromat.

1535
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:06,600
After the alleged perp stabbed him from behind, he turned and smiled at him as he walked away.

1536
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:16,600
Then, a 34 year old Shanika Anderson was stabbed as she walked home just after midnight. Holy shit, dude.

1537
02:59:16,600 --> 02:59:22,600
Look, this guy's like fucked up.

1538
02:59:22,600 --> 02:59:25,600
$10 for Brian Linden.

1539
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:41,600
I'd bet the reason the violent crime graph is off is because it uses UCR rather than NCVS data plus them moving to a new reporting system in 2021, forcing them to rely on estimates for 2021-2022 data.

1540
02:59:41,600 --> 02:59:46,600
Maybe. I don't know. It's possible. I actually do think that things are getting better though.

1541
02:59:46,600 --> 02:59:53,600
There are sensationalist crimes like this guy fucking stabbing randoms, but the crime rates are overall going down.

1542
02:59:53,600 --> 02:59:58,600
Also, hey, Sitch and Adam. Which one of you is it? Is it Adam or is it Sitch?

1543
02:59:58,600 --> 03:00:01,600
Did you watch my new video, by the way?

1544
03:00:01,600 --> 03:00:07,600
I mean, to be honest, it's a video you already know about, to be honest, because you talked about it.

1545
03:00:07,600 --> 03:00:16,600
I heard that you got banned for a week. That sucks.

1546
03:00:16,600 --> 03:00:21,600
Google users can now ask to have their explicit photos removed from search results.

1547
03:00:21,600 --> 03:00:27,600
Oh, dude, if your nudes are out there, you can get them taken down.

1548
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:32,600
S class, baby. Yeah. Well, I like them both, really.

1549
03:00:32,600 --> 03:00:37,600
And also D club. But still. Hey, Sitch.

1550
03:00:37,600 --> 03:00:41,600
Hey, Sitch. I did. It was great. Did you? Because here's the thing.

1551
03:00:42,600 --> 03:00:52,600
Assuming it's such such we've had that conversation on your channel several times about, you know, the whole the the what's the problem with liberalism?

1552
03:00:52,600 --> 03:00:58,600
Oh, yeah. It falls apart into communism sometimes because of these these philosophical reasons.

1553
03:00:58,600 --> 03:01:02,600
Right. That's an argument that you've had with me. You've had it with Sargon.

1554
03:01:02,600 --> 03:01:06,600
And the the video is just outlining how that works.

1555
03:01:06,600 --> 03:01:13,600
And I'm not sure if you if you agree with that logic, but I'm glad you enjoyed the video, though.

1556
03:01:13,600 --> 03:01:25,600
OK, so Google on Thursday rolled out a new policy that allows people to request that their personal sexually explicit photos be removed from search results.

1557
03:01:25,600 --> 03:01:35,600
The new feature is one of three updates that Google says are meant to give users more control over content about themselves that is available through popular search engine.

1558
03:01:35,600 --> 03:01:42,600
Through the popular search engine. It is just one of the many things we're trying to do to help people feel control.

1559
03:01:42,600 --> 03:01:48,600
Of their online experience. Wait, I'm going to be honest, I did watch the video. I was just being played.

1560
03:01:48,600 --> 03:01:53,600
You mean you didn't? You fuck. You can't even lie to me properly, Sitch.

1561
03:01:53,600 --> 03:02:02,600
Well, guess what? Go watch it. Fuck you. Fuck you.

1562
03:02:03,600 --> 03:02:08,600
Sitch, watch more dev videos. You're missing out on all of them.

1563
03:02:08,600 --> 03:02:16,600
Sargon was on Lauren Chen's new show talking about the slide from the rule of the communism. Here's the thing, like when Sargon describes.

1564
03:02:16,600 --> 03:02:21,600
When Sargon describes the.

1565
03:02:21,600 --> 03:02:27,600
I will when you get on Discord. Yeah, Sammy, get on Discord. Sammy, get on fucking Discord already.

1566
03:02:27,600 --> 03:02:32,600
God damn it. Sargon was on Lauren Chen's show talking about the slide from the rules of communism.

1567
03:02:32,600 --> 03:02:37,600
I mean, the thing the thing with Sargon is like that slide exists, but it's not inevitable.

1568
03:02:37,600 --> 03:02:42,600
And also, it seems to be the only thing he talks about right now. So it's like, come on, dude.

1569
03:02:42,600 --> 03:02:47,600
There's more there's more to the conversation than just that.

1570
03:02:47,600 --> 03:02:53,600
Anyway, you can now. Oh, God, my back.

1571
03:02:53,600 --> 03:03:02,600
OK. You can now request Google remove their personal sexually explicit explicit photos.

1572
03:03:02,600 --> 03:03:09,600
Google says it's meant to give users more control over content about themselves that is available through his popular search engine.

1573
03:03:09,600 --> 03:03:14,600
It is just one of the many things we're trying to do to help people feel control of their own experience.

1574
03:03:14,600 --> 03:03:19,600
One exception to the removal policy is if the user is actively commercializing their explicit images.

1575
03:03:19,600 --> 03:03:26,600
OK, so if you have nudes on the Internet, you're not a porn star because like a boyfriend leaked them or something.

1576
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:35,600
You can get them taken down. OK, that sounds pretty good. That sounds decent, doesn't it?

1577
03:03:35,600 --> 03:03:40,600
Hi, Sitch. Can't wait for your videos to return. It will be better than being here.

1578
03:03:40,600 --> 03:03:48,600
What the fuck, dude?

1579
03:03:48,600 --> 03:03:54,600
The company also introduced a new dashboard that tracks when a person's personal contact information appears in its search results,

1580
03:03:54,600 --> 03:04:03,600
which the company says will make it easier to users to monitor and request the removal information about themselves from Google search results.

1581
03:04:03,600 --> 03:04:08,600
That tool will now alert users when new results pop up containing contact information.

1582
03:04:08,600 --> 03:04:12,600
OK, this all seems like pretty good stuff, doesn't it?

1583
03:04:12,600 --> 03:04:17,600
This all seems pretty decent.

1584
03:04:17,600 --> 03:04:27,600
Ah, God damn it. Everything is just stretching. Oh, fuck.

1585
03:04:27,600 --> 03:04:34,600
Oh, ow, that hurt. Ow.

1586
03:04:34,600 --> 03:04:39,600
Oh. OK, hold on.

1587
03:04:39,600 --> 03:04:48,600
Yeah, I think I just pulled the muscle stretching or something.

1588
03:04:48,600 --> 03:04:53,600
OK, give me a second, give me a second, I'm just going to stretch it out.

1589
03:05:48,600 --> 03:06:17,600
I definitely did something.

1590
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:28,600
Oh. I did something quite painful to my thigh.

1591
03:06:28,600 --> 03:06:41,600
Oh. I like I was just stretching and then like it just I could feel the muscle seize and it's in the most incredible pain.

1592
03:06:41,600 --> 03:06:52,600
Oh. Oh.

1593
03:06:52,600 --> 03:07:00,600
Ah.

1594
03:07:00,600 --> 03:07:04,600
Rub it and stretch it, you'll be OK.

1595
03:07:04,600 --> 03:07:06,600
Hold on.

1596
03:07:06,600 --> 03:07:16,600
I, I grabbed some ibuprofen. Hold on. See, listen, I'll shake my pill bottle like Ethan Ralph ibuprofen.

1597
03:07:16,600 --> 03:07:22,600
Oh, OK, it's like, OK, this is like a really bad charley horse or something.

1598
03:07:22,600 --> 03:07:32,600
Oh.

1599
03:07:32,600 --> 03:07:41,600
Do not rub it if it's if it's in your leg, don't risk a DVT. It's not a DVT.

1600
03:07:41,600 --> 03:07:45,600
OK, hold on.

1601
03:07:45,600 --> 03:07:52,600
Such go watch my video and then you can demand things of me.

1602
03:07:53,600 --> 03:08:10,600
Mm hmm.

1603
03:08:10,600 --> 03:08:12,600
Oh.

1604
03:08:12,600 --> 03:08:24,600
Oh. Oh, fuck.

1605
03:08:24,600 --> 03:08:30,600
Hold on. I'm going to put my leg up.

1606
03:08:30,600 --> 03:08:43,600
Oh.

1607
03:08:43,600 --> 03:08:47,600
OK, OK. Did I miss a few super chats?

1608
03:08:47,600 --> 03:08:50,600
Did I miss some?

1609
03:08:50,600 --> 03:08:54,600
Hold on.

1610
03:08:54,600 --> 03:08:57,600
Let me go to the super chat.

1611
03:08:57,600 --> 03:09:02,600
Thanks for the support, though, guys, I appreciate it.

1612
03:09:02,600 --> 03:09:07,600
OK, hold on.

1613
03:09:07,600 --> 03:09:13,600
How much do you a yoga stream, says Holston, head or two dollars? Thank you.

1614
03:09:13,600 --> 03:09:16,600
Why are all the Sitch and Adam show crew wrench but me?

1615
03:09:16,600 --> 03:09:23,600
Dev, you're basically giving them permission to bully me, which is terribly illegal.

1616
03:09:23,600 --> 03:09:27,600
OK, did you have to convince me to rent you, I guess.

1617
03:09:27,600 --> 03:09:34,600
Donovan Gill, four dollar or five dollars, thank you, as a as a regular watcher of both Sargon and James Lidsey.

1618
03:09:34,600 --> 03:09:39,600
Very disappointed in James's response to Sargon. Yeah.

1619
03:09:39,600 --> 03:09:42,600
And me, too.

1620
03:09:42,600 --> 03:09:51,600
A DVT is a deep vein thrombosis.

1621
03:09:51,600 --> 03:09:55,600
Which I think is just like a blood clot, is that all it is?

1622
03:09:55,600 --> 03:10:00,600
DVT is like a type of blood clot, isn't it?

1623
03:10:00,600 --> 03:10:09,600
Yep, a DVT is occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein deep inside of your body.

1624
03:10:09,600 --> 03:10:14,600
Yeah.

1625
03:10:14,600 --> 03:10:18,600
Oh.

1626
03:10:18,600 --> 03:10:21,600
OK.

1627
03:10:21,600 --> 03:10:25,600
Oh.

1628
03:10:25,600 --> 03:10:30,600
Give me give me give me a second, OK, friends.

1629
03:10:30,600 --> 03:10:34,600
And where's where's where's did that? I don't see him.

1630
03:10:34,600 --> 03:10:39,600
Where's Diddler?

1631
03:10:43,600 --> 03:10:48,600
There he is, OK.

1632
03:10:48,600 --> 03:10:54,600
OK, Diddler. Oh, OK.

1633
03:10:54,600 --> 03:10:57,600
My first argument is that I'm a good boy who did nothing wrong.

1634
03:10:57,600 --> 03:11:00,600
My second is that Sammy cannot hold sway over me.

1635
03:11:00,600 --> 03:11:03,600
There is that sent you many gifts. Thank you, Diddler.

1636
03:11:03,600 --> 03:11:07,600
I appreciate it.

1637
03:11:07,600 --> 03:11:12,600
You know what I'll do? OK, we'll have to do some equivalent exchange here.

1638
03:11:12,600 --> 03:11:21,600
I'll have to I'll give Diddler Maude, but I'll have to remove Maude from Sammy instead.

1639
03:11:21,600 --> 03:11:29,600
Until she she redirects 10 percent of her fan art efforts towards my channel instead of Adam and Citrus.

1640
03:11:29,600 --> 03:11:33,600
That's how it has to be.

1641
03:11:33,600 --> 03:11:40,600
OK, let's see here.

1642
03:11:40,600 --> 03:11:47,600
Let's continue on. Sports Illustrated's entire staff told they're getting laid off.

1643
03:11:47,600 --> 03:11:52,600
Fuck you. The future of based.

1644
03:11:52,600 --> 03:12:03,600
The future of iconic magazine Sports Illustrated looked dire Friday after the publisher announced mass layoffs.

1645
03:12:03,600 --> 03:12:09,600
I don't have pinpoint chest pain. I'm fine. It's just the fact that there was a cramp in my leg is just a cramp.

1646
03:12:09,600 --> 03:12:17,600
It's just a cramp of the arena group, which has been roiled by reports that the fabled magazine published a generated content.

1647
03:12:17,600 --> 03:12:27,600
I admitted to failing to make a three point seven five million quarterly license payment to authentic brands group due this week.

1648
03:12:27,600 --> 03:12:35,600
As a result, the publicly traded arena announced Thursday would make significant reduction in its workforce of more than 100 journalists.

1649
03:12:35,600 --> 03:12:44,600
The unionized workers received a memo Friday telling them some employees will be terminated immediately and paid in lieu of a 60 day applicable notice period under the union contract.

1650
03:12:44,600 --> 03:12:48,600
Employees with the last working day of today will be contacted by the people team soon.

1651
03:12:48,600 --> 03:12:53,600
Other employees will be expected to work through the end of the notice period and receive additional information shortly.

1652
03:12:54,600 --> 03:12:59,600
Yep. This is happening to here's the yet notified.

1653
03:12:59,600 --> 03:13:04,600
You have to. Okay. So this happened to a lot of things right now. I might do a video.

1654
03:13:04,600 --> 03:13:09,600
Listen, what if I give money instead? Thanks, Sammy.

1655
03:13:09,600 --> 03:13:12,600
But I like your artwork, Sammy.

1656
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:20,600
Do I got to pay you for it? Do I got to pay you to do some art?

1657
03:13:20,600 --> 03:13:29,600
Oh, listen, Sports Illustrated entire staff like the thing about this is like.

1658
03:13:31,600 --> 03:13:37,600
OK, I think I think the pain is like fading slowly. OK, so.

1659
03:13:37,600 --> 03:13:47,600
Sports Illustrated entire staff, there's a lot of journalists, like journalists outlets right now, media sites and and publications.

1660
03:13:47,600 --> 03:13:52,600
They're just losing tons of people. Lots of social media. They're asking tons of people.

1661
03:13:52,600 --> 03:13:59,600
The layoffs are coming on and then all these useless fucking loser jobs where no one does anything of any fucking value.

1662
03:13:59,600 --> 03:14:05,600
They're all getting destroyed. And it's probably a good thing.

1663
03:14:05,600 --> 03:14:11,600
Inflation is down. The economy is great. Pay no attention to all the massive layoffs in every company in America.

1664
03:14:11,600 --> 03:14:15,600
Sigurður, listen, listen, they're cutting the fat. All right.

1665
03:14:15,600 --> 03:14:21,600
Remember that chick who like did nothing? It was an Instagram or wherever or wherever it was.

1666
03:14:21,600 --> 03:14:27,600
There was LinkedIn and she just walks around looking like looking really looking really suave or whatever the fuck.

1667
03:14:27,600 --> 03:14:31,600
And she's like wearing nice clothes. She's partying, constantly doing no fucking work.

1668
03:14:31,600 --> 03:14:36,600
She's constantly relaxing on the job, doing all this fucking bullshit and living the high life.

1669
03:14:36,600 --> 03:14:40,600
It's those people that are getting axed there. This is not part of the real economy.

1670
03:14:40,600 --> 03:14:46,600
They're just fucking money sinks. Eat a long yellow fruit. It'll help with cramps.

1671
03:14:46,600 --> 03:14:51,600
OK, thank you. Lives and does walls.

1672
03:14:51,600 --> 03:14:55,600
Wait, don't pay me, lol. It's more of a time issue for me than the motivation to do it.

1673
03:14:55,600 --> 03:15:09,600
OK. A third of Britons don't know that transgender women were born male.

1674
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:23,600
What? More than a third of UK residents do not know that transgender women are biologically male, according to a poll, calling into question public understanding of the debate over gender.

1675
03:15:23,600 --> 03:15:33,600
OK, so are we talking about people who are so ideologically captured, they think that trans they're like, no, biology doesn't exist.

1676
03:15:33,600 --> 03:15:46,600
They're all biologically female. Or are these people who are just so ignorant about trans stuff that they're like, trans women, is that like dudes who want to be girls?

1677
03:15:46,600 --> 03:15:56,600
I don't know. I don't know.

1678
03:15:56,600 --> 03:16:05,600
Campaigners said that the finding showed politicians, journalists and pollsters needed to be more explicit when speaking about gender issues.

1679
03:16:05,600 --> 03:16:10,600
As in many cases, members of the public did not know what the politically correct terms mean.

1680
03:16:10,600 --> 03:16:19,600
Hold on. 35% wrongly believe that a transgender woman was born female or that they were unsure.

1681
03:16:19,600 --> 03:16:30,600
The confusion was even greater for the shortened term of trans woman, with 40% either being unsure or believing it meant someone who is registered female at birth.

1682
03:16:30,600 --> 03:16:32,600
This is stupid.

1683
03:16:32,600 --> 03:16:39,600
This is dumb.

1684
03:16:39,600 --> 03:16:45,600
Actually, what what got Adam and Sitch fucked anyway?

1685
03:16:45,600 --> 03:16:54,600
NBM said several bodies such as the BBC regularly used terms that further explanation, for example, in stories about transgender participation in sports, the debate over self-id.

1686
03:16:54,600 --> 03:17:04,600
In many cases, the terms were adopted as a result of lobbying from trans activists who often claim it is discriminatory and offensive to refer to a transgender person's biological sex.

1687
03:17:04,600 --> 03:17:15,600
However, the poll said that there's high levels of misunderstanding and confusion with the terms, and there is a need for language to be more explicit.

1688
03:17:15,600 --> 03:17:20,600
We took it down. If you get a channel strike on YouTube and you can stream uploaded elsewhere, they can hit you with another penalty.

1689
03:17:20,600 --> 03:17:22,600
Yeah, if you like ban evade, you're fucked.

1690
03:17:22,600 --> 03:17:28,600
Such an Adam.

1691
03:17:28,600 --> 03:17:31,600
All right, so this is funny, but stupid. Got it.

1692
03:17:31,600 --> 03:17:34,600
It's pretty good.

1693
03:17:34,600 --> 03:17:40,600
Delivery driver caught dumping grocery order on the side of the road.

1694
03:17:40,600 --> 03:17:41,600
What?

1695
03:17:41,600 --> 03:17:47,600
Why?

1696
03:17:47,600 --> 03:17:53,600
A delivery driver has been has been spotted dumping a grocery order on the side of a dirt road by an angry onlooker.

1697
03:17:53,600 --> 03:18:01,600
The video filmed in Melbourne shows a small pile of groceries dumped on the side of the road with a delivery driver hunched over the bags.

1698
03:18:01,600 --> 03:18:04,600
Mate, I'm watching you. Of course, it's fucking Australian.

1699
03:18:04,600 --> 03:18:08,600
Mate, I'm watching you drop that rubbish there. What is it?

1700
03:18:08,600 --> 03:18:10,600
Shouldn't be going to a customer.

1701
03:18:10,600 --> 03:18:14,600
The driver said the order was going to a customer for picking up one of the Woolsworth bags.

1702
03:18:14,600 --> 03:18:21,600
There's not even a house here. What are you doing?

1703
03:18:21,600 --> 03:18:27,600
The delivery driver eventually picked up the items and put them back into the car, apologizing for getting in the driver's seat.

1704
03:18:27,600 --> 03:18:33,600
The footage was posted to a local Facebook group and woman commenting, confirming the order was hers.

1705
03:18:33,600 --> 03:18:37,600
OMG, my day keeps getting crazier.

1706
03:18:37,600 --> 03:18:43,600
This is my shopping, she added. She said, added that her order was delivered shortly after the video was filmed.

1707
03:18:43,600 --> 03:18:50,600
He sped up so fast and skidded on his way out, also reversing into a bush.

1708
03:18:50,600 --> 03:18:58,600
She ordered $100 worth of groceries, $15 for express delivery, and the driver's like, I'm just going to dump it on the side of the road.

1709
03:18:58,600 --> 03:19:01,600
What the fuck, dude?

1710
03:19:01,600 --> 03:19:08,600
And then the passerby caught it. But like, why?

1711
03:19:08,600 --> 03:19:15,600
Why, dude? Why?

1712
03:19:15,600 --> 03:19:22,600
Okay, you know what? Even though there's a few articles left, I think I'm going to pull the plug in this episode a little bit early.

1713
03:19:22,600 --> 03:19:28,600
It's time to put it down. I'll get to the articles next week.

1714
03:19:28,600 --> 03:19:30,600
Okay.

1715
03:19:30,600 --> 03:19:38,600
Ooh, ooh.

1716
03:19:38,600 --> 03:19:40,600
Yes.

1717
03:19:40,600 --> 03:19:43,600
Thanks for all the support, guys.

1718
03:19:43,600 --> 03:19:50,600
Oh, we are at $499.

1719
03:19:50,600 --> 03:19:54,600
We almost hit $500 of donations today, guys. Thank you very much.

1720
03:19:54,600 --> 03:19:59,600
That's very... I appreciate it quite a bit.

1721
03:19:59,600 --> 03:20:03,600
You're very appreciative.

1722
03:20:03,600 --> 03:20:10,600
But yes, I'm going to... Oh, Stug brings us over the line with a giant boo.

1723
03:20:10,600 --> 03:20:15,600
Listen, Sammy, Sammy, I don't know if you've been here the whole time. Did you see the big fight that I had earlier?

1724
03:20:15,600 --> 03:20:20,600
It's a fun fight. Like, I enjoy arguing with chat over stuff, but I think I helped.

1725
03:20:20,600 --> 03:20:26,600
Thanks very much, videosynth. Thank you.

1726
03:20:27,600 --> 03:20:30,600
But yeah, it wasn't a pulled muscle. It was intense.

1727
03:20:30,600 --> 03:20:34,600
No, no. Basically, yeah, my leg's actually mostly better.

1728
03:20:34,600 --> 03:20:39,600
Like, the pulled muscle was very painful for like 10 minutes. Like, it was fucked, but I'm actually doing pretty good now.

1729
03:20:39,600 --> 03:20:45,600
No, it's just... It's been three and a half hours. I do want to...

1730
03:20:45,600 --> 03:20:50,600
Sorry, I'm just breathing through my nose. I do want you to just get to some of the things today.

1731
03:20:50,600 --> 03:20:54,600
But thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate all the donos and all the help.

1732
03:20:54,600 --> 03:20:57,600
You guys are incredible. You guys are keeping things going.

1733
03:20:57,600 --> 03:21:03,600
Like I said, my goal is an extra 10,000 by the end of the... By the start of the spring.

1734
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:07,600
So you can actually set up... I'm setting up a studio. A real life studio, guys.

1735
03:21:07,600 --> 03:21:12,600
So that's the goal. So thank you very much for helping me get towards it. You guys are the best.

1736
03:21:17,600 --> 03:21:20,600
I'm just having some water.

1737
03:21:20,600 --> 03:21:23,600
Adam... No, sorry, Sitch. It's you, Sitch, who's in there, aren't you?

1738
03:21:23,600 --> 03:21:26,600
Unless he fucking left. He might have taken off.

1739
03:21:26,600 --> 03:21:34,600
But if you're still there, Sitch, you... No, Adam invited me on your channel in the near future.

1740
03:21:34,600 --> 03:21:37,600
Make sure you're not fucking banned when it comes time to have me on.

1741
03:21:40,600 --> 03:21:43,600
Make sure you're not fucking banned. Here, I'll type it.

1742
03:21:43,600 --> 03:21:55,600
Don't be banned when you want me on. Also, watch the video.

1743
03:22:01,600 --> 03:22:05,600
Anyway, thanks very much, guys. You guys are the best.

1744
03:22:06,600 --> 03:22:15,600
I've got to go. God damn it. I've got to go. We're going to go raid Chud Logic.

1745
03:22:15,600 --> 03:22:18,600
He's still online, right? Isn't he? Is Chud... Chud's a good boy.

1746
03:22:18,600 --> 03:22:21,600
Go in there and spam him with coffee cups because Chud's great.

1747
03:22:21,600 --> 03:22:28,600
We're going to go raid Chud. And I'll see you guys next time.

1748
03:22:28,600 --> 03:22:31,600
Actually, you know what? I'm like halfway done writing tomorrow's video.

1749
03:22:31,600 --> 03:22:34,600
So maybe... Actually, I'm actually back on track, okay?

1750
03:22:35,600 --> 03:22:40,600
Anyway. Oh, and yes, of course. For those of you who asked at the start of the stream,

1751
03:22:40,600 --> 03:22:46,600
I'm getting my medication checked out for tomorrow because I'm not going on that other shit again. Jesus.

1752
03:22:46,600 --> 03:22:51,600
Like, oh my God. Okay. Anyway, enough stalling. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

1753
03:22:54,600 --> 03:22:56,600
Was there anything else?

1754
03:22:56,600 --> 03:23:02,600
I know Kibz wanted to move the Project Zomboid stream to today, but I don't know if we're doing it.

1755
03:23:02,600 --> 03:23:04,600
I'm just going to ask him real quick.

1756
03:23:05,600 --> 03:23:08,600
Come on, Kibz. You fucking femboy.

1757
03:23:15,600 --> 03:23:17,600
I don't know.

1758
03:23:18,600 --> 03:23:23,600
Anyway, listen. Lots to do. I'm just distracting myself now.

1759
03:23:23,600 --> 03:23:26,600
I'll see you guys later, okay? Have a good one.

1760
03:23:28,600 --> 03:23:30,600
Fuck you.
