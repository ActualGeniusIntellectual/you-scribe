0	2000	Thank you.
30000	50000	Hello.
50000	52000	How's it going, guys?
52000	57000	Good morning.
57000	72000	I'm going to type this real quick, then I'll start, okay?
72000	74000	Hello.
74000	77000	I didn't know Arch was co-hosting today. No, no, no.
77000	79000	Arch isn't the furry.
79000	81000	V is the furry.
81000	93000	What's going on, guys?
93000	114000	Brent, you're here. Are you here to complain again?
114000	119000	Sorry, guys, I'm the reason I was late as I was talking to an artist.
119000	128000	And I'm just finishing up, you know, detailing the next the next art stuff for the channel. Here's the thing.
128000	130000	I want some new artwork.
130000	136000	You know, the the fat dev with the scrolling background, it's kind of overused at this point, I think.
136000	142000	I think I don't know if you guys agree, but like it's been around for three or four years now and I wanted something new.
142000	145000	So I decided to put some gameplay footage in.
145000	148000	The in yesterday's video.
148000	153000	And I think like there was a few complaints. Most people didn't seem to care, though, to be honest.
153000	157000	And I think most people just view me as like second monitor content anyway.
157000	163000	So it doesn't matter if I just have random gameplay footage in the background, but I just want something different.
163000	173000	I want I'm still I still I'm still going to use the fat dev with phone artwork for TikTok Tuesdays, but I want something different for the other videos.
173000	175000	And.
175000	179000	I got to figure out what I want to do, because.
179000	188000	Lots of lots of channels use random gaming footage, and I do like random gaming footage behind behind discussions of conversations.
188000	203000	But some people complained about it.
203000	207000	I do watch a lot of commentary slop anyways.
207000	212000	Don't commentary videos just have random gaming footage anyway in the back in the background?
212000	215000	Isn't that the case?
215000	221000	I don't quite know what the commentary community is, but.
221000	236000	Oh, yeah, the the dev walking up the background for that one covid video, I was intending to do a covid series and I got sidetracked.
236000	243000	Displayed two random game in the split screen track TikTok.
243000	250000	Oh, because here's the thing I like using gameplay footage when I'm talking about like gaming or YouTube being or drama.
250000	255000	Right. Because that kind of feels like it when I did the Skullgirls video gameplay footage was fine.
255000	260000	When I did the Final Fantasy video gameplay footage was fine. I did a.
260000	266000	I'm probably gonna do a video on Capcom soon. And for that just random gameplay, random gameplay footage is fine.
266000	276000	But to be honest, it felt very strange to put random gameplay footage in a discussion about political theory.
276000	281000	That sound that felt very strange. You know what I mean? It didn't feel right.
281000	294000	I thought I thought I would like it, but I kind of didn't. But I still want a different. I still want something different for the background.
294000	310000	I guess the issue is. I'm not sure how much I want to invest in this sort of thing anyway, because I might be radically changing my setup when I move in a few months anyway, because I'm moving come springtime, probably April or May.
310000	321000	So if I radically change my setup and I can actually, you know, let's say I lose some weight and I can actually be on camera and be presentable and not be a fat fuck.
321000	327000	Then maybe I wouldn't even use a background. You know what I mean?
327000	332000	I don't know. I still I still got to think about it.
332000	344000	I know like it's a Gundam alternates between, you know, animations or drawings of his character and also random gameplay footage.
344000	352000	I think what like I think what it's a Gundam does stylistically is what I would like to do with some of it with some of my videos.
352000	361000	I just don't have the time or the manpower or the patience, frankly.
361000	368000	You become a vtuber. I don't know what that did.
368000	377000	Who knows? Maybe I'll just make like a v tube avatar of just like my fat dev self anyway.
377000	384000	As for a camera, I mean, I don't know. I've also considered doing more streams.
384000	391000	I mean, the weekly zip is coming up on 200 and I set an informal goal for myself that.
391000	405000	I would change the format of my of my streaming stuff at 200 and my plan, I think my plan was basically just to stream more.
405000	416000	All right.
416000	424000	I got like a bunch of ideas and they're all kind of disorganized and they're kind of pulling me all in different directions, you know.
424000	429000	And some of them involve artwork. Some of them involve me getting on a camera.
429000	433000	I don't quite know what I want to do yet.
433000	439000	Can't accuse Dev of being a tourist who becomes a vtuber.
439000	443000	Yes, couples are still in the works that will come eventually.
443000	448000	Yeah, gameplay footage works better for indefensible. I agree with that. I agree with that.
448000	453000	Like I tried to do it yesterday and I thought I would like it. I didn't like it, you know, so I got to find something else.
453000	457000	I got to figure something else out.
457000	464000	In fact, you know what, I might even just message Gundam and ask him how he does it, you know.
464000	471000	Like who he got to do it, maybe that'll help.
471000	480000	Coffee's good, guys. Coffee's good.
480000	486000	OK, what else is happening? What else is going on?
486000	490000	Hold on, let's pause this.
490000	494000	Yeah, I'll figure something else. I'll figure something out, I'm sure.
494000	500000	I have like, it's kind of strange because like all the ideas are like half formed and they're all interesting.
500000	510000	But I'm not sure I have enough time to do them all and I want to do them all. You know what I mean?
510000	513000	Do reading footage.
513000	524000	Kefl's did a stream with Chris Chan. It's so over. Thanks for the two dollars, Rusta. Appreciate it, buddy.
524000	529000	Well, I have I have Gundams like like DMS. I can talk to him whenever I like.
529000	533000	So the almighty loli doesn't like me.
533000	543000	Yes, like the almighty loli is part of like that, that group of people who did not like the fact.
543000	554000	That that I basically said that V tube simps were simps, so.
554000	561000	Oh, also, I'm not sure that I'm not sure I know who meant his way this, to be honest, I don't know who that is.
561000	568000	But like, basically, I have like an idea for like a series of different types of content, right?
568000	576000	And so the gaming footage with maybe a bit more editing quality talking about gaming related issues.
576000	580000	That'd be like one series and then me talking about like the ten minute takes videos.
580000	585000	That'll be like a different series. It'll have like a background or something, right?
585000	590000	And if I can fit all. Here's the thing. Also, I need more staff, right?
590000	594000	Dave does a lot of good work, but it's not cutting it anymore. I need more.
594000	601000	The need to the channel guys, if you don't mind, I would say that like my goal.
601000	604000	In order to be able to afford to.
604000	613000	To be able to afford to move and set up my studio once I move, I probably need another like $10,000.
613000	620000	So that'll be my goal to push towards. Over the next four months or so.
620000	623000	I don't know, Dave's not going anywhere. They're not going anywhere. I don't mean to say that.
623000	633000	What I mean to say is like, Dave, I need more help than just what Dave can provide.
633000	636000	We donate to does not become a simp. Got it. No diverse simps.
636000	639000	That's like you saying they're just like your average Twitch thought that pisses us off.
639000	643000	A lot of them are. A lot of them just are like the average Twitch thought, dude.
643000	646000	Just simple. That's how it is, dude.
646000	650000	I mean, I can give you the argument that I gave V yesterday. It was a pretty good argument.
650000	654000	I think he ignored it. I think it was a good argument.
654000	657000	Like here. Here.
657000	661000	OK, I'm going to show you. I'm sure you want to talk about. OK.
661000	665000	So listen.
665000	668000	OK.
668000	671000	You have Emirates, right?
671000	676000	And she's in her tub with the bathing suit on.
676000	681000	And she's taking donos and she's writing names on her arm.
681000	685000	For four donations, you have Amaranth.
685000	689000	And then you have Dodger.
689000	695000	And Dodger just kind of plays the games that she wants to play whenever she wants to do it in her room.
695000	701000	She doesn't she doesn't do the Twitch thought thing, but she is, you know, an attractive woman on the Internet.
701000	704000	So.
704000	711000	What's the difference between these two? I mean, there's clearly a difference, right?
711000	718000	Despite them both being attractive women on the Internet who live off of Twitch and who get money from donations.
718000	727000	What's what's the difference between them? You know, there's there's clearly a spectrum of thought and nonthought.
727000	738000	Right. There's clearly a spectrum. And even though you can't cleanly draw the line between the two daughters married, even when Dodger wasn't married, though.
738000	743000	Also, Amaranth is a boyfriend. Amaranth is a fucking boyfriend, dude.
743000	751000	Or is she married now, too? I don't fucking know. The point is, is that even though you have these two extremes, right?
751000	761000	Thought and nonthought and that there's like a gradient between them where where a woman can be like slightly more thought like as they move towards the other pole.
761000	770000	But just because there's a gradient and the line between them is blurry doesn't mean that there's not two obvious ends, right?
770000	777000	Dodger is not simp baiting. That's a big part of it, isn't it? Now, listen.
778000	791000	Lots of V tubers, lots of V tubers, even the ones who market themselves as pure or at least non lewd, they definitely simply they definitely simply.
791000	806000	All right. With with the you know, with with the extremely attractive, almost almost perfect picture ask model with the very different, generally higher pitched, generally cuter voice.
806000	814000	When they get a donation. Absolutely. They absolutely simply simple as that. Simple as that. Right.
814000	827000	And so I mentioned this to V and V said, well, you know, there's also a similar spectrum between like Vash and Hassan and people like me or him.
827000	831000	Right. Which is true because there is this spectrum.
831000	839000	But then I told him, like, listen, you're making my point back to me because you know what happens when Vash gets a donation?
839000	843000	He says, thank you for the donation, comrade. Get ready for the revolution.
843000	851000	We're all going to be out there like like Vash. He's not simp baiting in the same way, like appealing to your deck, but he is appealing to your sensibilities.
851000	858000	All right. There's this feeling, at least in terms of how Vash talks to his donators.
858000	863000	That he's going to be there with you for the revolution and that you're donating for the revolution.
863000	868000	But I mean, we all know that if the communist revolution comes.
868000	873000	Watch isn't going to be there. You know, Vash Vash's parents worked in Hollywood.
873000	879000	He grew up in Beverly Hills. He lives in a gated community in San in Seattle now.
879000	885000	Like Vash is going to be on the fucking street fighting with a revolution.
885000	890000	He's not going to be fucking there.
890000	907000	So this idea that like he like Vash doesn't do the simp baiting in the same way as like appealing to some sexual sensibility or even some like girlfriend experience or some like you have to take care of me because I'm the cute girl.
907000	912000	Like like quasi Tamagotchi experience like like the NPC memes do right.
912000	926000	Vash doesn't do that, but he does appeal to the sensibilities of of his, you know, like his sad communist revolutionary or quasi revolutionary hopeful failed revolutionary audience.
926000	933000	Right. Like whenever I talk to you guys about donating, I appreciate the donations you give me.
933000	940000	But I also constantly say don't donate to me if you can't afford it.
940000	951000	In fact, like here there are there are things that I could do to get more money out of you guys that would be duplicitous and would be immoral and that I won't do them.
951000	956000	You understand? So this is what I'm talking about.
956000	961000	OK.
961000	965000	Hold on.
965000	972000	What's your opinion on Thomas Hobbes? He's all right.
972000	976000	He's right about some things wrong, but other things. Thanks for thanks for the 10.
976000	984000	I'm sorry. Appreciate it, dude.
984000	991000	Isn't that just appealing to demographic them? Why call it simp baiting?
991000	996000	Because there's a duplicitousness in it.
996000	1002000	Like I could I could be here and like every time you guys donate to me, I can be like, yeah, thanks. Thanks, dude.
1002000	1005000	Guess what? We're going to go. You know what this donation is going towards? We're going to go.
1005000	1011000	We're going to revitalize centrism. Liberalism is going to be OK. We're going to be like I could or I could even I can even go further.
1011000	1016000	Right. I know that that a lot of you guys are more right wing than me. I could be like, keep donating, guys.
1016000	1020000	I'll turn more right wing if you keep donating. I'll start supporting the alt right.
1020000	1023000	Or else we're going to the dissident, right, guys, like I'll start like.
1023000	1032000	There's like it would be more sophisticated than that, obviously, I'm just speaking off the cuff, but the point is, is that I could say things that.
1032000	1036000	Either would be directly false or.
1036000	1040000	That would be.
1040000	1048000	That would imply something that I don't mean, but that you would think that I mean, and I would have plausible deniability.
1048000	1053000	All right, because lots of streamers do that.
1053000	1055000	Lots of streamers do that.
1055000	1061000	And I don't do that and I refuse to do that.
1061000	1063000	You know.
1063000	1075000	You wouldn't know that since you like here, like Lord Boneman, like you're kind of like, why even here?
1075000	1089000	Are you actually just here to put words in my mouth?
1089000	1105000	There is an honesty knowing that my money only goes to you. You don't want to be the completionist. Yeah. Oh, fuck that. That's a great example. The completionist. Holy shit.
1105000	1113000	Probably is a bigger than a bigger than most of you. Do you think so? I don't know.
1113000	1119000	Here's the thing, right? You have you have like a cute girl, especially if it's a cute anime girl, because then it's unrealistic.
1119000	1129000	And every time you donate, she squeaks, she changes her voice. She tells you, oh, just how thankful she is for it. And she does a little dance and her model jiggles around.
1129000	1140000	Are you are you seriously fucking saying there's it's all above board. Nothing's being implied there. Nothing's like there's nothing. There's no subtext to that whatsoever.
1140000	1153000	Like if you if you're saying that you're fucking coping, right? You're just fucking coping. And in fact, you're probably locked in to being a simp.
1153000	1165000	And here's the thing, like, because of the way that these online conversations and arguments go, a lot of you guys in like, here, like, like, valiant just did it.
1165000	1176000	If YouTube are genuine enough by your stand, then they're okay. Yes. Yes, valiant. That's exactly the point. Because here's the thing. I never said all V tubers. All right.
1177000	1193000	Like, you're unironically doing the hashtag, like I have to do the fucking hashtag not all V tubers thing the way we did like fucking hashtag not all men before because feminists are being retarded about men. And now you're being retarded about V tubers. You understand?
1193000	1202000	Someone said in the chat, the only vtuber I watch is Pippa, she's called the Vasha horse. It was actually really funny. All right. There are actually V tubers that I like.
1202000	1231000	But this there's an idea that like, I just, oh, God, people say that, like, dev supported the harassment against pick me. Like, how could you possibly fucking come out with that? Like, you have to be retarded. I hate to just toot my own horn, but it sometimes just seems like, am I am I just like, smarter than the average person online? Is that it? Are most people on the internet? Is that fucking dumb? Or that fucking dishonest?
1232000	1234000	Like, is that what most humans are?
1247000	1250000	Fuck. So how's that? Is that my waifu?
1250000	1275000	But anyway, like, I don't like, I'm not a thought leader, not the head of any sort of political movement.
1276000	1295000	I certainly can't give you guys a girlfriend experience. I can't say, Hey, if you if you donate to me enough, maybe I'll fuck you. I can't do that. I certainly don't don't make make you guys think that you can care for me like a Tamagotchi by donating, right? All of those avenues are cut off.
1295000	1324000	The only thing I do is like, you can support me, I'll keep making videos. That's what you get for your support. It's a transaction, right? And I'm not gonna I'm not gonna coach that transaction in any sort of other emotional appeal, whether that is political, or sexual, because I think that's a moral. All right. And in so far, as other streamers do that, lots of women do it.
1325000	1338000	Lots of politics streamers do it. And lots of vtubers do it. But in so far as they do it, I think that they're acting immorally. And I won't do it. It's as simple as that.
1338000	1362000	What else? What else is happening? Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. So I mentioned, if you guys remember last week, last week, I was like, Dude, getting on the ADHD meds was amazing.
1362000	1374000	Remember that shit, guys. So I was given one week of 10 milligrams of Vyvanse, and then five weeks of 20 milligrams of Vyvanse. Okay.
1374000	1397000	Hold on, Brian Linden, $5. Thank you. Now what you need to do to get more money from us is to be wrong on purpose to bait us into arguing. Also, pick me election stolen and died suddenly. Oh, my God. Thanks for the fiber, dude.
1397000	1426000	So so stretching. Oh, okay. So Vyvanse, right. When I was on the week of 10 milligrams of Vyvanse, I felt fucking incredible. My ability to focus was drastically improved. I could stick to writing. I could stick to reading. I could stick to writing.
1426000	1452000	I could stick to reading. I could actually click complete books in one sitting. I could like I could get on with like writing a long script. No problem. I could actually work. And now, without the Vyvanse, I can work about 30% of the time at that level. With the Vyvanse, it was more like 75 to 80% of the time. It was excellent. And I was like, Yes. Oh, I can finally do all the things that I want to do.
1452000	1474000	So Dylan Bowser, welcome. Let's get this sip, boys. But the cringe article is the next level this week. Thanks. Thanks, Bowser. Do a long $5.00. Hey, Dev, any plans on doing a deep dive in accelerationism? Catch you on the replay. One day. Yes. Because I don't like accelerationism on either side. So, yes.
1475000	1501000	Here's the thing. Um, but then after the week of 10 milligrams, it was time for me to step up to 20 milligrams. And on 20 milligrams. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Everything was worse. Everything was worse than then. It was worse than me at baseline, like without medication. It was fucking terrible.
1501000	1521000	Oh, my God. It was really bad. It was really bad. So people saying it's math. It's math. It's math. It's like it's related to math, but it's not the same as math. Everyone does the joke. It's math, but it's related, but not the same drug. The nobody care. What's this?
1522000	1537000	Going tomorrow. Titanium. Why is Biden lesser evil compared to Orange? Mainly because of the Eastman memo. That's the main reason. The Eastman memo is why I think that Biden is the lesser evil compared to Trump.
1537000	1565000	So here, here, here. Here's Here's the situation here. Titanium knows what's going on because titanium is also on on Vyvanse. So let me describe it to you. Okay. So in general, Vyvanse. Okay. Here's the TLD of how it works. Right. I think I think I said this last week, but I'll say it again real quick this week is that if you have ADHD, you're like looking around, you can't keep your focus on anything because everything is so stimulating.
1565000	1589000	Right. So basically what you do is it lowers your threshold for no, you know, everything is boring, but that's what it is. Everything's boring. So you're constantly being stimulated by a new thing. So what it does is it lowers your threshold for stimulation. Right. So basically, if you must sit down and do a long job, it takes longer for that job to get boring.
1590000	1617000	It remains interesting for long periods of time. That's that's what that's what the drug does, basically. So the you're able to write and read, and just generally focus on things better and not be sucked in to like constantly snacking every time you walk through the kitchen, right, or get hooked into addictive video games for hours and hours and hours because it has such a strong reward pathway. Right.
1618000	1619000	So.
1622000	1628000	And honestly, a lot of the stuff you can actually just kind of like learn good habits and muscle through on your own.
1630000	1635000	But but sometimes you can't get all the way there. So I wanted I wanted to try it. I want to try it. I gave it a go.
1635000	1636000	I gave it a go.
1641000	1642000	And so what ends up happening.
1643000	1648000	Is you have the side effects of high blood pressure, which kind of sucks for a fat guy like me.
1649000	1652000	No appetite, which is pretty good for a fat guy like me.
1654000	1663000	And so on the 10 milligrams, I was doing all the work. It was amazing. My life was measurably improved. I had no appetite, which was good.
1663000	1672000	And the high blood pressure symptoms were minimal. So it's like, okay, you know, I'll, I'll lose weight and deal with that on its own. Not a big deal. Right.
1673000	1682000	I didn't experience any loss of creativity, which is a common side effect that I didn't experience. And I didn't experience any any anxiety, which is a common side effect. Okay.
1682000	1690000	So like, things were perfect. Then I then I jump up to the 20. And on the 20.
1692000	1697000	The high blood pressure symptoms were constant and very uncomfortable. They never went away.
1698000	1700000	They were just there all the time. And I just felt terrible.
1701000	1706000	And also lots of anxiety. And I don't have anxiety.
1706000	1718000	Normally, like without medication, I'm not I'm not a person who ever gets anxiety. I am not an I am not a person who is prone to getting anxiety. But I had it on this. I had a whole bunch of anxiety.
1719000	1731000	And I was like, Oh, my God. And it doesn't matter that like, my focus was still improved. Like I was a fucking wreck. I couldn't do anything on the 20. And I was like, Oh, my God, this is like, this is fucking. Oh, my God.
1731000	1752000	It was terrible. And so I was like, you know what? I'll keep trying. Maybe maybe I just got to get used to the the 20 mgs. Right? I'll just I'll just keep trying. So I just muscled through it for like three or four days. And it didn't get any better. I was just like, Oh, my fucking God.
1753000	1776000	In fact, one of the reasons why I'm not happy with the editing job on the video that came out yesterday is because I forced myself to edit it while I was in this terrible state. I was like, you know what, I need to get this video out. I just need to fucking do it. So I've just forced myself to just it's like just the bare minimum. Just get all the fucking things on screen. Fuck it. Just just get it out. And I'm not happy with what I did with it. But it's out. Okay.
1776000	1805000	Okay. Um, so I'm just like, Oh, I stopped. I didn't take any today. I didn't take any today. I'm going the doctors is open tomorrow. I'm going back. I'm going to be like, Listen, put me back on the 10. And that'll be that. However, the only the only issue is that 10 milligrams is not considered a normal dose.
1806000	1833000	Here, maybe it is somewhere else in the world. But like, 10 milligrams is what you give the children, or it's what you give to adults to eventually boost them up to something higher. It's not considered a dose you should stay on. But so I'm going to tell them though, like, Listen, either you put me on the 10, or I just I'll just take the 20s for you. And I'll just start cutting them in half. Because I'm not doing that again. Fuck. Oh, my God. So here's the issue.
1834000	1844000	It didn't really screw with my mind. All the symptoms I'm describing are like body or like body symptoms, right? It was like body anxiety. It was all stuff happening in my body, but my mind was pretty much intact.
1848000	1858000	$5 stigma. Thank you. Almost every med I've ever taken that messes with brains have always been at about half the dosage for my weight. Really? Yeah. Maybe I'm just I'm just very sensitive to it, you know.
1858000	1864000	But yeah, I'm going to try to get I'm going to try to stay at the 10.
1869000	1879000	If they if they say no, we will only give you prescriptions for 20s, then I'll take the 20s and I'll cut them in half. But I'm staying at 10. Fuck that.
1889000	1911000	So that's what I'm doing. So today, I'm not on any of the medication. And I'm certainly feeling better than when I was in the 20. That's for sure. Also, for everyone saying it was meth. There's like, there's no like, there's no addictive property to this.
1912000	1926000	Like, I don't feel the urge to like, take the pill or anything. I don't feel I don't feel I don't like miss any of what I was feeling. I'm just like, that sucked. I won't do that again. Like, there's nothing addictive here. You know what I mean?
1927000	1928000	So I'm just like, Okay.
1930000	1931000	All right.
1942000	1945000	So yes, that's the current situation with me and the drugs.
1946000	1951000	Yet. Yeah, but it's been almost two weeks of me doing this. I figured there'd be something.
1951000	1952000	I figured there'd be something.
1959000	1973000	I'm lucky, maybe because those are slow. Also, to be honest, I never really got addicted to alcohol or weed, even though trying those as well. I tried smoking, didn't get into smoking.
1974000	1982000	Even maybe I just don't have an addictive personality. Well, to be fair, I do have an addictive personality. But it's towards food and video games. It's not towards any sort of drug.
1986000	1988000	Devo three years later, I can quit at any time.
1990000	1992000	How would you recommend including sleep schedule? Here's what I do.
1993000	2002000	I open the windows, and I allow the sun to shine into the room as I wake up. And I wake up with the sun. It's quite nice.
2003000	2015000	I can't wait to take this bill. That's not how it works. I'm not feeling it at all, dude.
2022000	2027000	I understand titanium, and that's probably what it was. That's probably what it was. But you know what? Right now, I feel better.
2028000	2033000	Right now, I feel better. I'll go back and get tens, and it'll probably be okay.
2034000	2040000	So what else do I want to talk about before we start? Well, we're already starting. I mean, I guess this is definitely part of the show, isn't it?
2040000	2058000	Oh, yeah. I don't know. I think, like, sometimes the amount of haters that I get, and I get my fair share of them, for sure. More so now than before.
2059000	2065000	Probably because of, like, Pick Me, Trucker Video, all that stuff. But the amount of haters that I get is sometimes disheartening, you know what I mean?
2065000	2075000	And in terms of the pure, raw numbers calculus, it doesn't matter. Like, I can do... Hold on. Jess, I haven't sent dollars. Thank you.
2076000	2090000	I think with meth is the active ingredient, which is an amphetamine. My friend who takes the meds has to tell how employers this, because drug tests look for the ingredient and flag it as meth. Makes sense. I know what you mean, yeah.
2091000	2101000	Okay. I do hate or bait sometimes, and sometimes it's really fun, right? But sometimes, like, I'll talk to people and they're just retarded and they want me to agree with them.
2102000	2113000	And when I don't agree with them, they take it personally. Like, the amount of right-wingers in the past, let's say, year, it's been slowly ramping up over a year.
2113000	2122000	The amount of right-wingers who legitimately hate me because I don't agree with their takes has kind of gone through the roof.
2123000	2140000	And it's gotten to the point where I do not care to cater to them anymore. I was like, well, fuck you. You know what I mean? Like, it's not just that you gave a take I disagree with. They act like they've been personally attacked by me.
2140000	2155000	No, no. I'm sure it's not me. Yes. And here's why. Because when I disagree with someone, that's a disagreement, right? When I have a take that you don't like, when you have a take that I don't like, we disagree.
2156000	2166000	Okay, we disagree. Fine. We disagree. And we can have a discussion and we can go like, okay, well, here's a point. Here's a point. Here's what I think of your point. Here's some proof. Here's some evidence. Here's some numbers. We can have the discussion and work it out, right?
2166000	2181000	However, there are people who I give a take they don't like, and then they morally attack me. Or they say, I can't believe you've changed up, even though I haven't really changed.
2182000	2190000	Or they'll say, I can't believe you were a liberal dev, even though I've always said I was a liberal. Or they'll make a big show about no longer watching. Right?
2191000	2213000	And then it's just like, what should I do with this? Like, what should I fucking do with this guys? Like, it's one thing like here. All right. One of my mods, one of my mods is Avalon Apple. And he disagrees with me more than most people. He's constantly sending me shit about why I'm wrong.
2214000	2225000	And yet I still consider him a friend. And I still take his opinion seriously, even though we disagree. And there's no hate between us. All right. You understand?
2226000	2249000	Compare that to someone who is like, Oh, this video critiqued my point of view, I need to make a very public I need to make a very public statement about how you don't understand that the West has fallen and I'm on subbing from you. And I can't wait until you're completely destroyed. It's like, what the fuck? What the fuck? What's wrong with you?
2249000	2278000	That riff person, so we will make their opinions part of their identity and take a person we don't confirm that part of their reality. That's true. That's true. But it's also it's also the fact that there's, again, a weird parasocial thing that some people have adopted. All right, like, and this is why I'm very sensitive about all the people who push the simp shit.
2279000	2308000	From that previous conversation, and why specifically do my best not to push it as much as I can. All right. Because there have been people who have taken it like a personal attack, like I've backstabbed them. Like I've betrayed our friendship, which doesn't really exist, because I like you guys, but like, you're also viewers, you know, you're not you're not like on the same level as Naomi, for example, or Dave, you know, I don't know you in real life. But they think it's like this incredible, like betrayal.
2309000	2315000	That I would give a take that criticizes them. It's like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
2316000	2336000	person. Thank you. Some people will make their opinions part of their identity and take it personally. We don't have from that part of the reality. Yep. That's for sure. $20. Some territory. Thank you very much, man. When people start to substitute their, their politics with personality, how else can they take a difference of opinion other than a personal attack? Yeah, exactly. Right. Exactly. And right wingers are doing that, too. Yeah.
2336000	2365000	Destiny's approach of purging fans every time you get a huge influx to remind them of your actual takes is based. There's like a balance there fable. I agree with you, by the way, the balance is like, you can purge fans. But if you're like, if you're small, and you purge too hard, you destroy your own growth, right? But then you also have the problem of being captured. Like what if it turns out that you give one take that is not in line with your other takes. And now you gained a bunch of people who you don't actually agree with. And they're all following you now. And they're all just ranting at you, because you don't agree with them.
2366000	2396000	Because you because they thought you were somebody else, you know what I mean? Like, if you're a left winger, and you give one right, one take that right wingers like, and now like 90% of your audience is right wingers. And you have to be like, Listen, I don't fucking believe this shit. And then you're constantly fighting with them or the opposite to like, when a right winger gives a take that left wingers like you know what I mean? So, for me, it's like, I'm a liberal, I've always been a liberal. Liberalism will sometimes agree with the left and sometimes agree with the right. And so when you come in here, and you see, like, if you're a right
2396000	2426000	winger, and you see a right wing take, and you're like, Yeah, devs based. And the next day, I give I give a take against the right, and you like, fly off the handle of like, how you've been betrayed. Like, I just have no patience for that anymore. All right. I have no patience with that anymore. I'm at the point now where it's like, if I were to purge my entire audience, like here, most of you guys are pretty cool, right? Most of you guys are pretty cool. Most of you guys are pretty cool. However, if it turned out that you
2426000	2456000	all went full retard, and I had to purge all of you, and I went back down to being like a 20 viewer fucking politics streamer, I would do that. Because, yeah, if I gotta get another job, I'll get another job. You know, I do not want to be beholden to saying things I don't believe.
2456000	2471600	Like people online. They say I love you a lot. I was stretching Zamze or Zamze. Yeah.
2473680	2485600	Like here, here. I'm gonna show you examples what I mean. I got a few examples because this has been happening like a lot in the past a little bit and I'm just fucking done with it. And since since 2024 is going to be the dev authoritarian year.
2486480	2497760	I'm going to be done with people like this. All right. Hold on. Let me see here. Let me see. Like.
2500800	2507760	Listen, five dollars. I heard you like strawberry ice cream. I'm on subbing and hoping that you lose everything for your insane fruit ice cream views. Rocky road for life.
2507760	2514880	Give me, let me pull this up.
2518320	2522720	Tara Shevanka, five dollars. And some of you guys are cool. Don't change the stream tomorrow.
2525040	2532560	Okay. Here we go. Like this guy, right? So what's going on here?
2532560	2542480	Is Tim Pool's complaining about has been hotel, right? Oh, hey, Apple's ghost.
2545200	2549120	Apples, do you wind it? I talked about you recently. Just rewind a bit and listen to it.
2553680	2556800	There's a low pay five dollars judging by the comments. I feel like you didn't make it clear
2556800	2559520	in your video that the current liberals aren't liberals, but other progressives.
2559520	2564480	That's true. Lots of people are progressive liberals, not like classical liberals or social
2564480	2567200	liberals or conservative liberals. They're progressives. And that's the problem.
2568720	2571280	And even then, I still have progressive friends because why not?
2571280	2574000	Photography, five dollars. I'm conservative with you all the time, but I always listen.
2574000	2577120	I always appreciate your positivity. I'm tired of the doomer right takes. Same here, man.
2578560	2583360	Clear to clearly come be at two dollars. Deb, become a VTuber with bad A.I.H. art from members.
2583360	2590800	OK, OK, thanks, guys. Thank you. So listen. Tim Pool. Outrage over Amazon
2590800	2594880	show praising Lucifer. Yeah, yeah, whatever. OK. And then this random fucking person shows up.
2595600	2600080	I'm talking about something else. And he says, where's the trucker video? All right.
2600640	2606160	And this happens fucking constantly. All right. And there's this belief among
2607360	2611440	a portion of my audience and also a portion of people who used to be my audience,
2611440	2617040	but have since moved on. And they think like Dev is avoiding the trucker video
2617600	2623280	because he actually uncovered the truth. And what it is, is that his politics and ideas are wrong
2623280	2629120	and he can't spin it any other way. So he has to just not talk about it. He can't bring it up.
2629120	2632880	He has to be. And I'm just like, no, I'm lazy. That's all it is. I'm just lazy.
2633920	2639120	There's no underlying other explanation. I'm just being lazy.
2639120	2646880	That's it. That's it. Dev, it's a meme. Here's the thing. It's not just a meme.
2648320	2657360	It's not just the meme, though, because I started a counter meme of plus one day. Every time someone
2657360	2663360	mentions the trucker video, I say plus one day. And now we have people who are unsubscribing,
2663360	2667200	right? Like this guy. And I just said, get the fuck out. Right. And he gave me some long fucking
2667200	2672240	leftist meme. It goes on and on and on like a giant thread about why, you know, Oh my God,
2672240	2676480	I can't believe I sunk so much time into you. And I can't like, you're like, fuck you.
2677120	2683760	Unsubscribe. All right. Just get the fuck out. Just get out. Like this shit honestly kind of
2683760	2689840	pisses me off. The announcing that you're unsubscribing or like announcing that you're
2689840	2693360	leaving the stream to go watch somebody else's stream shit like that. It's like, listen,
2694240	2702000	listen, guys, I want you to understand this is not an airport. All right. You don't need to announce
2702000	2708640	your fucking departure. Just go away. It's as simple as that. If you don't want to, if you're
2708640	2716080	pissed at me and you want to have a conversation about our, about our disagreement, that's one
2716080	2722800	thing, but to declare that I am, I am now moving on. Good. Get out. So look at this
2722800	2726400	minus one subscriber. I mean, you're not a viewer of mine. You're not a viewer.
2726400	2729600	Why should I care what you think? There you go.
2738800	2742400	And yes, here's the thing. Sometimes it is just a meme, right? Sometimes it is just a meme and
2742400	2746400	that's fine. Like that's okay. We can meme it up, but there are some people who are taking it
2746400	2750160	serious and I'm just fucking done with them. I'm done with pandering to them. I'm done with their
2750160	2753680	fucking, their dumb bullshit where they come in and they're always like demanding shit of me.
2753680	2758800	Get the fuck out. All right. I'm done with it. Antelope, the Greek $2. What do you think of
2758800	2764080	Georgism? I actually do like Georgism. Georgism is interesting. All right. But I want to do a
2764080	2766800	video on it someday. So I'm not going to talk about it just yet, but I do like it.
2766800	2773680	Viewers who try to control the creator. Yeah, exactly. I tell them, I keep saying this shit,
2773680	2775840	like I'm going to make whatever content I want to make.
2780880	2784480	Like, and if you, if you don't want to watch it, then don't watch it. That's fine.
2788640	2794000	But I'm going to do what I want to do because it's my channel. And if you don't want to watch,
2794000	2798240	if it's not for you, then it's not for you, but it's for me. That's, that's the important part.
2798240	2803200	And like, you see stuff like this pretty, pretty commonly. There's no, I see stuff like this
2803200	2808640	commonly is what I mean in my fucking comments. Like here, this is, this is the video that I just
2808640	2817200	put out 17 hours ago. Okay. Here's the, it's the new video. And this guy says, I'm sorry, Dev,
2817200	2822320	but you've ever so slowly lost all the qualities I thought made you good over the last few years.
2822320	2827280	And as a result, I'm unsubscribing. Wish you the best, but I don't want to stay on this ride.
2828400	2835520	I mean, one, I haven't changed. So I don't know what qualities I've lost. I've done the,
2835520	2839840	I've, I've had the exact same takes and done the exact same stuff this whole time,
2840800	2846400	but two, okay, just go like, just, just, just, just get the fuck out.
2846400	2850720	I don't even know what he's talking about here. Like,
2850720	2854400	is this like a lefty who has been around and he thinks I'm too right wing?
2855120	2859120	Is this like a right winger? Who's like, I don't, I don't even know what fucking side this guy's on,
2861200	2863440	but it's like, just, just go, just leave.
2867280	2874080	And here's the thing. I'm not even doing the, the total biscuit style ruthless calculus,
2874080	2878880	right? Where I could look at my views. I could look at my subs. I can see they're
2878880	2882720	both slowly growing over time. Could be faster if I worked harder, but that's on me,
2882720	2888080	but they're not going down. And it's like, you know what? Even as people unsub from me
2888080	2891520	and they're saying, I'm done, I'm done, I'm done. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm done.
2891520	2897600	Even as those people go, I mean, they are, they are in, in the total biscuit sense being replaced
2897600	2902640	because more numbers are coming in than are going out. So I'm in no danger, but nonetheless,
2903200	2906880	I don't want to make that argument because it kind of sounds like too, too calculating.
2906880	2910960	I simply want to say, I'm going to make what I want. I'm going to say what I want.
2912800	2920160	And, and this shit just pisses me off. Like, what do you expect to say here?
2921600	2923920	What, what exactly do you expect to influence by saying this?
2924000	2928960	Think about it. Like, should I beg and be like, come back, dude? No,
2928960	2932000	I'll change. I'll do whatever you want. No, no, I fucking won't.
2939280	2945920	Hold on. I want to see super chats here real quick. If you talk about the trucker video,
2945920	2951680	does it add a day? No, no, no. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
2951680	2956160	video. Does it add a day? No, no, no. It's that's honestly, mostly it's mostly just a troll, man.
2956160	2960320	I'm just fucking around. I'm Holsteiner. $5. If you'll finish the flaws of liberalism,
2960320	2962720	excellent work and a great job at the end. Thank you. I don't think they're going to watch it
2962720	2965440	though. I don't think James Lindsay or Helen Pluckrose even know who I am.
2966560	2972160	Even though it's for them. But yeah, like this one here, this is the first channel I
2972160	2976480	unsubscribe to. I don't like Trump per se, but this is a step too far. The arrogance.
2977280	2984320	It's like, okay, go away then. Fine. Fine. You know what? This is actually, I think the worst
2984320	2990720	one. I think this is the worst one. This guy's like quit shilling your shitty gaming channel.
2990720	2996080	Less than 1% of the channel subscribers bother to give a shit. I just tell them fuck off and
2996080	3000720	stop watching me. That's how I feel about it. All right. Because you know what? I like doing
3000720	3004960	my gaming channel. The gaming channel gets 50 viewers compared to like the 500 we have right
3004960	3009200	now. But I prefer it, you know? Okay, hold on. That's the wrong word. I don't prefer it. I like
3009200	3013760	both projects, but I like, I give them equal weight because I have, I have equal enjoyment
3013760	3019680	with both of them is what I mean. So people who are like, stop shilling the gaming. Fuck you
3019680	3023280	get out back. You know what? Here, here, hold on. Let's go to this guy.
3024080	3030320	I just, let's just kick him off the channel. Fuck him. I don't care. Fuck him. I'm, I'm done with
3030320	3036400	people who think that they can, they can continue to control what I do with my channel or my time
3038000	3042400	by saying, stop doing this. I'm on subbing. You need to say, you need to do, you need to say,
3042400	3048400	fuck you get out. If I want to completely convert this channel into a 100% gaming channel with
3048400	3056480	nothing but let's plays and completely destroy everything. That's that's my prerogative.
3056480	3066480	All right. I'm not going to be told what the fuck to do with my own platform by anyone.
3076400	3081040	Simple as that. And by the way, you guys should watch the gaming channel or else.
3087280	3093920	I enjoy being successful. I enjoy the donations and the viewers, but I would rather do something
3093920	3099360	that I truly enjoy with no viewers and no donations than to do something that I hate,
3099360	3103840	but to have viewers and donations. Does that make sense? Does that make sense?
3109120	3110080	That's how I feel about it.
3110080	3115680	That's how I feel about it. And I think I'm just,
3118480	3126000	I've reached the limit of dev being a nice inclusive, you know, everyone should have their
3126000	3130320	say. Everyone should have their take. I'm going to completely respect everyone's free speech,
3130320	3135600	even as you shit on me and try to destroy what I'm building. I think I'm past that point.
3136560	3137680	I think I'm past that point.
3142560	3147440	I think I'm past the people who want to somehow like shame me or steer me
3147440	3150080	or demand that I do something for them. I think I'm past that.
3150720	3152160	I don't want those people around anymore.
3152160	3166320	Oh, $5 for Holts. Instead of stop doing Paul and just focus on gaming or I'm leaving.
3169040	3173040	Here's the thing. Zam is my values haven't changed, but like
3174800	3178720	my experiences have definitely taught me a few things.
3178720	3187760	You know, I ran the discord for since like 2015 as a complete free speech zone.
3187760	3191600	I did not moderate it. I let people do whatever the fuck they want.
3192560	3195920	And for a while it was actually really fun because everyone was chill.
3196800	3203760	But eventually it got to a point where complete fucking retards showed up and ruined it because
3204640	3208000	in like a pure free speech zone where everyone's being chill,
3208000	3212000	if one person steps out of line, the community says, Hey, what the fuck's wrong with you?
3212000	3214800	Like, stop. Right. And if they're a good person, they'll generally stop.
3214800	3218720	You know, sometimes they'll sometimes they'll get blocked by some people if they don't stop.
3218720	3223920	And eventually they learn. Right. But once you start to include people in that community
3223920	3231120	who don't care about social pressure and don't care if they get blocked, then they start to
3231120	3234000	and they're just like, I'm just going to keep being like a shitty fucking person.
3234000	3238000	And they do that. And then they start to build up. Right. And they start to invite their friends.
3238000	3243120	And now you have a group of people who are in the server, who are in the community.
3244960	3250880	You know, I know, I know, Daddy, I know other people moderated it. Yes, I know. I know.
3250880	3255760	I understand. But but the rules that I had you guys moderate by were very lax.
3255760	3259440	You know what I mean? They were very lax rules, like say what you want,
3259440	3265520	do whatever you want, have fun. But like enough people joined the discord that were just
3266080	3271920	shitty people who did not care about being socially shamed and who did not fit in with
3271920	3277440	the actual vibe of the server. They ended up creating their own terrible spaces. And what
3277440	3283200	they would do in those spaces is they would raid other servers. They would raid other people in the
3283200	3288080	server. All right. They would bully people out of the server by chasing them around to the various
3288080	3292800	different rooms. A whole bunch of things started happening. And it's because without any sort of
3292800	3298880	moderation, I let the terrible element just grow and grow and grow under the guise of inclusivity
3298880	3302720	and saying like, okay, we all have free speech. We're all welcome here. We can all have these
3302720	3311520	debates. But then they took that that good nature that I provided. And they basically ruined it
3311520	3318800	with their bad behavior. So that's why that what's wrong with that. What's wrong with that
3318800	3324880	is that all the people, all the shitty people came in and started abusing the other fucking people
3324880	3329680	in the server. And then it got to a point where they were inviting people who weren't even like
3329680	3333440	viewers of mine. They just knew. They just knew that like, this is a server that was
3333440	3339200	unmoderated and they could fuck around in it. And I think it was like 2021. I started purging people
3339200	3342720	and people were like screaming, you can't do this. You can't do this to us. You're a free
3342720	3346720	speech guy. And I started purging people. And they're like, I never liked you. Anyway. I didn't
3346720	3349440	even, I don't even know who the fuck you are. I'm just here to fuck around. It's like, get the fuck
3349440	3354480	out. Right. So basically I got, I got to a point. I got to a point where I was like, you know what?
3358640	3367840	The, the rights of liberalism can be used to destroy themselves if wielded by bad actors,
3367840	3372400	by evil people or by complete fucking retards. And that's why you see some memes. It's like,
3372400	3377360	listen, liberal, liberal rights for people who have more than 120 IQ. It's like, you know what?
3377360	3382800	Maybe that's actually the fucking me. That's how it should be. You know? Yeah, it is. I gave them
3382800	3392160	an inch. It took a mile. Yeah. So you know what? You're going to be a new discord server.
3393440	3397200	It will be open to the right now. It's only open to donators. There is a new discord server.
3397200	3401600	It is only open to donators. It will eventually be open to everyone down the road sometime,
3403040	3405040	but this will not be a server that I allow to go to shit.
3406720	3412240	And all the fucking retards and glowies people who are calling for actual violence, people who
3412240	3416160	are actually bullying people, people who are actually breaking rules, and then crying free
3416160	3421440	speech about it later. None of them will be spared the wrath of dev.
3436320	3438560	You're good. Then you don't get the fuck out. I don't care.
3438640	3447040	If you don't like the new authoritarian dev arc, then you know what? You can leave. Or you know
3447040	3451040	what? If you don't like it, you'll probably end up doing something that'll have me ban you. So
3451840	3458640	pick your poison. You can leave, you can get banned, or you can fall in line. I don't care
3458640	3467440	anymore. And no, it doesn't mean that I'm banning critiques or criticisms of me. I'm not banning
3467440	3477520	that shit. I'm banning people who, who are just fucking evil and terrible and who hide it through
3477520	3481200	like a thin veneer of critique when there's not actually any critique there. They just want to
3481200	3484640	shit on somebody or people who don't even have the veneer who are just bad. I'm just getting
3484640	3499360	rid of them. Yeah. And cooking and fitness streams to add cooking and fitness streams
3499360	3502400	to the sub or I'll move. We'll listen to get into Terry Carter's musical threat.
3502400	3507920	Also how to get on the new server on the old server. If you're in the donator channels,
3507920	3511600	there's pinned links to get on the new server. So if any of you have donated,
3512480	3517280	you may come over to the new server. It's already there. It's already available. Yeah.
3520160	3525440	Plato said this in his criticism of democracy. Yes. Democracy, but retards ruin it.
3530640	3533440	Here's what's in here. $5. I've got two dates, two different poly people this week.
3533440	3538960	Wish me luck. Oh no, dude, dude. Not the Paulies. Not the Paulies.
3538960	3542720	Skeptical wave says, Devin, you consider these people newly exist due to the decline.
3543280	3548960	Listen, skeptical waves. I hate to break it to you, buddy, because I know where your politics go,
3549760	3555440	but the vast majority of people who I'm describing, they're more right wingers than left wingers.
3556240	3560240	There are definitely left wingers like this that I'm describing, but none of them would ever be
3560240	3564560	caught dead in my server. They're all watching vosh and they all think I'm a fascist. All right.
3565200	3567200	The ones who were in my server are right wingers.
3571280	3576880	And these are people who are like screaming about like wanting to do legitimate violence
3576880	3582000	in real life. These are people who are screaming about how they just hate all trans people or all
3582000	3587760	gay people or all black people. Sometimes they're screaming about like how they want to just bully
3587760	3590880	everyone else out of the server. They have been bullying people out of the server. Like there's,
3591760	3597600	there's a room where there's specifically meant no arguing. All right. No arguing in this room.
3597600	3602400	This is, this is a room to vent about your daily life and your troubles and how things might seem
3602400	3606880	home hopeless. It's like the, it is the, we're all going to make it bro's room. All right.
3606880	3611920	And some of these people would monitor that room and then bully the people who posted in there.
3612880	3616240	And I am just not going to tolerate that anymore.
3621040	3626480	Nothing. I'm a super chat. Oh, $5. Thank you. We have freedom to achieve our best,
3626480	3631360	not to mess everything's not to mess things up for everyone. Yes, exactly. Right. Exactly. So
3632960	3644960	another liberal value is is not just free speech, but also free association.
3645440	3648320	Okay.
3652720	3654960	Yeah. Yeah, exactly. That's what it is. Yeah.
3656640	3661600	Free association is another liberal value. And that's the one I'm going to be leaning on more
3663600	3667840	because I'm just tired of tolerating people who are fucking terrible. And frankly,
3667840	3671600	who I look down on and I really don't like and who I think actually make my community
3671680	3677040	when I'm trying to build worse. So they're going, they're all going to go. So by the way,
3677040	3682320	if you are a donator and you are in the old server, the old, the old server will eventually
3682320	3689760	be nuked. So make sure to get yourself in the new server. Okay. A tricky Mario for $5. Thank you.
3689760	3692320	Articles, please. Otherwise Carlos will punish you with constantly in puns.
3693280	3702080	A devs M bison arc for $5. Thanks. Jiggy calzone. I just wonder why waste your life. Hate watching
3702080	3705040	funny that it's more common on the right. Left is trying to cancel out of distance.
3706480	3710720	I have noticed that. Yeah. I think there's a lot of right-wingers who believed that I was
3710720	3716000	a right winger because I critiqued the left. I'm not a right winger. I'm not a right winger. So
3722320	3725840	good to have to try to avoid too much screen time. I already do, man. I do actually go offline
3725840	3730560	quite a bit now. I don't think I missed any super chess. I'm scrolling back up. I don't
3730560	3737440	miss any super chats. Oh, here we go. I did find one. Sorry. Well, isn't thanks for the $5 dev.
3737440	3742640	Stop doing gaming and just do politics or else I'll take lives and devs walls sublease and play
3742640	3751200	sabaton and weird Al in the evening hours. Oh, I see. Okay. I was old as time. Yep. Yep. Thank you.
3752320	3759840	Thanks for all the super chats, guys. I do appreciate it. I do appreciate it.
3763360	3769760	So, yeah, anyway, I do have some plans with upcoming months that will be that partially
3769760	3774240	dependent if I get this Vyvanse thing worked out, but we'll see. Right. And the plans do involve
3775760	3781120	getting the weekly sip to episode 200 and then maybe at episode 200 and changing up how I do
3781120	3786720	some things about how I stream. I want to I want to do more streams. All right. I want to be live
3786720	3791680	more often. I don't want to do and I don't mean I don't mean the gaming stuff. The gaming stuff
3791680	3796720	is the gaming stuff is like a fun bonus at the end of the day, right? I want to be live more often
3797440	3803520	during the day, doing like research streams or politics streams, talking to people,
3803520	3807840	maybe reading some books or reading, reading court documents, reading papers, you know,
3808480	3818000	I want to do more of that stuff. So I think at some point after weekly sip 200,
3818720	3823760	I'm going to probably end the weekly sip, maybe not end it, but turn it into like a segment of
3823760	3830000	a larger stream and change things up about how I do streaming. I do want to be I do want to do
3830800	3837920	more streams. At the same time, I don't want to give up doing the gaming streams because the
3837920	3842960	gaming streams I find I find a lot of fun. You know, I like it when when Dave and I hop on the
3842960	3847680	couch and we play a video game, you know, and most of you guys don't watch that. I'd like it if you
3847680	3850880	did. But I understand that most of you won't because you're here for politics, not for gaming.
3850880	3854960	But nonetheless, like I said earlier, I want to do it. I enjoy it. It is a great way for me to
3854960	3858960	unwind at the end of the day, or playing some Mario or playing some whatever the fuck the game
3858960	3867680	is. And I just I like it. So no, I'd appreciate if you support that. That'd be nice. But I do,
3867680	3871600	but I'm not going to get just because I'm doing other streams or I want to do other streams
3871600	3876320	doesn't mean that I want to give up the game, the gaming stuff at night. All right. And then like,
3877120	3881920	more streams, which can probably be cut down into stream segments. So basically following the
3881920	3887680	Twitch poll model of doing some streams. And I'll probably upload the stream segments to like,
3887680	3892560	the Devin friends channel. Actually, yeah, that's another one. There was a guy on the deck. Okay,
3892560	3899360	I fucking show you this. Hold on. There's Devin friends, which is where I upload, like my talks
3899360	3903520	with people. Like I do debates with people. I talked to Brianna Wu, I talked to whoever it
3903520	3909520	goes on Devin friends, right? And can I fucking find this? No, it's gone. I think it's gone.
3910160	3913200	Is it maybe it's this one? Hold on. I'm gonna look for it.
3918240	3923840	Like here, I'll show you another example. Okay. This guy, I am now sufficiently sick of seeing
3923840	3928720	notifications from this channel for ancient videos that I have unsubscribed. I just said good,
3928720	3936240	like get the fuck out. All right. Devin friends is meant to be an archive of streams. And it's
3936240	3940000	going to be an archive of stream segments in the future. This is what the channel is for.
3940720	3944560	All right. Fuck, I hate people who do that shit.
3949280	3955040	They've gotten one guy people not even the stream. Yeah, kind of. I watched the gaming stream.
3955920	3959920	Seeing Dave and Naomi call you retard constantly is fun.
3959920	3969040	You have highlights? Yeah. Basically, the Devin friends channel is going to become like
3969040	3975040	a stream highlights channel. I'll probably move a whole bunch of of old streams over there.
3976400	3980640	Or maybe I'll leave like, I'll leave some here. I don't know. I don't know how I'm going to
3980640	3984320	organize it. But basically Devin friends will become stream highlights channel
3984320	3985680	once I start doing more streams.
3989920	3996800	So more streams is a plan. If the gaming stuff ever happens to take off, or at least
3996800	4000720	slowly grow, that would also be nice because continuing that and expanding that is also
4000720	4006320	the plan. Maybe we're finding some of that. Both of these kind of are predicated on me
4006320	4011520	losing weight though, because I'm like, I understand the appeal of Hassan, he's in good
4011520	4016880	shape, which is why lots of people watch him. Like I'm, if you ever see me on the fucking gaming
4016880	4023920	channel, I'm a fat blob. I see, I watch you for your sips and whatever commentary videos
4023920	4027120	you upload. I care very little for the video game streams, TBH. And see, here's the thing,
4027120	4032800	like, like Val Medic, that's, that's your business, right? That is your business, Val Medic.
4036160	4038960	But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop doing them. You know what I mean? Like,
4038960	4042800	you don't have to watch what I'm putting out, but I'm not going to stop putting out things
4042800	4046400	that you're not interested in because I still enjoy them. That's what I mean. All right.
4046480	4050320	And also, yeah, I know, I know daddy editor's coming.
4051280	4055280	Yes, that's happening. That's happening, daddy. That's coming in the next month or two.
4059200	4064480	Um, hold on. Let me try to find to the example.
4068240	4073200	Don't ruin your brand. I don't care about my brand. Come on, come on. You fucking,
4073440	4076560	my NAS is going slow. Just, you know, one guy emote.
4077600	4079920	I think there already is like a one guy emote on seven TV.
4083280	4086880	Okay. Yeah. So Dave and I played through lies of P right.
4091440	4095120	I also want to interact with the community more. Yes. I do want to do
4095120	4097760	more like Collins or whatever with the community. Yes.
4098720	4104800	Okay. Hold on. I'm here. Okay. Just wait.
4108560	4115280	Yeah. So here I'll, I'll, I'll, this is like, uh, a VOD of one of the gaming streams here.
4116720	4121840	This is lies of P like I'm fat. All right. I look quite fat.
4122400	4126560	Now Dave looks skinnier than me, but his slouching doesn't help because he like,
4126560	4131760	he's like a giga sloucher. He's actually taller than me, but I look much bigger than him
4131760	4135520	because I'm really fat. I'm also more muscular than him by a lot. Like I have a lot of muscle
4135520	4140640	too, but I'm also really fat and he's just like a sloucher. He's like a, he has like tiny arms,
4140640	4146320	like really like thin wrists, thin legs, and he's a tall guy and he slouches. So like,
4147040	4155440	and also I'm just fat before I can do any sort of professional streaming that has my face on it.
4155440	4160240	I got to lose some fucking weight guys. Like that's just the truth. All right.
4165200	4166080	That's just how it is.
4169280	4170560	I still have the flash shirt. Yeah.
4170560	4181120	One of my dad calls you fat. So, so like I got, I got before I can actually do any of this
4182000	4186640	sort of, um, slouch mask, maxing posture, Chad,
4189600	4194000	and go do as losing a hundred pounds. I'd like to, you know what I mean? Like, I think before
4194000	4198400	I can do any sort of streaming with my face on it, like that's, that's more serious than just
4198400	4205360	me being on a couch with Dave. I got to lose weight, got to lose weight because I don't think
4206080	4210000	if I put my face on this stream instead of this artwork, I don't think the stream is going fucking
4210000	4222960	anywhere. Um, go V tuber, make a V tube avatar PC. Thank you for the five gifted memberships,
4222960	4229360	dude. Thank you. Thank you. It flatter cats for $5. Is there a list of games you plan to stream?
4229360	4233200	Because most of them don't really interest me, but I'd watch, uh, for example, crosscode stream.
4234240	4239280	I mean, I want to play crosscode it's it is on the list, but like we're finishing up sea of stars
4239280	4243440	and I'm probably going to give like, you know, retro new games, a short break before I start
4243440	4249520	the next one. I don't see the game list is like never ending and always growing. You know what
4249520	4260960	I mean? So yeah, that's kind of the point that I'm getting across here is like my stream plans
4260960	4268000	for both the gaming channel and for this channel, I think just require me to lose weight before it
4268000	4272640	will ever take off because I think, I think I'm, I think at some level I'm just too gross to watch.
4273520	4274880	You know what I mean? Um,
4279600	4283760	I guess obviously, of course, for, of course, for my own health too. Yes. Jiggy. I agree with you
4283760	4291200	on that. Yeah. Um, beyond that, I mentioned earlier dividing up my content into different
4291200	4296800	types of shows because, but I need, I need different artwork and I need, um, I need,
4296800	4302720	I need different artwork and I need also, I need to figure out how I want to divide it.
4302720	4308240	Basically I have plans, but they're good. They're going to take a little bit of time to set in stone.
4308240	4312000	And honestly, even just having that one good week on Vy Vance kind of showed me what I was
4312000	4317680	capable of doing. You know what I mean? Because on that one week, man, I got so much stuff done
4317680	4324560	before the, before I up the dose, I got so much good work done so I can do it. I just got to deal
4324560	4333360	with this stuff. I love the current video background with you smiling and all the evil
4333360	4338880	words cycling. It's amazing. I don't know. I feel like I got to update it or something.
4342080	4348800	I think, I don't know. I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out. No new artwork to lose your first
4348800	4354800	10 pounds, maybe. Well, a lot of the new art assets are already coming in. Like the gaming
4354800	4359840	stream already has new, new art assets. And I'd say about half the new art assets for SFO already
4359840	4366320	in as well. But yeah, that's, that's the plan that I've just outlined. I just outlined my plan for
4366320	4372160	the next few months, more streams, research streams. I'm going to try to basically get the,
4372160	4376640	get the stream stuff locked down for both gaming and non-gaming content. And then try to try to
4376640	4381840	organize the, the video essays because I would love it if like Dev and Friends were a stream
4381840	4388640	segments channel for the streams that I do. SFO still posted like my scripted takes
4388640	4398000	because my scripted takes are, my scripted takes are, they take more time to kind of put together,
4398000	4407600	but it's still doable. And then like anything, anything else is just like kind of fun stuff.
4407600	4411760	Like the DevKit channel is fun. No one really watches it, but it's where I just do my vlogs.
4411760	4415280	I just kind of hang out there. It's like, Oh, I feel like talking about this thing today. So I'll
4415280	4419040	do a vlog about it. Or I'll talk about a movie or I'll talk about like a piece of technology
4419040	4423600	I've just tinkered with. Like the DevKit channel is like my personal like channel just for me.
4423600	4429680	You know what I mean? The TF2, dude, the TF2 servers up on the new server.
4430880	4437760	Listen, new discord server has Minecraft has TF2. Things are okay.
4441440	4444240	Yeah. The evil words meme is getting old in the background. Lots of people,
4444240	4445760	lots of people don't get it. Yeah.
4445760	4454000	Anyway, I'm just rambling and repeating myself at this point.
4455280	4462400	So never heard of your personal blog. Yeah. Yeah. My personal blog, my personal vlog
4462400	4472880	channel is called the DevKit. Yeah. The DevKit is what it's called. And yes,
4472880	4476960	sent in. Hi, the new server. The new discord server is linked in the donation,
4478160	4482400	the donation room of the old server. So get yourself in the clay castle. Hey, man, it's
4482400	4488640	been a while here. I'm going to grab some water. Listen, I've now just been talking about like
4488640	4493840	personal stuff. And like my health and my feelings and my plans for like an hour and a half at this
4493840	4497840	fucking point. So I'm sorry, it's been so long. But you know what, do you guys want to talk about
4497840	4514240	articles now? You guys want to talk about articles now? Here. I do buy old games and
4514240	4520480	consoles. I also mod them. It's just like a fun side project for me. Here. I'm gonna grab some
4520480	4526320	water. And I'll be back in a second. Okay. It's me a second. All right. Hold on.
4531040	4543120	Also, the new chair is doing very well.
4550480	4572080	Listen, listen, my long term goal after I move and I have the studio built
4572880	4578080	is that like, maybe maybe just me on my own. Maybe me and a co host will do a show called
4578240	4584240	the daily sip instead of the weekly sip. And what we'll do is I'll just like, I'll stream for like
4584240	4589920	four or five hours and I'll cover articles or news or just research things. And I'll do that
4589920	4605120	like five times a week, something like that. Hold on. Some of the chat says everyone with
4605120	4609200	their weight loss advice. SFO doesn't want to lose weight. That's why he's trying to
4609200	4614320	hype himself to do it. People get fat for nothing. No, some guy on the internet. That's not how it
4614320	4624160	is. I do want to get I do want to actually lose weight. It's just I don't have the time to devote
4624160	4630880	to like an hour long workout every day or something. Unfortunately. Bring back the porn
4630880	4640960	star. Bring back Lilith. Okay, sure. Three dollars. Hey, Dev, for losing weight, I recommend
4640960	4644160	no commitment gym membership like plant fitness. So just make hundreds of equipment. I make it
4644160	4648320	tear it up. I just got a couple of months of dues to make $25 a month. Listen, here's the thing.
4648320	4652560	I've been in shape before. I've been fat and then lost all the weight before. So I know exactly how
4652560	4659360	to do it. I appreciate all the advice, but I know what to do it. I just got to find the time,
4659360	4664880	you know, I think like this desk, you guys have probably heard my desk slowly collapsing over
4664880	4670080	the years. I'm going to buy a new desk when I move. And then once I move, I'm going to have
4670080	4676640	probably a standing desk that like goes up and down. And one of those one of those things where
4676640	4689840	I can walk in place while I do my work. I love that average American class tweet you made a
4689840	4694160	month ago with a picture of Miss Frizzles class. It made me smile. It was funny because people are
4694160	4699280	saying this is an average American class in 2024. Look at how there's no white people in it. There's
4699280	4702880	like a bunch of black kids and like some white kids and there's like some like Indian kids or
4702880	4706400	Chinese, whatever. Right. And I'm just, I just posted a picture of Miss Frizzles class.
4709120	4715360	Like people are losing it, dude. It's like, why are there so many black people in America?
4715360	4720320	I mean, there have been for a long time, dude, is there anything new fucking weirdos?
4720320	4732000	Did you post those graphs in the economy? Ironically,
4732000	4735440	the information on them and your claims and what they say don't line up. Yes, they do.
4738560	4739600	Hold on. I'll pull them up again.
4744080	4747520	They absolutely do. Give me a second.
4750320	4757520	Hold on.
4760480	4761280	Okay. Where is it?
4763520	4764020	Okay.
4769840	4774960	I'm pulling them all up. Hold on. I did three tweets that were kind of similar.
4774960	4786240	Three or four, actually. Okay. Yeah. Here we go. Here we go. Okay. So
4794480	4801120	here we go. Okay. So I'm going to, this is me making fun of all the fucking
4801840	4806960	dissident right weirdos who are, who are talking about this civilization is collapsing.
4806960	4811520	Everything is crumbling around you. Keep watching those, those TikToks of blacks,
4811520	4816400	kicking the shit out of whites. Let it completely color your perception of the real world that you
4816400	4821920	barely interact with. Take the black pill through my sponsored link. And I posted it with the violent
4821920	4827120	crime rate in the United States. Just going the fuck down over the course of the nineties.
4828000	4831680	It's mostly leftoids who complain about Biden's violent crime bill.
4831680	4836800	Some rightoids complain about it too, but mostly leftoids, but you know what? It fucking worked
4839200	4844880	like, Oh shit. The Democrats passed a bill in the 1990s that massively curtailed crime.
4846320	4847840	That sounds pretty fucking good to me.
4847840	4857120	But yeah, like violent crime going down. It's a pretty good trend right there.
4861120	4871280	The second one that I posted, people are saying, like, yeah, you sound like a muscovite during the
4871280	4876320	USSR being comfortable in the main province of the United States. You sound like a muscovite.
4876720	4881280	In the main province, while the rest live in squalor, I have traveled my fair share. And
4881280	4885360	all I see is countries being ruined by mass immigrants and treasonous governments. It's
4885360	4890800	like, okay, well, where's the ruin. Yeah. You've seen TikToks of druggies wandering around San
4890800	4894560	Francisco and said the whole world sucks, but in reality, things are actually getting better. So
4894560	4899520	like here, let's see. So this is violent crime. Same one going down. We've already seen this,
4899520	4910960	right? Here's this one. Real wages rise again as wage growth outpaces inflation. So real wages
4910960	4917360	are wages adjusted for inflation. So if inflation is going up, but real wages are going up higher,
4917360	4922800	you're actually making more money, even adjusted for inflation, right? So for example,
4923280	4931600	there was during the COVID bullshit from here to here, there was a lot of economic problems.
4931600	4936800	All right. Now you might say those economic problems, you know, they were a price we had
4936800	4941680	to pay to deal with the emergency. You might say that the price that we paid was way too high,
4941680	4946960	that it did not deserve that kind of response and that they ruined things. Either way, we're out of
4947760	4954240	that era now. We're past that. And now that things have actually begun to return to normal,
4954240	4960720	things are in fact improving again. All right. Consumer price index, average hourly earnings,
4960720	4967200	real average hour, and then the real average hourly earnings. So yes, real wages are once
4967200	4973520	again outpacing inflation. And then there's, what was this one here? Right. The poverty rate in the
4973600	4981440	United States. Yeah. So like poverty has gone like up and down. It was, it peaked at 15%
4982160	4989760	in like 93. It went down to like, what is that? 11 and a quarter, went up a bit, went down a bit.
4990480	4996080	And then it was the lowest in 2019. Then this little hump here seems to be the COVID hump
4997280	5001520	of poverty. I don't think it's going back up again, guys. People are like,
5001520	5005200	we're all living in squalor. Like, are you like, where the fuck are you? Like,
5006800	5014880	I mean, there's less people in poverty then after the fucking 2008 collapse, what do you mean?
5017440	5022800	And then there's this one where like this guy is saying that like, it's so hard for millennials
5022800	5029040	to buy a house. Now you look at this gen Z on track with older generations, homeownership
5029040	5035520	rates. So basically each one of these lines is what percentage of that generation owned a house
5035520	5040800	and at what age they owned a house at. So let's look at the baby boomers. That's like the brown
5040800	5049360	line that goes really far. So something like, what is this? 10, 15% of baby boomers owned a house at
5049360	5058880	age 15 or sorry, age 18. It's now something like, what is this? 60% or 70% of baby boomers owned a
5058880	5068400	house at 40. So that's the baby boomer line, it goes up. Look at gen X, same thing. 10, 15% own
5068400	5073840	a house at 18, at 40. It looks like just slightly less than the baby boomers, but pretty close.
5074160	5080160	Right? The millennial line. In fact, the millennial line actually started off a bit better
5080720	5087760	than the baby boomers and the gen Xers. At 18, a few more of them actually owned houses
5088400	5093360	and their line, like it dips a little bit below here, but it catches back up. So like millennials
5094560	5100080	at age 40 are pretty close to the other generations in terms of their house ownership rates.
5100080	5107040	Right. And then gen Z, gen Z started even higher and they're actually doing okay so far too.
5107600	5113840	Right. There's the line. So there's this perception of the economy as being completely
5113840	5120640	and utterly fucked beyond repair and everything's collapsing. Everything's terrible. There's rampant
5120640	5125760	violence in the streets. And I think a lot of this is honestly just pushed by social media because
5125760	5131520	you're scrolling all day, seeing viral sensationalist clips of like druggies wandering
5131520	5137840	around the streets of San Francisco in a haze, or you're seeing like these, like just like random
5137840	5142640	violence of people just fighting in the street. Right. And Oh, especially if you follow that one
5142640	5147760	guy who posts only black on white violence clips, if you follow him, you think there's a race war
5147760	5156240	going on. All right. But in actuality, things seem to be pretty much in line where they should be.
5156800	5162560	Right. Like it seems like millennials are owning homes that are at roughly the same rate
5162560	5165920	as previous generations. Crime seems to be going down.
5166720	5171280	The economy seems to have recovered. Like all the numbers that we can pull up and look at,
5171440	5178720	they don't show, the numbers don't correlate to what people are feeling. People are feeling,
5178720	5184720	people are feeling like in their guts that a collapse is coming, but the data doesn't show
5184720	5189600	the collapse. So there's two possible interpretations of what's going on here.
5190400	5195120	One interpretation is that there is no collapse and people are just fucking
5195120	5199920	schizoids because they spend too much time on the internet. That's possible. Another
5200720	5206640	interpretation is that there is actually a collapse, but it's somewhere that our data
5206640	5210960	can't see. And we have, and like, for some reason, it's like a collapse coming in from
5210960	5216400	a novel direction that we're not studying, or we don't understand and people's intuition can
5216400	5220880	pick up on it, but we just don't know how to, how to capture it and understand it in any sort
5221760	5231280	of reasonable way. All right. So it could be, it could be either of those situations.
5235360	5239600	Artemis Fowl says, this seems like an intellectual failure to understand data. How so Artemis,
5239600	5246800	how so? Or they're lying. Okay. Here's the thing. If you want to say that they're lying,
5247120	5251600	um, Avalon, you can say that, but now you have to, now you have to like prove a whole
5251600	5256000	bunch of other shit for me to accept that because these come from multiple institutions
5256560	5263200	that do not, they're not, they're not all the same power block. All right. If like different
5263200	5266800	governments and different universities and different institutions are all saying,
5266800	5271760	this is probably the case. You need to, you now need to show that they're all lying.
5276800	5290240	Let's see what else? Hold on. I'm still scrolling here. I mean, let me grab all the,
5291040	5296960	all the supers titanium for $5. I think doing the research stream is once a week
5296960	5299520	is a good start to start building the habits now. Possibly. Yes.
5299520	5303920	Um,
5307360	5311440	$10 from snartigan. Thank you. People want to feel like things are worse than they actually
5311440	5315920	are. So they can justify misery and learned helplessness. Internet induced mental illness
5315920	5322960	is the real crisis. Yes. Yes. I absolutely think that's the case. Start again. I think lots of
5322960	5330160	people, they fucking suck. All right. They're sad. They're sitting inside. They're scrolling
5330160	5334400	on their phones all day. They have nothing going for them. They can't get a fucking girlfriend.
5334400	5338960	They can't hold down a fucking job. Their life sucks. They're like 35 living with their parents.
5339520	5345440	And they're just like, this is someone's fault. It's gotta be if they're, if they're leftist,
5345440	5349600	they'll say the bourgeoisie. If they're rightists, they'll say the globalist elite,
5349600	5354400	but they're saying basically the same thing. It's gotta be the man keeping me down. It's like, no.
5354400	5360000	All right. Like just deal with it yourself or deal with, deal with it yourself.
5362320	5365280	Like maybe you should solve your own fucking problems before you start
5365280	5367760	talking about how the entire world's out to get you.
5367760	5379200	Artemus Fowl, $5. That graph really means nothing to have real wages increasing 0.5%
5379200	5383600	after falling 23% doesn't leave people in a better position than when they started.
5383600	5389520	Yes. Okay. So I understand this point of view. The issue is that you can't really go back, right?
5390400	5395120	So for example, when people talk about, I know this is not what you're saying,
5395120	5398640	Artemus. I'm just using this as an example. Okay. People talk about inflation, right?
5398640	5404320	Inflation was 8% during, during COVID lockdowns. And now inflation is back down to 2%.
5405120	5408240	And it's like, well, there you go. Inflation has decreased, but people are saying,
5408880	5413920	dude, dude, but the prices are still high. It's like, you can't go back. You can't go through
5413920	5420880	a deflationary period of negative 8%. All right. Cause like inflation would fucking,
5420880	5425760	they fucking sucks, but so does deflation. All right. You can't actually have the prices go back
5427120	5434560	because basically both inflation and deflation cause their own economic problems.
5435440	5440160	And it's better to not move at all. All right. It's better to have, to have your, your dollar
5440160	5446800	relatively, relatively fixed and set and things are good. But if you go through an inflationary
5446800	5452880	period, it would cause more damage to then go through a deflationary period
5452880	5457600	to get back to where you were. It's actually better to stop and stay where you are.
5460640	5462720	Yeah. Inflation is a rate of change. Yes.
5465680	5468720	This guy who just chatted is what I'm talking about. He says, wait, wait, wait. Inflation
5468720	5478960	does not go down. Yes, it does because inflation isn't the price. Inflation is the rate of change
5478960	5484880	of the price over time. Right? So if something costs a dollar and then you go through some
5484880	5493520	inflation and now it costs $2 and then it stays at $2 for like 10 years, what that means is inflation
5493520	5507200	has stopped. Yes. But anyway, talk about what I was saying. Yeah. Like it does suck that we
5507200	5512720	went through this, this period of contraction because of COVID and you can argue whether or
5512720	5517040	not that was necessary. That's a different conversation, but it happened. And now we're on
5517040	5522320	the, we're now on the upswing again and starting to recover. If your argument is that we haven't
5522320	5528960	recovered everything we've lost during COVID yet. That's true, but we will. I'm actually quite
5528960	5535840	confident that we will give it enough time. I have read plus sized alpha manga. Yes, I have.
5536720	5543840	I like it. It's funny. I'm not claiming we had deflation. I'm claiming that we shouldn't have
5543840	5547680	it. And that people who want prices to go back down to what they were before are they, they want
5547680	5554160	it. Um, tricky Mario for $5. Thank you. I'm a game show fan too. And I've seen plenty of
5554160	5558560	black contestants in the seventies and eighties game shows on other minorities. Yeah. Like
5560480	5566000	you can't say this about Europe, but America has actually always been a multi-ethnic nation
5566000	5571040	since its founding in this idea of we want it to be a white nation, like fucking stupid.
5572000	5580880	Uh, what else? Let's see here. What's the other super chats. Let's take a look at them.
5582560	5585760	$5 from wonderful galaxy inflation rule 34.
5588880	5595760	Thanks dude. Anonymous coward for $5. It could be a recession in an industry specific areas.
5595760	5599920	Tech is a bloodbath right now with mass layoffs and high supply of workers on and offshore.
5599920	5603680	Oh yeah. There's definitely that too, right? Like we've been seeing like all those tech companies,
5603680	5609920	just like shedding people like Twitch is shedding people and Amazon and, and what was it like
5609920	5614880	LinkedIn just fired some people like a lots of tech jobs are going away right now. But honestly,
5614880	5619600	a lot of them are useless jobs. A lot of them are just like the, that fucking Instagram girl
5619600	5623760	who does nothing all day, right? A lot of them are just useless, shitty jobs. And it's probably
5623760	5629360	better that they go. He sent me a stream labs. Let me go take a look at it. Artemis.
5629920	5632400	Thank you as always. Artemis. Thanks.
5643680	5649120	I'll load it in. Hold on. $5 from Tara. Shevanko proposition. You get 8% deflation,
5649120	5653120	but your 401k crashes 50%. Was it worth it? Probably not.
5653680	5656880	Um, dr. Diddler to to horror. Stop talking about your sick inflation.
5660640	5665120	$5 and living does walls. I live with a fat Canadian gamer has goat ridden man server
5665120	5671120	and his genocidal child bride. This is clearly society's fault. Billions must need $5.
5672320	5677360	Starting in every time shoe says line go up world more good or I feel like ceiling. Yes,
5677360	5682240	growth is good. See people. When people do the line go up meme, they're generally talking about
5682240	5687760	like GDP, which is not good. Like GDP doesn't matter because GDP is like, you can have a
5687760	5692960	suffering population and GDP can go up. Right. So GDP is not, is not the line you should look at.
5692960	5698080	There are other lines, but those lines are going up too. All right. Like child mortality going
5698080	5703920	down, you know, worldwide poverty going down poverty in our country is going down. All right.
5703920	5708960	Violent crime going down, war going down. All right. So many things are actually better than
5708960	5716080	they were just, and yeah, it's, it's slow. There are setbacks. Sometimes there are setbacks that
5716080	5721520	take hold that like that, that, that last whole generations, but things are actually getting
5721520	5731440	better. Okay. Like calm down and fucking doomers. Things are okay. Wonderful galaxy, $5. I'm stupid.
5731440	5740480	Why is deflation bad? So deflation is bad. Deflation is bad because it incentivizes you
5740480	5745120	not to spend your money. Right. So for example, let's say that you have a hundred dollars
5745680	5752160	and with a hundred dollars, you want to buy. Oh, fuck. You know, here, hold, let's say you have
5752160	5759200	a thousand dollars with a thousand dollars. You want to buy a TV. Okay. And you're like,
5759200	5762640	I'll buy the TV. But if you're in a deflationary period, it's like, dude,
5764080	5768960	the TV is price will drop by like a hundred dollars in six months because of deflation,
5768960	5774000	because, because prices are going down because money's worth more, you know, as, as inflation
5774000	5780160	goes up, money's worth less as deflation goes up, money's worth more. So it's like, I shouldn't
5780160	5786400	spend my money right now because I can get that the same thing for less money in six months.
5786400	5790640	So I'll just hold on, hold on my money. Right. And so everyone holds onto their money.
5790640	5794480	And now you're in a situation where like, if deflation is high enough,
5795200	5798880	it completely disincentivizes any form of spending. So it's like,
5798880	5803840	you know, I, I have, I have these, these business needs, right. I got to replenish my tools,
5803840	5808080	replenish my whatever, but you know what, those tools and materials and supplies,
5808080	5811600	they'll all be a lot cheaper in six months. So I'll just push through and just
5812400	5817200	make do with it. All right. And then what you have is if you're going through deflation,
5817200	5822080	what you have is people are now buying less things, which means that the, the,
5822080	5826000	the producers of those things, they don't have to produce as much. Right. It's like, well,
5826000	5830160	shit, no one's buying our products. You know, no one's buying the TVs we're making. Fuck. I
5830160	5834720	guess we've got to, we've got to produce less TVs, which means less income for them, which means you
5834720	5837760	got to lay people off because now people there's not enough work for people because you're not
5837760	5845200	making as much stuff. Right. And so you can actually enter into a deflation spiral where
5845200	5851440	your economy completely stagnates. No one's making anything anymore. No one's buying anything anymore.
5851440	5859920	And no one has any jobs. Right. So deflation has its own set of bad things. If that goes too high,
5859920	5864800	just like how with inflation, you have, if you have runaway inflation, now your money's worth
5864800	5868560	nothing. Everything's like the prices and everything are sky high. You can't afford
5868560	5875440	anything anymore. Like both, both inflation and deflation have their own problems.
5882000	5883280	Okay. What else? What's next?
5886960	5892160	Artemis $10. Let's see. CPI is a highly manipulated figure and has almost zero
5892160	5896640	transparency. How it factors its values doesn't account for a shrink inflation that is obviously
5896640	5901760	happening. Don't put faith in graphs that mean nothing. At the very least, you will have to
5901760	5906080	provide me with something else to counter at Artemis, but thank you for the $10. I do appreciate
5906080	5914480	it. $5 deflation. Isn't bad. No, it is lower gas prices, increase the economic growth of a nation
5914480	5920880	inflation and deflation are natural and happen all the time. Yes, they're okay. Something being
5920880	5925600	natural doesn't make it good. That's a dumb argument. All right. Inflation and deflation
5925600	5929680	do happen all the time, but there's negative effects to too much inflation and there's
5929680	5936400	negative effects to too much deflation. All right. The gold standard is fucking retarded.
5937120	5938960	Jesus gold fucking standard. Okay.
5946000	5949920	There we go. Yeah. The deflationary spiral.
5952640	5958880	The great depression was regarded by some as a deflationary spiral. Oh, wow. Okay.
5961120	5965440	See, I wanted to look up an example of it, of a deflationary spiral because I knew Japan had one
5965520	5973200	at one point. I didn't think it'd be the great depression, but okay.
5975840	5977440	But no deflation can be bad. Yes.
5980400	5986480	Um, yeah, I'll, I'll grab your, your, uh, your other super chat Artemis. Give me a second here.
5989040	5995200	Cocaine is natural. So it's good for you. Thanks dude. Where's the fuck? Where's the
5995200	6014080	fucking Artemis for $5 says inflate these balls in your mouth. Fuck you.
6015440	6019600	Deb, you definitely have time to work out. I doubt you are doing anything when you first wake up
6019600	6034960	my dude. Um, I'm adding up all my time. A lot of my time is spent on putting together stuff
6034960	6044080	for articles or no, no, for videos, but it's not properly utilized primarily because of the ADHD
6044080	6051920	symptoms, which that one week on 10 milligrams of Vyvanse actually helped a lot. I think with
6051920	6056480	better organization, I'll be able to like cobble together extra time to do a lot of the things that
6056480	6066880	I want to do. But right now I'm a disorganized mess. I need to work on that first, but listen,
6066880	6070800	thanks. Thanks very much for everything.
6078400	6082880	Agarizer they're both bad, but let's only let them do the one that hurts the little guy
6082880	6087360	and makes mega property holders better off. Are you a communist? Are you complaining about the
6087360	6095280	Bourgeois Sean King $5. I now mostly only listening to you and what if all tests because
6095280	6098240	the amount of autistic research you guys do. Well, thank you very much. Yeah.
6101360	6105120	Sammy G $10. Every time I hear a dev talk about weight loss is mine. A little LOL. If you're
6105120	6108880	really serious about fixing your health, I have way better advice for you than some influencer
6108880	6115440	and no exercise needed. Well, Sammy, wait, where are you? I'm going to moderate. I'm going to add,
6115440	6120080	wait, is this you? Sammy? Okay. No, there you are. Sammy, listen, Sammy.
6120080	6129120	I understand like the gut flora stuff, because that's something you research, right?
6131200	6134800	Well, I mean, fine here, you know, I will take you up on it. Fuck it. Let's do it.
6134800	6140480	Let's do it. Toss me a DM in Discord, Sammy, and we'll and we'll do it. Okay.
6140480	6151520	Just eat tapeworm eggs. Yeah, that's what I'll do.
6152400	6156960	That's what I'll fucking do. Same even in Discord. Hold on. I'm gonna look it up.
6160960	6167360	Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Sammy.
6171120	6173760	Are you not even in the fucking discord?
6182480	6188640	Here, hold on. I have Dr. Diddler on Discord and aren't aren't Sammy and Dr. Diddler.
6190320	6198400	Friends. Because you just put me in a group. You can't figure out this girl. Are you serious?
6198400	6207440	Are you an old lady? Okay, hold on. I'll DM you on Twitter. Okay.
6211360	6217600	There is a new discord for my community because the old one is shit and full of fucking losers.
6218400	6223760	I'm making a new one. We have Sammy's a Zoomer. That's right. Zoomers can't do technology.
6228960	6246240	Okay. Here. You know what? Even though the new Discord is Donator only,
6248400	6255360	I'll DM Sammy an invite to the new Donator only Discord for free.
6256320	6262720	Nepotism is happening, guys. Nepotism is happening. Live on stream.
6265440	6268320	Hold on. Where's the invite?
6276560	6277920	And how do you get the fucking invites?
6277920	6286400	I'll just copy the one from over here. Hold on. See, I also don't know how things work.
6288080	6290880	I also don't know fucking how things work.
6300720	6304880	Okay.
6308320	6317200	Listen. Okay. Here, Sammy. I've pasted it to you. There you go. So listen. Listen. Listen, kiddos.
6318640	6329600	Here's what's going on. Dev, that's unfair to others. Sammy's my friend, though. It's okay.
6329760	6337440	Listen, for those of you who have like a recurring $5 donation through Twitch or YouTube or Patreon
6337440	6347120	or Subscribestar, then you then you get into the Donator room in the old Discord. And the
6347120	6356880	Donator room in the old Discord has a link to the new Discord. But the article's not
6357840	6362480	the articles I've given you, Dev. Artemis, you're giving me so much shit. I don't know what...
6363840	6366640	I have like 200 fucking messages from you I still got to get through.
6373360	6376960	Here. I do have my own articles you can talk about. You want to talk about those?
6379440	6382160	Is it articles time, guys?
6386880	6398400	I have not heard about the Moamax nonsense. I know that like Stardust is covering it and
6398400	6407520	Treadlogic and everyone. I know they're all covering it, but like I haven't been following
6407520	6411840	the drama. I'm sure it's fucking hilarious, though. I'll go back and look at it when it's
6411840	6417600	all been wrapped up, I think, and get the full story all at once. Also, Sammy, you're
6418800	6433360	you're not even talking in DMs. Anyway, the new server, the new Discord server,
6433360	6438720	is Donator only for now? Donator only for now?
6441920	6445600	It'll be open eventually. Artemis says, don't ask for evidence if you're not going to look
6445600	6450720	at rebuttals on the stream. Oh my god, fine, you fucking autismo. Give me a second.
6452000	6460000	Yeah, all the shit. Okay, okay, let's see. Let's see, let's see. What is it?
6463360	6467760	Read Sammy's advice as an article.
6474880	6481120	Okay, let's see, let's see. Let's read it. Let's read the article that Artemis has given us.
6485280	6489840	Is the US purposefully opinion piece? So this may or may not be the truth.
6490720	6497440	Oh, wait, Sammy, you can't have more than one tab open? Oh my god, okay, listen.
6498960	6503120	Is the US purposefully, wait, bro, get to the articles already. I'll do whatever the fuck I want.
6503840	6508880	Is the US purposely under reporting inflation? It's hard not to wonder when you look at how
6508880	6516800	it's calculated, okay. How a 400% increase in the price of a TV ends up being a 7.1% decrease
6516800	6519520	according to calculations in a department of governance. Okay, let's see, let's see.
6522240	6523200	Let's see how this works.
6526480	6530240	We're living in a world where people seem to relish in the consumption of misinformation.
6531120	6535200	That is different versions of reality and alternative facts. Some of the stuff people
6535200	6539680	believe is beyond loony. For instance, it's easy to dismiss the truly wacky stories from
6539680	6543920	the QAnon world about politicians and Hollywood elites drinking the blood of babies.
6544000	6550560	It's very, to be fair, I think a lot of the right ways that I talked to you would believe this,
6550560	6561680	though. It's very, bully Sammy, everyone bully Sammy. Wait, Sammy, here, I'll call off the
6561680	6570000	bullying against Sammy if you draw more dev fan art. I have to siphon at least 5% away of your
6570080	6574000	I have to siphon at least 5% away of your attention from Adam and Sitch.
6575680	6579920	Okay, it's very difficult, however, to detect the deception that takes place when government
6579920	6584240	agencies report on matters related to the economy. So difficult, in fact, that most
6584240	6589920	economists don't even understand it. Never mind the general public, okay. One of the most damaging
6589920	6594880	deceptions emanates from the methods used by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics calculation of the
6594880	6599760	consumer price index. The reported CPI is currently running at just under 7%,
6599760	6605680	annualized. You might be surprised to hear that the number would be close to 15% if the BLS used
6605680	6612880	the same formula it did in the 1970s. So this might be the case, but it also might be the case
6612880	6619280	that they changed because the new formula is more accurate or appropriate than the old one. This is
6619280	6624640	implying that they're trying to hide it by changing the formula, but it actually might not be the case
6624640	6629840	at all. Schnitzel says, I'm not a YouTuber anymore, I'm just Schnitzel. Well, hey, Schnitzel,
6629840	6632000	welcome back, buddy. Thanks for the two dollars.
6636240	6641200	At some point in the 1990s, the US Congress decided the old formula needed updating,
6641200	6647120	so they introduced several methodological improvements. In fact, over the past 30 years,
6647120	6652240	they have changed their methods of calculation 20 times. Making any sense of their approach is
6652240	6657280	impossible as the BLS does not disclose the raw data it uses in its formulas. In the art of
6657280	6662880	illusion, keeping a secret is the greatest sleight of hand. Okay, so this is Flare.
6664880	6668240	It probably would be good for them to disclose raw data, I think.
6669120	6672400	But also, again, changing formula does not necessarily mean that it's bad.
6672400	6686160	Every 20 pounds dev loses, I draw fan art. Okay, you know what, Sammy? I'll talk to you
6686160	6692560	after the stream about it, okay? $10, Sean King. I was talking to my professor the other day,
6692560	6696320	either of you who has a PhD in gut flora. He said they recently concluded that your
6696320	6699360	gut flora has light to no effect on your weight. Oh, okay.
6699360	6706400	Okay, the changes fall into two broad categories. First, adjusting prices based on what the BLS
6706400	6711440	refers to as hedonic changes in quality through innovation, where the consumer derives additional
6711440	6715600	pleasure from a specific product such as its computer, TV, or appliance, results in reducing
6715600	6723600	or eliminating the real life price increase. Okay, so I think what this basically means is like
6724480	6730160	the next model of TV is worth more, but it also has more features that people like.
6730720	6734880	So the price to feature ratio remains the same. That makes sense?
6737600	6743200	The approach they use is so complex, even Stephen Hawking would have difficulty deciphering it.
6743200	6747520	As an example, the following is the BLS's own attempt at an explanation of their approach
6747520	6752240	when calculating the hedonic value improvement of a TV set. Okay, let's see.
6754560	6759440	Item A is a television that is no longer available and it has been replaced by new item television B.
6761200	6767040	The characteristics in bold differ between the two TVs. There is a large degree of quality change
6767040	6777280	and there is a very large, 400%, difference in prices of the TVs. Rather than using the 400%
6777280	6782560	increase in price between item A and item B, the quality adjusted rate of price change is measured
6782960	6790560	by the ratio of the price of item B in the current period, $1,000 or $50, over an estimated price of
6790560	6799120	item B in the previous period. That makes sense, yeah? Like different eras, the TV comes out,
6799120	6804640	different prices and qualities, so you take what you know about stats and go back in time and say,
6804640	6810640	this TV would be worth this much at this point in time. I hate extra features, I hate extra,
6810800	6818800	okay, okay, snare it again. To derive the estimated price of item B, we use the following
6818800	6827600	equation, where PB T plus S minus one is the quality adjusted price, PA T plus S minus one
6827600	6832240	is the price of item A in the previous period and is the constant E, the inverse of the natural
6832240	6836960	logarithm, exponentiated by the difference of the summations of the B's for the set of
6836960	6840960	characteristics that differ between items A and B. The exponentiation step is done to
6840960	6845440	transform the coefficients from the semi-logged form to a linear form before adjusting the price.
6846160	6857280	So like this isn't so complex, this is like high school level math guys, like it's definitely like
6857280	6862400	grade 12 level high school math, but still like, how do you understand this?
6863360	6872160	Because what they're doing is they're saying, okay, TVA came out in 2010, TVB came out in 2020,
6872160	6876240	here's their prices, here's their feature difference, all right? Now with the price
6876240	6881680	and the feature difference between the two TVs and also the rate of inflation, you can now calculate
6881680	6888480	what TVB would have been worth if it came out alongside TVA. Once you calculated that,
6888720	6890720	you look at the difference, now you know inflation.
6895360	6897280	It makes sense, this makes fucking sense.
6900720	6902960	Nothing confusing about this, nothing's wrong with this.
6908320	6917040	Okay. A TV that has gone up in price by 400% is reported in the CPI as going down in price by 7%.
6918000	6923200	Tell that to the average salaried worker who just had to buy a new TV set while his salary
6923200	6927840	hasn't increased in years, he couldn't care less. At the end of the day, it still represents a
6927840	6932880	bigger chunk of his paycheck, as they say in the software world, garbage in, garbage out.
6936880	6942880	So I don't know, man, because yeah, you don't got to buy, if you're a poor guy who has to replace
6943200	6950160	his old TV, you don't got to buy the TV that it has a 400% price increase on the actual number.
6950160	6956320	What you can do is just go buy the cheaper TV. It still exists. Buy a lower end TV that's
6956320	6959760	more in line with your fucking budget. God, this is stupid. All right.
6959760	6975760	Dev, you can't question these things. If they say it's too complicated for you,
6975760	6983520	it's too complicated. That's what Forbes taught me. Nah, man, this is dumb.
6984240	6994800	Ah, like the fact that this makes sense and is not actually them like hiding the true inflation,
6994800	6998560	but it's like, oh yeah, different, like you got to calculate inflation by looking at like
6998560	7002320	different products and like their differences. And when they came out in different prices and
7002320	7005520	the kind of, you kind of eyeball it by calculating it all together. Like,
7005520	7007840	yeah, that seems reasonable to me. What's the problem here?
7007840	7016000	Okay. The other calculation method used by government statistics is substitution. Put simply,
7016000	7020880	if one item in your basket goes up in price, they can choose to change the item to one in
7020880	7027440	a similar category. Take meat products as an example. If beef prices go up, they can substitute
7027440	7031680	with chicken. That sounds kind of ridiculous, actually. Yeah, that's kind of dumb, isn't it?
7031680	7036000	If chicken prices go up, why not try some ham, cheddar instead of Swiss cheese? You get the
7036000	7042160	picture. The inflation of protein products may explain why spam canned meat sales have recently
7042160	7048160	have hit a record high for the seventh year in a row. So if they're doing this, this I think is
7048160	7054640	actually shadier saying we're not, we're going to like just get a different product that looks close
7054640	7059520	enough. And we're not going to do any of those balancing act they did here. This actually looks
7059520	7063120	shady. I don't like this. If this is, if this is how it's actually happening, I don't like this.
7066080	7072320	Thumbnail is furries talks about inflation and this checks out.
7078320	7082560	The way the weighting of items in the CPI basket also produces a distorted picture of the cost of
7082560	7085920	living, especially for lower income groups. As an example, food and beverages represent only
7085920	7093120	50% of the index. Okay. Meat, poultry, fish, fruits, and vegetables and represent a combined
7093120	7097920	3% of the index makes you wonder where the BLS people expect people. Oh my God. Well, no,
7098720	7104640	because food represents this much because there's other things to buy than food.
7110400	7114560	Dev your explanation would make sense until you realize the CPI chooses items arbitrarily in
7114560	7118480	order to produce a negative CPI comparable substitution at every level. They can make
7118480	7122880	these changes. Zero transparency says Artemis for $20. Thank you very much.
7123920	7125680	Well, let's keep going with the article. You sent
7129040	7132640	items in the basket, such as travel or not in your budget in 2021 alone,
7132640	7137200	rents have increased 18%. And as most of us know, from going to the grocery store,
7137200	7140080	all food items are going through the roof, sugar, corn, wheat, coffee,
7140080	7144560	here. Here's the funny thing with this. All right. All of you guys in America screaming about the
7144560	7148960	free market. We're libertarians. You want a free market? You want a free market is
7149920	7156800	the free market is your landlord can raise your rate, your rent 18%. You know what my rent got
7156800	7165200	raised last year? Like 2%. You want to know why? Because you don't have a free market
7165200	7172000	in renting here. You know what we have? We have state mandated rent control on all rental
7172000	7177360	properties that only allows them to increase rent alongside inflation.
7178960	7198640	My rent got raised 45%. Damn. That sucks, dude. Yeah. In Canada, all rent is pegged to inflation.
7200560	7208160	Like the initial rental price, the initial rental price is basically like they post the prices,
7208320	7213200	what they think it is. But after you've moved in, you have a right to basically
7213840	7219840	only have rent increased by so much in line with inflation. And that's fucking based.
7219840	7238080	Nationalized land equals free. No, no, no, no. Oh, fuck. God, you're not hearing what I'm saying.
7239760	7246800	Your landlord owns the place that he rents to you, right? And the government does not control
7246800	7253280	how much he can increase his rent on you, right? So he'll increase it 18%
7254160	7257760	and you free market cucks will like it. That's the free market.
7260480	7264080	Mandatory 500% rent increase to all single mothers based.
7265760	7268640	$2 from lives and does walls. Thank you, man. They're gonna try raising rent.
7268640	7280400	Let's actually do that. Hold on. Number sign. Not in Ontario anymore.
7280400	7284080	If it's a new construction, they can up their own. I don't think that's true, but let's look.
7284080	7289600	Let's look. Okay. Let's look. Hold on. In Ontario, can new constructions
7289600	7297120	have rent increases. Let's see.
7308720	7311120	Hold on. Let me look into it.
7320320	7324960	I'm quickly skimming this. I don't want to have another fucking
7324960	7327120	random ass arc. I'm going to be skimming it.
7341200	7344320	I think what this is talking about is initial rent.
7349600	7354160	I don't want to get sidetracked to fucking again, though.
7355840	7359760	I don't want to get sidetracked anymore. No more articles. Stop sending me one. Stop.
7362000	7365840	Terrorist $5 in the U.S. Rent controls instituted. More apartments get converted into condos and sold.
7366400	7371920	Do you see something similar happen in Canada? No, actually, no. Funnily enough,
7371920	7373440	that's not happening here. As far as I can tell.
7374320	7378000	I read this file $5. My second article shows that the claim of the economy returning to normal is
7378000	7382640	wrong at the CPI is a lie on top of this article. I don't want to keep getting fucking sidetracked.
7385120	7389200	Alexander Bryant, $5. I'm behind the stream, but what I think is going on is not economically,
7389200	7391440	but social. Things are really icing right now. You're going to make pretty good money.
7395120	7398480	Thank you for the $10, Alexander Bryant. Appreciated.
7399760	7404640	But what are you... Hold on. No, you're right. Sorry. My brain's all over the place right now.
7404640	7408800	You're right. I think a lot of what's going on isn't economic. It's social.
7409440	7412720	People feel like things are actually bad when they're not. That's what I think is going on.
7414480	7418080	Okay. Hold on. I'm looking up.
7426720	7427760	Give me a moment.
7434640	7440320	Give me a moment.
7441920	7448240	Listen, you guys in the fucking chat talking about research streams, this is what they are.
7448240	7451760	We're researching. Buckle in.
7464640	7488960	Hold on.
7489920	7493440	Because of some shortcomings of the consumer price index,
7494160	7499600	notably that it uses static expenditure weighting and it does not account for substitutions,
7501360	7508560	the personal consumption expenditures price index, PCEPI, is an alternative price index
7508560	7515200	used by the Federal Reserve, among others, to measure inflation. From January 1959
7515520	7523120	through July 2018, inflation measured by the PCEPI has averaged at 3.3%
7524320	7529200	while using the CPI is averaged at 3.8%. That's still pretty close.
7530320	7534000	Okay. Hold on. Let's see these two different things here.
7538560	7540960	Okay. Let's pull the data up.
7541280	7545440	Okay. So.
7549440	7550800	The consumer price index.
7553200	7558560	Blue and red lines are the consumer price index measuring inflation.
7559840	7567680	Green and purple lines are the personal consumption expenditures measuring inflation.
7568000	7572880	And it seems like when you actually take in those other things into account that they do,
7572880	7574320	inflation is actually lower.
7578640	7586000	Hold on. So the PCEPI takes into account the substitution effect,
7586000	7595280	which is your criticism of the CPI, Artemis. But it seems like the PCEPI has less
7595600	7599840	the PCEPI has less highs and lows and measured inflation.
7601600	7606160	Like. Huh. Okay.
7610720	7612160	What is this data for ants?
7615360	7621600	Ballcrafted your board, then get the fuck out. Goddamn it. Let's see here.
7622480	7629200	Oh, God. Artemis, what's wrong with it then? Tell me what's wrong with it this time. You fuck.
7634880	7636640	Yet comparison to CPI. Here we go.
7637680	7640960	The formula effect accounts for different formulas used to calculate indexes.
7642160	7646000	Okay. Different formula. Weight account. Okay. The weight effect accounts for
7646160	7650480	importance. Okay. Out of pocket spending. Okay. Okay.
7653360	7655280	Let me put it this way. Let me put it this way. Artemis.
7656720	7657200	Artemis.
7658400	7660960	Artemis, do you have any actual data?
7663280	7666320	Since the this other index doesn't show what you're saying,
7667200	7674080	Artemis, do you have any actual data that shows that things are just getting wildly worse and
7674080	7685440	out of control? Like, you know what I mean? Is there any actual data that things are getting
7685440	7688720	like incredibly really fucking bad here? You know what I mean?
7693120	7693920	Okay. Hold on.
7693920	7699840	I heard of Mrs. Other article.
7705200	7712320	Okay. This one? No, we just read this one. What's the other one? This one.
7719120	7720160	This one. Okay.
7724720	7727360	Okay. Second article.
7732800	7737760	Credit card balances spike in the third quarter to a 1.08 trillion record.
7738720	7741520	Damn. What are you all using your credit cards on?
7745600	7749760	Collectively, Americans now owe 1.08 trillion on their credit cards.
7749760	7756320	Persistently higher prices have caused consumers to spend down their savings and increasingly turn
7756320	7761120	to credit cards to make ends meet. At the same time, credit cards are one of the most expensive
7761120	7767360	ways to borrow money. What are you guys buying? Like, if you're buying food is one thing. If
7767360	7769840	you're just buying big TVs, I don't give a shit. Like, you're retarded.
7772720	7777600	Okay. Credit card balances have spiked by 1.54 billion year over year.
7778240	7782480	Credit card balances experience a large jump in the third quarter consistent with
7782480	7787840	strong consumer spending and real GDP growth. Okay. What are they spending it on?
7790560	7794720	Credit card delinquency also rose a boss across the board, especially among millennials
7795680	7800720	or borrowers between the ages of 30 and 39 who are burdened by high levels of student loan debt.
7801280	7805680	Oh, is this a student loan debt thing? Maybe. Okay. With most people feeling
7805680	7810160	strained by higher prices for food, gas, and housing, most cardholders are carrying
7810160	7812400	debt from month to month or falling behind on their payments.
7813360	7817280	And a greater percentage of balances are going more than 180 days delinquent.
7819360	7822960	Nearly one-tenth of credit card users find themselves in persistent debt
7822960	7827680	when they are charged more in interest fees each year than they pay towards the principal,
7828240	7833840	a pattern that is increasingly difficult to break. The issue really is what are they buying
7833840	7839360	with this stuff? Because if it's literally like Netflix and Starbucks, I don't care.
7840080	7841600	They can simply fucking burn.
7847280	7852880	$2 from lives and does walls are buying super chats. Thanks, buddy. Thanks.
7854560	7857200	Love the last video dev from Donald Donovan. Thank you, dude.
7858720	7862400	Okay. $5 almost filed. Let me clear this article is directly addressing your claim that it's
7862400	7867280	social because you are incapable of understanding the graphs you were throwing. That is not true,
7867280	7869760	Artemis. That is not true, but thank you for the money.
7874960	7879040	And yes, the video was great. Another classic. Thank you very much, Mr. Bra. Thank you.
7880800	7888320	Okay. Let's see. Let's see here. Okay. Why credit cards keep debt keeps rising.
7888960	7892320	Despite the steep cost, consumers often turn to credit cards in part because they're more
7892320	7896400	accessible than other types of loans that comes at the expense of other financial goals.
7897520	7900400	That's money that doesn't go to a college fund or down payment on a home purchase.
7901760	7908240	Okay. Until recently, most Americans benefited from a few government supplied safety nets,
7908240	7914400	most notably at the large injection of stimulus money, which left many households sitting on a
7914400	7919760	stockpile of cash that enabled some card holders to keep their credit card balances in check.
7920720	7924640	But that cash reserve is largely gone after consumers gradually spent
7924640	7928320	down their excess savings from the COVID-19 pandemic years. Okay. So
7931760	7936720	could it be that these people lost their job during the pandemic,
7937680	7941200	got a bunch of money from the government that tied them over, never found a new job,
7941760	7946800	and now they're just broke and poor and spending money they don't have? That's possible.
7947760	7953280	Could it be that some of these people are retards, got a giant fucking inflow of cash,
7953840	7959680	thought, Oh my God, dude, this is, Oh, this is amazing. Spent all of it. But because they're
7959680	7965040	dumb animals, they didn't actually get their habits under control. And so after the cash
7965040	7970080	flow stopped coming in, they kept spending like they still had that flow. And now they find
7970080	7976640	themselves in debt. It's also probably possible. People are retards like that for sure.
7978080	7984960	Phil Swift, $10. It feels like culture war is more one-sided than ever. Right wing presence
7984960	7988720	online isn't as strong as it was during Trump's term. From my experience, it's super noticeable
7988720	7992000	as a passive observer. I don't agree at all. It's bill Swift. Thank you for the $10. I don't agree
7992000	7998560	with you. I think the right wing is currently ascended. Um, ball craft $2. I've heard articles
7998560	8003520	are coming eventually. Um, can we get the dev debt as a tool thing again? I think people need
8003520	8009840	it. Yeah, exactly. Right. Like victim blaming. What are they victims of their own fucking
8009840	8015600	spending? What are you talking about? Number sign. Okay. I swear to God. All right. There's,
8015600	8020080	there's more right-wingers in my chat. Like people in my chat who are more right-wing than me,
8021040	8025200	but also the right wingers in my chat. They're more communist than me.
8025840	8030640	It's like, Oh my God, dude. Oh, the bourgeois, the, the bankers, the international capital is
8030640	8038080	fucking the working class, dude. It's like Jesus fucking Christ. No dev being like, I need evidence
8038080	8042400	and also dev makes loads of assumptions. Did you not just hear what I said? I just said,
8042400	8048560	it's possible. This is th this is one of the reasons it's possible. This is a different
8048560	8052560	reason. I'm not saying I'm not making assumptions. I'm saying this is possible.
8052640	8055920	Possible. All right.
8062320	8066880	It's possible that these are the cases. Okay. Here, here, chat. Actually I want to hear,
8066880	8069760	I want to hear why do you think this is happening? Chat. Go ahead.
8070960	8072800	What are the various possibilities? Go.
8072800	8083760	I almost found $20 dev. You hack. You immediately paint the people having to incur more credit card
8083760	8088160	debt specifically to pay rent or food, but claim they're buying Netflix. You're blaming people
8088160	8092240	instinctually and covering for the government. No artists. I just said it's possible. What do
8092240	8101600	you think possible means? You fuck. Okay. It's possible that these are people who lost their
8101600	8105520	jobs during the pandemic. And now they have to, they had to use all the government stimulus to
8105520	8110080	pay for rent or food, but after the pandemic, they never got their jobs back. So now they're
8110080	8115120	fucked. And they're, and they're spending with credit. That's possible. It's also possible that
8115120	8120880	these are people who got used to living high off the hog with the government cheese coming in.
8120880	8125040	And now that that's run out, they're not, they're not tampering down on their spending again.
8125040	8128240	And now they're, they're still spending more because they like that, that new lifestyle.
8128240	8132400	And now they're in debt. That's also possible. What are the possibilities going to be?
8132400	8134640	There's probably more. There's probably more that I haven't thought of.
8144880	8148080	Teres Shvinko, $5. People can sidetrack you with super chats. Can I purchase the first article?
8149520	8150880	We'll get to articles right after this. Okay.
8150880	8159040	Yeah. Great. Clay or not says I maxed out my credit card game
8159040	8162160	on waifu games in 2020. I was retarded. Yeah. Well, there you go. Yeah.
8174880	8180240	$5 Phil Swift ascending on God. Just like that. That just isn't the general question I get.
8180240	8183840	I'll be at looking at places like Twitter aren't good indicators. It does feel like culturally the
8183840	8189920	right wings on the upstream right now. It does feel like a, a lot of the ESG DEI stuff is being
8189920	8193920	rolled back. A lot of the cancel culture stuff has gone. Like the right is ascending right now.
8198320	8204640	Okay. $5 on Devin. Your stream should be called E Falk. Every frame and argument with Chad
8204640	8209280	are most follow $5. You have no evidence for your assertions. You are theory crafting.
8210320	8217760	Yes. I'm looking at this and I'm saying, what are the possible reasons? Because that is what
8217760	8222880	you do when you're trying to figure things out. What are the possible reasons? Do you
8222880	8229200	have any possible reasons? I know the gold standard is fucking retarded.
8229200	8234480	Okay. Let's see.
8239040	8243200	Consumers are maintaining and supporting their lifestyles using credit card debt.
8244160	8248960	That could be the lifestyle of just barely getting by after losing a job or the lifestyle
8248960	8253200	of spending way too much fucking money during the pandemic either, or I don't know.
8253360	8259920	It's been a struggle, said Adriana Cubillo, 25, 25 years old of Modesto, California.
8259920	8263920	My rent is going up. So even though all my bills are paid, I'm sometimes living paycheck to paycheck.
8263920	8271520	Okay. I mean, you got to move out of California obviously, but still doesn't, there's no like no
8271520	8285120	reasons given here. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. Well, you know what? We can look it up. Hold on.
8291920	8295040	Is there any reason for this? Let's see. Hold on.
8295040	8304000	Yeah. Credit card delinquencies are arising fastest among lower income borrowers,
8304000	8307280	millennials, people who hold other kinds of debt like auto or student loans,
8307280	8309200	according to the federal reserve bank of New York,
8310880	8316880	rising inflation is one factor behind the problem. Okay. Let's see.
8316880	8324880	Okay. Let's take a look. Let's take a look.
8333760	8338320	During the pandemic, many Americans use stimulus payments from the government to help pay off their
8338320	8342480	credit card debt, but things drastically change once. So they already had the debt
8343360	8344960	before the pandemic.
8349360	8352480	There's Shevanko $10. I don't think ESG is declining for cultural reasons like tech
8352480	8356000	firing is expensive. Any product that ESG can't be sustained with more expensive borrowing.
8356960	8358000	I got to think about it for a bit more.
8361280	8364800	Prices are going up. Wages are decreasing. Communist. Communist.
8367040	8371200	The free market means that the seller of goods can sell them at whatever price they like.
8373040	8375840	You fucking commies. All you right wing commies in the chat.
8386640	8393760	Yep. Low income borrowers are bad with credit. This has always been the case. Millennials. Okay.
8393760	8404480	Raising interest rates to combat inflation. Even credit card users with higher payments.
8405120	8410560	They don't pay off their monthly balance in full. Okay.
8414880	8416320	It doesn't have the answer I'm looking for though.
8416320	8422880	It's not a free market. Oh my God.
8425280	8428960	What I mean to say is, it is not the government raising prices,
8428960	8437040	it's the companies raising prices, which is completely fine within a capitalist system.
8446320	8460080	The real free market has never been tried. Communist. All of you.
8465440	8471840	Okay. I'm done with this, with this rabbit hole. We're done with it.
8471840	8475840	Yeah. Donovan Gill for $10. Thank you.
8478320	8482000	If we are talking about the economy, the stock market is being carried by seven companies,
8482000	8483840	the inflation is being brought under control,
8483840	8488400	interest rates are insane, we will all be fine. Yep. I think things will actually be okay.
8488400	8500960	Okay. Given enough time, things will be fine.
8506640	8511120	When money printer go brr, those who get it first benefit and the rest of us pay for it.
8511120	8514960	That's not capitalism. Sounds like you should be buying some bonds, buddy.
8518400	8529600	All right. It's interesting to listen to Dev because everything is framed as if the people
8529600	8533920	screwing up and the government is not to blame for this. Each solution he provided says it's
8533920	8544080	the people's fault. Listen, even if the government is to blame, and they might be like, who the fuck
8544080	8552080	knows, right? You are also partially to blame for your circumstance. Simple as that, especially
8552080	8557280	now that you've, that you've now seen what's going on, right? Like, Oh shit, dude, my credit card has
8557280	8561920	a 20% interest rate on it. Should I go buy that completely unnecessary bullshit and put on my
8561920	8566960	credit card? No, you shouldn't. And if you do, it is your fault. Even if the interest rate is,
8566960	8570560	is completely the fault of the government, the fact that you're out there swiping your card.
8570560	8580400	Yeah, that is you. $5 from a Ory. Thank you. Luxury. Good sales are increasing and it's
8580400	8584640	overwhelmingly low income households that spend money. They don't have to show off that they're
8584640	8590640	not poor. Exactly. Exactly. You got people who have no fucking money buying cars, way out of
8590640	8596000	their league, buying like giant fucking TVs, buying tons of shit. They don't need buy nice
8596000	8598720	clothes, trying to look good. And it's like, shut the fuck up. Like, what are you doing? You,
8598720	8607680	you retard. You deserve your fucking poverty. Yeah, they're, they're, they're debt maxing,
8607680	8624080	baby. They're debt maxing. I was super busy during the pandemic in a computer RMA department.
8624080	8627440	Lots of people were buying computers and now that the stimulus money dried up and the pandemic is
8627440	8637120	over. Business is slow. Yep. That's about right. I could buy buns bonds or the government could
8637120	8648320	leave me alone. God. Oh fuck. Libertarianism is not a serious philosophy guys. It's just not.
8650400	8654160	You want all the benefits of society, but you don't want to pay a government for them.
8655040	8657040	It's dumb. That's stupid.
8664240	8666960	I mean, if you want to, like, if you want to implement like a,
8668240	8674240	an IQ limit for loans, you can do that. Sure. Sure. Loans only for smart people because they
8674240	8678160	want to destroy themselves with them. I mean, think about it here. How about this? Just take
8678160	8688160	away, take away everybody's poor credit card. Why not take them away? If you're all poor,
8688160	8691840	you don't get a credit card anymore because you always can't be trusted with it. That sounds
8691840	8696240	pretty good. Right? It's like, Oh shit. I'm so poor and stupid. I spent all my money. I just
8696240	8700720	kept swiping the card. Now I owe so much on it. Oh, my life's fucked. Okay. No more credit card
8700720	8701120	for you.
8709120	8712000	The South Korea don't have the same issue. What are you talking about? I don't know what you're
8712000	8726160	referring to. Sorry, but thank you for the $2. Every millennial and Zoomer crying about working
8726160	8731920	40 hours a week and barely making rent is at fault. They buy premium shit. They buy expensive
8731920	8736880	shit they don't need. They buy every subscription service. Yes. This is all fucking true.
8738160	8743120	You deserve their fucking poverty. Yep.
8749760	8756480	Okay. My God, it's been two and a half hours. You haven't talked about any articles yet.
8759520	8763040	Maybe I should just cut down to only like the fun articles because I have way too many articles
8763040	8772800	here as well. We already have that. It's called the credit score. Now, you know what? No, you
8772800	8776000	guys, you guys deserve the articles. We'll go through them. We'll go through them all.
8776000	8780000	Let's go article time. You guys ready?
8780000	8792560	So you guys complained about me reading old articles.
8794080	8797360	Here's an old article for you from 1797. We're going to read it.
8799200	8806160	The Hatters Gazette reprints from an old journal dated January 16th, 1797.
8806240	8812960	The following amusing account of the wearing of the first silk hat in London. John Hetherington,
8812960	8819280	haberdasher of the Strand, was arraigned before the Lord Mayor yesterday on a charge of the breach
8819280	8826800	of the peace and inciting to riot and was required to give bonds in the sum of 500 pounds. It was in
8826800	8832320	evidence that Mr. Hetherington, who is well connected, appeared on the public highway wearing
8832320	8839360	upon his head what he called a silk hat, which was offered in evidence, a tall structure having
8839360	8846400	a shiny luster and calculated to frighten timid people. As a matter of fact, the officers of the
8846400	8853200	crown stated several women fainted at the unusual sight while children screamed, dogs yelped, and a
8853200	8858960	younger son of Cordwainer Thomas, who was returning from a chandler's shop, was thrown down by the
8858960	8866400	crowd which had collected and had his right arm broken. For these reasons, the defendant was seized
8866400	8871360	by the guards and taken before the Lord Mayor. An extenuation of his crime, the defendant claimed
8871360	8877200	that he had not violated any law of the kingdom but was merely exercising a right to appear in
8877200	8886160	a headdress of his own design, a right not denied to any Englishman. Here he was, wearing the first
8886160	8900720	ever top hat. The average TF2 hater. Two dollars from Dr. Nutter is now a weekly slur.
8901520	8905760	So there you go guys. There's the there's an old article for you. How do you like it?
8905760	8918720	Two teens were busted in the subway stabbing of a man who wished them a happy new year. Jesus fuck.
8920960	8927280	Here's the teens. Two teens have been arrested and charged with attempted murder in connection
8927280	8930640	to the brutal stabbing of a man who wished him a happy new year in a Bronx subway platform.
8931520	8939360	Emanuel Awa and Elias Aflada, both 19, were cuffed and they faced robbery and assault charges linked
8939360	8946800	to the January 1st stabbing that left Carlos Peliza, 29, with serious injuries. Peliza was
8946800	8951760	standing on the southbound D train platform at the 182nd street, 103rd street station in Fordham
8951760	8957680	Heights around 8 45 p.m. when four strangers walked up to him. He greeted the crew with happy
8957680	8965280	new year before they suddenly began pummeling him. Then one of the attackers whipped out an
8965280	8969360	unknown sharp object and stabbed the victim multiple times all over his body.
8970880	8977680	Jesus fucking degenerates dude. There they are in New York.
8977680	8988160	So there is something I've noticed, right? When it's black people attacking white people,
8989440	8995840	the media does not put race in the headline. They might put race in the article and the pictures
8995840	9003920	certainly show race, but in the headline, no race. But when it's a white person attacking a black
9003920	9008880	person, nobody has any, yeah, they say youths, they say whatever, but like when it's a white
9008880	9014800	person attacking a black person, they have no problem putting race in the headline. And honestly
9014800	9024000	that double standard is fucking disgusting. Okay. What's next? Oh yeah. This is from info wars,
9024000	9030720	dude. Info wars back in August 18th, Biden administration preparing to bring back full
9030720	9034400	COVID restrictions. The rollout is going to begin in mid September.
9040640	9047840	This rollout didn't happen, did it? This rollout seems to have not taken place.
9050800	9055360	Let's see whistleblowers from the TSA and border patrol have raised the alarm to info wars that
9055360	9058480	the Biden administration is setting the stage for a full COVID lockdown,
9059200	9065680	masking TSA employees in mid September. Let's see. Let's see. They're going to be,
9065680	9069600	they're re-implementing masking starting with airports as early as mid September.
9071200	9077120	Then the policy will escalate and by mid October mask will be required by all pilots, flight staff,
9077120	9084880	passengers, and airport patrons. Where's the rollout guys? It's not a matter of if,
9084880	9089600	but when the official numbers of COVID will go up and they will return to forced masking.
9094160	9098000	Hold on. The big AC. We knew about headline racism years ago. You didn't know. I've been here too,
9098000	9103840	you fucking moron. I'm just not blaming like all blacks or all whites or whatever the fuck
9103840	9109680	for any of this nonsense. See, your answer guys. Good news. I was about to get into a car crash,
9109680	9112560	but I steered out of the way. Clearly there was never a threat of a crash.
9112560	9120160	I never said that seed brands are what I said is that like this isn't threat of a car crash.
9120160	9126240	This is not the same situation. This is it's happening and it didn't happen. That's the point.
9128800	9130800	I'm kind of curious. Does this article?
9134640	9138240	Oh no, it's still here. Okay. Yeah. All right. Maybe you would have deleted it. Okay.
9138880	9145840	Yeah, dude. Alex Jones has warned that this system will bring back biomedical tyranny
9146880	9151280	and the launch of this new crisis in September will allow a buildup of control
9151280	9154000	that would allow the use of mail-in ballots for the next presidential,
9155120	9160000	mail-in ballots are already common. You don't need, you know, if you don't like mail-in ballots,
9160000	9163920	that's fine. That's one thing, but they don't need another excuse. They're already here. All right.
9163920	9175200	So anyway, yeah, listen, regardless of what else happened, this did not seem to happen.
9175760	9178960	This seems to be fucking fear-mongering on the part of Infowars.
9181360	9186320	Five dollars from lives and does walls. I've seen unalived rather than killed in a headline
9186320	9189520	regarding a murder involving the new asylum seekers. Fucking ridiculous, dude. Yeah.
9194560	9199200	Yeah. Yes. The Infowars headline is clickbait, but I'm calling out clickbait as bullshit.
9206640	9209680	Zam, as he says, Deb has a parasocial relationship. I've actually been thinking about this.
9210480	9218880	I think on some level, parasociality goes both ways, right? Because I know people who are here a
9218880	9225200	lot. I know. I know when I recognize the name, I see him every single stream. I'm like, yeah,
9225200	9228480	it's that guy. Yeah, it's that guy. Then when he goes away and comes back six months later,
9228480	9233200	I'm like, oh, where did you go, dude? Like, it kind of feels bad when someone leaves,
9233200	9240000	right? On my end, like me looking at the chat and noticing someone disappears and it's like,
9240000	9244640	oh, where did that guy go? Like, I do miss him. And like, I think the parasocial relationship
9244640	9249440	goes both ways. You know what I mean? Because, and then like, he comes back in six months and
9249440	9254160	he says, I was gone doing this. And I was like, oh, dude, like, like, we can't, we catch up. And
9254160	9260320	it's, it's, there's like a feeling of like, oh, you left, you know, you don't know me. Hey,
9260320	9269440	real STS. How's it going, buddy? Also like the people who now hate watch, or the people who
9269440	9273680	used to like you, and now they hate you, and they're on other channels, like shitting on you,
9274240	9278080	like that feels pretty bad sometimes. You know what I mean? It's like, five years ago,
9278080	9282240	you were in my comments, posting and having fun, and everyone's having a good time. And now you're
9282240	9286960	in someone else's chat. Like, you know, a lot of these audience are like former dev viewers who
9286960	9292080	now hate me, right? And I go in there. And like, anytime I come up, they're like frothing in the
9292080	9296000	mouth to say negative things about me. And it's because they feel like I've backstabbed them
9296000	9302080	because I'm not a right winger. And they are, you know what I mean? So it does kind of feel bad.
9302080	9306480	When I'm just like, oh, yeah, you're kind of cool. Five years ago, but you've lost your
9306480	9312160	fucking mind. And now you're over here, like hating on me. So I think there's definitely
9312160	9318720	a parasocial aspect from, like streamer to chat, not just from chat to streamer, definitely.
9321680	9325120	Now, the real Joe Biden $20 Thank you, isn't the argument that see you right? Oh,
9325120	9327920	it's stinky dumb dumbs. They didn't lock you down forever. So you were wrong.
9327920	9331360	The same as the left saying someone didn't get truly canceled because they didn't commit the
9331360	9339360	sewer slide. No, no, because the right always specifically said this was going to be eternal
9339360	9344080	COVID fascism, you're going to be living in a social credit score for the rest of your life.
9344080	9347920	This was going to they were going to be marching the jackboots up and down the street,
9347920	9352000	you were going to lose all of your rights, nothing was ever coming back. The right was
9352000	9355840	very specific about this being permanent, and they were wrong about that permanence.
9355840	9364240	So that is a difference. But thank you for the $20 I do appreciate it. $10 from art of us. Thank
9364240	9368000	you again, dude. Regardless of the fact that people have fought back against the mask mandates
9368000	9372080	that were reapplied, because they aren't here now. They were never tried. I never said that
9372080	9377200	Artemis. What I'm saying is like, I don't think that there was actually ever going to be a rollout.
9377200	9383360	And I think this is just a lie. There probably are times in which they try to roll something out.
9383360	9386320	And then people say, fuck you, and then it doesn't happen. And that's what should happen,
9386320	9390640	by the way, like, that's how it should be. Governments should, in fact, respond to the
9390640	9396480	popular will of the citizens. Because democracy as actually isn't a sham, guys. But I think this
9396480	9407280	was just cope on the fact of employers this time. Start again, $2 hard to have relationships with
9407280	9416480	the swarm of bees. Yeah, I know what you mean, dude. $2 from ball craft, do more 1860s articles.
9424960	9433040	Okay, let's keep on let's keep on going. Harada denies the role in Tekken eight jiggle physics
9433040	9441120	blames programmers and modelers based jiggle physics aren't a new phenomenon. They've been
9441120	9445280	around just as long as modern entertainment has been if not longer. But jiggle physics are
9445280	9451040	arguably more prevalent in video games with the like of streets fighters, sixes Chun Li,
9451040	9457520	and the entire femme fatale cast of Dead or Alive roster almost all cited examples. Tekken has its
9457520	9462320	fair share of female fighters, whose breasts are for a lack of better phrasing out of control.
9463600	9470320	While it's easy to blame the issue on Katsuhiro Harada, the longtime producer of the Tekken
9470320	9476880	franchise, it appears the ever vocal developer specifically asked not to incorporate jiggle
9476880	9483680	physics into Tekken but to no avail. He wanted Tekken's character movements to be more serious
9483680	9489520	and stiff and to stand out from their fighting games. However, much to his surprise, character
9489600	9492400	chess started bouncing once the game was close to being finished.
9493280	9497520	He added that programmers and modelers were secretly working on it together.
9499200	9503360	He eventually relented after seeing that each title improved on the physics of the previous
9503360	9507840	entry, explaining that the muscles and fat started to sway more naturally with each work.
9508720	9516160	Hey, dude. More jiggle physics. Holtsnader for $5 Thank you. I never thought that I thought that
9516160	9520560	this would be something that the government could use to coerce the population when needed.
9520560	9524400	I don't think it's happening, man. I don't think it's happening. I don't think any of
9524400	9530160	this shit's coming back, to be honest. And also, there's definitely like the argument of
9530800	9534320	if there's actually a super serious pandemic, should they lock down? The answer is probably
9534320	9538960	yes. But like, how do you trust them when they say it's super serious? Probably not.
9538960	9540800	So like, there's a balance here, for sure.
9543120	9546000	Because if it actually was a super serious pandemic,
9546800	9552640	and the government said, listen, guys, like, we don't have to do this. Disregarding the
9552640	9558720	trust issue you should in the super serious pandemic, right? Okay.
9558720	9568960	Damn. Anyway, he gave a statement in his episode of Harada's Bar.
9571200	9575120	Oh, my God, breast physics and video games have become a controversial subject in recent years.
9575120	9578560	The issue is often grouped together with the industry's still unrealistic body standards,
9578560	9581120	the improving but still lacking representation diversity in games,
9582000	9585120	as well as a sometimes purposely stunted character development obvious civilization of virtual
9585120	9594720	women. No, sexualize them all. Sexualize all the women's. And frankly, most of the men do.
9596720	9598560	Anyway, Tekken's coming out. It's probably gonna be okay.
9601920	9609840	Oh, yeah. Ex porn star Mia Khalifa uses face mask to pick up dog poo, then puts it back on.
9609840	9615680	What the fuck? $2 a whole scenario. I'm happy to be wrong. I agreed in the serious.
9616800	9619280	Yeah. Thanks, man. Thank you for the donations, dude.
9621280	9629360	Okay. The Lebanese American took her pup out for a stroll when it decided it couldn't hold it in
9629360	9636400	any longer. So she picks it up. Someone was recording. This is gross. She picked up the
9636400	9650320	dog poo with her mask, threw it away and put the mask back on. God. Mia Khalifa 27 removed her mask
9650320	9654960	keeping up the apparent muck before dropping it in a nearby bin. Viewers were then made to skirmish
9654960	9664640	you put the covering back on before resuming her walk. Oh, God. I just saw Mia Khalifa put poop on
9664640	9671680	her face. And then she replied, at least I'm not an anti-masker. Oh, my God, dude.
9678960	9682640	I just got back from traveling and I have to walk my dog. So safety first. Everyone has to
9682640	9685680	wear a mask. Some people believe that the video is a hoax. Both parties are looking for publicity.
9687840	9691840	She's still cute. It's still worth to go back and watch her porn,
9691840	9694320	but I don't think she has much value otherwise.
9699920	9703440	Yep. That's kind of gross, isn't it? Okay.
9707040	9714640	Oklahoma lawmaker. This is the thumbnail. Oklahoma lawmaker wants animal control to
9714640	9719680	take furries from public schools. Send her to the pound, boys. Send them to the pound.
9721840	9728720	A student behaving like a silly goose in Oklahoma could soon be hauled out of class by animal
9728720	9739280	control. State Rep Justin Humphrey introduced a bill on Tuesday that would ban furries from
9739280	9744400	public schools across the state and allow animal control to come round them up.
9744400	9751040	Students who purport to be an imaginary animal or animal species, or who engage in anthropomorphic
9751040	9757360	behavior commonly referred to as furries at the school, shall not be allowed to participate in
9757360	9765760	school curriculum or activities. The legislation would require parents or guardians to pick up the
9765760	9771200	child from school. Otherwise, animal control services shall be contacted to remove the
9771840	9773920	student.
9778640	9781600	There's no way it's going to pass, right? But it's fucking hilarious.
9783520	9786640	GigaChad. Everyone post those GigaChads, dude.
9794800	9799200	The Republican lawmaker previously proposed creating a Bigfoot hunting season in the state
9799200	9803360	and did not expand on the definition of furry-esque behaviors or what kind of
9803360	9806800	animalistic mannerisms or dress would get a kid kicked out of the classroom.
9806800	9809840	Thanks to the two dollars, Bellcraft, that they identified as animals.
9814240	9819600	Although the bill itself did not include a goal or reasoning for its existence, Humphrey previously
9819600	9824320	said it was to deter children from identifying as animals. People are going to call me insane for
9824320	9829280	running this bill. Hell, I say that they're insane. Women have discovered the final dog
9829280	9833120	pill. Unless there's compliance to the bill. Thanks, guys.
9837600	9840160	If you got an animal coming to school, how are you going to get them vaccinated? How
9840160	9842320	about we get them neutered and how about we send them to the pound?
9843120	9847360	The Republicans seemingly pointed to a bogus rumor that Michigan's school district was providing
9847360	9852240	litter box for students identified as furries. Yeah, that was last year's fucking nonsense.
9852800	9856080	Imagine trying to legally define furry behavior. Oh my fucking god, dude.
9858640	9862800	I don't want to see some kid go to the bathroom in a litter box in the kitty litter.
9862800	9871440	These people, those people up bare have lost their mind letting these people pretend to
9871440	9874240	be animals in the classroom. If they're going to be animals,
9874240	9877120	let's send them to the pound. Let's send them home. How do you teach a cat math?
9877920	9883440	There are an estimated 250,000 people in the USA who identify as furries,
9883440	9887280	a subculture whose members enjoy dressing up as cartoonish animals,
9887280	9893600	sometimes as a sexual fetish, but more often as a fun escape. Fucking fur fags, guys.
9898000	9904480	I accidentally went to a swingers party on a first date, but rather than leave, I slept with 50 men.
9907520	9908160	Okay, lady.
9910560	9915680	A model who accidentally went to a swingers party on a first date revealed that instead of leaving,
9915680	9921760	she ended up having sex with over 50 men and found it empowering. Her name is Kazumi Squirts.
9923440	9930560	She's 24. Teddies. Thanks, Benjamin Hardy. Thanks for the $2. Kazumi Squirts,
9930560	9936720	who lives in Malibu, California, lifted the lid on her most unconventional first date.
9937600	9940000	Where she accidentally ended up at a sex party.
9943200	9947280	Okay, lady. I'm sure you did. Luca the Vile, $2. Thank you.
9947280	9951520	Terrific decay is just what we let you know about. Oh my God. Fucking furries.
9954560	9957760	Kazumi, who wants to remove the stigma around swingers parties,
9957760	9961440	said the whole thing came out when I went on a date with this guy. We were in the car heading
9961440	9965440	to a restaurant when he started telling me about a party and his girlmate, who was just as crazy
9965440	9969200	as me sexually. It sounded like fun, so I said we should check it out if we're getting food.
9969200	9974480	When we got there and opened the door, we spotted his friend with loads of guys in various states of
9974480	9979680	undress. We had already discussed my interest of swing parties, but I couldn't believe he had
9979680	9984160	brought me to this party. Me and my date looked at each other. He put my hand on my shoulder and
9984160	9991920	said, have fun. So I did. So this wasn't a date. He was basically recruiting you to get fucked by
9991920	9998240	his bros. He was going out to hunt down women and bring them into the swinger party. All right.
10000400	10004400	This wasn't the first time that she had been to a sex party or swap partners. I'm not surprised.
10006480	10011200	The open-minded model loves being the center of attention and isn't phased by having sex with
10011200	10015920	multiple people on the same night and says that it's empowering to follow your sexual urges.
10015920	10028160	I can't wait for her to be like, you know, I've now fucked a thousand guys,
10029360	10033840	but I want kids now, so it's time for me to settle down and someone needs to come date me.
10033840	10041520	And it's like, nope, nope, fucking nope. Fuck that.
10043600	10050960	Okay. Vaping does not harm pregnant women or babies. A shocking study claims. Oh,
10050960	10054160	I mean, I don't believe it, but maybe it's true. Who knows? Let's take a look.
10055280	10059200	Smoking cigarettes while pregnant has previously been linked to birth complications and fetal
10059200	10063200	damage, but a new study suggests that vaping could be potentially safer option.
10064320	10068720	New research from queen Mary university of London found that vaping during pregnancy
10068720	10073520	helped expecting mothers quit smoking cigarettes without posing any detectable risks to the
10073520	10079120	pregnancy. The team of researchers found that after the first trimester pregnant women who
10079120	10085440	used a nicotine replacement patches or e-cigarettes gave birth to babies with birth weights,
10085440	10091280	no different from non-smokers and birth weights significantly higher than those who smoked at all
10091280	10095440	during their pregnancy. So yeah, I know you swingers. I get it.
10096240	10098480	Birth rates is one of those ways you can kind of figure this out,
10100000	10104880	but it could be something else. Like there's other ways to determine health problems, right?
10107600	10113120	There's other ways to determine health problems. I need my child dose math. Yeah.
10113120	10123840	Yeah. The data says that the data suggests that regular use of nicotine replacement therapy
10123840	10128560	don't have any adverse effects on the mother or the baby after the first trimester, nor is
10128560	10134480	associated with adverse pregnancy events or poor pregnancy outcomes. E-cigarettes help pregnancy
10134480	10138400	smokers quit without posing any detectable risk to pregnancy compared with stopping smoking without
10138400	10146320	further nicotine use. Hmm. I need to look at it some more, you know.
10158480	10164160	Yeah, exactly here. So nicotine can cause permanent damage to the developing fetus's brain
10164160	10168000	and other organs. There's not a weight thing. This is an organ damage thing.
10168000	10170960	So I don't know about this one, dude.
10176560	10179280	No, I gradually was like, are you dead or not like that? No, dude,
10180400	10186800	God, I swear to God, you have fucking brain worms. All right. Listen, when someone gives you
10186800	10193680	evidence, you don't simply accept it because it jives with what you already know or reject it
10193680	10197840	because it doesn't. You have to look at it and examine it and be like, hmm, okay.
10199360	10204160	What does the evidence say? What doesn't it say? What is it leaving out? What other possibilities
10204160	10211200	are there? All right. Fucking think about it for a bit. Jesus. I fucking hate partisans, dude.
10214560	10217200	Like, I hate this too. Jesus.
10223680	10230000	You still have a severe optimism bias. Yeah, that's because the world's actually mostly good.
10232480	10235040	It actually is. If you go outside, you can kind of see that.
10237040	10240160	Also, you know, just trust the institution to have trust the study.
10240880	10245040	Good. God damn it. No, you're being dumb. You're all being stupid.
10245120	10255600	It says safer, not safe. Okay, well, it might be safer in the same way that eating cigarette ash
10255600	10264720	is safer than eating bleach. Okay, I get it. Let's continue on. Educators are outraged
10264720	10271520	after attorneys argue that a first grade teacher shot in the school is a workplace injury. What?
10271520	10280000	The Newport News Education Association president condemned the premise of the school division's
10280000	10287600	motion to dismiss Abigail Zwirner's pending $40 million lawsuit. The motion was filed last week
10287600	10292160	by attorneys representing the school board and argues that Zwirner, who was shot in her
10292160	10299440	classroom by a six-year-old student, is only entitled to file a worker's compensation claim
10300000	10305840	because the injury she sustained from the shooting is a workplace injury and the shooting was a
10305840	10312400	hazard of the job. What the fuck? No, it's not. It's not a normal part of your job to get shot.
10315680	10319760	James Graves, president of the Newport News Teacher's Union, said the argument is
10319760	10325120	ridiculous. This is not military. This is not the police department. This is an education system.
10325600	10331200	These lawyers have started a significant hurricane in our district by saying that being shot is part
10331200	10338800	of what teachers signed up for. This is a slap in the face. Yes, fucking okay. Let's see if I
10338800	10345120	can find an information about the six-year-old. Okay, hold on. Abigail Zwirner, I'm gonna look it
10346080	10369120	up. Shooting of Abby Zwirner, a six-year-old male student shot her.
10370080	10377920	Oh, my God, dude. Guys, guys, guys. We love you, Dev. I'm just messing with you. Also,
10377920	10384560	you're the blinched, reaching expert. Thanks. Thanks. Fucking alternator. Thank you. Okay, listen.
10388880	10393120	Okay, hold on.
10393360	10400000	The student's conduct included behavioral issues at school, cursing at staff, whipping students
10400000	10407200	with his belt, and choking a teacher. In 2021, the student came from behind his teacher,
10407200	10410880	locked his forearms around her neck, and pulled her backward. He was subsequently moved to a
10410880	10417840	different school. And the week before the student, and before the shooting, the student was shot.
10417840	10422000	Before the shooting, multiple staff members, including Zwirner, told school administrators
10422000	10426720	about the student's conduct and concerns he might have a weapon. A six-year-old kid brings a fucking
10426720	10433280	weapon. Yet, the student threatened to beat up another student, and the student was shot.
10433280	10437920	The student was shot, and the student was shot, and the student was shot, and the student was
10437920	10443040	shot, and the student was shot, and the student was shot, and the student was shot, and the student
10443120	10446960	was shot. The student was shot, and the student was shot, and the student was shot.
10446960	10449920	And the student was shot, and the student was shot, and the student was shot.
10453760	10457440	Yet, the student threatened to beat up another student. The second teacher went to administrator.
10457440	10460800	The teacher has taken the bow on herself to search the student's backpack. A third teacher,
10461360	10463920	a student has searched another student, and he says he had a gun on the child that he would
10463920	10469600	shoot him if they reported it. The teacher was told to wait out the situation as the school day
10469600	10478600	She reportedly texted an unidentified individual saying that the student claimed to have a gun and the school administrators weren't helping.
10478600	10489600	During a routine lesson at 2pm the student pointed a 9mm Taurus pistol at Zwirner and then shot at her when she tried to reach out for the weapon.
10489600	10493600	The bullet passed through her hand and then lodged in her chest.
10493600	10500600	Police reported that the shooting was intentional and there was no struggle or warning given before the student discharged the gun.
10500600	10508600	The child's mother, Deja Taylor, owned the gun that the student brought to school in his backpack.
10508600	10518600	Immediately after being shot, Zwirner escorted all the students out of the classroom and away from the shooter while another staff member restrained the shooter until police took the juvenile detention.
10524600	10526600	Oh my god, dude.
10526600	10528600	Wild!
10530600	10535600	This is fucking... what's the student's race, Dev? Yes, we all know the student's race is black.
10535600	10540600	We all get it. We get it. This is some inner-city fucking gang-ass bullshit.
10540600	10556600	Yeah, this is insane, dude. And the fact that the school administrators didn't do shit.
10556600	10558600	Shit.
10568600	10570600	My god.
10574600	10577600	Oh shit, dude. The kid has ADHD.
10578600	10580600	Damn.
10581600	10587600	Don't worry, I won't shoot anyone, guys. Don't worry.
10587600	10590600	Sean King. 10 Canadian dollars. Thank you.
10590600	10597600	I think the reason the guys in here hate it when you tell them that things aren't that bad is because they see it as you are telling them to trust the tribe over the hill.
10597600	10599600	Oh god, I'm not...
10599600	10603600	If that's how they view it, they gotta upgrade their fucking thinking because they're thinking stupidly.
10603600	10605600	Stupidly.
10608600	10612600	This is victim blaming. The kid's getting justice for his phone, GigaChad.
10618600	10622600	Yeah, this is fucking insane, dude. Jesus fucking Christ.
10622600	10624600	Okay.
10624600	10626600	Let's see.
10626600	10634600	Unhinged hospital greeter, 27, has been slapped with several charges, including attempted murder and a Queen stabbing spree.
10634600	10640600	Tricky Mario, thanks for the fiver. I bet a lot of Ms. Frizzle's field trips are safe from this student. As I would say, I knew she would stay home today.
10642600	10647600	So, this is the unhinged hospital greeter. That's this guy here.
10647600	10650600	There he is, our hospital greeter.
10650600	10656600	The suspect in the stabbing spree across Queens has been slapped with an attempted murder and assault charge for the five violent attacks.
10656600	10672600	Jermaine Rigueur, who reportedly laughed in one victim's face after slashing them, was charged late Wednesday with three counts of attempted murder, four counts of assault, one count of attempted assault, and criminal possession of a weapon.
10672600	10679600	Wild, dude. Fucking wild.
10679600	10693600	Here's the thing. I think even though crime rates are actually going down, what's happening is the few crimes that are left become more sensationalized like these, right?
10693600	10696600	This is like, like, this is insane fucking bullshit.
10696600	10704600	Listen, you can recognize all the patterns you want. But as I always say, pattern recognition is the beginning of knowledge, not the end.
10704600	10715600	Like, there's a bunch of idiots on Twitter who are like, I see the pattern. Everyone is black, therefore all the blacks are in fact the criminals and that is just how it is.
10715600	10729600	It's like, no, no, no, no, that's just as stupid as not seeing the pattern. That's just as stupid as not seeing the pattern.
10729600	10734600	It's a string of random attacks. He's been doing random attacks this whole time.
10734600	10740600	A 61 year old grandfather was knifed in the back as he walked to the laundromat.
10741600	10746600	After the alleged perp stabbed him from behind, he turned and smiled at him as he walked away.
10746600	10756600	Then, a 34 year old Shanika Anderson was stabbed as she walked home just after midnight. Holy shit, dude.
10756600	10762600	Look, this guy's like fucked up.
10762600	10765600	$10 for Brian Linden.
10765600	10781600	I'd bet the reason the violent crime graph is off is because it uses UCR rather than NCVS data plus them moving to a new reporting system in 2021, forcing them to rely on estimates for 2021-2022 data.
10781600	10786600	Maybe. I don't know. It's possible. I actually do think that things are getting better though.
10786600	10793600	There are sensationalist crimes like this guy fucking stabbing randoms, but the crime rates are overall going down.
10793600	10798600	Also, hey, Sitch and Adam. Which one of you is it? Is it Adam or is it Sitch?
10798600	10801600	Did you watch my new video, by the way?
10801600	10807600	I mean, to be honest, it's a video you already know about, to be honest, because you talked about it.
10807600	10816600	I heard that you got banned for a week. That sucks.
10816600	10821600	Google users can now ask to have their explicit photos removed from search results.
10821600	10827600	Oh, dude, if your nudes are out there, you can get them taken down.
10827600	10832600	S class, baby. Yeah. Well, I like them both, really.
10832600	10837600	And also D club. But still. Hey, Sitch.
10837600	10841600	Hey, Sitch. I did. It was great. Did you? Because here's the thing.
10842600	10852600	Assuming it's such such we've had that conversation on your channel several times about, you know, the whole the the what's the problem with liberalism?
10852600	10858600	Oh, yeah. It falls apart into communism sometimes because of these these philosophical reasons.
10858600	10862600	Right. That's an argument that you've had with me. You've had it with Sargon.
10862600	10866600	And the the video is just outlining how that works.
10866600	10873600	And I'm not sure if you if you agree with that logic, but I'm glad you enjoyed the video, though.
10873600	10885600	OK, so Google on Thursday rolled out a new policy that allows people to request that their personal sexually explicit photos be removed from search results.
10885600	10895600	The new feature is one of three updates that Google says are meant to give users more control over content about themselves that is available through popular search engine.
10895600	10902600	Through the popular search engine. It is just one of the many things we're trying to do to help people feel control.
10902600	10908600	Of their online experience. Wait, I'm going to be honest, I did watch the video. I was just being played.
10908600	10913600	You mean you didn't? You fuck. You can't even lie to me properly, Sitch.
10913600	10922600	Well, guess what? Go watch it. Fuck you. Fuck you.
10923600	10928600	Sitch, watch more dev videos. You're missing out on all of them.
10928600	10936600	Sargon was on Lauren Chen's new show talking about the slide from the rule of the communism. Here's the thing, like when Sargon describes.
10936600	10941600	When Sargon describes the.
10941600	10947600	I will when you get on Discord. Yeah, Sammy, get on Discord. Sammy, get on fucking Discord already.
10947600	10952600	God damn it. Sargon was on Lauren Chen's show talking about the slide from the rules of communism.
10952600	10957600	I mean, the thing the thing with Sargon is like that slide exists, but it's not inevitable.
10957600	10962600	And also, it seems to be the only thing he talks about right now. So it's like, come on, dude.
10962600	10967600	There's more there's more to the conversation than just that.
10967600	10973600	Anyway, you can now. Oh, God, my back.
10973600	10982600	OK. You can now request Google remove their personal sexually explicit explicit photos.
10982600	10989600	Google says it's meant to give users more control over content about themselves that is available through his popular search engine.
10989600	10994600	It is just one of the many things we're trying to do to help people feel control of their own experience.
10994600	10999600	One exception to the removal policy is if the user is actively commercializing their explicit images.
10999600	11006600	OK, so if you have nudes on the Internet, you're not a porn star because like a boyfriend leaked them or something.
11006600	11015600	You can get them taken down. OK, that sounds pretty good. That sounds decent, doesn't it?
11015600	11020600	Hi, Sitch. Can't wait for your videos to return. It will be better than being here.
11020600	11028600	What the fuck, dude?
11028600	11034600	The company also introduced a new dashboard that tracks when a person's personal contact information appears in its search results,
11034600	11043600	which the company says will make it easier to users to monitor and request the removal information about themselves from Google search results.
11043600	11048600	That tool will now alert users when new results pop up containing contact information.
11048600	11052600	OK, this all seems like pretty good stuff, doesn't it?
11052600	11057600	This all seems pretty decent.
11057600	11067600	Ah, God damn it. Everything is just stretching. Oh, fuck.
11067600	11074600	Oh, ow, that hurt. Ow.
11074600	11079600	Oh. OK, hold on.
11079600	11088600	Yeah, I think I just pulled the muscle stretching or something.
11088600	11093600	OK, give me a second, give me a second, I'm just going to stretch it out.
11148600	11177600	I definitely did something.
11177600	11188600	Oh. I did something quite painful to my thigh.
11188600	11201600	Oh. I like I was just stretching and then like it just I could feel the muscle seize and it's in the most incredible pain.
11201600	11212600	Oh. Oh.
11212600	11220600	Ah.
11220600	11224600	Rub it and stretch it, you'll be OK.
11224600	11226600	Hold on.
11226600	11236600	I, I grabbed some ibuprofen. Hold on. See, listen, I'll shake my pill bottle like Ethan Ralph ibuprofen.
11236600	11242600	Oh, OK, it's like, OK, this is like a really bad charley horse or something.
11242600	11252600	Oh.
11252600	11261600	Do not rub it if it's if it's in your leg, don't risk a DVT. It's not a DVT.
11261600	11265600	OK, hold on.
11265600	11272600	Such go watch my video and then you can demand things of me.
11273600	11290600	Mm hmm.
11290600	11292600	Oh.
11292600	11304600	Oh. Oh, fuck.
11304600	11310600	Hold on. I'm going to put my leg up.
11310600	11323600	Oh.
11323600	11327600	OK, OK. Did I miss a few super chats?
11327600	11330600	Did I miss some?
11330600	11334600	Hold on.
11334600	11337600	Let me go to the super chat.
11337600	11342600	Thanks for the support, though, guys, I appreciate it.
11342600	11347600	OK, hold on.
11347600	11353600	How much do you a yoga stream, says Holston, head or two dollars? Thank you.
11353600	11356600	Why are all the Sitch and Adam show crew wrench but me?
11356600	11363600	Dev, you're basically giving them permission to bully me, which is terribly illegal.
11363600	11367600	OK, did you have to convince me to rent you, I guess.
11367600	11374600	Donovan Gill, four dollar or five dollars, thank you, as a as a regular watcher of both Sargon and James Lidsey.
11374600	11379600	Very disappointed in James's response to Sargon. Yeah.
11379600	11382600	And me, too.
11382600	11391600	A DVT is a deep vein thrombosis.
11391600	11395600	Which I think is just like a blood clot, is that all it is?
11395600	11400600	DVT is like a type of blood clot, isn't it?
11400600	11409600	Yep, a DVT is occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein deep inside of your body.
11409600	11414600	Yeah.
11414600	11418600	Oh.
11418600	11421600	OK.
11421600	11425600	Oh.
11425600	11430600	Give me give me give me a second, OK, friends.
11430600	11434600	And where's where's where's did that? I don't see him.
11434600	11439600	Where's Diddler?
11443600	11448600	There he is, OK.
11448600	11454600	OK, Diddler. Oh, OK.
11454600	11457600	My first argument is that I'm a good boy who did nothing wrong.
11457600	11460600	My second is that Sammy cannot hold sway over me.
11460600	11463600	There is that sent you many gifts. Thank you, Diddler.
11463600	11467600	I appreciate it.
11467600	11472600	You know what I'll do? OK, we'll have to do some equivalent exchange here.
11472600	11481600	I'll have to I'll give Diddler Maude, but I'll have to remove Maude from Sammy instead.
11481600	11489600	Until she she redirects 10 percent of her fan art efforts towards my channel instead of Adam and Citrus.
11489600	11493600	That's how it has to be.
11493600	11500600	OK, let's see here.
11500600	11507600	Let's continue on. Sports Illustrated's entire staff told they're getting laid off.
11507600	11512600	Fuck you. The future of based.
11512600	11523600	The future of iconic magazine Sports Illustrated looked dire Friday after the publisher announced mass layoffs.
11523600	11529600	I don't have pinpoint chest pain. I'm fine. It's just the fact that there was a cramp in my leg is just a cramp.
11529600	11537600	It's just a cramp of the arena group, which has been roiled by reports that the fabled magazine published a generated content.
11537600	11547600	I admitted to failing to make a three point seven five million quarterly license payment to authentic brands group due this week.
11547600	11555600	As a result, the publicly traded arena announced Thursday would make significant reduction in its workforce of more than 100 journalists.
11555600	11564600	The unionized workers received a memo Friday telling them some employees will be terminated immediately and paid in lieu of a 60 day applicable notice period under the union contract.
11564600	11568600	Employees with the last working day of today will be contacted by the people team soon.
11568600	11573600	Other employees will be expected to work through the end of the notice period and receive additional information shortly.
11574600	11579600	Yep. This is happening to here's the yet notified.
11579600	11584600	You have to. Okay. So this happened to a lot of things right now. I might do a video.
11584600	11589600	Listen, what if I give money instead? Thanks, Sammy.
11589600	11592600	But I like your artwork, Sammy.
11595600	11600600	Do I got to pay you for it? Do I got to pay you to do some art?
11600600	11609600	Oh, listen, Sports Illustrated entire staff like the thing about this is like.
11611600	11617600	OK, I think I think the pain is like fading slowly. OK, so.
11617600	11627600	Sports Illustrated entire staff, there's a lot of journalists, like journalists outlets right now, media sites and and publications.
11627600	11632600	They're just losing tons of people. Lots of social media. They're asking tons of people.
11632600	11639600	The layoffs are coming on and then all these useless fucking loser jobs where no one does anything of any fucking value.
11639600	11645600	They're all getting destroyed. And it's probably a good thing.
11645600	11651600	Inflation is down. The economy is great. Pay no attention to all the massive layoffs in every company in America.
11651600	11655600	Sigurður, listen, listen, they're cutting the fat. All right.
11655600	11661600	Remember that chick who like did nothing? It was an Instagram or wherever or wherever it was.
11661600	11667600	There was LinkedIn and she just walks around looking like looking really looking really suave or whatever the fuck.
11667600	11671600	And she's like wearing nice clothes. She's partying, constantly doing no fucking work.
11671600	11676600	She's constantly relaxing on the job, doing all this fucking bullshit and living the high life.
11676600	11680600	It's those people that are getting axed there. This is not part of the real economy.
11680600	11686600	They're just fucking money sinks. Eat a long yellow fruit. It'll help with cramps.
11686600	11691600	OK, thank you. Lives and does walls.
11691600	11695600	Wait, don't pay me, lol. It's more of a time issue for me than the motivation to do it.
11695600	11709600	OK. A third of Britons don't know that transgender women were born male.
11709600	11723600	What? More than a third of UK residents do not know that transgender women are biologically male, according to a poll, calling into question public understanding of the debate over gender.
11723600	11733600	OK, so are we talking about people who are so ideologically captured, they think that trans they're like, no, biology doesn't exist.
11733600	11746600	They're all biologically female. Or are these people who are just so ignorant about trans stuff that they're like, trans women, is that like dudes who want to be girls?
11746600	11756600	I don't know. I don't know.
11756600	11765600	Campaigners said that the finding showed politicians, journalists and pollsters needed to be more explicit when speaking about gender issues.
11765600	11770600	As in many cases, members of the public did not know what the politically correct terms mean.
11770600	11779600	Hold on. 35% wrongly believe that a transgender woman was born female or that they were unsure.
11779600	11790600	The confusion was even greater for the shortened term of trans woman, with 40% either being unsure or believing it meant someone who is registered female at birth.
11790600	11792600	This is stupid.
11792600	11799600	This is dumb.
11799600	11805600	Actually, what what got Adam and Sitch fucked anyway?
11805600	11814600	NBM said several bodies such as the BBC regularly used terms that further explanation, for example, in stories about transgender participation in sports, the debate over self-id.
11814600	11824600	In many cases, the terms were adopted as a result of lobbying from trans activists who often claim it is discriminatory and offensive to refer to a transgender person's biological sex.
11824600	11835600	However, the poll said that there's high levels of misunderstanding and confusion with the terms, and there is a need for language to be more explicit.
11835600	11840600	We took it down. If you get a channel strike on YouTube and you can stream uploaded elsewhere, they can hit you with another penalty.
11840600	11842600	Yeah, if you like ban evade, you're fucked.
11842600	11848600	Such an Adam.
11848600	11851600	All right, so this is funny, but stupid. Got it.
11851600	11854600	It's pretty good.
11854600	11860600	Delivery driver caught dumping grocery order on the side of the road.
11860600	11861600	What?
11861600	11867600	Why?
11867600	11873600	A delivery driver has been has been spotted dumping a grocery order on the side of a dirt road by an angry onlooker.
11873600	11881600	The video filmed in Melbourne shows a small pile of groceries dumped on the side of the road with a delivery driver hunched over the bags.
11881600	11884600	Mate, I'm watching you. Of course, it's fucking Australian.
11884600	11888600	Mate, I'm watching you drop that rubbish there. What is it?
11888600	11890600	Shouldn't be going to a customer.
11890600	11894600	The driver said the order was going to a customer for picking up one of the Woolsworth bags.
11894600	11901600	There's not even a house here. What are you doing?
11901600	11907600	The delivery driver eventually picked up the items and put them back into the car, apologizing for getting in the driver's seat.
11907600	11913600	The footage was posted to a local Facebook group and woman commenting, confirming the order was hers.
11913600	11917600	OMG, my day keeps getting crazier.
11917600	11923600	This is my shopping, she added. She said, added that her order was delivered shortly after the video was filmed.
11923600	11930600	He sped up so fast and skidded on his way out, also reversing into a bush.
11930600	11938600	She ordered $100 worth of groceries, $15 for express delivery, and the driver's like, I'm just going to dump it on the side of the road.
11938600	11941600	What the fuck, dude?
11941600	11948600	And then the passerby caught it. But like, why?
11948600	11955600	Why, dude? Why?
11955600	11962600	Okay, you know what? Even though there's a few articles left, I think I'm going to pull the plug in this episode a little bit early.
11962600	11968600	It's time to put it down. I'll get to the articles next week.
11968600	11970600	Okay.
11970600	11978600	Ooh, ooh.
11978600	11980600	Yes.
11980600	11983600	Thanks for all the support, guys.
11983600	11990600	Oh, we are at $499.
11990600	11994600	We almost hit $500 of donations today, guys. Thank you very much.
11994600	11999600	That's very... I appreciate it quite a bit.
11999600	12003600	You're very appreciative.
12003600	12010600	But yes, I'm going to... Oh, Stug brings us over the line with a giant boo.
12010600	12015600	Listen, Sammy, Sammy, I don't know if you've been here the whole time. Did you see the big fight that I had earlier?
12015600	12020600	It's a fun fight. Like, I enjoy arguing with chat over stuff, but I think I helped.
12020600	12026600	Thanks very much, videosynth. Thank you.
12027600	12030600	But yeah, it wasn't a pulled muscle. It was intense.
12030600	12034600	No, no. Basically, yeah, my leg's actually mostly better.
12034600	12039600	Like, the pulled muscle was very painful for like 10 minutes. Like, it was fucked, but I'm actually doing pretty good now.
12039600	12045600	No, it's just... It's been three and a half hours. I do want to...
12045600	12050600	Sorry, I'm just breathing through my nose. I do want you to just get to some of the things today.
12050600	12054600	But thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate all the donos and all the help.
12054600	12057600	You guys are incredible. You guys are keeping things going.
12057600	12063600	Like I said, my goal is an extra 10,000 by the end of the... By the start of the spring.
12063600	12067600	So you can actually set up... I'm setting up a studio. A real life studio, guys.
12067600	12072600	So that's the goal. So thank you very much for helping me get towards it. You guys are the best.
12077600	12080600	I'm just having some water.
12080600	12083600	Adam... No, sorry, Sitch. It's you, Sitch, who's in there, aren't you?
12083600	12086600	Unless he fucking left. He might have taken off.
12086600	12094600	But if you're still there, Sitch, you... No, Adam invited me on your channel in the near future.
12094600	12097600	Make sure you're not fucking banned when it comes time to have me on.
12100600	12103600	Make sure you're not fucking banned. Here, I'll type it.
12103600	12115600	Don't be banned when you want me on. Also, watch the video.
12121600	12125600	Anyway, thanks very much, guys. You guys are the best.
12126600	12135600	I've got to go. God damn it. I've got to go. We're going to go raid Chud Logic.

12138600	12141600	Go in there and spam him with coffee cups because Chud's great.
12141600	12148600	We're going to go raid Chud. And I'll see you guys next time.

12155600	12160600	Anyway. Oh, and yes, of course. For those of you who asked at the start of the stream,
12160600	12166600	I'm getting my medication checked out for tomorrow because I'm not going on that other shit again. Jesus.
12166600	12171600	Like, oh my God. Okay. Anyway, enough stalling. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
12174600	12176600	Was there anything else?
12176600	12182600	I know Kibz wanted to move the Project Zomboid stream to today, but I don't know if we're doing it.
12182600	12184600	I'm just going to ask him real quick.
