1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
You know what's kind of strange to me? The insistence that everything is

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,880
simultaneously political and not political. You've heard the phrase

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,760
everything is political before, surely, and you've probably heard some

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,840
progressive justification as to why that's the case.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,360
But then you've probably also heard this too. When the official Star Wars

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,160
Twitter account posted a cover for their Pride Month comic

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,520
centered on two proud strong queer women, someone replied with

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,200
don't make Star Wars political. The response from the official account was

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,200
queer characters existing isn't political. But wait, isn't everything

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,840
political? Of course, the resulting backlash to the

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,120
official Star Wars Twitter account shining a spotlight on this guy is

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,400
pretty much exactly as expected. You know, for a political faction that

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,920
talks about responsible platforming, use of social media, punching down,

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,040
a faction that I'm sure the Disney intern running a Star Wars account is a

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,680
part of, you'd think they'd know not to sic their

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,000
huge following on a smaller private account.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,640
Though, I'm sure they actually knew exactly what would happen. Look at the

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,000
fucking rage of all these replies. Here's another one calling all members

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,120
of the Resistance, Billy Lourd and Kelly Marie Trainor, taking the stage now.

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,040
Respectfully, nobody likes either of them. Respectfully, L plus ratio.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,120
Jeez, maybe the Disney intern is actually Kefls. And the exact same thing happened

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,320
to this poor bastard too. Get his ass, get his ass, get their ass. I

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,920
guess this one's inclusive. Get his ass, get his ass, yeah let's go, get their ass.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,520
It's often said by leftoids screeching about rightoid YouTubers or even

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,120
apolitical YouTubers that people in positions of influence online have a

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,080
moral obligation to tilt their audiences towards good behavior

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,520
and that the harassment that pours out of right-wing communities reflects on

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,320
both the politics and the individuals within those communities.

29
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,680
If we accept this logic, what does it say about progressive communities that

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,280
individuals within them have no problem being grotesquely racist towards

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,880
black people who aren't progressive? The most important type of reply out of

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,160
this officially sanctioned Star Wars dog pile though were the people who were

33
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,840
claiming that Star Wars is actually political. And yes, the leftoid answer is

34
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,040
the everything is political position. Stemming out of Antonio Gramsci's theory

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,160
of cultural hegemony describing how before the working class can revolt

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,360
against the bourgeoisie first they must be indoctrinated within an alternate

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,320
culture that is pro-revolution. The crafting of that culture requires the

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,000
subversion of mass media to deconstruct morality and heroism for the masses and

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,680
within that resulting cultural vacuum push pro-socialist propaganda. If you

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,040
want to know why so many new properties are garbage that promote communism and

41
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,640
progressivism while so many reinventions of old properties are simply lessons in

42
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,080
how to subvert them, this is why. Star Wars is political because when

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,080
George Lucas chose to base his stories on the specific hero myths and morals

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
that he did to a reader of Gramsci that choice was not a neutral one. It did

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,400
not exist within a political or cultural vacuum. Rather it led new generations of

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,080
people to idolize specific types of heroes and as those children became

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,520
politically active adults the particular cultural morality they grew up with

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,080
informed their politics. One of the themes of the movie is high technology

49
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,240
and romance they're the romantic human one of the human qualities is that

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,320
romantic quality that quality of honor and justice and everything that we

51
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,360
equate as human in the way we focus and conduct our lives. In this particular

52
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,400
case I was looking for a symbol of sort of a a more humane honorable way of

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,080
being a warrior as opposed to you know the mechanical heartless machine-like

54
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,440
approach to killing in battle and war. One of the main influences here was the

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,520
samurai ethic and King Arthur and the King Arthur ethic where you have a very

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:26,320
strong set of ethical rules that you live by. The lightsaber became the symbol

57
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,920
of that humane way of conducting your life. In this way Star Wars is political

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,440
because the progs view it as a vehicle to influence political change in the next

59
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,280
generation. It's not valued by them for the artistry of the thing but only for

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,160
its real world impact. Probably the greatest ball work against the

61
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,680
gramtiate cultural subversives is literally voting with your wallet. A

62
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,280
piece of media that lacks a soul and only exists to enact political or

63
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,880
cultural change is generally not of high quality. This is the source of the get

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,480
woke go broke phenomenon but it was identified by George Lucas as an issue

65
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,880
long before that phrase became popular. When Star Wars came out everybody said

66
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,120
oh it's a silly movie it's just a bunch of space battles and stuff it's not real

67
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,880
there's nothing behind it and I said well there is stuff behind it it's not

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
just a space battle there's more to it than that it's much much more

69
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,280
complicated than that. So the spaceships and the that part of the science

70
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,160
fantasy whatever got terribly abused and of course everybody went out and made

71
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,480
spaceship movies and they were all horrible and they all lost tons of money

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,680
and you say well you know there's more to it than that you can't just go out

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,440
and do spaceships. Notice just how many properties have gone through the process

74
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,960
of becoming subversive vehicles for socialist politics. The stripping of

75
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,400
initial meaning, co-opting of the aesthetic, and replacing the soul of the

76
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,160
thing with a new political message. But their politics are so broken that even

77
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,320
in their new offerings the truth still shines through. Here's an example one of

78
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,680
the best moments in the Obi-Wan show arguably was Frack. It's pretty clear

79
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,040
that Frack's a good guy. He likes the stability that the empire's institutions

80
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,080
bring to his life. His banter with the stormtroopers serves to humanize them

81
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,360
both. Despite the empire being that totalitarian nightmare state your average

82
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,000
person is just doing their job in a system they can't control and they're

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
just trying to get on with their lives and do what they think is the right

84
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,120
thing. To them the empire represents security, order, law, trade, jobs, and a

85
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,880
bulwark against the religious zealotry of the Jedi. This dude on twitter almost

86
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,160
gets it. This moment was the most real and scary Star Wars has been in a long

87
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,920
time. Yeah that's the point. Obi-Wan is a wanted man undercover. The symbol of

88
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,960
the empire should serve to frighten him. But the next part of the scene where

89
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,760
Frack and the stormtroopers are humanized shows us the point. In a

90
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,360
different world these guys would be friends but then they blow it. That's

91
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,960
like having a let's go Brandon or a don't tread on me bumper sticker on a

92
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,400
pickup. I mean just surface level here despite some of the problems with

93
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,720
libertarianism the libertarian creed of don't tread on me is still the exact

94
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,400
opposite of the empire's ethics. But there's a bigger issue here. These people

95
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,240
are explicitly ignoring the point of the scene which is humanizing Obi-Wan's

96
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,520
enemies before he has to kill them because they don't accept the idea that

97
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,880
their own political opponents should ever be humanized. I know we're digging

98
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,160
back into history now but remember when Ben Shapiro hosted mean review on

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
Pewdiepie's channel or Donald Trump went on Jimmy Kimmel's show? Progressives were

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,800
screaming bloody murder that these right-leaning people were being

101
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,120
humanized as if they were not already humans. The Prague's rejection of the

102
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,720
humanizing moment of this scene shows that they don't actually understand the

103
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,640
larger Star Wars conflict. In their evaluation there's no moral content here

104
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,640
only the symbols of good and evil. If Frack was flying a Pride Month variant

105
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,840
of the empire flag off the truck and the narrator called the rebellion

106
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,960
transphobes or something while Darth Vader was going around choking out

107
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,040
right-wingers these idiots would do a complete 180 on this shit. They don't

108
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,520
want a society free of totalitarianism they want their ideology to be the one

109
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,160
enforced by the totalitarian government. In fact okay Star Wars is political I'm

110
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,880
on board. What kind of political is Star Wars? That question is best answered by

111
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,640
going back to the source. This line in A New Hope always bothered me.

112
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,200
It just isn't fair. Oh Biggs is right I'm never gonna get out of here.

113
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,280
So most people know that the Biggs that Luke is referencing is this guy who gets

114
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,080
blown up during the attack on the Death Star. In the original release of the

115
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,440
movie he appears to be just another robo-pilot but in the 1997 special

116
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,280
edition George Lucas added back in a deleted scene showing Luke and Biggs

117
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,920
reuniting before the battle where they appear to be old friends who haven't

118
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:20,080
seen each other in a while. Hey Luke! Biggs! I don't believe it! How are you? How'd you get here?

119
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,520
Hey you coming up? I'll be right up there with you and have I got stories to tell you?

120
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:30,240
You sure you can handle this shit? Sir Luke is the best pushed pilot in the

121
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,920
outer rim territories. You'll do all right. Thank you sir I'll try. I gotta get aboard.

122
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,680
We'll hear all your stories when we get back all right? Hey Biggs I told you I'd make it someday.

123
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,840
It'll be like old times Luke. They'll never stop us. Now the 1997 release was the one that I saw

124
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,400
when I was a kid but even back then it felt like there was some missing setup for Biggs.

125
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,240
And there was. There's a long deleted scene that takes place at Tosche station where Luke and his

126
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,960
group of friends including Biggs use binoculars to watch the fight between the star destroyer and the

127
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,960
counselor ship at the beginning of the movie. Afterward Luke has a pretty interesting conversation

128
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,120
with Biggs about the trajectory of both of their lives. I may never come back and I just want

129
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,960
someone to know. What are you talking about? I made some friends at the academy when our

130
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,200
figure leaves for one of the central systems we're going to jump ship and join the alliance.

131
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,080
The rebellion? Quiet down. You got a month bigger than a meteor. I'm quiet I'm quiet.

132
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,280
My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact. You're crazy you could wander

133
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,000
around forever trying to find them. I know it's a long shot but if I don't find them I'll do what

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,720
I can on my own. It's what we always talked about Luke. I'm not going to wait around for the empire

135
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,920
to draft me into service. The rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the side I believe in.

136
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,640
Yeah meanwhile I'm stuck here. You'll get your chance to get off this rock.

137
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,920
You're going to the academy next term aren't you? Not likely I had to cancel my application.

138
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,440
What for? My uncle needs me. Oh no I'm serious the sand people have been getting really crazy

139
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,840
they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead. Come on Luke your uncle could hold off a whole

140
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,560
colony of sand people with one blaster. I know but we've got almost enough

141
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,920
evaporators to make the place pay off. I have to stay one more season I can't leave him now.

142
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,600
What good's all your uncle's work if the empire takes it over? You know they've already started

143
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,960
to nationalize commerce in the central systems. It won't be long before your uncle's just a tenant

144
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,760
slaving for the greater glory of the empire. No that's not going to happen here you said

145
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,560
yourself the empire won't even mess with this old rock. Things can change.

146
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,360
There's two notable things about this scene. First is that to understand Biggs's role in

147
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,240
Luke's life you kind of need this scene. Luke's later frustration at Biggs's words now makes a

148
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,720
lot more sense. Luke's reunion with him at the end of the movie actually carries some weight and

149
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,560
Biggs's death actually means something. I'm guessing these scenes were left out because

150
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,680
George Lucas wanted to tightly follow R2D2 and C-3PO until they joined up with Luke and Obi-Wan.

151
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,760
The first cut of the film had the inner cuts of Luke on the planet with what was going on in space

152
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,440
but it just wasn't the movie I wanted to make. I mean I wanted to make it about this kind of odd

153
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,680
couple and tell the story from their point of view. But man working them in somehow would have

154
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,360
improved the movie quite a bit. But secondly there's also the political component of Biggs's

155
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,680
speech. Biggs states that the empire has been nationalizing businesses and that the former

156
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,320
owners of those businesses become tenants of the empire. His dialogue crafts a link between the

157
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,960
idea of nationalization and the idea of landlordship where being a renter is the

158
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,240
same as being a government employee and the thing that links them is the lack of personal ownership.

159
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,480
Biggs also makes it sound like it's at least somewhat common for young people to join the

160
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,720
imperial academy to get training and then defect the rebellion when they get a chance. Now the

161
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,120
empire is obviously supposed to be a stand-in for Nazi Germany. The historical stormtroopers from

162
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,640
which the imperial stormtroopers get their name were the Brownshirts, the Nazi party's

163
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,960
paramilitary wing in its early years. Demographically the Brownshirts were overwhelmingly

164
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,840
young working-class communist-aligned men who believed that national socialism could be an

165
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,480
alternate path forward for the socialist movement instead of the communist international. Nowadays

166
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,520
the idea that fascism is capitalism in decay is one that the left clings to despite it being

167
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,480
resoundingly false. In a more general sense there was a broad understanding by people of this era

168
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,520
that socialism and fascism were feuding brothers and that each of their reactions to the other

169
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,320
made society worse. While it was liberal democracy standing apart from the two from a totally

170
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,960
different political school of thought that truly had an alternative more constructive path forward.

171
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,040
And this can also be seen in the political science writing of this era as well. Before the soviets

172
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,680
had begun infiltrating western universities with their active measures program you had papers like

173
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,320
for example a premature fascist Sorel and Mussolini by James Meisel which documents the

174
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,360
clear ideological progression from the socialism of French syndicalist George Sorel to the neo-socialism

175
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,400
and later fascism of Benito Mussolini. In fact this false idea of Lenin's that fascism is

176
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,680
capitalism in decay is disproven on the very first page of the book Hitler's beneficiaries by German

177
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,480
historian Goetz-Ali. Ali describes the efforts of Stuart Elliot Eisenstadt an American who has spent

178
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,240
much of his life negotiating reparations for victims of the Holocaust. Part of Eisenstadt's

179
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,360
work involved securing compensation from private German businesses that profited off of Nazi slave

180
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,760
labor. Eisenstadt's highly public negotiations with these companies widely publicized in the

181
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,280
media in the 1990s and early 2000s led to a distorted view of just how complicit German

182
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,760
captains of industry were in the horrors of the Nazi regime. The Nazis had no problem pointing

183
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,360
their guns and making demands of private owners of business if it meant getting what they want.

184
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,480
A fact that first came out during the Nuremberg trials. And while German industry is responsible

185
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,720
for what it did it's also important to recognize how little of a choice the individuals involved

186
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,280
had. But that nuance doesn't work very well as a headline and even back then headlines are all

187
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,640
that people read. So the idea that fascism is capitalism in decay was ultimately spread by

188
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,600
neo-marxist academics following the cultural theory of Antonio Gramsci who successfully

189
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,720
dismantled our previous cultural understanding of the links between socialism and fascism as a part

190
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,760
of a multi-decade project of Soviet subversion. They then replaced that previous knowledge with

191
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,400
a new theory that corporations are themselves fascist relying on the modern definition of the

192
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,200
word corporation and ignoring the very different definition from the 1920s when Mussolini was

193
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,680
actually writing about the corporative state as part of fascist political theory and then backed

194
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,160
up their new construction by misinterpreting Eisenstadt's good work. With this knowledge

195
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,040
let's return to the cut scenes from Star Wars A New Hope. Biggs's assertion that nationalization

196
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,040
leads to everyone becoming tenants where nobody truly owns their own means of production in an

197
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,200
exclusive individualistic manner and the collective dictates to the individual what is the greater

198
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,080
good for the people. That principle is the handshake between socialism and fascism. Meanwhile

199
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,280
in the wild west environment that is Tatooine with all of its many problems there's still ultimately

200
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,760
more freedom there than within the empire. The small landowners and businessmen who exclusively

201
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,000
own property they're less well off materially than the citizens of the core worlds but they're

202
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,960
free at least for now and they want to keep it that way. The rebellion is a liberal individualistic

203
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,480
uprising against a socialist system in decay and George Lucas wrote that story within the context

204
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,560
of a larger cultural backdrop that still understood the natural progression between a socialist

205
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,200
revolution and a fascist state. Now maybe you might say that deleted scenes don't count they

206
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,680
don't really represent what Star Wars is all about because they were you know deleted and so

207
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,480
not only their plot points but their underlying morals should be disregarded. The problem is

208
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,240
Biggs's speech slots in quite well to what we know about the empire's economy as told on screen in

209
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,920
The Empire Strikes Back. So you see since we're a small operation we don't fall into the jurisdiction

210
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,280
of the empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No not actually. Our operation is small

211
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,280
enough not to be noticed. Fascist political theory describes what they called a corporative

212
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,400
economy where guild-like bodies called corporations would bring together the managers

213
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,360
of government-led business and representatives from nationalized unions to determine how best to

214
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,320
implement state policy. In this scene Lando is expressing gratitude that his business is small

215
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,040
enough not to be nationalized in the way that Biggs described under the jurisdiction of the

216
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,840
mining guild and later in the movie the empire does actually roll in and take over the business

217
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,760
because Han and Leia's presence shines a spotlight on them just like how in reality

218
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,840
fascists would march into businesses point guns at them and tell them that they work for the state

219
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,120
now. Now then because Star Wars is political we can go back to the original movies where the broad

220
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,600
cultural understanding of the true nature of socialism is still intact and see that understanding

221
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,240
shine through in the narrative. Afterward we can go to the newest movies witness the end result of

222
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,880
progressive subversion and notice how all the ethics all the morals all the heroism has been

223
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,280
entirely flipped on its head and how that roughly corresponds with the loss of broader political

224
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,000
knowledge regarding socialism's true nature. But if a progressive were to hear that analysis about

225
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,640
how Star Wars is political I would be labeled a racist bigoted boot-licking chud who is too

226
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,520
stupid to understand politics and I'm taking Star Wars too seriously and don't ask questions

227
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,080
just consume product and then get excited for next products yeah that
