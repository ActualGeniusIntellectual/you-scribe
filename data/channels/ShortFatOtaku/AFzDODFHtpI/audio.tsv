0	3120	You know what's kind of strange to me? The insistence that everything is
3120	6880	simultaneously political and not political. You've heard the phrase
6880	9760	everything is political before, surely, and you've probably heard some
9760	11840	progressive justification as to why that's the case.
11840	15360	But then you've probably also heard this too. When the official Star Wars
15360	18160	Twitter account posted a cover for their Pride Month comic
18160	21520	centered on two proud strong queer women, someone replied with
21520	25200	don't make Star Wars political. The response from the official account was
25200	29200	queer characters existing isn't political. But wait, isn't everything
29200	31840	political? Of course, the resulting backlash to the
31840	35120	official Star Wars Twitter account shining a spotlight on this guy is
35120	38400	pretty much exactly as expected. You know, for a political faction that
38400	41920	talks about responsible platforming, use of social media, punching down,
41920	45040	a faction that I'm sure the Disney intern running a Star Wars account is a
45040	47680	part of, you'd think they'd know not to sic their
47680	50000	huge following on a smaller private account.
50000	52640	Though, I'm sure they actually knew exactly what would happen. Look at the
52640	56000	fucking rage of all these replies. Here's another one calling all members
56000	59120	of the Resistance, Billy Lourd and Kelly Marie Trainor, taking the stage now.
59120	63040	Respectfully, nobody likes either of them. Respectfully, L plus ratio.
63040	67120	Jeez, maybe the Disney intern is actually Kefls. And the exact same thing happened
67120	70320	to this poor bastard too. Get his ass, get his ass, get their ass. I
70320	73920	guess this one's inclusive. Get his ass, get his ass, yeah let's go, get their ass.
73920	77520	It's often said by leftoids screeching about rightoid YouTubers or even
77520	81120	apolitical YouTubers that people in positions of influence online have a
81120	84080	moral obligation to tilt their audiences towards good behavior
84080	87520	and that the harassment that pours out of right-wing communities reflects on
87520	90320	both the politics and the individuals within those communities.
90320	93680	If we accept this logic, what does it say about progressive communities that
93680	97280	individuals within them have no problem being grotesquely racist towards
97280	100880	black people who aren't progressive? The most important type of reply out of
100880	104160	this officially sanctioned Star Wars dog pile though were the people who were
104160	107840	claiming that Star Wars is actually political. And yes, the leftoid answer is
107840	111040	the everything is political position. Stemming out of Antonio Gramsci's theory
111040	114160	of cultural hegemony describing how before the working class can revolt
114160	117360	against the bourgeoisie first they must be indoctrinated within an alternate
117360	120320	culture that is pro-revolution. The crafting of that culture requires the
120320	124000	subversion of mass media to deconstruct morality and heroism for the masses and
124000	127680	within that resulting cultural vacuum push pro-socialist propaganda. If you
127680	131040	want to know why so many new properties are garbage that promote communism and
131040	134640	progressivism while so many reinventions of old properties are simply lessons in
134640	138080	how to subvert them, this is why. Star Wars is political because when
138080	142080	George Lucas chose to base his stories on the specific hero myths and morals
142080	146000	that he did to a reader of Gramsci that choice was not a neutral one. It did
146000	150400	not exist within a political or cultural vacuum. Rather it led new generations of
150400	154080	people to idolize specific types of heroes and as those children became
154080	157520	politically active adults the particular cultural morality they grew up with
157520	162080	informed their politics. One of the themes of the movie is high technology
162720	168240	and romance they're the romantic human one of the human qualities is that
168240	174320	romantic quality that quality of honor and justice and everything that we
174320	179360	equate as human in the way we focus and conduct our lives. In this particular
179360	184400	case I was looking for a symbol of sort of a a more humane honorable way of
184400	190080	being a warrior as opposed to you know the mechanical heartless machine-like
190080	195440	approach to killing in battle and war. One of the main influences here was the
195440	199520	samurai ethic and King Arthur and the King Arthur ethic where you have a very
199520	206320	strong set of ethical rules that you live by. The lightsaber became the symbol
206320	211920	of that humane way of conducting your life. In this way Star Wars is political
211920	215440	because the progs view it as a vehicle to influence political change in the next
215440	219280	generation. It's not valued by them for the artistry of the thing but only for
219280	222160	its real world impact. Probably the greatest ball work against the
222160	225680	gramtiate cultural subversives is literally voting with your wallet. A
225680	229280	piece of media that lacks a soul and only exists to enact political or
229280	232880	cultural change is generally not of high quality. This is the source of the get
232880	236480	woke go broke phenomenon but it was identified by George Lucas as an issue
236480	240880	long before that phrase became popular. When Star Wars came out everybody said
240880	247120	oh it's a silly movie it's just a bunch of space battles and stuff it's not real
247120	250880	there's nothing behind it and I said well there is stuff behind it it's not
250880	254720	just a space battle there's more to it than that it's much much more
254720	259280	complicated than that. So the spaceships and the that part of the science
259840	264160	fantasy whatever got terribly abused and of course everybody went out and made
264160	268480	spaceship movies and they were all horrible and they all lost tons of money
268480	271680	and you say well you know there's more to it than that you can't just go out
271680	275440	and do spaceships. Notice just how many properties have gone through the process
275440	278960	of becoming subversive vehicles for socialist politics. The stripping of
278960	282400	initial meaning, co-opting of the aesthetic, and replacing the soul of the
282400	286160	thing with a new political message. But their politics are so broken that even
286160	290320	in their new offerings the truth still shines through. Here's an example one of
290320	293680	the best moments in the Obi-Wan show arguably was Frack. It's pretty clear
293680	297040	that Frack's a good guy. He likes the stability that the empire's institutions
297040	300080	bring to his life. His banter with the stormtroopers serves to humanize them
300080	303360	both. Despite the empire being that totalitarian nightmare state your average
303360	306000	person is just doing their job in a system they can't control and they're
306000	308320	just trying to get on with their lives and do what they think is the right
308320	313120	thing. To them the empire represents security, order, law, trade, jobs, and a
313120	316880	bulwark against the religious zealotry of the Jedi. This dude on twitter almost
316880	320160	gets it. This moment was the most real and scary Star Wars has been in a long
320160	323920	time. Yeah that's the point. Obi-Wan is a wanted man undercover. The symbol of
323920	326960	the empire should serve to frighten him. But the next part of the scene where
326960	329760	Frack and the stormtroopers are humanized shows us the point. In a
329760	333360	different world these guys would be friends but then they blow it. That's
333360	336960	like having a let's go Brandon or a don't tread on me bumper sticker on a
336960	340400	pickup. I mean just surface level here despite some of the problems with
340400	344720	libertarianism the libertarian creed of don't tread on me is still the exact
344720	348400	opposite of the empire's ethics. But there's a bigger issue here. These people
348400	352240	are explicitly ignoring the point of the scene which is humanizing Obi-Wan's
352240	355520	enemies before he has to kill them because they don't accept the idea that
355520	358880	their own political opponents should ever be humanized. I know we're digging
358880	362160	back into history now but remember when Ben Shapiro hosted mean review on
362160	365600	Pewdiepie's channel or Donald Trump went on Jimmy Kimmel's show? Progressives were
365600	368800	screaming bloody murder that these right-leaning people were being
368800	373120	humanized as if they were not already humans. The Prague's rejection of the
373120	376720	humanizing moment of this scene shows that they don't actually understand the
376720	380640	larger Star Wars conflict. In their evaluation there's no moral content here
380640	384640	only the symbols of good and evil. If Frack was flying a Pride Month variant
384640	387840	of the empire flag off the truck and the narrator called the rebellion
387840	390960	transphobes or something while Darth Vader was going around choking out
390960	395040	right-wingers these idiots would do a complete 180 on this shit. They don't
395040	399520	want a society free of totalitarianism they want their ideology to be the one
399520	404160	enforced by the totalitarian government. In fact okay Star Wars is political I'm
404160	408880	on board. What kind of political is Star Wars? That question is best answered by
408880	412640	going back to the source. This line in A New Hope always bothered me.
412640	417200	It just isn't fair. Oh Biggs is right I'm never gonna get out of here.
417280	421280	So most people know that the Biggs that Luke is referencing is this guy who gets
421280	424080	blown up during the attack on the Death Star. In the original release of the
424080	427440	movie he appears to be just another robo-pilot but in the 1997 special
427440	431280	edition George Lucas added back in a deleted scene showing Luke and Biggs
431280	433920	reuniting before the battle where they appear to be old friends who haven't
433920	440080	seen each other in a while. Hey Luke! Biggs! I don't believe it! How are you? How'd you get here?
440080	443520	Hey you coming up? I'll be right up there with you and have I got stories to tell you?
443520	450240	You sure you can handle this shit? Sir Luke is the best pushed pilot in the
450240	455920	outer rim territories. You'll do all right. Thank you sir I'll try. I gotta get aboard.
455920	461680	We'll hear all your stories when we get back all right? Hey Biggs I told you I'd make it someday.
461680	467840	It'll be like old times Luke. They'll never stop us. Now the 1997 release was the one that I saw
467840	472400	when I was a kid but even back then it felt like there was some missing setup for Biggs.
472960	478240	And there was. There's a long deleted scene that takes place at Tosche station where Luke and his
478240	482960	group of friends including Biggs use binoculars to watch the fight between the star destroyer and the
482960	486960	counselor ship at the beginning of the movie. Afterward Luke has a pretty interesting conversation
486960	491120	with Biggs about the trajectory of both of their lives. I may never come back and I just want
491120	498960	someone to know. What are you talking about? I made some friends at the academy when our
498960	503200	figure leaves for one of the central systems we're going to jump ship and join the alliance.
503200	508080	The rebellion? Quiet down. You got a month bigger than a meteor. I'm quiet I'm quiet.
514080	519280	My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact. You're crazy you could wander
519280	524000	around forever trying to find them. I know it's a long shot but if I don't find them I'll do what
524000	528720	I can on my own. It's what we always talked about Luke. I'm not going to wait around for the empire
528720	533920	to draft me into service. The rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the side I believe in.
534560	538640	Yeah meanwhile I'm stuck here. You'll get your chance to get off this rock.
539440	543920	You're going to the academy next term aren't you? Not likely I had to cancel my application.
543920	549440	What for? My uncle needs me. Oh no I'm serious the sand people have been getting really crazy
549440	553840	they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead. Come on Luke your uncle could hold off a whole
553840	558560	colony of sand people with one blaster. I know but we've got almost enough
558560	563920	evaporators to make the place pay off. I have to stay one more season I can't leave him now.
563920	567600	What good's all your uncle's work if the empire takes it over? You know they've already started
567600	572960	to nationalize commerce in the central systems. It won't be long before your uncle's just a tenant
573840	577760	slaving for the greater glory of the empire. No that's not going to happen here you said
577760	580560	yourself the empire won't even mess with this old rock. Things can change.
581120	585360	There's two notable things about this scene. First is that to understand Biggs's role in
585360	590240	Luke's life you kind of need this scene. Luke's later frustration at Biggs's words now makes a
590240	594720	lot more sense. Luke's reunion with him at the end of the movie actually carries some weight and
594720	598560	Biggs's death actually means something. I'm guessing these scenes were left out because
598560	603680	George Lucas wanted to tightly follow R2D2 and C-3PO until they joined up with Luke and Obi-Wan.
603680	609760	The first cut of the film had the inner cuts of Luke on the planet with what was going on in space
610560	615440	but it just wasn't the movie I wanted to make. I mean I wanted to make it about this kind of odd
615440	619680	couple and tell the story from their point of view. But man working them in somehow would have
619680	623360	improved the movie quite a bit. But secondly there's also the political component of Biggs's
623360	627680	speech. Biggs states that the empire has been nationalizing businesses and that the former
627680	632320	owners of those businesses become tenants of the empire. His dialogue crafts a link between the
632320	636960	idea of nationalization and the idea of landlordship where being a renter is the
636960	642240	same as being a government employee and the thing that links them is the lack of personal ownership.
642240	646480	Biggs also makes it sound like it's at least somewhat common for young people to join the
646480	650720	imperial academy to get training and then defect the rebellion when they get a chance. Now the
650720	655120	empire is obviously supposed to be a stand-in for Nazi Germany. The historical stormtroopers from
655120	658640	which the imperial stormtroopers get their name were the Brownshirts, the Nazi party's
658640	662960	paramilitary wing in its early years. Demographically the Brownshirts were overwhelmingly
662960	667840	young working-class communist-aligned men who believed that national socialism could be an
667840	672480	alternate path forward for the socialist movement instead of the communist international. Nowadays
672480	677520	the idea that fascism is capitalism in decay is one that the left clings to despite it being
677520	682480	resoundingly false. In a more general sense there was a broad understanding by people of this era
682480	687520	that socialism and fascism were feuding brothers and that each of their reactions to the other
687520	692320	made society worse. While it was liberal democracy standing apart from the two from a totally
692320	696960	different political school of thought that truly had an alternative more constructive path forward.
696960	701040	And this can also be seen in the political science writing of this era as well. Before the soviets
701040	705680	had begun infiltrating western universities with their active measures program you had papers like
705680	710320	for example a premature fascist Sorel and Mussolini by James Meisel which documents the
710320	715360	clear ideological progression from the socialism of French syndicalist George Sorel to the neo-socialism
715360	720400	and later fascism of Benito Mussolini. In fact this false idea of Lenin's that fascism is
720400	725680	capitalism in decay is disproven on the very first page of the book Hitler's beneficiaries by German
725680	730480	historian Goetz-Ali. Ali describes the efforts of Stuart Elliot Eisenstadt an American who has spent
730480	734240	much of his life negotiating reparations for victims of the Holocaust. Part of Eisenstadt's
734240	739360	work involved securing compensation from private German businesses that profited off of Nazi slave
739360	743760	labor. Eisenstadt's highly public negotiations with these companies widely publicized in the
743760	749280	media in the 1990s and early 2000s led to a distorted view of just how complicit German
749280	753760	captains of industry were in the horrors of the Nazi regime. The Nazis had no problem pointing
753760	757360	their guns and making demands of private owners of business if it meant getting what they want.
757360	762480	A fact that first came out during the Nuremberg trials. And while German industry is responsible
762480	766720	for what it did it's also important to recognize how little of a choice the individuals involved
766720	771280	had. But that nuance doesn't work very well as a headline and even back then headlines are all
771280	776640	that people read. So the idea that fascism is capitalism in decay was ultimately spread by
776640	781600	neo-marxist academics following the cultural theory of Antonio Gramsci who successfully
781600	786720	dismantled our previous cultural understanding of the links between socialism and fascism as a part
786720	791760	of a multi-decade project of Soviet subversion. They then replaced that previous knowledge with
791760	796400	a new theory that corporations are themselves fascist relying on the modern definition of the
796400	801200	word corporation and ignoring the very different definition from the 1920s when Mussolini was
801200	805680	actually writing about the corporative state as part of fascist political theory and then backed
805680	810160	up their new construction by misinterpreting Eisenstadt's good work. With this knowledge
810160	815040	let's return to the cut scenes from Star Wars A New Hope. Biggs's assertion that nationalization
815040	819040	leads to everyone becoming tenants where nobody truly owns their own means of production in an
819040	823200	exclusive individualistic manner and the collective dictates to the individual what is the greater
823200	828080	good for the people. That principle is the handshake between socialism and fascism. Meanwhile
828080	833280	in the wild west environment that is Tatooine with all of its many problems there's still ultimately
833360	837760	more freedom there than within the empire. The small landowners and businessmen who exclusively
837760	842000	own property they're less well off materially than the citizens of the core worlds but they're
842000	846960	free at least for now and they want to keep it that way. The rebellion is a liberal individualistic
846960	852480	uprising against a socialist system in decay and George Lucas wrote that story within the context
852480	856560	of a larger cultural backdrop that still understood the natural progression between a socialist
856560	861200	revolution and a fascist state. Now maybe you might say that deleted scenes don't count they
861200	865680	don't really represent what Star Wars is all about because they were you know deleted and so
865680	870480	not only their plot points but their underlying morals should be disregarded. The problem is
870480	876240	Biggs's speech slots in quite well to what we know about the empire's economy as told on screen in
876240	881920	The Empire Strikes Back. So you see since we're a small operation we don't fall into the jurisdiction
881920	887280	of the empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No not actually. Our operation is small
887280	891280	enough not to be noticed. Fascist political theory describes what they called a corporative
891280	896400	economy where guild-like bodies called corporations would bring together the managers
896400	901360	of government-led business and representatives from nationalized unions to determine how best to
901360	906320	implement state policy. In this scene Lando is expressing gratitude that his business is small
906320	911040	enough not to be nationalized in the way that Biggs described under the jurisdiction of the
911040	915840	mining guild and later in the movie the empire does actually roll in and take over the business
915920	919760	because Han and Leia's presence shines a spotlight on them just like how in reality
919760	923840	fascists would march into businesses point guns at them and tell them that they work for the state
923840	929120	now. Now then because Star Wars is political we can go back to the original movies where the broad
929120	933600	cultural understanding of the true nature of socialism is still intact and see that understanding
933600	938240	shine through in the narrative. Afterward we can go to the newest movies witness the end result of
938240	942880	progressive subversion and notice how all the ethics all the morals all the heroism has been
942880	947280	entirely flipped on its head and how that roughly corresponds with the loss of broader political
947280	952000	knowledge regarding socialism's true nature. But if a progressive were to hear that analysis about
952000	956640	how Star Wars is political I would be labeled a racist bigoted boot-licking chud who is too
956640	961520	stupid to understand politics and I'm taking Star Wars too seriously and don't ask questions
961520	966080	just consume product and then get excited for next products yeah that
