00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
You know what's kind of strange to me? The insistence that everything is

00:03.120 --> 00:06.880
simultaneously political and not political. You've heard the phrase

00:06.880 --> 00:09.760
everything is political before, surely, and you've probably heard some

00:09.760 --> 00:11.840
progressive justification as to why that's the case.

00:11.840 --> 00:15.360
But then you've probably also heard this too. When the official Star Wars

00:15.360 --> 00:18.160
Twitter account posted a cover for their Pride Month comic

00:18.160 --> 00:21.520
centered on two proud strong queer women, someone replied with

00:21.520 --> 00:25.200
don't make Star Wars political. The response from the official account was

00:25.200 --> 00:29.200
queer characters existing isn't political. But wait, isn't everything

00:29.200 --> 00:31.840
political? Of course, the resulting backlash to the

00:31.840 --> 00:35.120
official Star Wars Twitter account shining a spotlight on this guy is

00:35.120 --> 00:38.400
pretty much exactly as expected. You know, for a political faction that

00:38.400 --> 00:41.920
talks about responsible platforming, use of social media, punching down,

00:41.920 --> 00:45.040
a faction that I'm sure the Disney intern running a Star Wars account is a

00:45.040 --> 00:47.680
part of, you'd think they'd know not to sic their

00:47.680 --> 00:50.000
huge following on a smaller private account.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.640
Though, I'm sure they actually knew exactly what would happen. Look at the

00:52.640 --> 00:56.000
fucking rage of all these replies. Here's another one calling all members

00:56.000 --> 00:59.120
of the Resistance, Billy Lourd and Kelly Marie Trainor, taking the stage now.

00:59.120 --> 01:03.040
Respectfully, nobody likes either of them. Respectfully, L plus ratio.

01:03.040 --> 01:07.120
Jeez, maybe the Disney intern is actually Kefls. And the exact same thing happened

01:07.120 --> 01:10.320
to this poor bastard too. Get his ass, get his ass, get their ass. I

01:10.320 --> 01:13.920
guess this one's inclusive. Get his ass, get his ass, yeah let's go, get their ass.

01:13.920 --> 01:17.520
It's often said by leftoids screeching about rightoid YouTubers or even

01:17.520 --> 01:21.120
apolitical YouTubers that people in positions of influence online have a

01:21.120 --> 01:24.080
moral obligation to tilt their audiences towards good behavior

01:24.080 --> 01:27.520
and that the harassment that pours out of right-wing communities reflects on

01:27.520 --> 01:30.320
both the politics and the individuals within those communities.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.680
If we accept this logic, what does it say about progressive communities that

01:33.680 --> 01:37.280
individuals within them have no problem being grotesquely racist towards

01:37.280 --> 01:40.880
black people who aren't progressive? The most important type of reply out of

01:40.880 --> 01:44.160
this officially sanctioned Star Wars dog pile though were the people who were

01:44.160 --> 01:47.840
claiming that Star Wars is actually political. And yes, the leftoid answer is

01:47.840 --> 01:51.040
the everything is political position. Stemming out of Antonio Gramsci's theory

01:51.040 --> 01:54.160
of cultural hegemony describing how before the working class can revolt

01:54.160 --> 01:57.360
against the bourgeoisie first they must be indoctrinated within an alternate

01:57.360 --> 02:00.320
culture that is pro-revolution. The crafting of that culture requires the

02:00.320 --> 02:04.000
subversion of mass media to deconstruct morality and heroism for the masses and

02:04.000 --> 02:07.680
within that resulting cultural vacuum push pro-socialist propaganda. If you

02:07.680 --> 02:11.040
want to know why so many new properties are garbage that promote communism and

02:11.040 --> 02:14.640
progressivism while so many reinventions of old properties are simply lessons in

02:14.640 --> 02:18.080
how to subvert them, this is why. Star Wars is political because when

02:18.080 --> 02:22.080
George Lucas chose to base his stories on the specific hero myths and morals

02:22.080 --> 02:26.000
that he did to a reader of Gramsci that choice was not a neutral one. It did

02:26.000 --> 02:30.400
not exist within a political or cultural vacuum. Rather it led new generations of

02:30.400 --> 02:34.080
people to idolize specific types of heroes and as those children became

02:34.080 --> 02:37.520
politically active adults the particular cultural morality they grew up with

02:37.520 --> 02:42.080
informed their politics. One of the themes of the movie is high technology

02:42.720 --> 02:48.240
and romance they're the romantic human one of the human qualities is that

02:48.240 --> 02:54.320
romantic quality that quality of honor and justice and everything that we

02:54.320 --> 02:59.360
equate as human in the way we focus and conduct our lives. In this particular

02:59.360 --> 03:04.400
case I was looking for a symbol of sort of a a more humane honorable way of

03:04.400 --> 03:10.080
being a warrior as opposed to you know the mechanical heartless machine-like

03:10.080 --> 03:15.440
approach to killing in battle and war. One of the main influences here was the

03:15.440 --> 03:19.520
samurai ethic and King Arthur and the King Arthur ethic where you have a very

03:19.520 --> 03:26.320
strong set of ethical rules that you live by. The lightsaber became the symbol

03:26.320 --> 03:31.920
of that humane way of conducting your life. In this way Star Wars is political

03:31.920 --> 03:35.440
because the progs view it as a vehicle to influence political change in the next

03:35.440 --> 03:39.280
generation. It's not valued by them for the artistry of the thing but only for

03:39.280 --> 03:42.160
its real world impact. Probably the greatest ball work against the

03:42.160 --> 03:45.680
gramtiate cultural subversives is literally voting with your wallet. A

03:45.680 --> 03:49.280
piece of media that lacks a soul and only exists to enact political or

03:49.280 --> 03:52.880
cultural change is generally not of high quality. This is the source of the get

03:52.880 --> 03:56.480
woke go broke phenomenon but it was identified by George Lucas as an issue

03:56.480 --> 04:00.880
long before that phrase became popular. When Star Wars came out everybody said

04:00.880 --> 04:07.120
oh it's a silly movie it's just a bunch of space battles and stuff it's not real

04:07.120 --> 04:10.880
there's nothing behind it and I said well there is stuff behind it it's not

04:10.880 --> 04:14.720
just a space battle there's more to it than that it's much much more

04:14.720 --> 04:19.280
complicated than that. So the spaceships and the that part of the science

04:19.840 --> 04:24.160
fantasy whatever got terribly abused and of course everybody went out and made

04:24.160 --> 04:28.480
spaceship movies and they were all horrible and they all lost tons of money

04:28.480 --> 04:31.680
and you say well you know there's more to it than that you can't just go out

04:31.680 --> 04:35.440
and do spaceships. Notice just how many properties have gone through the process

04:35.440 --> 04:38.960
of becoming subversive vehicles for socialist politics. The stripping of

04:38.960 --> 04:42.400
initial meaning, co-opting of the aesthetic, and replacing the soul of the

04:42.400 --> 04:46.160
thing with a new political message. But their politics are so broken that even

04:46.160 --> 04:50.320
in their new offerings the truth still shines through. Here's an example one of

04:50.320 --> 04:53.680
the best moments in the Obi-Wan show arguably was Frack. It's pretty clear

04:53.680 --> 04:57.040
that Frack's a good guy. He likes the stability that the empire's institutions

04:57.040 --> 05:00.080
bring to his life. His banter with the stormtroopers serves to humanize them

05:00.080 --> 05:03.360
both. Despite the empire being that totalitarian nightmare state your average

05:03.360 --> 05:06.000
person is just doing their job in a system they can't control and they're

05:06.000 --> 05:08.320
just trying to get on with their lives and do what they think is the right

05:08.320 --> 05:13.120
thing. To them the empire represents security, order, law, trade, jobs, and a

05:13.120 --> 05:16.880
bulwark against the religious zealotry of the Jedi. This dude on twitter almost

05:16.880 --> 05:20.160
gets it. This moment was the most real and scary Star Wars has been in a long

05:20.160 --> 05:23.920
time. Yeah that's the point. Obi-Wan is a wanted man undercover. The symbol of

05:23.920 --> 05:26.960
the empire should serve to frighten him. But the next part of the scene where

05:26.960 --> 05:29.760
Frack and the stormtroopers are humanized shows us the point. In a

05:29.760 --> 05:33.360
different world these guys would be friends but then they blow it. That's

05:33.360 --> 05:36.960
like having a let's go Brandon or a don't tread on me bumper sticker on a

05:36.960 --> 05:40.400
pickup. I mean just surface level here despite some of the problems with

05:40.400 --> 05:44.720
libertarianism the libertarian creed of don't tread on me is still the exact

05:44.720 --> 05:48.400
opposite of the empire's ethics. But there's a bigger issue here. These people

05:48.400 --> 05:52.240
are explicitly ignoring the point of the scene which is humanizing Obi-Wan's

05:52.240 --> 05:55.520
enemies before he has to kill them because they don't accept the idea that

05:55.520 --> 05:58.880
their own political opponents should ever be humanized. I know we're digging

05:58.880 --> 06:02.160
back into history now but remember when Ben Shapiro hosted mean review on

06:02.160 --> 06:05.600
Pewdiepie's channel or Donald Trump went on Jimmy Kimmel's show? Progressives were

06:05.600 --> 06:08.800
screaming bloody murder that these right-leaning people were being

06:08.800 --> 06:13.120
humanized as if they were not already humans. The Prague's rejection of the

06:13.120 --> 06:16.720
humanizing moment of this scene shows that they don't actually understand the

06:16.720 --> 06:20.640
larger Star Wars conflict. In their evaluation there's no moral content here

06:20.640 --> 06:24.640
only the symbols of good and evil. If Frack was flying a Pride Month variant

06:24.640 --> 06:27.840
of the empire flag off the truck and the narrator called the rebellion

06:27.840 --> 06:30.960
transphobes or something while Darth Vader was going around choking out

06:30.960 --> 06:35.040
right-wingers these idiots would do a complete 180 on this shit. They don't

06:35.040 --> 06:39.520
want a society free of totalitarianism they want their ideology to be the one

06:39.520 --> 06:44.160
enforced by the totalitarian government. In fact okay Star Wars is political I'm

06:44.160 --> 06:48.880
on board. What kind of political is Star Wars? That question is best answered by

06:48.880 --> 06:52.640
going back to the source. This line in A New Hope always bothered me.

06:52.640 --> 06:57.200
It just isn't fair. Oh Biggs is right I'm never gonna get out of here.

06:57.280 --> 07:01.280
So most people know that the Biggs that Luke is referencing is this guy who gets

07:01.280 --> 07:04.080
blown up during the attack on the Death Star. In the original release of the

07:04.080 --> 07:07.440
movie he appears to be just another robo-pilot but in the 1997 special

07:07.440 --> 07:11.280
edition George Lucas added back in a deleted scene showing Luke and Biggs

07:11.280 --> 07:13.920
reuniting before the battle where they appear to be old friends who haven't

07:13.920 --> 07:20.080
seen each other in a while. Hey Luke! Biggs! I don't believe it! How are you? How'd you get here?

07:20.080 --> 07:23.520
Hey you coming up? I'll be right up there with you and have I got stories to tell you?

07:23.520 --> 07:30.240
You sure you can handle this shit? Sir Luke is the best pushed pilot in the

07:30.240 --> 07:35.920
outer rim territories. You'll do all right. Thank you sir I'll try. I gotta get aboard.

07:35.920 --> 07:41.680
We'll hear all your stories when we get back all right? Hey Biggs I told you I'd make it someday.

07:41.680 --> 07:47.840
It'll be like old times Luke. They'll never stop us. Now the 1997 release was the one that I saw

07:47.840 --> 07:52.400
when I was a kid but even back then it felt like there was some missing setup for Biggs.

07:52.960 --> 07:58.240
And there was. There's a long deleted scene that takes place at Tosche station where Luke and his

07:58.240 --> 08:02.960
group of friends including Biggs use binoculars to watch the fight between the star destroyer and the

08:02.960 --> 08:06.960
counselor ship at the beginning of the movie. Afterward Luke has a pretty interesting conversation

08:06.960 --> 08:11.120
with Biggs about the trajectory of both of their lives. I may never come back and I just want

08:11.120 --> 08:18.960
someone to know. What are you talking about? I made some friends at the academy when our

08:18.960 --> 08:23.200
figure leaves for one of the central systems we're going to jump ship and join the alliance.

08:23.200 --> 08:28.080
The rebellion? Quiet down. You got a month bigger than a meteor. I'm quiet I'm quiet.

08:34.080 --> 08:39.280
My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make contact. You're crazy you could wander

08:39.280 --> 08:44.000
around forever trying to find them. I know it's a long shot but if I don't find them I'll do what

08:44.000 --> 08:48.720
I can on my own. It's what we always talked about Luke. I'm not going to wait around for the empire

08:48.720 --> 08:53.920
to draft me into service. The rebellion is spreading and I want to be on the side I believe in.

08:54.560 --> 08:58.640
Yeah meanwhile I'm stuck here. You'll get your chance to get off this rock.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.920
You're going to the academy next term aren't you? Not likely I had to cancel my application.

09:03.920 --> 09:09.440
What for? My uncle needs me. Oh no I'm serious the sand people have been getting really crazy

09:09.440 --> 09:13.840
they've even raided the outskirts of Anchorhead. Come on Luke your uncle could hold off a whole

09:13.840 --> 09:18.560
colony of sand people with one blaster. I know but we've got almost enough

09:18.560 --> 09:23.920
evaporators to make the place pay off. I have to stay one more season I can't leave him now.

09:23.920 --> 09:27.600
What good's all your uncle's work if the empire takes it over? You know they've already started

09:27.600 --> 09:32.960
to nationalize commerce in the central systems. It won't be long before your uncle's just a tenant

09:33.840 --> 09:37.760
slaving for the greater glory of the empire. No that's not going to happen here you said

09:37.760 --> 09:40.560
yourself the empire won't even mess with this old rock. Things can change.

09:41.120 --> 09:45.360
There's two notable things about this scene. First is that to understand Biggs's role in

09:45.360 --> 09:50.240
Luke's life you kind of need this scene. Luke's later frustration at Biggs's words now makes a

09:50.240 --> 09:54.720
lot more sense. Luke's reunion with him at the end of the movie actually carries some weight and

09:54.720 --> 09:58.560
Biggs's death actually means something. I'm guessing these scenes were left out because

09:58.560 --> 10:03.680
George Lucas wanted to tightly follow R2D2 and C-3PO until they joined up with Luke and Obi-Wan.

10:03.680 --> 10:09.760
The first cut of the film had the inner cuts of Luke on the planet with what was going on in space

10:10.560 --> 10:15.440
but it just wasn't the movie I wanted to make. I mean I wanted to make it about this kind of odd

10:15.440 --> 10:19.680
couple and tell the story from their point of view. But man working them in somehow would have

10:19.680 --> 10:23.360
improved the movie quite a bit. But secondly there's also the political component of Biggs's

10:23.360 --> 10:27.680
speech. Biggs states that the empire has been nationalizing businesses and that the former

10:27.680 --> 10:32.320
owners of those businesses become tenants of the empire. His dialogue crafts a link between the

10:32.320 --> 10:36.960
idea of nationalization and the idea of landlordship where being a renter is the

10:36.960 --> 10:42.240
same as being a government employee and the thing that links them is the lack of personal ownership.

10:42.240 --> 10:46.480
Biggs also makes it sound like it's at least somewhat common for young people to join the

10:46.480 --> 10:50.720
imperial academy to get training and then defect the rebellion when they get a chance. Now the

10:50.720 --> 10:55.120
empire is obviously supposed to be a stand-in for Nazi Germany. The historical stormtroopers from

10:55.120 --> 10:58.640
which the imperial stormtroopers get their name were the Brownshirts, the Nazi party's

10:58.640 --> 11:02.960
paramilitary wing in its early years. Demographically the Brownshirts were overwhelmingly

11:02.960 --> 11:07.840
young working-class communist-aligned men who believed that national socialism could be an

11:07.840 --> 11:12.480
alternate path forward for the socialist movement instead of the communist international. Nowadays

11:12.480 --> 11:17.520
the idea that fascism is capitalism in decay is one that the left clings to despite it being

11:17.520 --> 11:22.480
resoundingly false. In a more general sense there was a broad understanding by people of this era

11:22.480 --> 11:27.520
that socialism and fascism were feuding brothers and that each of their reactions to the other

11:27.520 --> 11:32.320
made society worse. While it was liberal democracy standing apart from the two from a totally

11:32.320 --> 11:36.960
different political school of thought that truly had an alternative more constructive path forward.

11:36.960 --> 11:41.040
And this can also be seen in the political science writing of this era as well. Before the soviets

11:41.040 --> 11:45.680
had begun infiltrating western universities with their active measures program you had papers like

11:45.680 --> 11:50.320
for example a premature fascist Sorel and Mussolini by James Meisel which documents the

11:50.320 --> 11:55.360
clear ideological progression from the socialism of French syndicalist George Sorel to the neo-socialism

11:55.360 --> 12:00.400
and later fascism of Benito Mussolini. In fact this false idea of Lenin's that fascism is

12:00.400 --> 12:05.680
capitalism in decay is disproven on the very first page of the book Hitler's beneficiaries by German

12:05.680 --> 12:10.480
historian Goetz-Ali. Ali describes the efforts of Stuart Elliot Eisenstadt an American who has spent

12:10.480 --> 12:14.240
much of his life negotiating reparations for victims of the Holocaust. Part of Eisenstadt's

12:14.240 --> 12:19.360
work involved securing compensation from private German businesses that profited off of Nazi slave

12:19.360 --> 12:23.760
labor. Eisenstadt's highly public negotiations with these companies widely publicized in the

12:23.760 --> 12:29.280
media in the 1990s and early 2000s led to a distorted view of just how complicit German

12:29.280 --> 12:33.760
captains of industry were in the horrors of the Nazi regime. The Nazis had no problem pointing

12:33.760 --> 12:37.360
their guns and making demands of private owners of business if it meant getting what they want.

12:37.360 --> 12:42.480
A fact that first came out during the Nuremberg trials. And while German industry is responsible

12:42.480 --> 12:46.720
for what it did it's also important to recognize how little of a choice the individuals involved

12:46.720 --> 12:51.280
had. But that nuance doesn't work very well as a headline and even back then headlines are all

12:51.280 --> 12:56.640
that people read. So the idea that fascism is capitalism in decay was ultimately spread by

12:56.640 --> 13:01.600
neo-marxist academics following the cultural theory of Antonio Gramsci who successfully

13:01.600 --> 13:06.720
dismantled our previous cultural understanding of the links between socialism and fascism as a part

13:06.720 --> 13:11.760
of a multi-decade project of Soviet subversion. They then replaced that previous knowledge with

13:11.760 --> 13:16.400
a new theory that corporations are themselves fascist relying on the modern definition of the

13:16.400 --> 13:21.200
word corporation and ignoring the very different definition from the 1920s when Mussolini was

13:21.200 --> 13:25.680
actually writing about the corporative state as part of fascist political theory and then backed

13:25.680 --> 13:30.160
up their new construction by misinterpreting Eisenstadt's good work. With this knowledge

13:30.160 --> 13:35.040
let's return to the cut scenes from Star Wars A New Hope. Biggs's assertion that nationalization

13:35.040 --> 13:39.040
leads to everyone becoming tenants where nobody truly owns their own means of production in an

13:39.040 --> 13:43.200
exclusive individualistic manner and the collective dictates to the individual what is the greater

13:43.200 --> 13:48.080
good for the people. That principle is the handshake between socialism and fascism. Meanwhile

13:48.080 --> 13:53.280
in the wild west environment that is Tatooine with all of its many problems there's still ultimately

13:53.360 --> 13:57.760
more freedom there than within the empire. The small landowners and businessmen who exclusively

13:57.760 --> 14:02.000
own property they're less well off materially than the citizens of the core worlds but they're

14:02.000 --> 14:06.960
free at least for now and they want to keep it that way. The rebellion is a liberal individualistic

14:06.960 --> 14:12.480
uprising against a socialist system in decay and George Lucas wrote that story within the context

14:12.480 --> 14:16.560
of a larger cultural backdrop that still understood the natural progression between a socialist

14:16.560 --> 14:21.200
revolution and a fascist state. Now maybe you might say that deleted scenes don't count they

14:21.200 --> 14:25.680
don't really represent what Star Wars is all about because they were you know deleted and so

14:25.680 --> 14:30.480
not only their plot points but their underlying morals should be disregarded. The problem is

14:30.480 --> 14:36.240
Biggs's speech slots in quite well to what we know about the empire's economy as told on screen in

14:36.240 --> 14:41.920
The Empire Strikes Back. So you see since we're a small operation we don't fall into the jurisdiction

14:41.920 --> 14:47.280
of the empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No not actually. Our operation is small

14:47.280 --> 14:51.280
enough not to be noticed. Fascist political theory describes what they called a corporative

14:51.280 --> 14:56.400
economy where guild-like bodies called corporations would bring together the managers

14:56.400 --> 15:01.360
of government-led business and representatives from nationalized unions to determine how best to

15:01.360 --> 15:06.320
implement state policy. In this scene Lando is expressing gratitude that his business is small

15:06.320 --> 15:11.040
enough not to be nationalized in the way that Biggs described under the jurisdiction of the

15:11.040 --> 15:15.840
mining guild and later in the movie the empire does actually roll in and take over the business

15:15.920 --> 15:19.760
because Han and Leia's presence shines a spotlight on them just like how in reality

15:19.760 --> 15:23.840
fascists would march into businesses point guns at them and tell them that they work for the state

15:23.840 --> 15:29.120
now. Now then because Star Wars is political we can go back to the original movies where the broad

15:29.120 --> 15:33.600
cultural understanding of the true nature of socialism is still intact and see that understanding

15:33.600 --> 15:38.240
shine through in the narrative. Afterward we can go to the newest movies witness the end result of

15:38.240 --> 15:42.880
progressive subversion and notice how all the ethics all the morals all the heroism has been

15:42.880 --> 15:47.280
entirely flipped on its head and how that roughly corresponds with the loss of broader political

15:47.280 --> 15:52.000
knowledge regarding socialism's true nature. But if a progressive were to hear that analysis about

15:52.000 --> 15:56.640
how Star Wars is political I would be labeled a racist bigoted boot-licking chud who is too

15:56.640 --> 16:01.520
stupid to understand politics and I'm taking Star Wars too seriously and don't ask questions

16:01.520 --> 16:06.080
just consume product and then get excited for next products yeah that
