5820	10120	This might come as a surprise to you, but BreadTube doesn't understand economics.
10120	13480	More specifically, for our purposes today, they don't understand the housing crisis.
13480	16440	If you've been paying attention to the housing market right now, prices of homes everywhere
16440	19760	are skyrocketing, rents are up, and poor people are feeling the pinch.
19760	23440	Your favorite BreadTubers and online lefty commentators will tell you that capitalism
23440	27380	is to blame due to its inherently predatory nature, that landlords are parasitic entities
27380	30380	of evil that need to be guillotined, and that the housing market must be abolished
30380	31900	for the good of the working class.
31900	35540	To those of us who actually live in reality, there's certainly a housing bubble that's
35540	36540	inflating right now.
36540	40580	But maybe you and I can talk about it a bit more seriously than the champagne socialists do.
40580	45460	Let's start with PhilosophyTube, who has made some absolutely stupid housing takes before.
45460	48340	Yeah, this clip is gonna be starting off strong, but why not?
48340	53700	Thatcher's criterion for responsibility was owning property, and the problem there is
53700	58260	That is a thing that is mathematically impossible for everyone to do at the same time.
58260	63620	You cannot have a housing market and no homeless people.
63620	67780	Because if everybody has secure housing, you cannot sell them housing.
67780	73860	It is quite stunning how somebody can be this monumentally wrong and be this confident about it.
73860	76660	Demand for housing is not constant over a person's life.
76660	79860	The 18 year old looking for a dorm room, the 20 year old looking for their first apartment
79860	83620	off campus, the transient worker only in the city for a six month contract, the family
83620	87220	man with three kids who needs a yard and some space, and the retiree whose kids have
87220	89540	moved away all have different housing needs.
89540	93700	Moreover, the existence of the market mechanism to determine the value of housing isn't what
93700	95140	causes homelessness.
95140	97280	That is an incredibly one dimensional take.
97280	101100	If you just gave everybody housing through a state program, and then used state force
101100	105300	to ensure that housing couldn't be traded, what you're doing is simply assigning people
105300	108980	hovels at gunpoint, and nobody's going to have the option of living anywhere more in
108980	112540	line with their desires because they still cost labour and materials to make.
112540	115820	Only housing a right does not automatically generate infinite houses.
142540	157620	Let's apply Philosophy Tube's reasoning to other markets.
157620	160900	A capitalist market distributes things to people who can afford to buy them, but this
160900	164100	fact doesn't necessarily mean that some people will be excluded from that market.
164100	166940	If there's enough supply, and everyone can afford the item, then there's no exclusion
166940	167940	at all.
167940	170980	Philosophy Tube is acting like the market mechanism itself is the problem, and it's
170980	171980	not.
171980	174940	There's a market where everybody can afford the product, like say the cracker market.
174940	176780	Let's say you want to buy a box of crackers.
176780	179980	Cracker companies still make profits even though everybody can afford a box of crackers.
179980	184100	Even a homeless man who panhandles and only has a few bucks can buy a box of crackers.
184100	187360	Therefore exclusion from the market is not necessary to generate profits.
187360	191280	That being said, there are some pretty serious differences between crackers and housing,
191280	194980	and I think actually discussing the topic and not just grandstanding like Philosophy
194980	198340	Tube does might allow us to understand something about the housing crisis.
198340	202860	The first difference is that people don't buy crackers to store them away as an investment.
202860	206380	Crackers are a pretty poor unit of exchange, as they decay relatively quick.
206380	210420	There are some foodstuffs that have seen their value increase due to rarity and novelty,
210420	214140	like old crystal Pepsi or MREs or something, but those are exceptions to the rule.
214140	217980	To contrast, housing is often purchased as an investment, with the expectation the owner
217980	221980	will one day get money back, sometimes more, sometimes less, based on the market.
221980	225700	Housing is not a thing that is purchased to be wholly consumed and then taken off the
225700	228980	market as its consumption literally turns it into shit, like crackers.
228980	232740	It's meant to retain at least some value after you're done using it.
232740	236900	While crackers only have value in their use, housing has value as an asset.
236900	240300	The second difference is that crackers are a product of labor and materials, while houses
240300	242460	have another component, land.
242460	246220	Land is always going to be some form of natural monopoly, there's only so much land in any
246220	247220	given area.
247220	250660	When a location is popular to live in, like say a city, there is a fixed amount of land
250660	251660	there.
251660	255300	And unlike other types of property, labor cannot create more supply of land.
255300	259140	Labor can allow a single unit of land to be used by more people simultaneously, like
259140	262640	you build smaller houses or you construct an apartment building or whatever, but labor
262640	264940	cannot create more units of land.
264940	269380	Additionally, land is permanent, sinking coastal properties or expensive reclamation projects
269380	270380	notwithstanding.
270380	273840	This is why you can have two purely identical houses in all respects, where one is valued
273840	277780	significantly more in downtown LA and the other significantly less valued in the middle
277780	278780	of Tennessee.
278780	280380	Compare this with crackers.
280380	283080	Crackers can be continually produced with more labor and materials.
283080	286720	If for some reason, crackers suddenly became really trendy among rich people, companies
286720	290020	would create premium luxury crackers with fancy gold labels that make them feel more
290020	291200	exclusive or whatever.
291200	295440	The cracker market can provide ever increasing quality and quantity of crackers to people
295440	296600	who can afford to pay more.
296600	298380	But you can't do this with land.
298380	302720	The housing crisis is therefore less of a production crisis and more of a land crisis.
302720	307360	The third and biggest difference, in my opinion, is that crackers have functioning market feedback
307360	308760	while houses don't.
308760	312380	Consider that an avid consumer of crackers can buy a box of crackers every day.
312380	315420	Consider that there are many alternatives to crackers available, different brands, different
315420	321200	types of crackers, alternative snack foods like chips or ice cream or fruit, I guess.
321200	324980	Consider that crackers can be created, transported and stored relatively easily.
324980	328260	And consider that it's not too hard to tell a good cracker from a bad cracker, whether
328260	332040	that refers to your own personal taste in the cracker type or if the product is damaged
332040	333580	or rotten or something like that.
333580	337800	In this situation, the market feedback mechanisms of capitalism function very well because consumers
337800	340900	have the opportunity to change where they buy crackers, which crackers they buy and
340900	341900	how much they buy.
342420	344780	And the producers of crackers can respond to the sales data they receive in order to
344780	346180	maximize their business.
346180	349100	This is something that a socialist planned economy can't actually do.
349100	351500	Frederick Hayek described this as the calculation problem.
351500	355140	In a capitalist system, the average consumer doesn't need to be well informed of the
355140	359300	intricacies of the creation and distribution of five competing types of crackers, even
359300	362840	if that information between the five different brands is highly specialized.
362840	366900	Because all of that information shakes out in the price of the crackers, or more specifically,
366900	369320	the price to enjoyment ratio for each consumer.
369480	372040	Maybe you just want the cheapest cracker and you don't care about quality.
372040	373680	Maybe you want the highest quality cracker.
373680	376400	In that case, it's a reasonable bet that the highest priced crackers are the highest
376400	377400	quality.
377400	380800	Or maybe you have some specific taste that leads you to buy a niche product and you actually
380800	382840	prefer it over the more higher priced stuff.
382840	383840	I mean, who knows?
383840	387920	The point is, the pricing of an item serves to tell you information about the items generalized
387920	392040	quality, while the sales numbers of that item serves to tell the manufacturers the wishes
392040	393040	of their customers.
393040	397560	A moneyless communist economy has no way to provide feedback to the manufacturers of goods
397760	400100	and will therefore always be highly inefficient.
400100	403980	Even a market socialist economy will not be able to stimulate genuine competition, as
403980	408300	individuals with local knowledge of local trading practices and markets have no incentive
408300	410320	to share that knowledge with the central planners.
410320	414240	However, even though Hayek's observation of the calculation problem is completely correct,
414240	417300	this doesn't mean that it's functional in every market, and the housing market is
417300	419240	one time where it doesn't work.
419240	420560	Houses are different from crackers.
420560	424140	You may buy a box of crackers a day and then the price to enjoyment ratio will shake out
424140	427900	on its own, but nobody's really buying a house a day unless you're hyper-rich or
427900	428900	something.
428900	429900	The housing market is far more limited.
429900	433940	You're only really comparing highly non-standard products in a specific area that you want
433940	437740	to live, and even then only with the other houses on the market at that time.
437740	441060	Buying a house is complicated, both legally and financially, and a layman will probably
441060	442420	have to employ an agent.
442420	445540	Even standardized housing layouts are going to differ from each other in terms of finishings,
445540	447760	or age, or quality, or location.
447760	451040	Problems with houses are sometimes not easy to discover at the time of purchase, but only
451040	452260	pop up years later.
452260	455300	You cannot know if the experience of living in the house that you're about to buy is
455300	458500	comparable to the experience of living in other houses that are available for sale at
458500	459500	the same time.
459500	463300	In this market it's much harder for an individual on their own to make a rational, informed
463300	467460	decision about their purchase, necessitating housing inspectors, housing insurance, trust
467460	470800	in real estate agents, and if all else fails, government regulation.
470800	475260	The housing market is one area in which natural pricing feedback mechanisms don't function,
475260	477020	and therefore a purely free market wouldn't work.
477020	480900	I know that libertarians and NCAPs don't like to hear this, but sometimes you guys
480900	482700	are just as wrong as the socialists.
482700	485800	But hey, at least they're not wrong like Philosophy Tube is, whose conclusion sounds
485800	486800	a bit like this.
486800	490300	And if it's already canon that people can have their property expropriated for a new
490300	495100	mall, it's surely not that much of a leak to say they could be expropriated so people
495100	497500	could actually live in them?
497500	501180	Only this time the money for that forced buyout would be all the rent that's already been
501180	503020	paid over the whole time the series has been running.
503020	506820	But uh, Niall, if that's the case, then who owns all the properties?
506820	508220	Well that's the awesome bit.
508220	509860	Nobody does.
509860	510860	You know what that means?
510860	515580	The character in the comics has a job that they hate or their boss is an asshole or they
515580	520460	need to take time off of work to care for a relative or paint a painting, write a novel,
520460	523340	go on a protest, join a union, get involved in politics.
523340	524340	They can do it!
524340	526920	They can say, screw you, I don't need your job anymore!
526920	532620	Because I don't need to make rent because there is no more rent.
532620	536800	Some fanfiction writers like to imagine that the state could take over some of housing
536800	541080	market's powers but that's kind of already been explored in an alternate universe run
541080	545280	of the comics set in Russia which remains pretty controversial even among fans.
545280	549800	Although another comic book writer called Hugo Chavez wrote his own spinoff series set
549800	556160	in Venezuela where he used the state to recognize small teams of Venezuelan superheroes called
556160	560900	communes and gave them the power to expropriate and administer property.
560900	564800	That left the communes to do their own thing without the state getting too massive and
564800	570680	bureaucratic but still gave those small teams of superheroes some backup and legal legitimacy
570680	571960	when they needed it.
571960	575500	Yeah, apparently landlords should have their property seized, no profit should ever be
575500	579440	gained from owning houses, and control of housing should be devolved into communes.
579440	583200	This is how you get Soviet era style apartment blocks, with communal kitchens and bathrooms
583200	584280	for each floor.
584280	587840	Because since there's no longer any pricing mechanism at all, the resources used must
587840	592840	be allocated as anti-bourgeois as possible at the expense of things like comfort, security,
592840	595040	functionality, and the consent of those who live there.
595040	598120	This inevitably leads to the same live in the pod mentality we're seeing come out
598120	599120	of LA right now.
599120	602840	The only difference is that the Soviet version comes in 50 different shades of grey instead
602840	604520	of rainbow colored paradoxically.
604520	607640	In Philosophy Tube's system, who decides to build new houses?
607640	610060	Where does labor and materials for those houses come from?
610060	612160	Who owns these houses and what rights do they have?
612160	614160	In the end it can only be the state.
614160	618160	In this regard there's no difference between libertarian and authoritarian leftism.
618160	624160	Those people who call themselves libertarian socialists must by necessity behave like Stalinists,
624160	627480	because those people who build houses still need to be paid, and they still need to receive
627480	631320	feedback from the desires of their customers in order to allocate their resources efficiently.
631320	634560	Without that they end up being forced to build a bunch of shit that nobody really wants and
634560	639360	will go entirely unused, like China's empty cities, unless the state forces people into
639360	641120	them like the Soviet Union did.
641120	644500	Another person who has a pretty awful take on this topic is unlearning economics, which
644500	648140	I found surprising because generally he's pretty insightful, at least for a socialist,
648140	651420	and his criticism of Philosophy Tube hits a few of the same points that mine does.
651420	655260	He released a video titled The Death of Economics 101, where he tackles a number of different
655260	656800	topics, including the housing crisis.
656800	658860	This time the subtopic is rent control.
658860	662180	Rent control is when government regulation artificially lowers the price of rent below
662180	665900	what the market can bear, in an effort to provide low income housing to poor people.
665900	670020	However, in my opinion rent control lowers the quality and the quantity of rents available.
670020	671320	Here's my hunch.
671320	674820	Unlike all products in a free market, supply and demand for rental units eventually reach
674820	675820	an equilibrium.
675820	679540	But because rent control targets a specific type of property and artificially lowers its
679540	683040	price below that equilibrium, we should be able to observe a few effects.
683040	687020	First, new buildings that will be constructed will likely be of a type not subject to that
687020	690920	rent control, and so the supply of non-rent controlled units will rise accordingly.
690920	694200	Secondly, old buildings that are covered by rent control will be converted into other
694200	697680	types of property if it's profitable to do so, lowering the supply of the controlled
697680	698680	units.
698680	700760	Thirdly, there will be cases where it might be better for the landlord to simply destroy
700800	704000	the property or keep it empty, if the rent control is severe enough.
704000	707400	And finally, maintenance on the controlled locations will be less frequent, due to less
707400	711400	resources the landlord has to perform them, leading to a slow decline in quality over
711400	712400	time.
712400	716320	In other words, long term rent control should cause the quality and quantity of rental units
716320	717320	to decrease.
717320	721520	And learning economics as a counterpoint to this, is that the reduction of quantity is
721520	725780	not in the supply of housing, but in the supply of housing specifically used for renting.
725780	731340	The supply and demand for houses should balance, with rents at R-star and quantity at Q-star.
731340	733500	What does rent control do in this situation?
733500	738420	It's represented by the horizontal line RC, which forces rents down.
738420	744020	At this low rental rate, the quantity of houses supplied is lower than the previous equilibrium,
744020	746300	even though more people want to rent.
746300	750540	We have a shortage, and a fall in rented units compared to the free market.
750540	755100	The blanket opposition to rent control that derives from this is hugely overstated.
755100	758980	I would contend that the supply demand model can mislead people into thinking that the
758980	764580	reduction is in housing supply, rather than the number of houses specifically used for
764580	765580	renting.
765580	767600	Maybe I'm an idiot, but I don't see how that's a meaningful difference.
767600	770660	In fact, I think that's the point of the criticism of rent control.
770660	772880	It means that there's less places for people to rent.
772880	776020	Like here, let's assume that you've got a bunch of mid-range houses that private owners
776020	779280	want to rent, but rent control makes it more profitable to sell them.
779280	781220	Suddenly there's a bunch of new houses on the market.
781220	784180	Maybe the extra supply causes the price of these houses to drop a little bit, and maybe
784180	788180	a middle-class family that couldn't afford that house right away can now do so instead
788180	789700	of having to wait another year or two.
789700	792940	That is a good short-term benefit, but the lowest classes, the people who would never
792940	796300	be able to afford that house and must rent it, they suffer because the landlords can
796300	798020	no longer afford to rent it to them.
798020	799180	It's kind of like minimum wage.
799180	802940	It might help some people in the middle, but those at the bottom suffer disproportionately,
802940	806700	as they are priced out of the market due to an external force fixing the variables.
806700	811200	And speaking of minimum wage, Unlearning Economics shows the IGM Chicago polls on rent control,
811200	815000	but he doesn't show the IGM Chicago polls during his minimum wage part of this video,
815000	819120	which would have massively weakened his minimum wage arguments, but that's for another time.
819120	822600	Next up, Unlearning Economics brings up an article about how rent control ruined the
822600	823960	Berlin rental economy.
823960	828280	A paper on the phenomenon, unfortunately only available in German, shows that rents for
828280	831380	the controlled locations plummeted, as is to be expected.
831380	834220	But there's no discussion on whether or not these were rental units held by people who
834220	835400	actually needed that relief.
835400	838700	For example, a person making six figures while living in a hole on a wall with five other
838700	842700	guys for a year so he can save up money and launch a startup or buy a house or something.
842700	845800	He certainly doesn't need the relief of rent control, but a poor family with no other option
845800	848420	but to live in that location might actually need that help.
848420	852600	But also, rent controlled apartments ended up being worth less in sale value, and as
852600	856940	expected, the value and rents of their uncontrolled counterparts skyrocketed.
856940	861500	The supply of controlled units dropped by 50%, while the supply of uncontrolled units
861500	864100	shot up disproportionately over 100%.
864100	867620	And Unlearning Economics's response is to say that these things are good, and that the
867620	869960	article he's reading is just crap?
869960	874300	As you're all now budding natural experiment enthusiasts, I know what you're going to ask.
874300	878740	Is there any more credible evidence than this crap on rent control?
878740	880520	This isn't a reply, man.
880520	885020	Rent control seems to have some short-term good effects for some slice of the population,
885020	888740	but it also seems to have long-term bad effects for everybody except the ultra-rich.
888740	892620	Unlearning Economics then talks about a study conducted on rent control in San Francisco
892620	897180	in 1994, where a recent city policy saw that old units were rent controlled, while newly
897180	898460	built units were not.
898460	903180	He says that this paper claims the policy led to a 15% reduction in total rental units
903180	904180	available.
904180	910180	What the paper actually claims, what he presents on screen in his own video, is that 7.2% of
910180	914620	rent controlled properties underwent renovations to evade rent control but still remained on
914620	920020	the market as non-rent controlled units, while 8.1% of rent controlled units were sold to
920020	923540	owner-occupants, meaning the new owner decided to live in the property themselves rather
923540	925660	than rent it out, taking it off the rental market.
925660	928060	The paper's abstract restates these effects as well.
928060	930380	Rent control limited renters' mobility by 20%.
930380	935020	15% of rent controlled units were either sold to people intending to live in them directly
935020	939740	or redeveloped by landlords to become non-controlled units but still available for rent.
939740	943300	And while rent control prevents displacement of renters in the short-term, long-term it
943300	946260	drove rent prices up across the entire market.
946260	955300	He also says that a specific graph from this paper shows rents fell, but look at it.
955300	959780	It says renters, not rents, people renting, not price of renting.
959780	963860	The number of people renting a rent controlled unit fell at the same rate as rent controlled
963860	967980	units were sold or converted into higher priced, non-rent controlled counterparts.
967980	971180	In other words, those landlords who either found it more profitable to renovate or sell
971180	975000	the property or could no longer afford to keep renting at the new controlled rate had
975000	977980	a higher chance of just folding and so the tenant suffered.
977980	981860	Paying a rent that's bankrupting you is certainly bad, but being entirely priced out
981860	983240	of the market is worse.
983240	986840	The problem isn't necessarily that inequality is bad, after all we all know that inequality
986840	989660	is required for innovation or production to actually happen.
989660	994120	The problem is that extreme inequality has a snowballing effect into other areas of society,
994120	997380	and that rent control is a force that exacerbates those other effects.
997380	1001200	The paper suggests that one of these knock-on effects is that middle class people are less
1001200	1003760	and less likely to move into a rent controlled area.
1003760	1007540	It turns out that a rent controlled neighborhood ends up containing only homeless people until
1007540	1011400	they migrate away or get arrested or something, those few middle class people who did actually
1011400	1014060	snag a good housing deal and the ultra wealthy.
1014060	1018240	And if the majority of an area is wealthy, the other non-housing amenities in that area
1018240	1019840	will also see their prices rise.
1019840	1024400	In other words, the demand for high priced, high quality goods from upscale stores will
1024400	1028760	outpace the demand for low priced, low quality goods sold at Walmart or Dollar Tree, and
1028760	1031880	eventually those people living in rent controlled housing will only be able to afford their
1031880	1034240	rent and nothing else in their area.
1034240	1038860	In essence, if some suburb or sub-community is a highly priced bubble, with its internal
1038860	1043900	economy being quite expensive, a rent control law does serve to increase lower class access
1043900	1044900	to that location.
1044900	1048400	But the long term effects of this is that those people who gained access will rapidly
1048400	1051940	find themselves priced out of not only their own neighborhoods, but surrounding neighborhoods
1051940	1056260	as well, because this sort of unearned access has knock-on effects in the larger economy.
1056260	1061320	The 1994 San Francisco paper ends by stating that rent control has contributed to gentrification
1061320	1065220	by simultaneously bringing in higher income residents while preventing the displacement
1065220	1066220	of minorities.
1066220	1069060	And here's how Unlearning Economics replies to this.
1069060	1073060	Keeping existing residents in the area while rich residents join is a bad thing.
1073060	1076980	The solution is obviously to have only rich residents so the income inequality in the
1076980	1077980	area is low.
1077980	1081260	In his defence, it's hard to see this effect as it's not always visible.
1081260	1083060	But a big problem with rent control is what I mentioned earlier.
1083060	1086380	There will always be people who would move into the community and contribute to it, but
1086380	1090060	now do not because rent controlled units are over consumed due to the lower price and the
1090060	1093020	additional housing stock being created will be overpriced for them.
1093020	1096220	The supply goes down, costs go up, and now you've got an entire class of people who
1096220	1100260	aren't moving in while rich people can still afford the area, increasing the inequality
1100260	1101900	you're aiming to fight with your regulation.
1101900	1104420	Unlearning Economics ends his talk like this.
1104420	1108880	So it's bad when existing tenants stay but also bad when they leave?
1108880	1110740	Gentrification is good but also bad?
1110740	1114560	I found this paper quite confusing, and it seems to be a go-to reference for opponents
1114560	1115740	of rent control.
1115740	1119700	With such a variety of competing effects, the authors eventually conclude that the overall
1119700	1122060	effects of rent control are a wash.
1122060	1123340	And he's just lying to you.
1123340	1126260	The paper does not state the effects of rent control are a wash.
1126260	1129860	Instead, the paper states that the beneficiaries of rent control are more likely to remain
1129860	1133200	at their current location because they're getting a good deal, that rent control disproportionately
1133200	1136380	helps minorities as well as people who have a longer history at their current location,
1136380	1140380	and that on the flip side, non-controlled areas saw people cycling through their rental
1140380	1143460	units faster, as both landlords and tenants try to get better deals.
1143460	1147580	They also found that landlords avoid rent control by converting rental units to condos
1147580	1149700	or by renovating the building to avoid regulation.
1149700	1153900	The reduction in low-cost rent supply, as well as the new availability of high-cost
1153900	1158240	rent supply, or condos and houses for sale, ultimately created a housing market geared
1158240	1161020	more towards higher-income individuals in the long term.
1161020	1163660	This is not a wash, this is a failure of the policy.
1163660	1167400	The last video we'll talk about today is Hassan's, and his is probably the funniest
1167400	1171060	of all, because to be honest Hassan is a joke, it's 30 minutes of him whining about not
1171060	1172060	being able to buy a house.
1172060	1175920	The video title is correct, but he brings to the table a simple explanation for all
1175920	1178380	of these things, filtered through his own political lens.
1178380	1180620	I hope he actually paid the editor of this video this time.
1208380	1231340	Hassan doesn't understand that the value of a house is largely dependent on the value
1231340	1233220	of other houses in the same area on the market.
1233220	1237160	This is a complex formulation that takes into account location, house quality, willingness
1237160	1240680	to sell, but it's not nearly as simple as Hassan makes it out to be.
1240680	1243920	Like if there's 10 comparable houses on the same street, and they all get listed,
1243920	1247280	and the first one goes for way over asking price, the others probably will too.
1297160	1315760	It's really funny listening to Hassan complain about these numbers, knowing how much he makes,
1315760	1317080	this is not a problem for him.
1317080	1319960	This is what breadtubers do when they try their hand in economic analysis, you know.
1319960	1323680	They shit all over one side of an economic transaction, and ignore the other side because
1323680	1324680	that's all they're interested in.
1324680	1328060	Right now people selling their homes are making a killing, they're doing very well, but people
1328060	1331120	like Hassan only care about the buyers of homes that are getting fucked over.
1331120	1334720	Meanwhile when it comes to the buyers of labour right now, they're having to jack up wages
1334720	1337360	because no one wants to actually work for minimum wage during this climate, and these
1337360	1341380	same breadtubers complaining about the difficulty of buying homes are laughing at the difficulty
1341380	1344680	of buying labour, simply because it suits their politics and the targets are acceptable
1344680	1345680	to them.
1345680	1349280	The actual truth is, both of these things can be negative if pushed too far.
1349280	1352400	Upward pressure on wages can certainly be a bad thing, you know, probably not yet, but
1352400	1355880	if it was like $50 an hour for a burger flipper job or something, absolutely.
1355880	1356880	Same with housing.
1356880	1360240	But Hassan only cares about the buyer's side of the housing equation, just like he only
1360240	1363320	cares about the seller's side of the labour equation, because he doesn't actually care
1363320	1368120	about the damage done by his idealized policies, he only cares if the correct people are hurt
1369120	1372400	The house itself is a depreciating asset.
1372400	1377420	The land, on the other hand, is an appreciating asset, especially when you're purchasing land
1377420	1381640	in like fucking Los Angeles, in like a really good area of Los Angeles.
1381640	1385640	I don't know why Hassan thinks houses are depreciating assets, they're not quite like
1385640	1386640	cars, you know.
1386640	1389560	Yeah there's maintenance, but houses can absolutely appreciate over time depending on the market.
1389560	1395380	Like hedge funds are straight up purchasing as much, as many houses as they fucking can,
1395380	1399140	so that they can turn around and start renting it to people, so they can become landlords.
1399140	1405520	Which ironically creates a system where buying a house is unaffordable for most average Joe's,
1405520	1408160	so they are stuck renting forever.
1408160	1414900	So it is a problem that basically creates another opportunity for, you know, these hedge
1414900	1417980	funds to make more money.
1417980	1422380	It's not just fucking hedge funds buying up all the houses and renting them to people.
1422380	1423900	This is like a child's take on housing.
1423900	1426780	And that's not to say it's not happening in some places, it certainly is a little bit.
1426780	1430100	You've got a massive crash during COVID, the value of everybody's property went down, businesses
1430100	1433780	closed up, etc, etc, and the people who made a killing are the ones who vacuumed up property
1433780	1436980	when they were at COVID lows, because that property value will inevitably bounce back.
1436980	1438340	That's not the only variable here.
1438340	1441740	What's also happening is, now that lockdowns are coming to a close in a lot of places,
1441740	1444860	you've got tons of people moving, whether that be out of cities or back closer to work
1444860	1448460	as work at home ends, you've got a historically low interest rate on mortgages, you've got
1448460	1452060	many potential sellers shelving their plans due to uncertainty, you've got many potential
1452060	1455540	buyers who have reduced their incidental spending due to lockdowns while working at home and
1455540	1458420	saving money or taking pay raises for outside essential work.
1458420	1462280	This has all resulted with more buyers having more money and less sellers willing to sell.
1462280	1466040	It's not just opportunistic rich people monopolistically buying everything.
1466040	1472820	It might sound cool when your dad makes, you know, 100,000 above asking price on his fucking
1472820	1476660	house, but it's not going to be so great when he can't find another house to purchase.
1476660	1481020	And that's the reality when people are leaving California, they're not leaving California
1481020	1482020	because of taxes.
1482020	1483580	That's a lie.
1483580	1487860	It's poor people leaving California because they can't afford to live in California, so
1487860	1489620	they fucking go somewhere else.
1489620	1494140	They simply cannot afford to rent or even purchase a home.
1494140	1496260	Here's one thing that sounds actually correct about it's not about taxes.
1496260	1498940	It might be for corporations, it might be for business owners, people who can work from
1498940	1501300	literally anywhere, but it's not for the average person.
1501300	1504620	Average people don't make nearly as many decisions based on taxes as we think they do.
1504620	1507660	It's highly unlikely that you'll choose a job or a place to live based on the marginal
1507660	1509980	tax rate of the area in most situations.
1509980	1513220	It's okay if people are priced out of some market, Sasan.
1513220	1515300	Not everybody has to live in California.
1515300	1518420	Stop looking down on what you coastal elites call flyover states.
1518420	1521380	That dude who called you a snob in your own chat and you got insulted by it?
1521380	1523140	You just fucking proved him right.
1523140	1526620	Motherfuckers that are finally able to afford a home because they have like an amount of
1526620	1531540	capital that they've accrued over the course of the fucking pandemic are so fucked when
1531540	1536540	basically they're not able to refinance, when basically they realize that the investment
1536540	1541980	property that they purchased and now that they're stuck with is not going to hold its
1541980	1547100	value, especially if they fucking bought it in some random area that is not slated to
1547100	1551860	appreciate to the goddamn moon like you would in certain parts of California, like in fucking
1551860	1552860	Los Angeles.
1552860	1553860	And then they're fucked.
1553860	1557660	And even if they are able to refinance at that point, the interest rates are going to
1557660	1558660	be higher.
1558660	1564860	So no matter what their refinance works, now they have a property that's value is lower
1564860	1566660	that you're absolutely stuck with.
1566660	1570260	Didn't you just say that hedge funds are buying up everything and making a killing
1570260	1572420	and renting it all out to people and turning us all into serfs?
1572420	1575700	But now people who buy homes are fucked because they won't be valuable?
1575700	1577740	Would that also affect the hedge funds?
1577740	1580740	You can really tell when somebody is making an analysis based on ideology and not on the
1580740	1581740	facts.
1581740	1585580	I'm still so mad that like I lost the dream house that I literally found.
1585580	1588380	It was like the second house I went to and it was my dream house.
1588380	1593240	It was still of course expensive, obviously above like what the market rate would be for
1593240	1594240	something like that.
1594240	1598300	But it was affordable in comparison to like all these other fucking places I've seen.
1598300	1599300	And I lost it.
1599300	1600300	And it fucking sucks.
1600300	1602220	I was going to have a pool boys.
1602220	1603220	It's the second.
1603220	1604220	Okay, dude.
1604220	1605220	Listen, it'll be fine.
1605220	1606300	It's not your it's not your dream house.
1606300	1607940	I'm sure there are other fish in the sea.
1607940	1611480	This is definitely like a first time home buyers story, isn't it?
1611480	1615160	It was my dream house, dude, your Hassan.
1615160	1616160	Just just buy it.
1616160	1617160	You have the money.
1617160	1618160	Pay for it.
1618160	1622720	Like this is a rich guy coming into a poor neighborhood, talking to a poor homeowner
1622720	1626440	complaining that he sold his house to another guy who's also poor, just pay the fucking
1626440	1627440	price dude.
1627440	1629320	Hassan is so angry.
1629320	1631120	He couldn't fuck a dude out of his house.
1631120	1632520	Like what is his solution here?
1632520	1635440	Should he have been able to force the seller to sell him that at the lower price?
1635440	1636440	Like what does he want?
1636440	1644600	Sold for 78% over asking, it was listed at $1 million, it's over 2.12, a three bedroom
1644600	1647920	three bathroom in fucking Mount Washington.
1647920	1650520	It's actually kind of cool though.
1650520	1651520	Holy shit.
1651520	1654200	Hassan is looking at one of the richest areas in the world.
1654200	1658720	Are you seriously talking like these, these secluded stately mansions are somehow relevant
1658720	1660320	to the wider housing market?
1660320	1664640	Are you actually complaining that you can't pay like 300, $500 a month or something and
1664640	1667320	live in some woodland compound?
1667320	1670480	Is the US running out of houses?
1670480	1674360	The housing shortage conversation is kind of bullshit.
1674360	1675360	And here's why.
1675360	1680080	There are so many vacant fucking properties, dude.
1680080	1683760	There are so many vacant properties.
1683760	1686680	It actually is because inventory is historically low.
1686680	1688780	That is the main driver of the situation.
1688780	1691920	We are at the lowest point in history for housing availability.
1691920	1694380	Anna Kasparian had a shit take about this subject recently.
1694380	1699160	She tweeted, America is short of homes as a strange focus when foreign capital and private
1699160	1702680	equity funds are snatching up all available housing for their portfolios.
1702680	1706000	I'm sick of hearing about the shortage of housing as homes owned by people who don't
1706000	1707640	even live in the US sit empty.
1707640	1711560	And that does happen sometimes, but the problem with this point of view that rich people are
1711560	1715380	buying homes and keeping them vacant and that's the driver of the housing crisis and therefore
1715380	1719280	we shouldn't have to worry about building new homes is that it's ultimately a counterproductive
1719280	1720280	view.
1720280	1723180	One, most vacancies aren't where people want to live.
1723180	1726480	The highest vacancy rates in the United States are in low demand places.
1726480	1729680	Of course, the lowest vacancy rates are on the West Coast and in the Northeast.
1729680	1732880	Telling somebody in the Bay Area that there's an abandoned house in Detroit they can move
1732880	1735320	to isn't really a solution to their problem.
1735320	1737680	Two, vacancies aren't all the same.
1737680	1742580	Census data shows us that 50% of all vacancies are called market vacancies, which is a term
1742580	1746480	describing the inevitable gaps in tenancy that can occur when a lease ends.
1746480	1749960	Sometimes there's trouble finding new tenants, sometimes a deal falls through last minute,
1749960	1751960	sometimes there's repairs to be done, whatever.
1751960	1755040	Landlords lose money when a home is vacant and they're already incentivized by the market
1755040	1757720	for these market vacancies to be as short as possible.
1757720	1762220	Three, landlords love low vacancy rates because it gives them much more market power.
1762220	1765140	If somebody shows up in their neighborhood and builds a bunch of new rental units, the
1765140	1769200	vacancy rate goes up, competition goes up, rents go down, and the power of currently
1769200	1771900	existing landlords over the market goes down as well.
1771900	1775940	Not building new units strengthens the position of those currently existing landlords, while
1775940	1779420	building more homes opens the market to further competition pressure.
1779420	1782980	Four, a vacancy rate of zero is disastrous.
1782980	1785700	You would not be able to ever move into a new location because there would be no available
1785700	1786700	locations at all.
1786700	1787700	Kids moving to their own place?
1787700	1789220	Nope, they got to stay at home.
1789220	1790220	Immigrants?
1790220	1791220	Nowhere for them to go.
1791220	1795020	Low vacancies means that if you want to move, you have to trade houses with somebody else,
1795020	1798880	while the existence of at least some vacancies allows for market fluidity.
1798880	1802400	The problem with the current housing crisis is there's no easy solution.
1802400	1806660	All the dumb shit that breadtubers say equate to entitled whining that just makes things
1806660	1808340	far worse than they already are.
1808340	1811840	But because land is a constant rather than a variable means that we will always have
1811840	1814220	this problem in the most costly cities on earth.
1814220	1818580	No matter what, not everybody can live in downtown LA or on Manhattan Island, and that's
1818580	1819580	that.
1819580	1820580	There's just not enough space.
1820580	1821580	But that's okay.
1821580	1824020	It's okay if people are priced out of certain locations.
1824020	1827660	Not everybody has to live in a megacity, and forcing yourself into a tin can to stay in
1827660	1829820	Southern California isn't really good for you.
1829820	1832900	Driving on the highway to and from your job every day, cramped in your car, breathing
1832900	1836180	in the city's smog because you want to live in the place to be, is probably the biggest,
1836180	1837820	most dumb fuck way you can waste your life.
1837820	1840020	Let's say you work for ten years, commuting two hours a day.
1840020	1843360	You're going to end up in your thirties with chronic and curable back pain, a lot less
1843360	1846900	money than you should have, and if you properly used that time you wasted in your car, you
1846900	1849820	could have become masterclass at some skill or hobby.
1849820	1852780	I have the right to live in LA, shut up, no you don't.
1852780	1855700	Millennials and Zoomers have this feeling that Metropolis is the only place you should
1855700	1859800	aspire to end up, that hometowns are places to be moved on from and be embarrassed by,
1859800	1863300	and they're rapidly discovering that even though the city has its amenities, it doesn't
1863300	1864300	have community.
1864300	1867060	I think this is why progs throw around the community as a label so much, they don't
1867060	1868480	actually fucking know what it means.
1868480	1873060	My generation spent so much time considering their small town origins as a waiting room,
1873060	1876760	feeling some indescribable pull towards the rootlessness of city life, and its revolving
1876760	1880960	door of new people, new experiences, and new locations, that a lot of millennials who
1880960	1885320	are now in their thirties are finding themselves lonely and not actually able to understand
1885320	1886320	why.
1886320	1887320	But here's why.
1887320	1890760	The transient nature of that lifestyle, the in-betweenness that's so appealing, ultimately
1890760	1892520	leaves you with nothing solid to stand on.
1892520	1894920	I can't find the article at the time of writing this script, I'm sure I'll be able to put
1894920	1898400	it on the screen and post, about a journalist who is having a farewell get together at the
1898400	1903120	bar for a colleague who was moving to Hong Kong for a new job back in early 2020.
1903120	1905920	I'm sure that probably turned out not to be a good career move, actually.
1905920	1910460	But the point is, among the transients, the in-betweens, there's no sense of community.
1910460	1911640	There's no neighborhood.
1911640	1914420	There's no family you get to know next door as your kids grow up together.
1914420	1918020	You've got your work colleagues, whom you only talk to about work, and whom you only
1918020	1919520	get along with when you're drinking.
1919520	1922760	And there's no guarantee that connection will remain when they suddenly fly off, leaving
1922760	1923760	nothing behind.
1923760	1926400	They don't really care about you, and you don't really care about them.
1926400	1928680	Your life path simply happened to align for a little while.
1928680	1930720	It doesn't have to be this way.
1930720	1932800	Even living in a city, it doesn't have to be this way.
1932800	1935640	But there's certainly something about a specific type of city living that makes people
1935640	1939160	think that they're disposable and treat others as if they were disposable in return.
1939160	1942720	It's no surprise to me that millennials and zoomers are having trouble forming lasting
1942720	1943720	relationships.
1943720	1946440	I'm not saying that everybody has to return to tradition and live in the same house they
1946440	1950080	grew up in, or farm on some homestead with five acres or whatever.
1950080	1953260	You can live in some suburb half an hour outside of downtown and maintain a sense of community
1953260	1954260	just fine.
1954260	1958260	I'm saying that embracing a lifestyle that prioritizes novelty over connection, that
1958260	1961960	values width over depth, will ultimately make you unhappy.
1962160	1964960	And that lifestyle is uniquely incentivized by city living.
1964960	1968360	These are people who think that their real life will finally start once they move, ignoring
1968360	1972240	the fact that their life is already passing them by right now as they wait, failing to
1972240	1976000	realize that even if they manage to do more, they're still the same person with the same
1976000	1977000	baggage.
1977000	1980000	This is just armchair psychology for me, but I think the reason they do it is because they
1980000	1981000	have big dreams.
1981000	1984880	And rather than knuckling down and doing the work right now, it's easy to keep the looming
1984880	1987920	failure at arm's length by saying that they have to move to the big city before they can
1987920	1988980	really get going.
1988980	1991360	Or if they're already in the big city, they have to move to the next spot.
1991760	1995640	A lot of people have been messaging me recently about Georgism as a solution to the land problem.
1995640	1999620	A philosophy created by Henry George, Georgism is the belief that people should own the value
1999620	2002600	they produce themselves, both in labor and in trade.
2002600	2006240	Meaning no income taxes, no trade taxes, no purchase taxes.
2006240	2010520	But that because land will always be some level of natural monopoly, the economic value
2010520	2014240	derived from the land itself and its natural resources should be taxed.
2014240	2017880	In other words, if you own a business and generate profit, it shouldn't be taxed.
2017880	2019480	If you build a house, that shouldn't be taxed.
2019700	2023520	But the land your business or house sits on should be taxed, as should any resources you
2023520	2026160	pull from the natural world, like water or minerals.
2026160	2029440	The logic is you may have created your house or your business, either directly with your
2029440	2032800	labor or indirectly by working elsewhere and then paying for it, but you didn't create
2032800	2034400	the land or its resources.
2034400	2035840	That was provided by nature.
2035840	2040120	It holds its value because of society and therefore a land tax rather than a capital
2040120	2042700	or labor tax should be what funds the government.
2042700	2046840	Many economists since the days of Adam Smith have noted that unlike all other forms of
2046840	2051000	taxation, a land tax doesn't create economic inefficiency like the minimum wage or generate
2051000	2052840	holes in the market like rent control.
2052840	2055080	And modern experiments seem to bear this out.
2055080	2059360	Queensland, Australia ran a land tax experiment and the results seem to show that it had little
2059360	2063300	effect on the price of housing, but it did increase the total number of houses for sale.
2063300	2067940	The land tax was seen by Karl Marx as a method that would alleviate the working class's woes,
2067940	2071320	but ultimately rejected it as it would prevent a transition to a socialist economy.
2071320	2076260	At the same time, Milton Friedman described the land tax as the least bad tax since it
2076260	2080300	only targets what individuals did not create with their labor and it imposes little burden
2080300	2081500	on economic activity.
2081500	2085340	If you can get these two guys to begrudgingly agree that the idea is a good one and the
2085340	2089100	only reason they don't like it is because it doesn't square away with their pet projects,
2089100	2090980	you've probably got something special on your hands.
2090980	2092500	To be honest, I don't know how I feel about Georgism.
2092500	2095740	I had to begin reading up on it specifically for this video and my opinion isn't fully
2095740	2096740	formed yet.
2096740	2098100	At face value, it seems alright.
2098100	2101540	I know something that's commonly advocated for nowadays is a use tax, meaning that if
2101540	2104240	you own property but you're just sitting on it and not putting it to use, you should
2104240	2105240	be taxed for it.
2105240	2108600	Considering the current problem in Vancouver, for example, where Chinese nationals want
2108600	2112580	to hide money from the Chinese Communist Party and do so by buying Canadian homes and then
2112580	2115440	simply letting them sit around empty because they don't want to go through the hassle
2115440	2118940	of renting them to people, I can see why this sort of use tax is becoming appealing.
2118940	2122880	But as long as there's an impetus to own your own property, this will always be a problem.
2122880	2126120	And no, the solution isn't to tell people that they'll own nothing and be happy or
2126120	2128320	to live in the pod and eat the bugs and rent forever.
2128320	2132640	A society with strong self-defense rights, the reason America has the second amendment
2132640	2135800	in the first place, it all sits atop of property ownership.
2135800	2139800	If you're a serf working for a lord or alternatively living in an Amazon wage cage, you don't
2139800	2142680	give a shit about the property because it's not your property and its defense falls not
2142680	2143880	to you but to its owners.
2143880	2147580	But that house, that homestead, that business, it's yours.
2147580	2152080	On the emotional side of things, there's a certain pride in being able to stand on
2152080	2156440	your own two feet and say, no matter what good or bad comes my way, this is my place
2156440	2157440	and I'm responsible for it.
2157440	2161920	On the practical side, a society that has no self-defense rights is one that must rely
2161920	2164280	on heavy state involvement for defense.
2164280	2168800	This is costly, inefficient, and often tyrannical towards those people who are being defended.
2168800	2172080	A property owner is incentivized to protect their property with their weapons.
2172080	2177000	It doesn't matter how much a dumbfuck Marxist says, under no circumstances, if property
2177000	2179840	rights go, self-defense rights go right along with it.
2179840	2183080	If you want a further exploration of this idea, I would recommend Krauts video on the
2183080	2187720	origins of American gun culture and its sequel, the discussion of the Mexican-American border.
2187720	2191280	And just because the ideal is to ultimately move away from the rent-away-your-whole-life
2191280	2196200	model and get some skin in the property game, this doesn't make landlords evil.
2196200	2197980	Landlords do indeed provide a service.
2197980	2201120	They bear the burden of the legal red tape of property ownership.
2201120	2203960	They're responsible for repairs and upkeep, not you.
2203960	2206120	And that is what you rent in exchange.
2206120	2209640	Simply living in a place doesn't mean that you should own it, regardless of what breadtubers
2209640	2210640	might say.
2210640	2214840	In fact, I guarantee you every single popular breadtuber out there makes way more than their
2214840	2215880	landlords do.
2215880	2219960	Which is why philosophy tubes call for a rent strike, even as that channel's Patreon income
2219960	2222460	is set to private, is all the more onerous.
2222460	2223640	But I've done a video on that already.
2223640	2224640	You know what?
2224640	2227600	To be honest, it must suck if you're a breadtube fanboy.
2227600	2230200	Breadtube doesn't really care about black people outside of what BLM can do for them.
2230200	2232800	They don't really care about trans people outside of what the trans activists can do
2232800	2233800	for them.
2233800	2236440	They're cool with women and femboys because they can be sexual predators, I guess.
2236440	2239240	The only thing remaining that the breadtuber can actually talk about is class conflict
2239240	2240340	and material conditions.
2240340	2244020	And their content on these topics isn't rooted in any sort of knowledge, wisdom, or evidence,
2244020	2246780	but instead in a broad feeling that people are suffering and something must be done to
2246780	2247780	help them.
2247780	2250860	That's not nothing, but it's not enough to build an entire philosophy around.
2250860	2254140	It's gotta suck to throw away all that wokeness and redefined intersectionality to
2254140	2257780	be radlib shit and not real leftism because it's all about being a part of the dirtbag
2257780	2261220	left right now, and then have the only thing that you can really fall back on is a complete
2261220	2264020	lack of economic knowledge, stemming from the fact that the only actual studying of
2264020	2267700	the topic that Breadtube does is reading Twitter trending tags about Marxist analysis, which
2267700	2270500	is already rapidly becoming outdated back when it was being written.
2270500	2275280	I'd like to thank not only The Three Stooges, whose content I've reviewed for this video,
2275280	2280040	but also Anna Kasparian for being Cenk's token Armenian, and Sargon, Vee, Destiny,
2280040	2282960	and Kraut for some of the resources I used in my own analysis.
2282960	2286260	And of course, I'd like to thank everybody who supports me on Patreon or Subscribestar,
2286260	2289300	to everybody who's a member on YouTube or a sub on Twitch, thank you very much for keeping
2289300	2290300	this content flowing.
2290300	2294360	Here's the scoop guys, tomorrow, June 8th, is my birthday, and that 100,000 YouTube sub
2294360	2296720	mark would be an excellent milestone for that day, wouldn't it?
2296720	2299340	Please consider spreading my channel and this video around to your friends, it would be
2299340	2300340	highly appreciated.
2300340	2304840	I would also like to announce that on my gaming channel over on Twitch, twitch.tv slash gameboomers,
2304840	2308880	I intend to start doing a series of E3 streams over the coming week, the schedule for which
2308880	2310180	is currently on screen.
2310180	2313080	Please consider dropping in and watching the conferences and announcements with me, as
2313080	2315580	I guarantee it will be a hilarious trainwreck.
2315580	2319960	I will continue to try and work on SFO videos during my downtime, but please be patient,
2319960	2323480	as during E3 every year, I make gameboomers my first priority.
2323480	2325160	And you know what, that's actually starting to pay off.
2325160	2327780	I am just a hair away from making Twitch partner.
2327780	2331260	So as I mentioned, please consider supporting me over there and spreading those streams
2331260	2332260	around too.
2332260	2333260	Alright, I'll see you later.
2333260	2333760	I love you.
