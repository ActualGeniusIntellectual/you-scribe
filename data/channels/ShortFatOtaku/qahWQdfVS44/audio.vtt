00:00.000 --> 00:05.820
10.

00:05.820 --> 00:10.120
This might come as a surprise to you, but BreadTube doesn't understand economics.

00:10.120 --> 00:13.480
More specifically, for our purposes today, they don't understand the housing crisis.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.440
If you've been paying attention to the housing market right now, prices of homes everywhere

00:16.440 --> 00:19.760
are skyrocketing, rents are up, and poor people are feeling the pinch.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.440
Your favorite BreadTubers and online lefty commentators will tell you that capitalism

00:23.440 --> 00:27.380
is to blame due to its inherently predatory nature, that landlords are parasitic entities

00:27.380 --> 00:30.380
of evil that need to be guillotined, and that the housing market must be abolished

00:30.380 --> 00:31.900
for the good of the working class.

00:31.900 --> 00:35.540
To those of us who actually live in reality, there's certainly a housing bubble that's

00:35.540 --> 00:36.540
inflating right now.

00:36.540 --> 00:40.580
But maybe you and I can talk about it a bit more seriously than the champagne socialists do.

00:40.580 --> 00:45.460
Let's start with PhilosophyTube, who has made some absolutely stupid housing takes before.

00:45.460 --> 00:48.340
Yeah, this clip is gonna be starting off strong, but why not?

00:48.340 --> 00:53.700
Thatcher's criterion for responsibility was owning property, and the problem there is

00:53.700 --> 00:58.260
That is a thing that is mathematically impossible for everyone to do at the same time.

00:58.260 --> 01:03.620
You cannot have a housing market and no homeless people.

01:03.620 --> 01:07.780
Because if everybody has secure housing, you cannot sell them housing.

01:07.780 --> 01:13.860
It is quite stunning how somebody can be this monumentally wrong and be this confident about it.

01:13.860 --> 01:16.660
Demand for housing is not constant over a person's life.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.860
The 18 year old looking for a dorm room, the 20 year old looking for their first apartment

01:19.860 --> 01:23.620
off campus, the transient worker only in the city for a six month contract, the family

01:23.620 --> 01:27.220
man with three kids who needs a yard and some space, and the retiree whose kids have

01:27.220 --> 01:29.540
moved away all have different housing needs.

01:29.540 --> 01:33.700
Moreover, the existence of the market mechanism to determine the value of housing isn't what

01:33.700 --> 01:35.140
causes homelessness.

01:35.140 --> 01:37.280
That is an incredibly one dimensional take.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.100
If you just gave everybody housing through a state program, and then used state force

01:41.100 --> 01:45.300
to ensure that housing couldn't be traded, what you're doing is simply assigning people

01:45.300 --> 01:48.980
hovels at gunpoint, and nobody's going to have the option of living anywhere more in

01:48.980 --> 01:52.540
line with their desires because they still cost labour and materials to make.

01:52.540 --> 01:55.820
Only housing a right does not automatically generate infinite houses.

02:22.540 --> 02:37.620
Let's apply Philosophy Tube's reasoning to other markets.

02:37.620 --> 02:40.900
A capitalist market distributes things to people who can afford to buy them, but this

02:40.900 --> 02:44.100
fact doesn't necessarily mean that some people will be excluded from that market.

02:44.100 --> 02:46.940
If there's enough supply, and everyone can afford the item, then there's no exclusion

02:46.940 --> 02:47.940
at all.

02:47.940 --> 02:50.980
Philosophy Tube is acting like the market mechanism itself is the problem, and it's

02:50.980 --> 02:51.980
not.

02:51.980 --> 02:54.940
There's a market where everybody can afford the product, like say the cracker market.

02:54.940 --> 02:56.780
Let's say you want to buy a box of crackers.

02:56.780 --> 02:59.980
Cracker companies still make profits even though everybody can afford a box of crackers.

02:59.980 --> 03:04.100
Even a homeless man who panhandles and only has a few bucks can buy a box of crackers.

03:04.100 --> 03:07.360
Therefore exclusion from the market is not necessary to generate profits.

03:07.360 --> 03:11.280
That being said, there are some pretty serious differences between crackers and housing,

03:11.280 --> 03:14.980
and I think actually discussing the topic and not just grandstanding like Philosophy

03:14.980 --> 03:18.340
Tube does might allow us to understand something about the housing crisis.

03:18.340 --> 03:22.860
The first difference is that people don't buy crackers to store them away as an investment.

03:22.860 --> 03:26.380
Crackers are a pretty poor unit of exchange, as they decay relatively quick.

03:26.380 --> 03:30.420
There are some foodstuffs that have seen their value increase due to rarity and novelty,

03:30.420 --> 03:34.140
like old crystal Pepsi or MREs or something, but those are exceptions to the rule.

03:34.140 --> 03:37.980
To contrast, housing is often purchased as an investment, with the expectation the owner

03:37.980 --> 03:41.980
will one day get money back, sometimes more, sometimes less, based on the market.

03:41.980 --> 03:45.700
Housing is not a thing that is purchased to be wholly consumed and then taken off the

03:45.700 --> 03:48.980
market as its consumption literally turns it into shit, like crackers.

03:48.980 --> 03:52.740
It's meant to retain at least some value after you're done using it.

03:52.740 --> 03:56.900
While crackers only have value in their use, housing has value as an asset.

03:56.900 --> 04:00.300
The second difference is that crackers are a product of labor and materials, while houses

04:00.300 --> 04:02.460
have another component, land.

04:02.460 --> 04:06.220
Land is always going to be some form of natural monopoly, there's only so much land in any

04:06.220 --> 04:07.220
given area.

04:07.220 --> 04:10.660
When a location is popular to live in, like say a city, there is a fixed amount of land

04:10.660 --> 04:11.660
there.

04:11.660 --> 04:15.300
And unlike other types of property, labor cannot create more supply of land.

04:15.300 --> 04:19.140
Labor can allow a single unit of land to be used by more people simultaneously, like

04:19.140 --> 04:22.640
you build smaller houses or you construct an apartment building or whatever, but labor

04:22.640 --> 04:24.940
cannot create more units of land.

04:24.940 --> 04:29.380
Additionally, land is permanent, sinking coastal properties or expensive reclamation projects

04:29.380 --> 04:30.380
notwithstanding.

04:30.380 --> 04:33.840
This is why you can have two purely identical houses in all respects, where one is valued

04:33.840 --> 04:37.780
significantly more in downtown LA and the other significantly less valued in the middle

04:37.780 --> 04:38.780
of Tennessee.

04:38.780 --> 04:40.380
Compare this with crackers.

04:40.380 --> 04:43.080
Crackers can be continually produced with more labor and materials.

04:43.080 --> 04:46.720
If for some reason, crackers suddenly became really trendy among rich people, companies

04:46.720 --> 04:50.020
would create premium luxury crackers with fancy gold labels that make them feel more

04:50.020 --> 04:51.200
exclusive or whatever.

04:51.200 --> 04:55.440
The cracker market can provide ever increasing quality and quantity of crackers to people

04:55.440 --> 04:56.600
who can afford to pay more.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.380
But you can't do this with land.

04:58.380 --> 05:02.720
The housing crisis is therefore less of a production crisis and more of a land crisis.

05:02.720 --> 05:07.360
The third and biggest difference, in my opinion, is that crackers have functioning market feedback

05:07.360 --> 05:08.760
while houses don't.

05:08.760 --> 05:12.380
Consider that an avid consumer of crackers can buy a box of crackers every day.

05:12.380 --> 05:15.420
Consider that there are many alternatives to crackers available, different brands, different

05:15.420 --> 05:21.200
types of crackers, alternative snack foods like chips or ice cream or fruit, I guess.

05:21.200 --> 05:24.980
Consider that crackers can be created, transported and stored relatively easily.

05:24.980 --> 05:28.260
And consider that it's not too hard to tell a good cracker from a bad cracker, whether

05:28.260 --> 05:32.040
that refers to your own personal taste in the cracker type or if the product is damaged

05:32.040 --> 05:33.580
or rotten or something like that.

05:33.580 --> 05:37.800
In this situation, the market feedback mechanisms of capitalism function very well because consumers

05:37.800 --> 05:40.900
have the opportunity to change where they buy crackers, which crackers they buy and

05:40.900 --> 05:41.900
how much they buy.

05:42.420 --> 05:44.780
And the producers of crackers can respond to the sales data they receive in order to

05:44.780 --> 05:46.180
maximize their business.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.100
This is something that a socialist planned economy can't actually do.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.500
Frederick Hayek described this as the calculation problem.

05:51.500 --> 05:55.140
In a capitalist system, the average consumer doesn't need to be well informed of the

05:55.140 --> 05:59.300
intricacies of the creation and distribution of five competing types of crackers, even

05:59.300 --> 06:02.840
if that information between the five different brands is highly specialized.

06:02.840 --> 06:06.900
Because all of that information shakes out in the price of the crackers, or more specifically,

06:06.900 --> 06:09.320
the price to enjoyment ratio for each consumer.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.040
Maybe you just want the cheapest cracker and you don't care about quality.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.680
Maybe you want the highest quality cracker.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.400
In that case, it's a reasonable bet that the highest priced crackers are the highest

06:16.400 --> 06:17.400
quality.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.800
Or maybe you have some specific taste that leads you to buy a niche product and you actually

06:20.800 --> 06:22.840
prefer it over the more higher priced stuff.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.840
I mean, who knows?

06:23.840 --> 06:27.920
The point is, the pricing of an item serves to tell you information about the items generalized

06:27.920 --> 06:32.040
quality, while the sales numbers of that item serves to tell the manufacturers the wishes

06:32.040 --> 06:33.040
of their customers.

06:33.040 --> 06:37.560
A moneyless communist economy has no way to provide feedback to the manufacturers of goods

06:37.760 --> 06:40.100
and will therefore always be highly inefficient.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.980
Even a market socialist economy will not be able to stimulate genuine competition, as

06:43.980 --> 06:48.300
individuals with local knowledge of local trading practices and markets have no incentive

06:48.300 --> 06:50.320
to share that knowledge with the central planners.

06:50.320 --> 06:54.240
However, even though Hayek's observation of the calculation problem is completely correct,

06:54.240 --> 06:57.300
this doesn't mean that it's functional in every market, and the housing market is

06:57.300 --> 06:59.240
one time where it doesn't work.

06:59.240 --> 07:00.560
Houses are different from crackers.

07:00.560 --> 07:04.140
You may buy a box of crackers a day and then the price to enjoyment ratio will shake out

07:04.140 --> 07:07.900
on its own, but nobody's really buying a house a day unless you're hyper-rich or

07:07.900 --> 07:08.900
something.

07:08.900 --> 07:09.900
The housing market is far more limited.

07:09.900 --> 07:13.940
You're only really comparing highly non-standard products in a specific area that you want

07:13.940 --> 07:17.740
to live, and even then only with the other houses on the market at that time.

07:17.740 --> 07:21.060
Buying a house is complicated, both legally and financially, and a layman will probably

07:21.060 --> 07:22.420
have to employ an agent.

07:22.420 --> 07:25.540
Even standardized housing layouts are going to differ from each other in terms of finishings,

07:25.540 --> 07:27.760
or age, or quality, or location.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.040
Problems with houses are sometimes not easy to discover at the time of purchase, but only

07:31.040 --> 07:32.260
pop up years later.

07:32.260 --> 07:35.300
You cannot know if the experience of living in the house that you're about to buy is

07:35.300 --> 07:38.500
comparable to the experience of living in other houses that are available for sale at

07:38.500 --> 07:39.500
the same time.

07:39.500 --> 07:43.300
In this market it's much harder for an individual on their own to make a rational, informed

07:43.300 --> 07:47.460
decision about their purchase, necessitating housing inspectors, housing insurance, trust

07:47.460 --> 07:50.800
in real estate agents, and if all else fails, government regulation.

07:50.800 --> 07:55.260
The housing market is one area in which natural pricing feedback mechanisms don't function,

07:55.260 --> 07:57.020
and therefore a purely free market wouldn't work.

07:57.020 --> 08:00.900
I know that libertarians and NCAPs don't like to hear this, but sometimes you guys

08:00.900 --> 08:02.700
are just as wrong as the socialists.

08:02.700 --> 08:05.800
But hey, at least they're not wrong like Philosophy Tube is, whose conclusion sounds

08:05.800 --> 08:06.800
a bit like this.

08:06.800 --> 08:10.300
And if it's already canon that people can have their property expropriated for a new

08:10.300 --> 08:15.100
mall, it's surely not that much of a leak to say they could be expropriated so people

08:15.100 --> 08:17.500
could actually live in them?

08:17.500 --> 08:21.180
Only this time the money for that forced buyout would be all the rent that's already been

08:21.180 --> 08:23.020
paid over the whole time the series has been running.

08:23.020 --> 08:26.820
But uh, Niall, if that's the case, then who owns all the properties?

08:26.820 --> 08:28.220
Well that's the awesome bit.

08:28.220 --> 08:29.860
Nobody does.

08:29.860 --> 08:30.860
You know what that means?

08:30.860 --> 08:35.580
The character in the comics has a job that they hate or their boss is an asshole or they

08:35.580 --> 08:40.460
need to take time off of work to care for a relative or paint a painting, write a novel,

08:40.460 --> 08:43.340
go on a protest, join a union, get involved in politics.

08:43.340 --> 08:44.340
They can do it!

08:44.340 --> 08:46.920
They can say, screw you, I don't need your job anymore!

08:46.920 --> 08:52.620
Because I don't need to make rent because there is no more rent.

08:52.620 --> 08:56.800
Some fanfiction writers like to imagine that the state could take over some of housing

08:56.800 --> 09:01.080
market's powers but that's kind of already been explored in an alternate universe run

09:01.080 --> 09:05.280
of the comics set in Russia which remains pretty controversial even among fans.

09:05.280 --> 09:09.800
Although another comic book writer called Hugo Chavez wrote his own spinoff series set

09:09.800 --> 09:16.160
in Venezuela where he used the state to recognize small teams of Venezuelan superheroes called

09:16.160 --> 09:20.900
communes and gave them the power to expropriate and administer property.

09:20.900 --> 09:24.800
That left the communes to do their own thing without the state getting too massive and

09:24.800 --> 09:30.680
bureaucratic but still gave those small teams of superheroes some backup and legal legitimacy

09:30.680 --> 09:31.960
when they needed it.

09:31.960 --> 09:35.500
Yeah, apparently landlords should have their property seized, no profit should ever be

09:35.500 --> 09:39.440
gained from owning houses, and control of housing should be devolved into communes.

09:39.440 --> 09:43.200
This is how you get Soviet era style apartment blocks, with communal kitchens and bathrooms

09:43.200 --> 09:44.280
for each floor.

09:44.280 --> 09:47.840
Because since there's no longer any pricing mechanism at all, the resources used must

09:47.840 --> 09:52.840
be allocated as anti-bourgeois as possible at the expense of things like comfort, security,

09:52.840 --> 09:55.040
functionality, and the consent of those who live there.

09:55.040 --> 09:58.120
This inevitably leads to the same live in the pod mentality we're seeing come out

09:58.120 --> 09:59.120
of LA right now.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.840
The only difference is that the Soviet version comes in 50 different shades of grey instead

10:02.840 --> 10:04.520
of rainbow colored paradoxically.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.640
In Philosophy Tube's system, who decides to build new houses?

10:07.640 --> 10:10.060
Where does labor and materials for those houses come from?

10:10.060 --> 10:12.160
Who owns these houses and what rights do they have?

10:12.160 --> 10:14.160
In the end it can only be the state.

10:14.160 --> 10:18.160
In this regard there's no difference between libertarian and authoritarian leftism.

10:18.160 --> 10:24.160
Those people who call themselves libertarian socialists must by necessity behave like Stalinists,

10:24.160 --> 10:27.480
because those people who build houses still need to be paid, and they still need to receive

10:27.480 --> 10:31.320
feedback from the desires of their customers in order to allocate their resources efficiently.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.560
Without that they end up being forced to build a bunch of shit that nobody really wants and

10:34.560 --> 10:39.360
will go entirely unused, like China's empty cities, unless the state forces people into

10:39.360 --> 10:41.120
them like the Soviet Union did.

10:41.120 --> 10:44.500
Another person who has a pretty awful take on this topic is unlearning economics, which

10:44.500 --> 10:48.140
I found surprising because generally he's pretty insightful, at least for a socialist,

10:48.140 --> 10:51.420
and his criticism of Philosophy Tube hits a few of the same points that mine does.

10:51.420 --> 10:55.260
He released a video titled The Death of Economics 101, where he tackles a number of different

10:55.260 --> 10:56.800
topics, including the housing crisis.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.860
This time the subtopic is rent control.

10:58.860 --> 11:02.180
Rent control is when government regulation artificially lowers the price of rent below

11:02.180 --> 11:05.900
what the market can bear, in an effort to provide low income housing to poor people.

11:05.900 --> 11:10.020
However, in my opinion rent control lowers the quality and the quantity of rents available.

11:10.020 --> 11:11.320
Here's my hunch.

11:11.320 --> 11:14.820
Unlike all products in a free market, supply and demand for rental units eventually reach

11:14.820 --> 11:15.820
an equilibrium.

11:15.820 --> 11:19.540
But because rent control targets a specific type of property and artificially lowers its

11:19.540 --> 11:23.040
price below that equilibrium, we should be able to observe a few effects.

11:23.040 --> 11:27.020
First, new buildings that will be constructed will likely be of a type not subject to that

11:27.020 --> 11:30.920
rent control, and so the supply of non-rent controlled units will rise accordingly.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.200
Secondly, old buildings that are covered by rent control will be converted into other

11:34.200 --> 11:37.680
types of property if it's profitable to do so, lowering the supply of the controlled

11:37.680 --> 11:38.680
units.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.760
Thirdly, there will be cases where it might be better for the landlord to simply destroy

11:40.800 --> 11:44.000
the property or keep it empty, if the rent control is severe enough.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.400
And finally, maintenance on the controlled locations will be less frequent, due to less

11:47.400 --> 11:51.400
resources the landlord has to perform them, leading to a slow decline in quality over

11:51.400 --> 11:52.400
time.

11:52.400 --> 11:56.320
In other words, long term rent control should cause the quality and quantity of rental units

11:56.320 --> 11:57.320
to decrease.

11:57.320 --> 12:01.520
And learning economics as a counterpoint to this, is that the reduction of quantity is

12:01.520 --> 12:05.780
not in the supply of housing, but in the supply of housing specifically used for renting.

12:05.780 --> 12:11.340
The supply and demand for houses should balance, with rents at R-star and quantity at Q-star.

12:11.340 --> 12:13.500
What does rent control do in this situation?

12:13.500 --> 12:18.420
It's represented by the horizontal line RC, which forces rents down.

12:18.420 --> 12:24.020
At this low rental rate, the quantity of houses supplied is lower than the previous equilibrium,

12:24.020 --> 12:26.300
even though more people want to rent.

12:26.300 --> 12:30.540
We have a shortage, and a fall in rented units compared to the free market.

12:30.540 --> 12:35.100
The blanket opposition to rent control that derives from this is hugely overstated.

12:35.100 --> 12:38.980
I would contend that the supply demand model can mislead people into thinking that the

12:38.980 --> 12:44.580
reduction is in housing supply, rather than the number of houses specifically used for

12:44.580 --> 12:45.580
renting.

12:45.580 --> 12:47.600
Maybe I'm an idiot, but I don't see how that's a meaningful difference.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.660
In fact, I think that's the point of the criticism of rent control.

12:50.660 --> 12:52.880
It means that there's less places for people to rent.

12:52.880 --> 12:56.020
Like here, let's assume that you've got a bunch of mid-range houses that private owners

12:56.020 --> 12:59.280
want to rent, but rent control makes it more profitable to sell them.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.220
Suddenly there's a bunch of new houses on the market.

13:01.220 --> 13:04.180
Maybe the extra supply causes the price of these houses to drop a little bit, and maybe

13:04.180 --> 13:08.180
a middle-class family that couldn't afford that house right away can now do so instead

13:08.180 --> 13:09.700
of having to wait another year or two.

13:09.700 --> 13:12.940
That is a good short-term benefit, but the lowest classes, the people who would never

13:12.940 --> 13:16.300
be able to afford that house and must rent it, they suffer because the landlords can

13:16.300 --> 13:18.020
no longer afford to rent it to them.

13:18.020 --> 13:19.180
It's kind of like minimum wage.

13:19.180 --> 13:22.940
It might help some people in the middle, but those at the bottom suffer disproportionately,

13:22.940 --> 13:26.700
as they are priced out of the market due to an external force fixing the variables.

13:26.700 --> 13:31.200
And speaking of minimum wage, Unlearning Economics shows the IGM Chicago polls on rent control,

13:31.200 --> 13:35.000
but he doesn't show the IGM Chicago polls during his minimum wage part of this video,

13:35.000 --> 13:39.120
which would have massively weakened his minimum wage arguments, but that's for another time.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.600
Next up, Unlearning Economics brings up an article about how rent control ruined the

13:42.600 --> 13:43.960
Berlin rental economy.

13:43.960 --> 13:48.280
A paper on the phenomenon, unfortunately only available in German, shows that rents for

13:48.280 --> 13:51.380
the controlled locations plummeted, as is to be expected.

13:51.380 --> 13:54.220
But there's no discussion on whether or not these were rental units held by people who

13:54.220 --> 13:55.400
actually needed that relief.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.700
For example, a person making six figures while living in a hole on a wall with five other

13:58.700 --> 14:02.700
guys for a year so he can save up money and launch a startup or buy a house or something.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.800
He certainly doesn't need the relief of rent control, but a poor family with no other option

14:05.800 --> 14:08.420
but to live in that location might actually need that help.

14:08.420 --> 14:12.600
But also, rent controlled apartments ended up being worth less in sale value, and as

14:12.600 --> 14:16.940
expected, the value and rents of their uncontrolled counterparts skyrocketed.

14:16.940 --> 14:21.500
The supply of controlled units dropped by 50%, while the supply of uncontrolled units

14:21.500 --> 14:24.100
shot up disproportionately over 100%.

14:24.100 --> 14:27.620
And Unlearning Economics's response is to say that these things are good, and that the

14:27.620 --> 14:29.960
article he's reading is just crap?

14:29.960 --> 14:34.300
As you're all now budding natural experiment enthusiasts, I know what you're going to ask.

14:34.300 --> 14:38.740
Is there any more credible evidence than this crap on rent control?

14:38.740 --> 14:40.520
This isn't a reply, man.

14:40.520 --> 14:45.020
Rent control seems to have some short-term good effects for some slice of the population,

14:45.020 --> 14:48.740
but it also seems to have long-term bad effects for everybody except the ultra-rich.

14:48.740 --> 14:52.620
Unlearning Economics then talks about a study conducted on rent control in San Francisco

14:52.620 --> 14:57.180
in 1994, where a recent city policy saw that old units were rent controlled, while newly

14:57.180 --> 14:58.460
built units were not.

14:58.460 --> 15:03.180
He says that this paper claims the policy led to a 15% reduction in total rental units

15:03.180 --> 15:04.180
available.

15:04.180 --> 15:10.180
What the paper actually claims, what he presents on screen in his own video, is that 7.2% of

15:10.180 --> 15:14.620
rent controlled properties underwent renovations to evade rent control but still remained on

15:14.620 --> 15:20.020
the market as non-rent controlled units, while 8.1% of rent controlled units were sold to

15:20.020 --> 15:23.540
owner-occupants, meaning the new owner decided to live in the property themselves rather

15:23.540 --> 15:25.660
than rent it out, taking it off the rental market.

15:25.660 --> 15:28.060
The paper's abstract restates these effects as well.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.380
Rent control limited renters' mobility by 20%.

15:30.380 --> 15:35.020
15% of rent controlled units were either sold to people intending to live in them directly

15:35.020 --> 15:39.740
or redeveloped by landlords to become non-controlled units but still available for rent.

15:39.740 --> 15:43.300
And while rent control prevents displacement of renters in the short-term, long-term it

15:43.300 --> 15:46.260
drove rent prices up across the entire market.

15:46.260 --> 15:55.300
He also says that a specific graph from this paper shows rents fell, but look at it.

15:55.300 --> 15:59.780
It says renters, not rents, people renting, not price of renting.

15:59.780 --> 16:03.860
The number of people renting a rent controlled unit fell at the same rate as rent controlled

16:03.860 --> 16:07.980
units were sold or converted into higher priced, non-rent controlled counterparts.

16:07.980 --> 16:11.180
In other words, those landlords who either found it more profitable to renovate or sell

16:11.180 --> 16:15.000
the property or could no longer afford to keep renting at the new controlled rate had

16:15.000 --> 16:17.980
a higher chance of just folding and so the tenant suffered.

16:17.980 --> 16:21.860
Paying a rent that's bankrupting you is certainly bad, but being entirely priced out

16:21.860 --> 16:23.240
of the market is worse.

16:23.240 --> 16:26.840
The problem isn't necessarily that inequality is bad, after all we all know that inequality

16:26.840 --> 16:29.660
is required for innovation or production to actually happen.

16:29.660 --> 16:34.120
The problem is that extreme inequality has a snowballing effect into other areas of society,

16:34.120 --> 16:37.380
and that rent control is a force that exacerbates those other effects.

16:37.380 --> 16:41.200
The paper suggests that one of these knock-on effects is that middle class people are less

16:41.200 --> 16:43.760
and less likely to move into a rent controlled area.

16:43.760 --> 16:47.540
It turns out that a rent controlled neighborhood ends up containing only homeless people until

16:47.540 --> 16:51.400
they migrate away or get arrested or something, those few middle class people who did actually

16:51.400 --> 16:54.060
snag a good housing deal and the ultra wealthy.

16:54.060 --> 16:58.240
And if the majority of an area is wealthy, the other non-housing amenities in that area

16:58.240 --> 16:59.840
will also see their prices rise.

16:59.840 --> 17:04.400
In other words, the demand for high priced, high quality goods from upscale stores will

17:04.400 --> 17:08.760
outpace the demand for low priced, low quality goods sold at Walmart or Dollar Tree, and

17:08.760 --> 17:11.880
eventually those people living in rent controlled housing will only be able to afford their

17:11.880 --> 17:14.240
rent and nothing else in their area.

17:14.240 --> 17:18.860
In essence, if some suburb or sub-community is a highly priced bubble, with its internal

17:18.860 --> 17:23.900
economy being quite expensive, a rent control law does serve to increase lower class access

17:23.900 --> 17:24.900
to that location.

17:24.900 --> 17:28.400
But the long term effects of this is that those people who gained access will rapidly

17:28.400 --> 17:31.940
find themselves priced out of not only their own neighborhoods, but surrounding neighborhoods

17:31.940 --> 17:36.260
as well, because this sort of unearned access has knock-on effects in the larger economy.

17:36.260 --> 17:41.320
The 1994 San Francisco paper ends by stating that rent control has contributed to gentrification

17:41.320 --> 17:45.220
by simultaneously bringing in higher income residents while preventing the displacement

17:45.220 --> 17:46.220
of minorities.

17:46.220 --> 17:49.060
And here's how Unlearning Economics replies to this.

17:49.060 --> 17:53.060
Keeping existing residents in the area while rich residents join is a bad thing.

17:53.060 --> 17:56.980
The solution is obviously to have only rich residents so the income inequality in the

17:56.980 --> 17:57.980
area is low.

17:57.980 --> 18:01.260
In his defence, it's hard to see this effect as it's not always visible.

18:01.260 --> 18:03.060
But a big problem with rent control is what I mentioned earlier.

18:03.060 --> 18:06.380
There will always be people who would move into the community and contribute to it, but

18:06.380 --> 18:10.060
now do not because rent controlled units are over consumed due to the lower price and the

18:10.060 --> 18:13.020
additional housing stock being created will be overpriced for them.

18:13.020 --> 18:16.220
The supply goes down, costs go up, and now you've got an entire class of people who

18:16.220 --> 18:20.260
aren't moving in while rich people can still afford the area, increasing the inequality

18:20.260 --> 18:21.900
you're aiming to fight with your regulation.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.420
Unlearning Economics ends his talk like this.

18:24.420 --> 18:28.880
So it's bad when existing tenants stay but also bad when they leave?

18:28.880 --> 18:30.740
Gentrification is good but also bad?

18:30.740 --> 18:34.560
I found this paper quite confusing, and it seems to be a go-to reference for opponents

18:34.560 --> 18:35.740
of rent control.

18:35.740 --> 18:39.700
With such a variety of competing effects, the authors eventually conclude that the overall

18:39.700 --> 18:42.060
effects of rent control are a wash.

18:42.060 --> 18:43.340
And he's just lying to you.

18:43.340 --> 18:46.260
The paper does not state the effects of rent control are a wash.

18:46.260 --> 18:49.860
Instead, the paper states that the beneficiaries of rent control are more likely to remain

18:49.860 --> 18:53.200
at their current location because they're getting a good deal, that rent control disproportionately

18:53.200 --> 18:56.380
helps minorities as well as people who have a longer history at their current location,

18:56.380 --> 19:00.380
and that on the flip side, non-controlled areas saw people cycling through their rental

19:00.380 --> 19:03.460
units faster, as both landlords and tenants try to get better deals.

19:03.460 --> 19:07.580
They also found that landlords avoid rent control by converting rental units to condos

19:07.580 --> 19:09.700
or by renovating the building to avoid regulation.

19:09.700 --> 19:13.900
The reduction in low-cost rent supply, as well as the new availability of high-cost

19:13.900 --> 19:18.240
rent supply, or condos and houses for sale, ultimately created a housing market geared

19:18.240 --> 19:21.020
more towards higher-income individuals in the long term.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.660
This is not a wash, this is a failure of the policy.

19:23.660 --> 19:27.400
The last video we'll talk about today is Hassan's, and his is probably the funniest

19:27.400 --> 19:31.060
of all, because to be honest Hassan is a joke, it's 30 minutes of him whining about not

19:31.060 --> 19:32.060
being able to buy a house.

19:32.060 --> 19:35.920
The video title is correct, but he brings to the table a simple explanation for all

19:35.920 --> 19:38.380
of these things, filtered through his own political lens.

19:38.380 --> 19:40.620
I hope he actually paid the editor of this video this time.

20:08.380 --> 20:31.340
Hassan doesn't understand that the value of a house is largely dependent on the value

20:31.340 --> 20:33.220
of other houses in the same area on the market.

20:33.220 --> 20:37.160
This is a complex formulation that takes into account location, house quality, willingness

20:37.160 --> 20:40.680
to sell, but it's not nearly as simple as Hassan makes it out to be.

20:40.680 --> 20:43.920
Like if there's 10 comparable houses on the same street, and they all get listed,

20:43.920 --> 20:47.280
and the first one goes for way over asking price, the others probably will too.

21:37.160 --> 21:55.760
It's really funny listening to Hassan complain about these numbers, knowing how much he makes,

21:55.760 --> 21:57.080
this is not a problem for him.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.960
This is what breadtubers do when they try their hand in economic analysis, you know.

21:59.960 --> 22:03.680
They shit all over one side of an economic transaction, and ignore the other side because

22:03.680 --> 22:04.680
that's all they're interested in.

22:04.680 --> 22:08.060
Right now people selling their homes are making a killing, they're doing very well, but people

22:08.060 --> 22:11.120
like Hassan only care about the buyers of homes that are getting fucked over.

22:11.120 --> 22:14.720
Meanwhile when it comes to the buyers of labour right now, they're having to jack up wages

22:14.720 --> 22:17.360
because no one wants to actually work for minimum wage during this climate, and these

22:17.360 --> 22:21.380
same breadtubers complaining about the difficulty of buying homes are laughing at the difficulty

22:21.380 --> 22:24.680
of buying labour, simply because it suits their politics and the targets are acceptable

22:24.680 --> 22:25.680
to them.

22:25.680 --> 22:29.280
The actual truth is, both of these things can be negative if pushed too far.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.400
Upward pressure on wages can certainly be a bad thing, you know, probably not yet, but

22:32.400 --> 22:35.880
if it was like $50 an hour for a burger flipper job or something, absolutely.

22:35.880 --> 22:36.880
Same with housing.

22:36.880 --> 22:40.240
But Hassan only cares about the buyer's side of the housing equation, just like he only

22:40.240 --> 22:43.320
cares about the seller's side of the labour equation, because he doesn't actually care

22:43.320 --> 22:48.120
about the damage done by his idealized policies, he only cares if the correct people are hurt

22:49.120 --> 22:52.400
The house itself is a depreciating asset.

22:52.400 --> 22:57.420
The land, on the other hand, is an appreciating asset, especially when you're purchasing land

22:57.420 --> 23:01.640
in like fucking Los Angeles, in like a really good area of Los Angeles.

23:01.640 --> 23:05.640
I don't know why Hassan thinks houses are depreciating assets, they're not quite like

23:05.640 --> 23:06.640
cars, you know.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.560
Yeah there's maintenance, but houses can absolutely appreciate over time depending on the market.

23:09.560 --> 23:15.380
Like hedge funds are straight up purchasing as much, as many houses as they fucking can,

23:15.380 --> 23:19.140
so that they can turn around and start renting it to people, so they can become landlords.

23:19.140 --> 23:25.520
Which ironically creates a system where buying a house is unaffordable for most average Joe's,

23:25.520 --> 23:28.160
so they are stuck renting forever.

23:28.160 --> 23:34.900
So it is a problem that basically creates another opportunity for, you know, these hedge

23:34.900 --> 23:37.980
funds to make more money.

23:37.980 --> 23:42.380
It's not just fucking hedge funds buying up all the houses and renting them to people.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.900
This is like a child's take on housing.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.780
And that's not to say it's not happening in some places, it certainly is a little bit.

23:46.780 --> 23:50.100
You've got a massive crash during COVID, the value of everybody's property went down, businesses

23:50.100 --> 23:53.780
closed up, etc, etc, and the people who made a killing are the ones who vacuumed up property

23:53.780 --> 23:56.980
when they were at COVID lows, because that property value will inevitably bounce back.

23:56.980 --> 23:58.340
That's not the only variable here.

23:58.340 --> 24:01.740
What's also happening is, now that lockdowns are coming to a close in a lot of places,

24:01.740 --> 24:04.860
you've got tons of people moving, whether that be out of cities or back closer to work

24:04.860 --> 24:08.460
as work at home ends, you've got a historically low interest rate on mortgages, you've got

24:08.460 --> 24:12.060
many potential sellers shelving their plans due to uncertainty, you've got many potential

24:12.060 --> 24:15.540
buyers who have reduced their incidental spending due to lockdowns while working at home and

24:15.540 --> 24:18.420
saving money or taking pay raises for outside essential work.

24:18.420 --> 24:22.280
This has all resulted with more buyers having more money and less sellers willing to sell.

24:22.280 --> 24:26.040
It's not just opportunistic rich people monopolistically buying everything.

24:26.040 --> 24:32.820
It might sound cool when your dad makes, you know, 100,000 above asking price on his fucking

24:32.820 --> 24:36.660
house, but it's not going to be so great when he can't find another house to purchase.

24:36.660 --> 24:41.020
And that's the reality when people are leaving California, they're not leaving California

24:41.020 --> 24:42.020
because of taxes.

24:42.020 --> 24:43.580
That's a lie.

24:43.580 --> 24:47.860
It's poor people leaving California because they can't afford to live in California, so

24:47.860 --> 24:49.620
they fucking go somewhere else.

24:49.620 --> 24:54.140
They simply cannot afford to rent or even purchase a home.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.260
Here's one thing that sounds actually correct about it's not about taxes.

24:56.260 --> 24:58.940
It might be for corporations, it might be for business owners, people who can work from

24:58.940 --> 25:01.300
literally anywhere, but it's not for the average person.

25:01.300 --> 25:04.620
Average people don't make nearly as many decisions based on taxes as we think they do.

25:04.620 --> 25:07.660
It's highly unlikely that you'll choose a job or a place to live based on the marginal

25:07.660 --> 25:09.980
tax rate of the area in most situations.

25:09.980 --> 25:13.220
It's okay if people are priced out of some market, Sasan.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.300
Not everybody has to live in California.

25:15.300 --> 25:18.420
Stop looking down on what you coastal elites call flyover states.

25:18.420 --> 25:21.380
That dude who called you a snob in your own chat and you got insulted by it?

25:21.380 --> 25:23.140
You just fucking proved him right.

25:23.140 --> 25:26.620
Motherfuckers that are finally able to afford a home because they have like an amount of

25:26.620 --> 25:31.540
capital that they've accrued over the course of the fucking pandemic are so fucked when

25:31.540 --> 25:36.540
basically they're not able to refinance, when basically they realize that the investment

25:36.540 --> 25:41.980
property that they purchased and now that they're stuck with is not going to hold its

25:41.980 --> 25:47.100
value, especially if they fucking bought it in some random area that is not slated to

25:47.100 --> 25:51.860
appreciate to the goddamn moon like you would in certain parts of California, like in fucking

25:51.860 --> 25:52.860
Los Angeles.

25:52.860 --> 25:53.860
And then they're fucked.

25:53.860 --> 25:57.660
And even if they are able to refinance at that point, the interest rates are going to

25:57.660 --> 25:58.660
be higher.

25:58.660 --> 26:04.860
So no matter what their refinance works, now they have a property that's value is lower

26:04.860 --> 26:06.660
that you're absolutely stuck with.

26:06.660 --> 26:10.260
Didn't you just say that hedge funds are buying up everything and making a killing

26:10.260 --> 26:12.420
and renting it all out to people and turning us all into serfs?

26:12.420 --> 26:15.700
But now people who buy homes are fucked because they won't be valuable?

26:15.700 --> 26:17.740
Would that also affect the hedge funds?

26:17.740 --> 26:20.740
You can really tell when somebody is making an analysis based on ideology and not on the

26:20.740 --> 26:21.740
facts.

26:21.740 --> 26:25.580
I'm still so mad that like I lost the dream house that I literally found.

26:25.580 --> 26:28.380
It was like the second house I went to and it was my dream house.

26:28.380 --> 26:33.240
It was still of course expensive, obviously above like what the market rate would be for

26:33.240 --> 26:34.240
something like that.

26:34.240 --> 26:38.300
But it was affordable in comparison to like all these other fucking places I've seen.

26:38.300 --> 26:39.300
And I lost it.

26:39.300 --> 26:40.300
And it fucking sucks.

26:40.300 --> 26:42.220
I was going to have a pool boys.

26:42.220 --> 26:43.220
It's the second.

26:43.220 --> 26:44.220
Okay, dude.

26:44.220 --> 26:45.220
Listen, it'll be fine.

26:45.220 --> 26:46.300
It's not your it's not your dream house.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.940
I'm sure there are other fish in the sea.

26:47.940 --> 26:51.480
This is definitely like a first time home buyers story, isn't it?

26:51.480 --> 26:55.160
It was my dream house, dude, your Hassan.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.160
Just just buy it.

26:56.160 --> 26:57.160
You have the money.

26:57.160 --> 26:58.160
Pay for it.

26:58.160 --> 27:02.720
Like this is a rich guy coming into a poor neighborhood, talking to a poor homeowner

27:02.720 --> 27:06.440
complaining that he sold his house to another guy who's also poor, just pay the fucking

27:06.440 --> 27:07.440
price dude.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.320
Hassan is so angry.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.120
He couldn't fuck a dude out of his house.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.520
Like what is his solution here?

27:12.520 --> 27:15.440
Should he have been able to force the seller to sell him that at the lower price?

27:15.440 --> 27:16.440
Like what does he want?

27:16.440 --> 27:24.600
Sold for 78% over asking, it was listed at $1 million, it's over 2.12, a three bedroom

27:24.600 --> 27:27.920
three bathroom in fucking Mount Washington.

27:27.920 --> 27:30.520
It's actually kind of cool though.

27:30.520 --> 27:31.520
Holy shit.

27:31.520 --> 27:34.200
Hassan is looking at one of the richest areas in the world.

27:34.200 --> 27:38.720
Are you seriously talking like these, these secluded stately mansions are somehow relevant

27:38.720 --> 27:40.320
to the wider housing market?

27:40.320 --> 27:44.640
Are you actually complaining that you can't pay like 300, $500 a month or something and

27:44.640 --> 27:47.320
live in some woodland compound?

27:47.320 --> 27:50.480
Is the US running out of houses?

27:50.480 --> 27:54.360
The housing shortage conversation is kind of bullshit.

27:54.360 --> 27:55.360
And here's why.

27:55.360 --> 28:00.080
There are so many vacant fucking properties, dude.

28:00.080 --> 28:03.760
There are so many vacant properties.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.680
It actually is because inventory is historically low.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.780
That is the main driver of the situation.

28:08.780 --> 28:11.920
We are at the lowest point in history for housing availability.

28:11.920 --> 28:14.380
Anna Kasparian had a shit take about this subject recently.

28:14.380 --> 28:19.160
She tweeted, America is short of homes as a strange focus when foreign capital and private

28:19.160 --> 28:22.680
equity funds are snatching up all available housing for their portfolios.

28:22.680 --> 28:26.000
I'm sick of hearing about the shortage of housing as homes owned by people who don't

28:26.000 --> 28:27.640
even live in the US sit empty.

28:27.640 --> 28:31.560
And that does happen sometimes, but the problem with this point of view that rich people are

28:31.560 --> 28:35.380
buying homes and keeping them vacant and that's the driver of the housing crisis and therefore

28:35.380 --> 28:39.280
we shouldn't have to worry about building new homes is that it's ultimately a counterproductive

28:39.280 --> 28:40.280
view.

28:40.280 --> 28:43.180
One, most vacancies aren't where people want to live.

28:43.180 --> 28:46.480
The highest vacancy rates in the United States are in low demand places.

28:46.480 --> 28:49.680
Of course, the lowest vacancy rates are on the West Coast and in the Northeast.

28:49.680 --> 28:52.880
Telling somebody in the Bay Area that there's an abandoned house in Detroit they can move

28:52.880 --> 28:55.320
to isn't really a solution to their problem.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.680
Two, vacancies aren't all the same.

28:57.680 --> 29:02.580
Census data shows us that 50% of all vacancies are called market vacancies, which is a term

29:02.580 --> 29:06.480
describing the inevitable gaps in tenancy that can occur when a lease ends.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.960
Sometimes there's trouble finding new tenants, sometimes a deal falls through last minute,

29:09.960 --> 29:11.960
sometimes there's repairs to be done, whatever.

29:11.960 --> 29:15.040
Landlords lose money when a home is vacant and they're already incentivized by the market

29:15.040 --> 29:17.720
for these market vacancies to be as short as possible.

29:17.720 --> 29:22.220
Three, landlords love low vacancy rates because it gives them much more market power.

29:22.220 --> 29:25.140
If somebody shows up in their neighborhood and builds a bunch of new rental units, the

29:25.140 --> 29:29.200
vacancy rate goes up, competition goes up, rents go down, and the power of currently

29:29.200 --> 29:31.900
existing landlords over the market goes down as well.

29:31.900 --> 29:35.940
Not building new units strengthens the position of those currently existing landlords, while

29:35.940 --> 29:39.420
building more homes opens the market to further competition pressure.

29:39.420 --> 29:42.980
Four, a vacancy rate of zero is disastrous.

29:42.980 --> 29:45.700
You would not be able to ever move into a new location because there would be no available

29:45.700 --> 29:46.700
locations at all.

29:46.700 --> 29:47.700
Kids moving to their own place?

29:47.700 --> 29:49.220
Nope, they got to stay at home.

29:49.220 --> 29:50.220
Immigrants?

29:50.220 --> 29:51.220
Nowhere for them to go.

29:51.220 --> 29:55.020
Low vacancies means that if you want to move, you have to trade houses with somebody else,

29:55.020 --> 29:58.880
while the existence of at least some vacancies allows for market fluidity.

29:58.880 --> 30:02.400
The problem with the current housing crisis is there's no easy solution.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.660
All the dumb shit that breadtubers say equate to entitled whining that just makes things

30:06.660 --> 30:08.340
far worse than they already are.

30:08.340 --> 30:11.840
But because land is a constant rather than a variable means that we will always have

30:11.840 --> 30:14.220
this problem in the most costly cities on earth.

30:14.220 --> 30:18.580
No matter what, not everybody can live in downtown LA or on Manhattan Island, and that's

30:18.580 --> 30:19.580
that.

30:19.580 --> 30:20.580
There's just not enough space.

30:20.580 --> 30:21.580
But that's okay.

30:21.580 --> 30:24.020
It's okay if people are priced out of certain locations.

30:24.020 --> 30:27.660
Not everybody has to live in a megacity, and forcing yourself into a tin can to stay in

30:27.660 --> 30:29.820
Southern California isn't really good for you.

30:29.820 --> 30:32.900
Driving on the highway to and from your job every day, cramped in your car, breathing

30:32.900 --> 30:36.180
in the city's smog because you want to live in the place to be, is probably the biggest,

30:36.180 --> 30:37.820
most dumb fuck way you can waste your life.

30:37.820 --> 30:40.020
Let's say you work for ten years, commuting two hours a day.

30:40.020 --> 30:43.360
You're going to end up in your thirties with chronic and curable back pain, a lot less

30:43.360 --> 30:46.900
money than you should have, and if you properly used that time you wasted in your car, you

30:46.900 --> 30:49.820
could have become masterclass at some skill or hobby.

30:49.820 --> 30:52.780
I have the right to live in LA, shut up, no you don't.

30:52.780 --> 30:55.700
Millennials and Zoomers have this feeling that Metropolis is the only place you should

30:55.700 --> 30:59.800
aspire to end up, that hometowns are places to be moved on from and be embarrassed by,

30:59.800 --> 31:03.300
and they're rapidly discovering that even though the city has its amenities, it doesn't

31:03.300 --> 31:04.300
have community.

31:04.300 --> 31:07.060
I think this is why progs throw around the community as a label so much, they don't

31:07.060 --> 31:08.480
actually fucking know what it means.

31:08.480 --> 31:13.060
My generation spent so much time considering their small town origins as a waiting room,

31:13.060 --> 31:16.760
feeling some indescribable pull towards the rootlessness of city life, and its revolving

31:16.760 --> 31:20.960
door of new people, new experiences, and new locations, that a lot of millennials who

31:20.960 --> 31:25.320
are now in their thirties are finding themselves lonely and not actually able to understand

31:25.320 --> 31:26.320
why.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.320
But here's why.

31:27.320 --> 31:30.760
The transient nature of that lifestyle, the in-betweenness that's so appealing, ultimately

31:30.760 --> 31:32.520
leaves you with nothing solid to stand on.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.920
I can't find the article at the time of writing this script, I'm sure I'll be able to put

31:34.920 --> 31:38.400
it on the screen and post, about a journalist who is having a farewell get together at the

31:38.400 --> 31:43.120
bar for a colleague who was moving to Hong Kong for a new job back in early 2020.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.920
I'm sure that probably turned out not to be a good career move, actually.

31:45.920 --> 31:50.460
But the point is, among the transients, the in-betweens, there's no sense of community.

31:50.460 --> 31:51.640
There's no neighborhood.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.420
There's no family you get to know next door as your kids grow up together.

31:54.420 --> 31:58.020
You've got your work colleagues, whom you only talk to about work, and whom you only

31:58.020 --> 31:59.520
get along with when you're drinking.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.760
And there's no guarantee that connection will remain when they suddenly fly off, leaving

32:02.760 --> 32:03.760
nothing behind.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.400
They don't really care about you, and you don't really care about them.

32:06.400 --> 32:08.680
Your life path simply happened to align for a little while.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.720
It doesn't have to be this way.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.800
Even living in a city, it doesn't have to be this way.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.640
But there's certainly something about a specific type of city living that makes people

32:15.640 --> 32:19.160
think that they're disposable and treat others as if they were disposable in return.

32:19.160 --> 32:22.720
It's no surprise to me that millennials and zoomers are having trouble forming lasting

32:22.720 --> 32:23.720
relationships.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.440
I'm not saying that everybody has to return to tradition and live in the same house they

32:26.440 --> 32:30.080
grew up in, or farm on some homestead with five acres or whatever.

32:30.080 --> 32:33.260
You can live in some suburb half an hour outside of downtown and maintain a sense of community

32:33.260 --> 32:34.260
just fine.

32:34.260 --> 32:38.260
I'm saying that embracing a lifestyle that prioritizes novelty over connection, that

32:38.260 --> 32:41.960
values width over depth, will ultimately make you unhappy.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.960
And that lifestyle is uniquely incentivized by city living.

32:44.960 --> 32:48.360
These are people who think that their real life will finally start once they move, ignoring

32:48.360 --> 32:52.240
the fact that their life is already passing them by right now as they wait, failing to

32:52.240 --> 32:56.000
realize that even if they manage to do more, they're still the same person with the same

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
baggage.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
This is just armchair psychology for me, but I think the reason they do it is because they

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
have big dreams.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.880
And rather than knuckling down and doing the work right now, it's easy to keep the looming

33:04.880 --> 33:07.920
failure at arm's length by saying that they have to move to the big city before they can

33:07.920 --> 33:08.980
really get going.

33:08.980 --> 33:11.360
Or if they're already in the big city, they have to move to the next spot.

33:11.760 --> 33:15.640
A lot of people have been messaging me recently about Georgism as a solution to the land problem.

33:15.640 --> 33:19.620
A philosophy created by Henry George, Georgism is the belief that people should own the value

33:19.620 --> 33:22.600
they produce themselves, both in labor and in trade.

33:22.600 --> 33:26.240
Meaning no income taxes, no trade taxes, no purchase taxes.

33:26.240 --> 33:30.520
But that because land will always be some level of natural monopoly, the economic value

33:30.520 --> 33:34.240
derived from the land itself and its natural resources should be taxed.

33:34.240 --> 33:37.880
In other words, if you own a business and generate profit, it shouldn't be taxed.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.480
If you build a house, that shouldn't be taxed.

33:39.700 --> 33:43.520
But the land your business or house sits on should be taxed, as should any resources you

33:43.520 --> 33:46.160
pull from the natural world, like water or minerals.

33:46.160 --> 33:49.440
The logic is you may have created your house or your business, either directly with your

33:49.440 --> 33:52.800
labor or indirectly by working elsewhere and then paying for it, but you didn't create

33:52.800 --> 33:54.400
the land or its resources.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.840
That was provided by nature.

33:55.840 --> 34:00.120
It holds its value because of society and therefore a land tax rather than a capital

34:00.120 --> 34:02.700
or labor tax should be what funds the government.

34:02.700 --> 34:06.840
Many economists since the days of Adam Smith have noted that unlike all other forms of

34:06.840 --> 34:11.000
taxation, a land tax doesn't create economic inefficiency like the minimum wage or generate

34:11.000 --> 34:12.840
holes in the market like rent control.

34:12.840 --> 34:15.080
And modern experiments seem to bear this out.

34:15.080 --> 34:19.360
Queensland, Australia ran a land tax experiment and the results seem to show that it had little

34:19.360 --> 34:23.300
effect on the price of housing, but it did increase the total number of houses for sale.

34:23.300 --> 34:27.940
The land tax was seen by Karl Marx as a method that would alleviate the working class's woes,

34:27.940 --> 34:31.320
but ultimately rejected it as it would prevent a transition to a socialist economy.

34:31.320 --> 34:36.260
At the same time, Milton Friedman described the land tax as the least bad tax since it

34:36.260 --> 34:40.300
only targets what individuals did not create with their labor and it imposes little burden

34:40.300 --> 34:41.500
on economic activity.

34:41.500 --> 34:45.340
If you can get these two guys to begrudgingly agree that the idea is a good one and the

34:45.340 --> 34:49.100
only reason they don't like it is because it doesn't square away with their pet projects,

34:49.100 --> 34:50.980
you've probably got something special on your hands.

34:50.980 --> 34:52.500
To be honest, I don't know how I feel about Georgism.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.740
I had to begin reading up on it specifically for this video and my opinion isn't fully

34:55.740 --> 34:56.740
formed yet.

34:56.740 --> 34:58.100
At face value, it seems alright.

34:58.100 --> 35:01.540
I know something that's commonly advocated for nowadays is a use tax, meaning that if

35:01.540 --> 35:04.240
you own property but you're just sitting on it and not putting it to use, you should

35:04.240 --> 35:05.240
be taxed for it.

35:05.240 --> 35:08.600
Considering the current problem in Vancouver, for example, where Chinese nationals want

35:08.600 --> 35:12.580
to hide money from the Chinese Communist Party and do so by buying Canadian homes and then

35:12.580 --> 35:15.440
simply letting them sit around empty because they don't want to go through the hassle

35:15.440 --> 35:18.940
of renting them to people, I can see why this sort of use tax is becoming appealing.

35:18.940 --> 35:22.880
But as long as there's an impetus to own your own property, this will always be a problem.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.120
And no, the solution isn't to tell people that they'll own nothing and be happy or

35:26.120 --> 35:28.320
to live in the pod and eat the bugs and rent forever.

35:28.320 --> 35:32.640
A society with strong self-defense rights, the reason America has the second amendment

35:32.640 --> 35:35.800
in the first place, it all sits atop of property ownership.

35:35.800 --> 35:39.800
If you're a serf working for a lord or alternatively living in an Amazon wage cage, you don't

35:39.800 --> 35:42.680
give a shit about the property because it's not your property and its defense falls not

35:42.680 --> 35:43.880
to you but to its owners.

35:43.880 --> 35:47.580
But that house, that homestead, that business, it's yours.

35:47.580 --> 35:52.080
On the emotional side of things, there's a certain pride in being able to stand on

35:52.080 --> 35:56.440
your own two feet and say, no matter what good or bad comes my way, this is my place

35:56.440 --> 35:57.440
and I'm responsible for it.

35:57.440 --> 36:01.920
On the practical side, a society that has no self-defense rights is one that must rely

36:01.920 --> 36:04.280
on heavy state involvement for defense.

36:04.280 --> 36:08.800
This is costly, inefficient, and often tyrannical towards those people who are being defended.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.080
A property owner is incentivized to protect their property with their weapons.

36:12.080 --> 36:17.000
It doesn't matter how much a dumbfuck Marxist says, under no circumstances, if property

36:17.000 --> 36:19.840
rights go, self-defense rights go right along with it.

36:19.840 --> 36:23.080
If you want a further exploration of this idea, I would recommend Krauts video on the

36:23.080 --> 36:27.720
origins of American gun culture and its sequel, the discussion of the Mexican-American border.

36:27.720 --> 36:31.280
And just because the ideal is to ultimately move away from the rent-away-your-whole-life

36:31.280 --> 36:36.200
model and get some skin in the property game, this doesn't make landlords evil.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.980
Landlords do indeed provide a service.

36:37.980 --> 36:41.120
They bear the burden of the legal red tape of property ownership.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.960
They're responsible for repairs and upkeep, not you.

36:43.960 --> 36:46.120
And that is what you rent in exchange.

36:46.120 --> 36:49.640
Simply living in a place doesn't mean that you should own it, regardless of what breadtubers

36:49.640 --> 36:50.640
might say.

36:50.640 --> 36:54.840
In fact, I guarantee you every single popular breadtuber out there makes way more than their

36:54.840 --> 36:55.880
landlords do.

36:55.880 --> 36:59.960
Which is why philosophy tubes call for a rent strike, even as that channel's Patreon income

36:59.960 --> 37:02.460
is set to private, is all the more onerous.

37:02.460 --> 37:03.640
But I've done a video on that already.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.640
You know what?

37:04.640 --> 37:07.600
To be honest, it must suck if you're a breadtube fanboy.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.200
Breadtube doesn't really care about black people outside of what BLM can do for them.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.800
They don't really care about trans people outside of what the trans activists can do

37:12.800 --> 37:13.800
for them.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.440
They're cool with women and femboys because they can be sexual predators, I guess.

37:16.440 --> 37:19.240
The only thing remaining that the breadtuber can actually talk about is class conflict

37:19.240 --> 37:20.340
and material conditions.

37:20.340 --> 37:24.020
And their content on these topics isn't rooted in any sort of knowledge, wisdom, or evidence,

37:24.020 --> 37:26.780
but instead in a broad feeling that people are suffering and something must be done to

37:26.780 --> 37:27.780
help them.

37:27.780 --> 37:30.860
That's not nothing, but it's not enough to build an entire philosophy around.

37:30.860 --> 37:34.140
It's gotta suck to throw away all that wokeness and redefined intersectionality to

37:34.140 --> 37:37.780
be radlib shit and not real leftism because it's all about being a part of the dirtbag

37:37.780 --> 37:41.220
left right now, and then have the only thing that you can really fall back on is a complete

37:41.220 --> 37:44.020
lack of economic knowledge, stemming from the fact that the only actual studying of

37:44.020 --> 37:47.700
the topic that Breadtube does is reading Twitter trending tags about Marxist analysis, which

37:47.700 --> 37:50.500
is already rapidly becoming outdated back when it was being written.

37:50.500 --> 37:55.280
I'd like to thank not only The Three Stooges, whose content I've reviewed for this video,

37:55.280 --> 38:00.040
but also Anna Kasparian for being Cenk's token Armenian, and Sargon, Vee, Destiny,

38:00.040 --> 38:02.960
and Kraut for some of the resources I used in my own analysis.

38:02.960 --> 38:06.260
And of course, I'd like to thank everybody who supports me on Patreon or Subscribestar,

38:06.260 --> 38:09.300
to everybody who's a member on YouTube or a sub on Twitch, thank you very much for keeping

38:09.300 --> 38:10.300
this content flowing.

38:10.300 --> 38:14.360
Here's the scoop guys, tomorrow, June 8th, is my birthday, and that 100,000 YouTube sub

38:14.360 --> 38:16.720
mark would be an excellent milestone for that day, wouldn't it?

38:16.720 --> 38:19.340
Please consider spreading my channel and this video around to your friends, it would be

38:19.340 --> 38:20.340
highly appreciated.

38:20.340 --> 38:24.840
I would also like to announce that on my gaming channel over on Twitch, twitch.tv slash gameboomers,

38:24.840 --> 38:28.880
I intend to start doing a series of E3 streams over the coming week, the schedule for which

38:28.880 --> 38:30.180
is currently on screen.

38:30.180 --> 38:33.080
Please consider dropping in and watching the conferences and announcements with me, as

38:33.080 --> 38:35.580
I guarantee it will be a hilarious trainwreck.

38:35.580 --> 38:39.960
I will continue to try and work on SFO videos during my downtime, but please be patient,

38:39.960 --> 38:43.480
as during E3 every year, I make gameboomers my first priority.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.160
And you know what, that's actually starting to pay off.

38:45.160 --> 38:47.780
I am just a hair away from making Twitch partner.

38:47.780 --> 38:51.260
So as I mentioned, please consider supporting me over there and spreading those streams

38:51.260 --> 38:52.260
around too.

38:52.260 --> 38:53.260
Alright, I'll see you later.

38:53.260 --> 38:53.760
I love you.
