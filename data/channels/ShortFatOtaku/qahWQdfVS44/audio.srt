1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,820
10.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,120
This might come as a surprise to you, but BreadTube doesn't understand economics.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,480
More specifically, for our purposes today, they don't understand the housing crisis.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,440
If you've been paying attention to the housing market right now, prices of homes everywhere

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,760
are skyrocketing, rents are up, and poor people are feeling the pinch.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,440
Your favorite BreadTubers and online lefty commentators will tell you that capitalism

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,380
is to blame due to its inherently predatory nature, that landlords are parasitic entities

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,380
of evil that need to be guillotined, and that the housing market must be abolished

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,900
for the good of the working class.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,540
To those of us who actually live in reality, there's certainly a housing bubble that's

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,540
inflating right now.

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,580
But maybe you and I can talk about it a bit more seriously than the champagne socialists do.

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,460
Let's start with PhilosophyTube, who has made some absolutely stupid housing takes before.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,340
Yeah, this clip is gonna be starting off strong, but why not?

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:53,700
Thatcher's criterion for responsibility was owning property, and the problem there is

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,260
That is a thing that is mathematically impossible for everyone to do at the same time.

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,620
You cannot have a housing market and no homeless people.

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,780
Because if everybody has secure housing, you cannot sell them housing.

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:13,860
It is quite stunning how somebody can be this monumentally wrong and be this confident about it.

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,660
Demand for housing is not constant over a person's life.

21
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,860
The 18 year old looking for a dorm room, the 20 year old looking for their first apartment

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,620
off campus, the transient worker only in the city for a six month contract, the family

23
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,220
man with three kids who needs a yard and some space, and the retiree whose kids have

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,540
moved away all have different housing needs.

25
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,700
Moreover, the existence of the market mechanism to determine the value of housing isn't what

26
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,140
causes homelessness.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,280
That is an incredibly one dimensional take.

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,100
If you just gave everybody housing through a state program, and then used state force

29
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,300
to ensure that housing couldn't be traded, what you're doing is simply assigning people

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,980
hovels at gunpoint, and nobody's going to have the option of living anywhere more in

31
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,540
line with their desires because they still cost labour and materials to make.

32
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,820
Only housing a right does not automatically generate infinite houses.

33
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:37,620
Let's apply Philosophy Tube's reasoning to other markets.

34
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,900
A capitalist market distributes things to people who can afford to buy them, but this

35
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,100
fact doesn't necessarily mean that some people will be excluded from that market.

36
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,940
If there's enough supply, and everyone can afford the item, then there's no exclusion

37
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,940
at all.

38
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,980
Philosophy Tube is acting like the market mechanism itself is the problem, and it's

39
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,980
not.

40
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,940
There's a market where everybody can afford the product, like say the cracker market.

41
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,780
Let's say you want to buy a box of crackers.

42
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,980
Cracker companies still make profits even though everybody can afford a box of crackers.

43
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,100
Even a homeless man who panhandles and only has a few bucks can buy a box of crackers.

44
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,360
Therefore exclusion from the market is not necessary to generate profits.

45
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,280
That being said, there are some pretty serious differences between crackers and housing,

46
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,980
and I think actually discussing the topic and not just grandstanding like Philosophy

47
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,340
Tube does might allow us to understand something about the housing crisis.

48
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,860
The first difference is that people don't buy crackers to store them away as an investment.

49
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,380
Crackers are a pretty poor unit of exchange, as they decay relatively quick.

50
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,420
There are some foodstuffs that have seen their value increase due to rarity and novelty,

51
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,140
like old crystal Pepsi or MREs or something, but those are exceptions to the rule.

52
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,980
To contrast, housing is often purchased as an investment, with the expectation the owner

53
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,980
will one day get money back, sometimes more, sometimes less, based on the market.

54
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,700
Housing is not a thing that is purchased to be wholly consumed and then taken off the

55
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,980
market as its consumption literally turns it into shit, like crackers.

56
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,740
It's meant to retain at least some value after you're done using it.

57
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,900
While crackers only have value in their use, housing has value as an asset.

58
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,300
The second difference is that crackers are a product of labor and materials, while houses

59
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,460
have another component, land.

60
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,220
Land is always going to be some form of natural monopoly, there's only so much land in any

61
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,220
given area.

62
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,660
When a location is popular to live in, like say a city, there is a fixed amount of land

63
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,660
there.

64
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,300
And unlike other types of property, labor cannot create more supply of land.

65
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,140
Labor can allow a single unit of land to be used by more people simultaneously, like

66
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,640
you build smaller houses or you construct an apartment building or whatever, but labor

67
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,940
cannot create more units of land.

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,380
Additionally, land is permanent, sinking coastal properties or expensive reclamation projects

69
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,380
notwithstanding.

70
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,840
This is why you can have two purely identical houses in all respects, where one is valued

71
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,780
significantly more in downtown LA and the other significantly less valued in the middle

72
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,780
of Tennessee.

73
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,380
Compare this with crackers.

74
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,080
Crackers can be continually produced with more labor and materials.

75
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,720
If for some reason, crackers suddenly became really trendy among rich people, companies

76
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,020
would create premium luxury crackers with fancy gold labels that make them feel more

77
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,200
exclusive or whatever.

78
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,440
The cracker market can provide ever increasing quality and quantity of crackers to people

79
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,600
who can afford to pay more.

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,380
But you can't do this with land.

81
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,720
The housing crisis is therefore less of a production crisis and more of a land crisis.

82
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
The third and biggest difference, in my opinion, is that crackers have functioning market feedback

83
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,760
while houses don't.

84
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,380
Consider that an avid consumer of crackers can buy a box of crackers every day.

85
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,420
Consider that there are many alternatives to crackers available, different brands, different

86
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:21,200
types of crackers, alternative snack foods like chips or ice cream or fruit, I guess.

87
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,980
Consider that crackers can be created, transported and stored relatively easily.

88
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:28,260
And consider that it's not too hard to tell a good cracker from a bad cracker, whether

89
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,040
that refers to your own personal taste in the cracker type or if the product is damaged

90
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,580
or rotten or something like that.

91
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,800
In this situation, the market feedback mechanisms of capitalism function very well because consumers

92
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,900
have the opportunity to change where they buy crackers, which crackers they buy and

93
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
how much they buy.

94
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,780
And the producers of crackers can respond to the sales data they receive in order to

95
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,180
maximize their business.

96
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,100
This is something that a socialist planned economy can't actually do.

97
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,500
Frederick Hayek described this as the calculation problem.

98
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,140
In a capitalist system, the average consumer doesn't need to be well informed of the

99
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,300
intricacies of the creation and distribution of five competing types of crackers, even

100
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,840
if that information between the five different brands is highly specialized.

101
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,900
Because all of that information shakes out in the price of the crackers, or more specifically,

102
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,320
the price to enjoyment ratio for each consumer.

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,040
Maybe you just want the cheapest cracker and you don't care about quality.

104
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,680
Maybe you want the highest quality cracker.

105
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,400
In that case, it's a reasonable bet that the highest priced crackers are the highest

106
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
quality.

107
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,800
Or maybe you have some specific taste that leads you to buy a niche product and you actually

108
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,840
prefer it over the more higher priced stuff.

109
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,840
I mean, who knows?

110
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,920
The point is, the pricing of an item serves to tell you information about the items generalized

111
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,040
quality, while the sales numbers of that item serves to tell the manufacturers the wishes

112
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
of their customers.

113
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,560
A moneyless communist economy has no way to provide feedback to the manufacturers of goods

114
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,100
and will therefore always be highly inefficient.

115
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,980
Even a market socialist economy will not be able to stimulate genuine competition, as

116
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,300
individuals with local knowledge of local trading practices and markets have no incentive

117
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,320
to share that knowledge with the central planners.

118
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,240
However, even though Hayek's observation of the calculation problem is completely correct,

119
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,300
this doesn't mean that it's functional in every market, and the housing market is

120
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,240
one time where it doesn't work.

121
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,560
Houses are different from crackers.

122
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,140
You may buy a box of crackers a day and then the price to enjoyment ratio will shake out

123
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,900
on its own, but nobody's really buying a house a day unless you're hyper-rich or

124
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,900
something.

125
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,900
The housing market is far more limited.

126
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,940
You're only really comparing highly non-standard products in a specific area that you want

127
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,740
to live, and even then only with the other houses on the market at that time.

128
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,060
Buying a house is complicated, both legally and financially, and a layman will probably

129
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,420
have to employ an agent.

130
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,540
Even standardized housing layouts are going to differ from each other in terms of finishings,

131
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,760
or age, or quality, or location.

132
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,040
Problems with houses are sometimes not easy to discover at the time of purchase, but only

133
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,260
pop up years later.

134
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,300
You cannot know if the experience of living in the house that you're about to buy is

135
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,500
comparable to the experience of living in other houses that are available for sale at

136
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
the same time.

137
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,300
In this market it's much harder for an individual on their own to make a rational, informed

138
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,460
decision about their purchase, necessitating housing inspectors, housing insurance, trust

139
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,800
in real estate agents, and if all else fails, government regulation.

140
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,260
The housing market is one area in which natural pricing feedback mechanisms don't function,

141
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,020
and therefore a purely free market wouldn't work.

142
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,900
I know that libertarians and NCAPs don't like to hear this, but sometimes you guys

143
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,700
are just as wrong as the socialists.

144
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,800
But hey, at least they're not wrong like Philosophy Tube is, whose conclusion sounds

145
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
a bit like this.

146
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,300
And if it's already canon that people can have their property expropriated for a new

147
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,100
mall, it's surely not that much of a leak to say they could be expropriated so people

148
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,500
could actually live in them?

149
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,180
Only this time the money for that forced buyout would be all the rent that's already been

150
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,020
paid over the whole time the series has been running.

151
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,820
But uh, Niall, if that's the case, then who owns all the properties?

152
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,220
Well that's the awesome bit.

153
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,860
Nobody does.

154
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
You know what that means?

155
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,580
The character in the comics has a job that they hate or their boss is an asshole or they

156
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,460
need to take time off of work to care for a relative or paint a painting, write a novel,

157
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,340
go on a protest, join a union, get involved in politics.

158
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,340
They can do it!

159
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,920
They can say, screw you, I don't need your job anymore!

160
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,620
Because I don't need to make rent because there is no more rent.

161
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,800
Some fanfiction writers like to imagine that the state could take over some of housing

162
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,080
market's powers but that's kind of already been explored in an alternate universe run

163
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,280
of the comics set in Russia which remains pretty controversial even among fans.

164
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,800
Although another comic book writer called Hugo Chavez wrote his own spinoff series set

165
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,160
in Venezuela where he used the state to recognize small teams of Venezuelan superheroes called

166
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,900
communes and gave them the power to expropriate and administer property.

167
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,800
That left the communes to do their own thing without the state getting too massive and

168
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,680
bureaucratic but still gave those small teams of superheroes some backup and legal legitimacy

169
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,960
when they needed it.

170
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,500
Yeah, apparently landlords should have their property seized, no profit should ever be

171
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,440
gained from owning houses, and control of housing should be devolved into communes.

172
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,200
This is how you get Soviet era style apartment blocks, with communal kitchens and bathrooms

173
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,280
for each floor.

174
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,840
Because since there's no longer any pricing mechanism at all, the resources used must

175
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,840
be allocated as anti-bourgeois as possible at the expense of things like comfort, security,

176
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,040
functionality, and the consent of those who live there.

177
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,120
This inevitably leads to the same live in the pod mentality we're seeing come out

178
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
of LA right now.

179
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,840
The only difference is that the Soviet version comes in 50 different shades of grey instead

180
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,520
of rainbow colored paradoxically.

181
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,640
In Philosophy Tube's system, who decides to build new houses?

182
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,060
Where does labor and materials for those houses come from?

183
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,160
Who owns these houses and what rights do they have?

184
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
In the end it can only be the state.

185
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,160
In this regard there's no difference between libertarian and authoritarian leftism.

186
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Those people who call themselves libertarian socialists must by necessity behave like Stalinists,

187
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,480
because those people who build houses still need to be paid, and they still need to receive

188
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,320
feedback from the desires of their customers in order to allocate their resources efficiently.

189
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,560
Without that they end up being forced to build a bunch of shit that nobody really wants and

190
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,360
will go entirely unused, like China's empty cities, unless the state forces people into

191
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,120
them like the Soviet Union did.

192
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,500
Another person who has a pretty awful take on this topic is unlearning economics, which

193
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,140
I found surprising because generally he's pretty insightful, at least for a socialist,

194
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,420
and his criticism of Philosophy Tube hits a few of the same points that mine does.

195
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,260
He released a video titled The Death of Economics 101, where he tackles a number of different

196
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,800
topics, including the housing crisis.

197
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,860
This time the subtopic is rent control.

198
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,180
Rent control is when government regulation artificially lowers the price of rent below

199
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,900
what the market can bear, in an effort to provide low income housing to poor people.

200
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,020
However, in my opinion rent control lowers the quality and the quantity of rents available.

201
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,320
Here's my hunch.

202
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,820
Unlike all products in a free market, supply and demand for rental units eventually reach

203
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,820
an equilibrium.

204
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,540
But because rent control targets a specific type of property and artificially lowers its

205
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,040
price below that equilibrium, we should be able to observe a few effects.

206
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,020
First, new buildings that will be constructed will likely be of a type not subject to that

207
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,920
rent control, and so the supply of non-rent controlled units will rise accordingly.

208
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,200
Secondly, old buildings that are covered by rent control will be converted into other

209
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,680
types of property if it's profitable to do so, lowering the supply of the controlled

210
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
units.

211
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,760
Thirdly, there will be cases where it might be better for the landlord to simply destroy

212
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,000
the property or keep it empty, if the rent control is severe enough.

213
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,400
And finally, maintenance on the controlled locations will be less frequent, due to less

214
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,400
resources the landlord has to perform them, leading to a slow decline in quality over

215
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
time.

216
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,320
In other words, long term rent control should cause the quality and quantity of rental units

217
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
to decrease.

218
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,520
And learning economics as a counterpoint to this, is that the reduction of quantity is

219
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,780
not in the supply of housing, but in the supply of housing specifically used for renting.

220
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:11,340
The supply and demand for houses should balance, with rents at R-star and quantity at Q-star.

221
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,500
What does rent control do in this situation?

222
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,420
It's represented by the horizontal line RC, which forces rents down.

223
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:24,020
At this low rental rate, the quantity of houses supplied is lower than the previous equilibrium,

224
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,300
even though more people want to rent.

225
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,540
We have a shortage, and a fall in rented units compared to the free market.

226
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,100
The blanket opposition to rent control that derives from this is hugely overstated.

227
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,980
I would contend that the supply demand model can mislead people into thinking that the

228
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,580
reduction is in housing supply, rather than the number of houses specifically used for

229
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,580
renting.

230
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,600
Maybe I'm an idiot, but I don't see how that's a meaningful difference.

231
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,660
In fact, I think that's the point of the criticism of rent control.

232
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,880
It means that there's less places for people to rent.

233
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,020
Like here, let's assume that you've got a bunch of mid-range houses that private owners

234
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,280
want to rent, but rent control makes it more profitable to sell them.

235
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,220
Suddenly there's a bunch of new houses on the market.

236
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,180
Maybe the extra supply causes the price of these houses to drop a little bit, and maybe

237
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,180
a middle-class family that couldn't afford that house right away can now do so instead

238
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,700
of having to wait another year or two.

239
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,940
That is a good short-term benefit, but the lowest classes, the people who would never

240
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,300
be able to afford that house and must rent it, they suffer because the landlords can

241
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,020
no longer afford to rent it to them.

242
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,180
It's kind of like minimum wage.

243
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,940
It might help some people in the middle, but those at the bottom suffer disproportionately,

244
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,700
as they are priced out of the market due to an external force fixing the variables.

245
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,200
And speaking of minimum wage, Unlearning Economics shows the IGM Chicago polls on rent control,

246
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,000
but he doesn't show the IGM Chicago polls during his minimum wage part of this video,

247
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,120
which would have massively weakened his minimum wage arguments, but that's for another time.

248
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,600
Next up, Unlearning Economics brings up an article about how rent control ruined the

249
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,960
Berlin rental economy.

250
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,280
A paper on the phenomenon, unfortunately only available in German, shows that rents for

251
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,380
the controlled locations plummeted, as is to be expected.

252
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,220
But there's no discussion on whether or not these were rental units held by people who

253
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,400
actually needed that relief.

254
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,700
For example, a person making six figures while living in a hole on a wall with five other

255
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,700
guys for a year so he can save up money and launch a startup or buy a house or something.

256
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,800
He certainly doesn't need the relief of rent control, but a poor family with no other option

257
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,420
but to live in that location might actually need that help.

258
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,600
But also, rent controlled apartments ended up being worth less in sale value, and as

259
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,940
expected, the value and rents of their uncontrolled counterparts skyrocketed.

260
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,500
The supply of controlled units dropped by 50%, while the supply of uncontrolled units

261
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,100
shot up disproportionately over 100%.

262
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,620
And Unlearning Economics's response is to say that these things are good, and that the

263
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,960
article he's reading is just crap?

264
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,300
As you're all now budding natural experiment enthusiasts, I know what you're going to ask.

265
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,740
Is there any more credible evidence than this crap on rent control?

266
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,520
This isn't a reply, man.

267
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,020
Rent control seems to have some short-term good effects for some slice of the population,

268
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,740
but it also seems to have long-term bad effects for everybody except the ultra-rich.

269
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,620
Unlearning Economics then talks about a study conducted on rent control in San Francisco

270
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,180
in 1994, where a recent city policy saw that old units were rent controlled, while newly

271
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,460
built units were not.

272
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:03,180
He says that this paper claims the policy led to a 15% reduction in total rental units

273
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,180
available.

274
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:10,180
What the paper actually claims, what he presents on screen in his own video, is that 7.2% of

275
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,620
rent controlled properties underwent renovations to evade rent control but still remained on

276
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:20,020
the market as non-rent controlled units, while 8.1% of rent controlled units were sold to

277
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,540
owner-occupants, meaning the new owner decided to live in the property themselves rather

278
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,660
than rent it out, taking it off the rental market.

279
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,060
The paper's abstract restates these effects as well.

280
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,380
Rent control limited renters' mobility by 20%.

281
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,020
15% of rent controlled units were either sold to people intending to live in them directly

282
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,740
or redeveloped by landlords to become non-controlled units but still available for rent.

283
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,300
And while rent control prevents displacement of renters in the short-term, long-term it

284
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,260
drove rent prices up across the entire market.

285
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:55,300
He also says that a specific graph from this paper shows rents fell, but look at it.

286
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,780
It says renters, not rents, people renting, not price of renting.

287
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,860
The number of people renting a rent controlled unit fell at the same rate as rent controlled

288
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:07,980
units were sold or converted into higher priced, non-rent controlled counterparts.

289
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,180
In other words, those landlords who either found it more profitable to renovate or sell

290
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,000
the property or could no longer afford to keep renting at the new controlled rate had

291
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,980
a higher chance of just folding and so the tenant suffered.

292
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,860
Paying a rent that's bankrupting you is certainly bad, but being entirely priced out

293
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,240
of the market is worse.

294
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,840
The problem isn't necessarily that inequality is bad, after all we all know that inequality

295
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,660
is required for innovation or production to actually happen.

296
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,120
The problem is that extreme inequality has a snowballing effect into other areas of society,

297
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,380
and that rent control is a force that exacerbates those other effects.

298
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,200
The paper suggests that one of these knock-on effects is that middle class people are less

299
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,760
and less likely to move into a rent controlled area.

300
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,540
It turns out that a rent controlled neighborhood ends up containing only homeless people until

301
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,400
they migrate away or get arrested or something, those few middle class people who did actually

302
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,060
snag a good housing deal and the ultra wealthy.

303
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,240
And if the majority of an area is wealthy, the other non-housing amenities in that area

304
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,840
will also see their prices rise.

305
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,400
In other words, the demand for high priced, high quality goods from upscale stores will

306
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,760
outpace the demand for low priced, low quality goods sold at Walmart or Dollar Tree, and

307
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,880
eventually those people living in rent controlled housing will only be able to afford their

308
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,240
rent and nothing else in their area.

309
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,860
In essence, if some suburb or sub-community is a highly priced bubble, with its internal

310
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,900
economy being quite expensive, a rent control law does serve to increase lower class access

311
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,900
to that location.

312
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,400
But the long term effects of this is that those people who gained access will rapidly

313
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,940
find themselves priced out of not only their own neighborhoods, but surrounding neighborhoods

314
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,260
as well, because this sort of unearned access has knock-on effects in the larger economy.

315
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,320
The 1994 San Francisco paper ends by stating that rent control has contributed to gentrification

316
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,220
by simultaneously bringing in higher income residents while preventing the displacement

317
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,220
of minorities.

318
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,060
And here's how Unlearning Economics replies to this.

319
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,060
Keeping existing residents in the area while rich residents join is a bad thing.

320
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,980
The solution is obviously to have only rich residents so the income inequality in the

321
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,980
area is low.

322
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,260
In his defence, it's hard to see this effect as it's not always visible.

323
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,060
But a big problem with rent control is what I mentioned earlier.

324
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,380
There will always be people who would move into the community and contribute to it, but

325
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,060
now do not because rent controlled units are over consumed due to the lower price and the

326
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,020
additional housing stock being created will be overpriced for them.

327
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,220
The supply goes down, costs go up, and now you've got an entire class of people who

328
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,260
aren't moving in while rich people can still afford the area, increasing the inequality

329
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,900
you're aiming to fight with your regulation.

330
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,420
Unlearning Economics ends his talk like this.

331
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,880
So it's bad when existing tenants stay but also bad when they leave?

332
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,740
Gentrification is good but also bad?

333
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,560
I found this paper quite confusing, and it seems to be a go-to reference for opponents

334
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,740
of rent control.

335
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,700
With such a variety of competing effects, the authors eventually conclude that the overall

336
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,060
effects of rent control are a wash.

337
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,340
And he's just lying to you.

338
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,260
The paper does not state the effects of rent control are a wash.

339
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,860
Instead, the paper states that the beneficiaries of rent control are more likely to remain

340
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,200
at their current location because they're getting a good deal, that rent control disproportionately

341
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,380
helps minorities as well as people who have a longer history at their current location,

342
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,380
and that on the flip side, non-controlled areas saw people cycling through their rental

343
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,460
units faster, as both landlords and tenants try to get better deals.

344
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,580
They also found that landlords avoid rent control by converting rental units to condos

345
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,700
or by renovating the building to avoid regulation.

346
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,900
The reduction in low-cost rent supply, as well as the new availability of high-cost

347
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,240
rent supply, or condos and houses for sale, ultimately created a housing market geared

348
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,020
more towards higher-income individuals in the long term.

349
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,660
This is not a wash, this is a failure of the policy.

350
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,400
The last video we'll talk about today is Hassan's, and his is probably the funniest

351
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,060
of all, because to be honest Hassan is a joke, it's 30 minutes of him whining about not

352
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
being able to buy a house.

353
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,920
The video title is correct, but he brings to the table a simple explanation for all

354
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,380
of these things, filtered through his own political lens.

355
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,620
I hope he actually paid the editor of this video this time.

356
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:31,340
Hassan doesn't understand that the value of a house is largely dependent on the value

357
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,220
of other houses in the same area on the market.

358
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,160
This is a complex formulation that takes into account location, house quality, willingness

359
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,680
to sell, but it's not nearly as simple as Hassan makes it out to be.

360
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,920
Like if there's 10 comparable houses on the same street, and they all get listed,

361
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,280
and the first one goes for way over asking price, the others probably will too.

362
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:55,760
It's really funny listening to Hassan complain about these numbers, knowing how much he makes,

363
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,080
this is not a problem for him.

364
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,960
This is what breadtubers do when they try their hand in economic analysis, you know.

365
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,680
They shit all over one side of an economic transaction, and ignore the other side because

366
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
that's all they're interested in.

367
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,060
Right now people selling their homes are making a killing, they're doing very well, but people

368
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,120
like Hassan only care about the buyers of homes that are getting fucked over.

369
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,720
Meanwhile when it comes to the buyers of labour right now, they're having to jack up wages

370
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,360
because no one wants to actually work for minimum wage during this climate, and these

371
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,380
same breadtubers complaining about the difficulty of buying homes are laughing at the difficulty

372
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,680
of buying labour, simply because it suits their politics and the targets are acceptable

373
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
to them.

374
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,280
The actual truth is, both of these things can be negative if pushed too far.

375
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,400
Upward pressure on wages can certainly be a bad thing, you know, probably not yet, but

376
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,880
if it was like $50 an hour for a burger flipper job or something, absolutely.

377
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,880
Same with housing.

378
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,240
But Hassan only cares about the buyer's side of the housing equation, just like he only

379
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,320
cares about the seller's side of the labour equation, because he doesn't actually care

380
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,120
about the damage done by his idealized policies, he only cares if the correct people are hurt

381
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,400
The house itself is a depreciating asset.

382
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,420
The land, on the other hand, is an appreciating asset, especially when you're purchasing land

383
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,640
in like fucking Los Angeles, in like a really good area of Los Angeles.

384
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,640
I don't know why Hassan thinks houses are depreciating assets, they're not quite like

385
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
cars, you know.

386
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,560
Yeah there's maintenance, but houses can absolutely appreciate over time depending on the market.

387
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:15,380
Like hedge funds are straight up purchasing as much, as many houses as they fucking can,

388
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,140
so that they can turn around and start renting it to people, so they can become landlords.

389
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:25,520
Which ironically creates a system where buying a house is unaffordable for most average Joe's,

390
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,160
so they are stuck renting forever.

391
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:34,900
So it is a problem that basically creates another opportunity for, you know, these hedge

392
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,980
funds to make more money.

393
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,380
It's not just fucking hedge funds buying up all the houses and renting them to people.

394
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,900
This is like a child's take on housing.

395
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,780
And that's not to say it's not happening in some places, it certainly is a little bit.

396
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,100
You've got a massive crash during COVID, the value of everybody's property went down, businesses

397
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,780
closed up, etc, etc, and the people who made a killing are the ones who vacuumed up property

398
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,980
when they were at COVID lows, because that property value will inevitably bounce back.

399
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,340
That's not the only variable here.

400
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,740
What's also happening is, now that lockdowns are coming to a close in a lot of places,

401
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,860
you've got tons of people moving, whether that be out of cities or back closer to work

402
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,460
as work at home ends, you've got a historically low interest rate on mortgages, you've got

403
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,060
many potential sellers shelving their plans due to uncertainty, you've got many potential

404
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,540
buyers who have reduced their incidental spending due to lockdowns while working at home and

405
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,420
saving money or taking pay raises for outside essential work.

406
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,280
This has all resulted with more buyers having more money and less sellers willing to sell.

407
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,040
It's not just opportunistic rich people monopolistically buying everything.

408
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:32,820
It might sound cool when your dad makes, you know, 100,000 above asking price on his fucking

409
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,660
house, but it's not going to be so great when he can't find another house to purchase.

410
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:41,020
And that's the reality when people are leaving California, they're not leaving California

411
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
because of taxes.

412
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,580
That's a lie.

413
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,860
It's poor people leaving California because they can't afford to live in California, so

414
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,620
they fucking go somewhere else.

415
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,140
They simply cannot afford to rent or even purchase a home.

416
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,260
Here's one thing that sounds actually correct about it's not about taxes.

417
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,940
It might be for corporations, it might be for business owners, people who can work from

418
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,300
literally anywhere, but it's not for the average person.

419
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,620
Average people don't make nearly as many decisions based on taxes as we think they do.

420
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,660
It's highly unlikely that you'll choose a job or a place to live based on the marginal

421
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,980
tax rate of the area in most situations.

422
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,220
It's okay if people are priced out of some market, Sasan.

423
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,300
Not everybody has to live in California.

424
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,420
Stop looking down on what you coastal elites call flyover states.

425
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,380
That dude who called you a snob in your own chat and you got insulted by it?

426
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,140
You just fucking proved him right.

427
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,620
Motherfuckers that are finally able to afford a home because they have like an amount of

428
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,540
capital that they've accrued over the course of the fucking pandemic are so fucked when

429
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,540
basically they're not able to refinance, when basically they realize that the investment

430
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,980
property that they purchased and now that they're stuck with is not going to hold its

431
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,100
value, especially if they fucking bought it in some random area that is not slated to

432
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,860
appreciate to the goddamn moon like you would in certain parts of California, like in fucking

433
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Los Angeles.

434
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
And then they're fucked.

435
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,660
And even if they are able to refinance at that point, the interest rates are going to

436
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
be higher.

437
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:04,860
So no matter what their refinance works, now they have a property that's value is lower

438
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,660
that you're absolutely stuck with.

439
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,260
Didn't you just say that hedge funds are buying up everything and making a killing

440
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,420
and renting it all out to people and turning us all into serfs?

441
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,700
But now people who buy homes are fucked because they won't be valuable?

442
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,740
Would that also affect the hedge funds?

443
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,740
You can really tell when somebody is making an analysis based on ideology and not on the

444
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,740
facts.

445
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,580
I'm still so mad that like I lost the dream house that I literally found.

446
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,380
It was like the second house I went to and it was my dream house.

447
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,240
It was still of course expensive, obviously above like what the market rate would be for

448
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
something like that.

449
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,300
But it was affordable in comparison to like all these other fucking places I've seen.

450
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,300
And I lost it.

451
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
And it fucking sucks.

452
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,220
I was going to have a pool boys.

453
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,220
It's the second.

454
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,220
Okay, dude.

455
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,220
Listen, it'll be fine.

456
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,300
It's not your it's not your dream house.

457
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,940
I'm sure there are other fish in the sea.

458
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,480
This is definitely like a first time home buyers story, isn't it?

459
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,160
It was my dream house, dude, your Hassan.

460
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Just just buy it.

461
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
You have the money.

462
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
Pay for it.

463
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,720
Like this is a rich guy coming into a poor neighborhood, talking to a poor homeowner

464
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,440
complaining that he sold his house to another guy who's also poor, just pay the fucking

465
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
price dude.

466
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,320
Hassan is so angry.

467
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,120
He couldn't fuck a dude out of his house.

468
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,520
Like what is his solution here?

469
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,440
Should he have been able to force the seller to sell him that at the lower price?

470
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Like what does he want?

471
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:24,600
Sold for 78% over asking, it was listed at $1 million, it's over 2.12, a three bedroom

472
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,920
three bathroom in fucking Mount Washington.

473
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,520
It's actually kind of cool though.

474
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
Holy shit.

475
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,200
Hassan is looking at one of the richest areas in the world.

476
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,720
Are you seriously talking like these, these secluded stately mansions are somehow relevant

477
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,320
to the wider housing market?

478
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,640
Are you actually complaining that you can't pay like 300, $500 a month or something and

479
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,320
live in some woodland compound?

480
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,480
Is the US running out of houses?

481
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,360
The housing shortage conversation is kind of bullshit.

482
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
And here's why.

483
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,080
There are so many vacant fucking properties, dude.

484
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,760
There are so many vacant properties.

485
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,680
It actually is because inventory is historically low.

486
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,780
That is the main driver of the situation.

487
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,920
We are at the lowest point in history for housing availability.

488
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,380
Anna Kasparian had a shit take about this subject recently.

489
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:19,160
She tweeted, America is short of homes as a strange focus when foreign capital and private

490
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,680
equity funds are snatching up all available housing for their portfolios.

491
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm sick of hearing about the shortage of housing as homes owned by people who don't

492
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,640
even live in the US sit empty.

493
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,560
And that does happen sometimes, but the problem with this point of view that rich people are

494
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,380
buying homes and keeping them vacant and that's the driver of the housing crisis and therefore

495
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,280
we shouldn't have to worry about building new homes is that it's ultimately a counterproductive

496
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,280
view.

497
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,180
One, most vacancies aren't where people want to live.

498
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,480
The highest vacancy rates in the United States are in low demand places.

499
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,680
Of course, the lowest vacancy rates are on the West Coast and in the Northeast.

500
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,880
Telling somebody in the Bay Area that there's an abandoned house in Detroit they can move

501
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,320
to isn't really a solution to their problem.

502
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,680
Two, vacancies aren't all the same.

503
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,580
Census data shows us that 50% of all vacancies are called market vacancies, which is a term

504
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,480
describing the inevitable gaps in tenancy that can occur when a lease ends.

505
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,960
Sometimes there's trouble finding new tenants, sometimes a deal falls through last minute,

506
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
sometimes there's repairs to be done, whatever.

507
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,040
Landlords lose money when a home is vacant and they're already incentivized by the market

508
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,720
for these market vacancies to be as short as possible.

509
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,220
Three, landlords love low vacancy rates because it gives them much more market power.

510
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,140
If somebody shows up in their neighborhood and builds a bunch of new rental units, the

511
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,200
vacancy rate goes up, competition goes up, rents go down, and the power of currently

512
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,900
existing landlords over the market goes down as well.

513
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,940
Not building new units strengthens the position of those currently existing landlords, while

514
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,420
building more homes opens the market to further competition pressure.

515
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,980
Four, a vacancy rate of zero is disastrous.

516
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,700
You would not be able to ever move into a new location because there would be no available

517
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,700
locations at all.

518
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,700
Kids moving to their own place?

519
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,220
Nope, they got to stay at home.

520
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
Immigrants?

521
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
Nowhere for them to go.

522
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,020
Low vacancies means that if you want to move, you have to trade houses with somebody else,

523
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,880
while the existence of at least some vacancies allows for market fluidity.

524
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,400
The problem with the current housing crisis is there's no easy solution.

525
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,660
All the dumb shit that breadtubers say equate to entitled whining that just makes things

526
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,340
far worse than they already are.

527
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,840
But because land is a constant rather than a variable means that we will always have

528
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,220
this problem in the most costly cities on earth.

529
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,580
No matter what, not everybody can live in downtown LA or on Manhattan Island, and that's

530
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,580
that.

531
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,580
There's just not enough space.

532
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,580
But that's okay.

533
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,020
It's okay if people are priced out of certain locations.

534
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,660
Not everybody has to live in a megacity, and forcing yourself into a tin can to stay in

535
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,820
Southern California isn't really good for you.

536
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,900
Driving on the highway to and from your job every day, cramped in your car, breathing

537
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,180
in the city's smog because you want to live in the place to be, is probably the biggest,

538
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,820
most dumb fuck way you can waste your life.

539
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,020
Let's say you work for ten years, commuting two hours a day.

540
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,360
You're going to end up in your thirties with chronic and curable back pain, a lot less

541
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,900
money than you should have, and if you properly used that time you wasted in your car, you

542
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,820
could have become masterclass at some skill or hobby.

543
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,780
I have the right to live in LA, shut up, no you don't.

544
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,700
Millennials and Zoomers have this feeling that Metropolis is the only place you should

545
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,800
aspire to end up, that hometowns are places to be moved on from and be embarrassed by,

546
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,300
and they're rapidly discovering that even though the city has its amenities, it doesn't

547
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,300
have community.

548
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,060
I think this is why progs throw around the community as a label so much, they don't

549
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,480
actually fucking know what it means.

550
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,060
My generation spent so much time considering their small town origins as a waiting room,

551
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,760
feeling some indescribable pull towards the rootlessness of city life, and its revolving

552
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,960
door of new people, new experiences, and new locations, that a lot of millennials who

553
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,320
are now in their thirties are finding themselves lonely and not actually able to understand

554
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
why.

555
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,320
But here's why.

556
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,760
The transient nature of that lifestyle, the in-betweenness that's so appealing, ultimately

557
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,520
leaves you with nothing solid to stand on.

558
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,920
I can't find the article at the time of writing this script, I'm sure I'll be able to put

559
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,400
it on the screen and post, about a journalist who is having a farewell get together at the

560
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,120
bar for a colleague who was moving to Hong Kong for a new job back in early 2020.

561
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,920
I'm sure that probably turned out not to be a good career move, actually.

562
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,460
But the point is, among the transients, the in-betweens, there's no sense of community.

563
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,640
There's no neighborhood.

564
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,420
There's no family you get to know next door as your kids grow up together.

565
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,020
You've got your work colleagues, whom you only talk to about work, and whom you only

566
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,520
get along with when you're drinking.

567
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,760
And there's no guarantee that connection will remain when they suddenly fly off, leaving

568
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,760
nothing behind.

569
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,400
They don't really care about you, and you don't really care about them.

570
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,680
Your life path simply happened to align for a little while.

571
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,720
It doesn't have to be this way.

572
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,800
Even living in a city, it doesn't have to be this way.

573
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,640
But there's certainly something about a specific type of city living that makes people

574
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,160
think that they're disposable and treat others as if they were disposable in return.

575
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,720
It's no surprise to me that millennials and zoomers are having trouble forming lasting

576
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
relationships.

577
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,440
I'm not saying that everybody has to return to tradition and live in the same house they

578
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,080
grew up in, or farm on some homestead with five acres or whatever.

579
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,260
You can live in some suburb half an hour outside of downtown and maintain a sense of community

580
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,260
just fine.

581
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,260
I'm saying that embracing a lifestyle that prioritizes novelty over connection, that

582
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,960
values width over depth, will ultimately make you unhappy.

583
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,960
And that lifestyle is uniquely incentivized by city living.

584
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,360
These are people who think that their real life will finally start once they move, ignoring

585
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,240
the fact that their life is already passing them by right now as they wait, failing to

586
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,000
realize that even if they manage to do more, they're still the same person with the same

587
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
baggage.

588
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
This is just armchair psychology for me, but I think the reason they do it is because they

589
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
have big dreams.

590
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,880
And rather than knuckling down and doing the work right now, it's easy to keep the looming

591
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,920
failure at arm's length by saying that they have to move to the big city before they can

592
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,980
really get going.

593
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,360
Or if they're already in the big city, they have to move to the next spot.

594
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,640
A lot of people have been messaging me recently about Georgism as a solution to the land problem.

595
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,620
A philosophy created by Henry George, Georgism is the belief that people should own the value

596
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,600
they produce themselves, both in labor and in trade.

597
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,240
Meaning no income taxes, no trade taxes, no purchase taxes.

598
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,520
But that because land will always be some level of natural monopoly, the economic value

599
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,240
derived from the land itself and its natural resources should be taxed.

600
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,880
In other words, if you own a business and generate profit, it shouldn't be taxed.

601
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,480
If you build a house, that shouldn't be taxed.

602
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,520
But the land your business or house sits on should be taxed, as should any resources you

603
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,160
pull from the natural world, like water or minerals.

604
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,440
The logic is you may have created your house or your business, either directly with your

605
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,800
labor or indirectly by working elsewhere and then paying for it, but you didn't create

606
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,400
the land or its resources.

607
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,840
That was provided by nature.

608
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,120
It holds its value because of society and therefore a land tax rather than a capital

609
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,700
or labor tax should be what funds the government.

610
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,840
Many economists since the days of Adam Smith have noted that unlike all other forms of

611
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:11,000
taxation, a land tax doesn't create economic inefficiency like the minimum wage or generate

612
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,840
holes in the market like rent control.

613
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,080
And modern experiments seem to bear this out.

614
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,360
Queensland, Australia ran a land tax experiment and the results seem to show that it had little

615
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,300
effect on the price of housing, but it did increase the total number of houses for sale.

616
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,940
The land tax was seen by Karl Marx as a method that would alleviate the working class's woes,

617
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,320
but ultimately rejected it as it would prevent a transition to a socialist economy.

618
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,260
At the same time, Milton Friedman described the land tax as the least bad tax since it

619
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,300
only targets what individuals did not create with their labor and it imposes little burden

620
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,500
on economic activity.

621
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,340
If you can get these two guys to begrudgingly agree that the idea is a good one and the

622
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:49,100
only reason they don't like it is because it doesn't square away with their pet projects,

623
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,980
you've probably got something special on your hands.

624
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,500
To be honest, I don't know how I feel about Georgism.

625
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,740
I had to begin reading up on it specifically for this video and my opinion isn't fully

626
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,740
formed yet.

627
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,100
At face value, it seems alright.

628
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,540
I know something that's commonly advocated for nowadays is a use tax, meaning that if

629
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,240
you own property but you're just sitting on it and not putting it to use, you should

630
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
be taxed for it.

631
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,600
Considering the current problem in Vancouver, for example, where Chinese nationals want

632
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,580
to hide money from the Chinese Communist Party and do so by buying Canadian homes and then

633
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,440
simply letting them sit around empty because they don't want to go through the hassle

634
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,940
of renting them to people, I can see why this sort of use tax is becoming appealing.

635
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,880
But as long as there's an impetus to own your own property, this will always be a problem.

636
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,120
And no, the solution isn't to tell people that they'll own nothing and be happy or

637
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,320
to live in the pod and eat the bugs and rent forever.

638
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,640
A society with strong self-defense rights, the reason America has the second amendment

639
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,800
in the first place, it all sits atop of property ownership.

640
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,800
If you're a serf working for a lord or alternatively living in an Amazon wage cage, you don't

641
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,680
give a shit about the property because it's not your property and its defense falls not

642
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,880
to you but to its owners.

643
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:47,580
But that house, that homestead, that business, it's yours.

644
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,080
On the emotional side of things, there's a certain pride in being able to stand on

645
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,440
your own two feet and say, no matter what good or bad comes my way, this is my place

646
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440
and I'm responsible for it.

647
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,920
On the practical side, a society that has no self-defense rights is one that must rely

648
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,280
on heavy state involvement for defense.

649
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,800
This is costly, inefficient, and often tyrannical towards those people who are being defended.

650
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,080
A property owner is incentivized to protect their property with their weapons.

651
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,000
It doesn't matter how much a dumbfuck Marxist says, under no circumstances, if property

652
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,840
rights go, self-defense rights go right along with it.

653
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,080
If you want a further exploration of this idea, I would recommend Krauts video on the

654
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,720
origins of American gun culture and its sequel, the discussion of the Mexican-American border.

655
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,280
And just because the ideal is to ultimately move away from the rent-away-your-whole-life

656
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,200
model and get some skin in the property game, this doesn't make landlords evil.

657
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,980
Landlords do indeed provide a service.

658
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,120
They bear the burden of the legal red tape of property ownership.

659
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,960
They're responsible for repairs and upkeep, not you.

660
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,120
And that is what you rent in exchange.

661
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,640
Simply living in a place doesn't mean that you should own it, regardless of what breadtubers

662
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
might say.

663
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,840
In fact, I guarantee you every single popular breadtuber out there makes way more than their

664
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,880
landlords do.

665
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,960
Which is why philosophy tubes call for a rent strike, even as that channel's Patreon income

666
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,460
is set to private, is all the more onerous.

667
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,640
But I've done a video on that already.

668
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
You know what?

669
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,600
To be honest, it must suck if you're a breadtube fanboy.

670
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,200
Breadtube doesn't really care about black people outside of what BLM can do for them.

671
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,800
They don't really care about trans people outside of what the trans activists can do

672
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
for them.

673
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,440
They're cool with women and femboys because they can be sexual predators, I guess.

674
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,240
The only thing remaining that the breadtuber can actually talk about is class conflict

675
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,340
and material conditions.

676
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,020
And their content on these topics isn't rooted in any sort of knowledge, wisdom, or evidence,

677
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,780
but instead in a broad feeling that people are suffering and something must be done to

678
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,780
help them.

679
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,860
That's not nothing, but it's not enough to build an entire philosophy around.

680
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,140
It's gotta suck to throw away all that wokeness and redefined intersectionality to

681
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,780
be radlib shit and not real leftism because it's all about being a part of the dirtbag

682
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,220
left right now, and then have the only thing that you can really fall back on is a complete

683
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,020
lack of economic knowledge, stemming from the fact that the only actual studying of

684
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,700
the topic that Breadtube does is reading Twitter trending tags about Marxist analysis, which

685
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,500
is already rapidly becoming outdated back when it was being written.

686
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,280
I'd like to thank not only The Three Stooges, whose content I've reviewed for this video,

687
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,040
but also Anna Kasparian for being Cenk's token Armenian, and Sargon, Vee, Destiny,

688
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,960
and Kraut for some of the resources I used in my own analysis.

689
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,260
And of course, I'd like to thank everybody who supports me on Patreon or Subscribestar,

690
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,300
to everybody who's a member on YouTube or a sub on Twitch, thank you very much for keeping

691
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,300
this content flowing.

692
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,360
Here's the scoop guys, tomorrow, June 8th, is my birthday, and that 100,000 YouTube sub

693
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,720
mark would be an excellent milestone for that day, wouldn't it?

694
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,340
Please consider spreading my channel and this video around to your friends, it would be

695
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,340
highly appreciated.

696
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,840
I would also like to announce that on my gaming channel over on Twitch, twitch.tv slash gameboomers,

697
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,880
I intend to start doing a series of E3 streams over the coming week, the schedule for which

698
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,180
is currently on screen.

699
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,080
Please consider dropping in and watching the conferences and announcements with me, as

700
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,580
I guarantee it will be a hilarious trainwreck.

701
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,960
I will continue to try and work on SFO videos during my downtime, but please be patient,

702
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,480
as during E3 every year, I make gameboomers my first priority.

703
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,160
And you know what, that's actually starting to pay off.

704
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,780
I am just a hair away from making Twitch partner.

705
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,260
So as I mentioned, please consider supporting me over there and spreading those streams

706
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,260
around too.

707
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,260
Alright, I'll see you later.

708
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:53,760
I love you.
