00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Come one, come all, welcome to TikTok Tuesday yet again. Yes, this one's going out late.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,840
Thought I wouldn't be doing it today, but I am. Haha. Also, if you can hear some nonsense in the

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,680
background, you probably can't hear, but just in case you can. There's a new tenant living

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,840
downstairs and he's currently, I guess, fixing the place up. So maybe you'll hear, you know,

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,400
the drilling or whatever, but probably not. Anyway, you guys have been sending me TikToks

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,360
constantly and they're backed up. So let's check out what's going on today.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:38,880
What is this? Oh, oh god, I hate Zoomers, dude. You're in the way of everyone who's shopping.

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,360
Do you even have the permission of the person who, like, runs the store or owns the store

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,200
or whatever? Like, this is just fucking awful. Man, I hate Zoomers. I hate TikTok. I hate the

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,800
internet. I know I make money off of it, but I fucking hate it. I hate that what the internet

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,560
has become are these fucking e-thoughts who are out here inconveniencing everyone else trying to

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,680
make a shitty dance video. Talk about starting the episode off with some rage bait. This is why you

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,040
don't disrespect historic Mayan pyramids. Oh, she climbed up. I don't think you're allowed to do

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,160
this, are you? I mean, it's probably, yeah, there comes security. Oh, I mean, it's pretty unsafe.

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:36,240
Those are pretty steep steps, but still, like, it's, I don't know what they're saying. It's

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:49,040
probably something bad. What's going to happen to her? Yep, they're all booing her.

17
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:59,920
Oh, man, people are pissed. Yep, now they're messing with her.

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,520
Oh, they're pouring water on her. Dude, you poured water on everyone else but her.

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,400
Yep, that's what you get. Another example of someone just being an asshole in public

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,160
for internet clout. I mean, it's not only against the rules, it's unsafe.

21
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,440
And also, very clearly, the locals don't like it. So what are you doing, lady?

22
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,800
Now, the person who sent this to me sent it on Twitter, not the original TikTok account,

23
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,680
with the caption, good God, we should abolish landlords. Dude, dude, what the fuck? What do

24
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,320
you mean we should abolish landlords? The tenant destroyed the house, and now the landlord is

25
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,160
getting back at him for destroying his fucking house. It's like, oh, you're gonna fuck me over,

26
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,760
I'm gonna fuck you over. Isn't that how it should be? The captions went by a little bit quick. So

27
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,560
basically, what's happening is the landlord is going to clean it up using some expensive

28
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,440
cleaners, the cost of which will then be put onto the credit of the person who left the house in

29
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,840
this sorry state, as it should be. And if they don't pay it off, their credit rating is going

30
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,240
to be fucked. Isn't that how it should be? We should abolish landlords. Oh, fuck you.

31
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,640
This is absolutely a good thing. Burning Man 2023.

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,200
Yeah, man, I guess I have backed these up quite a bit. You guys have been sending me them like

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,920
crazy. So they're all backed up. Burning Man was at least a month or two ago, right?

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,520
Where like everyone was stranded. Yeah, they were all like, yeah, everyone was stuck at Burning Man.

35
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:44,640
Oh, God. Yes, let's just dance in the mud water. This is a good idea. What a shit show that was.

36
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,560
Yeah, they were all stranded out there with like no food. Yeah, that's right. Burning Man 2023 was

37
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,840
a week-long gathering in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada. August 27th to September 4th. On September

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,160
1st, heavy rainfall hit Nevada. There's a flash flood warning. Burning Man advised attendees they

39
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,880
should shelter in place and close the front entrance. Just lock them into the flood.

40
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,440
Organizers of the event suggested that participants should walk to the next town,

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,040
though hotel rooms were booked. The mud was so thick, you'll sink right into it

42
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,920
and be stuck there for a while. What a shit show. Oh my God, one person died? You know,

43
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,200
maybe just because I'm like a super video game nerd, right? But I never understood the appeal

44
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,080
of going to these things, especially when something like this might happen. Fuck that.

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,080
A bunch of like Muslims are assing it.

46
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,800
He's being taken away.

47
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,680
There he goes.

48
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,200
Wonder what the story there is. I mean, guy in hijab, he could just be like cross-dressing

49
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,880
in public. They decide that that degeneracy is not allowed in this Muslim country,

50
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,400
so they're apprehending him. Maybe he was doing something weird in the woman's restroom and he

51
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,200
was using the hijab as a cover. Hold on, this is from the Twitter account, The Right Side of

52
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,600
History. Man wearing a burka entered a woman's bathroom and planted a hidden camera. And when

53
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,080
he was caught, he claimed he identified as a woman and a lesbian. I mean, it's possible,

54
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,640
but this is not exactly the most, you know, unbiased Twitter account. In any case,

55
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:38,160
weirdos going to weird. Excuse me. Yes, ma'am? My baby asked for no pickles and there's pickles

56
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,080
on here. I apologize. Now you want a remake on your burger, ma'am? No, I want my money back.

57
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't want no remake with my burger. Why is these fried? These fries is called space alien.

58
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,640
I want my refunding. Did I want a large brown? I want a hot. You have to steer me now. I'm talking

59
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,760
to him. That's the manager. So you can go back there, finish flipping and doing whatever the

60
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,520
fuck you were doing. And what is this? I didn't ask this creature.

61
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,160
We asked for a 10 piece. You said what? Oh my fucking gosh.

62
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,760
I don't want to talk to you because he's allowed to record. I don't know if you record, you can

63
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:31,680
record. I'm stunned guys. I'm like, I don't know what to say. What's happening? Like I

64
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,640
don't believe someone can leave the house looking like that and be like, yeah, this is cool. What

65
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,480
the, what? I wasn't even listening to that conflict. Like it kind of sounded like she

66
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,520
was trying to scam him, get more food out of it, you know, getting more food at McDonald's a bit

67
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,120
by making a fuss, you know, happens all the time. I was just like, I was stunned at what we were

68
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:55,120
looking at. Oh man. Speaking of McDonald's or fast food anyway. Oh, they're fighting in the

69
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,160
drive-through. They're fighting in the drive-through throwing stuff back and forth.

70
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:11,280
She has a gun. What the fuck? What the fuck? She's just mag dumping at this fucking truck. Holy shit.

71
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,320
Well, that'll teach him. What the fuck has happened to people nowadays? You're getting into

72
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,440
a fight at the drive-through. You know, you don't like the service. They don't like how you're,

73
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,160
how you're treating them. What do you do? Just blow them the fuck away. Oh my God.

74
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,960
Just the kind of guy that would value somebody's time. Like I just, I'm just looking for my person.

75
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:11,120
I guess he's out there for me. I mean, I want to be somebody's husband someday, father. You'll get

76
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,760
it one day, man. Don't give up. I'm trying to do everything that's right. I just get stood up.

77
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,120
Like my feelings didn't even matter. Sitting there eating the meal by myself.

78
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:30,720
Realizing that nobody even cares about people anymore. Like alien dating shouldn't even be

79
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,120
this hard. It shouldn't be this hard to find somebody. It shouldn't be this difficult to

80
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,040
fall in love to be this kind of one another. I feel really sad. I'm trying, I'm trying really

81
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:49,760
hard not to make a joke about the lazy eye. I'm trying really hard not to make a joke about it.

82
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,720
So I think this went viral and I think there was a bunch of people who were like really sad

83
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,960
about it, obviously. But there was also a bunch of people who were like laughing at him and doing

84
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,880
like the patriarchy oppression, LOL male tears thing. That's come making a comeback. I fucking

85
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,600
thought we left that in like 2014, but it's making a fucking comeback. I feel bad. I feel bad for him.

86
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,720
Dating is hell in 2023. If you, if you meet like a good girl at school or something or at work,

87
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,480
you got to lock that shit down because dating is hell right now. Okay. This last one we have

88
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,480
to censor a little bit. What's going on is it's a woman who is not naked, but pretty much naked

89
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,240
dancing in public on what looks to be a stage or a float at an event in the street.

90
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,840
And there she is. She's dancing. She's dancing.

91
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,520
And why do you step in, lady? I can do. What exactly can't you do? Not what she's doing.

92
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,880
Why? I mean, she's naked. She's dancing in public. Why would you step in and block that?

93
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,560
What could possibly be her logic? I'm kind of stunned. It's like,

94
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,440
maybe she's the girlfriend of the person taking the video and she's pissed. Or maybe she's like,

95
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,440
now, hell nah, you're not going to objectify a woman like that. Even though she's in public

96
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,000
doing it to herself. There's the strange, I got to do a video, like a main video on this at some

97
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,720
point. There's this strange expectation among, let's say certain more online segments of the

98
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,640
left that you should be able to just do whatever you want with basically no consequences. Do porn,

99
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,120
be naked in public, be a prostitute, whatever. And that should never come back to haunt you.

100
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,120
And so maybe part of that is just interfering in people who document what's going on.

101
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,720
I don't know. I've got to think about it some more, but in any case, that is the end of

102
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,760
TikTok Tuesday for today. Thank you for being here. My friends. I really do appreciate it.

103
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,520
If you want more dev action, well, Naomi and I saw the movie A Haunting in Venice recently,

104
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,000
and we shot a vlog for that and put it up over on the dev kit channel. So

105
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,240
click the link on screen. If you're on YouTube, go and check that out.

106
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,280
