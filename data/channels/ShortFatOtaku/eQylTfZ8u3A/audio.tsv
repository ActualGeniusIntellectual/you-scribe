0	6800	Come one, come all, welcome to TikTok Tuesday yet again. Yes, this one's going out late.
6800	11840	Thought I wouldn't be doing it today, but I am. Haha. Also, if you can hear some nonsense in the
11840	15680	background, you probably can't hear, but just in case you can. There's a new tenant living
15680	19840	downstairs and he's currently, I guess, fixing the place up. So maybe you'll hear, you know,
19840	24400	the drilling or whatever, but probably not. Anyway, you guys have been sending me TikToks
24400	27360	constantly and they're backed up. So let's check out what's going on today.
27360	38880	What is this? Oh, oh god, I hate Zoomers, dude. You're in the way of everyone who's shopping.
46720	51360	Do you even have the permission of the person who, like, runs the store or owns the store
51360	59200	or whatever? Like, this is just fucking awful. Man, I hate Zoomers. I hate TikTok. I hate the
59200	62800	internet. I know I make money off of it, but I fucking hate it. I hate that what the internet
62800	68560	has become are these fucking e-thoughts who are out here inconveniencing everyone else trying to
68560	73680	make a shitty dance video. Talk about starting the episode off with some rage bait. This is why you
73680	81040	don't disrespect historic Mayan pyramids. Oh, she climbed up. I don't think you're allowed to do
81040	88160	this, are you? I mean, it's probably, yeah, there comes security. Oh, I mean, it's pretty unsafe.
88160	96240	Those are pretty steep steps, but still, like, it's, I don't know what they're saying. It's
96240	109040	probably something bad. What's going to happen to her? Yep, they're all booing her.
111040	119920	Oh, man, people are pissed. Yep, now they're messing with her.
125360	129520	Oh, they're pouring water on her. Dude, you poured water on everyone else but her.
133360	140400	Yep, that's what you get. Another example of someone just being an asshole in public
140400	144160	for internet clout. I mean, it's not only against the rules, it's unsafe.
144160	147440	And also, very clearly, the locals don't like it. So what are you doing, lady?
158640	162800	Now, the person who sent this to me sent it on Twitter, not the original TikTok account,
162800	167680	with the caption, good God, we should abolish landlords. Dude, dude, what the fuck? What do
167680	172320	you mean we should abolish landlords? The tenant destroyed the house, and now the landlord is
172320	176160	getting back at him for destroying his fucking house. It's like, oh, you're gonna fuck me over,
176160	179760	I'm gonna fuck you over. Isn't that how it should be? The captions went by a little bit quick. So
179760	182560	basically, what's happening is the landlord is going to clean it up using some expensive
182560	187440	cleaners, the cost of which will then be put onto the credit of the person who left the house in
187440	191840	this sorry state, as it should be. And if they don't pay it off, their credit rating is going
191840	196240	to be fucked. Isn't that how it should be? We should abolish landlords. Oh, fuck you.
196240	200640	This is absolutely a good thing. Burning Man 2023.
203440	207200	Yeah, man, I guess I have backed these up quite a bit. You guys have been sending me them like
207200	209920	crazy. So they're all backed up. Burning Man was at least a month or two ago, right?
210560	215520	Where like everyone was stranded. Yeah, they were all like, yeah, everyone was stuck at Burning Man.
215520	224640	Oh, God. Yes, let's just dance in the mud water. This is a good idea. What a shit show that was.
225440	230560	Yeah, they were all stranded out there with like no food. Yeah, that's right. Burning Man 2023 was
230560	237840	a week-long gathering in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada. August 27th to September 4th. On September
237840	244160	1st, heavy rainfall hit Nevada. There's a flash flood warning. Burning Man advised attendees they
244160	248880	should shelter in place and close the front entrance. Just lock them into the flood.
248880	253440	Organizers of the event suggested that participants should walk to the next town,
254000	259040	though hotel rooms were booked. The mud was so thick, you'll sink right into it
259040	263920	and be stuck there for a while. What a shit show. Oh my God, one person died? You know,
263920	269200	maybe just because I'm like a super video game nerd, right? But I never understood the appeal
269200	272080	of going to these things, especially when something like this might happen. Fuck that.
283440	286080	A bunch of like Muslims are assing it.
289840	290800	He's being taken away.
293120	293680	There he goes.
301600	307200	Wonder what the story there is. I mean, guy in hijab, he could just be like cross-dressing
307200	310880	in public. They decide that that degeneracy is not allowed in this Muslim country,
310960	314400	so they're apprehending him. Maybe he was doing something weird in the woman's restroom and he
314400	319200	was using the hijab as a cover. Hold on, this is from the Twitter account, The Right Side of
319200	323600	History. Man wearing a burka entered a woman's bathroom and planted a hidden camera. And when
323600	328080	he was caught, he claimed he identified as a woman and a lesbian. I mean, it's possible,
328080	332640	but this is not exactly the most, you know, unbiased Twitter account. In any case,
332640	338160	weirdos going to weird. Excuse me. Yes, ma'am? My baby asked for no pickles and there's pickles
338160	342080	on here. I apologize. Now you want a remake on your burger, ma'am? No, I want my money back.
342080	348000	I don't want no remake with my burger. Why is these fried? These fries is called space alien.
353600	358640	I want my refunding. Did I want a large brown? I want a hot. You have to steer me now. I'm talking
358640	361760	to him. That's the manager. So you can go back there, finish flipping and doing whatever the
361760	365520	fuck you were doing. And what is this? I didn't ask this creature.
370320	376160	We asked for a 10 piece. You said what? Oh my fucking gosh.
378000	383760	I don't want to talk to you because he's allowed to record. I don't know if you record, you can
383760	391680	record. I'm stunned guys. I'm like, I don't know what to say. What's happening? Like I
391680	396640	don't believe someone can leave the house looking like that and be like, yeah, this is cool. What
396640	400480	the, what? I wasn't even listening to that conflict. Like it kind of sounded like she
400480	403520	was trying to scam him, get more food out of it, you know, getting more food at McDonald's a bit
403520	407120	by making a fuss, you know, happens all the time. I was just like, I was stunned at what we were
407120	415120	looking at. Oh man. Speaking of McDonald's or fast food anyway. Oh, they're fighting in the
415120	418160	drive-through. They're fighting in the drive-through throwing stuff back and forth.
418800	431280	She has a gun. What the fuck? What the fuck? She's just mag dumping at this fucking truck. Holy shit.
432000	440320	Well, that'll teach him. What the fuck has happened to people nowadays? You're getting into
440320	443440	a fight at the drive-through. You know, you don't like the service. They don't like how you're,
443440	448160	how you're treating them. What do you do? Just blow them the fuck away. Oh my God.
473680	480960	Just the kind of guy that would value somebody's time. Like I just, I'm just looking for my person.
485200	491120	I guess he's out there for me. I mean, I want to be somebody's husband someday, father. You'll get
491120	495760	it one day, man. Don't give up. I'm trying to do everything that's right. I just get stood up.
496880	501120	Like my feelings didn't even matter. Sitting there eating the meal by myself.
503600	510720	Realizing that nobody even cares about people anymore. Like alien dating shouldn't even be
510720	517120	this hard. It shouldn't be this hard to find somebody. It shouldn't be this difficult to
517120	523040	fall in love to be this kind of one another. I feel really sad. I'm trying, I'm trying really
523040	529760	hard not to make a joke about the lazy eye. I'm trying really hard not to make a joke about it.
530320	534720	So I think this went viral and I think there was a bunch of people who were like really sad
534720	538960	about it, obviously. But there was also a bunch of people who were like laughing at him and doing
538960	544880	like the patriarchy oppression, LOL male tears thing. That's come making a comeback. I fucking
544880	549600	thought we left that in like 2014, but it's making a fucking comeback. I feel bad. I feel bad for him.
549600	554720	Dating is hell in 2023. If you, if you meet like a good girl at school or something or at work,
554720	558480	you got to lock that shit down because dating is hell right now. Okay. This last one we have
558480	564480	to censor a little bit. What's going on is it's a woman who is not naked, but pretty much naked
565040	570240	dancing in public on what looks to be a stage or a float at an event in the street.
571040	573840	And there she is. She's dancing. She's dancing.
575840	581520	And why do you step in, lady? I can do. What exactly can't you do? Not what she's doing.
583760	588880	Why? I mean, she's naked. She's dancing in public. Why would you step in and block that?
589680	592560	What could possibly be her logic? I'm kind of stunned. It's like,
592560	597440	maybe she's the girlfriend of the person taking the video and she's pissed. Or maybe she's like,
597440	601440	now, hell nah, you're not going to objectify a woman like that. Even though she's in public
601440	606000	doing it to herself. There's the strange, I got to do a video, like a main video on this at some
606000	612720	point. There's this strange expectation among, let's say certain more online segments of the
612720	618640	left that you should be able to just do whatever you want with basically no consequences. Do porn,
618640	623120	be naked in public, be a prostitute, whatever. And that should never come back to haunt you.
623120	627120	And so maybe part of that is just interfering in people who document what's going on.
627520	630720	I don't know. I've got to think about it some more, but in any case, that is the end of
630720	635760	TikTok Tuesday for today. Thank you for being here. My friends. I really do appreciate it.
635760	641520	If you want more dev action, well, Naomi and I saw the movie A Haunting in Venice recently,
641520	646000	and we shot a vlog for that and put it up over on the dev kit channel. So
646000	650240	click the link on screen. If you're on YouTube, go and check that out.
650240	655280	Thanks for being here, everyone. I will see you guys next time. I love you.
