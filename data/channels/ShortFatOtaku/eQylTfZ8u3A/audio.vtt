00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
Come one, come all, welcome to TikTok Tuesday yet again. Yes, this one's going out late.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.840
Thought I wouldn't be doing it today, but I am. Haha. Also, if you can hear some nonsense in the

00:11.840 --> 00:15.680
background, you probably can't hear, but just in case you can. There's a new tenant living

00:15.680 --> 00:19.840
downstairs and he's currently, I guess, fixing the place up. So maybe you'll hear, you know,

00:19.840 --> 00:24.400
the drilling or whatever, but probably not. Anyway, you guys have been sending me TikToks

00:24.400 --> 00:27.360
constantly and they're backed up. So let's check out what's going on today.

00:27.360 --> 00:38.880
What is this? Oh, oh god, I hate Zoomers, dude. You're in the way of everyone who's shopping.

00:46.720 --> 00:51.360
Do you even have the permission of the person who, like, runs the store or owns the store

00:51.360 --> 00:59.200
or whatever? Like, this is just fucking awful. Man, I hate Zoomers. I hate TikTok. I hate the

00:59.200 --> 01:02.800
internet. I know I make money off of it, but I fucking hate it. I hate that what the internet

01:02.800 --> 01:08.560
has become are these fucking e-thoughts who are out here inconveniencing everyone else trying to

01:08.560 --> 01:13.680
make a shitty dance video. Talk about starting the episode off with some rage bait. This is why you

01:13.680 --> 01:21.040
don't disrespect historic Mayan pyramids. Oh, she climbed up. I don't think you're allowed to do

01:21.040 --> 01:28.160
this, are you? I mean, it's probably, yeah, there comes security. Oh, I mean, it's pretty unsafe.

01:28.160 --> 01:36.240
Those are pretty steep steps, but still, like, it's, I don't know what they're saying. It's

01:36.240 --> 01:49.040
probably something bad. What's going to happen to her? Yep, they're all booing her.

01:51.040 --> 01:59.920
Oh, man, people are pissed. Yep, now they're messing with her.

02:05.360 --> 02:09.520
Oh, they're pouring water on her. Dude, you poured water on everyone else but her.

02:13.360 --> 02:20.400
Yep, that's what you get. Another example of someone just being an asshole in public

02:20.400 --> 02:24.160
for internet clout. I mean, it's not only against the rules, it's unsafe.

02:24.160 --> 02:27.440
And also, very clearly, the locals don't like it. So what are you doing, lady?

02:38.640 --> 02:42.800
Now, the person who sent this to me sent it on Twitter, not the original TikTok account,

02:42.800 --> 02:47.680
with the caption, good God, we should abolish landlords. Dude, dude, what the fuck? What do

02:47.680 --> 02:52.320
you mean we should abolish landlords? The tenant destroyed the house, and now the landlord is

02:52.320 --> 02:56.160
getting back at him for destroying his fucking house. It's like, oh, you're gonna fuck me over,

02:56.160 --> 02:59.760
I'm gonna fuck you over. Isn't that how it should be? The captions went by a little bit quick. So

02:59.760 --> 03:02.560
basically, what's happening is the landlord is going to clean it up using some expensive

03:02.560 --> 03:07.440
cleaners, the cost of which will then be put onto the credit of the person who left the house in

03:07.440 --> 03:11.840
this sorry state, as it should be. And if they don't pay it off, their credit rating is going

03:11.840 --> 03:16.240
to be fucked. Isn't that how it should be? We should abolish landlords. Oh, fuck you.

03:16.240 --> 03:20.640
This is absolutely a good thing. Burning Man 2023.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.200
Yeah, man, I guess I have backed these up quite a bit. You guys have been sending me them like

03:27.200 --> 03:29.920
crazy. So they're all backed up. Burning Man was at least a month or two ago, right?

03:30.560 --> 03:35.520
Where like everyone was stranded. Yeah, they were all like, yeah, everyone was stuck at Burning Man.

03:35.520 --> 03:44.640
Oh, God. Yes, let's just dance in the mud water. This is a good idea. What a shit show that was.

03:45.440 --> 03:50.560
Yeah, they were all stranded out there with like no food. Yeah, that's right. Burning Man 2023 was

03:50.560 --> 03:57.840
a week-long gathering in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada. August 27th to September 4th. On September

03:57.840 --> 04:04.160
1st, heavy rainfall hit Nevada. There's a flash flood warning. Burning Man advised attendees they

04:04.160 --> 04:08.880
should shelter in place and close the front entrance. Just lock them into the flood.

04:08.880 --> 04:13.440
Organizers of the event suggested that participants should walk to the next town,

04:14.000 --> 04:19.040
though hotel rooms were booked. The mud was so thick, you'll sink right into it

04:19.040 --> 04:23.920
and be stuck there for a while. What a shit show. Oh my God, one person died? You know,

04:23.920 --> 04:29.200
maybe just because I'm like a super video game nerd, right? But I never understood the appeal

04:29.200 --> 04:32.080
of going to these things, especially when something like this might happen. Fuck that.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.080
A bunch of like Muslims are assing it.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.800
He's being taken away.

04:53.120 --> 04:53.680
There he goes.

05:01.600 --> 05:07.200
Wonder what the story there is. I mean, guy in hijab, he could just be like cross-dressing

05:07.200 --> 05:10.880
in public. They decide that that degeneracy is not allowed in this Muslim country,

05:10.960 --> 05:14.400
so they're apprehending him. Maybe he was doing something weird in the woman's restroom and he

05:14.400 --> 05:19.200
was using the hijab as a cover. Hold on, this is from the Twitter account, The Right Side of

05:19.200 --> 05:23.600
History. Man wearing a burka entered a woman's bathroom and planted a hidden camera. And when

05:23.600 --> 05:28.080
he was caught, he claimed he identified as a woman and a lesbian. I mean, it's possible,

05:28.080 --> 05:32.640
but this is not exactly the most, you know, unbiased Twitter account. In any case,

05:32.640 --> 05:38.160
weirdos going to weird. Excuse me. Yes, ma'am? My baby asked for no pickles and there's pickles

05:38.160 --> 05:42.080
on here. I apologize. Now you want a remake on your burger, ma'am? No, I want my money back.

05:42.080 --> 05:48.000
I don't want no remake with my burger. Why is these fried? These fries is called space alien.

05:53.600 --> 05:58.640
I want my refunding. Did I want a large brown? I want a hot. You have to steer me now. I'm talking

05:58.640 --> 06:01.760
to him. That's the manager. So you can go back there, finish flipping and doing whatever the

06:01.760 --> 06:05.520
fuck you were doing. And what is this? I didn't ask this creature.

06:10.320 --> 06:16.160
We asked for a 10 piece. You said what? Oh my fucking gosh.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.760
I don't want to talk to you because he's allowed to record. I don't know if you record, you can

06:23.760 --> 06:31.680
record. I'm stunned guys. I'm like, I don't know what to say. What's happening? Like I

06:31.680 --> 06:36.640
don't believe someone can leave the house looking like that and be like, yeah, this is cool. What

06:36.640 --> 06:40.480
the, what? I wasn't even listening to that conflict. Like it kind of sounded like she

06:40.480 --> 06:43.520
was trying to scam him, get more food out of it, you know, getting more food at McDonald's a bit

06:43.520 --> 06:47.120
by making a fuss, you know, happens all the time. I was just like, I was stunned at what we were

06:47.120 --> 06:55.120
looking at. Oh man. Speaking of McDonald's or fast food anyway. Oh, they're fighting in the

06:55.120 --> 06:58.160
drive-through. They're fighting in the drive-through throwing stuff back and forth.

06:58.800 --> 07:11.280
She has a gun. What the fuck? What the fuck? She's just mag dumping at this fucking truck. Holy shit.

07:12.000 --> 07:20.320
Well, that'll teach him. What the fuck has happened to people nowadays? You're getting into

07:20.320 --> 07:23.440
a fight at the drive-through. You know, you don't like the service. They don't like how you're,

07:23.440 --> 07:28.160
how you're treating them. What do you do? Just blow them the fuck away. Oh my God.

07:53.680 --> 08:00.960
Just the kind of guy that would value somebody's time. Like I just, I'm just looking for my person.

08:05.200 --> 08:11.120
I guess he's out there for me. I mean, I want to be somebody's husband someday, father. You'll get

08:11.120 --> 08:15.760
it one day, man. Don't give up. I'm trying to do everything that's right. I just get stood up.

08:16.880 --> 08:21.120
Like my feelings didn't even matter. Sitting there eating the meal by myself.

08:23.600 --> 08:30.720
Realizing that nobody even cares about people anymore. Like alien dating shouldn't even be

08:30.720 --> 08:37.120
this hard. It shouldn't be this hard to find somebody. It shouldn't be this difficult to

08:37.120 --> 08:43.040
fall in love to be this kind of one another. I feel really sad. I'm trying, I'm trying really

08:43.040 --> 08:49.760
hard not to make a joke about the lazy eye. I'm trying really hard not to make a joke about it.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.720
So I think this went viral and I think there was a bunch of people who were like really sad

08:54.720 --> 08:58.960
about it, obviously. But there was also a bunch of people who were like laughing at him and doing

08:58.960 --> 09:04.880
like the patriarchy oppression, LOL male tears thing. That's come making a comeback. I fucking

09:04.880 --> 09:09.600
thought we left that in like 2014, but it's making a fucking comeback. I feel bad. I feel bad for him.

09:09.600 --> 09:14.720
Dating is hell in 2023. If you, if you meet like a good girl at school or something or at work,

09:14.720 --> 09:18.480
you got to lock that shit down because dating is hell right now. Okay. This last one we have

09:18.480 --> 09:24.480
to censor a little bit. What's going on is it's a woman who is not naked, but pretty much naked

09:25.040 --> 09:30.240
dancing in public on what looks to be a stage or a float at an event in the street.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.840
And there she is. She's dancing. She's dancing.

09:35.840 --> 09:41.520
And why do you step in, lady? I can do. What exactly can't you do? Not what she's doing.

09:43.760 --> 09:48.880
Why? I mean, she's naked. She's dancing in public. Why would you step in and block that?

09:49.680 --> 09:52.560
What could possibly be her logic? I'm kind of stunned. It's like,

09:52.560 --> 09:57.440
maybe she's the girlfriend of the person taking the video and she's pissed. Or maybe she's like,

09:57.440 --> 10:01.440
now, hell nah, you're not going to objectify a woman like that. Even though she's in public

10:01.440 --> 10:06.000
doing it to herself. There's the strange, I got to do a video, like a main video on this at some

10:06.000 --> 10:12.720
point. There's this strange expectation among, let's say certain more online segments of the

10:12.720 --> 10:18.640
left that you should be able to just do whatever you want with basically no consequences. Do porn,

10:18.640 --> 10:23.120
be naked in public, be a prostitute, whatever. And that should never come back to haunt you.

10:23.120 --> 10:27.120
And so maybe part of that is just interfering in people who document what's going on.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.720
I don't know. I've got to think about it some more, but in any case, that is the end of

10:30.720 --> 10:35.760
TikTok Tuesday for today. Thank you for being here. My friends. I really do appreciate it.

10:35.760 --> 10:41.520
