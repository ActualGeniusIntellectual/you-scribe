1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Contrary to the opinions of the communists, money has a moral framework underpinning it.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,360
In a very general sense, it works like this. The more money you have, the more value you have

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,400
provided to other people's lives. Now, there's certainly exceptions to this rule. For example,

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,720
there's many ways people provide value to each other without exchanging money, or they provide

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,720
that value at a much lower rate than is the market standard, for a reason other than money.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,280
Additionally, this rule is not consistently correct at the extreme ends of the distribution,

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,840
meaning the super rich and the super poor. There's absolutely ways to become rich without

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,240
providing value to other people, like winning the lottery, or trading in stocks, neither of

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,720
which actually involve creating a product or service yourself. And obviously, the super poor

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,800
still have value as human beings and to those other people that they interact with. For the

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,600
vast majority of us, the more you get paid, the more people your efforts have helped.

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,160
Consider this situation. You're a cobbler making shoes and you need a chair. Your friend is a

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,160
carpenter making chairs and he needs a pair of shoes. Let's assume, for the sake of argument,

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,520
the shoes and the chair are worth the same value at market. Well, value is relative. You don't

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840
personally value your shoes as much as the market does, because you can make shoes anytime you want.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,600
It's become quite easy for you to do. If you ever need a new pair, you can whip them up in no time

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,960
flat. But you personally value the chair more than the market does, because you actually need

18
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,440
a chair and you can't build one yourself. Your carpenter friend feels the same way.

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,640
He undervalues his own chairs and overvalues your shoes, relative to the market. So,

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,880
when you and your friend make a straight exchange of one pair of shoes for one chair,

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,760
even though the market value of the items is equal, both people see an increase of value in

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,320
their lives, because they needed the other person's creations more than their own. This is why value

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,920
is not a zero-sum game, hoarded by the super rich as the communists like to believe, but instead

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,640
value is generated through honest trade. And things like hard work or innovation can generate

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,080
new value. But where does the money come in? Well, money is simply a portable medium to store

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,480
value. Rather than trading your shoes straight across other objects you might need every single

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,680
time, and therefore only being able to trade the shoes, and so likely only making the shoes,

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,240
when you need something in that moment, money allows you to trade many shoes right away,

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,640
hold onto the value in a portable form, and then spend that value at a later date for something

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,120
that you need. Money simplifies the bartering process by allowing you to defer the reward of

31
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,440
your shoe creation to a later date, and it also allows you to store up the results of successfully

32
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,080
trading your shoes for later when you may actually need it more than you do now. Money is essentially

33
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,160
a more sophisticated version of the squirrel storing nuts away for winter, which is probably

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,680
why that euphemism is so commonly used to describe the practice. So, if money is simply a representation

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,800
of how much work you've performed in the service of other people, then money can be used as a

36
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,960
general measurement of how many other people you've helped. This is the morality of money.

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,360
If your cobbler business is successful, then you've spent a lot of your time and effort creating

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,000
many pairs of shoes. Many people are wearing those shoes and have had their lives measurably

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,080
improved as a result of your efforts, and the money you've got in the bank is a symbol of how

40
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,480
much you've done for them. Meanwhile, if your carpenter friend is actually a shoddy carpenter,

41
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,960
he won't be selling as many chairs. He'll have less money, and he will have improved the lives

42
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,840
of less people. Let's talk about a modern example. This idea is the answer to why an athlete or an

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,240
actor makes significantly more money than a teacher. A teacher may provide a significantly

44
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,840
more important service than the simple entertainment of an actor, but how many people

45
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,760
will each of them impact? A famous entertainer will reach millions of people over the course of

46
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,200
their career, but a teacher with a class size of 50 students every year during a 40-year career

47
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,520
will only teach 2,000 people. Even though the service the teacher provides is significantly

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,680
more important, the sheer volume of the people the entertainer impacts more than makes up for

49
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,400
their diminished individual impact in terms of total value added to people's lives. And so,

50
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,400
they get paid more. This is also, by the way, why unsuccessful sports stars or actors make far less

51
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,920
than teachers. Which then brings us to the joy and the curse of mass market appeal. Niche products,

52
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,120
by design, help fewer people, and therefore demand a high price, simply because the creators of those

53
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,200
products would not make enough money to survive selling them at a lower price. There's just not

54
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,120
enough customers to go around. Meanwhile, if something has mass market appeal, you can

55
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,000
sacrifice nearly everything and still get quite rich, as we've seen by literally everyone

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,240
pandering to the Chinese market right now. The principle still applies. Yes, if you tweak things

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,400
a bit, your product quality goes down, and individual people have less value added to

58
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,360
their lives as a result of your work. But if that same tweak opens up a new market with millions of

59
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,840
new customers, that loss in individual value is more than made up for by the new value you're

60
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,680
bringing to millions of new people. And that's reflected in the profits. Now, we can argue

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,760
whether or not it's actually good for companies to abandon their domestic markets and chase the

62
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,840
overseas dollar in a bid to provide value to the people of that new market. There's very good

63
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,000
arguments against that practice, and that's probably a place for sensible government regulation

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,160
through tariffs and whatnot. But that's not the point. The point of the video is to discuss how

65
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,880
money has a moral underpinning. How having more money means that you probably helped more people

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,120
through your own efforts. I've listened to a number of self-made CEOs give speeches about how

67
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,320
to expand a business. I've listened to motivational speakers. I've listened to graduation and

68
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,280
commencement speeches at universities. I've even listened to a lot of everyone's favorite Canadian

69
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,240
psychologist frog man. What they've all got in common is that they describe their business not

70
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,920
as a business, nor as a way to make money, and not even as a career, though they still admit it's all

71
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,120
those things. They describe it primarily as a service and themselves as servants. Maybe that's

72
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,480
just them making themselves look good in the public eye. That's probably a good chunk of it,

73
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,800
in fact. But I still choose to believe that it is at least partially because they understand

74
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,720
that money is ultimately meaningless if it does not represent the good that you do for other

75
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,360
people. This is why most rich capitalists don't actually keep their money locked away in a vault,

76
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,320
so they can go for a swim Scrooge McDuck style every once in a while. Most of them run foundations

77
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,960
where they can perform charitable work. Most of them are venture capitalists, seeing the value in

78
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,200
other people's innovations and choosing to give them a leg up. Most of their wealth isn't even in

79
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,480
money at all. In fact, the actual medium of money itself doesn't even matter. For example, people

80
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,200
don't covet gold for any of gold's innate properties. It's just that gold is rare, and it

81
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,800
couldn't be artificially produced in large quantities for almost all of human history.

82
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,520
So, as a general rule, if you had a gold coin, either you mined the ore out of the earth yourself

83
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,240
and minted it, which was labor in its own right, or at some point you exchanged your labor for that

84
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,040
coin and were therefore entitled to its fruits. The fact that we use paper money now, or electronic

85
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,040
money, doesn't change this paradigm, but that's the core problem the communists have with this

86
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,320
system. Exchanging labor for money. The communists believe that two people choosing to exchange labor

87
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,040
for money is inherently exploitative, because the person choosing to spend their labor isn't making

88
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,600
a real choice. They're driven by the biological necessities of needing to pay for food and shelter,

89
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,200
and the person choosing to spend their money is exploiting the other person for their labor.

90
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,200
They don't believe that two people making a voluntary exchange are increasing each other's

91
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,920
value, like the cobbler and the carpenter, but that if any exchange is based on the necessity

92
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,280
of a party, it can only be exploitative. Their competing idea is the labor theory of value,

93
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,520
which basically states that if a person's labor is added to a commodity, the commodity's value

94
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,640
increases. In reality, this is obviously not true. For example, you can buy the ingredients for a

95
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,200
meal, foul up the cooking of the meal because you're a terrible cook, and produce a meal with

96
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,120
less value than the individual ingredients you started with. But under communism, there is a

97
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,280
strange quasi-worship of the worker as a mythical figure. And so all labor, no matter its quality,

98
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,320
must add value to a commodity in order for it to be a non-exploitative exchange. And when difference

99
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,280
in quality becomes the issue, then quality as a concept must be removed from the equation entirely.

100
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,320
This is why a lot of people refer to communism as a great equalization, or a lowering everyone down

101
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,600
to the common denominator. Because while you can't force untalented people to have talent,

102
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,520
you can force talented people to be untalented, or at least not fully utilize those talents. And

103
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,000
more often than not, the communists did this through blood. Every communist society inevitably

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,840
collapsed because its economy could no longer function. Everyone was expected to produce the

105
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,200
same work, as they believed human beings were a blank slate, and everything from inclination to

106
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,480
talent to aptitude to intelligence was simply a product of socialization. The least productive

107
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,200
members of society were simultaneously praised as the proletariat, and whipped to work as hard

108
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,680
as they could lest they waste the people's labor. And the most productive members of society either

109
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,880
lowered themselves voluntarily in order to survive, or were lowered forcefully by the state, some of

110
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,880
them through systematic abuse that destroyed their ability to produce, some of them through their

111
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,080
slaughter, under the guise of them being the bourgeoisie. And so, with nobody left to perform

112
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,200
exceptional or innovative work, and with everyone else's work valued the same regardless of quality,

113
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,680
the communist society always collapses under the weight of its own failure. Because if the least

114
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,160
productive worker is valued as much as the most productive worker, why wouldn't you just take it

115
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,240
easy? As I said earlier, this society-wide catastrophe stems from the belief that two

116
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,040
people exchanging labor for money is inherently exploitative, due to the underlying motivations

117
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,560
of necessity on the part of the worker. But the communist doesn't understand that necessity is

118
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,960
not a function of capitalism, but a function of reality. The communist believes that necessity

119
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,640
would not exist under communism. No, seriously. I've been arguing with a lot of commies on Twitter

120
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,120
this past week, and one of them even said, we don't need money if we all just keep our labor

121
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,240
and have no use for it, and in response to my desire to save up for a rainy day, said, what rainy

122
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,640
day? They believe the problems of the world are an exclusive function of capitalism, and the great

123
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,680
equalization will lead to paradise on earth, where there are no more rainy days to save up for. They

124
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,760
don't understand that money isn't some kind of magical force wielded by the rich against the poor.

125
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,680
They don't understand that while exploitation does exist, there are certainly rich people who

126
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,520
became rich without exploitation. And they don't understand that a person with a lot of money,

127
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,480
who earned it all fairly, is not inherently immoral simply for having money. That's why

128
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,400
the communists had to define two people consenting to exchange labor for money

129
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,440
as inherently exploitative. Even as they tout the primacy of consent in other political discussions,

130
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,880
when it comes to money, consent is just not enough. To them, the working man cannot consent,

131
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,440
in the same way that a child cannot consent. And the working man must be protected and shepherded

132
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,320
like a child is. It's why they scold working class people who are capitalists as bootlickers

133
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,720
or traitors, in much the same way that a parent would scold a child. They rattle on about rich

134
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,200
old men, not understanding that the reason old people are disproportionately rich is because

135
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,400
they've had approximately 50 more years of stored up labor under their belts. They've had 50 more

136
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,680
years to actually do work. In the end, communism is simply an excuse to justify their desire to

137
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,360
steal labor from people who spent years earning it. And you know, if you want a little bit of

138
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,040
hypocritical fun, go look up the old tweets of Bernie Sanders. He used to talk about the

139
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,400
exploitation of the millionaires and billionaires until he himself became a millionaire in 2016.

140
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,520
Now it's all just the billionaires. This is how it always happens. Those who believe capitalism

141
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,240
is inherently exploitative, while simultaneously still climbing its rungs, will adjust their

142
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,560
framework such that they are still the poor and the one percent still refers anybody more rich

143
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,360
than they are, even as their own wealth grows. I am happy to argue in defense of capitalism,

144
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,320
even though I am poor myself, because I understand the morality of money. I understand that,

145
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,800
a handful of notable exceptions notwithstanding, those people who have more money than me,

146
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,360
have added more value to the lives of more people than I have. And if society were restructured in

147
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,760
such a way that those people would no longer be allowed to add value to the lives of other people,

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,560

150
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,560
for your talents, your skills, your education or your hard work. It's better to pay them than to

151
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,360
lose them.
