0	4400	Contrary to the opinions of the communists, money has a moral framework underpinning it.
4400	9360	In a very general sense, it works like this. The more money you have, the more value you have
9360	14400	provided to other people's lives. Now, there's certainly exceptions to this rule. For example,
14400	18720	there's many ways people provide value to each other without exchanging money, or they provide
18720	22720	that value at a much lower rate than is the market standard, for a reason other than money.
22720	27280	Additionally, this rule is not consistently correct at the extreme ends of the distribution,
27280	31840	meaning the super rich and the super poor. There's absolutely ways to become rich without
31840	36240	providing value to other people, like winning the lottery, or trading in stocks, neither of
36240	40720	which actually involve creating a product or service yourself. And obviously, the super poor
40720	44800	still have value as human beings and to those other people that they interact with. For the
44800	49600	vast majority of us, the more you get paid, the more people your efforts have helped.
49600	54160	Consider this situation. You're a cobbler making shoes and you need a chair. Your friend is a
54160	58160	carpenter making chairs and he needs a pair of shoes. Let's assume, for the sake of argument,
58160	63520	the shoes and the chair are worth the same value at market. Well, value is relative. You don't
63520	67840	personally value your shoes as much as the market does, because you can make shoes anytime you want.
67840	71600	It's become quite easy for you to do. If you ever need a new pair, you can whip them up in no time
71600	76960	flat. But you personally value the chair more than the market does, because you actually need
76960	81440	a chair and you can't build one yourself. Your carpenter friend feels the same way.
81440	86640	He undervalues his own chairs and overvalues your shoes, relative to the market. So,
86640	90880	when you and your friend make a straight exchange of one pair of shoes for one chair,
90880	95760	even though the market value of the items is equal, both people see an increase of value in
95760	100320	their lives, because they needed the other person's creations more than their own. This is why value
100320	105920	is not a zero-sum game, hoarded by the super rich as the communists like to believe, but instead
105920	110640	value is generated through honest trade. And things like hard work or innovation can generate
110640	116080	new value. But where does the money come in? Well, money is simply a portable medium to store
116080	120480	value. Rather than trading your shoes straight across other objects you might need every single
120480	125680	time, and therefore only being able to trade the shoes, and so likely only making the shoes,
125680	130240	when you need something in that moment, money allows you to trade many shoes right away,
130240	134640	hold onto the value in a portable form, and then spend that value at a later date for something
134640	139120	that you need. Money simplifies the bartering process by allowing you to defer the reward of
139120	143440	your shoe creation to a later date, and it also allows you to store up the results of successfully
143440	148080	trading your shoes for later when you may actually need it more than you do now. Money is essentially
148080	152160	a more sophisticated version of the squirrel storing nuts away for winter, which is probably
152160	157680	why that euphemism is so commonly used to describe the practice. So, if money is simply a representation
157680	162800	of how much work you've performed in the service of other people, then money can be used as a
162800	166960	general measurement of how many other people you've helped. This is the morality of money.
166960	171360	If your cobbler business is successful, then you've spent a lot of your time and effort creating
171360	176000	many pairs of shoes. Many people are wearing those shoes and have had their lives measurably
176000	180080	improved as a result of your efforts, and the money you've got in the bank is a symbol of how
180080	184480	much you've done for them. Meanwhile, if your carpenter friend is actually a shoddy carpenter,
184480	188960	he won't be selling as many chairs. He'll have less money, and he will have improved the lives
188960	193840	of less people. Let's talk about a modern example. This idea is the answer to why an athlete or an
193840	198240	actor makes significantly more money than a teacher. A teacher may provide a significantly
198240	201840	more important service than the simple entertainment of an actor, but how many people
201840	205760	will each of them impact? A famous entertainer will reach millions of people over the course of
205760	211200	their career, but a teacher with a class size of 50 students every year during a 40-year career
211200	215520	will only teach 2,000 people. Even though the service the teacher provides is significantly
215520	219680	more important, the sheer volume of the people the entertainer impacts more than makes up for
219680	224400	their diminished individual impact in terms of total value added to people's lives. And so,
224400	230400	they get paid more. This is also, by the way, why unsuccessful sports stars or actors make far less
230400	235920	than teachers. Which then brings us to the joy and the curse of mass market appeal. Niche products,
235920	241120	by design, help fewer people, and therefore demand a high price, simply because the creators of those
241120	245200	products would not make enough money to survive selling them at a lower price. There's just not
245200	249120	enough customers to go around. Meanwhile, if something has mass market appeal, you can
249120	254000	sacrifice nearly everything and still get quite rich, as we've seen by literally everyone
254000	258240	pandering to the Chinese market right now. The principle still applies. Yes, if you tweak things
258240	262400	a bit, your product quality goes down, and individual people have less value added to
262400	267360	their lives as a result of your work. But if that same tweak opens up a new market with millions of
267360	271840	new customers, that loss in individual value is more than made up for by the new value you're
271840	275680	bringing to millions of new people. And that's reflected in the profits. Now, we can argue
275680	279760	whether or not it's actually good for companies to abandon their domestic markets and chase the
279760	283840	overseas dollar in a bid to provide value to the people of that new market. There's very good
283840	288000	arguments against that practice, and that's probably a place for sensible government regulation
288000	292160	through tariffs and whatnot. But that's not the point. The point of the video is to discuss how
292160	296880	money has a moral underpinning. How having more money means that you probably helped more people
296880	301120	through your own efforts. I've listened to a number of self-made CEOs give speeches about how
301120	306320	to expand a business. I've listened to motivational speakers. I've listened to graduation and
306320	311280	commencement speeches at universities. I've even listened to a lot of everyone's favorite Canadian
311280	316240	psychologist frog man. What they've all got in common is that they describe their business not
316240	321920	as a business, nor as a way to make money, and not even as a career, though they still admit it's all
321920	327120	those things. They describe it primarily as a service and themselves as servants. Maybe that's
327120	330480	just them making themselves look good in the public eye. That's probably a good chunk of it,
330480	334800	in fact. But I still choose to believe that it is at least partially because they understand
334800	338720	that money is ultimately meaningless if it does not represent the good that you do for other
338720	343360	people. This is why most rich capitalists don't actually keep their money locked away in a vault,
343360	348320	so they can go for a swim Scrooge McDuck style every once in a while. Most of them run foundations
348320	352960	where they can perform charitable work. Most of them are venture capitalists, seeing the value in
352960	357200	other people's innovations and choosing to give them a leg up. Most of their wealth isn't even in
357200	362480	money at all. In fact, the actual medium of money itself doesn't even matter. For example, people
362480	367200	don't covet gold for any of gold's innate properties. It's just that gold is rare, and it
367200	370800	couldn't be artificially produced in large quantities for almost all of human history.
370800	375520	So, as a general rule, if you had a gold coin, either you mined the ore out of the earth yourself
375520	380240	and minted it, which was labor in its own right, or at some point you exchanged your labor for that
380240	385040	coin and were therefore entitled to its fruits. The fact that we use paper money now, or electronic
385040	389040	money, doesn't change this paradigm, but that's the core problem the communists have with this
389040	394320	system. Exchanging labor for money. The communists believe that two people choosing to exchange labor
394320	399040	for money is inherently exploitative, because the person choosing to spend their labor isn't making
399040	403600	a real choice. They're driven by the biological necessities of needing to pay for food and shelter,
403600	407200	and the person choosing to spend their money is exploiting the other person for their labor.
407200	411200	They don't believe that two people making a voluntary exchange are increasing each other's
411200	415920	value, like the cobbler and the carpenter, but that if any exchange is based on the necessity
415920	421280	of a party, it can only be exploitative. Their competing idea is the labor theory of value,
421280	425520	which basically states that if a person's labor is added to a commodity, the commodity's value
425520	430640	increases. In reality, this is obviously not true. For example, you can buy the ingredients for a
430640	435200	meal, foul up the cooking of the meal because you're a terrible cook, and produce a meal with
435200	439120	less value than the individual ingredients you started with. But under communism, there is a
439120	445280	strange quasi-worship of the worker as a mythical figure. And so all labor, no matter its quality,
445280	450320	must add value to a commodity in order for it to be a non-exploitative exchange. And when difference
450320	455280	in quality becomes the issue, then quality as a concept must be removed from the equation entirely.
455280	460320	This is why a lot of people refer to communism as a great equalization, or a lowering everyone down
460320	465600	to the common denominator. Because while you can't force untalented people to have talent,
465600	471520	you can force talented people to be untalented, or at least not fully utilize those talents. And
471520	476000	more often than not, the communists did this through blood. Every communist society inevitably
476000	479840	collapsed because its economy could no longer function. Everyone was expected to produce the
479840	485200	same work, as they believed human beings were a blank slate, and everything from inclination to
485200	490480	talent to aptitude to intelligence was simply a product of socialization. The least productive
490480	495200	members of society were simultaneously praised as the proletariat, and whipped to work as hard
495200	499680	as they could lest they waste the people's labor. And the most productive members of society either
499680	504880	lowered themselves voluntarily in order to survive, or were lowered forcefully by the state, some of
504880	508880	them through systematic abuse that destroyed their ability to produce, some of them through their
508880	514080	slaughter, under the guise of them being the bourgeoisie. And so, with nobody left to perform
514080	519200	exceptional or innovative work, and with everyone else's work valued the same regardless of quality,
519200	523680	the communist society always collapses under the weight of its own failure. Because if the least
523680	528160	productive worker is valued as much as the most productive worker, why wouldn't you just take it
528160	532240	easy? As I said earlier, this society-wide catastrophe stems from the belief that two
532240	537040	people exchanging labor for money is inherently exploitative, due to the underlying motivations
537040	540560	of necessity on the part of the worker. But the communist doesn't understand that necessity is
540560	544960	not a function of capitalism, but a function of reality. The communist believes that necessity
544960	550640	would not exist under communism. No, seriously. I've been arguing with a lot of commies on Twitter
550640	555120	this past week, and one of them even said, we don't need money if we all just keep our labor
555120	560240	and have no use for it, and in response to my desire to save up for a rainy day, said, what rainy
560240	564640	day? They believe the problems of the world are an exclusive function of capitalism, and the great
564640	569680	equalization will lead to paradise on earth, where there are no more rainy days to save up for. They
569680	573760	don't understand that money isn't some kind of magical force wielded by the rich against the poor.
573760	577680	They don't understand that while exploitation does exist, there are certainly rich people who
577680	581520	became rich without exploitation. And they don't understand that a person with a lot of money,
581520	586480	who earned it all fairly, is not inherently immoral simply for having money. That's why
586480	590400	the communists had to define two people consenting to exchange labor for money
590400	595440	as inherently exploitative. Even as they tout the primacy of consent in other political discussions,
595440	600880	when it comes to money, consent is just not enough. To them, the working man cannot consent,
600880	605440	in the same way that a child cannot consent. And the working man must be protected and shepherded
605440	610320	like a child is. It's why they scold working class people who are capitalists as bootlickers
610320	614720	or traitors, in much the same way that a parent would scold a child. They rattle on about rich
614720	619200	old men, not understanding that the reason old people are disproportionately rich is because
619200	624400	they've had approximately 50 more years of stored up labor under their belts. They've had 50 more
624400	629680	years to actually do work. In the end, communism is simply an excuse to justify their desire to
629680	633360	steal labor from people who spent years earning it. And you know, if you want a little bit of
633360	637040	hypocritical fun, go look up the old tweets of Bernie Sanders. He used to talk about the
637040	642400	exploitation of the millionaires and billionaires until he himself became a millionaire in 2016.
642400	647520	Now it's all just the billionaires. This is how it always happens. Those who believe capitalism
647520	652240	is inherently exploitative, while simultaneously still climbing its rungs, will adjust their
652240	656560	framework such that they are still the poor and the one percent still refers anybody more rich
656560	661360	than they are, even as their own wealth grows. I am happy to argue in defense of capitalism,
661360	666320	even though I am poor myself, because I understand the morality of money. I understand that,
666320	670800	a handful of notable exceptions notwithstanding, those people who have more money than me,
670800	675360	have added more value to the lives of more people than I have. And if society were restructured in
675360	679760	such a way that those people would no longer be allowed to add value to the lives of other people,
679760	684560	all of us, rich and poor, young and old, would suffer tremendously because of it. The worst
684560	689760	thing a civilization can do is to tell its most exceptional people, we will no longer reward you
689760	694560	for your talents, your skills, your education or your hard work. It's better to pay them than to
694560	695360	lose them.
