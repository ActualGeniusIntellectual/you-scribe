1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
It's time to talk about Andrew Tate again, for the third time in fact.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,580
I really should just make this into a semi-regular mini-series, I'll call it The Uptate, haha.

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,420
I gave a basic overview about Andrew Tate on the TUBcast a while ago.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:21,440
I also did a second video on him, going over his history as a fighter, his transition into

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,200
a celebrity role after he aged out of fighting, the creation of his webcam business, where

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,900
he employed some pretty shady behavior, and his poor treatment of women all throughout.

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,560
But there is some new info since the last time I talked about him, that we should probably

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
check out.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,940
And just so we're clear, the latest news in this story doesn't involve Andrew Tate's

10
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,860
hairline receding faster than the Ukrainian border.

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,860
These pictures were taken after he'd been in prison for a while, and enabled to keep

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,900
his head shaved.

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,300
Andrew Tate claimed once that he chose to be bald, but I have a feeling that he didn't

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,700
really have any other choice.

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,180
No, the newest Andrew Tate news has to do, primarily, with how his legal case is progressing.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,620
If you'll recall, his home in Romania was raided by the cops, who currently have him

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,360
locked away pending further investigation, as he is considered a flight risk.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,540
Good thing, too, as it came out that the Tates were in the middle of planning to flee to

19
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,040
Dubai when they were caught.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,220
The body cam footage of the home raid showed money, passports, and weapons laying around

21
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,020
the Tate's pad, as well as a gorilla made of cash.

22
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,660
I guess the rich really do have some strange tastes.

23
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,580
Unfortunately for them, a lot of that stuff has since been seized by the Romanian state,

24
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,340
most notably all of his supercars.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,580
Well, the incarceration of the Tate brothers has since been extended multiple times, up

26
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,980
to 180 days at this point, and, during this period, more scraps of evidence keep mounting

27
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,640
against them, regarding the sex trafficking allegations.

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,820
The case hinges on proving the Tate brothers employed the loverboy method of sex trafficking,

29
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,580
where you enter into a real relationship with a woman, get her to fall in love with you,

30
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,840
and then once you've moved her to another country, taking her passport and making her

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,180
do sex work.

32
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,900
And in a recently resurfaced interview from November of 2021, you can hear Tristan Tate

33
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,780
say that is exactly what he and his brother have done.

34
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,660
Typically, my setup was, for many, many years, I would approach women and meet them and seduce

35
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,820
them in the old-fashioned way, and within a few months, they were earning money for

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,980
me to make me richer, either on webcam or a platform like OnlyFans or something like that.

37
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,000
So I see myself on a higher level because I distinguish the difference between being

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,980
a customer and being a provider of the service.

39
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,940
You know, I'm the guy who gets money because he has women, not the guy who spends his money

40
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,160
to get women near him.

41
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,640
I can get a beautiful girlfriend and tell her and manage her and drag $40,000 to $50,000

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,120
a month out of thin air.

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,880
If I concentrate all of my effort on one 10 out of 10 female and she'll do whatever I

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,000
say, I can conjure $40,000 or $50,000 a month out of thin air.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And that's what I know how to do.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,780
That's always going to be my default.

47
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,800
I couldn't lose all I have now.

48
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
That isn't possible.

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,360
So many things would have to go wrong.

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,360
But if I did, I'd find a pretty girlfriend and I'd start dragging $50,000 a month out

51
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,720
of thin air and I would build from there.

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,520
You can also hear Tristan Tate talk about how he treats women who try to build up some

53
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,840
side money in an attempt to leave their control.

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,700
The admins need to be people you trust.

55
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,400
Your management and your admins have to be people you trust.

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,780
They absolutely do.

57
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,280
Because if they're not watching your girls and you're not watching them personally, girls

58
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,720
will run wild.

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,320
There are a million ways to take money from a guy who likes this girl.

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,660
So if you let the girl be in charge of her own phone contact with members who like her,

61
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,500
you are setting yourself up to get scammed.

62
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,760
All she has to do is type a sort code and account number to a member.

63
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,720
And that has happened to me before.

64
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,000
I went to the room, smashed the room up, told her I knew what she did.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
She sent me all the money.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,240
But that has happened to me before.

67
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,020
She was talking to this guy online a lot.

68
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,640
She didn't have an admin because she was very successful and very high up doing this on

69
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
her own.

70
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,720
But I noticed her token numbers had fallen down.

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,960
But she was on Skype every day to her best member, a guy who used to tip her loads.

72
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,480
So I was thinking, why is she on Skype to this guy all the time but her token numbers

73
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,020
are low and this guy doesn't seem to be tipping her?

74
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,160
And I got wise to it.

75
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,560
Because she had been talking to him on the phone, she had been getting him to send money

76
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,840
directly to her bank account from his bank account, bank to bank transfers.

77
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,080
Talking to him for one or two hours every day, doing her shift.

78
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,020
But that was money I wasn't seeing a part of.

79
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,840
These girls will scam you.

80
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,000
If you let them take full control over their accounts, they will run away.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,560
I like to keep the girls' passwords.

82
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,260
I log them in and log them out.

83
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,220
If you give the girl the password to her account, there's a chance she could run away and try

84
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,220
it by herself.

85
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,180
I've had that happen.

86
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,420
Girls are usually a lot less successful when they don't have a management structure and

87
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,460
a boss in place because girls are fucking lazy.

88
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,220
They're lazy, they don't want to do the work.

89
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,780
They'll work three or four hours a day and think, oh, that's enough.

90
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,180
So they become very unproductive and you've lost a good potential earner.

91
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,300
So keep the passwords to their accounts, certainly.

92
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,980
Don't let them have direct contact with their members.

93
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,940
Have the admins have direct contact with their members instead.

94
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,300
And make sure you're paying the admins, how you structure your business is up to you,

95
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,380
but pay the admins a percentage on what the girls make.

96
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,380
That way they'll keep the tokens coming into the girls' accounts and they won't try to

97
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,980
scam you themselves.

98
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,380
If a girl is talking to a member in any way, they have their Twitters, they have their

99
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,900
Instagrams, you do have to be wary of it because you can't ban them from having Twitter and

100
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,900
Instagram.

101
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,880
In fact, you need to encourage it because it helps their following on cam.

102
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,480
You need to make sure, have a look at their computer.

103
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,020
I have screen share set up on all the Macs in the house, so when they're on their Facebook

104
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,900
pages, et cetera, sometimes I'm just watching in, not because I'm a weird creep, but because

105
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,660
they talk to members on there.

106
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,940
And they can get Western Union transfers, they can get anything, cash app, PayPals,

107
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,220
they can get anything sent to them that cuts you out and you're not knowledgeable.

108
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,340
So not just members trying to scam girls, that shouldn't be your concern.

109
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,740
It is, but you get wise to their stuff very quickly and if you stick to the don't do anything

110
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,140
until you get the money rule, the members aren't really the threat.

111
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,420
The threat to your business, to your webcam company is the girls.

112
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,060
Watch them like you can't trust women.

113
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,880
You got to watch them like you've got eyes in the back of your head.

114
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,680
You can also hear Andrew Tate talk about how to control women, how it's essential to fuck

115
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,240
your employees to keep them under you, how to control their finances, how it's vital

116
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,500
that they be in love with you.

117
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,180
Truth is this man, before I had this webcam business, I fucked girls, I've got PhD, I've

118
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,540
always been the best, but I never really, I wasn't militant with it.

119
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,660
I'd get a girlfriend, I'd fuck here, there, I didn't really care, but after I started

120
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,020
this business and realized that the only way I can get girls to work for me is to fuck

121
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,540
them first, I became militant.

122
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,260
It became my job to fuck girls.

123
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,140
I was, I was fucking ruthless.

124
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:59,380
I mean, every day I send 20 Instagrams, every day I was on a date, I was fucking four girls,

125
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,620
five girls a week because that's how I made, built my business.

126
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,420
I built my business off the back of my dick.

127
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,420
That's how I built it.

128
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,100
That's how I got rich.

129
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,660
So I became militant with the pimping and my bottom bitch understood it and she understood

130
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,660
that perfectly.

131
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,860
So that is the recruitment structure and that is extremely important.

132
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,500
It's always going to be difficult to manage.

133
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,060
It's never going to be easy for you as a one man to have all these women working for you

134
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,720
because you have to fuck the girls.

135
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,940
This is a fucking super important, you're probably sitting there with a smile on your

136
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,860
face right now, looking at you fuckers, they're all like, yes, you have to fuck the girls.

137
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:43,740
You cannot sit and do a purely professional business relationship with a female.

138
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,820
It doesn't work.

139
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,940
Women have sex with somebody.

140
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,460
If they're not fucking you, they're fucking somebody else.

141
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,500
Now a woman's always going to be the most loyal to the guy she's fucking as opposed

142
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,980
to anyone else for any other reason.

143
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,580
If you have a girl work for you and you say, look, we're going to go to be business partners,

144
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,580
we're going to make money.

145
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,580
Here's your cut.

146
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
Here's my cut.

147
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,580
We're going to work together.

148
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,580
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

149
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
Here's a fucking, I've had dudes.

150
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,980
I've known loads of guys who've like tried to do a contract with a girl, tried to sit

151
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,620
there and talk common sense to a girl.

152
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,620
When's the last time talking common sense to a girl has ever worked ever?

153
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,260
If you're not fucking the girl, she is fucking someone else and that other person she's fucking

154
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,620
is going to have the control over her mind as opposed to you and if he controls her mind

155
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,260
and you don't control her mind, once she starts to pick it up a bit after a few weeks, a few

156
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,700
months, whatever, and realizes how to make money on her own, is she going to stay and

157
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,900
keep paying you or is she going to run off and pay her boyfriend or them to really go

158
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,740
traveling in Southeast Asia and she's going to work as she goes or she's going to go to

159
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,980
her boyfriend and say, look, fuck it, you type for me.

160
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,980
She's going to run off.

161
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,820
She's going to leave.

162
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,180
There's no way I've been doing, I did this business for a long time.

163
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,300
There's no such thing as having girls who work for you who you've not fucked.

164
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,660
It's impossible.

165
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,700
You have to fuck them and they have to love you.

166
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,620
It's essential to the business because otherwise women have no loyalty.

167
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,420
If you sit and say to a man, look, I'm going to show you how to make unlimited money on

168
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,900
your computer from home and we're going to do it together and after a few months he can

169
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,420
do on his own, he'll still sit there and go, yeah, but we started this together, so let's

170
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,420
just stick at it together.

171
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,060
Women showed me how without him, I wouldn't have any of this, so I'll give him his cup.

172
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,060
Women don't think that way.

173
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,060
Women don't have any loyalty like that.

174
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,060
They'll think, oh, fuck it.

175
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,060
I can do it without him now.

176
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,060
Fuck him.

177
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,060
And they'll run off.

178
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,060
Women are snakes.

179
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,700
They have to be in love with you, which means you have to have sex with them.

180
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,260
So this is why your Bolton bitch is so important because your Bolton bitch is going to be there

181
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,420
from the beginning and if you ever want to grow the business, you have to be having sex

182
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,380
with other women and your Bolton bitch has to understand that.

183
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,940
So the dynamic you pull there with your number one girl, your Bolton bitch, your first girl

184
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,060
is after you've been working a few weeks or whatever, whatever, after things are going

185
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,140
well, you'd say to her, you know what, me and you can get even richer and she'll say

186
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:09,140
how and you'll say, if me and you got some other girls, me and you, not me, if me and

187
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,460
you got some other girls to work, then we'd have even more money and also what we could

188
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,020
do is I could give you a percentage of their money so you could teach them and train them

189
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,340
to be like you and I can give you a cup of their money as well so you have more money

190
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,900
as well and we can buy a house and buy a car and we can invest in crypto, whatever, sell

191
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,860
them a dream, sell them some dream and we'll then buy this big property in fucking the

192
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,340
Bahamas and she'll go, oh yeah, but where are we going to find girls from?

193
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,540
Say, well, I'm going to find the girl and I'm going to bring her to you and you can

194
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,540
tell her how good it is to work for me and how great it is to do this webcamming thing

195
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,960
and how smart we are.

196
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,620
I don't mention webcam until after I've had sex with the girl.

197
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,300
If you're on dates and you're trying to mention it and shit, it just doesn't work.

198
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,300
It puts them off.

199
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,300
I'd never do that.

200
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,300
That's disgusting.

201
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,300
I'm not a whore.

202
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,020
It's just not going to work.

203
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,220
You continue as normal, no mention of webcam.

204
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,220
You fuck the girl.

205
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,660
After you fuck the girl, you do the PhD test.

206
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,160
If she passes the PhD test and she wants to be with you, then you start mentioning things

207
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,100
like, yeah, but you know, you're always busy.

208
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
You're always at work.

209
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
You can come work for me.

210
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,580
Or if you're doing what?

211
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,580
Say, well, I have a webcam business.

212
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,580
Oh, I don't want to do that.

213
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,580
Okay.

214
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
I know you don't want to do that, but listen.

215
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,580
Come, let's have a meeting.

216
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,580
Let's just talk about it.

217
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
If you don't want to do it, don't do it.

218
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,580
Fine.

219
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,580
But let me explain it to you properly.

220
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,220
In fact, I'll bring one of the girls who works with me.

221
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,500
You, your bottom bitch, the new girl, you go out for fucking a nice dinner.

222
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,180
Your bottom bitch is the one who does the selling.

223
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,700
You don't do the selling.

224
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,020
The girl has to hear from a girl and this is where your bottom bitch has to be trained.

225
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,580
So I said, it's so important to have a good first girl.

226
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,580
My first girl was so good.

227
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,060
It was easy.

228
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,060
My girls had to go, Oh my God, before this, I was a waitress and it was shit.

229
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,060
And now I do this.

230
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,500
I make so much money and the guys all love me and they adore me and on my birthday they

231
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
send me presents.

232
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
I get so much money, blah, blah, blah.

233
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
And it's so much fun.

234
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,660
And we stay at home and dah, dah, dah, dah, or we're gonna go to Thailand soon or we'll

235
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,180
be working in Thailand and we're stay there for as long as we want.

236
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
You should come with us.

237
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,180
It's gonna be so much fun.

238
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,180
Dah, dah, dah, dah.

239
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,180
Martinis, martinis, martinis, bang, threesome.

240
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,180
Slam them both.

241
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,260
Your bottom bitch knows this girl's like, okay, well I'll try it.

242
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,340
Put both girls on camera together the first day.

243
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
So the new girl can sit there and just sit with the other girl and get drunk.

244
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,620
Give them a bottle of vodka, put on the fucking chatterbait, a hundred tokens per shot.

245
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,300
The guys will send loads of money to get the girls drunk because guys like drunk girls.

246
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,300
Girls will sit there, get drunk, have a great time and say, it's your new job now.

247
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,300
You haven't got to work ever again.

248
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,460
That's how you recruit girls.

249
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,700
And then there's the Tate's War Room, which is the most expensive, most inner circle of

250
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,780
Hustler University, which is basically another of those online universities where you pay

251
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,900
the influencer at the top to get simple tips on how to self-improve and motivational talks

252
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,980
and other nonsense like that.

253
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,420
Kind of like Jack Murphy's Liminal Order, which Andrew Tate claimed was ripped off from

254
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,420
him, by the way.

255
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,300
Well, the War Room's logs have been leaked.

256
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,100
They show that the guys in the War Room talk about using the loverboy method, just like

257
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,060
the Tate's, to recruit women into prostitution, take their money and beat them, just like

258
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,060
they were taught.

259
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,380
A lot of those previous video clips come from War Room tutorials and talks.

260
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,380
These same War Room guys are also all running sock puppet accounts, using very similar branding

261
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,420
to promote Andrew Tate clips and messages all across the internet.

262
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,160
All these accounts have been made three to four months ago around the same time.

263
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,860
It seems like every few days, there's another article with another girl's story about how

264
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,920
she was lured to Romania by the Tate's.

265
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,480
It seems to be the case that a good chunk of the girls did not want to be there.

266
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,760
They were there under threat of violence, including some that might be under 18.

267
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,940
Here's one girl's anonymous testimony.

268
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,620
We were just sitting on the bed and Andrew punched me in my arm.

269
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,940
I went to the bathroom and cried.

270
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,340
It really, really hurt to have someone just hit me in the arm for no reason.

271
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,340
I was very confused.

272
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,340
Sorry.

273
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,380
Sorry, I don't want to cry.

274
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,380
It's OK.

275
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:03,380
I just witnessed so much, like verbal, physical, not just to me, but the other women involved,

276
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,460
and it just got worse over time.

277
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:12,200
I saw him smack girls with a belt because she wanted a lion.

278
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:26,340
He used to strangle us as well.

279
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,340
There was another time when he came into the bedroom.

280
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,140
Me and the other girl, we would sleep in the same bed with Andrew, but at this time the

281
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,080
girl had a partner, so she was not interested in Andrew at all.

282
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,500
And I had gone to the shower, I came back and I noticed he was, like, I saw him raping

283
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
her.

284
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,820
And that being said, there are girls who are still loyal to the Tates, who are saying that

285
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,820
they're all there consensually.

286
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,900
And you can hear their testimony too.

287
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:58,020
I, uh, I would also like to say, I think it's pretty embarrassing that nine months after

288
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:04,380
the first raid in April last year, we gave our statement in which clearly we said we

289
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,780
weren't the victims.

290
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:11,500
It wasn't until a couple of days ago, I think, yeah, a couple of days ago that we found out

291
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
about the whole situation.

292
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,660
So I'm pretty annoyed and upset.

293
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:22,060
So your opinion and also the paratrist's opinion is that the brother states are very honest

294
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,940
and they don't do...

295
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:31,020
I honestly think that justice should be made, because this is very unfair.

296
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,740
They don't deserve it.

297
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,820
Uh, those are just made up stories that go around the internet.

298
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,780
If you don't have, I don't understand if you, we've been, the prosecutors, we're victims

299
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,780
in this case.

300
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,560
When we obviously declared we are not the victim.

301
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,140
And that happened in April of last year, right?

302
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:56,620
So this case is basically built on lies in my opinion.

303
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,660
How can I trust the Romanian authorities?

304
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,920
How can I trust their words?

305
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,040
It does seem to be the case, however, that these girls are the bottom bitches, prostitution

306
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,500
parlance for women who are at the top of the pecking order, who help a pimp recruit and

307
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,300
control other women, enforce order and collect money.

308
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,340
And there are in fact videos of the Tate's bottom bitches doing exactly that.

309
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:23,020
Is this what's been counted so far?

310
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:30,220
Because it takes like 76,000.

311
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,220
And that's been counted or not?

312
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,980
Not yet.

313
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,580
The funniest part about all of this is, is that part of the court proceedings, if Google

314
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,100
Translate is to be believed, shows that the judge in this case is specifically looking

315
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,380
at all of the shit the Tate's have said online and using it as justification for holding

316
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,240
them and the investigation and all of it.

317
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,100
It turns out, guys, the Tate's are not smart people.

318
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,360
If they were, they would have shut the fuck up.

319
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,180
They would absolutely shut the fuck up when in jail and not order their underlings on

320
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,340
the outside to start destroying evidence.

321
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,140
Yes, they were actually dumb enough to do that, at least according to this translated

322
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,180
Romanian article.

323
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,580
You know that in jail cells and visitation rooms, they listen to you, right?

324
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,460
You know that the Romanian government can translate what you say, right?

325
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,180
The Tate's are fucking retarded.

326
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,180
And this confirms it.

327
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,940
The world is full of Andrew Tate simps right now, filming the hashtag free top G and whatever.

328
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,580
And a lot of them are just sad, lonely dudes who are ignored by the mainstream progressive

329
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,580
apparatus.

330
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,820
The left had nothing to tell these people except that they were the source of all the

331
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,820
world's problems.

332
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,420
So I'm not surprised that they ran into the arms of the only person who actually offered

333
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,140
them an empowering perspective, despite the toxicity.

334
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,740
But you don't want to be Andrew Tate, man.

335
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,780
Even disregarding that he is probably going to pound you in the ass prison for the rest

336
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,700
of his life, the hedonistic lifestyle stops being fun for most people pretty quick.

337
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,340
Disposable women won't make you happy like a real relationship will.

338
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,420
Despite this, there's a bunch of rightoid influencers who are constantly running interference

339
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,420
for him.

340
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,980
Mike Cernovich, yeah, from the Gamergate days, was heavily involved in the war room.

341
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,700
Candace Owens and Paul Joseph Watson have both gone to bat for him, mainly because they're

342
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,340
all anti-woke and they know him personally.

343
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,400
I have to believe because of how public of a figure that Andrew Tate has been, because

344
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,600
of how honest he has been about his expectations and relationships and in his views of the

345
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,380
women that he is with or what he would do in a scenario if he was dating a girl that

346
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:24,000
did this or that, that the women that were messaging Andrew Tate, engaging in conversations

347
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,940
with Andrew Tate on the internet, on Instagram, via direct messaging, knew what they were

348
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,380
getting into.

349
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:38,420
And I feel that that is important to say because I am so sick of this idea by that we should

350
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,100
always accept that in every situation a woman is a victim.

351
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,600
I'm not empowered by that.

352
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,180
I don't find that to be empowering, right?

353
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,600
The Me Too movement to me disempowered women because it said, women never know what they're

354
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
doing.

355
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,220
They just are always little flowers and men take advantage.

356
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,160
The truth is that women take advantage too.

357
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,060
And the easiest thing for women to sell to get what they want is sex, right?

358
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,420
This is what tagless sponsor proves.

359
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,460
I want to be rich.

360
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,300
I want to have money and I don't want to work, so I'm going to sell sex.

361
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:10,520
I have no talent and I want to be an actress, so I'm going to sell sex.

362
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,220
With Paul Joseph Watson actually being one of the simps that watches some of Tate's girls.

363
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,140
This bitch next to you, she's not attractive, right?

364
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,740
I'm sure she's a nice girl, but she's not hot.

365
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,740
She's rubbish.

366
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:29,180
I mean, what can you get away with, like what is the most extreme physical act that you

367
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,180
can perform?

368
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:45,340
And there's no end to the video clips of Andrew Tate's American lawyer running interference

369
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,460
for him in the English-speaking media.

370
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,040
Or his manager saying, hey guys, everything's actually okay.

371
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,180
Of course you would say that.

372
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,340
You're his fucking manager.

373
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,740
You're getting paid to push the pro-Tate position.

374
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,740
That's your job.

375
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,620
In fact, in so far as Andrew Tate's manager is concerned, the funniest bit has to do with

376
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,140
the Vice expose.

377
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,260
Vice sent a reporter to Romania to hang out with Andrew Tate for a while, which he stupidly

378
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,260
agreed to.

379
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,260
Again, the Tates are stupid.

380
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,420
They had to know that this was an investigation into their actions by a media company.

381
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,420
That's what they're there for.

382
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,420
It's fucking Vice, dude.

383
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,420
We all know what they're about.

384
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,660
Well, the Tate's manager had this to say about it on a Twitter space.

385
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:22,340
What would you say is the biggest misrepresentation made in that Vice interview?

386
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,660
Okay, thanks for the question.

387
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,460
I'd say the biggest misrepresentation, first of all, is Matt himself.

388
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,180
When you interact with him, pretty regular guy, in front of the camera, he was always,

389
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,560
I'm timid, I'm a little bit scared, all these big bad guys around me.

390
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,840
When the camera's off, he's laughing, he's shaking hands, he's having a good time.

391
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,940
He himself was acting a certain role for the camera.

392
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,260
To me, that's the biggest lack of congruence.

393
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,420
The guy is lying.

394
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,980
He was having fun, he was smiling, he was laughing, he was joking.

395
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:53,700
Then when the camera went on and we noticed it, he goes into this timid, all these bad

396
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,140
men around me and they're doing violent things.

397
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,880
When the event comes out, it's just pure hit job.

398
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
These guys are evil.

399
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
It was a joke.

400
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,580
At the end of it, when he'd already got all the footage he wanted, he was still saying

401
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,140
positive things because the reality is it was a very positive event and he took part

402
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,140
in it.

403
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,500
He was welcomed into it and he benefited from it.

404
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,220
How naive is this fucking guy?

405
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,700
Yeah, he's there to do a job, dude.

406
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,200
He's there to ask the hard questions.

407
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,340
I know Vice definitely puts out some shit-ribbed reporting sometimes, but this is exactly what

408
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,700
a reporter should be doing.

409
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,240
The fact that he's nice to you personally does not mean that you've bought his undying

410
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,480
fucking loyalty.

411
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,920
Speaking of Vice, probably the biggest bit of copium I've heard comes from the Fresh

412
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,180
and Fit podcast.

413
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,180
Listen to this insanity.

414
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,840
Really, this whole situation, it's just so slimy.

415
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,760
What Vice is doing, they're really living up to that filthy media production company

416
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
that they own.

417
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Oh, yeah.

418
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,920
And do you know it's 44% owned by George Soros?

419
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Oh, shit.

420
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Are you serious?

421
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
Yeah.

422
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
Damn.

423
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,480
The Soros Fund, 44% owner in Vice Media.

424
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Holy fuck, dude.

425
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,000
Well, that explains a lot.

426
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah.

427
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,600
I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist or not, whatever the case may be, but I mean,

428
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
you know.

429
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Yeah, there are no coincidences.

430
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Coincidences, dude.

431
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,640
Yeah, because Vice is 44% owned by the George Soros Fund, they're clearly not capable of

432
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,560
reporting on Andrew Tate in a neutral way.

433
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,580
The Deep State, The Matrix, or whatever is coming for him.

434
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,880
George Soros is giving the orders himself, guys, except this numbskull doesn't know how

435
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,340
to fucking read.

436
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,400
Here's where he got that 44% number from, and I guess he just couldn't parse this list

437
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,000
because the 44% actually goes to TPG Capital.

438
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,260
Soros Fund management only owns 10%.

439
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:31,020
As a final Hail Mary, Andrew Tate decided to play the cancer card.

440
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,560
A few days ago, a bunch of his followers all dropped at once the claim that Andrew Tate

441
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,840
has lung cancer and that his lawyer is petitioning for a compassionate release so he could leave

442
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,320
Romania and get treatment.

443
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,520
Of course, the countries with the best cancer specialists, it turns out, are all countries

444
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,580
with no extradition treaties to Romania.

445
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,440
But a subsequent investigation has shown that although Andrew Tate does have a tumor, a

446
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,580
biopsy has confirmed that it is in fact benign, not cancerous.

447
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,200
So Andrew Tate is going to trial.

448
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,120
At the end of the day, the Tates prey on lonely men.

449
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,800
They don't help them, they exploit them.

450
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,280
They take their money through Hustler University and they take it through webcam donations.

451
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,040
There's a crowd of aimless young men out there and the progressives have entirely vilified

452
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
and abandoned.

453
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,560
And they've been driven right into the arms of somebody who is just as bad.

454
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:20,360
It's no surprise to me that we're starting to see scenes like this out there.

455
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,740
And that's not even mentioning how bad the Tates are to women.

456
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,520
These are not good dudes, guys.

457
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,280
They're not who you want to emulate.

458
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,080
They're not who you want to hold up as anti-woke heroes or some shit.

459
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,780
Rhytoids are stuck in this rut right now of simply accepting anything that is anti-left,

460
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,280
regardless of whether or not it's actually, you know, good.

461
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,280
And that has led to an alarming rise of people who are pro-Tate.

462
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,160
Hell, I know this doesn't mean much, since anybody can cite anything as a reason for

463
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
their madness.

464
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,760
But we've even got an Andrew Tate shooter now, at least an attempted shooter.

465
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,600
On January 5th, 2023, a 19-year-old Florida man, yes, Florida man, was arrested for threatening

466
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,000
a mass shooting at Florida State University.

467
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,440
He posted online a picture of his AR-15, as well as the address of the university, along

468
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,800
with the message, faggots will die, under the name BloodstainedSand0088.

469
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,720
He claimed the post was a joke, meant to get laughs in a Discord server.

470
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
And it might have been.

471
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,480
But he also has a previous record of violence and aggressive confrontation.

472
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,040
And yes, his Twitter account history showed him liking almost exclusively tons of Andrew

473
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,280
Tate content.

474
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,960
As I say with any other shooter that I talk about on this channel, the YouTuber or streamer

475
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,320
or whatever that a shooter watches is not really responsible for what the shooter does.

476
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,840
So I don't feel comfortable pinning this on Andrew Tate, but he's clearly not a good person.

477
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,280
I've felt that there was a significant values difference between myself and the people who

478
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,360
are actually on the right wing, such that I am not a right winger, and I never have

479
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,800
been, despite what leftists say.

480
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,560
And don't worry, I'm not a left winger either.

481
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,760
The unapologetic throwing that right wingers give to a scumbag like Andrew Tate all but

482
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,720
confirms that I'm not one of them.

483
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,640
Jokes aside, I will certainly never be a fucking communist.

484
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,680
But if this is what the right is nowadays, then I don't want any part of it.
