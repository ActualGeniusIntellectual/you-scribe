0	9040	It's time to talk about Andrew Tate again, for the third time in fact.
9040	13580	I really should just make this into a semi-regular mini-series, I'll call it The Uptate, haha.
13580	17420	I gave a basic overview about Andrew Tate on the TUBcast a while ago.
17420	21440	I also did a second video on him, going over his history as a fighter, his transition into
21440	25200	a celebrity role after he aged out of fighting, the creation of his webcam business, where
25200	28900	he employed some pretty shady behavior, and his poor treatment of women all throughout.
28900	32560	But there is some new info since the last time I talked about him, that we should probably
32560	33560	check out.
33560	36940	And just so we're clear, the latest news in this story doesn't involve Andrew Tate's
36940	39860	hairline receding faster than the Ukrainian border.
39860	42860	These pictures were taken after he'd been in prison for a while, and enabled to keep
42860	43900	his head shaved.
43900	47300	Andrew Tate claimed once that he chose to be bald, but I have a feeling that he didn't
47300	48700	really have any other choice.
48700	54180	No, the newest Andrew Tate news has to do, primarily, with how his legal case is progressing.
54180	57620	If you'll recall, his home in Romania was raided by the cops, who currently have him
57620	61360	locked away pending further investigation, as he is considered a flight risk.
61360	64540	Good thing, too, as it came out that the Tates were in the middle of planning to flee to
64540	66040	Dubai when they were caught.
66040	70220	The body cam footage of the home raid showed money, passports, and weapons laying around
70220	73020	the Tate's pad, as well as a gorilla made of cash.
73020	75660	I guess the rich really do have some strange tastes.
75660	79580	Unfortunately for them, a lot of that stuff has since been seized by the Romanian state,
79580	81340	most notably all of his supercars.
81340	85580	Well, the incarceration of the Tate brothers has since been extended multiple times, up
85580	90980	to 180 days at this point, and, during this period, more scraps of evidence keep mounting
90980	93640	against them, regarding the sex trafficking allegations.
93640	97820	The case hinges on proving the Tate brothers employed the loverboy method of sex trafficking,
97820	101580	where you enter into a real relationship with a woman, get her to fall in love with you,
101580	104840	and then once you've moved her to another country, taking her passport and making her
104840	106180	do sex work.
106180	110900	And in a recently resurfaced interview from November of 2021, you can hear Tristan Tate
110900	113780	say that is exactly what he and his brother have done.
113980	117660	Typically, my setup was, for many, many years, I would approach women and meet them and seduce
117660	121820	them in the old-fashioned way, and within a few months, they were earning money for
121820	125980	me to make me richer, either on webcam or a platform like OnlyFans or something like that.
125980	130000	So I see myself on a higher level because I distinguish the difference between being
130000	132980	a customer and being a provider of the service.
132980	136940	You know, I'm the guy who gets money because he has women, not the guy who spends his money
136940	138160	to get women near him.
138160	145640	I can get a beautiful girlfriend and tell her and manage her and drag $40,000 to $50,000
145640	147120	a month out of thin air.
147120	151880	If I concentrate all of my effort on one 10 out of 10 female and she'll do whatever I
151880	157000	say, I can conjure $40,000 or $50,000 a month out of thin air.
157000	159000	And that's what I know how to do.
159000	160780	That's always going to be my default.
160780	162800	I couldn't lose all I have now.
162800	163800	That isn't possible.
163800	165360	So many things would have to go wrong.
165360	170360	But if I did, I'd find a pretty girlfriend and I'd start dragging $50,000 a month out
170360	172720	of thin air and I would build from there.
172720	176520	You can also hear Tristan Tate talk about how he treats women who try to build up some
176520	178840	side money in an attempt to leave their control.
178840	181700	The admins need to be people you trust.
181700	185400	Your management and your admins have to be people you trust.
185400	187780	They absolutely do.
187780	192280	Because if they're not watching your girls and you're not watching them personally, girls
192280	193720	will run wild.
193720	198320	There are a million ways to take money from a guy who likes this girl.
198320	204660	So if you let the girl be in charge of her own phone contact with members who like her,
204660	206500	you are setting yourself up to get scammed.
206500	210760	All she has to do is type a sort code and account number to a member.
210760	212720	And that has happened to me before.
212720	219000	I went to the room, smashed the room up, told her I knew what she did.
219000	220000	She sent me all the money.
220000	221240	But that has happened to me before.
221240	225020	She was talking to this guy online a lot.
225020	228640	She didn't have an admin because she was very successful and very high up doing this on
228640	229640	her own.
229640	231720	But I noticed her token numbers had fallen down.
231720	235960	But she was on Skype every day to her best member, a guy who used to tip her loads.
235960	241480	So I was thinking, why is she on Skype to this guy all the time but her token numbers
241480	244020	are low and this guy doesn't seem to be tipping her?
244020	245160	And I got wise to it.
245160	249560	Because she had been talking to him on the phone, she had been getting him to send money
249560	255840	directly to her bank account from his bank account, bank to bank transfers.
255840	258080	Talking to him for one or two hours every day, doing her shift.
258080	261020	But that was money I wasn't seeing a part of.
261020	262840	These girls will scam you.
262840	269000	If you let them take full control over their accounts, they will run away.
269000	270560	I like to keep the girls' passwords.
270560	272260	I log them in and log them out.
272260	275220	If you give the girl the password to her account, there's a chance she could run away and try
275220	276220	it by herself.
276220	278180	I've had that happen.
278180	281420	Girls are usually a lot less successful when they don't have a management structure and
281420	284460	a boss in place because girls are fucking lazy.
284460	286220	They're lazy, they don't want to do the work.
286220	288780	They'll work three or four hours a day and think, oh, that's enough.
288780	293180	So they become very unproductive and you've lost a good potential earner.
293180	296300	So keep the passwords to their accounts, certainly.
296300	298980	Don't let them have direct contact with their members.
298980	303940	Have the admins have direct contact with their members instead.
303940	307300	And make sure you're paying the admins, how you structure your business is up to you,
307300	310380	but pay the admins a percentage on what the girls make.
310380	313380	That way they'll keep the tokens coming into the girls' accounts and they won't try to
313380	316980	scam you themselves.
316980	320380	If a girl is talking to a member in any way, they have their Twitters, they have their
320380	324900	Instagrams, you do have to be wary of it because you can't ban them from having Twitter and
324900	325900	Instagram.
325900	328880	In fact, you need to encourage it because it helps their following on cam.
328880	333480	You need to make sure, have a look at their computer.
333480	337020	I have screen share set up on all the Macs in the house, so when they're on their Facebook
337060	341900	pages, et cetera, sometimes I'm just watching in, not because I'm a weird creep, but because
341900	343660	they talk to members on there.
343660	349940	And they can get Western Union transfers, they can get anything, cash app, PayPals,
349940	354220	they can get anything sent to them that cuts you out and you're not knowledgeable.
354220	359340	So not just members trying to scam girls, that shouldn't be your concern.
359340	364740	It is, but you get wise to their stuff very quickly and if you stick to the don't do anything
364740	368140	until you get the money rule, the members aren't really the threat.
368140	373420	The threat to your business, to your webcam company is the girls.
373420	376060	Watch them like you can't trust women.
376060	378880	You got to watch them like you've got eyes in the back of your head.
378880	382680	You can also hear Andrew Tate talk about how to control women, how it's essential to fuck
382680	386240	your employees to keep them under you, how to control their finances, how it's vital
386240	388500	that they be in love with you.
388500	393180	Truth is this man, before I had this webcam business, I fucked girls, I've got PhD, I've
393180	397540	always been the best, but I never really, I wasn't militant with it.
397540	402660	I'd get a girlfriend, I'd fuck here, there, I didn't really care, but after I started
402660	406020	this business and realized that the only way I can get girls to work for me is to fuck
406020	408540	them first, I became militant.
408540	411260	It became my job to fuck girls.
411260	413140	I was, I was fucking ruthless.
413140	419380	I mean, every day I send 20 Instagrams, every day I was on a date, I was fucking four girls,
419380	422620	five girls a week because that's how I made, built my business.
422660	424420	I built my business off the back of my dick.
424420	425420	That's how I built it.
425420	427100	That's how I got rich.
427100	433660	So I became militant with the pimping and my bottom bitch understood it and she understood
433660	434660	that perfectly.
434660	437860	So that is the recruitment structure and that is extremely important.
437860	439500	It's always going to be difficult to manage.
439500	444060	It's never going to be easy for you as a one man to have all these women working for you
444060	448720	because you have to fuck the girls.
448720	451940	This is a fucking super important, you're probably sitting there with a smile on your
451980	456860	face right now, looking at you fuckers, they're all like, yes, you have to fuck the girls.
456860	463740	You cannot sit and do a purely professional business relationship with a female.
463740	465820	It doesn't work.
465820	469940	Women have sex with somebody.
469940	472460	If they're not fucking you, they're fucking somebody else.
472460	476500	Now a woman's always going to be the most loyal to the guy she's fucking as opposed
476500	477980	to anyone else for any other reason.
477980	482580	If you have a girl work for you and you say, look, we're going to go to be business partners,
482580	483580	we're going to make money.
483580	484580	Here's your cut.
484580	485580	Here's my cut.
485580	486580	We're going to work together.
486580	487580	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
487580	488580	Here's a fucking, I've had dudes.
488580	493980	I've known loads of guys who've like tried to do a contract with a girl, tried to sit
493980	495620	there and talk common sense to a girl.
495620	499620	When's the last time talking common sense to a girl has ever worked ever?
499620	504260	If you're not fucking the girl, she is fucking someone else and that other person she's fucking
504260	509620	is going to have the control over her mind as opposed to you and if he controls her mind
509620	514260	and you don't control her mind, once she starts to pick it up a bit after a few weeks, a few
514260	518700	months, whatever, and realizes how to make money on her own, is she going to stay and
518700	522900	keep paying you or is she going to run off and pay her boyfriend or them to really go
522900	526740	traveling in Southeast Asia and she's going to work as she goes or she's going to go to
526740	530980	her boyfriend and say, look, fuck it, you type for me.
530980	531980	She's going to run off.
531980	533820	She's going to leave.
533820	537180	There's no way I've been doing, I did this business for a long time.
537180	541300	There's no such thing as having girls who work for you who you've not fucked.
541300	542660	It's impossible.
542660	545700	You have to fuck them and they have to love you.
545700	550620	It's essential to the business because otherwise women have no loyalty.
550620	553420	If you sit and say to a man, look, I'm going to show you how to make unlimited money on
553420	557900	your computer from home and we're going to do it together and after a few months he can
557900	561420	do on his own, he'll still sit there and go, yeah, but we started this together, so let's
561420	562420	just stick at it together.
562420	566060	Women showed me how without him, I wouldn't have any of this, so I'll give him his cup.
566060	567060	Women don't think that way.
567060	568060	Women don't have any loyalty like that.
568060	569060	They'll think, oh, fuck it.
569060	570060	I can do it without him now.
570060	571060	Fuck him.
571060	572060	And they'll run off.
572060	573060	Women are snakes.
573060	576700	They have to be in love with you, which means you have to have sex with them.
576700	581260	So this is why your Bolton bitch is so important because your Bolton bitch is going to be there
581260	585420	from the beginning and if you ever want to grow the business, you have to be having sex
585420	589380	with other women and your Bolton bitch has to understand that.
589420	593940	So the dynamic you pull there with your number one girl, your Bolton bitch, your first girl
593940	598060	is after you've been working a few weeks or whatever, whatever, after things are going
598060	602140	well, you'd say to her, you know what, me and you can get even richer and she'll say
602140	609140	how and you'll say, if me and you got some other girls, me and you, not me, if me and
609140	614460	you got some other girls to work, then we'd have even more money and also what we could
614460	618020	do is I could give you a percentage of their money so you could teach them and train them
618020	621340	to be like you and I can give you a cup of their money as well so you have more money
621340	625900	as well and we can buy a house and buy a car and we can invest in crypto, whatever, sell
625900	629860	them a dream, sell them some dream and we'll then buy this big property in fucking the
629860	633340	Bahamas and she'll go, oh yeah, but where are we going to find girls from?
633340	636540	Say, well, I'm going to find the girl and I'm going to bring her to you and you can
636540	640540	tell her how good it is to work for me and how great it is to do this webcamming thing
640540	641960	and how smart we are.
641960	647620	I don't mention webcam until after I've had sex with the girl.
647620	651300	If you're on dates and you're trying to mention it and shit, it just doesn't work.
651300	652300	It puts them off.
652300	653300	I'd never do that.
653300	654300	That's disgusting.
654300	655300	I'm not a whore.
655300	658020	It's just not going to work.
658020	662220	You continue as normal, no mention of webcam.
662220	663220	You fuck the girl.
663220	666660	After you fuck the girl, you do the PhD test.
666660	672160	If she passes the PhD test and she wants to be with you, then you start mentioning things
672160	675100	like, yeah, but you know, you're always busy.
675100	676100	You're always at work.
676100	677100	You can come work for me.
677580	678580	Or if you're doing what?
678580	679580	Say, well, I have a webcam business.
679580	680580	Oh, I don't want to do that.
680580	681580	Okay.
681580	682580	I know you don't want to do that, but listen.
682580	683580	Come, let's have a meeting.
683580	684580	Let's just talk about it.
684580	685580	If you don't want to do it, don't do it.
685580	686580	Fine.
686580	687580	But let me explain it to you properly.
687580	690220	In fact, I'll bring one of the girls who works with me.
690220	694500	You, your bottom bitch, the new girl, you go out for fucking a nice dinner.
694500	697180	Your bottom bitch is the one who does the selling.
697180	698700	You don't do the selling.
698700	702020	The girl has to hear from a girl and this is where your bottom bitch has to be trained.
702020	705580	So I said, it's so important to have a good first girl.
705580	706580	My first girl was so good.
707060	708060	It was easy.
708060	710060	My girls had to go, Oh my God, before this, I was a waitress and it was shit.
710060	711060	And now I do this.
711060	714500	I make so much money and the guys all love me and they adore me and on my birthday they
714500	715500	send me presents.
715500	716500	I get so much money, blah, blah, blah.
716500	717500	And it's so much fun.
717500	720660	And we stay at home and dah, dah, dah, dah, or we're gonna go to Thailand soon or we'll
720660	723180	be working in Thailand and we're stay there for as long as we want.
723180	724180	You should come with us.
724180	725180	It's gonna be so much fun.
725180	726180	Dah, dah, dah, dah.
726180	728180	Martinis, martinis, martinis, bang, threesome.
728180	730180	Slam them both.
730180	733260	Your bottom bitch knows this girl's like, okay, well I'll try it.
733260	736340	Put both girls on camera together the first day.
737100	739100	So the new girl can sit there and just sit with the other girl and get drunk.
739100	744620	Give them a bottle of vodka, put on the fucking chatterbait, a hundred tokens per shot.
744620	748300	The guys will send loads of money to get the girls drunk because guys like drunk girls.
748300	751300	Girls will sit there, get drunk, have a great time and say, it's your new job now.
751300	752300	You haven't got to work ever again.
752300	754460	That's how you recruit girls.
754460	758700	And then there's the Tate's War Room, which is the most expensive, most inner circle of
758700	762780	Hustler University, which is basically another of those online universities where you pay
762780	766900	the influencer at the top to get simple tips on how to self-improve and motivational talks
766900	767980	and other nonsense like that.
767980	771420	Kind of like Jack Murphy's Liminal Order, which Andrew Tate claimed was ripped off from
771420	772420	him, by the way.
772420	774300	Well, the War Room's logs have been leaked.
774300	778100	They show that the guys in the War Room talk about using the loverboy method, just like
778100	782060	the Tate's, to recruit women into prostitution, take their money and beat them, just like
782060	783060	they were taught.
783060	787380	A lot of those previous video clips come from War Room tutorials and talks.
787380	792380	These same War Room guys are also all running sock puppet accounts, using very similar branding
792380	795420	to promote Andrew Tate clips and messages all across the internet.
795420	798160	All these accounts have been made three to four months ago around the same time.
798160	801860	It seems like every few days, there's another article with another girl's story about how
801860	803920	she was lured to Romania by the Tate's.
803920	807480	It seems to be the case that a good chunk of the girls did not want to be there.
807480	811760	They were there under threat of violence, including some that might be under 18.
811760	813940	Here's one girl's anonymous testimony.
813940	818620	We were just sitting on the bed and Andrew punched me in my arm.
818620	820940	I went to the bathroom and cried.
820940	824340	It really, really hurt to have someone just hit me in the arm for no reason.
824340	826340	I was very confused.
826340	827340	Sorry.
827340	831380	Sorry, I don't want to cry.
831380	834380	It's OK.
834380	843380	I just witnessed so much, like verbal, physical, not just to me, but the other women involved,
843380	845460	and it just got worse over time.
845460	852200	I saw him smack girls with a belt because she wanted a lion.
852200	866340	He used to strangle us as well.
866340	870340	There was another time when he came into the bedroom.
870340	874140	Me and the other girl, we would sleep in the same bed with Andrew, but at this time the
874140	878080	girl had a partner, so she was not interested in Andrew at all.
878080	883500	And I had gone to the shower, I came back and I noticed he was, like, I saw him raping
883500	884500	her.
884500	888820	And that being said, there are girls who are still loyal to the Tates, who are saying that
888820	889820	they're all there consensually.
889820	891900	And you can hear their testimony too.
891900	898020	I, uh, I would also like to say, I think it's pretty embarrassing that nine months after
898020	904380	the first raid in April last year, we gave our statement in which clearly we said we
904380	905780	weren't the victims.
905780	911500	It wasn't until a couple of days ago, I think, yeah, a couple of days ago that we found out
911500	912500	about the whole situation.
912500	914660	So I'm pretty annoyed and upset.
914660	922060	So your opinion and also the paratrist's opinion is that the brother states are very honest
922060	924940	and they don't do...
924940	931020	I honestly think that justice should be made, because this is very unfair.
931020	932740	They don't deserve it.
932740	937820	Uh, those are just made up stories that go around the internet.
937820	943780	If you don't have, I don't understand if you, we've been, the prosecutors, we're victims
943780	944780	in this case.
944780	947560	When we obviously declared we are not the victim.
947560	951140	And that happened in April of last year, right?
951140	956620	So this case is basically built on lies in my opinion.
956620	959660	How can I trust the Romanian authorities?
959660	961920	How can I trust their words?
961920	966040	It does seem to be the case, however, that these girls are the bottom bitches, prostitution
966040	969500	parlance for women who are at the top of the pecking order, who help a pimp recruit and
969500	972300	control other women, enforce order and collect money.
972300	977340	And there are in fact videos of the Tate's bottom bitches doing exactly that.
977340	983020	Is this what's been counted so far?
983020	990220	Because it takes like 76,000.
990220	993220	And that's been counted or not?
993220	995980	Not yet.
995980	999580	The funniest part about all of this is, is that part of the court proceedings, if Google
999580	1004100	Translate is to be believed, shows that the judge in this case is specifically looking
1004100	1008380	at all of the shit the Tate's have said online and using it as justification for holding
1008380	1010240	them and the investigation and all of it.
1010240	1013100	It turns out, guys, the Tate's are not smart people.
1013100	1015360	If they were, they would have shut the fuck up.
1015360	1020180	They would absolutely shut the fuck up when in jail and not order their underlings on
1020180	1022340	the outside to start destroying evidence.
1022340	1026140	Yes, they were actually dumb enough to do that, at least according to this translated
1026140	1027180	Romanian article.
1027180	1030580	You know that in jail cells and visitation rooms, they listen to you, right?
1030580	1033460	You know that the Romanian government can translate what you say, right?
1033500	1035180	The Tate's are fucking retarded.
1035180	1036180	And this confirms it.
1036180	1040940	The world is full of Andrew Tate simps right now, filming the hashtag free top G and whatever.
1040940	1044580	And a lot of them are just sad, lonely dudes who are ignored by the mainstream progressive
1044580	1045580	apparatus.
1045580	1048820	The left had nothing to tell these people except that they were the source of all the
1048820	1049820	world's problems.
1049820	1053420	So I'm not surprised that they ran into the arms of the only person who actually offered
1053420	1056140	them an empowering perspective, despite the toxicity.
1056140	1058740	But you don't want to be Andrew Tate, man.
1058740	1061780	Even disregarding that he is probably going to pound you in the ass prison for the rest
1061780	1066700	of his life, the hedonistic lifestyle stops being fun for most people pretty quick.
1066700	1070340	Disposable women won't make you happy like a real relationship will.
1070340	1074420	Despite this, there's a bunch of rightoid influencers who are constantly running interference
1074420	1075420	for him.
1075420	1078980	Mike Cernovich, yeah, from the Gamergate days, was heavily involved in the war room.
1078980	1082700	Candace Owens and Paul Joseph Watson have both gone to bat for him, mainly because they're
1082700	1084340	all anti-woke and they know him personally.
1084340	1089400	I have to believe because of how public of a figure that Andrew Tate has been, because
1089400	1094600	of how honest he has been about his expectations and relationships and in his views of the
1094600	1098380	women that he is with or what he would do in a scenario if he was dating a girl that
1098380	1104000	did this or that, that the women that were messaging Andrew Tate, engaging in conversations
1104000	1110940	with Andrew Tate on the internet, on Instagram, via direct messaging, knew what they were
1110940	1112380	getting into.
1112380	1118420	And I feel that that is important to say because I am so sick of this idea by that we should
1118420	1121100	always accept that in every situation a woman is a victim.
1121100	1122600	I'm not empowered by that.
1122600	1124180	I don't find that to be empowering, right?
1124180	1128600	The Me Too movement to me disempowered women because it said, women never know what they're
1128600	1129600	doing.
1129600	1132220	They just are always little flowers and men take advantage.
1132220	1135160	The truth is that women take advantage too.
1135160	1140060	And the easiest thing for women to sell to get what they want is sex, right?
1140060	1141420	This is what tagless sponsor proves.
1141420	1142460	I want to be rich.
1142460	1146300	I want to have money and I don't want to work, so I'm going to sell sex.
1146300	1150520	I have no talent and I want to be an actress, so I'm going to sell sex.
1150520	1155220	With Paul Joseph Watson actually being one of the simps that watches some of Tate's girls.
1155220	1158140	This bitch next to you, she's not attractive, right?
1158140	1162740	I'm sure she's a nice girl, but she's not hot.
1162740	1163740	She's rubbish.
1163740	1169180	I mean, what can you get away with, like what is the most extreme physical act that you
1169180	1171180	can perform?
1171180	1185340	And there's no end to the video clips of Andrew Tate's American lawyer running interference
1185340	1187460	for him in the English-speaking media.
1187460	1190040	Or his manager saying, hey guys, everything's actually okay.
1190040	1191180	Of course you would say that.
1191180	1192340	You're his fucking manager.
1192340	1194740	You're getting paid to push the pro-Tate position.
1194740	1195740	That's your job.
1195740	1199620	In fact, in so far as Andrew Tate's manager is concerned, the funniest bit has to do with
1199620	1201140	the Vice expose.
1201140	1205260	Vice sent a reporter to Romania to hang out with Andrew Tate for a while, which he stupidly
1205260	1206260	agreed to.
1206260	1207260	Again, the Tates are stupid.
1207260	1210420	They had to know that this was an investigation into their actions by a media company.
1210420	1211420	That's what they're there for.
1211420	1212420	It's fucking Vice, dude.
1212420	1213420	We all know what they're about.
1213420	1216660	Well, the Tate's manager had this to say about it on a Twitter space.
1216660	1222340	What would you say is the biggest misrepresentation made in that Vice interview?
1222340	1223660	Okay, thanks for the question.
1223660	1227460	I'd say the biggest misrepresentation, first of all, is Matt himself.
1227820	1231180	When you interact with him, pretty regular guy, in front of the camera, he was always,
1231180	1234560	I'm timid, I'm a little bit scared, all these big bad guys around me.
1234560	1237840	When the camera's off, he's laughing, he's shaking hands, he's having a good time.
1237840	1240940	He himself was acting a certain role for the camera.
1240940	1245260	To me, that's the biggest lack of congruence.
1245260	1246420	The guy is lying.
1246420	1248980	He was having fun, he was smiling, he was laughing, he was joking.
1248980	1253700	Then when the camera went on and we noticed it, he goes into this timid, all these bad
1253700	1256140	men around me and they're doing violent things.
1256140	1258880	When the event comes out, it's just pure hit job.
1258880	1259880	These guys are evil.
1259880	1260880	It was a joke.
1260880	1264580	At the end of it, when he'd already got all the footage he wanted, he was still saying
1264580	1268140	positive things because the reality is it was a very positive event and he took part
1268140	1269140	in it.
1269140	1271500	He was welcomed into it and he benefited from it.
1271500	1273220	How naive is this fucking guy?
1273220	1274700	Yeah, he's there to do a job, dude.
1274700	1276200	He's there to ask the hard questions.
1276200	1280340	I know Vice definitely puts out some shit-ribbed reporting sometimes, but this is exactly what
1280340	1281700	a reporter should be doing.
1281700	1285240	The fact that he's nice to you personally does not mean that you've bought his undying
1285240	1286480	fucking loyalty.
1286480	1289920	Speaking of Vice, probably the biggest bit of copium I've heard comes from the Fresh
1289920	1291180	and Fit podcast.
1291180	1292180	Listen to this insanity.
1292180	1296840	Really, this whole situation, it's just so slimy.
1296840	1300760	What Vice is doing, they're really living up to that filthy media production company
1300760	1301760	that they own.
1301760	1302760	Oh, yeah.
1302760	1304920	And do you know it's 44% owned by George Soros?
1304920	1305920	Oh, shit.
1305920	1306920	Are you serious?
1306920	1307920	Yeah.
1307920	1308920	Damn.
1308920	1310480	The Soros Fund, 44% owner in Vice Media.
1310480	1311480	Holy fuck, dude.
1311480	1313000	Well, that explains a lot.
1313000	1314000	Yeah.
1314000	1317600	I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist or not, whatever the case may be, but I mean,
1317600	1318600	you know.
1318600	1319600	Yeah, there are no coincidences.
1319600	1320600	Coincidences, dude.
1320600	1326640	Yeah, because Vice is 44% owned by the George Soros Fund, they're clearly not capable of
1326640	1328560	reporting on Andrew Tate in a neutral way.
1328560	1330580	The Deep State, The Matrix, or whatever is coming for him.
1330580	1334880	George Soros is giving the orders himself, guys, except this numbskull doesn't know how
1334880	1336340	to fucking read.
1336340	1340400	Here's where he got that 44% number from, and I guess he just couldn't parse this list
1340400	1344000	because the 44% actually goes to TPG Capital.
1344000	1347260	Soros Fund management only owns 10%.
1347260	1351020	As a final Hail Mary, Andrew Tate decided to play the cancer card.
1351020	1354560	A few days ago, a bunch of his followers all dropped at once the claim that Andrew Tate
1354560	1358840	has lung cancer and that his lawyer is petitioning for a compassionate release so he could leave
1358840	1360320	Romania and get treatment.
1360320	1363520	Of course, the countries with the best cancer specialists, it turns out, are all countries
1363520	1365580	with no extradition treaties to Romania.
1365580	1369440	But a subsequent investigation has shown that although Andrew Tate does have a tumor, a
1369440	1373580	biopsy has confirmed that it is in fact benign, not cancerous.
1373580	1375200	So Andrew Tate is going to trial.
1375200	1378120	At the end of the day, the Tates prey on lonely men.
1378120	1379800	They don't help them, they exploit them.
1379800	1383280	They take their money through Hustler University and they take it through webcam donations.
1383280	1387040	There's a crowd of aimless young men out there and the progressives have entirely vilified
1387040	1388040	and abandoned.
1388040	1391560	And they've been driven right into the arms of somebody who is just as bad.
1391560	1400360	It's no surprise to me that we're starting to see scenes like this out there.
1400360	1402740	And that's not even mentioning how bad the Tates are to women.
1402740	1404520	These are not good dudes, guys.
1404520	1406280	They're not who you want to emulate.
1406280	1410080	They're not who you want to hold up as anti-woke heroes or some shit.
1410080	1413780	Rhytoids are stuck in this rut right now of simply accepting anything that is anti-left,
1413780	1416280	regardless of whether or not it's actually, you know, good.
1416280	1419280	And that has led to an alarming rise of people who are pro-Tate.
1419280	1423160	Hell, I know this doesn't mean much, since anybody can cite anything as a reason for
1423160	1424160	their madness.
1424160	1427760	But we've even got an Andrew Tate shooter now, at least an attempted shooter.
1427760	1432600	On January 5th, 2023, a 19-year-old Florida man, yes, Florida man, was arrested for threatening
1432600	1435000	a mass shooting at Florida State University.
1435000	1439440	He posted online a picture of his AR-15, as well as the address of the university, along
1439440	1444800	with the message, faggots will die, under the name BloodstainedSand0088.
1444800	1447720	He claimed the post was a joke, meant to get laughs in a Discord server.
1447720	1448720	And it might have been.
1449160	1452480	But he also has a previous record of violence and aggressive confrontation.
1452480	1457040	And yes, his Twitter account history showed him liking almost exclusively tons of Andrew
1457040	1458280	Tate content.
1458280	1461960	As I say with any other shooter that I talk about on this channel, the YouTuber or streamer
1461960	1466320	or whatever that a shooter watches is not really responsible for what the shooter does.
1466320	1470840	So I don't feel comfortable pinning this on Andrew Tate, but he's clearly not a good person.
1470840	1474280	I've felt that there was a significant values difference between myself and the people who
1474280	1478360	are actually on the right wing, such that I am not a right winger, and I never have
1478400	1479800	been, despite what leftists say.
1479800	1481560	And don't worry, I'm not a left winger either.
1481560	1485760	The unapologetic throwing that right wingers give to a scumbag like Andrew Tate all but
1485760	1487720	confirms that I'm not one of them.
1487720	1490640	Jokes aside, I will certainly never be a fucking communist.
1490640	1493680	But if this is what the right is nowadays, then I don't want any part of it.
