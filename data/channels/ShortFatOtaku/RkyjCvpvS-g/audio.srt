1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
Thank you very much everyone for the 100,000 subs, though this video is like two years late.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,200
I'm doing it now because I just received, finally, the silver play button. I've unboxed it on stream,

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,480
it's nice and shiny, though I did smudge it up a bit with my fat thumbs, and now I can return to

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,760
being a bit more edgy since I had to temporarily sanitize the channel in order to be eligible for

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,360
it. However, I'm reminded of Sargon's 100,000 back in the day, where he decided to take the

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,720
opportunity to shout out smaller channels, including mine by the way, that he thought

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,440
was worthy of your attention. So I'm going to do the same thing. I've got more channels to shout

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,520
out than he did back then, but I'm also going to include channels that aren't quite political.

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,480
So basically this is going to be a list of channels that I think you should watch that

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,040
are all under 100,000 subs. Now just to be clear, there are many YouTube channels over 100,000 subs

11
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,840
that I do watch, but they don't need a bump from me. Plus they're probably the same ones that you

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,360
watch anyway. So today I'm just going to be going over the ones who are a little bit smaller,

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,040
who would probably appreciate a little bit of a spotlight that I think you should be checking out,

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,640
with of course a special list of mentions at the end. So stay tuned for that too.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,480
All right, let's get going. And because I'm going alphabetically, the very first channel in the

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:24,320
list is Academic Agent. Now Academic Agent and I disagree on basically everything, but that's okay

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,920
because I like to hear other people's opinions on things. I like to hear other perspectives.

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,360
And if you basically want the neoreactionary view of politics, Academic Agent is the guy to go to.

19
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,960
He first hit my radar when President Sunday banded together with a bunch of leftoids and got him

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,880
fired and canceled from his job. I've been watching him on and off ever since.

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,600
Second up is Ace1918. He's been a viewer of mine for a while. He does a lot of cultural stuff,

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,000
but I think probably most importantly is that he's had a lot of trouble getting his channel

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,400
monetized. So maybe a boost of subs will help him up. So please consider following him.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,920
Next up is ActuallyTina. Now Tina is not a professional YouTuber in any sense of the word.

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
And basically all she does is she streams Final Fantasy stuff. I've had fun rating her a couple

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,240
times because she usually gets all flustered whenever I do. But where ActuallyTina is really

27
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,320
known is on Twitter. I first encountered her account during gamergate. She's nonpartisan

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,080
politically and her takes tend to be hilarious. So I don't know about her YouTube because it's

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,880
just Final Fantasy, but if you're on Twitter, definitely follow her.

30
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,360
And speaking of gamergate, the next channel I'm subbed to is Airplay. This is an upcoming

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,640
documentary about gamergate. If you're interested in the old lore and having the now decade old

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,680
story retold, this would definitely be a channel worth subbing to for when the documentary comes

33
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,880
out. This is Anastasia from Anastasia in Tech. Her thing is talking about microchips and AI.

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,360
She's very intelligent. She definitely knows her stuff. And if that topic's interesting to you,

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,720
she is the one to be following. Next up is AppaBend, a Filipino Shoda who really used to

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,800
make a lot more videos than he does. I think his channel would be blown up if he actually made

37
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,680
consistent content, but he seems to want to do things at his own pace. And hey, that's his

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,520
choice. He kind of reminds me of Third World It's a Gundam. So check him out. Next on my alphabetical

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,800
list is Big Nick. But Big Nick is mostly known for being Not-So-Arudite's boyfriend.

40
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,280
It's misogyny that he came first, guys. Nick often appears in Not-So-Arudite's content,

41
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,520
and frankly, Arudite is great. She's a fellow Canadian, so represent. But also she's very

42
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,480
educated in terms of psychology. You want to see some top tier psych takes, as well as debates and

43
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,960
memes and general shitposting. Hers is a pretty good channel to follow. I've talked to her a

44
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,600
couple times now. I'm happy to be acquaintances with her. And I would love to talk to her again

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,840
in the future. So let's hope it happens. We're in the bees now. Blaze the Hedgehog.

46
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,960
His channel is strictly not political. This is all about like Sega history. Because I'm a gamer,

47
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,240
I love that sort of thing. Borderline OCD. His whole thing is repairing old consoles,

48
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,160
like the hardware, placing parts or soldering things or whatever. This is actually also a

49
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,280
hobby of mine too. I've done a lot of console repairs, console mods in my off time. I follow

50
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,440
a lot of bigger channels that do this sort of thing. And they're all pretty good too. But his

51
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,840
is the only channel that I follow that engages in this hobby that is under 100k. There's just

52
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,320
something about tinkering around with old hardware, you know, opening up that old Super Nintendo or

53
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,200
whatever from your childhood, seeing how it worked. It's just so fun to me. Britannia is

54
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,000
a friend of Kraut, and I was introduced to her through him. She makes videos that are Kraut-like.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,880
She is a part of Kraut's attempt to make a libtube community on YouTube. It is not socialist,

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,680
but it's also not conservative. And though she makes content very infrequently, I do like the

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,880
videos that she puts out. CafeBeef and her boyfriend Kiln Firelink. She's a Pokemon YouTuber,

58
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,320
but like Tina, she's more known for her stuff on Twitter. And on Twitter, she is a fantastic,

59
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,400
hilarious schizo poster. Definitely worth following. Caleb Hart. Caleb Hart's on here?

60
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,240
Jesus, he only has 41,000 subs on YouTube. Caleb Hart is a huge Twitch streamer, dude. He's got

61
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,320
like, he gets like several thousand viewers on Twitch every single time he streams. He's one of

62
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,120
the most well-known speedrunners in the world. He does Final Fantasy VII speedruns. He does

63
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,760
Mega Man X speedruns. I find his stuff to be hilarious. I guess his YouTube channel just

64
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,440
doesn't get much traction. He's one of the OGs, though. He's been around for like 15 years,

65
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,000
and he's still great. Cherry is a Destiny orbiter. She definitely plays up her physical

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,120
attractiveness during her streams, but she doesn't do the TEEHEE Bimbo thing. She's actually pretty

67
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,800
intelligent, too. I've spoken with her a few times in private. She's always been a pretty chill

68
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,200
person, and though I don't have much time to watch streams anymore nowadays, when I do tune

69
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,320
into her show, I tend to have a pretty good time. Chaseface is a follower of mine. He actually

70
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,960
reminds me a lot of Silo Kayhawk, but I can't shout out Silo because he's more than 100,000 subs.

71
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,600
Chaseface is definitely cut from the same cloth, though. He does video game analysis and reviews,

72
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,440
a lot of it revolving around current video game culture. His stuff is not explicitly political,

73
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,120
but he is definitely not a leftist. Chatmort's vlogs are pretty good, but like other people on

74
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,920
this list, she is way more well-known for her Twitter posts. Another person that I met during

75
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:07,760
Gamergate? I've always enjoyed her takes. She's pretty funny. Ched Logic. I've enjoyed all my

76
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,120
private talks with Ched. He's a pretty good guy, it seems. I haven't known him for that long,

77
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,000
so I can't, you know, super vouch for him, but his content's hilarious. He's pretty good faith

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,960
whenever he engages with a subject. He triggers the fuck out of the leftoids just by basically

79
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,760
existing as somebody who was once a radical leftist and now no longer is. And whenever I do

80
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,240
tune into his stream, I'm always having a laugh. Classic Game Junkie is one in a series of small

81
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,520
channels that I sub to where they basically describe the underlying programming code of

82
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,520
various video games. He tends to focus on like early-ish 3D titles. You can see Crash Bandicoot

83
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,240
there, you can see Mario Galaxy, where he basically describes the programming code behind

84
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,000
some of early 3D gaming's most innovative sections. If that sort of thing is up your alley,

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,720
then he's worth checking out. Conversations with Curtis holds a special place in my heart.

86
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,880
It's hosted by Paul Morgan Stetler, who played Curtis from the FMV game from the 90s,

87
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,480
Phantasmagoria 2, a puzzle of flesh. And the entire project of his channel has been about

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:19,840
documenting old 90s FMV games, a period of gaming history that has basically fallen by the wayside,

89
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,360
and showing love for this oddity that existed between the transition from 2D gaming to 3D

90
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,560
gaming where everyone thought for a couple years that FMV games, movie games, were going to be the

91
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,360
next big thing. They were not, and the games are all over the place in terms of quality,

92
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,240
but even when they're bad they're good because of hilariously overacted scenes. So if you liked

93
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,760
Phantasmagoria back in the day, if you liked Ripper, if you liked any of these old FMV titles,

94
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,440
this is definitely a channel you want to watch. Corbis, otherwise known as Soph,

95
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,360
you all know who this person is. She is basically the right wing's Greta Thunberg,

96
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,040
a young girl who makes partisan content on the internet, though of course doesn't have nearly

97
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,120
the institutional backing that Greta Thunberg does, because she's on the right, not the left.

98
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,120
She tends to get banned from pretty much everywhere for being way too edgy, so I'm

99
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,680
surprised her YouTube channel's even still up, and the majority of her content is not even posted on

100
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,400
YouTube. Counterpoints is a Burkean conservative, he's been watching me long before I even knew who

101
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,080
he was. He reminds me of a 2017 era Sargon. He mainly talks about Warhammer 40k, but he does

102
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,960
dip his toes into the political side of YouTube and Twitch, where he is one of the only conservative

103
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,680
voices over there. I've been watching Danfan for a little while now. She explicitly keeps her

104
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,400
politics out of her videos, in fact if you ask her she will not tell you what her political alignment

105
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,640
is. Her focus is on comics, manga, anime, and even though she does take her digs at terrible woke

106
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,040
shows, she does it from the point of view of discussing their bad quality, and she kinda keeps

107
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,240
politics out of the conversation. It's quite refreshing. She has a niche, but she does what

108
00:08:50,240 --> 00:09:00,240
she does well. The Digital Blackface Podcast. This is a ridiculous and hilarious YouTube channel,

109
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,200
with some insane stuff. Funny, but definitely really far out there. And even though the content

110
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,600
on the channel is very good, this is one of those situations where the Twitter presence is bigger

111
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,400
than the YouTube channel. The fellow who runs it is Poe, another guy I met during gamergate.

112
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,480
A hilarious guy who has no problems talking about black culture and politics, being black himself,

113
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,160
and considering how funny he is on Twitter and his reasonably large amount of reach there,

114
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,800
his YouTube channel really should have more love. Demetri Monroe is a Sonic YouTuber,

115
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,080
and a very famous femboy. He is, like a lot of the entertainment type YouTubers that I watch,

116
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,360
politically unaligned but very anti-woke, and that comes through all the time in his video

117
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,120
essays. He tends to spend a lot of his time describing how leftoids, once they get into

118
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,760
positions of power in terms of translating anime or translating Japanese games, how they will

119
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,400
whitewash out what they consider to be problematic elements, and honestly make the anime or the manga

120
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,360
or the game in question a much shittier experience in English as a result. It's a topic that I'd love

121
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,640
to cover personally, but I just don't have time. Demetri does, so you should watch him.

122
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,040
Discordia is a friend of mine, I've always enjoyed talking to her. She works over at Sargon's Lotus

123
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,600
Eater's outfit, which basically leaves her with no time to post her own content, but it's always

124
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,240
been a pleasure seeing her on streams and bumping into her on on Kib's channel or whatever. I hope

125
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,400
we can do another tabletop campaign one day. Displaced Gamers is another channel talking

126
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,720
about the behind the scenes of video game code and how a lot of these mechanics work,

127
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,920
but unlike the previous one, this one deals with explicitly old games, so we're talking NES and

128
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,920
sometimes SNES games. Again, a niche topic, but very interesting to me. The DIY Doctor. Listen,

129
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,240
you're a fatherless millennial or zoomer, right? You never had a dad who would teach you how to,

130
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,120
you know, be a handyman, repair things around the house, that's okay. Go watch DIY Doctor.

131
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,560
Tells you all about how to do basic jobs and tools, you know, the normal stuff you got to

132
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,000
know to be an adult. Dylan Burns. I've spoken to Dylan a bunch of times. He is definitely a

133
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,080
progressive, much more further left than I am, but he's not a socialist. I tend not to agree

134
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,680
with his politics takes more than I agree with them. However, he is most well known for going

135
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,800
to Ukraine and becoming a war reporter. And you know what? Good for him, regardless of what you

136
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,040
think about him personally. It definitely takes stones to do this, to actually go into a war zone,

137
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,640
get footage and bring it out. He's going back soon, in fact, so I wish him the best. Now,

138
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,040
I know a lot of you guys don't like Econoboi and that's fine. I treat him like I treat a lot of the

139
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,920
other specialists that I've come into contact with over the course of doing YouTube. He's very

140
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,160
progressive and I tend not to agree with him politically, but when it comes to economics,

141
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,080
he certainly knows more than me. Definitely well educated in this field. And you can't simply

142
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,440
discard him by saying, ah, he's a lefty. I tend to find a lot of his stuff very educational.

143
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,920
Flamenco is absolutely hilarious. He is basically going to become the replacement Mr.

144
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,880
Medicker, Internet aristocrat. It seems like Medicker is not coming back due to his cancer.

145
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,600
Flamenco is cut from the exact same cloth. He has like a similar way of speaking,

146
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,200
a similar voice, even a similar sense of humor. He's just as autistic and he's just as hilarious.

147
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,880
Flamenco's streams and essays tend to be really, really funny. And you can tell that he is at

148
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,760
least somewhat effective because every time a breadtuber talks to him, they say that he is

149
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,880
an ultra fascist. He is as far right as you can go when really all he is is a troll.

150
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,960
Frozen Binary Studio was one of the first people that Scrump and I interviewed on Dumping with

151
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:39,600
Scrump. She was a big deal in the Dreamcast hacking scene until she got a job with Google.

152
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,560
And now, unfortunately, all the projects that I was interested that she was making

153
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,440
have all gone by the wayside. But she is slowly coming back to the internet again.

154
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,720
She got her Twitter account back, so I hope she gets back to it eventually.

155
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,480
Gammy is a small time politics streamer, bigger on Twitch than on YouTube.

156
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,120
She is kind of like a Conoboy in that she is clearly a progressive, and I don't agree with

157
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,840
her all the time, but also like a Conoboy, she is willing to speak out against the nonsense of the

158
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,320
socialist left. You can make deals and negotiate with welfare capitalist guys, but you can't do

159
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,000
that with socialists. Ghost Poli- Does Ghost still do his show? I guess he does. I used to watch

160
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,440
Ghost Politics like back in the day. Back when it was like Dark Razor Z and El Foxo Loco who were

161
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,680
posting clips of his shows where people would call in and troll him. I don't even remember still

162
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,880
being subbed to him. Ghost Politics is an experience. You gotta watch one of his shows

163
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,960
to really get it. Ghost is like half serious. He's half trolling. He's a right wing Texan

164
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,320
who's very pro capitalist, almost to the point of being an ANCAP in fact. He definitely does not

165
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,200
like the American government. However, a lot of his show is just devoted to trolling and having

166
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:52,240
callers call in and troll him. And that's honestly where the magic lies. Oh, Grumpy G-San. I'm still

167
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,640
subbed to him. This is an old man who used to wander around the Arizona desert and review anime

168
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:06,400
in the wilderness. He died 12 years ago. He was a big deal during the early internet. I kind of

169
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:14,320
forgot all about him. Haryan Gladev, or Gladiev, whatever. He is a libertarian who has really,

170
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,960
really, really wanted to talk to me. Probably about an opinion that I don't even hold anymore,

171
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:25,440
in fact. But that's okay. There are some really crazy dissident right people out there who you

172
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,800
should probably not give any consideration, but he is not one of them. He does not seem to be

173
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:38,160
somebody who has been completely brain rotted by conspiratorial thinking. Iron Liz is best known as

174
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,960
Linkara's former girlfriend. I've interviewed her a couple times. She's great. She's hilarious.

175
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:52,560
And right now she's working on turning Linkara's legendary comic, The Lightbringer, into an actual

176
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,240
comic. The first volume is already out and you should check it out. Tom Bahat is one of a

177
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,400
collection of guys that used to run with Medicare way back in the day, including Blackface Kermitt

178
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,640
and Latman Sun. I've talked to Latman some irregularly. He sometimes watched my content.

179
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,880
He's been on my show at least once. Haven't seen Blackface Kermitt in a very long time. And Tom

180
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,200
Bahat still makes his own content on his channel. These are people that I mainly just keep up with

181
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,320
from the old days. If you like Mega Man X, then JKB Games is somebody that you want to follow.

182
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,400
He is making a from scratch, completely new Mega Man X game called Mega Man X Corrupted.

183
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,800
It is in the style of the X one, two and three games from the Super Nintendo. And it is probably

184
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,080
one of the biggest fan projects that is nearing completion that I've ever seen. This is not one

185
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,200
of those pipe dream projects where after a few years the channel goes quiet. This guy has nearly

186
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,160
done it and it looks amazing. Justine Hoppt is an engineer who tinkers around with electronics and

187
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,600
makes her own devices. Most recently she made a rotary cell phone, which is absolutely hilarious.

188
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,080
And I'm sure every single hipster out there wants one. And yeah, it really works. She did all the

189
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,240
creation of the technology behind it. She did all the programming that goes into the tech,

190
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,960
all of it, hardware, software. She's very talented. And since I am a amateur tinkerer

191
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,840
myself, I've enjoyed seeing some of the things that she's done. Lady Decade reminds me of Larry

192
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:20,400
Bundy Jr, only just a female version. She does a lot of deep dives into obscure bits of old

193
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:27,280
video game history. We're talking beta versions of games or ROM hacks or like third world clones

194
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,200
and stuff. It's all stuff that's very interesting to me. Layman is a Canadian conservative YouTuber

195
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,360
who makes the occasional appearance on Twitch politics panels. He and his girlfriend Anna have

196
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,480
become decent acquaintances of mine over the past couple of years. I enjoy talking to them and I

197
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,360
hope that this channel takes off. LoftyPixels is I think most well known for being one of the

198
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,320
quartering's editors. And you can tell because he's made several viral clips. But they tend to

199
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,880
go viral on Twitter, not on YouTube. Nonetheless, video and audio editing, image editing, all stuff

200
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,480
he seems to know how to do. He's got a pretty snappy delivery in all of his jokes. And overall,

201
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,120
just a funny channel to watch. NotRub is basically a channel that archives all of Spoonie's lost

202
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,680
content. If you're a fan of the Spoonie one, Noah Antwiler, and you've noticed that his channel is

203
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,360
basically a desiccated husk with most of its content scrubbed off of it, NotRub has

204
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,640
archived as much as possible and uploaded it. This is like old reviews, old vlogs, stuff that

205
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,920
was exclusive to BlipTV and then was lost when BlipTV finally closed. He's got a lot of it here.

206
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,840
So if you ever wanted to go down memory lane and see when Spoonie was good, this is the channel

207
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,880
to go to. OhohoJohSama is a channel full of laughing anime girls. That's it. That's the

208
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,120
whole channel. I guess if you ever needed like a proper reaction video to post on Twitter or

209
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,920
something, you could come here and grab one. But that's all this channel is. I don't even know why

210
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,640
I'm subbed to it. Politics with Paint is another channel like Krauts and that it's a polnball

211
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,200
channel like Kraut and like Hoser and like a lot of these other politics channels. This is

212
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,680
all stuff that interests me personally because it has a focus on history and it uses polnballs.

213
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,080
You know what this is. You know if you like it, check it out. Rachel Richards is a viewer of mine

214
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,480
and is an anti-leftist trans woman. A lot of her content is vlogs about trans issues from a

215
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,440
non-leftist perspective, which by the way is kind of a refreshing perspective to see since the left

216
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,160
claims all trans people as their own. She hasn't done very much and she has one niche, but what

217
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,040
she does is done well. Ravignon is another person that I met through Kraut and he is probably one of

218
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,800
the only people that I've encountered that is both a socialist and actually somewhat honest.

219
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,600
It's a very rare thing. I've spoken with him privately a lot and we have some very rowdy

220
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,720
debates. He's helped me sharpen up a lot of my ideas especially ideas about the left and really

221
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,320
it's so rare to see an actual honest socialist who you know isn't evil that he's probably worth

222
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,160
following just for that alone. Raydude, this is a channel that is basically dead. It's fine though

223
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:03,760
because his claim to fame is that he made the legendary Newgrounds animation Link's Quest for

224
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,880
Ass back when I was in high school. And though his channel is mostly just talking about games

225
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,920
and doing some speedruns and stuff he also has a series of documentaries talking about the making

226
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,400
of that legendary animation which I found to be hilarious to watch. It was like I was back in high

227
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,320
school again. So much fun. If you remember the old days of Newgrounds you definitely want to check

228
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,680
this guy out. Riley Grace Rochon is another politics streamer who was cancelled and driven

229
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,440
off the internet by leftoids. She's been trying to become a professional lawyer I think for a

230
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,080
long time and the leftoids actually called I think her bar association to try to get her

231
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,000
career fucked up. Didn't work out but she's decided to take a break from the internet.

232
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,600
I hope she'll be back one day because she's very intelligent and this will be the channel that you

233
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,960
want to follow her on if she does ever return. Rose Mullet or is it Mulay I don't know. She's

234
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,960
another trans non-leftist who has been slowly making her name of herself in the online politics

235
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,000
space over on Twitch. It's honestly really refreshing to me to see trans perspectives

236
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
outside of leftist dogma. Also she does music too but I think most people are here for her politics.

237
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,560
And here's my friend Rose of Dawn. She used to do a lot of political content but she's since taken

238
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,320
a break from that. She is a non-leftist but she's also more explicitly pro right wing than a lot of

239
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,360
the other trans women we've talked about today. Which is by the way why Shinigami Eyes marks her

240
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,320
as red. But she has been a bit burnt out on politics recently so she's she's taken some

241
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,840
time off from that. Rosa Kotel is a vtuber, a snake vtuber that I follow and that I'm

242
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,440
kind of acquaintances with. And in fact I might as well just lump all the vtubers that I follow

243
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,800
in right now because I'm not much of a vtube person and there's tons of vtubers nowadays.

244
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,560
So I might as well just recommend to you the ones that I think are small and interesting. Rosa, Tomo,

245
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,880
bat at video games and vote for waifus. You know what vtubers are about? Cute anime avatars, cute

246
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,040
voices, playing video games. You all know why you're here. You're here to simp. You're here to

247
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,120
jack off. I get it. It's okay. These four are the ones that are the most interesting to me.

248
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:08,880
Shenmue fans! Pretty much is in the title isn't it? This is a channel for the Dreamcast sleeper

249
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,520
hit Shenmue. Has a cult following nowadays. If you like Shenmue you know what this is about. If you

250
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,520
don't, not for you. Side Scrollers is back! In fact they're they're live now while I'm recording

251
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,000
this. Side Scrollers was a podcast on screwattack.com headed up by Stuttering Craig.

252
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,880
Stuttering Craig has revived the side scroller's name for his new channel. Basically Stuttering

253
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,520
Craig built up ScrewAttack. He sold it to Rooster Teeth. He then went off on his own, restarted his

254
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,320
channel. He's doing his own thing and he's bringing side scrollers back. So good for him. If you like

255
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,320
the old side scrollers back in the day, I know my editor Dave does. He listened to that podcast a

256
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,880
lot on the bus going off to uh going off to college every day. If you liked it back then,

257
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,360
he's doing it again. Single Player Carl is another viewer of mine. He's another one of those guys

258
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,560
that met during gamergate. He's more prevalent on Twitter than he is on YouTube. But he is trying

259
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,840
to branch out into YouTube with some of his own content. As well as a program that he calls the

260
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,880
fried chicanery podcast. He's kind of like Poe in that he's a non-leftist black guy who talks about

261
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,760
black politics and culture. He's always really funny whenever I see him and he is worth a follow.

262
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,600
Sansol is one of those poor souls who used to be a breadtuber and has since broken out of their

263
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,720
orbit. Back when he was a breadtuber he uh he was actually quite hostile towards me. He has since

264
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,080
apologized for that. We've had a few conversations and he's definitely like uh my god I can't believe

265
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,640
how how dumb I was back in the day. He actually reminds me a lot of me when I was a communist.

266
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,160
Though I was younger than him when I was a communist. Whenever he describes a lot of his

267
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,720
time in the radical left he he frames it like that he knew deep down that none of this would

268
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,600
ever work. But he was kind of suppressing it because one he didn't like the current system

269
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,160
and two he wanted to keep all of his friends like Vosh and stuff. But then finally the contradictions

270
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,560
of the system became too great and he basically found himself at a crossroads where he could just

271
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,920
be a grifter and lie. Or he could you know pull the band-aid off start speaking the truth and it

272
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,680
would be costly for him and it was he lost all of his friends. Which is why his channel is much

273
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,360
smaller than it used to be. BreadTube absolutely hates him now in the same way that they hate

274
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,760
Chud Logic for for daring to leave them. Sophia Nowitz is just great. I first interviewed her

275
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,840
during um the George Floyd riots where she was doing on the ground reporting. Since she's local

276
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,960
to the area she went down there with her camera she was recording what was going on and she

277
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,000
described to me during that interview she had been kind of in a slump in her life and doing the on

278
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,280
the ground reporting invigorated her life again. And now she's like she she does do the twitch

279
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,360
streaming thing she does review games and she does like all the kind of game journo stuff

280
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,920
again from a non-hegemonic leftist perspective she's very much not part of the left. But when

281
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,320
there's an opportunity to do like real on the ground politics reporting she does that too.

282
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,520
I enjoy her streams, I enjoy her reviews, I enjoy her takes on twitter. She is the full package deal.

283
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,840
Stardust is cut from the same cloth as people like Chud Logic and Cherry and Flamenco and some

284
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,960
and Sansol. These are all people who are heavily engaged in the twitch politics sphere. They're not

285
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,000
socialists and they're really spicy. Though Stardust is a progressive she also has a very

286
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,560
good head on her shoulders. She's not afraid of admitting when she's wrong or when her political

287
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,440
side is fucked up some some way. She's not really a partisan she's not really ideologically bent and

288
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,800
she is one of the few people that I've met in the twitch politics space that I can honestly say has

289
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,400
a good faith conversation every single time. And she's also one of the only ones in that space

290
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,640
who's willing to talk to people outside of let's say the the leftist orthodoxy and she gets a lot

291
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,360
of shit for it. There's constantly conversations about is Stardust platforming people responsibly

292
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,680
and I've always told her she should just tell them to fuck off have the conversations you want to

293
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:53,360
have and I respect her for it so you should follow her. The Halfling formerly known as Paleo-Anglism

294
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,760
who was formerly known as British Knight. He's been watching me for years I've been on his

295
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,320
channel a couple times he's very close to being an AnCap and I do not agree with his politics at all

296
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,600
but unlike most radicals he's very polite and I can often have a good faith conversation with him.

297
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,800
Due to IRL stuff he has less time to make content than he used to but he is planning to come back

298
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:20,080
soon with something or other I guess we'll see. The Offensive Tranny is a female to male trans

299
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,160
person who is again presenting a non-leftist trans perspective on a lot of these trans topics.

300
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,880
He reminds me a lot of Blair White though obviously he's more masculine and Blair is more

301
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,160
feminine and Blair is also way more popular but he seems to be cut from the same cloth so if you

302
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,480
like that sort of thing you should check him out. Oh yeah the Snit Zone if you're Canadian you know

303
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:47,600
exactly what this is. YTV very famous Canadian television channel for children had a host for

304
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,840
the in-between cartoon segments that was a TV covered in purple goop whose name was Snit.

305
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,280
Probably one of the biggest things that any Canadian millennial remembers about the 90s

306
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,920
is Snit's antics and the fact that he's been revived and given his own YouTube channel is just

307
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,760
hilarious to me. The Britisher does primarily The Week That Was which is a pretty good replacement

308
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,040
for Sargon's This Week in Stupid. When I was banned a few years back he hosted one of my videos

309
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:19,040
My Weekly Sip until I got my channel back which is very kind of him. He is very much a classical

310
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,040
liberal type so if you're into Sargon's older stuff or if you're into me or V or somebody he's

311
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,920
definitely worth checking out. Then finally Warren Ray otherwise known as Bastiat. He is a

312
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:34,000
self-identified neoliberal he's probably the most high profile neoliberal in the twitch politics

313
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,840
sphere and he basically argues for normalcy. I have my problems with neolibs I'm sure we all do

314
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,160
but Bastiat's got a pretty good head on shoulders he knows what's going on. And there we are those

315
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,440
are all the channels that I'm subbed to that are under 100,000 subs and you guys should be checking

316
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,160
them all out. Of course this thank you for a hundred thousand subs video would not be complete

317
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:00,720
without actually thanking some people. There is of course my closest internet friends Sargon, Arch,

318
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,680
Vee, Kibz and Lilith. These five people have helped me immensely in more ways than I can count.

319
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,160
If you watch me you already know who they all are and I cannot thank them enough for everything.

320
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,520
There's also a number of other people who have given me a lot of help over the years too. The

321
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,080
efap guys rags mauler and fringy the tism guys baring dankula and the quartering adam friended

322
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,680
and psa sitch from the adam and sitch sunday show madri bread the let's player and pokemon challenge

323
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:33,920
youtuber taftaj a former sfo fangirl turned friend zaver somebody i've known for over a decade now

324
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,760
spooky minaris and denziel the borderlands crew see hoff manny otherwise known as harper one of

325
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,600
my most lasting friends that i met during gamergate though she's definitely not pro

326
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,480
gamergate anymore but that's fine singing reaper who has the unique distinction of being the only

327
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,840
red tube viewer i've ever met who is nonetheless not retarded there's kraut who i became friends

328
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,000
with while he was off the internet i realized that i was pretty much wrong about everything i

329
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,200
had said about him during the dumping with scrump days i apologized he forgave me and we became

330
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,120
pals and there's colink someone who is uh semi local to the area and who as long as we keep

331
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,840
growing here will be the first employee who is not one of my irl friends these are all people
