0	6560	Thank you very much everyone for the 100,000 subs, though this video is like two years late.
6560	13200	I'm doing it now because I just received, finally, the silver play button. I've unboxed it on stream,
13200	18480	it's nice and shiny, though I did smudge it up a bit with my fat thumbs, and now I can return to
18480	23760	being a bit more edgy since I had to temporarily sanitize the channel in order to be eligible for
23760	29360	it. However, I'm reminded of Sargon's 100,000 back in the day, where he decided to take the
29360	34720	opportunity to shout out smaller channels, including mine by the way, that he thought
34720	39440	was worthy of your attention. So I'm going to do the same thing. I've got more channels to shout
39440	45520	out than he did back then, but I'm also going to include channels that aren't quite political.
45520	50480	So basically this is going to be a list of channels that I think you should watch that
50480	57040	are all under 100,000 subs. Now just to be clear, there are many YouTube channels over 100,000 subs
57040	61840	that I do watch, but they don't need a bump from me. Plus they're probably the same ones that you
61840	65360	watch anyway. So today I'm just going to be going over the ones who are a little bit smaller,
65360	69040	who would probably appreciate a little bit of a spotlight that I think you should be checking out,
69040	72640	with of course a special list of mentions at the end. So stay tuned for that too.
72640	76480	All right, let's get going. And because I'm going alphabetically, the very first channel in the
76480	84320	list is Academic Agent. Now Academic Agent and I disagree on basically everything, but that's okay
84320	87920	because I like to hear other people's opinions on things. I like to hear other perspectives.
87920	93360	And if you basically want the neoreactionary view of politics, Academic Agent is the guy to go to.
93360	98960	He first hit my radar when President Sunday banded together with a bunch of leftoids and got him
98960	102880	fired and canceled from his job. I've been watching him on and off ever since.
103440	109600	Second up is Ace1918. He's been a viewer of mine for a while. He does a lot of cultural stuff,
109600	114000	but I think probably most importantly is that he's had a lot of trouble getting his channel
114000	118400	monetized. So maybe a boost of subs will help him up. So please consider following him.
118400	123920	Next up is ActuallyTina. Now Tina is not a professional YouTuber in any sense of the word.
123920	128000	And basically all she does is she streams Final Fantasy stuff. I've had fun rating her a couple
128000	132240	times because she usually gets all flustered whenever I do. But where ActuallyTina is really
132240	138320	known is on Twitter. I first encountered her account during gamergate. She's nonpartisan
138320	142080	politically and her takes tend to be hilarious. So I don't know about her YouTube because it's
142080	144880	just Final Fantasy, but if you're on Twitter, definitely follow her.
144880	149360	And speaking of gamergate, the next channel I'm subbed to is Airplay. This is an upcoming
149360	154640	documentary about gamergate. If you're interested in the old lore and having the now decade old
154640	159680	story retold, this would definitely be a channel worth subbing to for when the documentary comes
159680	164880	out. This is Anastasia from Anastasia in Tech. Her thing is talking about microchips and AI.
164880	169360	She's very intelligent. She definitely knows her stuff. And if that topic's interesting to you,
169360	174720	she is the one to be following. Next up is AppaBend, a Filipino Shoda who really used to
174720	178800	make a lot more videos than he does. I think his channel would be blown up if he actually made
178800	183680	consistent content, but he seems to want to do things at his own pace. And hey, that's his
183680	189520	choice. He kind of reminds me of Third World It's a Gundam. So check him out. Next on my alphabetical
189520	194800	list is Big Nick. But Big Nick is mostly known for being Not-So-Arudite's boyfriend.
194800	199280	It's misogyny that he came first, guys. Nick often appears in Not-So-Arudite's content,
199280	203520	and frankly, Arudite is great. She's a fellow Canadian, so represent. But also she's very
203520	208480	educated in terms of psychology. You want to see some top tier psych takes, as well as debates and
208480	212960	memes and general shitposting. Hers is a pretty good channel to follow. I've talked to her a
212960	217600	couple times now. I'm happy to be acquaintances with her. And I would love to talk to her again
217600	221840	in the future. So let's hope it happens. We're in the bees now. Blaze the Hedgehog.
221840	226960	His channel is strictly not political. This is all about like Sega history. Because I'm a gamer,
226960	232240	I love that sort of thing. Borderline OCD. His whole thing is repairing old consoles,
232240	236160	like the hardware, placing parts or soldering things or whatever. This is actually also a
236160	241280	hobby of mine too. I've done a lot of console repairs, console mods in my off time. I follow
241280	245440	a lot of bigger channels that do this sort of thing. And they're all pretty good too. But his
245440	249840	is the only channel that I follow that engages in this hobby that is under 100k. There's just
249840	254320	something about tinkering around with old hardware, you know, opening up that old Super Nintendo or
254320	259200	whatever from your childhood, seeing how it worked. It's just so fun to me. Britannia is
259200	264000	a friend of Kraut, and I was introduced to her through him. She makes videos that are Kraut-like.
264000	268880	She is a part of Kraut's attempt to make a libtube community on YouTube. It is not socialist,
268880	273680	but it's also not conservative. And though she makes content very infrequently, I do like the
273680	278880	videos that she puts out. CafeBeef and her boyfriend Kiln Firelink. She's a Pokemon YouTuber,
278880	284320	but like Tina, she's more known for her stuff on Twitter. And on Twitter, she is a fantastic,
284320	290400	hilarious schizo poster. Definitely worth following. Caleb Hart. Caleb Hart's on here?
290400	296240	Jesus, he only has 41,000 subs on YouTube. Caleb Hart is a huge Twitch streamer, dude. He's got
296240	300320	like, he gets like several thousand viewers on Twitch every single time he streams. He's one of
300320	305120	the most well-known speedrunners in the world. He does Final Fantasy VII speedruns. He does
305120	309760	Mega Man X speedruns. I find his stuff to be hilarious. I guess his YouTube channel just
309760	313440	doesn't get much traction. He's one of the OGs, though. He's been around for like 15 years,
313440	318000	and he's still great. Cherry is a Destiny orbiter. She definitely plays up her physical
318000	323120	attractiveness during her streams, but she doesn't do the TEEHEE Bimbo thing. She's actually pretty
323120	326800	intelligent, too. I've spoken with her a few times in private. She's always been a pretty chill
326800	331200	person, and though I don't have much time to watch streams anymore nowadays, when I do tune
331200	336320	into her show, I tend to have a pretty good time. Chaseface is a follower of mine. He actually
336320	340960	reminds me a lot of Silo Kayhawk, but I can't shout out Silo because he's more than 100,000 subs.
341520	345600	Chaseface is definitely cut from the same cloth, though. He does video game analysis and reviews,
345600	351440	a lot of it revolving around current video game culture. His stuff is not explicitly political,
351440	357120	but he is definitely not a leftist. Chatmort's vlogs are pretty good, but like other people on
357120	361920	this list, she is way more well-known for her Twitter posts. Another person that I met during
361920	367760	Gamergate? I've always enjoyed her takes. She's pretty funny. Ched Logic. I've enjoyed all my
367760	371120	private talks with Ched. He's a pretty good guy, it seems. I haven't known him for that long,
371120	376000	so I can't, you know, super vouch for him, but his content's hilarious. He's pretty good faith
376000	380960	whenever he engages with a subject. He triggers the fuck out of the leftoids just by basically
380960	387760	existing as somebody who was once a radical leftist and now no longer is. And whenever I do
387760	394240	tune into his stream, I'm always having a laugh. Classic Game Junkie is one in a series of small
394240	399520	channels that I sub to where they basically describe the underlying programming code of
399520	405520	various video games. He tends to focus on like early-ish 3D titles. You can see Crash Bandicoot
405520	410240	there, you can see Mario Galaxy, where he basically describes the programming code behind
410240	416000	some of early 3D gaming's most innovative sections. If that sort of thing is up your alley,
416000	420720	then he's worth checking out. Conversations with Curtis holds a special place in my heart.
420720	426880	It's hosted by Paul Morgan Stetler, who played Curtis from the FMV game from the 90s,
426880	432480	Phantasmagoria 2, a puzzle of flesh. And the entire project of his channel has been about
433200	439840	documenting old 90s FMV games, a period of gaming history that has basically fallen by the wayside,
439840	445360	and showing love for this oddity that existed between the transition from 2D gaming to 3D
445360	450560	gaming where everyone thought for a couple years that FMV games, movie games, were going to be the
450560	455360	next big thing. They were not, and the games are all over the place in terms of quality,
455360	460240	but even when they're bad they're good because of hilariously overacted scenes. So if you liked
460240	465760	Phantasmagoria back in the day, if you liked Ripper, if you liked any of these old FMV titles,
465760	469440	this is definitely a channel you want to watch. Corbis, otherwise known as Soph,
469440	473360	you all know who this person is. She is basically the right wing's Greta Thunberg,
473360	477040	a young girl who makes partisan content on the internet, though of course doesn't have nearly
477040	481120	the institutional backing that Greta Thunberg does, because she's on the right, not the left.
481120	485120	She tends to get banned from pretty much everywhere for being way too edgy, so I'm
485120	489680	surprised her YouTube channel's even still up, and the majority of her content is not even posted on
489680	494400	YouTube. Counterpoints is a Burkean conservative, he's been watching me long before I even knew who
494400	502080	he was. He reminds me of a 2017 era Sargon. He mainly talks about Warhammer 40k, but he does
502080	506960	dip his toes into the political side of YouTube and Twitch, where he is one of the only conservative
506960	511680	voices over there. I've been watching Danfan for a little while now. She explicitly keeps her
511680	516400	politics out of her videos, in fact if you ask her she will not tell you what her political alignment
516400	522640	is. Her focus is on comics, manga, anime, and even though she does take her digs at terrible woke
522640	527040	shows, she does it from the point of view of discussing their bad quality, and she kinda keeps
527040	530240	politics out of the conversation. It's quite refreshing. She has a niche, but she does what
530240	540240	she does well. The Digital Blackface Podcast. This is a ridiculous and hilarious YouTube channel,
540240	547200	with some insane stuff. Funny, but definitely really far out there. And even though the content
547200	551600	on the channel is very good, this is one of those situations where the Twitter presence is bigger
551600	556400	than the YouTube channel. The fellow who runs it is Poe, another guy I met during gamergate.
556400	562480	A hilarious guy who has no problems talking about black culture and politics, being black himself,
562480	568160	and considering how funny he is on Twitter and his reasonably large amount of reach there,
568160	572800	his YouTube channel really should have more love. Demetri Monroe is a Sonic YouTuber,
572800	578080	and a very famous femboy. He is, like a lot of the entertainment type YouTubers that I watch,
578080	583360	politically unaligned but very anti-woke, and that comes through all the time in his video
583360	587120	essays. He tends to spend a lot of his time describing how leftoids, once they get into
587120	591760	positions of power in terms of translating anime or translating Japanese games, how they will
591760	596400	whitewash out what they consider to be problematic elements, and honestly make the anime or the manga
596400	601360	or the game in question a much shittier experience in English as a result. It's a topic that I'd love
601360	604640	to cover personally, but I just don't have time. Demetri does, so you should watch him.
604640	609040	Discordia is a friend of mine, I've always enjoyed talking to her. She works over at Sargon's Lotus
609040	613600	Eater's outfit, which basically leaves her with no time to post her own content, but it's always
613600	618240	been a pleasure seeing her on streams and bumping into her on on Kib's channel or whatever. I hope
618240	622400	we can do another tabletop campaign one day. Displaced Gamers is another channel talking
622400	626720	about the behind the scenes of video game code and how a lot of these mechanics work,
626720	631920	but unlike the previous one, this one deals with explicitly old games, so we're talking NES and
631920	637920	sometimes SNES games. Again, a niche topic, but very interesting to me. The DIY Doctor. Listen,
637920	642240	you're a fatherless millennial or zoomer, right? You never had a dad who would teach you how to,
642240	647120	you know, be a handyman, repair things around the house, that's okay. Go watch DIY Doctor.
647120	650560	Tells you all about how to do basic jobs and tools, you know, the normal stuff you got to
650560	656000	know to be an adult. Dylan Burns. I've spoken to Dylan a bunch of times. He is definitely a
656000	662080	progressive, much more further left than I am, but he's not a socialist. I tend not to agree
662080	667680	with his politics takes more than I agree with them. However, he is most well known for going
667680	672800	to Ukraine and becoming a war reporter. And you know what? Good for him, regardless of what you
672800	679040	think about him personally. It definitely takes stones to do this, to actually go into a war zone,
679040	684640	get footage and bring it out. He's going back soon, in fact, so I wish him the best. Now,
684640	689040	I know a lot of you guys don't like Econoboi and that's fine. I treat him like I treat a lot of the
689040	693920	other specialists that I've come into contact with over the course of doing YouTube. He's very
693920	698160	progressive and I tend not to agree with him politically, but when it comes to economics,
698160	702080	he certainly knows more than me. Definitely well educated in this field. And you can't simply
702080	707440	discard him by saying, ah, he's a lefty. I tend to find a lot of his stuff very educational.
707440	713920	Flamenco is absolutely hilarious. He is basically going to become the replacement Mr.
713920	718880	Medicker, Internet aristocrat. It seems like Medicker is not coming back due to his cancer.
718880	723600	Flamenco is cut from the exact same cloth. He has like a similar way of speaking,
723600	729200	a similar voice, even a similar sense of humor. He's just as autistic and he's just as hilarious.
729200	734880	Flamenco's streams and essays tend to be really, really funny. And you can tell that he is at
734880	739760	least somewhat effective because every time a breadtuber talks to him, they say that he is
740480	746880	an ultra fascist. He is as far right as you can go when really all he is is a troll.
747440	752960	Frozen Binary Studio was one of the first people that Scrump and I interviewed on Dumping with
752960	759600	Scrump. She was a big deal in the Dreamcast hacking scene until she got a job with Google.
759600	762560	And now, unfortunately, all the projects that I was interested that she was making
763360	767440	have all gone by the wayside. But she is slowly coming back to the internet again.
767440	770720	She got her Twitter account back, so I hope she gets back to it eventually.
770720	774480	Gammy is a small time politics streamer, bigger on Twitch than on YouTube.
774480	779120	She is kind of like a Conoboy in that she is clearly a progressive, and I don't agree with
779120	783840	her all the time, but also like a Conoboy, she is willing to speak out against the nonsense of the
783840	788320	socialist left. You can make deals and negotiate with welfare capitalist guys, but you can't do
788320	794000	that with socialists. Ghost Poli- Does Ghost still do his show? I guess he does. I used to watch
794000	799440	Ghost Politics like back in the day. Back when it was like Dark Razor Z and El Foxo Loco who were
799440	803680	posting clips of his shows where people would call in and troll him. I don't even remember still
803680	808880	being subbed to him. Ghost Politics is an experience. You gotta watch one of his shows
808880	814960	to really get it. Ghost is like half serious. He's half trolling. He's a right wing Texan
814960	820320	who's very pro capitalist, almost to the point of being an ANCAP in fact. He definitely does not
820320	825200	like the American government. However, a lot of his show is just devoted to trolling and having
825200	832240	callers call in and troll him. And that's honestly where the magic lies. Oh, Grumpy G-San. I'm still
832240	838640	subbed to him. This is an old man who used to wander around the Arizona desert and review anime
838640	846400	in the wilderness. He died 12 years ago. He was a big deal during the early internet. I kind of
846720	854320	forgot all about him. Haryan Gladev, or Gladiev, whatever. He is a libertarian who has really,
854320	858960	really, really wanted to talk to me. Probably about an opinion that I don't even hold anymore,
858960	865440	in fact. But that's okay. There are some really crazy dissident right people out there who you
865440	870800	should probably not give any consideration, but he is not one of them. He does not seem to be
870800	878160	somebody who has been completely brain rotted by conspiratorial thinking. Iron Liz is best known as
878960	884960	Linkara's former girlfriend. I've interviewed her a couple times. She's great. She's hilarious.
884960	892560	And right now she's working on turning Linkara's legendary comic, The Lightbringer, into an actual
892560	896240	comic. The first volume is already out and you should check it out. Tom Bahat is one of a
896240	902400	collection of guys that used to run with Medicare way back in the day, including Blackface Kermitt
902400	906640	and Latman Sun. I've talked to Latman some irregularly. He sometimes watched my content.
906640	910880	He's been on my show at least once. Haven't seen Blackface Kermitt in a very long time. And Tom
910880	915200	Bahat still makes his own content on his channel. These are people that I mainly just keep up with
915200	922320	from the old days. If you like Mega Man X, then JKB Games is somebody that you want to follow.
922320	928400	He is making a from scratch, completely new Mega Man X game called Mega Man X Corrupted.
928400	934800	It is in the style of the X one, two and three games from the Super Nintendo. And it is probably
934800	940080	one of the biggest fan projects that is nearing completion that I've ever seen. This is not one
940080	945200	of those pipe dream projects where after a few years the channel goes quiet. This guy has nearly
945200	950160	done it and it looks amazing. Justine Hoppt is an engineer who tinkers around with electronics and
950160	955600	makes her own devices. Most recently she made a rotary cell phone, which is absolutely hilarious.
955600	960080	And I'm sure every single hipster out there wants one. And yeah, it really works. She did all the
960720	964240	creation of the technology behind it. She did all the programming that goes into the tech,
964240	968960	all of it, hardware, software. She's very talented. And since I am a amateur tinkerer
968960	973840	myself, I've enjoyed seeing some of the things that she's done. Lady Decade reminds me of Larry
973840	980400	Bundy Jr, only just a female version. She does a lot of deep dives into obscure bits of old
980400	987280	video game history. We're talking beta versions of games or ROM hacks or like third world clones
987280	993200	and stuff. It's all stuff that's very interesting to me. Layman is a Canadian conservative YouTuber
993200	997360	who makes the occasional appearance on Twitch politics panels. He and his girlfriend Anna have
997360	1002480	become decent acquaintances of mine over the past couple of years. I enjoy talking to them and I
1002480	1007360	hope that this channel takes off. LoftyPixels is I think most well known for being one of the
1007360	1012320	quartering's editors. And you can tell because he's made several viral clips. But they tend to
1012320	1016880	go viral on Twitter, not on YouTube. Nonetheless, video and audio editing, image editing, all stuff
1016880	1020480	he seems to know how to do. He's got a pretty snappy delivery in all of his jokes. And overall,
1020480	1027120	just a funny channel to watch. NotRub is basically a channel that archives all of Spoonie's lost
1027120	1031680	content. If you're a fan of the Spoonie one, Noah Antwiler, and you've noticed that his channel is
1031680	1037360	basically a desiccated husk with most of its content scrubbed off of it, NotRub has
1037360	1042640	archived as much as possible and uploaded it. This is like old reviews, old vlogs, stuff that
1042640	1047920	was exclusive to BlipTV and then was lost when BlipTV finally closed. He's got a lot of it here.
1047920	1051840	So if you ever wanted to go down memory lane and see when Spoonie was good, this is the channel
1051840	1058880	to go to. OhohoJohSama is a channel full of laughing anime girls. That's it. That's the
1058880	1065120	whole channel. I guess if you ever needed like a proper reaction video to post on Twitter or
1065120	1069920	something, you could come here and grab one. But that's all this channel is. I don't even know why
1069920	1074640	I'm subbed to it. Politics with Paint is another channel like Krauts and that it's a polnball
1074640	1079200	channel like Kraut and like Hoser and like a lot of these other politics channels. This is
1079200	1083680	all stuff that interests me personally because it has a focus on history and it uses polnballs.
1083680	1088080	You know what this is. You know if you like it, check it out. Rachel Richards is a viewer of mine
1088080	1094480	and is an anti-leftist trans woman. A lot of her content is vlogs about trans issues from a
1094480	1099440	non-leftist perspective, which by the way is kind of a refreshing perspective to see since the left
1099440	1104160	claims all trans people as their own. She hasn't done very much and she has one niche, but what
1104160	1109040	she does is done well. Ravignon is another person that I met through Kraut and he is probably one of
1109040	1114800	the only people that I've encountered that is both a socialist and actually somewhat honest.
1114800	1119600	It's a very rare thing. I've spoken with him privately a lot and we have some very rowdy
1119600	1124720	debates. He's helped me sharpen up a lot of my ideas especially ideas about the left and really
1124720	1130320	it's so rare to see an actual honest socialist who you know isn't evil that he's probably worth
1130320	1136160	following just for that alone. Raydude, this is a channel that is basically dead. It's fine though
1136160	1143760	because his claim to fame is that he made the legendary Newgrounds animation Link's Quest for
1143760	1148880	Ass back when I was in high school. And though his channel is mostly just talking about games
1148880	1153920	and doing some speedruns and stuff he also has a series of documentaries talking about the making
1153920	1158400	of that legendary animation which I found to be hilarious to watch. It was like I was back in high
1158400	1162320	school again. So much fun. If you remember the old days of Newgrounds you definitely want to check
1162320	1167680	this guy out. Riley Grace Rochon is another politics streamer who was cancelled and driven
1167680	1171440	off the internet by leftoids. She's been trying to become a professional lawyer I think for a
1171440	1176080	long time and the leftoids actually called I think her bar association to try to get her
1176080	1180000	career fucked up. Didn't work out but she's decided to take a break from the internet.
1180000	1183600	I hope she'll be back one day because she's very intelligent and this will be the channel that you
1183600	1188960	want to follow her on if she does ever return. Rose Mullet or is it Mulay I don't know. She's
1188960	1194960	another trans non-leftist who has been slowly making her name of herself in the online politics
1194960	1200000	space over on Twitch. It's honestly really refreshing to me to see trans perspectives
1200000	1206000	outside of leftist dogma. Also she does music too but I think most people are here for her politics.
1206000	1210560	And here's my friend Rose of Dawn. She used to do a lot of political content but she's since taken
1210560	1216320	a break from that. She is a non-leftist but she's also more explicitly pro right wing than a lot of
1216320	1221360	the other trans women we've talked about today. Which is by the way why Shinigami Eyes marks her
1221360	1226320	as red. But she has been a bit burnt out on politics recently so she's she's taken some
1226320	1231840	time off from that. Rosa Kotel is a vtuber, a snake vtuber that I follow and that I'm
1231840	1235440	kind of acquaintances with. And in fact I might as well just lump all the vtubers that I follow
1235440	1240800	in right now because I'm not much of a vtube person and there's tons of vtubers nowadays.
1240800	1246560	So I might as well just recommend to you the ones that I think are small and interesting. Rosa, Tomo,
1246560	1252880	bat at video games and vote for waifus. You know what vtubers are about? Cute anime avatars, cute
1252880	1257040	voices, playing video games. You all know why you're here. You're here to simp. You're here to
1257040	1261120	jack off. I get it. It's okay. These four are the ones that are the most interesting to me.
1261120	1268880	Shenmue fans! Pretty much is in the title isn't it? This is a channel for the Dreamcast sleeper
1268880	1273520	hit Shenmue. Has a cult following nowadays. If you like Shenmue you know what this is about. If you
1273520	1279520	don't, not for you. Side Scrollers is back! In fact they're they're live now while I'm recording
1279520	1284000	this. Side Scrollers was a podcast on screwattack.com headed up by Stuttering Craig.
1284000	1288880	Stuttering Craig has revived the side scroller's name for his new channel. Basically Stuttering
1288880	1293520	Craig built up ScrewAttack. He sold it to Rooster Teeth. He then went off on his own, restarted his
1293520	1298320	channel. He's doing his own thing and he's bringing side scrollers back. So good for him. If you like
1298320	1302320	the old side scrollers back in the day, I know my editor Dave does. He listened to that podcast a
1302320	1306880	lot on the bus going off to uh going off to college every day. If you liked it back then,
1306880	1311360	he's doing it again. Single Player Carl is another viewer of mine. He's another one of those guys
1311360	1316560	that met during gamergate. He's more prevalent on Twitter than he is on YouTube. But he is trying
1316560	1321840	to branch out into YouTube with some of his own content. As well as a program that he calls the
1321840	1328880	fried chicanery podcast. He's kind of like Poe in that he's a non-leftist black guy who talks about
1328880	1333760	black politics and culture. He's always really funny whenever I see him and he is worth a follow.
1333760	1339600	Sansol is one of those poor souls who used to be a breadtuber and has since broken out of their
1339600	1344720	orbit. Back when he was a breadtuber he uh he was actually quite hostile towards me. He has since
1344720	1350080	apologized for that. We've had a few conversations and he's definitely like uh my god I can't believe
1350080	1356640	how how dumb I was back in the day. He actually reminds me a lot of me when I was a communist.
1356640	1360160	Though I was younger than him when I was a communist. Whenever he describes a lot of his
1360480	1366720	time in the radical left he he frames it like that he knew deep down that none of this would
1366720	1371600	ever work. But he was kind of suppressing it because one he didn't like the current system
1371600	1376160	and two he wanted to keep all of his friends like Vosh and stuff. But then finally the contradictions
1376160	1380560	of the system became too great and he basically found himself at a crossroads where he could just
1380560	1385920	be a grifter and lie. Or he could you know pull the band-aid off start speaking the truth and it
1385920	1389680	would be costly for him and it was he lost all of his friends. Which is why his channel is much
1389760	1393360	smaller than it used to be. BreadTube absolutely hates him now in the same way that they hate
1393360	1397760	Chud Logic for for daring to leave them. Sophia Nowitz is just great. I first interviewed her
1397760	1403840	during um the George Floyd riots where she was doing on the ground reporting. Since she's local
1403840	1406960	to the area she went down there with her camera she was recording what was going on and she
1406960	1412000	described to me during that interview she had been kind of in a slump in her life and doing the on
1412000	1417280	the ground reporting invigorated her life again. And now she's like she she does do the twitch
1417280	1421360	streaming thing she does review games and she does like all the kind of game journo stuff
1421360	1425920	again from a non-hegemonic leftist perspective she's very much not part of the left. But when
1425920	1430320	there's an opportunity to do like real on the ground politics reporting she does that too.
1430320	1435520	I enjoy her streams, I enjoy her reviews, I enjoy her takes on twitter. She is the full package deal.
1435520	1441840	Stardust is cut from the same cloth as people like Chud Logic and Cherry and Flamenco and some
1441840	1446960	and Sansol. These are all people who are heavily engaged in the twitch politics sphere. They're not
1447040	1452000	socialists and they're really spicy. Though Stardust is a progressive she also has a very
1452000	1456560	good head on her shoulders. She's not afraid of admitting when she's wrong or when her political
1456560	1461440	side is fucked up some some way. She's not really a partisan she's not really ideologically bent and
1461440	1466800	she is one of the few people that I've met in the twitch politics space that I can honestly say has
1466800	1472400	a good faith conversation every single time. And she's also one of the only ones in that space
1472400	1478640	who's willing to talk to people outside of let's say the the leftist orthodoxy and she gets a lot
1478640	1483360	of shit for it. There's constantly conversations about is Stardust platforming people responsibly
1483360	1487680	and I've always told her she should just tell them to fuck off have the conversations you want to
1487680	1493360	have and I respect her for it so you should follow her. The Halfling formerly known as Paleo-Anglism
1493360	1497760	who was formerly known as British Knight. He's been watching me for years I've been on his
1497760	1502320	channel a couple times he's very close to being an AnCap and I do not agree with his politics at all
1502560	1507600	but unlike most radicals he's very polite and I can often have a good faith conversation with him.
1507600	1512800	Due to IRL stuff he has less time to make content than he used to but he is planning to come back
1512800	1520080	soon with something or other I guess we'll see. The Offensive Tranny is a female to male trans
1520080	1526160	person who is again presenting a non-leftist trans perspective on a lot of these trans topics.
1526160	1530880	He reminds me a lot of Blair White though obviously he's more masculine and Blair is more
1530880	1536160	feminine and Blair is also way more popular but he seems to be cut from the same cloth so if you
1536160	1540480	like that sort of thing you should check him out. Oh yeah the Snit Zone if you're Canadian you know
1540480	1547600	exactly what this is. YTV very famous Canadian television channel for children had a host for
1547600	1553840	the in-between cartoon segments that was a TV covered in purple goop whose name was Snit.
1553840	1557280	Probably one of the biggest things that any Canadian millennial remembers about the 90s
1557280	1561920	is Snit's antics and the fact that he's been revived and given his own YouTube channel is just
1561920	1567760	hilarious to me. The Britisher does primarily The Week That Was which is a pretty good replacement
1567760	1573040	for Sargon's This Week in Stupid. When I was banned a few years back he hosted one of my videos
1573040	1579040	My Weekly Sip until I got my channel back which is very kind of him. He is very much a classical
1579040	1583040	liberal type so if you're into Sargon's older stuff or if you're into me or V or somebody he's
1583040	1587920	definitely worth checking out. Then finally Warren Ray otherwise known as Bastiat. He is a
1587920	1594000	self-identified neoliberal he's probably the most high profile neoliberal in the twitch politics
1594000	1599840	sphere and he basically argues for normalcy. I have my problems with neolibs I'm sure we all do
1599840	1604160	but Bastiat's got a pretty good head on shoulders he knows what's going on. And there we are those
1604160	1609440	are all the channels that I'm subbed to that are under 100,000 subs and you guys should be checking
1609440	1614160	them all out. Of course this thank you for a hundred thousand subs video would not be complete
1614160	1620720	without actually thanking some people. There is of course my closest internet friends Sargon, Arch,
1620720	1627680	Vee, Kibz and Lilith. These five people have helped me immensely in more ways than I can count.
1627680	1632160	If you watch me you already know who they all are and I cannot thank them enough for everything.
1632160	1635520	There's also a number of other people who have given me a lot of help over the years too. The
1635520	1642080	efap guys rags mauler and fringy the tism guys baring dankula and the quartering adam friended
1642080	1647680	and psa sitch from the adam and sitch sunday show madri bread the let's player and pokemon challenge
1647680	1653920	youtuber taftaj a former sfo fangirl turned friend zaver somebody i've known for over a decade now
1653920	1659760	spooky minaris and denziel the borderlands crew see hoff manny otherwise known as harper one of
1659760	1663600	my most lasting friends that i met during gamergate though she's definitely not pro
1663600	1668480	gamergate anymore but that's fine singing reaper who has the unique distinction of being the only
1668480	1673840	red tube viewer i've ever met who is nonetheless not retarded there's kraut who i became friends
1673840	1678000	with while he was off the internet i realized that i was pretty much wrong about everything i
1678000	1683200	had said about him during the dumping with scrump days i apologized he forgave me and we became
1683200	1689120	pals and there's colink someone who is uh semi local to the area and who as long as we keep
1689120	1693840	growing here will be the first employee who is not one of my irl friends these are all people
1693840	1697360	who have helped me out over the years and i appreciate all of them there is of course a
1697360	1702800	special thank for all of my moderators both past and present as well as the people who both work
1702800	1708960	and i guess unofficially intern here at the channel my lifelong friend dave my girlfriend
1708960	1713840	naomi and dave's girlfriend dom don't worry there'll be more money soon i hope as long as
1713840	1718240	you keep growing thanks very much to everyone who's helped me out over the years and of course
1718240	1722320	thanks to you for watching i wouldn't have come this far without you i'm not going to cry like
1722320	1727200	mundane matt did over his uh his silver play button and i'm under no illusions that i'm
1727200	1730960	ever going to get to a million within my lifetime or otherwise but hey who knows it might happen
