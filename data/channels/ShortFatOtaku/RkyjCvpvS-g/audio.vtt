WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
Thank you very much everyone for the 100,000 subs, though this video is like two years late.

00:06.560 --> 00:13.200
I'm doing it now because I just received, finally, the silver play button. I've unboxed it on stream,

00:13.200 --> 00:18.480
it's nice and shiny, though I did smudge it up a bit with my fat thumbs, and now I can return to

00:18.480 --> 00:23.760
being a bit more edgy since I had to temporarily sanitize the channel in order to be eligible for

00:23.760 --> 00:29.360
it. However, I'm reminded of Sargon's 100,000 back in the day, where he decided to take the

00:29.360 --> 00:34.720
opportunity to shout out smaller channels, including mine by the way, that he thought

00:34.720 --> 00:39.440
was worthy of your attention. So I'm going to do the same thing. I've got more channels to shout

00:39.440 --> 00:45.520
out than he did back then, but I'm also going to include channels that aren't quite political.

00:45.520 --> 00:50.480
So basically this is going to be a list of channels that I think you should watch that

00:50.480 --> 00:57.040
are all under 100,000 subs. Now just to be clear, there are many YouTube channels over 100,000 subs

00:57.040 --> 01:01.840
that I do watch, but they don't need a bump from me. Plus they're probably the same ones that you

01:01.840 --> 01:05.360
watch anyway. So today I'm just going to be going over the ones who are a little bit smaller,

01:05.360 --> 01:09.040
who would probably appreciate a little bit of a spotlight that I think you should be checking out,

01:09.040 --> 01:12.640
with of course a special list of mentions at the end. So stay tuned for that too.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.480
All right, let's get going. And because I'm going alphabetically, the very first channel in the

01:16.480 --> 01:24.320
list is Academic Agent. Now Academic Agent and I disagree on basically everything, but that's okay

01:24.320 --> 01:27.920
because I like to hear other people's opinions on things. I like to hear other perspectives.

01:27.920 --> 01:33.360
And if you basically want the neoreactionary view of politics, Academic Agent is the guy to go to.

01:33.360 --> 01:38.960
He first hit my radar when President Sunday banded together with a bunch of leftoids and got him

01:38.960 --> 01:42.880
fired and canceled from his job. I've been watching him on and off ever since.

01:43.440 --> 01:49.600
Second up is Ace1918. He's been a viewer of mine for a while. He does a lot of cultural stuff,

01:49.600 --> 01:54.000
but I think probably most importantly is that he's had a lot of trouble getting his channel

01:54.000 --> 01:58.400
monetized. So maybe a boost of subs will help him up. So please consider following him.

01:58.400 --> 02:03.920
Next up is ActuallyTina. Now Tina is not a professional YouTuber in any sense of the word.

02:03.920 --> 02:08.000
And basically all she does is she streams Final Fantasy stuff. I've had fun rating her a couple

02:08.000 --> 02:12.240
times because she usually gets all flustered whenever I do. But where ActuallyTina is really

02:12.240 --> 02:18.320
known is on Twitter. I first encountered her account during gamergate. She's nonpartisan

02:18.320 --> 02:22.080
politically and her takes tend to be hilarious. So I don't know about her YouTube because it's

02:22.080 --> 02:24.880
just Final Fantasy, but if you're on Twitter, definitely follow her.

02:24.880 --> 02:29.360
And speaking of gamergate, the next channel I'm subbed to is Airplay. This is an upcoming

02:29.360 --> 02:34.640
documentary about gamergate. If you're interested in the old lore and having the now decade old

02:34.640 --> 02:39.680
story retold, this would definitely be a channel worth subbing to for when the documentary comes

02:39.680 --> 02:44.880
out. This is Anastasia from Anastasia in Tech. Her thing is talking about microchips and AI.

02:44.880 --> 02:49.360
She's very intelligent. She definitely knows her stuff. And if that topic's interesting to you,

02:49.360 --> 02:54.720
she is the one to be following. Next up is AppaBend, a Filipino Shoda who really used to

02:54.720 --> 02:58.800
make a lot more videos than he does. I think his channel would be blown up if he actually made

02:58.800 --> 03:03.680
consistent content, but he seems to want to do things at his own pace. And hey, that's his

03:03.680 --> 03:09.520
choice. He kind of reminds me of Third World It's a Gundam. So check him out. Next on my alphabetical

03:09.520 --> 03:14.800
list is Big Nick. But Big Nick is mostly known for being Not-So-Arudite's boyfriend.

03:14.800 --> 03:19.280
It's misogyny that he came first, guys. Nick often appears in Not-So-Arudite's content,

03:19.280 --> 03:23.520
and frankly, Arudite is great. She's a fellow Canadian, so represent. But also she's very

03:23.520 --> 03:28.480
educated in terms of psychology. You want to see some top tier psych takes, as well as debates and

03:28.480 --> 03:32.960
memes and general shitposting. Hers is a pretty good channel to follow. I've talked to her a

03:32.960 --> 03:37.600
couple times now. I'm happy to be acquaintances with her. And I would love to talk to her again

03:37.600 --> 03:41.840
in the future. So let's hope it happens. We're in the bees now. Blaze the Hedgehog.

03:41.840 --> 03:46.960
His channel is strictly not political. This is all about like Sega history. Because I'm a gamer,

03:46.960 --> 03:52.240
I love that sort of thing. Borderline OCD. His whole thing is repairing old consoles,

03:52.240 --> 03:56.160
like the hardware, placing parts or soldering things or whatever. This is actually also a

03:56.160 --> 04:01.280
hobby of mine too. I've done a lot of console repairs, console mods in my off time. I follow

04:01.280 --> 04:05.440
a lot of bigger channels that do this sort of thing. And they're all pretty good too. But his

04:05.440 --> 04:09.840
is the only channel that I follow that engages in this hobby that is under 100k. There's just

04:09.840 --> 04:14.320
something about tinkering around with old hardware, you know, opening up that old Super Nintendo or

04:14.320 --> 04:19.200
whatever from your childhood, seeing how it worked. It's just so fun to me. Britannia is

04:19.200 --> 04:24.000
a friend of Kraut, and I was introduced to her through him. She makes videos that are Kraut-like.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.880
She is a part of Kraut's attempt to make a libtube community on YouTube. It is not socialist,

04:28.880 --> 04:33.680
but it's also not conservative. And though she makes content very infrequently, I do like the

04:33.680 --> 04:38.880
videos that she puts out. CafeBeef and her boyfriend Kiln Firelink. She's a Pokemon YouTuber,

04:38.880 --> 04:44.320
but like Tina, she's more known for her stuff on Twitter. And on Twitter, she is a fantastic,

04:44.320 --> 04:50.400
hilarious schizo poster. Definitely worth following. Caleb Hart. Caleb Hart's on here?

04:50.400 --> 04:56.240
Jesus, he only has 41,000 subs on YouTube. Caleb Hart is a huge Twitch streamer, dude. He's got

04:56.240 --> 05:00.320
like, he gets like several thousand viewers on Twitch every single time he streams. He's one of

05:00.320 --> 05:05.120
the most well-known speedrunners in the world. He does Final Fantasy VII speedruns. He does

05:05.120 --> 05:09.760
Mega Man X speedruns. I find his stuff to be hilarious. I guess his YouTube channel just

05:09.760 --> 05:13.440
doesn't get much traction. He's one of the OGs, though. He's been around for like 15 years,

05:13.440 --> 05:18.000
and he's still great. Cherry is a Destiny orbiter. She definitely plays up her physical

05:18.000 --> 05:23.120
attractiveness during her streams, but she doesn't do the TEEHEE Bimbo thing. She's actually pretty

05:23.120 --> 05:26.800
intelligent, too. I've spoken with her a few times in private. She's always been a pretty chill

05:26.800 --> 05:31.200
person, and though I don't have much time to watch streams anymore nowadays, when I do tune

05:31.200 --> 05:36.320
into her show, I tend to have a pretty good time. Chaseface is a follower of mine. He actually

05:36.320 --> 05:40.960
reminds me a lot of Silo Kayhawk, but I can't shout out Silo because he's more than 100,000 subs.

05:41.520 --> 05:45.600
Chaseface is definitely cut from the same cloth, though. He does video game analysis and reviews,

05:45.600 --> 05:51.440
a lot of it revolving around current video game culture. His stuff is not explicitly political,

05:51.440 --> 05:57.120
but he is definitely not a leftist. Chatmort's vlogs are pretty good, but like other people on

05:57.120 --> 06:01.920
this list, she is way more well-known for her Twitter posts. Another person that I met during

06:01.920 --> 06:07.760
Gamergate? I've always enjoyed her takes. She's pretty funny. Ched Logic. I've enjoyed all my

06:07.760 --> 06:11.120
private talks with Ched. He's a pretty good guy, it seems. I haven't known him for that long,

06:11.120 --> 06:16.000
so I can't, you know, super vouch for him, but his content's hilarious. He's pretty good faith

06:16.000 --> 06:20.960
whenever he engages with a subject. He triggers the fuck out of the leftoids just by basically

06:20.960 --> 06:27.760
existing as somebody who was once a radical leftist and now no longer is. And whenever I do

06:27.760 --> 06:34.240
tune into his stream, I'm always having a laugh. Classic Game Junkie is one in a series of small

06:34.240 --> 06:39.520
channels that I sub to where they basically describe the underlying programming code of

06:39.520 --> 06:45.520
various video games. He tends to focus on like early-ish 3D titles. You can see Crash Bandicoot

06:45.520 --> 06:50.240
there, you can see Mario Galaxy, where he basically describes the programming code behind

06:50.240 --> 06:56.000
some of early 3D gaming's most innovative sections. If that sort of thing is up your alley,

06:56.000 --> 07:00.720
then he's worth checking out. Conversations with Curtis holds a special place in my heart.

07:00.720 --> 07:06.880
It's hosted by Paul Morgan Stetler, who played Curtis from the FMV game from the 90s,

07:06.880 --> 07:12.480
Phantasmagoria 2, a puzzle of flesh. And the entire project of his channel has been about

07:13.200 --> 07:19.840
documenting old 90s FMV games, a period of gaming history that has basically fallen by the wayside,

07:19.840 --> 07:25.360
and showing love for this oddity that existed between the transition from 2D gaming to 3D

07:25.360 --> 07:30.560
gaming where everyone thought for a couple years that FMV games, movie games, were going to be the

07:30.560 --> 07:35.360
next big thing. They were not, and the games are all over the place in terms of quality,

07:35.360 --> 07:40.240
but even when they're bad they're good because of hilariously overacted scenes. So if you liked

07:40.240 --> 07:45.760
Phantasmagoria back in the day, if you liked Ripper, if you liked any of these old FMV titles,

07:45.760 --> 07:49.440
this is definitely a channel you want to watch. Corbis, otherwise known as Soph,

07:49.440 --> 07:53.360
you all know who this person is. She is basically the right wing's Greta Thunberg,

07:53.360 --> 07:57.040
a young girl who makes partisan content on the internet, though of course doesn't have nearly

07:57.040 --> 08:01.120
the institutional backing that Greta Thunberg does, because she's on the right, not the left.

08:01.120 --> 08:05.120
She tends to get banned from pretty much everywhere for being way too edgy, so I'm

08:05.120 --> 08:09.680
surprised her YouTube channel's even still up, and the majority of her content is not even posted on

08:09.680 --> 08:14.400
YouTube. Counterpoints is a Burkean conservative, he's been watching me long before I even knew who

08:14.400 --> 08:22.080
he was. He reminds me of a 2017 era Sargon. He mainly talks about Warhammer 40k, but he does

08:22.080 --> 08:26.960
dip his toes into the political side of YouTube and Twitch, where he is one of the only conservative

08:26.960 --> 08:31.680
voices over there. I've been watching Danfan for a little while now. She explicitly keeps her

08:31.680 --> 08:36.400
politics out of her videos, in fact if you ask her she will not tell you what her political alignment

08:36.400 --> 08:42.640
is. Her focus is on comics, manga, anime, and even though she does take her digs at terrible woke

08:42.640 --> 08:47.040
shows, she does it from the point of view of discussing their bad quality, and she kinda keeps

08:47.040 --> 08:50.240
politics out of the conversation. It's quite refreshing. She has a niche, but she does what

08:50.240 --> 09:00.240
she does well. The Digital Blackface Podcast. This is a ridiculous and hilarious YouTube channel,

09:00.240 --> 09:07.200
with some insane stuff. Funny, but definitely really far out there. And even though the content

09:07.200 --> 09:11.600
on the channel is very good, this is one of those situations where the Twitter presence is bigger

09:11.600 --> 09:16.400
than the YouTube channel. The fellow who runs it is Poe, another guy I met during gamergate.

09:16.400 --> 09:22.480
A hilarious guy who has no problems talking about black culture and politics, being black himself,

09:22.480 --> 09:28.160
and considering how funny he is on Twitter and his reasonably large amount of reach there,

09:28.160 --> 09:32.800
his YouTube channel really should have more love. Demetri Monroe is a Sonic YouTuber,

09:32.800 --> 09:38.080
and a very famous femboy. He is, like a lot of the entertainment type YouTubers that I watch,

09:38.080 --> 09:43.360
politically unaligned but very anti-woke, and that comes through all the time in his video

09:43.360 --> 09:47.120
essays. He tends to spend a lot of his time describing how leftoids, once they get into

09:47.120 --> 09:51.760
positions of power in terms of translating anime or translating Japanese games, how they will

09:51.760 --> 09:56.400
whitewash out what they consider to be problematic elements, and honestly make the anime or the manga

09:56.400 --> 10:01.360
or the game in question a much shittier experience in English as a result. It's a topic that I'd love

10:01.360 --> 10:04.640
to cover personally, but I just don't have time. Demetri does, so you should watch him.

10:04.640 --> 10:09.040
Discordia is a friend of mine, I've always enjoyed talking to her. She works over at Sargon's Lotus

10:09.040 --> 10:13.600
Eater's outfit, which basically leaves her with no time to post her own content, but it's always

10:13.600 --> 10:18.240
been a pleasure seeing her on streams and bumping into her on on Kib's channel or whatever. I hope

10:18.240 --> 10:22.400
we can do another tabletop campaign one day. Displaced Gamers is another channel talking

10:22.400 --> 10:26.720
about the behind the scenes of video game code and how a lot of these mechanics work,

10:26.720 --> 10:31.920
but unlike the previous one, this one deals with explicitly old games, so we're talking NES and

10:31.920 --> 10:37.920
sometimes SNES games. Again, a niche topic, but very interesting to me. The DIY Doctor. Listen,

10:37.920 --> 10:42.240
you're a fatherless millennial or zoomer, right? You never had a dad who would teach you how to,

10:42.240 --> 10:47.120
you know, be a handyman, repair things around the house, that's okay. Go watch DIY Doctor.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.560
Tells you all about how to do basic jobs and tools, you know, the normal stuff you got to

10:50.560 --> 10:56.000
know to be an adult. Dylan Burns. I've spoken to Dylan a bunch of times. He is definitely a

10:56.000 --> 11:02.080
progressive, much more further left than I am, but he's not a socialist. I tend not to agree

11:02.080 --> 11:07.680
with his politics takes more than I agree with them. However, he is most well known for going

11:07.680 --> 11:12.800
to Ukraine and becoming a war reporter. And you know what? Good for him, regardless of what you

11:12.800 --> 11:19.040
think about him personally. It definitely takes stones to do this, to actually go into a war zone,

11:19.040 --> 11:24.640
get footage and bring it out. He's going back soon, in fact, so I wish him the best. Now,

11:24.640 --> 11:29.040
I know a lot of you guys don't like Econoboi and that's fine. I treat him like I treat a lot of the

11:29.040 --> 11:33.920
other specialists that I've come into contact with over the course of doing YouTube. He's very

11:33.920 --> 11:38.160
progressive and I tend not to agree with him politically, but when it comes to economics,

11:38.160 --> 11:42.080
he certainly knows more than me. Definitely well educated in this field. And you can't simply

11:42.080 --> 11:47.440
discard him by saying, ah, he's a lefty. I tend to find a lot of his stuff very educational.

11:47.440 --> 11:53.920
Flamenco is absolutely hilarious. He is basically going to become the replacement Mr.

11:53.920 --> 11:58.880
Medicker, Internet aristocrat. It seems like Medicker is not coming back due to his cancer.

11:58.880 --> 12:03.600
Flamenco is cut from the exact same cloth. He has like a similar way of speaking,

12:03.600 --> 12:09.200
a similar voice, even a similar sense of humor. He's just as autistic and he's just as hilarious.

12:09.200 --> 12:14.880
Flamenco's streams and essays tend to be really, really funny. And you can tell that he is at

12:14.880 --> 12:19.760
least somewhat effective because every time a breadtuber talks to him, they say that he is

12:20.480 --> 12:26.880
an ultra fascist. He is as far right as you can go when really all he is is a troll.

12:27.440 --> 12:32.960
Frozen Binary Studio was one of the first people that Scrump and I interviewed on Dumping with

12:32.960 --> 12:39.600
Scrump. She was a big deal in the Dreamcast hacking scene until she got a job with Google.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.560
And now, unfortunately, all the projects that I was interested that she was making

12:43.360 --> 12:47.440
have all gone by the wayside. But she is slowly coming back to the internet again.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.720
She got her Twitter account back, so I hope she gets back to it eventually.

12:50.720 --> 12:54.480
Gammy is a small time politics streamer, bigger on Twitch than on YouTube.

12:54.480 --> 12:59.120
She is kind of like a Conoboy in that she is clearly a progressive, and I don't agree with

12:59.120 --> 13:03.840
her all the time, but also like a Conoboy, she is willing to speak out against the nonsense of the

13:03.840 --> 13:08.320
socialist left. You can make deals and negotiate with welfare capitalist guys, but you can't do

13:08.320 --> 13:14.000
that with socialists. Ghost Poli- Does Ghost still do his show? I guess he does. I used to watch

13:14.000 --> 13:19.440
Ghost Politics like back in the day. Back when it was like Dark Razor Z and El Foxo Loco who were

13:19.440 --> 13:23.680
posting clips of his shows where people would call in and troll him. I don't even remember still

13:23.680 --> 13:28.880
being subbed to him. Ghost Politics is an experience. You gotta watch one of his shows

13:28.880 --> 13:34.960
to really get it. Ghost is like half serious. He's half trolling. He's a right wing Texan

13:34.960 --> 13:40.320
who's very pro capitalist, almost to the point of being an ANCAP in fact. He definitely does not

13:40.320 --> 13:45.200
like the American government. However, a lot of his show is just devoted to trolling and having

13:45.200 --> 13:52.240
callers call in and troll him. And that's honestly where the magic lies. Oh, Grumpy G-San. I'm still

13:52.240 --> 13:58.640
subbed to him. This is an old man who used to wander around the Arizona desert and review anime

13:58.640 --> 14:06.400
in the wilderness. He died 12 years ago. He was a big deal during the early internet. I kind of

14:06.720 --> 14:14.320
forgot all about him. Haryan Gladev, or Gladiev, whatever. He is a libertarian who has really,

14:14.320 --> 14:18.960
really, really wanted to talk to me. Probably about an opinion that I don't even hold anymore,

14:18.960 --> 14:25.440
in fact. But that's okay. There are some really crazy dissident right people out there who you

14:25.440 --> 14:30.800
should probably not give any consideration, but he is not one of them. He does not seem to be

14:30.800 --> 14:38.160
somebody who has been completely brain rotted by conspiratorial thinking. Iron Liz is best known as

14:38.960 --> 14:44.960
Linkara's former girlfriend. I've interviewed her a couple times. She's great. She's hilarious.

14:44.960 --> 14:52.560
And right now she's working on turning Linkara's legendary comic, The Lightbringer, into an actual

14:52.560 --> 14:56.240
comic. The first volume is already out and you should check it out. Tom Bahat is one of a

14:56.240 --> 15:02.400
collection of guys that used to run with Medicare way back in the day, including Blackface Kermitt

15:02.400 --> 15:06.640
and Latman Sun. I've talked to Latman some irregularly. He sometimes watched my content.

15:06.640 --> 15:10.880
He's been on my show at least once. Haven't seen Blackface Kermitt in a very long time. And Tom

15:10.880 --> 15:15.200
Bahat still makes his own content on his channel. These are people that I mainly just keep up with

15:15.200 --> 15:22.320
from the old days. If you like Mega Man X, then JKB Games is somebody that you want to follow.

15:22.320 --> 15:28.400
He is making a from scratch, completely new Mega Man X game called Mega Man X Corrupted.

15:28.400 --> 15:34.800
It is in the style of the X one, two and three games from the Super Nintendo. And it is probably

15:34.800 --> 15:40.080
one of the biggest fan projects that is nearing completion that I've ever seen. This is not one

15:40.080 --> 15:45.200
of those pipe dream projects where after a few years the channel goes quiet. This guy has nearly

15:45.200 --> 15:50.160
done it and it looks amazing. Justine Hoppt is an engineer who tinkers around with electronics and

15:50.160 --> 15:55.600
makes her own devices. Most recently she made a rotary cell phone, which is absolutely hilarious.

15:55.600 --> 16:00.080
And I'm sure every single hipster out there wants one. And yeah, it really works. She did all the

16:00.720 --> 16:04.240
creation of the technology behind it. She did all the programming that goes into the tech,

16:04.240 --> 16:08.960
all of it, hardware, software. She's very talented. And since I am a amateur tinkerer

16:08.960 --> 16:13.840
myself, I've enjoyed seeing some of the things that she's done. Lady Decade reminds me of Larry

16:13.840 --> 16:20.400
Bundy Jr, only just a female version. She does a lot of deep dives into obscure bits of old

16:20.400 --> 16:27.280
video game history. We're talking beta versions of games or ROM hacks or like third world clones

16:27.280 --> 16:33.200
and stuff. It's all stuff that's very interesting to me. Layman is a Canadian conservative YouTuber

16:33.200 --> 16:37.360
who makes the occasional appearance on Twitch politics panels. He and his girlfriend Anna have

16:37.360 --> 16:42.480
become decent acquaintances of mine over the past couple of years. I enjoy talking to them and I

16:42.480 --> 16:47.360
hope that this channel takes off. LoftyPixels is I think most well known for being one of the

16:47.360 --> 16:52.320
quartering's editors. And you can tell because he's made several viral clips. But they tend to

16:52.320 --> 16:56.880
go viral on Twitter, not on YouTube. Nonetheless, video and audio editing, image editing, all stuff

16:56.880 --> 17:00.480
he seems to know how to do. He's got a pretty snappy delivery in all of his jokes. And overall,

17:00.480 --> 17:07.120
just a funny channel to watch. NotRub is basically a channel that archives all of Spoonie's lost

17:07.120 --> 17:11.680
content. If you're a fan of the Spoonie one, Noah Antwiler, and you've noticed that his channel is

17:11.680 --> 17:17.360
basically a desiccated husk with most of its content scrubbed off of it, NotRub has

17:17.360 --> 17:22.640
archived as much as possible and uploaded it. This is like old reviews, old vlogs, stuff that

17:22.640 --> 17:27.920
was exclusive to BlipTV and then was lost when BlipTV finally closed. He's got a lot of it here.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.840
So if you ever wanted to go down memory lane and see when Spoonie was good, this is the channel

17:31.840 --> 17:38.880
to go to. OhohoJohSama is a channel full of laughing anime girls. That's it. That's the

17:38.880 --> 17:45.120
whole channel. I guess if you ever needed like a proper reaction video to post on Twitter or

17:45.120 --> 17:49.920
something, you could come here and grab one. But that's all this channel is. I don't even know why

17:49.920 --> 17:54.640
I'm subbed to it. Politics with Paint is another channel like Krauts and that it's a polnball

17:54.640 --> 17:59.200
channel like Kraut and like Hoser and like a lot of these other politics channels. This is

17:59.200 --> 18:03.680
all stuff that interests me personally because it has a focus on history and it uses polnballs.

18:03.680 --> 18:08.080
You know what this is. You know if you like it, check it out. Rachel Richards is a viewer of mine

18:08.080 --> 18:14.480
and is an anti-leftist trans woman. A lot of her content is vlogs about trans issues from a

18:14.480 --> 18:19.440
non-leftist perspective, which by the way is kind of a refreshing perspective to see since the left

18:19.440 --> 18:24.160
claims all trans people as their own. She hasn't done very much and she has one niche, but what

18:24.160 --> 18:29.040
she does is done well. Ravignon is another person that I met through Kraut and he is probably one of

18:29.040 --> 18:34.800
the only people that I've encountered that is both a socialist and actually somewhat honest.

18:34.800 --> 18:39.600
It's a very rare thing. I've spoken with him privately a lot and we have some very rowdy

18:39.600 --> 18:44.720
debates. He's helped me sharpen up a lot of my ideas especially ideas about the left and really

18:44.720 --> 18:50.320
it's so rare to see an actual honest socialist who you know isn't evil that he's probably worth

18:50.320 --> 18:56.160
following just for that alone. Raydude, this is a channel that is basically dead. It's fine though

18:56.160 --> 19:03.760
because his claim to fame is that he made the legendary Newgrounds animation Link's Quest for

19:03.760 --> 19:08.880
Ass back when I was in high school. And though his channel is mostly just talking about games

19:08.880 --> 19:13.920
and doing some speedruns and stuff he also has a series of documentaries talking about the making

19:13.920 --> 19:18.400
of that legendary animation which I found to be hilarious to watch. It was like I was back in high

19:18.400 --> 19:22.320
school again. So much fun. If you remember the old days of Newgrounds you definitely want to check

19:22.320 --> 19:27.680
this guy out. Riley Grace Rochon is another politics streamer who was cancelled and driven

19:27.680 --> 19:31.440
off the internet by leftoids. She's been trying to become a professional lawyer I think for a

19:31.440 --> 19:36.080
long time and the leftoids actually called I think her bar association to try to get her

19:36.080 --> 19:40.000
career fucked up. Didn't work out but she's decided to take a break from the internet.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.600
I hope she'll be back one day because she's very intelligent and this will be the channel that you

19:43.600 --> 19:48.960
want to follow her on if she does ever return. Rose Mullet or is it Mulay I don't know. She's

19:48.960 --> 19:54.960
another trans non-leftist who has been slowly making her name of herself in the online politics

19:54.960 --> 20:00.000
space over on Twitch. It's honestly really refreshing to me to see trans perspectives

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
outside of leftist dogma. Also she does music too but I think most people are here for her politics.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.560
And here's my friend Rose of Dawn. She used to do a lot of political content but she's since taken

20:10.560 --> 20:16.320
a break from that. She is a non-leftist but she's also more explicitly pro right wing than a lot of

20:16.320 --> 20:21.360
the other trans women we've talked about today. Which is by the way why Shinigami Eyes marks her

20:21.360 --> 20:26.320
as red. But she has been a bit burnt out on politics recently so she's she's taken some

20:26.320 --> 20:31.840
time off from that. Rosa Kotel is a vtuber, a snake vtuber that I follow and that I'm

20:31.840 --> 20:35.440
kind of acquaintances with. And in fact I might as well just lump all the vtubers that I follow

20:35.440 --> 20:40.800
in right now because I'm not much of a vtube person and there's tons of vtubers nowadays.

20:40.800 --> 20:46.560
So I might as well just recommend to you the ones that I think are small and interesting. Rosa, Tomo,

20:46.560 --> 20:52.880
bat at video games and vote for waifus. You know what vtubers are about? Cute anime avatars, cute

20:52.880 --> 20:57.040
voices, playing video games. You all know why you're here. You're here to simp. You're here to

20:57.040 --> 21:01.120
jack off. I get it. It's okay. These four are the ones that are the most interesting to me.

21:01.120 --> 21:08.880
Shenmue fans! Pretty much is in the title isn't it? This is a channel for the Dreamcast sleeper

21:08.880 --> 21:13.520
hit Shenmue. Has a cult following nowadays. If you like Shenmue you know what this is about. If you

21:13.520 --> 21:19.520
don't, not for you. Side Scrollers is back! In fact they're they're live now while I'm recording

21:19.520 --> 21:24.000
this. Side Scrollers was a podcast on screwattack.com headed up by Stuttering Craig.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.880
Stuttering Craig has revived the side scroller's name for his new channel. Basically Stuttering

21:28.880 --> 21:33.520
Craig built up ScrewAttack. He sold it to Rooster Teeth. He then went off on his own, restarted his

21:33.520 --> 21:38.320
channel. He's doing his own thing and he's bringing side scrollers back. So good for him. If you like

21:38.320 --> 21:42.320
the old side scrollers back in the day, I know my editor Dave does. He listened to that podcast a

21:42.320 --> 21:46.880
lot on the bus going off to uh going off to college every day. If you liked it back then,

21:46.880 --> 21:51.360
he's doing it again. Single Player Carl is another viewer of mine. He's another one of those guys

21:51.360 --> 21:56.560
that met during gamergate. He's more prevalent on Twitter than he is on YouTube. But he is trying

21:56.560 --> 22:01.840
to branch out into YouTube with some of his own content. As well as a program that he calls the

22:01.840 --> 22:08.880
fried chicanery podcast. He's kind of like Poe in that he's a non-leftist black guy who talks about

22:08.880 --> 22:13.760
black politics and culture. He's always really funny whenever I see him and he is worth a follow.

22:13.760 --> 22:19.600
Sansol is one of those poor souls who used to be a breadtuber and has since broken out of their

22:19.600 --> 22:24.720
orbit. Back when he was a breadtuber he uh he was actually quite hostile towards me. He has since

22:24.720 --> 22:30.080
apologized for that. We've had a few conversations and he's definitely like uh my god I can't believe

22:30.080 --> 22:36.640
how how dumb I was back in the day. He actually reminds me a lot of me when I was a communist.

22:36.640 --> 22:40.160
Though I was younger than him when I was a communist. Whenever he describes a lot of his

22:40.480 --> 22:46.720
time in the radical left he he frames it like that he knew deep down that none of this would

22:46.720 --> 22:51.600
ever work. But he was kind of suppressing it because one he didn't like the current system

22:51.600 --> 22:56.160
and two he wanted to keep all of his friends like Vosh and stuff. But then finally the contradictions

22:56.160 --> 23:00.560
of the system became too great and he basically found himself at a crossroads where he could just

23:00.560 --> 23:05.920
be a grifter and lie. Or he could you know pull the band-aid off start speaking the truth and it

23:05.920 --> 23:09.680
would be costly for him and it was he lost all of his friends. Which is why his channel is much

23:09.760 --> 23:13.360
smaller than it used to be. BreadTube absolutely hates him now in the same way that they hate

23:13.360 --> 23:17.760
Chud Logic for for daring to leave them. Sophia Nowitz is just great. I first interviewed her

23:17.760 --> 23:23.840
during um the George Floyd riots where she was doing on the ground reporting. Since she's local

23:23.840 --> 23:26.960
to the area she went down there with her camera she was recording what was going on and she

23:26.960 --> 23:32.000
described to me during that interview she had been kind of in a slump in her life and doing the on

23:32.000 --> 23:37.280
the ground reporting invigorated her life again. And now she's like she she does do the twitch

23:37.280 --> 23:41.360
streaming thing she does review games and she does like all the kind of game journo stuff

23:41.360 --> 23:45.920
again from a non-hegemonic leftist perspective she's very much not part of the left. But when

23:45.920 --> 23:50.320
there's an opportunity to do like real on the ground politics reporting she does that too.

23:50.320 --> 23:55.520
I enjoy her streams, I enjoy her reviews, I enjoy her takes on twitter. She is the full package deal.

23:55.520 --> 24:01.840
Stardust is cut from the same cloth as people like Chud Logic and Cherry and Flamenco and some

24:01.840 --> 24:06.960
and Sansol. These are all people who are heavily engaged in the twitch politics sphere. They're not

24:07.040 --> 24:12.000
socialists and they're really spicy. Though Stardust is a progressive she also has a very

24:12.000 --> 24:16.560
good head on her shoulders. She's not afraid of admitting when she's wrong or when her political

24:16.560 --> 24:21.440
side is fucked up some some way. She's not really a partisan she's not really ideologically bent and

24:21.440 --> 24:26.800
she is one of the few people that I've met in the twitch politics space that I can honestly say has

24:26.800 --> 24:32.400
a good faith conversation every single time. And she's also one of the only ones in that space

24:32.400 --> 24:38.640
who's willing to talk to people outside of let's say the the leftist orthodoxy and she gets a lot

24:38.640 --> 24:43.360
of shit for it. There's constantly conversations about is Stardust platforming people responsibly

24:43.360 --> 24:47.680
and I've always told her she should just tell them to fuck off have the conversations you want to

24:47.680 --> 24:53.360
have and I respect her for it so you should follow her. The Halfling formerly known as Paleo-Anglism

24:53.360 --> 24:57.760
who was formerly known as British Knight. He's been watching me for years I've been on his

24:57.760 --> 25:02.320
channel a couple times he's very close to being an AnCap and I do not agree with his politics at all

25:02.560 --> 25:07.600
but unlike most radicals he's very polite and I can often have a good faith conversation with him.

25:07.600 --> 25:12.800
Due to IRL stuff he has less time to make content than he used to but he is planning to come back

25:12.800 --> 25:20.080
soon with something or other I guess we'll see. The Offensive Tranny is a female to male trans

25:20.080 --> 25:26.160
person who is again presenting a non-leftist trans perspective on a lot of these trans topics.

25:26.160 --> 25:30.880
He reminds me a lot of Blair White though obviously he's more masculine and Blair is more

25:30.880 --> 25:36.160
feminine and Blair is also way more popular but he seems to be cut from the same cloth so if you

25:36.160 --> 25:40.480
like that sort of thing you should check him out. Oh yeah the Snit Zone if you're Canadian you know

25:40.480 --> 25:47.600
exactly what this is. YTV very famous Canadian television channel for children had a host for

25:47.600 --> 25:53.840
the in-between cartoon segments that was a TV covered in purple goop whose name was Snit.

25:53.840 --> 25:57.280
Probably one of the biggest things that any Canadian millennial remembers about the 90s

25:57.280 --> 26:01.920
is Snit's antics and the fact that he's been revived and given his own YouTube channel is just

26:01.920 --> 26:07.760
hilarious to me. The Britisher does primarily The Week That Was which is a pretty good replacement

26:07.760 --> 26:13.040
for Sargon's This Week in Stupid. When I was banned a few years back he hosted one of my videos

26:13.040 --> 26:19.040
My Weekly Sip until I got my channel back which is very kind of him. He is very much a classical

26:19.040 --> 26:23.040
liberal type so if you're into Sargon's older stuff or if you're into me or V or somebody he's

26:23.040 --> 26:27.920
definitely worth checking out. Then finally Warren Ray otherwise known as Bastiat. He is a

26:27.920 --> 26:34.000
self-identified neoliberal he's probably the most high profile neoliberal in the twitch politics

26:34.000 --> 26:39.840
sphere and he basically argues for normalcy. I have my problems with neolibs I'm sure we all do

26:39.840 --> 26:44.160
but Bastiat's got a pretty good head on shoulders he knows what's going on. And there we are those

26:44.160 --> 26:49.440
are all the channels that I'm subbed to that are under 100,000 subs and you guys should be checking

26:49.440 --> 26:54.160
them all out. Of course this thank you for a hundred thousand subs video would not be complete

26:54.160 --> 27:00.720
without actually thanking some people. There is of course my closest internet friends Sargon, Arch,

27:00.720 --> 27:07.680
Vee, Kibz and Lilith. These five people have helped me immensely in more ways than I can count.

27:07.680 --> 27:12.160
If you watch me you already know who they all are and I cannot thank them enough for everything.

27:12.160 --> 27:15.520
There's also a number of other people who have given me a lot of help over the years too. The

27:15.520 --> 27:22.080
efap guys rags mauler and fringy the tism guys baring dankula and the quartering adam friended

27:22.080 --> 27:27.680
and psa sitch from the adam and sitch sunday show madri bread the let's player and pokemon challenge

27:27.680 --> 27:33.920
youtuber taftaj a former sfo fangirl turned friend zaver somebody i've known for over a decade now

27:33.920 --> 27:39.760
spooky minaris and denziel the borderlands crew see hoff manny otherwise known as harper one of

27:39.760 --> 27:43.600
my most lasting friends that i met during gamergate though she's definitely not pro

27:43.600 --> 27:48.480
gamergate anymore but that's fine singing reaper who has the unique distinction of being the only

27:48.480 --> 27:53.840
red tube viewer i've ever met who is nonetheless not retarded there's kraut who i became friends

27:53.840 --> 27:58.000
with while he was off the internet i realized that i was pretty much wrong about everything i

27:58.000 --> 28:03.200
had said about him during the dumping with scrump days i apologized he forgave me and we became

28:03.200 --> 28:09.120
pals and there's colink someone who is uh semi local to the area and who as long as we keep

28:09.120 --> 28:13.840
growing here will be the first employee who is not one of my irl friends these are all people

28:13.840 --> 28:17.360
who have helped me out over the years and i appreciate all of them there is of course a

28:17.360 --> 28:22.800
special thank for all of my moderators both past and present as well as the people who both work

28:22.800 --> 28:28.960
and i guess unofficially intern here at the channel my lifelong friend dave my girlfriend

28:28.960 --> 28:33.840
naomi and dave's girlfriend dom don't worry there'll be more money soon i hope as long as

28:33.840 --> 28:38.240
you keep growing thanks very much to everyone who's helped me out over the years and of course

28:38.240 --> 28:42.320
thanks to you for watching i wouldn't have come this far without you i'm not going to cry like

28:42.320 --> 28:47.200
mundane matt did over his uh his silver play button and i'm under no illusions that i'm

28:47.200 --> 28:50.960
ever going to get to a million within my lifetime or otherwise but hey who knows it might happen

28:50.960 --> 28:54.640
i guess i'll have to see all right everyone thanks for sticking with me for this uh

28:54.640 --> 28:59.440
absurdly long thank you video i will see you guys next time i love you
