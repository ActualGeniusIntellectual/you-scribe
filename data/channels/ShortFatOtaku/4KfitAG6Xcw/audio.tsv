0	9040	Hello, everyone. Welcome back to us watching The Last of Us. This will be episodes four
9040	13840	and five. We missed a few. So it turns out, Lilith, that you couldn't make it for episode
13840	17760	three due to some IRL shenanigans. So you got all caught up.
17760	22680	Yep. I watched episode three, actually just today.
22680	30920	And then episodes, basically, we missed episode four, because Arch, you had some sort of IRL
30920	33000	stuff to do with your job, right? You couldn't be around?
34280	37720	I was occupied, oh yes, I had to get up super early in the morning,
37720	39800	and I would have gotten about two hours of sleep.
42680	48040	And episode five, it turns out, actually came out a couple of days ago, but because it was,
48040	53640	it was preempted because tonight is the Super Bowl. And in fact, my IRL friends are off watching
53640	59480	the Super Bowl, and I'm a nerd, recluse, and I don't care about sports ball, so I'm here
59480	63880	watching The Last of Us with you guys. Let's talk about the sports ball. So as far
63880	67640	as I understand, there's a racist team against a group of birds.
68520	73320	Oh, is that how it is? Is it the Redskins or whatever? I don't know the teams.
73320	81240	One is called the Chiefs. I don't think they're Native Americans though, so that's really racist.
81240	85560	Yeah, because Arch, you're Norwegian, you don't really care about American hand egg.
85560	91800	And Lilith, you never seem like a sporty type to me. But Kibbs, you live in the American
91800	97800	heartland. How are you not watching sports ball like your brothers?
97800	107720	Sports boring. Well, there we go. He has a, he has a personal trauma with the hand egg.
107720	113480	So, oh, really can't watch it anymore. What's the story? What's the story? It fell on me in school.
113480	120280	I broke my collarbone. Is that true? That did. But that wasn't the reason why I don't watch sports.
120280	126520	I just, I don't like watching. Like, I, I like to play. No, I'm kind of the same much better reason
126520	132280	though. Like if, you know, you see the sports ball and you just imagine the enormous tuckas
132280	139640	coming towards you. No, it was his knee. And it would, like, it's not the, it's not the hands.
139640	144680	Well, here Kibbs, you know what? I, next time we play sports, I'll fall on you just,
144680	147960	just to round it out, okay? Devil, shoot you if you do that.
149640	152680	If I can, you know, move my arms, assuming, because what breaks.
153240	159080	Thanks. So we're, we're going to watch episodes four and five today. And, but first Lilith,
159880	166360	you wanted to give your take on episode three since, you know, a brief take because
166360	171160	you, you weren't here last time. Yeah, I thought it was pretty well handled. Like,
171800	177320	they depicted a libertarian character and who was like, libertarian representation.
178040	182760	Yes, libertarian representation with the don't tread on me and everything. And,
183640	188280	which is to be expected if you play like the game. Well, if you're familiar with the Bill character
188280	195160	who helps out Joel and Ellie and anyways, who's just basically like a prepper and a handyman
195160	201320	and can build all sorts of traps and resulted in one of the more memorable scenes in the game,
201320	207560	where it's like, Joel's just hung upside down by the leg and has to shoot zombies while Ellie gets
207560	212680	him down. Oh, that part was actually quite hard. I remember being very frustrated playing that
212680	215560	because like your controls are fucking inverted. Jesus.
217240	221000	You've got libertarians here, you've got gun-toting zero immigration
221000	224200	fucking build a fence now. It's like, that's woke. Is it?
224200	235080	It's about as chat as they get if, if only Frank was like a woman and like, it's like
235080	241400	perfect picturesque married couple living together, supporting each other and make,
241400	247800	making sure enriching each other's lives and having a homestead and harming and all that
247800	255080	trat stuff, but they don't like it because Frank is a man who speaks in gay or the crossing sword.
256760	263640	And like the, the actual like radical left gay stereotype are the people who are like
264280	269640	pissing all over each other on the pride float with, with children watching. And it's like,
269640	275240	that's not what these guys are about. You know? Yeah. The thing is, if you were to change,
275240	279240	if we were to go back change, the fact that it's not the last was take the same story arc
279240	283240	and literally change one of the characters into a girl. I guarantee you there's other people at
283240	288200	base to be speech. Like that's all that no one would have any problem with it. And that's okay.
288200	292680	So the director guy was like, Oh, I put the gay in there. It's like a trick. I fed it to you in
292680	297560	the brownie. I don't care. Like I've never been an opposition to gay people. And you've just
297560	303000	presented me with a perfectly fine conservative romance. Like, yup. You didn't trick me into
303000	306840	anything. You checked yourself, bro. They didn't really change anything. It's like,
306840	313240	uh, bill is gay in the game. Like, uh, the only difference was, uh, they changed the ending. Yeah.
313240	315960	This one, they had a happy ending where they didn't get separated.
317000	324120	Literally the only point of quote unquote propaganda is that it's a hyper idealized ending
324120	327640	and it is like all of their machinery is working. They still have fuel. They still have
327640	332520	fancy dinners. They still have fucking wine. Like, um, I was really surprised when they,
332520	339000	when they cast, uh, Nick Offerman as the, uh, libertarian survivalist bill, by the way,
339000	345320	it was like, that's like the perfect fricking casting because, uh, Ron Swanson and just like
345320	350040	the most memeable libertarian character in television. I watched it again with Naomi,
350040	353880	right? Cause she wanted to see the episode too. And it was a good episode. So I didn't
353960	357640	mind watching it again. And I noticed something subtle about it. I didn't notice the first time
357640	365800	through. Um, when you see bill, like, you know, before he meets up with Frank, you know, there's
365800	369800	the army's going around clearing out all the houses and he's, he's in his bunker and he's like
370520	374280	new world order fucks, w E F motherfucker. You're not going to get me out of here.
374280	381560	He seemed like your average, you know, off the grid Republican voter at the start of the, um,
381640	387000	at the start of his story, he's like, you know, he's, he's hiding, he's, he's, he's very handy.
387000	390520	He's doing things for himself. He doesn't care about other, he doesn't care so much about our
390520	395000	society. You know, he's, he's keeping to himself. He's, he's building up his compound. Um, he's
395000	399960	happy that other people are gone. And however, he also seems like in after watching it the second
399960	405880	time, he's probably closeted gay, you know, and then when Frank comes along and he realizes that
405880	412520	Frank is also gay, that moment when they're both in bed, they're both lying in bed. And Frank asks
412520	417160	him, have you ever had sex with another man before? And he nervously says no, only with a
417160	423800	girl. Once when I was younger, it seemed to me that bill was like, probably closeted, probably
423800	429880	a little bit homophobic, but now that society's fallen apart, he can basically do whatever he
429880	435800	wants without being judged by whoever was around him before. And so he's taking this chance with
435800	442360	Frank. There basically can't be a more pro gay story than that of a guy coming out of the closet
443240	446360	after years of repression and then finding a romance.
446360	450840	Apparently Ben Shapiro got super duper pissed off about Bill and Frank.
450840	455640	Oh, yes. That's one thing we should talk about real quick. So Arch, last episode, you basically
455640	460200	said that this was a good romance and I think you repeated it today. It was a good romance.
460200	464920	It was a good representation of a positive representation of a conservative gay romance.
464920	469240	And in fact, Arch, I think you, you milked this topic on your channel for all it was worth. You
469240	473800	did like three videos on how the right should be claiming Bill and Frank. Is that, is that correct?
473800	474040	No.
475240	475800	Milked.
475800	476520	You squeezed.
476520	483880	That's not really, this turned into a controversy is not really the right word because there were
483880	488120	people who disagreed with my take on this. And I think it is because we are too used to being
488120	491800	defensive. We have to be against things because we have to counter the woke. But
491800	497800	again, the thing is, if you did this romance and you made Frank into a big breasted blonde woman,
497800	502120	nobody would have any problems with this at all. And, you know, it wouldn't be an issue.
502840	507640	If anything, the only complaint would be the same that I have, that it was overly idealized
507640	512840	and that they had no problems whatsoever. Really. There's like one raid that was easily repelled by
512840	517800	the electrified fucking fence. I do think the right should be claiming these characters because
517800	523240	they are clearly hashtag our side. So to say these, these are libertarians. They are not woke.
523240	528920	They don't seem there was, how do I put it? Like at no point did they bring in politics into their
528920	535080	relationship. They didn't sit around the table going like, Oh, I was pressed under a patriarchy
535080	540200	or anything like that. It was just two people who fell in love and I don't see anything wrong with
540200	545320	that. So you sent me a little Twitter post from some breadtuber who was like, Oh God, I can't
545320	550040	wait for the conservatives to see this. They'll be seething and molding. This is exactly why we
550040	558360	should be claiming these two characters because nothing would piss the workers off more than
558360	566120	having the, cause they've owned the identity of gay now for 20 years and they've used it as a
566120	570360	political tool. Taking it away from them has got to be the funniest thing we could possibly do.
570520	576920	So what you're talking about arch is that a Xander hall made this post me watching Nick Offerman get
576920	582120	a blow job for another man in the last of us and imagining the reaction of the chud YouTubers who
582120	588600	have to watch the scene to review the episode. Now, firstly, like this is Xander hall, dude,
588600	593080	you got to stop thinking you got to unplug from the culture, the culture war. Okay. Because you
593080	597800	probably shouldn't be thinking about like, you're gonna sit down with your girlfriend or with your
597800	601240	friends or whoever with your discord, whoever you're gonna sit down and watch a wholesome
601240	607240	hour of TV, have a good time. And what you're thinking of is, man, I bet the people that I
607240	611480	hate on the internet are mad right now. It's like, Jesus Christ, dude, Xander hall, what the fuck?
611480	615160	You gotta, you gotta like turn off the internet and put down the bong or something like Christ.
616120	620280	See, I don't know what a Xander hall is. So I don't know the context here, but
620280	625480	uh, okay. Listen, listen arch. I presume he's a communist judging by
626040	633000	Vash with minus 20 IQ points and too much weed. That's Andrew. So in reply to Xander hall,
633000	640600	there was one guy named comrade giga Chad. He, him who says, surprisingly, they don't hate it.
640600	646760	At least this one doesn't. And then links your video arch. It links your video.
646760	651160	And then somebody else responded to like, it makes me worried. What are they getting out of it? I'm
651160	655400	like, it's just two conservatives having a romance. That's all I'm getting out of it.
655960	661080	See, I'm going to do a video on this, right? Because at some point I'll do a video. I have
661080	667000	to flush this out a little bit, a little bit more, but basically the right knows what the left looks
667000	672760	like from the point of view of being inside the left, but the left has no clue what the right
672760	677320	looks like from being, from the point of view of being inside the right. And there's a clear,
677320	680680	there's a clear like imbalance there between the knowledge of each other.
681480	687320	And that's why I think we're seeing stuff like this of why does a right winger like arch Warhammer
687320	692280	like a con like a gay romance? And it's like, Hmm, maybe you need to reevaluate how you view
692280	696680	the fucking world dude. But well, actually, that's an interesting idea you have there.
696680	701640	Cause I hadn't thought about that. I've seen, I figured that they would be able to,
702600	708440	how do I put this? Like all the shit that people say about me, I figured they were just lying
708440	713480	because it seemed like a good attack angle, but they might also just not understand. Cause I have
713480	721720	never at any point said, I've been anti-gay, but at least I can't remember. You know what it is?
721960	731880	I just assumed like, Oh, you're somebody who is on the right. And therefore you must hate the gays.
731880	736280	Well, it could be that it could also be the fact that people on the left tend to take jokes,
736280	742440	like as not just a joke, but as a dog whistle for what you actually believe. So if you make
742440	746040	jokes at the expense of gay people, that means that you actually secretly hate gay people.
746040	749880	That's a very common thing the left does. So maybe that's what they're doing because
749880	754280	all of us here, including you, Lilith, even though you try to keep a damper on it because
754280	757960	you don't want to get canceled. But I understand. I understand. I know what lies in your dark heart.
757960	762120	Actually, all of us here have made like jokes at the expense of gay people,
762120	768120	but they're jokes. And we know that we're jokes, but you're saying we know that they're jokes.
768120	773080	And we know that we're all actually cool with them. You know, when we say breed Kibs,
773080	778680	we don't mean to actually like denigrate Kibs because he's a gay bottom. All right.
778680	783080	We're just having we're just having fun. Oh, no, just make it.
785560	792360	You say at the expense of like, I don't think of it like that. For me, the the core
792360	798280	fundamental of all humor is absurdity. And sure, homophobia is a fairly absurd concept,
798280	801560	like being afraid of gays. The issue is, though, is that Arch,
801560	806520	while you were doing your milk and a lot of your a lot of your comments were saying stuff like,
806520	811400	No, we actually shouldn't claim Bill and Frank. And they were fighting back with you. Like,
811400	815720	I know I've been getting into into fights with my comments section. But this time you've been like,
815720	820200	you've been taking some hits over this. Not really. Like a grand total. I lost six
820200	831720	subscribers, which, oh, no, no, I've lost a few too. Like, I'm not the kind of guy who's like,
831720	836280	oh, they didn't matter or anything like that. But the things I felt like I had a very
836280	842040	good, frank discussion with my community over it. We did a stream, I talked to them,
842040	846280	we had a conversation back and forth, they kept to tell me their arguments, I got to tell them theirs.
848360	851640	I think it worked out fairly well, honestly. No, fair enough. Like, I'm not saying that,
851640	854600	like, oh, no, you lost subscribers. I'm not saying that. But like, I looked at the comments
854600	857960	in some of those videos. And they were like, no, these are degenerates. Some people were
857960	862760	saying shit like that. Like, oh, Jesus, you also got to remember, like, when it comes to the
862760	868120	creative sphere and in feedback, and then when it comes to critique, always the most loudest voices
868120	872920	are often those that are going to be the most vulgar sometimes. Yeah, that goes for whether
872920	876440	you're making a video game and you release it and be like, oh, I hate these mechanics,
876440	883000	you know, or you're just making a video, like, they're just gonna rise to the top, the scum
883000	886760	rises to the surface. There are there were a lot of comments actually read that were actually
886760	890840	pretty well mannered, and pretty well, well constructed. And they actually raised some
890840	894120	excellent points. And we brought those up on stream and we had a good chat about it.
894120	897800	Then we get to what you mentioned to start this whole section off Lilith,
897800	907880	which was Ben Shapiro's video called Brokeback Zombie Farm. And it's like, come on, dude. Ben,
907880	915000	what the fuck? Now, Ben Shapiro, like he's obviously like a partisan rightoid. So like,
915000	919880	this is expected to come out of him, right? But he did the whole culture war. I can't believe
919880	925480	they're shoehorning the gays into this perfectly fine The Last of Us show. And it's like, Ben,
925480	931240	what are you doing? Come on. I know clicks. I get it. I get it. You know, your video had half a
931240	934600	million views pregnant, made some money off of it. I get it. You have a company to fund. This is
934600	939480	just partisan hackery. It is indeed difficult to argue they shoehorned in since it was in the
940120	945480	game. It was in the game. They gave them a happier ending, and they spent far more time on it. And
945480	949400	I'm still not sure that was worth it. We'll have to see how the rest of the show turns out because
949400	954920	this was an entire episode dedicated to a pair of side characters. Yeah, so because here's the
954920	959400	thing in the original game, Bill and Frank don't come back after the segment. So you're not gonna
959400	963480	get any payoff. And they're also unless they change it unless they change it. So actually,
963480	968040	we didn't die. I decided not to kill myself. And it's just the other guy dead in there.
972040	976600	If we get to see more Nick Offerman, I mean, yeah, but I don't they'd ruin the story bringing
976600	981880	them back, though. Yeah, they probably would. Yeah. I don't know if you all watched Ben Shapiro's
981880	989880	video on this. I did watch it. He just he spends the whole time complaining from a purely culture
989880	997000	warrior perspective. You know, it's like, Oh, this is the LGBT ideology lobby pushing
997000	1002440	gays into your TV again. And it's like, listen, you gotta, you gotta calm the fuck down with
1002440	1008920	us, Ben. Like, no, things have swung too far in the other direction. Now, right, like,
1008920	1013560	five or six years ago, we were complaining about them shoehorning in trans people or gay people
1013560	1017320	where it didn't matter race swapping to black characters where it didn't matter. And it's like,
1017320	1022920	this is kind of cringy. Like, what the fuck are you doing? Now, though, the reaction to that has
1022920	1028440	become so severe that anytime you see like a gay person in the media, these people are like flying
1028440	1032920	off the handle. And it's become too much in the other direction now. Yes, we our side is in the
1032920	1038920	ascendancy. And we need to recognize that rather than continuing on the defense. It feels just like
1038920	1046200	a money farm or a click farm. It's just like, oh, that's, oh, this is another thing where I get to
1046200	1053640	get riled up and make lots of angry clicks with like, oh, it's so cynical, like gays have been
1053720	1058600	appearing in television since forever. It's like now we're seeing more of it because now we're
1058600	1066120	seeing there are more gays and oh, gee, the FCC doesn't fine you thousands and thousands of
1066120	1073480	dollars if you show homosexuals in a non-negative light on television. Oh, I think he will also
1073480	1080200	complain about that two second clip of lesbians kissing in Buzz Lightyear too, didn't he? Yeah,
1080200	1085240	I think so. That was stupid. If he has to go to war with Steven Crowder, he needs all the money
1085240	1093720	he can get, you know? So basically like, like righty tube is doing the same thing that lefty
1093720	1099880	tube went through or like lefty twitch, you know, they're just eating each other at this point.
1099880	1104120	They've like isolated off into their own little internets. And now they're in fighting for,
1104760	1110680	for clout. And I was, it's funny to laugh at when it happens on the, on the left. And it's
1110680	1115720	funny to laugh at when it happens on the right. And I think that basically Ben Shapiro losing it
1115720	1121880	over Bill and Frank is just a small component of that larger issue of it's just people scrabbling
1121880	1129320	for relevance. The inevitable spiral, it happened to Gamegate after people realized that once the,
1129320	1134280	the video game journalists horse had been beaten thoroughly to death,
1134280	1137320	a lot of people realized, well, we might not actually agree on everything.
1137960	1142120	And then a lot of egos in a very small room, et cetera, et cetera, and it's happening to the
1142120	1147480	left on red tube, et cetera. And it's happening again. Now, this is just the natural cycle of
1147480	1152120	content creation. I think I know a lot is going to be cut out, but we've been talking for like
1152120	1157160	nearly an hour and a half just shooting the shit. So maybe it's time, maybe it's time we should
1157160	1160360	actually watch the show. We have two episodes to get through.
1162360	1167240	Listen, I miss you guys. All right. It's a good time. You know, you could come in any time. We
1167240	1171800	stream a lot Bart and I know, I know, but usually I'm busy. Like I'm also working on things.
1172840	1179400	That's no excuse. You can always find time at somebody who has time management problems myself.
1180120	1182280	You know what I'll do? I'll break up with my girlfriend for you.
1183240	1187000	I'll, I'll free up some time that way. Jesus.
1187000	1193400	Kibbs you have more. You're so demanding now. I'll start dating Kibbs. Okay.
1193400	1198280	Arch. Now I understand. And now I understand the, the, the dynamic here, what's going on
1198840	1202760	of, of why kids need to be, needs to be bullied. Cause otherwise he just sucks up all your free
1202760	1209720	time. He does. He's a woman. I have got queued up in the pipe episode. I think it's not for
1209720	1217960	me to still check. Yes. Episode four. Let's roll. It's currently black. I'm playing it right now.
1220840	1221160	Okay.
1231800	1233080	This is what I always expect.
1239720	1247400	I think the guitar at least. Yeah.
1250680	1257080	You know what? Unlike the rings of power, this song actually makes the intro worth watching.
1257080	1260920	I think it's a nice song. They actually incorporate it into the show too.
1262440	1267000	That's sort of what they're doing with like the new Mario movie from the looks of it too.
1267960	1273640	Yep. Yep. Hello aircraft carrier. It's been long since last time.
1274920	1279080	Fuck. There were some comments who were saying, arch, that you're too mean to this girl.
1280600	1285480	You know, she might be, but is she like, she, she does not fit the character. She just,
1286520	1292600	I'm sure she's a lovely human being, but at least she knows basic gun safety.
1292600	1302920	Yeah. I hope so. For giving her a gun. Oh, she found it. Oh, that's right. If he took
1305080	1310200	I expect to be gangster. Tilt the weapon. It lingers accuracy.
1312600	1317240	Put the safety on, man. You don't want to just randomly going off cause it hooks something in
1317240	1322600	your bag. Fun fact, the French rifles of the second world war did not have safeties.
1324440	1329560	So they just would go off. It was a bit unfortunate occasionally.
1331240	1337880	Yeah, no. Uh, if, if Litchin is growing on the cars, I guarantee you that fuel is not
1337880	1345720	usable. That would be jello years and years and years ago. 20 years. How long does gas last in
1345720	1353240	a tank a year? Like it lasts a year in an underground to be fair. This is something
1353240	1357400	that every single survival setting gets wrong. It'll still be stationary.
1359880	1367240	No pun intended volume two, but will Livingston volume two. Wait, is it a, this is a puns book.
1367800	1371400	Okay. This is the best show, the best character, the best episode. I love
1372280	1373880	already. Yes.
1385640	1391080	Feel free to wait in the truck. Okay. But just know you can't escape. We'll Livingston.
1392040	1394760	You'll be back. There's nothing you can do to stop him.
1394760	1404120	At least somebody cleared out the cars from being on the road. Very convenient of them.
1404120	1408520	Yeah. They conveniently just 45 degree parked them. Yeah. They used to take big ass plows
1408520	1412360	on them and clear the roads for their tanks. And so they actually explained it.
1415560	1421960	Oh wait, they're doing the yep. Right on the reading, but it has some interesting pictures.
1421960	1428200	No, no, no, no. Put that back. That's not for kids. Please get rid of it. That's actually
1428200	1443720	kind of funny pages stuck together. Who knows? I know what coom is.
1445960	1448760	Okay. So that was shot for shot identical from the game.
1449320	1453560	Yes. Yeah. She finds the gay porn from bill stash.
1467240	1472360	You know, that one picture that people use to show like the downfall of America by having all
1472360	1478280	these like McDonald's and Arby's and all these restaurants. This is, it kind of looks like that.
1479240	1480920	That place, but the post-apocalypse.
1487400	1495240	Wow. That, that one spot of grass was clearly driven over several times for this shot.
1495240	1498440	That and the fact that, you know, you can clearly tell it's been mowed.
1502200	1504120	20 year old raviolis, dude.
1508760	1514680	Am I even eating that is 20 year old ship where do you ravioli? I actually agree.
1518440	1521560	So can we start a fire? I'm freezing. Now, why am I going to tell you? No,
1522600	1525640	because in fact, you don't see the smoke fungus in that smart.
1527080	1528680	This is about to say, anyway,
1530440	1538200	people remote, the fungal zombies just hang out and populated areas for some reason.
1538920	1546120	It's because of the all the connections with the fungus going underground. They stay in like urban
1546120	1552680	centers, literally just live outside the city and you'll be fine. Okay. So they're literally left.
1555880	1558440	Wait, the pun book, the pun book. She better say some more.
1558440	1560760	Why did the scarecrow get an award?
1567160	1569080	Because he was outstanding in his field.
1572920	1578200	This is sweet. The Joel and Ellie father and daughter moment. Those were like my favorite
1578200	1581160	parts in the game too. It actually makes me want to go out and camping.
1582120	1583320	Have you been camping before?
1586440	1587400	Man, I hate camping.
1589080	1593960	Correct. No one camping once. It was awful. Oh, it's percolator coffee.
1594600	1601320	How am I more outdoorsy than the two men? I live in Norway. The outdoors here will kill you.
1601960	1606440	I mean, same with Canada, right? Like, yeah, these are all woman excuses.
1609480	1615160	I would love to put you outside my backyard. Just 12 hours. Just 12.
1615880	1618200	Okay. I'm fine.
1623160	1630280	No, you can't. Yeah. I did scouts training on how to do it. You love it. Okay. I'll just
1630280	1635880	put you outside. No gear. Go sleep in the fucking snow drifts. That was not the stipulation.
1638600	1642120	Caves. I just want to point out that Lilith said that there's only two guys here.
1642120	1645320	Oh, you son of a bitch.
1648840	1653640	When Tommy meets Marlene, she talks me to join in the fireflies.
1655240	1658600	Same mistake you made. I got groomed. You got groomed.
1659160	1662280	You got up pretty early. If you want to grab more sleep, I'm not even tired.
1662280	1671880	Also from the game. Oh, no, we're entering Chicago.
1674280	1678600	Yeah. Okay. In America, there's highways going around all the major cities, right?
1678600	1682200	You don't have to go to the city. You can just go around it, actually.
1683640	1687880	Actually, why the hell would you go through a city? Other than to cut down time, I'd rather
1687880	1690040	go around it. Yep.
1690040	1695480	Because, Kip, this is where the fucking story happens in this television show that needs
1695480	1701000	conflict. If this was just driving to fucking wherever, pretty boring.
1701000	1703320	What are you talking about? That's a very cozy show.
1703320	1707880	25 hours of driving and Kyle was scratching at the wash. Please give me the faggots back.
1708760	1714920	Well, here's one. I am actually happy for. I like long road trips. Long road trips are fun.
1715800	1720360	So this looks like another level from the game because it has the soda truck in front
1720360	1723080	of the tunnel. So they're doing the same thing again.
1724200	1727880	But this isn't... Joel didn't lose the truck this way.
1730280	1735880	Right. They were ambushed by some group and that's what they call a truck, right?
1735880	1741960	Yeah. So I think this is actually the setup for a level in Salt Lake City near the end
1741960	1744520	of the game. That's what it looks like.
1748280	1750280	Go around it, man. Come on.
1750920	1754920	Screw it. They addressed Kyle's point and defeated it.
1754920	1761880	The answer was, he couldn't be honest. Take the next ramp and we're back on the road
1761880	1766760	many times. Now they are turning.
1767560	1769240	God damn it. Bye. Okay.
1770440	1772280	It's a smart thing to do, though. It's a smart thing to do.
1772280	1773480	I guess I'm right.
1773480	1776280	Yeah, but now you're going to see that it's a bad thing to do because there's going to
1776280	1779320	be like evil shit out there and they're going to have to turn around because that way the
1779320	1780040	plot can happen.
1793800	1795160	Don't you have a compass?
1796840	1798280	Uh, how old is that vehicle?
1801320	1806600	Well, no, I mean as an actual literal compass, you know, come here.
1808600	1810840	Compasses are those things in your smart car, right?
1812360	1814600	Actually, my old Jeep had one.
1814600	1815560	Oh no, this is the scene.
1816280	1817160	Yeah, that's a trap.
1818200	1821640	Okay. Never accept people in the apocalypse.
1826760	1832200	Oh, fuck.
1833160	1834680	See, they're going to come through the city.
1841560	1843320	Okay, so yeah, this is how it happened, yeah.
1846200	1847800	They missed the best one-liner, though.
1847800	1856680	In the game, there was a moment where Ellie asks,
1857400	1861320	aren't you going to help him? And he says, he's not even injured. He just runs him over.
1862680	1864360	He's like, he's injured now, motherfucker.
1864360	1880840	Oh, Arx, just so you know, there was like 50 guys to kill here in the game.
1882040	1883320	Yeah, he murdered like a fuckton.
1883320	1892360	Well, there came number 50.
1903480	1904920	Wow, they've got really good teeth,
1904920	1908840	considering the apocalypse has been going on for a few years.
1908840	1910680	Well, there should be plenty of crests lying around.
1914040	1916200	And toothbrushes.
1916200	1917400	Oh, lots of toothbrushes.
1921240	1922360	Can't aim that low.
1923000	1924200	You just shot Joel.
1924200	1924760	Joel's dead.
1925320	1928760	Yep, that was unfortunate.
1928760	1930760	Oh, well.
1937720	1939480	She couldn't know the bulbs got through things.
1940200	1941000	I'm gonna go home.
1941000	1942040	I'll tell everyone you're good.
1943560	1945640	I don't know what to do.
1945640	1946680	My legs don't work.
1948760	1950040	My mom isn't far.
1950040	1951080	If you can get me to her.
1951720	1952920	You got to kill him, man.
1955640	1957240	We can trade with you guys.
1957240	1958040	We can be friends.
1958040	1958680	I didn't know.
1959640	1960760	I'm Brian.
1960760	1961560	I'm Brian.
1961560	1962120	What's your name?
1962120	1963960	I do appreciate this scene, actually.
1963960	1965880	And this is rather humanizing.
1965880	1966280	Okay.
1966280	1967000	Yeah.
1967000	1969240	Well, also it shows that Ellie's got to like harden up.
1973400	1978760	Remember, nobody's innocent after you shot them.
1980760	1981240	Wait, wait, wait.
1985000	1986760	My dude, you tried to rob us.
1997160	1997720	Damn.
1997720	1998920	Ellie, I got to get in there.
1998920	1999720	I can't get through.
1999720	2001720	That was some harsh shit, but I appreciate it.
2002280	2003000	Yeah.
2003000	2004440	There's some stuff against the door.
2005160	2008440	See, this is also kind of why I understand why people were a bit annoyed by the whole
2008440	2011400	gay romance thing, because it was overly idealized.
2011400	2015480	And it was a happy ending in a universe that doesn't have a whole lot of fucking happy
2015480	2015980	endings.
2017240	2018200	The Bergquists.
2020040	2020540	No.
2021800	2023080	Mark Anthony Halpin.
2024600	2025480	Carrie Schreiber.
2026040	2026840	Haven't seen them.
2027960	2028680	The Chans.
2029880	2030680	Henry Burrell.
2033000	2035400	Okay.
2038840	2040040	You know where Henry is.
2043800	2044280	Lawyer.
2046440	2047480	Medical attention.
2049080	2049880	Family visit.
2051800	2053880	I've completely fallen off the plot now.
2053880	2055000	Who are these people?
2055000	2056200	What has to stop now?
2056440	2062200	Uh, the Kansas City Fedra was overrun by bandits.
2066520	2067240	They've taken over.
2072280	2072760	Jesus.
2079960	2084520	Now, I got to point out, no matter how much of a douchebag that guy might have been, if
2084520	2089320	he's your only trained medical professional, that was a very, very, very bad idea.
2089880	2091000	Yeah, extremely.
2091000	2091240	Yeah.
2091240	2093160	Basically, you definitely have a bad idea.
2093160	2093660	Yep.
2094200	2097160	So she said, find every collaborator and kill them all.
2097160	2103720	So I don't know if they'll get to it, but in the game, the people had overthrown Fedra,
2103720	2107960	like Firefly style, and they immediately devolved into a gang.
2109480	2111880	Because of course they would, after you overthrow the government.
2111880	2113080	There's no utopia here.
2113960	2117720	And then they ended up being worse than Fedra.
2119320	2122520	And yeah, you all know how it goes.
2122520	2124840	Were they cannibals also, or was that a different group?
2125880	2127320	They might have been the cannibals.
2127320	2128200	I don't know.
2128200	2129320	I don't know if cannibals were later.
2130360	2132760	There was just like a hellhole maybe.
2132760	2134760	There was a cannibal group later though, I think.
2134760	2138200	Listen, human flesh with mushrooms built in, pretty convenient.
2140520	2141560	You eat mushrooms?
2143480	2145720	You don't put mushrooms in your pizza?
2146600	2146840	No.
2148440	2150280	Depends on what kind of pizza you're making.
2150280	2151960	You ever had a good Canadian pizza?
2151960	2152760	Bacon and mushrooms?
2153400	2155800	As soon as we don't hear it, we move.
2155800	2156360	No, bacon.
2157080	2157960	Fast as we can.
2159400	2160200	Canadian bacon.
2161160	2161720	We got you.
2161720	2163160	I think neither of you should exist.
2164120	2166680	You need to widen your pallet or widen you.
2168040	2171720	It's not all about post D&D pastries, Arch.
2171720	2172200	Are you okay?
2172840	2177240	His pastry is a sandwich with a piece of meat and cheese in it.
2177240	2181240	First time that you hurt someone like that.
2182760	2186920	See, this is why it's much better to not do this in the video game format too,
2186920	2189560	because here they just kill like three people who attacked them,
2189560	2193560	and it's entirely justifiable for him to still, you know, feel bad about killing people.
2193560	2194680	It's a hard thing.
2194680	2199480	But if he just murdered his way through a hundred fucking dudes, it would feel somewhat hollow.
2199480	2199980	Yep.
2200620	2207980	In the game, I think characters also somewhat acknowledge that Joe's like a mass murdering,
2207980	2211660	like an absolute beast of a man in the background too.
2212300	2213420	Sometimes, yeah.
2213420	2213920	Yeah.
2216780	2219020	Up where they had to tone everything down a bit.
2221420	2225100	I end up a little bit better than the epic storyline.
2230940	2233100	Here, have your little girl pistol back.
2236300	2238460	Did you take out the magazine?
2239020	2239520	No?
2253340	2256140	Ah, the feds didn't know how to handle horror small arms.
2256140	2257420	They truly were the ATF.
2260300	2263020	Safety on trigger discipline.
2263820	2265980	No, you put it in your pack.
2268140	2269180	Shoot your damn ass off.
2277420	2282300	You shoot your damn ass off through your backpack or there's more clutter.
2290860	2293100	Now that means she's going to shoot herself accidentally, I bet.
2293100	2293820	They're going to add that.
2295340	2298060	Or like someone's going to steal it out of her pocket.
2298060	2299100	That's going to come back to bite her.
2299100	2299600	Maybe, yeah.
2304060	2305260	Got mushrooms.
2308540	2309040	Fuck.
2316860	2317900	What did we tell the others?
2320940	2321580	Not yet.
2323020	2325500	Let's just handle what we have to handle.
2325500	2326700	We can deal with this after.
2326700	2327340	Kathleen.
2327340	2327840	After.
2328780	2333340	You have mushroom veins burrowing into your compound.
2333340	2333840	Okay.
2334780	2336140	Like you got to handle that shit now.
2338140	2341100	The personal vendetta thing is going to be the thing that dooms them.
2341660	2342460	Here's a problem.
2342460	2345500	Clearly, you guys know more about what the fuck's happening here than I do.
2345500	2347180	Because I am completely confused.
2347180	2348220	I don't know who this woman is.
2348220	2352380	I don't know why the clearly more senior and experienced man is taking directions from her.
2354620	2356300	I don't understand what the fuck's going on.
2357260	2360620	Like hell, I wouldn't even understand that they'd overrun Fedra unless you told me.
2360620	2365420	I feel like maybe explaining this would have been better use of the previous episode.
2365420	2366460	At least parts of it.
2367100	2367600	Maybe.
2369100	2369980	And I am lost.
2371020	2373100	I can't really remember this story that well.
2373100	2375180	In fact, I don't remember anything up until this point.
2375180	2385500	But like the federal stuff, like you can tell with visual storytelling because you had like federal building walls or blood smeared on the walls charge anymore.
2385500	2388300	Did you kill innocent people?
2391900	2394460	Innocent is a complicated word in the post apocalypse.
2397500	2398000	Joe.
2399340	2399840	What?
2399900	2400620	What are you doing?
2401900	2404220	I don't want someone sneaking up on us while we're sleeping.
2406140	2406640	I get it.
2407100	2407980	Crunch, crunch, crunch.
2408780	2410940	I mean, they can see you from the door.
2410940	2412380	It's a good point.
2412380	2412880	Okay.
2412880	2413580	To shoot you, but.
2413580	2416540	I put the glass outside the door, to be honest.
2418780	2420220	I guess it's a good thought.
2420220	2420860	Don't get me wrong.
2420860	2422300	It's just poorly executed.
2423420	2425500	Side sleeping is the only way to sleep, by the way.
2427580	2429340	When we were talking about hurting people.
2431900	2433500	What did you mean it wasn't your first time?
2435180	2439660	I mean, she tried to gut you with a pocket knife the first time you met her.
2439660	2440700	So talk about it.
2443420	2444700	She goes in a doc.
2444700	2445500	All right.
2445500	2446000	Okay.
2449980	2451740	Enter credit card to proceed.
2452540	2453040	Basically.
2454220	2455900	So it gets easier when you get older.
2459820	2461100	No, not really.
2461900	2462060	Yeah.
2462060	2464940	When you hit a certain age and actually care, turns out to be kind of fun.
2465180	2465680	Yeah.
2467020	2469020	Did you know diarrhea is hereditary?
2470380	2470880	What?
2471580	2472080	Yeah.
2473100	2474460	It runs in your genes.
2480460	2481100	That's great.
2484540	2485740	He thought it was funny too.
2488300	2489500	So goddamn stupid.
2492780	2493980	Jesus, I'm losing it.
2493980	2495500	You're losing it big time.
2498460	2500220	The character bonding.
2500220	2500860	Not too bad.
2501660	2503420	The only person who didn't laugh was Arch.
2503980	2505420	Arch, you hate puns, don't you?
2505420	2506140	He's not a human.
2508460	2508940	I'm sorry.
2508940	2511100	My intelligence is finally fucking high for this.
2512140	2513180	You're more of a lizard.
2513180	2515180	You remind me of that Facebook guy.
2518140	2519260	That Facebook guy.
2520220	2523340	This part is not funny according to the algorithms.
2523980	2535420	I told you they had guns.
2544780	2545500	Well, that's Henry.
2546460	2547740	I think that's Henry and Sam.
2547740	2548240	Yeah.
2548460	2549580	Well, there we go.
2549580	2551260	End of the first episode.
2551260	2552380	Well, no, the fourth episode.
2552380	2553180	The first one tonight.
2554700	2555580	There we go.
2555580	2561020	So yes, I can tell right from the beginning that one of the big problems with this episode
2561020	2565260	is they didn't adequately introduce the antagonist of the next section.
2565260	2568140	They just assume that if you played the game, you'd know who they are.
2568940	2569500	Yep.
2569500	2574140	Which does mean that Arch's point about the previous episode is now validated.
2574140	2578860	Because it would be fine to do that episode as like a bonus, like fluff thing.
2579740	2582700	As long as everything's like adequately explained.
2582700	2587500	But here the antagonist in the relationship is going to be explained in the next episode.
2587500	2591020	But the entire time you're just thinking, what, what, what?
2591020	2593820	Because Arch is like, what the fuck is going on here?
2595180	2599660	Because clearly there's a lot of story or rather who this woman is, why she shot their
2599660	2603980	only motherfucking doctor, why they're running a little Nazi dystopia now.
2604540	2607340	There's a lot that has happened here.
2607340	2611420	And that would probably have been a better use of the previous episode.
2611420	2611900	Yeah.
2612140	2613900	Spend more time building this up than that.
2613900	2617420	I don't know if I necessarily agree.
2617420	2623580	Cause like, I think the show could be going from like Joe and Ellie's perspective, because
2623580	2629580	to them, these are just a bunch of assholes with guns that showed up and they may as well
2629580	2632940	just been bandits and Raiders, which in some ways they are.
2632940	2633900	So that's true.
2633900	2635500	That's actually, that's actually a good point.
2635500	2637740	So I'll tell you how it goes down in the game Arch.
2637740	2638300	Okay.
2638300	2639820	I don't think it was Kansas city.
2639820	2641020	I think it was actually Pittsburgh.
2641020	2642380	It doesn't matter what city it was.
2643580	2645260	They have to go into a city.
2645260	2646860	For some reason, the roads are blocked off.
2646860	2648460	They have to drive through the city.
2648460	2653420	The exact same ambush happens where there's an injured guy, but this time Joel just runs
2653420	2653740	them over.
2653740	2654780	He's like, he's not even injured.
2654780	2655340	He runs them over.
2656460	2658460	They lose Bill's Bill's truck.
2658460	2661580	It crashes into a laundromat, which is what it did in the show.
2662460	2664140	And they have to work through the city on foot.
2664860	2667740	However, the path, because it's, you know, it's a linear video game.
2667740	2671020	The path takes them into the form of the former Fedra camp.
2671580	2677900	The gameplay is you're just killing a shit ton of people, of people just killing a shit
2677900	2679740	ton of basically of bandits.
2679740	2681580	And you can actually like listen to them talk.
2681580	2683980	And if you want to, if you want to get the story, you can listen to them talk about how
2683980	2689500	they, they overthrew Fedra and how they've been like just ambushing people who come,
2689500	2690460	who come through.
2690460	2693740	Sometimes they enslave people who come through a lot of backgrounds.
2693740	2697020	So you also find a data logs in the level because, you know, it's a, it's a video game.
2697020	2699340	So you can just, you can pick these up or you can ignore them.
2699340	2705900	The, the story basically was there was a group in this Fedra quarantine zone that was like
2705900	2708380	the fireflies, but wasn't associated with the fireflies.
2708380	2711100	They were these revolutionaries who wanted to overthrow the government.
2711100	2712620	They managed to do it.
2712620	2713820	They disbanded Fedra.
2713820	2715660	They purged all the people who were loyal to Fedra.
2716860	2721900	There was definitely some, you know, kind of communist rhetoric about what they were
2721900	2725500	doing, but of course they immediately descended into tyranny.
2725820	2729420	And what they do is they go out, they find people who are traveling around, they, they
2729420	2729980	kill them.
2729980	2730860	They take their stuff.
2730860	2733500	If they have kids, they take the kids, they brainwash the kids.
2733500	2737100	They turn them into workers for, for their new civilization.
2737100	2743100	And they're very, they're very utopian and they do not like people leaving even more
2743100	2743660	than Fedra.
2743660	2749660	It's, it's every, like all of Fedra, all of their equipment, worse morals, way more willing
2749660	2752300	to way, way more willingness to be ruthless.
2752860	2757740	Um, just Fedra, but worse and, and, and, and less competent all the way through.
2757740	2758940	But that's, this is the thing.
2758940	2761900	All of this stuff is like, it's all data log stuff.
2761900	2764220	It's all background conversation stuff in the game.
2764220	2766460	You can just fight through it and you don't even have to care about it if you don't want
2766460	2766780	to.
2766780	2767820	But there is a story here.
2768460	2772700	Um, the problem is you can't do data logs in a TV show.
2773820	2778220	So they had to somehow bring it into the show and they didn't do like, they didn't, they
2778220	2783180	did like a, like a 25% job of it because you can see like there's Fedra stuff, but they're
2783180	2784460	clearly not Fedra.
2784460	2787980	So there's like some environmental storytelling happening here, but they needed to do more
2787980	2788220	of it.
2789740	2789980	Yep.
2789980	2794300	Cause environmental only goes so far cause we can, we can easily deduct from the Fedra
2794300	2798140	building with blood smears and there's these like bandits that are occupying now that Fedra
2798140	2799980	has lost control of this region.
2799980	2800300	Yep.
2800300	2804620	Um, but it doesn't really explain like who these people are.
2804620	2807740	Now in the next episode, they're going to probably expand on the whole like Sam thing
2807820	2810540	and the fact that they're leaving, you know, the society and because
2810540	2811740	Don't spoil it, Kibbs.
2812460	2814620	Yeah, but it's game that's been out for a decade.
2814620	2818220	It's not even like, uh, like it's like, who, who is Luke's dad?
2818220	2819580	Like nobody cares anymore.
2819580	2821900	Nor you're spoiling arch for the next episode.
2822540	2823740	Yeah, but here's the problem.
2823740	2827180	This episode didn't give him any context for what the fuck was going on.
2827180	2828220	And that's the problem.
2828220	2834380	If the next episode begins to explain the context and that's, that's fair, but to address
2834380	2838380	the point as well, that is being taken from the perspective of Bill and Joel, that'll
2838380	2838940	be fine.
2838940	2842540	If it weren't for the fact that the preceding episode was not at all taken from the perspective
2842540	2849500	of Bill and Joel, making it a complete break from, oh, you mean Joel and Ellie?
2849500	2851740	People on the television screen.
2851740	2851980	Yes.
2853340	2854540	Cause that's the thing.
2854540	2858460	Like so long as the whole gay romance didn't detract from anything else, I thought it was
2858460	2861900	perfectly fine, but it depends on the next episode.
2861900	2865340	Like if they tell the story of what happened here through these two other characters that
2865340	2867340	just appeared, I'll be more than happy.
2867340	2871420	But if they never explain how the fuck this federal struggle is overrun, I'll be annoyed.
2872300	2872540	Yeah.
2873580	2877980	I thought it was fine to have a self-contained thing for episode three.
2878860	2879980	And it has to be paid off though.
2879980	2881100	So something has to work out.
2881100	2881260	Yeah.
2881260	2883900	Everything else has to work together to do that.
2883900	2884860	Um, yeah.
2884860	2888940	So from, from what I recall, Henry and since we're spoiling it anyway, Henry and Sam in
2888940	2893420	the game wanted to leave the communist utopia and they were very mad about that.
2893420	2898460	And they were sending like, like just guys in trucks, truckloads of guys after them.
2898460	2901340	And, uh, Joel and Ellie just happened to be in the wrong place, wrong time.
2902780	2908380	Well, in this case, from the dialogue, it seems like a Henry got the brother of random
2908380	2909900	woman killed.
2909900	2915100	Uh, maybe it seemed like when the, cause they were in target in the doctor and he was like,
2915100	2918220	I didn't give them your brother's like, yes, but Henry did.
2918220	2919660	You gave them Henry, I guess.
2922700	2925020	Yeah, they're, they're implying that there.
2927020	2929820	So there's, there seems to be more motivation.
2930540	2931020	Yep.
2931020	2932860	We'll have to see personal vendetta too.
2933580	2934460	Yeah, we'll have to see.
2935580	2936780	So let's start up episode five.
2936780	2937660	I've got it queued up.
2938700	2940060	That's uh, that's roll.
2941900	2943740	So while this is playing, I'm just looking this up.
2945100	2948060	Twitter's actually gone kind of quiet on this show.
2949020	2950540	I don't know if that's good or bad.
2950540	2952940	I mean, there's no big controversy surrounding it anymore.
2952940	2957260	And this, you know, we're not counting Ben Shapiro's that was kind of nutsoid, but like
2957260	2961580	the normies just seemed to be watching and enjoying the show, but not really talking
2961580	2962220	about it.
2962220	2963340	I don't know how to take that.
2964220	2968780	Well, it's probably because the show is it's entertaining, but beyond that, I wouldn't
2968780	2970140	say it's like stellar.
2970140	2970780	It's just all right.
2971580	2973420	Nothing particularly special.
2973420	2977500	And it's not really pushing any particular point either, I guess.
2987820	2989980	Oh, it's just going to be, it's going to be the backstory, isn't it?
2989980	2993100	Of how they liberated, liberated the zone from the bedroom.
2993100	3001180	It's a little bit of a waste.
3002060	3005420	Yeah, the people's revolution.
3009420	3010860	We all own the means of production.
3011820	3012380	Oh yeah.
3012380	3015100	These, uh, these definitely do look like heroes of justice.
3015100	3015580	That's for sure.
3016300	3018220	They're just killing the kulaks arch.
3018220	3019020	They deserved it.
3023100	3026460	Yeah, this is the problem with the revolution.
3026460	3027980	It's just going to make you the monsters.
3034300	3036860	I know you hang that person over a bonfire.
3036860	3037740	I don't believe you.
3041260	3043660	You will not really revolution it.
3043660	3046620	Yeah, like that's a great image of a fair trial.
3046620	3046780	Right?
3046780	3047340	Fuck him there.
3047340	3049260	Like I'd hand myself in in a heartbeat.
3049260	3049740	No doubt.
3050060	3054460	Wait, was the kid deaf in the last or mute in the, in the game?
3054460	3055180	I don't think he was.
3057020	3057740	I don't remember.
3058780	3059740	Did it feel good?
3061180	3063020	Betraying your neighbors to Fedra?
3064460	3065420	The struggle session.
3066860	3068140	Well, I'm not Fedra.
3068780	3069500	Lucky for you.
3070780	3072460	No one here has to die.
3073900	3076060	Yeah, we could put you on trial.
3076060	3076780	You're all guilty.
3076780	3078300	So that's how that'll go.
3078300	3079500	And you'll do some time.
3079500	3081820	Oh yeah, that's much better.
3081820	3086380	He had a place to hole up in the open city in case things went bad.
3088460	3089980	But things have gone great.
3090620	3093740	Haven't you heard Kansas city is free.
3097820	3099420	I do quite like this.
3099420	3102940	This is a very subversive take on communism.
3102940	3105420	I told you everything I know.
3105420	3108380	No, we are not really putting them on trial.
3109180	3111020	When you're done, burn the bodies.
3111020	3111740	It's faster.
3114380	3115980	Man, freedom.
3120460	3121420	People's Republic.
3123340	3127820	I've been saying like every great writer of history says one thing correct.
3127820	3131580	Even the people who are the worst like Marx or whoever I've been reading mold bug.
3131580	3134380	He has said one thing that I like only one thing.
3134380	3137900	And that one thing is sometimes freedom requires order.
3138540	3140540	And it can't just be anarchy.
3140540	3145900	You know, freedom from all possible institutions and just pure anarchy is no real freedom.
3147100	3148220	I agree with that.
3148220	3151100	That's why I'm a libertarian and not an uncap.
3152780	3158220	Like we need some form of order to ensure freedom for people.
3158940	3162940	Otherwise, it's just like warlords and well,
3163900	3164220	roaming.
3164220	3165660	Yes, it's just fucking this.
3166380	3168060	Yeah, or it's just fucking this.
3168060	3170060	He's scared because you're scared.
3176780	3179740	No, I'm pretty sure he's scared because he's Anne Frank now.
3179740	3180620	I'd be scared too.
3184540	3184940	Hello.
3188220	3195580	Well, he's deaf now.
3196300	3196800	Yep.
3201020	3201660	Look at me.
3201660	3202860	I am the captain now.
3207260	3209180	No, communists are still shooting people.
3218220	3231580	Okay, back to painting.
3243420	3245900	I always tell them not to whack on things.
3245900	3248060	Yeah, you could always eat the paint.
3249180	3249820	Oh, God.
3251900	3253100	All the crayon tasting.
3257500	3259660	You should probably go in the night, though, shouldn't you?
3259660	3260380	I don't know.
3260380	3262620	Communists are creatures of the dark, after all.
3262620	3263500	They might see better.
3264940	3267100	Like way skittered around the ceiling.
3269420	3270380	The suction cups.
3272220	3273020	Kibs, you're beeping.
3273020	3273660	What's going on?
3274620	3275980	What do you mean beeping?
3275980	3278060	I heard a beep in the background of your.
3278780	3279740	Oh, don't mind that.
3280300	3282860	It's your microwave from making those hot pockets.
3287740	3288940	Get it right in his eyes.
3288940	3289980	Make him blind, too.
3291980	3296860	Yeah, I'm not sure if smearing paint over your face is actually that intelligent.
3298220	3299660	I mean, it doesn't really do anything.
3300940	3302300	That depends on the paint, Kyle.
3302300	3304220	Have you gotten paint in your eyes?
3304220	3306300	Lead paint acrylic.
3306300	3308140	It's not fucking lead.
3308700	3310860	I think you let this kid play with lead paint.
3310860	3312140	Are you retarded?
3312140	3313260	It's the apocalypse.
3313260	3314300	Who cares?
3314300	3316380	It's acrylic paint.
3316380	3321900	Oh, also, I mean, not to get racist here or anything, but I mean,
3322940	3327180	they clearly are able to, like, stealth around at night easier because they're darker skinned.
3327900	3328540	Oh, my God.
3328540	3329340	I can't believe you went there.
3329340	3332460	Ah, good point.
3332460	3336780	Well, no, seriously, though, like, you're going to blend in in the night better,
3336780	3338140	just practically speaking.
3339020	3339740	That's true.
3339740	3342860	My grand puppet always told me the tale of the first black person he saw.
3342860	3345580	It was just a raincoat in the middle of night walking towards him.
3345580	3347180	An empty rimmed raincoat.
3347820	3348940	He was so confused.
3348940	3350540	Wait, is that a real story?
3351100	3352460	Oh, yeah, that was an actual story.
3352460	3354140	It scared the shit out of my granddad.
3356940	3357740	A ghost.
3357740	3358700	Oh, it's a black man.
3359340	3361980	Oh, they watched the whole Joel Ellie thing go down.
3366300	3367740	Damn, he dropping them niggas.
3368700	3369200	Yeah.
3373180	3374620	Time to use us to your advantage.
3375500	3377580	And to be fair, Dev, this isn't that racist.
3377580	3379900	I mean, the black father has yes to abandon his child.
3381020	3381520	Yep.
3382300	3383180	Where's the mother?
3384460	3385340	Well, good point.
3385340	3386620	I think they're brothers, though.
3387100	3387820	I think they're brothers.
3388860	3390380	So where's the mom, then, and dad?
3391020	3393980	Yeah, dad, you're digging yourself deeper down the hole.
3395420	3398220	They were probably like, fed restuges or something.
3398220	3400140	So they were counter-revolutionaries.
3400140	3400640	Yeah.
3401340	3401840	Damn.
3402220	3405420	Well, at least the parents had a good reason to run out on them this time, then.
3405420	3409180	See, he did put some outside the door, Kyle, you dumbass.
3410620	3412140	That was you who said that.
3412140	3413020	No, I didn't.
3413020	3414060	Hey, that gun's empty.
3414780	3416540	Oh, my God, child.
3416540	3417900	Yeah, that gun is empty.
3418620	3419900	That was interesting.
3419900	3421260	They still didn't explain enough, though.
3422060	3423660	You don't have to worry about what to say.
3423660	3426620	It was better than nothing, but I would have liked a lot more than that.
3426620	3427500	I want to help you.
3427500	3429180	I don't know what the next step is with something like this.
3429820	3432060	If I lower my gun, we didn't hurt you.
3433180	3435180	So you don't hurt us, right?
3437580	3438140	That's right.
3439500	3441340	Oh, Joel's gonna do it anyway.
3441340	3442220	That's just the way he sounds.
3442220	3443260	He has an asshole voice.
3443340	3444220	Joel, tell him he's okay.
3446540	3448620	Everything is great, dude.
3448620	3449120	Fuck.
3452460	3454220	Oh, Joel didn't just kill them.
3458060	3459500	Did he do that in the game?
3459500	3460140	Did you get these?
3460700	3463020	No, but how old is he?
3468380	3468880	He's eight.
3469820	3470320	Cool.
3471120	3472000	You didn't ask him.
3472000	3473360	You forgot your brother's age.
3476400	3477760	He was 14 in the game.
3478640	3479920	He was 14 before.
3480640	3484560	There is, like, an Elie quasi-romance, slightly.
3484560	3486240	To get a view of the city and plan a way out.
3487600	3490640	And when the sun's up, I'll show you one.
3494640	3497760	It would be like traveling during the broad daylight, you see.
3497760	3499680	It's more challenging that way.
3500800	3502640	It does feel like not a good idea.
3505200	3505760	Oh, here we go.
3505760	3506480	There's some backstory.
3506480	3508640	Finally tortured and murdered people for 20 years.
3509520	3510960	You know what happens when you do that to people?
3512160	3513600	They become communists.
3513600	3514800	They do it right back to you.
3514800	3516320	That's how it follows you here.
3516320	3518720	I know the city, and that's how I'm going to help you get out.
3519280	3521600	Also, that city looks very functional, you know?
3522640	3523920	They clearly, like, have...
3524480	3528000	They were in a real skylight or whatever,
3528000	3531040	looking down on the real city that was not apocalyptic.
3531760	3532800	And they just played it off.
3546400	3547680	Besides the communist rebels?
3558000	3558960	Fascist motherfuckers.
3559840	3560880	Fucking fuck.
3560880	3563280	They're going to help us escape.
3567840	3568340	Right?
3571680	3572320	All right.
3572320	3573920	You'll enlighten your child, would you?
3576640	3579280	Okay, the more they do this, the more I'm on their side.
3579280	3583120	It's fucking annoying seeing these retards walking around in broad daylight.
3583120	3584240	Yeah, I'd do this at night.
3586240	3587280	We need to get out of sight.
3588560	3590720	I think it's this way.
3592160	3594320	Then again, I suppose it's better than House of Dragons,
3594320	3599440	where they shot scenes in broad daylight and then dipped them in editing to be dark.
3600000	3600960	That's pretty bad, yeah.
3601520	3603280	Would you like to watch a television show?
3603280	3605040	Yes, well, fuck you.
3605040	3606800	It's actually a audiobook.
3613520	3615280	I thought I told you put that in your rucksack.
3615280	3618560	It was never paid off.
3633840	3637040	Yeah, also if there's clickers, like, don't make any noise, dude.
3638720	3639220	Fuck.
3641760	3644080	I mean, he knows what they are, so he knows that they...
3644960	3646080	they operate on sound.
3646080	3646960	Like, shut the fuck up.
3651600	3654960	To be fair, they're walking down a lengthy concrete corridor.
3655840	3658720	If there was a clicker down there, he'd hear them from hundreds of meters.
3659360	3660880	Yeah, waddling towards them already.
3661520	3663680	Yep, because of the way the sound reverberates.
3663680	3671280	Whoa.
3675120	3676640	Somebody used up a lot of crayons.
3693680	3696320	Vaults.
3716000	3717440	Oh, now you noticed.
3718960	3719760	You fucking...
3719760	3725520	Well, I guess we can wait tonight, this time.
3726160	3731120	You know, I wasn't exactly telling you the truth before.
3733200	3734240	About me not killing someone.
3737280	3739120	There was a man, a great man.
3741120	3746560	He was never afraid, never selfish, and he was always forgiving.
3750400	3751520	Have you ever met someone like that?
3752400	3753760	The kind of man you'd follow anywhere.
3756000	3759280	I mean, I wanted to, but I would have.
3762560	3767680	Yeah, but Sam, he got sick.
3770080	3770720	Leukemia.
3775200	3778800	Yeah, anyway, there was one drug that worked.
3779760	3782320	And, whoa, big shock.
3783360	3786080	There wasn't much left of it, and it belonged to Fedra.
3787360	3790640	And if I wanted something, I was gonna take something big.
3793120	3794240	So I gave him something big.
3796480	3797360	That one great man.
3800560	3802880	The leader of the resistance movement in Kansas City.
3807120	3808000	A Catholic brother.
3809760	3813280	Was that in the game?
3818640	3822080	I'm trying to justify the communist revolution a bit more.
3822080	3826320	Yeah, I think in the game, they were just going after them for leaving.
3839760	3842960	But being a woman, I was genetically incapable for that.
3846480	3848800	Where's the justice in that?
3848800	3850800	What is the point of that?
3853840	3854960	I think it went over her head.
3854960	3855760	He was a great man.
3856480	3863040	We all loved him, but he didn't change anything.
3863760	3866400	Oh, my God, she's Benito Mussolini.
3866400	3868400	She was the one who finally brought the revolution.
3870160	3871040	We're with you.
3871040	3875920	This is Sargon's capital punishment arc right here.
3876720	3878240	Why should we forgive them?
3878240	3878880	Kill them all.
3880320	3882160	This is how you do a night scene.
3882160	3886080	You illuminate it fully, and then you just have some darkness in the background.
3886080	3887040	I can see things.
3888720	3890800	I feel like it can't be quite this easy.
3893200	3895280	Yeah, it wasn't in the game either.
3895920	3897040	There's gonna be something, I'm sure.
3899760	3903520	He's like, no, Ellie, never, ever, ever happening.
3904080	3907840	And then I'm like, I'm going to ask you a million more times.
3907840	3917360	And he's like, oh, recognize the house?
3919920	3921120	This is the sniper house.
3924480	3927200	Okay, so there's like an infamously hard level in the game.
3929760	3934080	Where basically you have to go up a straight long street with like a
3935840	3938480	very accurate sniper killing you the entire way.
3939600	3943920	There's a lot of stealthing and a lot of trying over and over and over again.
3944880	3947520	Luckily, this guy isn't a particularly good sniper.
3947520	3950480	If you don't move, he's not going to hit you.
3950480	3954240	I'm going to go around, try to get in the house through the back, and then I'll take about.
3954240	3955760	But if you go out there, he's going to kill you.
3955760	3957120	It's dark, and he has shit aim.
3957120	3958000	Nobody's going to kill me.
3958000	3958800	Then he's going to kill us.
3963200	3966480	Yeah, no, if this guy could aim this, I wouldn't be this much of a problem.
3966480	3968720	Yeah, Cib Zloth, you recognize it?
3969840	3970340	Yep.
3970340	3978500	Man, that poor guy.
3980660	3983700	Like, he's practically blind at this point.
3983700	3987700	He's just pulling the trigger, hoping it'll scare them off.
3987700	3989860	Please don't come over here.
3989860	3990820	These are warning shots.
3990820	3991780	I just don't want to hurt you.
3995140	3996340	Was the mission at night?
3997140	3998260	No, it was during the day.
3998260	3999220	That'll bring the day.
4005860	4008660	Maybe your sniper's better in the game because it was daytime.
4016980	4018980	And this is where you unlock the sniper rifle.
4018980	4023700	Oh, no.
4023700	4027780	It was supposed to be the silly sight set, except worse.
4040500	4041000	Jesus.
4045620	4047220	Joel's also a terrible shot.
4048980	4053940	I think the rifle has been maintained or something, because this is awful.
4054500	4055780	The scope is fucked.
4055780	4056820	It just jammed.
4060100	4061700	That's just a shit rifle.
4079940	4081700	There you go.
4089060	4090820	That's an awful lot of brown shirts.
4092580	4093080	Whoa.
4095860	4097060	He's just a fucking kid.
4099220	4100740	Well, kids die, Henry.
4101460	4103300	They die all the time.
4103300	4107220	You think the whole world revolves around him?
4107940	4111140	That he's worth everything?
4112660	4116260	Well, this is what happens when you fuck with fate.
4120260	4121060	Get ready to take him.
4121060	4122660	He's actually a fairly compelling villain.
4122660	4123160	Yes.
4123700	4124900	I don't know about that.
4124900	4126820	The thing is, she sounds like she could be,
4126820	4128900	but all of this is based on nothing but,
4128900	4131780	oh, there used to be a guy and he was totally chill,
4131780	4133220	and so now she's Hitler.
4134100	4135540	You didn't show that, I think.
4135540	4136420	He was the...
4136420	4140020	I think what they're doing is he was supposed to be the good guy,
4140020	4147700	but he was also not a radical, but she's the radical and she's horrible,
4147700	4148740	but she also caused...
4149380	4153140	Was the able to introduce change.
4154020	4155460	Yeah, she was Mussolini.
4155460	4156580	It was bad change.
4157220	4158020	Changes are good.
4158820	4162020	But this thing like that needed way more cooking,
4162020	4163620	because right now it's so cliche.
4163620	4166740	They're trying so hard to make her the complex villain,
4166740	4170660	but the only reason I have to sympathize for this chick
4170660	4173780	is that she totally had a brother who was a totally good guy,
4173780	4174660	or so I've been told.
4177380	4179380	And she's totally doing this for the right reasons,
4179380	4181380	or so I've been told, because feta were bad,
4181380	4182580	or so I've been told.
4183220	4186500	But we're also sure she's bad though.
4186500	4187620	Yeah, she's bad.
4187620	4188500	Hold on, something's going.
4188500	4191700	Oh, that's going to be the zombies.
4194100	4194500	Noise.
4196260	4197780	Here comes the zombie cavalry.
4203220	4204100	Oh my God.
4204100	4217460	Yeah, it's time to fucking run.
4217460	4219460	Just just no, don't don't huddle that run.
4224660	4225300	Guys, what the fuck?
4226900	4228020	No, don't save them.
4228020	4228500	Kill them.
4228500	4237060	No, I want them to kill the bad people with the guns
4237060	4238980	that are a far larger threat to the children.
4248580	4250340	God, it's a super zombie.
4251220	4252660	Oh my God, what's that thing?
4253620	4255540	Yeah, these things are fucking nasty.
4256100	4258900	Oh, I didn't think they were going to have bloaters in this,
4258900	4260100	because they're so ridiculous.
4261220	4262740	They're bullshit.
4262740	4263700	They're bullspongy.
4265860	4267780	Well, this one does appear to be bullspongy.
4270820	4272020	They're going to get their muppets.
4272660	4272980	Yep.
4285540	4292340	God, I feel like these villains are so undercooked.
4293540	4295380	He killed, they killed Santa Claus,
4295380	4296660	and that's all I know about him now.
4301620	4302820	It's a little kid zombie.
4304020	4304900	That's pretty fucked up.
4305460	4306580	It's a kid clicker.
4310900	4311700	Just shoot it.
4313220	4314020	She's out of ammo.
4315780	4316980	She can leave her load.
4317940	4320660	Did she not have one fucking magazine?
4320660	4323380	No, if the show was brave, they'd kill the child zombie.
4332500	4334500	Luckily, Joe became a much better sniper.
4335060	4337780	Yeah, I mean, the area's illuminated at least.
4339380	4341300	Well, he was shooting against the giant truck,
4341300	4342500	and he was headlights on it.
4342500	4343380	It was pretty illuminated.
4345780	4347380	He never shot his headlight in here.
4348260	4348900	Yeah, it was heavy.
4352180	4353380	Underneath the headlights.
4359300	4361380	God does not understand how life works.
4375780	4387380	All right.
4392580	4393540	I think they lost.
4394260	4397380	Yeah, I think it's over for Kansas City.
4397380	4398020	That's it.
4398020	4398740	The city's gone.
4399540	4400580	They deserve that.
4400580	4402100	That's what they get for being communists.
4403060	4406500	That's true, but man, I wish that was more of a proper downfall.
4407540	4409700	Yeah, that needed like another whole episode to cook.
4409700	4413460	I think I have a whole but at least 10-20 minutes.
4415620	4416500	You think they'll be okay?
4417940	4418580	Yeah, I think.
4421780	4422340	It's easier.
4422340	4425220	Oh, yeah, they've seen plenty of death and destruction in their lives.
4425220	4425940	We'll be fine.
4425940	4432420	It just falls asleep.
4435380	4436580	So there's one thing I noticed.
4437460	4440500	These characters, Henry and Sam, they are black in the original game.
4441860	4447620	And Hollywood's never going to race swap a black character to be white in the adaptation, are they?
4448820	4449940	Not in the current year.
4451940	4453380	Given it a few decades.
4453380	4455460	It always goes one way with that shit.
4456740	4457300	Of course.
4459860	4462820	Martin Luther King is Ryan Reynolds.
4470580	4471300	Oh, no.
4473060	4475140	Well, time to put them down.
4484100	4485540	Oh, don't give him false hope.
4485940	4488580	Yeah, don't come on.
4488580	4492500	It's nicer than just take him out back and putting two fucking barrels in him.
4500340	4502100	Usually like a fucking blood transfusion.
4508660	4510740	Yeah, no kid is going to be able to do that.
4512820	4513860	I don't think this is going to work.
4514820	4516020	I don't think it's going to work, Ellie.
4519220	4520820	Just squish your blood right in there.
4520820	4521700	That'll work, won't it?
4526740	4527220	Don't worry.
4527220	4529540	It's the cold thing is that she's trying.
4533620	4535060	Just magically heals up.
4535060	4535460	Zoop.
4542500	4544420	He's like, you're retarded.
4548660	4549700	Just shoot me.
4552740	4553940	That kid's dead.
4553940	4554660	He's fucked.
4555540	4556040	Yep.
4557140	4558100	Oh, very touching.
4558100	4561300	My character I've known for all of 30, 40 minutes.
4562260	4564980	Like, she would have tied him to the fucking bed or something.
4564980	4565780	Yeah, he's fucked.
4567220	4568580	Oh, I remember this part of the game.
4569780	4571220	It didn't happen in a motel, though.
4572420	4573620	It happened like in a high rise.
4581460	4583300	The worst part is he can feel that.
4591300	4599300	It happened exactly like that in the game.
4599300	4599800	Yeah.
4608580	4609460	Oh, OK.
4609460	4612180	Well, I guess I was getting sick of these sidecarriages anyways.
4614180	4615620	I mean, that is how their story ended.
4617060	4618420	Different location, but same way.
4618420	4622100	Oh, God, no spicy joke.
4622100	4622980	Too spicy joke.
4622980	4623620	Keep it down.
4623620	4624260	No, say it.
4624260	4624820	Say it.
4624820	4625320	Do it.
4626660	4628260	Arch, Arch, do it.
4628260	4631220	Every time there's black characters, Arch has to make racist jokes.
4631220	4631780	Do it, Arch.
4632580	4634100	Because it's funny.
4634100	4635780	Arch, it's on my channel.
4635780	4636180	It's OK.
4636180	4636660	Go ahead.
4639780	4643220	That was the first time in a while I actually caught myself and was like,
4643220	4644340	no, that's a bit too much.
4646180	4647620	No, Arch, you have to.
4647620	4650660	If I tell us what I will truly be canceled.
4650660	4652340	Joel's been humanized again.
4652340	4652900	My God.
4657700	4661220	Ellie is reawakening that human human inside of him.
4668340	4669940	He's at least taken his jacket.
4669940	4671060	Looks like a warm jacket.
4678340	4682420	There we go.
4685700	4690420	All right, so right off the bat, I am sounding a bit to the Bill and Frank
4690420	4696580	romance now because that story felt more important and larger and undercooked.
4697700	4698200	Yep.
4698660	4705460	Especially also to us, like every fucking person in this universe has a horrible ending.
4705460	4708260	Everyone, everyone they come over has a sad story.
4708260	4714900	Every one of them gets fucking nuked, except for Bill and Frank, who lives a perfect happy
4714900	4719380	days drinking wine as their mechanical generator lasts for 20 years.
4720420	4721140	Yeah.
4721140	4725780	So you have to remember Bill was a prepper, so.
4727780	4728900	He was ready.
4728900	4730820	I think it takes you so far, though.
4730820	4731380	Absolutely.
4731380	4736420	But the thing is, like a mechanical generator is going to run you five, ten years if you've
4736420	4737940	got a good one, that fucking thing.
4737940	4740580	And that was a massive industrial aggregate, too.
4740580	4740820	Yep.
4740820	4742980	It ran without a hitch for 20 years.
4744980	4749300	So, I mean, you probably traded with Joel and fixed it up.
4750020	4750340	Yeah.
4750340	4752180	And fixed shut up during the years.
4753300	4755540	Joel did mention, like, trading for machine parts.
4756420	4760980	It can be assumed that this was a part of that, because you don't need to explain everything
4760980	4761540	in a show.
4761540	4763620	Nobody cares about it.
4763620	4765220	It's not that it's explaining anything.
4765220	4767860	It's that you have two characters who live a perfectly happy life.
4767860	4768980	Everything is abundance.
4768980	4770020	The fuel is still running.
4770020	4772180	They've got they don't just have food.
4772180	4776740	They have fresh lamb chops with wine and strawberries.
4777300	4777540	Yeah.
4777540	4778820	And strawberries.
4778820	4781780	If I could have had the grew those, that's less ridiculous.
4782420	4783140	So here's the thing.
4783140	4787940	Meanwhile, everyone else is living in squalor and dirt and they're filthy and they get to
4787940	4790420	live for about 10 minutes per episode.
4790420	4791220	Yep.
4791220	4792900	So, Arch, here's the situation.
4792900	4793460	Okay.
4793460	4796660	The Last of Us is well, it's a travel story, right?
4796660	4801380	So they can't stick around in one town for too long to really see the rise and fall of,
4801380	4805620	like, a big political faction because they spend the entire game on the road.
4806500	4809780	And so you have to, like, get the backstory through through logs and stuff.
4809780	4811540	Doesn't translate over to a TV.
4811540	4819300	However, every single person that Joel and Ellie come across meet a horrific death in
4819300	4820020	the game.
4820020	4824260	That's why, you know, Frank kills himself and Bill is bitter and alone.
4824260	4824900	Except for Bill.
4825780	4827380	Yeah, but Bill goes off.
4827380	4829700	Bill needs a pretty fucking horrific end, too.
4829700	4833060	And then his life companion fucking hangs himself.
4833060	4837300	Every person that you meet and while going through the game, The Last of Us, they all
4837300	4839940	meet, like, a terrible end of some type.
4839940	4841540	It's always a terrible end.
4841540	4843620	And that's kind of the point is, like, Joel.
4844660	4847460	I mean, I'll spoil a little bit more for you, Arch, if you don't mind.
4848100	4854900	Joel's actions as you go through the game become increasingly violent and erratic in
4854900	4860340	the service of keeping Ellie alive to the point that, like, every single wander they
4860340	4863620	come across just, like, meets a terrible, meets a terrible fate.
4863620	4866500	That's the point of the show is, like, how far Joel is willing to go for this girl.
4867620	4868980	And so you can make a story out of that.
4868980	4869780	Fair enough.
4869780	4875940	And you are kind of correct in that whole thing.
4875940	4880820	If they're going to do that story, they kind of ruined it by giving the gay couple a happy
4880820	4881300	ending.
4881300	4882820	I wouldn't go so far as to say ruined.
4882820	4890180	It just feels more unfitting after seeing this.
4890180	4895860	Like, it fits worse because if they have an entire episode to dedicate to that, then this
4895860	4898580	was a larger and more important set of events.
4899220	4901620	Well, there are two episodes for this one.
4901620	4908260	And so far, I don't think they've ever really dedicated more than one episode on any sort
4908260	4909540	of given topic.
4909540	4910660	Because that's true.
4910660	4910900	Yeah.
4911940	4914580	Episode one is the establishment thing.
4915300	4920980	And episode two was the start of the journey and also Tess's death.
4921860	4931300	And episode three was about Bill and Frank, and episode four and five are with this new
4931300	4931700	group.
4931700	4936420	So they've actually had two episodes dedicated to this particular group.
4936420	4943940	And I think for what they showed, and for the pacing and overall taking in the overall
4943940	4948420	broader pacing, I think they did fine with what they got.
4948420	4955220	I think since everything else only had one episode and this one had two, I feel like
4955220	4962260	doing three on this one would have stretched this beyond just a stop gap and made it into
4962260	4963620	an entire arc.
4963620	4965540	And this was sort of like a mini-arc.
4966500	4969060	And I think for what it is, it's fine.
4969060	4978100	But if you were more used to, say, The Walking Dead, the pacing from that, if this were
4978100	4981300	Walking Dead, they would dedicate an entire season on this.
4982020	4985060	Because Walking Dead numerously did that.
4986180	4996820	When they would encounter a new group of people that will try to kill a main group, they'll
4996820	5004260	usually have an interesting or overarching villain as the leader.
5004340	5011300	And they'll have several episodes dedicated towards learning the backstory and what came
5011300	5016180	of the group that they are now in opposition to the main group.
5017060	5025460	And I feel like if you're used to that, then you could take a look at this and be like,
5025460	5027460	oh, well, they didn't spend enough time on it.
5027460	5034500	And yeah, it would be nice to spend more time with learning about that stuff.
5034500	5039620	But I don't think it would fit this pacing of the skill that they're going with and the
5039620	5045220	theme of just moving from one direction to another, because it's all about transporting
5045220	5046340	Ellie throughout.
5046340	5050900	Well, that's kind of the point, because all of the other episodes have been about Joel
5050900	5052020	and Ellie.
5052020	5056500	And then you have one episode which has nothing to do with them, which is a complete sidetrack,
5057460	5062420	and then they don't do that for this group, which is this is a more important story element
5062420	5067460	in their journey, which means the Bill and Frank episode feels way more out of place.
5067460	5072020	It feels like it was put in there and it doesn't fit in with the rest of the show.
5072020	5076980	If they had done more on this group, too, I would have been like, OK, they're clearly
5076980	5083060	going for more of a grand scenery surrounding them rather than just the traveler story.
5083060	5088500	Instead, you have the travel story that stops for one episode and then resumes after that
5088500	5091460	again, because I absolutely understand that none of the characters get to live, because
5091460	5093140	as you said, it's the traveler story.
5093140	5097140	And so annoying side characters need to be shooed out of the way one way or another.
5098100	5100420	Well, I think I know I think I know what you're saying.
5100420	5105940	It's something like it's something like you can have a story where you're going from place
5105940	5108900	to place rapidly and you don't get everything.
5108980	5113300	And the and the villains of the day kind of have to be handled in that episode or soon
5113300	5120340	after, or you can have a story where like every time Joel bumps into a new group, we
5120340	5125060	get like an entire flashback build up of what they went through.
5125060	5131300	So in that in that in that type of story, each episode or like maybe each arc of the
5131300	5137380	show, it it becomes like Joel's journey becomes like a frame story with all these other
5138020	5140180	stories happening inside of the frame.
5140180	5142820	You could do that, but but you can't do both of them.
5142820	5149060	You can't have one episode focus exclusively on Bill and Frank and then not give the next
5149060	5151460	group just as much focus, which they didn't.
5152900	5154980	And I think I think that's what we're going to do.
5154980	5156180	Yes, that's that's my point.
5157140	5160980	So I decided to look this up real quick just just to get some numbers behind this.
5160980	5165540	So I looked at the Last of Us season one critical reception by episode on Rotten Tomatoes.
5166180	5169780	So all the episodes are still considered good, by the way.
5169780	5173700	But episode one has critical reception 100 percent.
5174580	5180980	It is like 97 percent per episode to 98 percent for episode three, 100 percent for episode
5180980	5184420	four and 90 percent for episode five.
5184420	5190340	So people still overwhelmingly loved this, but it dropped down 10 percentage points episode
5190340	5191460	five compared to the other four.
5192260	5196660	And I think that's because that final villain at the end there, the woman just didn't have
5196660	5201700	enough time to like really get established and like there's only a couple of establishing
5201700	5202260	scenes with her.
5202260	5206180	There was the scene where she's talking to the doctor and then there's the scene where
5206180	5209940	she's in her childhood, her childhood bedroom.
5209940	5215140	And those are the only real character focused scenes on her to make her a compelling villain
5215140	5215780	for the audience.
5215780	5216900	And it just didn't work.
5216900	5221380	There wasn't the one thing the one thing we can definitely see here is the translation
5221460	5225780	from video game media, interactive media to TV show.
5225780	5229300	And this is where the video games able to do it better because better use of pacing,
5229300	5232420	better use of exploration and visual storytelling through exploration.
5233460	5236420	The show has no such luxuries to do these things.
5236420	5240180	You can't overhear dialogue as they sneak through because they can only do like maybe
5240180	5243460	a sneak thing for like one or one section of the show.
5243460	5244820	And it wouldn't be very good at that.
5245460	5249780	So you can see that the story doesn't translate very well.
5250740	5254100	And especially when they're trying to somewhat remain faithful to it.
5254100	5258180	So that's going to become a bigger issue, I think, as we get further and further into
5258180	5258580	the show.
5258580	5265140	I don't know if it's that because it's not that this story can't translate.
5265140	5267460	It's that they didn't give it enough time to translate.
5267460	5273780	Well, certain sections will not translate without them completely reframing and reworking
5273780	5274260	things.
5274260	5278500	They've already reworked quite a bit because of the whole like seeing like the bad guy
5278500	5279540	perspective thing.
5279540	5280500	That's completely new.
5281780	5286260	Like you don't really see them a lot because, you know, you're following this perspective.
5286260	5290180	Of course, but that's them simulating the audio logs, essentially.
5290180	5291940	That's the bad guy perspective.
5291940	5292820	That's the audio logs.
5292820	5294020	That's the bad guy perspective.
5296020	5299300	But the audio logs leave a little bit more vague, especially when they actually talk
5299300	5301460	about the bad guys and all the things they're doing.
5301460	5305460	And it's not more so like, I don't know.
5305460	5310900	It's hard to describe because if you play the game, it was just you escaping with Harry
5310900	5311780	and Sam, right?
5312340	5312580	Yeah.
5313220	5313380	Yeah.
5314260	5320260	There's no particular like I think that woman was mostly like a background character, I
5320260	5320740	think.
5320740	5321240	Yeah.
5322100	5324100	Written for like the movie.
5324100	5326740	I mean, the show was big.
5326740	5329940	Yeah, she was like only mention logs, I think, actually in the game.
5330660	5334340	They expanded it out a bit, but they didn't do anything with the expansion like in the
5336100	5339060	you stealth and fight your way through the city in the game.
5339060	5340980	And then you make it to like Sniper's Alley.
5340980	5343060	Then you get out of Sniper's Alley, you just move on.
5343060	5346100	I don't even think there was like a big rush of infected at that point.
5346100	5350180	I think that was in our episode on this group.
5350180	5352100	They completely reworked that whole section.
5352100	5354020	That was not faithful to the game at all.
5354020	5355380	Oh, speaking of that.
5355380	5356100	Okay.
5356100	5358420	What did you think of the first appearance of the bloater?
5360340	5362020	A stupid video game monster.
5363140	5363700	Yeah, kind of.
5365780	5369220	It's not as cool because what it should have been as the bloater should be fighting like
5369220	5370020	Joel and Ellie.
5370020	5371940	And it could be like a really tense moment.
5373700	5378820	Like, I don't know, the bloater has always been scarier in the game because when it attacked
5378820	5381380	you, you're like, fuck, not that piece of shit again.
5382180	5384340	Like he eats bullets like nobody's business.
5384340	5389140	And he's really just kind of cancerous to deal with because he murders you pretty easily.
5390580	5392020	Yeah, it's got the corner.
5392820	5396340	It's not as intimidating when he's attacking the bad guys.
5396340	5396980	Yeah.
5396980	5402260	So, Arch, I'm sure you've intuited this already, but the bloater is the stage after the clicker
5402260	5403860	and the stage before you become a big mushroom.
5405860	5408500	And you can run around and like spread spores as a bloater.
5408500	5409860	You can just spit spores everywhere.
5410660	5414260	And he's really annoying to deal with in the game because he's very bullet spongy.
5414260	5417940	However, he has like an insta-kill attack, but just by infecting you with a bunch of
5417940	5418900	spores if you get close.
5419620	5425460	Um, they were always, even in the game, they were always more annoying than scary.
5425460	5428660	Clickers were always scarier because you had to stealth them.
5428660	5430100	You can't stealth a bloater.
5430100	5431620	They're always like a boss fight, you know?
5432500	5434900	Yeah, the bloater was the quote unquote boss of the universe.
5434900	5436740	Like Dead Space had the invincible necromorph.
5436740	5438100	This had the bloaters.
5438100	5441460	Like they're there to try to drive up tension.
5442180	5446580	But if you get caught on a section like that, that can, you know, the tilt factor starts
5446580	5447220	to rise.
5447220	5448020	Oh, that's the thing.
5448020	5454020	Any monster that is described as annoying or frustrating is not a scary monster.
5454020	5457460	It's a video game mechanic that you recognize as a video game mechanic.
5457460	5457960	Yep.
5458500	5461780	It's all about raising tension and how you execute that.
5461780	5462340	And you know what?
5462340	5465940	It's the example of the fucking alien from, uh, from aliens video game.
5465940	5469860	The sooner, the moment you realize it's a fucking video game mechanic, it ceases being
5469860	5470820	scary.
5470820	5471140	Yeah.
5471140	5471380	Yeah.
5471380	5475540	And isolation is really bad that where you just like, you can tell how the AI director
5475540	5476020	works on it.
5476020	5476900	This isn't scary.
5476980	5478420	It just runs circles around me.
5480180	5485220	So, uh, compare the introduction of the bloater in this episode, which is it runs, it comes
5485220	5490180	out of the hole in the ground and there's like a, you know, uh, uh, uh, a soundtrack
5490180	5492260	that makes it sound like it's going to be a big fight.
5492260	5495140	And then he starts like beating up people and he's like ripping people's heads off.
5495140	5499140	And I mean, it's cool and gory, but it's not scary.
5499140	5505140	Now compare that to, um, to the introduction of the clicker back in episode two where they're
5505140	5509620	all like extremely quiet for multiple minutes and they're just like, shut the fuck up.
5509620	5510980	This is extremely scary.
5510980	5512340	And they're tiptoeing around.
5512340	5517620	And then when it finally shows up, they're like, it was significantly, the clicker's
5517620	5519780	introduction was significantly better.
5519780	5520100	Yep.
5520100	5521700	They did better job of tension.
5521700	5525220	What they should have done with the bloaters, the bloaters shouldn't be there to save them
5525220	5526500	like from the bad guys.
5526500	5527540	That's stupid.
5527540	5531140	The bloaters should be this thing they bump into, but it can't quite get them because
5531140	5533220	of its large bloated body.
5533220	5537300	But you are quickly figuring out very, you know, just through this audio that have been
5537300	5542260	moving around that it's, it's something big, it's something threatening and you start to
5542260	5543220	generate tension.
5543860	5546020	This didn't generate tension because it sort of came out of the ground.
5546020	5552100	I was like, there's also the problem that what it did have was it had no payoff effect.
5552100	5552340	Okay.
5552340	5554180	So we'd kill Santa Claus.
5554180	5556820	And I don't know who the fuck Santa Claus is.
5556820	5557940	He's just a dude.
5557940	5563060	And he's with the woman who is vastly oversold as some kind of villain.
5563060	5568100	And then she's killed by a zombie thing like, there's no payoff there.
5568100	5570340	It's just, it's just randos getting killed.
5570340	5573860	And the show shows it as if you're supposed to give a fuck.
5573860	5575380	It's like, oh no, Santa Claus.
5576580	5578660	I don't think you're supposed to be sad about it.
5579220	5580500	Well, no, you're supposed to care.
5580500	5582820	You're supposed to be like, yeah, he killed Santa Claus.
5582820	5583860	He was a bad person.
5585860	5587460	I don't necessarily think so.
5587460	5594100	I think like they were trying to portray the group as like a bit mixed, like a bit extreme,
5594100	5600340	but I don't think like, I also think like Santa Claus looked like a bit remorseful or
5600340	5602660	questions if he was doing the right thing at the point.
5603460	5607700	Yeah, they tried to, he was like, no, no, you, you woman, you gave us the thing.
5607700	5609460	We kill all these people and we're behind you.
5609460	5611060	Like, I don't think he had any remorse.
5611060	5614340	If anything, I think he was annoyed that this wasn't the plan of the great leader.
5615220	5620420	I think he was like a bit, felt a bit conflicted because he felt like the woman was a bit extremist.
5621940	5623060	I don't agree with you.
5623060	5628260	And the reason I don't is because there was that one section where he asked, we're not
5628260	5629460	giving them a trial, are we?
5629460	5630260	And she's like, no.
5630260	5633380	And he just goes, like, he seemed to be on board.
5633380	5634260	He seemed to be on board.
5634980	5635780	Fair enough.
5635780	5636740	But I don't know.
5636740	5640020	They could have given them more characterization.
5640020	5647300	I think they were also like mostly like back way more in the background in the game too.
5647300	5653380	So they still only had like, they had to pretty much write entirely new characters, I guess.
5654340	5657860	And that's kind of the thing there, because I wouldn't be anywhere near as annoyed by
5657860	5663940	this if they didn't try to sell them so hard, if they were just like background character
5663940	5667300	and it was alluded to that they had done something horrible, like, okay, fine.
5667300	5669140	It's a traveler story again.
5669220	5671300	But they tried to sell them.
5671300	5674020	Like they tried to be like, oh, there's a complex story here.
5674580	5676740	Necessarily think they tried to sell them.
5676740	5684740	They think they more of that just like gave them more filling as opposed to just like,
5685300	5689700	oh, these are bandits and they steal and rape and shit.
5689700	5694820	I mean, they dedicated several scenes to like building up the reason why she did this, to
5694820	5697140	try and make her sympathetic yet still evil.
5697380	5698980	Yeah, it didn't work.
5699700	5702580	They needed either more time with them or less, I think.
5702580	5704180	Yes, either more or less.
5704900	5705540	One of the two.
5706980	5707460	Fair enough.
5707460	5710900	I thought what I thought there was fine for the most part.
5710900	5713060	It could have used a bit more, but.
5713060	5718420	And to be fair, Lilith, they did say on Rotten Tomatoes that this scored a 90% audience approval
5718420	5720500	rating, which is less than the hundred average.
5720500	5722580	But still, I mean, 90 is pretty high.
5723220	5727300	So it's like it's this is still a liked episode.
5727300	5728500	It's still a like show.
5728500	5730260	People are still really enjoying this.
5730260	5734900	It seems it's just that this I think even the people who like the show recognize that
5734900	5737540	this is probably the worst episode of the five so far.
5737540	5740900	I don't know if this if this show deserves even even a 90.
5740900	5743620	Like it's a good show, but it's not like 100% good.
5743620	5746980	No, no, it's the modern day.
5747620	5750580	Everything now is either a train wreck or a masterpiece.
5750580	5756900	It's this I miss the good old days where if a show got a six, you're like above average.
5756900	5757780	I might check that out.
5759300	5760500	I don't remember those days.
5760500	5762340	I remember seeing a six and be like trash.
5762980	5764580	That's because you're a fetus.
5764580	5770020	I remember the good old days of the PC gaming magazines where a six meant above average.
5770660	5773140	Arch believing games journos caught now live.
5774900	5776660	Can you believe that guilt?
5777620	5782020	Like I remember fucking the only like super high scores that they used to give out there
5782020	5783620	was like for the really one.
5783620	5785700	It's like Diablo got like a nine.
5785700	5787220	Sacrifice got like a 10.
5787860	5790900	You know, the big companies that had the big paychecks here.
5794820	5800500	Well, I don't know if any of you three remember this, but back in 2006.
5800500	5805140	All right, back in 2006 on 4chan's video game board.
5806020	5809060	When when it was either IGN or GameSpot.
5810100	5814340	Gave a Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess an 8.8 out of 10.
5815140	5820740	That was considered like a fucking high crime against gaming to give a Zelda title less
5820740	5825460	than a nine and like 8.8 became a meme for years.
5826980	5828340	You know, it's probably worth it.
5828340	5830660	Honestly, it's probably it's probably about 8.8 to be honest.
5830660	5839540	Though we need to be returning to the numerical score system had a purpose and a point, but
5839540	5843300	it has long since lost that purpose because now everything is either a one or a 10.
5843860	5844100	Yeah.
5844100	5846340	And they're just quibbling around degrees.
5846340	5851380	Like five is meant to be average in the numerical score system, but no one uses it that way,
5851380	5851620	right?
5851620	5856420	Like if you especially if you're like talking about, you know, let's say like someone's
5856420	5857700	attractiveness, right?
5857700	5860820	If you say someone's a four out of 10 or a five out of 10, that's like saying there
5860820	5861220	is zero.
5861860	5864900	And if you if you say someone there, someone is like an eight out of 10.
5864900	5865940	That's like saying there are 10.
5866500	5871060	So it does seem like the whole numbers thing has kind of fallen apart in recent years.
5872580	5876020	Have we said all we want to say about The Last of Us episodes four and five?
5876980	5878500	Yeah, yep.
5879380	5880420	Yep, I think so too.
5881940	5885940	Next week, we should be able to do things normally again, because unless Archie have
5885940	5887700	some more IRL things happening.
5888660	5890100	No, I'm good next week.
5890100	5890820	Very good.
5890820	5893380	So no more Super Bowl, no more.
5894420	5900260	I think everything should be fine unless like some some drastic event happens, which I
5900260	5902820	mean probably will happen, to be honest, knowing our luck.
5902820	5905860	But hopefully we'll all be here for next week.
5907220	5907860	That's okay.
5909780	5911700	The Redskins won, by the way.
5911700	5913220	They're still called the Redskins.
5914180	5916260	They're called the Chiefs now, which is not much better.
5918340	5920580	Damn, it's not as based.
