00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
Hello, everyone. Welcome back to us watching The Last of Us. This will be episodes four

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,840
and five. We missed a few. So it turns out, Lilith, that you couldn't make it for episode

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,760
three due to some IRL shenanigans. So you got all caught up.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,680
Yep. I watched episode three, actually just today.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:30,920
And then episodes, basically, we missed episode four, because Arch, you had some sort of IRL

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,000
stuff to do with your job, right? You couldn't be around?

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,720
I was occupied, oh yes, I had to get up super early in the morning,

8
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,800
and I would have gotten about two hours of sleep.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,040
And episode five, it turns out, actually came out a couple of days ago, but because it was,

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,640
it was preempted because tonight is the Super Bowl. And in fact, my IRL friends are off watching

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,480
the Super Bowl, and I'm a nerd, recluse, and I don't care about sports ball, so I'm here

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,880
watching The Last of Us with you guys. Let's talk about the sports ball. So as far

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,640
as I understand, there's a racist team against a group of birds.

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,320
Oh, is that how it is? Is it the Redskins or whatever? I don't know the teams.

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:21,240
One is called the Chiefs. I don't think they're Native Americans though, so that's really racist.

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,560
Yeah, because Arch, you're Norwegian, you don't really care about American hand egg.

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,800
And Lilith, you never seem like a sporty type to me. But Kibbs, you live in the American

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,800
heartland. How are you not watching sports ball like your brothers?

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:47,720
Sports boring. Well, there we go. He has a, he has a personal trauma with the hand egg.

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,480
So, oh, really can't watch it anymore. What's the story? What's the story? It fell on me in school.

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:00,280
I broke my collarbone. Is that true? That did. But that wasn't the reason why I don't watch sports.

22
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,520
I just, I don't like watching. Like, I, I like to play. No, I'm kind of the same much better reason

23
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,280
though. Like if, you know, you see the sports ball and you just imagine the enormous tuckas

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,640
coming towards you. No, it was his knee. And it would, like, it's not the, it's not the hands.

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,680
Well, here Kibbs, you know what? I, next time we play sports, I'll fall on you just,

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,960
just to round it out, okay? Devil, shoot you if you do that.

27
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,680
If I can, you know, move my arms, assuming, because what breaks.

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,080
Thanks. So we're, we're going to watch episodes four and five today. And, but first Lilith,

29
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,360
you wanted to give your take on episode three since, you know, a brief take because

30
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,160
you, you weren't here last time. Yeah, I thought it was pretty well handled. Like,

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,320
they depicted a libertarian character and who was like, libertarian representation.

32
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,760
Yes, libertarian representation with the don't tread on me and everything. And,

33
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,280
which is to be expected if you play like the game. Well, if you're familiar with the Bill character

34
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,160
who helps out Joel and Ellie and anyways, who's just basically like a prepper and a handyman

35
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:21,320
and can build all sorts of traps and resulted in one of the more memorable scenes in the game,

36
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:27,560
where it's like, Joel's just hung upside down by the leg and has to shoot zombies while Ellie gets

37
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,680
him down. Oh, that part was actually quite hard. I remember being very frustrated playing that

38
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,560
because like your controls are fucking inverted. Jesus.

39
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,000
You've got libertarians here, you've got gun-toting zero immigration

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,200
fucking build a fence now. It's like, that's woke. Is it?

41
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:55,080
It's about as chat as they get if, if only Frank was like a woman and like, it's like

42
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,400
perfect picturesque married couple living together, supporting each other and make,

43
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,800
making sure enriching each other's lives and having a homestead and harming and all that

44
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:15,080
trat stuff, but they don't like it because Frank is a man who speaks in gay or the crossing sword.

45
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:23,640
And like the, the actual like radical left gay stereotype are the people who are like

46
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,640
pissing all over each other on the pride float with, with children watching. And it's like,

47
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:35,240
that's not what these guys are about. You know? Yeah. The thing is, if you were to change,

48
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,240
if we were to go back change, the fact that it's not the last was take the same story arc

49
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,240
and literally change one of the characters into a girl. I guarantee you there's other people at

50
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,200
base to be speech. Like that's all that no one would have any problem with it. And that's okay.

51
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,680
So the director guy was like, Oh, I put the gay in there. It's like a trick. I fed it to you in

52
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,560
the brownie. I don't care. Like I've never been an opposition to gay people. And you've just

53
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,000
presented me with a perfectly fine conservative romance. Like, yup. You didn't trick me into

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,840
anything. You checked yourself, bro. They didn't really change anything. It's like,

55
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,240
uh, bill is gay in the game. Like, uh, the only difference was, uh, they changed the ending. Yeah.

56
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,960
This one, they had a happy ending where they didn't get separated.

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,120
Literally the only point of quote unquote propaganda is that it's a hyper idealized ending

58
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,640
and it is like all of their machinery is working. They still have fuel. They still have

59
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,520
fancy dinners. They still have fucking wine. Like, um, I was really surprised when they,

60
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:39,000
when they cast, uh, Nick Offerman as the, uh, libertarian survivalist bill, by the way,

61
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,320
it was like, that's like the perfect fricking casting because, uh, Ron Swanson and just like

62
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,040
the most memeable libertarian character in television. I watched it again with Naomi,

63
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,880
right? Cause she wanted to see the episode too. And it was a good episode. So I didn't

64
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,640
mind watching it again. And I noticed something subtle about it. I didn't notice the first time

65
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:05,800
through. Um, when you see bill, like, you know, before he meets up with Frank, you know, there's

66
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,800
the army's going around clearing out all the houses and he's, he's in his bunker and he's like

67
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,280
new world order fucks, w E F motherfucker. You're not going to get me out of here.

68
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,560
He seemed like your average, you know, off the grid Republican voter at the start of the, um,

69
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,000
at the start of his story, he's like, you know, he's, he's hiding, he's, he's, he's very handy.

70
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,520
He's doing things for himself. He doesn't care about other, he doesn't care so much about our

71
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,000
society. You know, he's, he's keeping to himself. He's, he's building up his compound. Um, he's

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,960
happy that other people are gone. And however, he also seems like in after watching it the second

73
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,880
time, he's probably closeted gay, you know, and then when Frank comes along and he realizes that

74
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,520
Frank is also gay, that moment when they're both in bed, they're both lying in bed. And Frank asks

75
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,160
him, have you ever had sex with another man before? And he nervously says no, only with a

76
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,800
girl. Once when I was younger, it seemed to me that bill was like, probably closeted, probably

77
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,880
a little bit homophobic, but now that society's fallen apart, he can basically do whatever he

78
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,800
wants without being judged by whoever was around him before. And so he's taking this chance with

79
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,360
Frank. There basically can't be a more pro gay story than that of a guy coming out of the closet

80
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,360
after years of repression and then finding a romance.

81
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,840
Apparently Ben Shapiro got super duper pissed off about Bill and Frank.

82
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,640
Oh, yes. That's one thing we should talk about real quick. So Arch, last episode, you basically

83
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,200
said that this was a good romance and I think you repeated it today. It was a good romance.

84
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,920
It was a good representation of a positive representation of a conservative gay romance.

85
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,240
And in fact, Arch, I think you, you milked this topic on your channel for all it was worth. You

86
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,800
did like three videos on how the right should be claiming Bill and Frank. Is that, is that correct?

87
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,040
No.

88
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,800
Milked.

89
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,520
You squeezed.

90
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,880
That's not really, this turned into a controversy is not really the right word because there were

91
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,120
people who disagreed with my take on this. And I think it is because we are too used to being

92
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,800
defensive. We have to be against things because we have to counter the woke. But

93
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,800
again, the thing is, if you did this romance and you made Frank into a big breasted blonde woman,

94
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,120
nobody would have any problems with this at all. And, you know, it wouldn't be an issue.

95
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,640
If anything, the only complaint would be the same that I have, that it was overly idealized

96
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,840
and that they had no problems whatsoever. Really. There's like one raid that was easily repelled by

97
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,800
the electrified fucking fence. I do think the right should be claiming these characters because

98
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,240
they are clearly hashtag our side. So to say these, these are libertarians. They are not woke.

99
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,920
They don't seem there was, how do I put it? Like at no point did they bring in politics into their

100
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:55,080
relationship. They didn't sit around the table going like, Oh, I was pressed under a patriarchy

101
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,200
or anything like that. It was just two people who fell in love and I don't see anything wrong with

102
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,320
that. So you sent me a little Twitter post from some breadtuber who was like, Oh God, I can't

103
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,040
wait for the conservatives to see this. They'll be seething and molding. This is exactly why we

104
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:18,360
should be claiming these two characters because nothing would piss the workers off more than

105
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:26,120
having the, cause they've owned the identity of gay now for 20 years and they've used it as a

106
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,360
political tool. Taking it away from them has got to be the funniest thing we could possibly do.

107
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,920
So what you're talking about arch is that a Xander hall made this post me watching Nick Offerman get

108
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,120
a blow job for another man in the last of us and imagining the reaction of the chud YouTubers who

109
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,600
have to watch the scene to review the episode. Now, firstly, like this is Xander hall, dude,

110
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,080
you got to stop thinking you got to unplug from the culture, the culture war. Okay. Because you

111
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,800
probably shouldn't be thinking about like, you're gonna sit down with your girlfriend or with your

112
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,240
friends or whoever with your discord, whoever you're gonna sit down and watch a wholesome

113
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,240
hour of TV, have a good time. And what you're thinking of is, man, I bet the people that I

114
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,480
hate on the internet are mad right now. It's like, Jesus Christ, dude, Xander hall, what the fuck?

115
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,160
You gotta, you gotta like turn off the internet and put down the bong or something like Christ.

116
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,280
See, I don't know what a Xander hall is. So I don't know the context here, but

117
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,480
uh, okay. Listen, listen arch. I presume he's a communist judging by

118
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:33,000
Vash with minus 20 IQ points and too much weed. That's Andrew. So in reply to Xander hall,

119
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,600
there was one guy named comrade giga Chad. He, him who says, surprisingly, they don't hate it.

120
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,760
At least this one doesn't. And then links your video arch. It links your video.

121
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,160
And then somebody else responded to like, it makes me worried. What are they getting out of it? I'm

122
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,400
like, it's just two conservatives having a romance. That's all I'm getting out of it.

123
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,080
See, I'm going to do a video on this, right? Because at some point I'll do a video. I have

124
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:07,000
to flush this out a little bit, a little bit more, but basically the right knows what the left looks

125
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,760
like from the point of view of being inside the left, but the left has no clue what the right

126
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,320
looks like from being, from the point of view of being inside the right. And there's a clear,

127
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,680
there's a clear like imbalance there between the knowledge of each other.

128
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,320
And that's why I think we're seeing stuff like this of why does a right winger like arch Warhammer

129
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,280
like a con like a gay romance? And it's like, Hmm, maybe you need to reevaluate how you view

130
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,680
the fucking world dude. But well, actually, that's an interesting idea you have there.

131
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,640
Cause I hadn't thought about that. I've seen, I figured that they would be able to,

132
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,440
how do I put this? Like all the shit that people say about me, I figured they were just lying

133
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,480
because it seemed like a good attack angle, but they might also just not understand. Cause I have

134
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:01,720
never at any point said, I've been anti-gay, but at least I can't remember. You know what it is?

135
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:11,880
I just assumed like, Oh, you're somebody who is on the right. And therefore you must hate the gays.

136
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,280
Well, it could be that it could also be the fact that people on the left tend to take jokes,

137
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,440
like as not just a joke, but as a dog whistle for what you actually believe. So if you make

138
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,040
jokes at the expense of gay people, that means that you actually secretly hate gay people.

139
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,880
That's a very common thing the left does. So maybe that's what they're doing because

140
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,280
all of us here, including you, Lilith, even though you try to keep a damper on it because

141
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,960
you don't want to get canceled. But I understand. I understand. I know what lies in your dark heart.

142
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,120
Actually, all of us here have made like jokes at the expense of gay people,

143
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,120
but they're jokes. And we know that we're jokes, but you're saying we know that they're jokes.

144
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,080
And we know that we're all actually cool with them. You know, when we say breed Kibs,

145
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,680
we don't mean to actually like denigrate Kibs because he's a gay bottom. All right.

146
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,080
We're just having we're just having fun. Oh, no, just make it.

147
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:12,360
You say at the expense of like, I don't think of it like that. For me, the the core

148
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,280
fundamental of all humor is absurdity. And sure, homophobia is a fairly absurd concept,

149
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,560
like being afraid of gays. The issue is, though, is that Arch,

150
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,520
while you were doing your milk and a lot of your a lot of your comments were saying stuff like,

151
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,400
No, we actually shouldn't claim Bill and Frank. And they were fighting back with you. Like,

152
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,720
I know I've been getting into into fights with my comments section. But this time you've been like,

153
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,200
you've been taking some hits over this. Not really. Like a grand total. I lost six

154
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:51,720
subscribers, which, oh, no, no, I've lost a few too. Like, I'm not the kind of guy who's like,

155
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,280
oh, they didn't matter or anything like that. But the things I felt like I had a very

156
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:02,040
good, frank discussion with my community over it. We did a stream, I talked to them,

157
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,280
we had a conversation back and forth, they kept to tell me their arguments, I got to tell them theirs.

158
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,640
I think it worked out fairly well, honestly. No, fair enough. Like, I'm not saying that,

159
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,600
like, oh, no, you lost subscribers. I'm not saying that. But like, I looked at the comments

160
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,960
in some of those videos. And they were like, no, these are degenerates. Some people were

161
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,760
saying shit like that. Like, oh, Jesus, you also got to remember, like, when it comes to the

162
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:28,120
creative sphere and in feedback, and then when it comes to critique, always the most loudest voices

163
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,920
are often those that are going to be the most vulgar sometimes. Yeah, that goes for whether

164
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,440
you're making a video game and you release it and be like, oh, I hate these mechanics,

165
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:43,000
you know, or you're just making a video, like, they're just gonna rise to the top, the scum

166
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,760
rises to the surface. There are there were a lot of comments actually read that were actually

167
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,840
pretty well mannered, and pretty well, well constructed. And they actually raised some

168
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,120
excellent points. And we brought those up on stream and we had a good chat about it.

169
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,800
Then we get to what you mentioned to start this whole section off Lilith,

170
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:07,880
which was Ben Shapiro's video called Brokeback Zombie Farm. And it's like, come on, dude. Ben,

171
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:15,000
what the fuck? Now, Ben Shapiro, like he's obviously like a partisan rightoid. So like,

172
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,880
this is expected to come out of him, right? But he did the whole culture war. I can't believe

173
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,480
they're shoehorning the gays into this perfectly fine The Last of Us show. And it's like, Ben,

174
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,240
what are you doing? Come on. I know clicks. I get it. I get it. You know, your video had half a

175
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,600
million views pregnant, made some money off of it. I get it. You have a company to fund. This is

176
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,480
just partisan hackery. It is indeed difficult to argue they shoehorned in since it was in the

177
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,480
game. It was in the game. They gave them a happier ending, and they spent far more time on it. And

178
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,400
I'm still not sure that was worth it. We'll have to see how the rest of the show turns out because

179
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,920
this was an entire episode dedicated to a pair of side characters. Yeah, so because here's the

180
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,400
thing in the original game, Bill and Frank don't come back after the segment. So you're not gonna

181
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,480
get any payoff. And they're also unless they change it unless they change it. So actually,

182
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,040
we didn't die. I decided not to kill myself. And it's just the other guy dead in there.

183
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,600
If we get to see more Nick Offerman, I mean, yeah, but I don't they'd ruin the story bringing

184
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,880
them back, though. Yeah, they probably would. Yeah. I don't know if you all watched Ben Shapiro's

185
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:29,880
video on this. I did watch it. He just he spends the whole time complaining from a purely culture

186
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:37,000
warrior perspective. You know, it's like, Oh, this is the LGBT ideology lobby pushing

187
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,440
gays into your TV again. And it's like, listen, you gotta, you gotta calm the fuck down with

188
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,920
us, Ben. Like, no, things have swung too far in the other direction. Now, right, like,

189
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,560
five or six years ago, we were complaining about them shoehorning in trans people or gay people

190
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,320
where it didn't matter race swapping to black characters where it didn't matter. And it's like,

191
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,920
this is kind of cringy. Like, what the fuck are you doing? Now, though, the reaction to that has

192
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,440
become so severe that anytime you see like a gay person in the media, these people are like flying

193
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,920
off the handle. And it's become too much in the other direction now. Yes, we our side is in the

194
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,920
ascendancy. And we need to recognize that rather than continuing on the defense. It feels just like

195
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:26,200
a money farm or a click farm. It's just like, oh, that's, oh, this is another thing where I get to

196
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:33,640
get riled up and make lots of angry clicks with like, oh, it's so cynical, like gays have been

197
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,600
appearing in television since forever. It's like now we're seeing more of it because now we're

198
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:46,120
seeing there are more gays and oh, gee, the FCC doesn't fine you thousands and thousands of

199
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:53,480
dollars if you show homosexuals in a non-negative light on television. Oh, I think he will also

200
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:00,200
complain about that two second clip of lesbians kissing in Buzz Lightyear too, didn't he? Yeah,

201
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,240
I think so. That was stupid. If he has to go to war with Steven Crowder, he needs all the money

202
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:13,720
he can get, you know? So basically like, like righty tube is doing the same thing that lefty

203
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,880
tube went through or like lefty twitch, you know, they're just eating each other at this point.

204
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,120
They've like isolated off into their own little internets. And now they're in fighting for,

205
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,680
for clout. And I was, it's funny to laugh at when it happens on the, on the left. And it's

206
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,720
funny to laugh at when it happens on the right. And I think that basically Ben Shapiro losing it

207
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,880
over Bill and Frank is just a small component of that larger issue of it's just people scrabbling

208
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:49,320
for relevance. The inevitable spiral, it happened to Gamegate after people realized that once the,

209
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,280
the video game journalists horse had been beaten thoroughly to death,

210
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,320
a lot of people realized, well, we might not actually agree on everything.

211
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,120
And then a lot of egos in a very small room, et cetera, et cetera, and it's happening to the

212
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:07,480
left on red tube, et cetera. And it's happening again. Now, this is just the natural cycle of

213
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,120
content creation. I think I know a lot is going to be cut out, but we've been talking for like

214
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,160
nearly an hour and a half just shooting the shit. So maybe it's time, maybe it's time we should

215
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,360
actually watch the show. We have two episodes to get through.

216
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,240
Listen, I miss you guys. All right. It's a good time. You know, you could come in any time. We

217
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,800
stream a lot Bart and I know, I know, but usually I'm busy. Like I'm also working on things.

218
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,400
That's no excuse. You can always find time at somebody who has time management problems myself.

219
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,280
You know what I'll do? I'll break up with my girlfriend for you.

220
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll, I'll free up some time that way. Jesus.

221
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,400
Kibbs you have more. You're so demanding now. I'll start dating Kibbs. Okay.

222
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,280
Arch. Now I understand. And now I understand the, the, the dynamic here, what's going on

223
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,760
of, of why kids need to be, needs to be bullied. Cause otherwise he just sucks up all your free

224
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,720
time. He does. He's a woman. I have got queued up in the pipe episode. I think it's not for

225
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:17,960
me to still check. Yes. Episode four. Let's roll. It's currently black. I'm playing it right now.

226
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,160
Okay.

227
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,080
This is what I always expect.

228
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:47,400
I think the guitar at least. Yeah.

229
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:57,080
You know what? Unlike the rings of power, this song actually makes the intro worth watching.

230
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,920
I think it's a nice song. They actually incorporate it into the show too.

231
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,000
That's sort of what they're doing with like the new Mario movie from the looks of it too.

232
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,640
Yep. Yep. Hello aircraft carrier. It's been long since last time.

233
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,080
Fuck. There were some comments who were saying, arch, that you're too mean to this girl.

234
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,480
You know, she might be, but is she like, she, she does not fit the character. She just,

235
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,600
I'm sure she's a lovely human being, but at least she knows basic gun safety.

236
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:42,920
Yeah. I hope so. For giving her a gun. Oh, she found it. Oh, that's right. If he took

237
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,200
I expect to be gangster. Tilt the weapon. It lingers accuracy.

238
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,240
Put the safety on, man. You don't want to just randomly going off cause it hooks something in

239
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,600
your bag. Fun fact, the French rifles of the second world war did not have safeties.

240
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,560
So they just would go off. It was a bit unfortunate occasionally.

241
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,880
Yeah, no. Uh, if, if Litchin is growing on the cars, I guarantee you that fuel is not

242
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:25,720
usable. That would be jello years and years and years ago. 20 years. How long does gas last in

243
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:33,240
a tank a year? Like it lasts a year in an underground to be fair. This is something

244
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,400
that every single survival setting gets wrong. It'll still be stationary.

245
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:47,240
No pun intended volume two, but will Livingston volume two. Wait, is it a, this is a puns book.

246
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,400
Okay. This is the best show, the best character, the best episode. I love

247
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,880
already. Yes.

248
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,080
Feel free to wait in the truck. Okay. But just know you can't escape. We'll Livingston.

249
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,760
You'll be back. There's nothing you can do to stop him.

250
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:24,120
At least somebody cleared out the cars from being on the road. Very convenient of them.

251
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,520
Yeah. They conveniently just 45 degree parked them. Yeah. They used to take big ass plows

252
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,360
on them and clear the roads for their tanks. And so they actually explained it.

253
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:41,960
Oh wait, they're doing the yep. Right on the reading, but it has some interesting pictures.

254
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:48,200
No, no, no, no. Put that back. That's not for kids. Please get rid of it. That's actually

255
00:23:48,200 --> 00:24:03,720
kind of funny pages stuck together. Who knows? I know what coom is.

256
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,760
Okay. So that was shot for shot identical from the game.

257
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,560
Yes. Yeah. She finds the gay porn from bill stash.

258
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,360
You know, that one picture that people use to show like the downfall of America by having all

259
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:38,280
these like McDonald's and Arby's and all these restaurants. This is, it kind of looks like that.

260
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,920
That place, but the post-apocalypse.

261
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:55,240
Wow. That, that one spot of grass was clearly driven over several times for this shot.

262
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,440
That and the fact that, you know, you can clearly tell it's been mowed.

263
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,120
20 year old raviolis, dude.

264
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,680
Am I even eating that is 20 year old ship where do you ravioli? I actually agree.

265
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,560
So can we start a fire? I'm freezing. Now, why am I going to tell you? No,

266
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,640
because in fact, you don't see the smoke fungus in that smart.

267
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,680
This is about to say, anyway,

268
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:38,200
people remote, the fungal zombies just hang out and populated areas for some reason.

269
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:46,120
It's because of the all the connections with the fungus going underground. They stay in like urban

270
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:52,680
centers, literally just live outside the city and you'll be fine. Okay. So they're literally left.

271
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,440
Wait, the pun book, the pun book. She better say some more.

272
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,760
Why did the scarecrow get an award?

273
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,080
Because he was outstanding in his field.

274
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,200
This is sweet. The Joel and Ellie father and daughter moment. Those were like my favorite

275
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,160
parts in the game too. It actually makes me want to go out and camping.

276
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,320
Have you been camping before?

277
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,400
Man, I hate camping.

278
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,960
Correct. No one camping once. It was awful. Oh, it's percolator coffee.

279
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:41,320
How am I more outdoorsy than the two men? I live in Norway. The outdoors here will kill you.

280
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,440
I mean, same with Canada, right? Like, yeah, these are all woman excuses.

281
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,160
I would love to put you outside my backyard. Just 12 hours. Just 12.

282
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,200
Okay. I'm fine.

283
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:10,280
No, you can't. Yeah. I did scouts training on how to do it. You love it. Okay. I'll just

284
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,880
put you outside. No gear. Go sleep in the fucking snow drifts. That was not the stipulation.

285
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,120
Caves. I just want to point out that Lilith said that there's only two guys here.

286
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,320
Oh, you son of a bitch.

287
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,640
When Tommy meets Marlene, she talks me to join in the fireflies.

288
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,600
Same mistake you made. I got groomed. You got groomed.

289
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,280
You got up pretty early. If you want to grab more sleep, I'm not even tired.

290
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:51,880
Also from the game. Oh, no, we're entering Chicago.

291
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,600
Yeah. Okay. In America, there's highways going around all the major cities, right?

292
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,200
You don't have to go to the city. You can just go around it, actually.

293
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,880
Actually, why the hell would you go through a city? Other than to cut down time, I'd rather

294
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,040
go around it. Yep.

295
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,480
Because, Kip, this is where the fucking story happens in this television show that needs

296
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:21,000
conflict. If this was just driving to fucking wherever, pretty boring.

297
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,320
What are you talking about? That's a very cozy show.

298
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,880
25 hours of driving and Kyle was scratching at the wash. Please give me the faggots back.

299
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,920
Well, here's one. I am actually happy for. I like long road trips. Long road trips are fun.

300
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,360
So this looks like another level from the game because it has the soda truck in front

301
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,080
of the tunnel. So they're doing the same thing again.

302
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,880
But this isn't... Joel didn't lose the truck this way.

303
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,880
Right. They were ambushed by some group and that's what they call a truck, right?

304
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,960
Yeah. So I think this is actually the setup for a level in Salt Lake City near the end

305
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,520
of the game. That's what it looks like.

306
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
Go around it, man. Come on.

307
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,920
Screw it. They addressed Kyle's point and defeated it.

308
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:21,880
The answer was, he couldn't be honest. Take the next ramp and we're back on the road

309
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,760
many times. Now they are turning.

310
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,240
God damn it. Bye. Okay.

311
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,280
It's a smart thing to do, though. It's a smart thing to do.

312
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,480
I guess I'm right.

313
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,280
Yeah, but now you're going to see that it's a bad thing to do because there's going to

314
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,320
be like evil shit out there and they're going to have to turn around because that way the

315
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,040
plot can happen.

316
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,160
Don't you have a compass?

317
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,280
Uh, how old is that vehicle?

318
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,600
Well, no, I mean as an actual literal compass, you know, come here.

319
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,840
Compasses are those things in your smart car, right?

320
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,600
Actually, my old Jeep had one.

321
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,560
Oh no, this is the scene.

322
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,160
Yeah, that's a trap.

323
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,640
Okay. Never accept people in the apocalypse.

324
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:32,200
Oh, fuck.

325
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,680
See, they're going to come through the city.

326
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,320
Okay, so yeah, this is how it happened, yeah.

327
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,800
They missed the best one-liner, though.

328
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:56,680
In the game, there was a moment where Ellie asks,

329
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,320
aren't you going to help him? And he says, he's not even injured. He just runs him over.

330
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,360
He's like, he's injured now, motherfucker.

331
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:20,840
Oh, Arx, just so you know, there was like 50 guys to kill here in the game.

332
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,320
Yeah, he murdered like a fuckton.

333
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:32,360
Well, there came number 50.

334
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,920
Wow, they've got really good teeth,

335
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:48,840
considering the apocalypse has been going on for a few years.

336
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,680
Well, there should be plenty of crests lying around.

337
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,200
And toothbrushes.

338
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,400
Oh, lots of toothbrushes.

339
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,360
Can't aim that low.

340
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,200
You just shot Joel.

341
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,760
Joel's dead.

342
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,760
Yep, that was unfortunate.

343
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,760
Oh, well.

344
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,480
She couldn't know the bulbs got through things.

345
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm gonna go home.

346
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,040
I'll tell everyone you're good.

347
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,640
I don't know what to do.

348
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,680
My legs don't work.

349
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,040
My mom isn't far.

350
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,080
If you can get me to her.

351
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,920
You got to kill him, man.

352
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,240
We can trade with you guys.

353
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,040
We can be friends.

354
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,680
I didn't know.

355
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,760
I'm Brian.

356
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,560
I'm Brian.

357
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,120
What's your name?

358
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,960
I do appreciate this scene, actually.

359
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,880
And this is rather humanizing.

360
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,280
Okay.

361
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,000
Yeah.

362
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,240
Well, also it shows that Ellie's got to like harden up.

363
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,760
Remember, nobody's innocent after you shot them.

364
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,240
Wait, wait, wait.

365
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,760
My dude, you tried to rob us.

366
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,720
Damn.

367
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,920
Ellie, I got to get in there.

368
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,720
I can't get through.

369
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
That was some harsh shit, but I appreciate it.

370
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah.

371
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,440
There's some stuff against the door.

372
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,440
See, this is also kind of why I understand why people were a bit annoyed by the whole

373
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,400
gay romance thing, because it was overly idealized.

374
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,480
And it was a happy ending in a universe that doesn't have a whole lot of fucking happy

375
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:35,980
endings.

376
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,200
The Bergquists.

377
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,540
No.

378
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,080
Mark Anthony Halpin.

379
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,480
Carrie Schreiber.

380
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,840
Haven't seen them.

381
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,680
The Chans.

382
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,680
Henry Burrell.

383
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,400
Okay.

384
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,040
You know where Henry is.

385
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,280
Lawyer.

386
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,480
Medical attention.

387
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,880
Family visit.

388
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,880
I've completely fallen off the plot now.

389
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,000
Who are these people?

390
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,200
What has to stop now?

391
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:22,200
Uh, the Kansas City Fedra was overrun by bandits.

392
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,240
They've taken over.

393
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:32,760
Jesus.

394
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,520
Now, I got to point out, no matter how much of a douchebag that guy might have been, if

395
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,320
he's your only trained medical professional, that was a very, very, very bad idea.

396
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,000
Yeah, extremely.

397
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,240
Yeah.

398
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,160
Basically, you definitely have a bad idea.

399
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,660
Yep.

400
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,160
So she said, find every collaborator and kill them all.

401
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:03,720
So I don't know if they'll get to it, but in the game, the people had overthrown Fedra,

402
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,960
like Firefly style, and they immediately devolved into a gang.

403
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,880
Because of course they would, after you overthrow the government.

404
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,080
There's no utopia here.

405
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,720
And then they ended up being worse than Fedra.

406
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,520
And yeah, you all know how it goes.

407
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,840
Were they cannibals also, or was that a different group?

408
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,320
They might have been the cannibals.

409
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,200
I don't know.

410
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,320
I don't know if cannibals were later.

411
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,760
There was just like a hellhole maybe.

412
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,760
There was a cannibal group later though, I think.

413
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,200
Listen, human flesh with mushrooms built in, pretty convenient.

414
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,560
You eat mushrooms?

415
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,720
You don't put mushrooms in your pizza?

416
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:46,840
No.

417
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,280
Depends on what kind of pizza you're making.

418
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,960
You ever had a good Canadian pizza?

419
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,760
Bacon and mushrooms?

420
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,800
As soon as we don't hear it, we move.

421
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,360
No, bacon.

422
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,960
Fast as we can.

423
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,200
Canadian bacon.

424
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:01,720
We got you.

425
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,160
I think neither of you should exist.

426
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,680
You need to widen your pallet or widen you.

427
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,720
It's not all about post D&D pastries, Arch.

428
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,200
Are you okay?

429
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,240
His pastry is a sandwich with a piece of meat and cheese in it.

430
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,240
First time that you hurt someone like that.

431
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,920
See, this is why it's much better to not do this in the video game format too,

432
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,560
because here they just kill like three people who attacked them,

433
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,560
and it's entirely justifiable for him to still, you know, feel bad about killing people.

434
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,680
It's a hard thing.

435
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,480
But if he just murdered his way through a hundred fucking dudes, it would feel somewhat hollow.

436
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:39,980
Yep.

437
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:47,980
In the game, I think characters also somewhat acknowledge that Joe's like a mass murdering,

438
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,660
like an absolute beast of a man in the background too.

439
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,420
Sometimes, yeah.

440
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:53,920
Yeah.

441
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,020
Up where they had to tone everything down a bit.

442
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,100
I end up a little bit better than the epic storyline.

443
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,100
Here, have your little girl pistol back.

444
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,460
Did you take out the magazine?

445
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,520
No?

446
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,140
Ah, the feds didn't know how to handle horror small arms.

447
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,420
They truly were the ATF.

448
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,020
Safety on trigger discipline.

449
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,980
No, you put it in your pack.

450
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,180
Shoot your damn ass off.

451
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,300
You shoot your damn ass off through your backpack or there's more clutter.

452
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,100
Now that means she's going to shoot herself accidentally, I bet.

453
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,820
They're going to add that.

454
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,060
Or like someone's going to steal it out of her pocket.

455
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,100
That's going to come back to bite her.

456
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,600
Maybe, yeah.

457
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,260
Got mushrooms.

458
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,040
Fuck.

459
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,900
What did we tell the others?

460
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,580
Not yet.

461
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,500
Let's just handle what we have to handle.

462
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,700
We can deal with this after.

463
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,340
Kathleen.

464
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:47,840
After.

465
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:53,340
You have mushroom veins burrowing into your compound.

466
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:53,840
Okay.

467
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,140
Like you got to handle that shit now.

468
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,100
The personal vendetta thing is going to be the thing that dooms them.

469
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,460
Here's a problem.

470
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,500
Clearly, you guys know more about what the fuck's happening here than I do.

471
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,180
Because I am completely confused.

472
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,220
I don't know who this woman is.

473
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,380
I don't know why the clearly more senior and experienced man is taking directions from her.

474
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,300
I don't understand what the fuck's going on.

475
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,620
Like hell, I wouldn't even understand that they'd overrun Fedra unless you told me.

476
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:25,420
I feel like maybe explaining this would have been better use of the previous episode.

477
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,460
At least parts of it.

478
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,600
Maybe.

479
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,980
And I am lost.

480
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,100
I can't really remember this story that well.

481
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,180
In fact, I don't remember anything up until this point.

482
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:45,500
But like the federal stuff, like you can tell with visual storytelling because you had like federal building walls or blood smeared on the walls charge anymore.

483
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,300
Did you kill innocent people?

484
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,460
Innocent is a complicated word in the post apocalypse.

485
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,000
Joe.

486
00:39:59,340 --> 00:39:59,840
What?

487
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,620
What are you doing?

488
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,220
I don't want someone sneaking up on us while we're sleeping.

489
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,640
I get it.

490
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,980
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

491
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,940
I mean, they can see you from the door.

492
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,380
It's a good point.

493
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:12,880
Okay.

494
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,580
To shoot you, but.

495
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,540
I put the glass outside the door, to be honest.

496
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,220
I guess it's a good thought.

497
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,860
Don't get me wrong.

498
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,300
It's just poorly executed.

499
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,500
Side sleeping is the only way to sleep, by the way.

500
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,340
When we were talking about hurting people.

501
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,500
What did you mean it wasn't your first time?

502
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,660
I mean, she tried to gut you with a pocket knife the first time you met her.

503
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,700
So talk about it.

504
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,700
She goes in a doc.

505
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,500
All right.

506
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,000
Okay.

507
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,740
Enter credit card to proceed.

508
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,040
Basically.

509
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,900
So it gets easier when you get older.

510
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,100
No, not really.

511
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,060
Yeah.

512
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,940
When you hit a certain age and actually care, turns out to be kind of fun.

513
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,680
Yeah.

514
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,020
Did you know diarrhea is hereditary?

515
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:10,880
What?

516
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,080
Yeah.

517
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,460
It runs in your genes.

518
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,100
That's great.

519
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,740
He thought it was funny too.

520
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,500
So goddamn stupid.

521
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,980
Jesus, I'm losing it.

522
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,500
You're losing it big time.

523
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,220
The character bonding.

524
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:40,860
Not too bad.

525
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,420
The only person who didn't laugh was Arch.

526
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,420
Arch, you hate puns, don't you?

527
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,140
He's not a human.

528
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:48,940
I'm sorry.

529
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,100
My intelligence is finally fucking high for this.

530
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,180
You're more of a lizard.

531
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,180
You remind me of that Facebook guy.

532
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,260
That Facebook guy.

533
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,340
This part is not funny according to the algorithms.

534
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:15,420
I told you they had guns.

535
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,500
Well, that's Henry.

536
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,740
I think that's Henry and Sam.

537
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,240
Yeah.

538
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,580
Well, there we go.

539
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,260
End of the first episode.

540
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,380
Well, no, the fourth episode.

541
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,180
The first one tonight.

542
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,580
There we go.

543
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:41,020
So yes, I can tell right from the beginning that one of the big problems with this episode

544
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,260
is they didn't adequately introduce the antagonist of the next section.

545
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,140
They just assume that if you played the game, you'd know who they are.

546
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,500
Yep.

547
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,140
Which does mean that Arch's point about the previous episode is now validated.

548
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:58,860
Because it would be fine to do that episode as like a bonus, like fluff thing.

549
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,700
As long as everything's like adequately explained.

550
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,500
But here the antagonist in the relationship is going to be explained in the next episode.

551
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,020
But the entire time you're just thinking, what, what, what?

552
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,820
Because Arch is like, what the fuck is going on here?

553
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,660
Because clearly there's a lot of story or rather who this woman is, why she shot their

554
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,980
only motherfucking doctor, why they're running a little Nazi dystopia now.

555
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,340
There's a lot that has happened here.

556
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,420
And that would probably have been a better use of the previous episode.

557
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:31,900
Yeah.

558
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,900
Spend more time building this up than that.

559
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,420
I don't know if I necessarily agree.

560
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:43,580
Cause like, I think the show could be going from like Joe and Ellie's perspective, because

561
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:49,580
to them, these are just a bunch of assholes with guns that showed up and they may as well

562
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,940
just been bandits and Raiders, which in some ways they are.

563
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,900
So that's true.

564
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,500
That's actually, that's actually a good point.

565
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,740
So I'll tell you how it goes down in the game Arch.

566
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,300
Okay.

567
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,820
I don't think it was Kansas city.

568
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,020
I think it was actually Pittsburgh.

569
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,380
It doesn't matter what city it was.

570
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,260
They have to go into a city.

571
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,860
For some reason, the roads are blocked off.

572
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,460
They have to drive through the city.

573
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:13,420
The exact same ambush happens where there's an injured guy, but this time Joel just runs

574
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:13,740
them over.

575
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,780
He's like, he's not even injured.

576
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,340
He runs them over.

577
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,460
They lose Bill's Bill's truck.

578
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,580
It crashes into a laundromat, which is what it did in the show.

579
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,140
And they have to work through the city on foot.

580
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:27,740
However, the path, because it's, you know, it's a linear video game.

581
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,020
The path takes them into the form of the former Fedra camp.

582
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:37,900
The gameplay is you're just killing a shit ton of people, of people just killing a shit

583
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,740
ton of basically of bandits.

584
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,580
And you can actually like listen to them talk.

585
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,980
And if you want to, if you want to get the story, you can listen to them talk about how

586
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,500
they, they overthrew Fedra and how they've been like just ambushing people who come,

587
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,460
who come through.

588
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,740
Sometimes they enslave people who come through a lot of backgrounds.

589
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:57,020
So you also find a data logs in the level because, you know, it's a, it's a video game.

590
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,340
So you can just, you can pick these up or you can ignore them.

591
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:05,900
The, the story basically was there was a group in this Fedra quarantine zone that was like

592
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,380
the fireflies, but wasn't associated with the fireflies.

593
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,100
They were these revolutionaries who wanted to overthrow the government.

594
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,620
They managed to do it.

595
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,820
They disbanded Fedra.

596
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,660
They purged all the people who were loyal to Fedra.

597
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,900
There was definitely some, you know, kind of communist rhetoric about what they were

598
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,500
doing, but of course they immediately descended into tyranny.

599
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,420
And what they do is they go out, they find people who are traveling around, they, they

600
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:29,980
kill them.

601
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,860
They take their stuff.

602
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,500
If they have kids, they take the kids, they brainwash the kids.

603
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,100
They turn them into workers for, for their new civilization.

604
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:43,100
And they're very, they're very utopian and they do not like people leaving even more

605
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,660
than Fedra.

606
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:49,660
It's, it's every, like all of Fedra, all of their equipment, worse morals, way more willing

607
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,300
to way, way more willingness to be ruthless.

608
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,740
Um, just Fedra, but worse and, and, and, and less competent all the way through.

609
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:58,940
But that's, this is the thing.

610
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,900
All of this stuff is like, it's all data log stuff.

611
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,220
It's all background conversation stuff in the game.

612
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,460
You can just fight through it and you don't even have to care about it if you don't want

613
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:06,780
to.

614
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,820
But there is a story here.

615
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,700
Um, the problem is you can't do data logs in a TV show.

616
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:18,220
So they had to somehow bring it into the show and they didn't do like, they didn't, they

617
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:23,180
did like a, like a 25% job of it because you can see like there's Fedra stuff, but they're

618
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,460
clearly not Fedra.

619
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,980
So there's like some environmental storytelling happening here, but they needed to do more

620
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,220
of it.

621
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:29,980
Yep.

622
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,300
Cause environmental only goes so far cause we can, we can easily deduct from the Fedra

623
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,140
building with blood smears and there's these like bandits that are occupying now that Fedra

624
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,980
has lost control of this region.

625
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,300
Yep.

626
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,620
Um, but it doesn't really explain like who these people are.

627
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,740
Now in the next episode, they're going to probably expand on the whole like Sam thing

628
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,540
and the fact that they're leaving, you know, the society and because

629
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,740
Don't spoil it, Kibbs.

630
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,620
Yeah, but it's game that's been out for a decade.

631
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:58,220
It's not even like, uh, like it's like, who, who is Luke's dad?

632
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,580
Like nobody cares anymore.

633
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,900
Nor you're spoiling arch for the next episode.

634
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,740
Yeah, but here's the problem.

635
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,180
This episode didn't give him any context for what the fuck was going on.

636
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,220
And that's the problem.

637
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:14,380
If the next episode begins to explain the context and that's, that's fair, but to address

638
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:18,380
the point as well, that is being taken from the perspective of Bill and Joel, that'll

639
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:18,940
be fine.

640
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:22,540
If it weren't for the fact that the preceding episode was not at all taken from the perspective

641
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:29,500
of Bill and Joel, making it a complete break from, oh, you mean Joel and Ellie?

642
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,740
People on the television screen.

643
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:31,980
Yes.

644
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,540
Cause that's the thing.

645
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,460
Like so long as the whole gay romance didn't detract from anything else, I thought it was

646
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,900
perfectly fine, but it depends on the next episode.

647
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,340
Like if they tell the story of what happened here through these two other characters that

648
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,340
just appeared, I'll be more than happy.

649
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:51,420
But if they never explain how the fuck this federal struggle is overrun, I'll be annoyed.

650
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:52,540
Yeah.

651
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:57,980
I thought it was fine to have a self-contained thing for episode three.

652
00:47:58,860 --> 00:47:59,980
And it has to be paid off though.

653
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,100
So something has to work out.

654
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:01,260
Yeah.

655
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,900
Everything else has to work together to do that.

656
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,860
Um, yeah.

657
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,940
So from, from what I recall, Henry and since we're spoiling it anyway, Henry and Sam in

658
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:13,420
the game wanted to leave the communist utopia and they were very mad about that.

659
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,460
And they were sending like, like just guys in trucks, truckloads of guys after them.

660
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,340
And, uh, Joel and Ellie just happened to be in the wrong place, wrong time.

661
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:28,380
Well, in this case, from the dialogue, it seems like a Henry got the brother of random

662
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,900
woman killed.

663
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:35,100
Uh, maybe it seemed like when the, cause they were in target in the doctor and he was like,

664
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,220
I didn't give them your brother's like, yes, but Henry did.

665
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,660
You gave them Henry, I guess.

666
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,020
Yeah, they're, they're implying that there.

667
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,820
So there's, there seems to be more motivation.

668
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,020
Yep.

669
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,860
We'll have to see personal vendetta too.

670
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,460
Yeah, we'll have to see.

671
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,780
So let's start up episode five.

672
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,660
I've got it queued up.

673
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,060
That's uh, that's roll.

674
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,740
So while this is playing, I'm just looking this up.

675
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,060
Twitter's actually gone kind of quiet on this show.

676
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,540
I don't know if that's good or bad.

677
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,940
I mean, there's no big controversy surrounding it anymore.

678
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:17,260
And this, you know, we're not counting Ben Shapiro's that was kind of nutsoid, but like

679
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,580
the normies just seemed to be watching and enjoying the show, but not really talking

680
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,220
about it.

681
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,340
I don't know how to take that.

682
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,780
Well, it's probably because the show is it's entertaining, but beyond that, I wouldn't

683
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,140
say it's like stellar.

684
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:30,780
It's just all right.

685
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,420
Nothing particularly special.

686
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,500
And it's not really pushing any particular point either, I guess.

687
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,980
Oh, it's just going to be, it's going to be the backstory, isn't it?

688
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,100
Of how they liberated, liberated the zone from the bedroom.

689
00:49:53,100 --> 00:50:01,180
It's a little bit of a waste.

690
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,420
Yeah, the people's revolution.

691
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,860
We all own the means of production.

692
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,380
Oh yeah.

693
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,100
These, uh, these definitely do look like heroes of justice.

694
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,580
That's for sure.

695
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,220
They're just killing the kulaks arch.

696
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,020
They deserved it.

697
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,460
Yeah, this is the problem with the revolution.

698
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:27,980
It's just going to make you the monsters.

699
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,860
I know you hang that person over a bonfire.

700
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,740
I don't believe you.

701
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,660
You will not really revolution it.

702
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,620
Yeah, like that's a great image of a fair trial.

703
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:46,780
Right?

704
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:47,340
Fuck him there.

705
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,260
Like I'd hand myself in in a heartbeat.

706
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:49,740
No doubt.

707
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:54,460
Wait, was the kid deaf in the last or mute in the, in the game?

708
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,180
I don't think he was.

709
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:57,740
I don't remember.

710
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,740
Did it feel good?

711
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,020
Betraying your neighbors to Fedra?

712
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,420
The struggle session.

713
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,140
Well, I'm not Fedra.

714
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,500
Lucky for you.

715
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,460
No one here has to die.

716
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,060
Yeah, we could put you on trial.

717
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:16,780
You're all guilty.

718
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,300
So that's how that'll go.

719
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:19,500
And you'll do some time.

720
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,820
Oh yeah, that's much better.

721
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:26,380
He had a place to hole up in the open city in case things went bad.

722
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,980
But things have gone great.

723
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,740
Haven't you heard Kansas city is free.

724
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,420
I do quite like this.

725
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,940
This is a very subversive take on communism.

726
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,420
I told you everything I know.

727
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,380
No, we are not really putting them on trial.

728
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,020
When you're done, burn the bodies.

729
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:51,740
It's faster.

730
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,980
Man, freedom.

731
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,420
People's Republic.

732
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:07,820
I've been saying like every great writer of history says one thing correct.

733
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,580
Even the people who are the worst like Marx or whoever I've been reading mold bug.

734
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,380
He has said one thing that I like only one thing.

735
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:17,900
And that one thing is sometimes freedom requires order.

736
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,540
And it can't just be anarchy.

737
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:25,900
You know, freedom from all possible institutions and just pure anarchy is no real freedom.

738
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,220
I agree with that.

739
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,100
That's why I'm a libertarian and not an uncap.

740
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:38,220
Like we need some form of order to ensure freedom for people.

741
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,940
Otherwise, it's just like warlords and well,

742
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:44,220
roaming.

743
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,660
Yes, it's just fucking this.

744
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,060
Yeah, or it's just fucking this.

745
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:50,060
He's scared because you're scared.

746
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,740
No, I'm pretty sure he's scared because he's Anne Frank now.

747
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,620
I'd be scared too.

748
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:04,940
Hello.

749
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:15,580
Well, he's deaf now.

750
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:16,800
Yep.

751
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,660
Look at me.

752
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,860
I am the captain now.

753
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,180
No, communists are still shooting people.

754
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:51,580
Okay, back to painting.

755
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,900
I always tell them not to whack on things.

756
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,060
Yeah, you could always eat the paint.

757
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:09,820
Oh, God.

758
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,100
All the crayon tasting.

759
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,660
You should probably go in the night, though, shouldn't you?

760
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,380
I don't know.

761
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:22,620
Communists are creatures of the dark, after all.

762
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,500
They might see better.

763
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,100
Like way skittered around the ceiling.

764
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,380
The suction cups.

765
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,020
Kibs, you're beeping.

766
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,660
What's going on?

767
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,980
What do you mean beeping?

768
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,060
I heard a beep in the background of your.

769
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,740
Oh, don't mind that.

770
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,860
It's your microwave from making those hot pockets.

771
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,940
Get it right in his eyes.

772
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,980
Make him blind, too.

773
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,860
Yeah, I'm not sure if smearing paint over your face is actually that intelligent.

774
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,660
I mean, it doesn't really do anything.

775
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,300
That depends on the paint, Kyle.

776
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,220
Have you gotten paint in your eyes?

777
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,300
Lead paint acrylic.

778
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,140
It's not fucking lead.

779
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,860
I think you let this kid play with lead paint.

780
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:12,140
Are you retarded?

781
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,260
It's the apocalypse.

782
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,300
Who cares?

783
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,380
It's acrylic paint.

784
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:21,900
Oh, also, I mean, not to get racist here or anything, but I mean,

785
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:27,180
they clearly are able to, like, stealth around at night easier because they're darker skinned.

786
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,540
Oh, my God.

787
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:29,340
I can't believe you went there.

788
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,460
Ah, good point.

789
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,780
Well, no, seriously, though, like, you're going to blend in in the night better,

790
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,140
just practically speaking.

791
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:39,740
That's true.

792
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:42,860
My grand puppet always told me the tale of the first black person he saw.

793
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,580
It was just a raincoat in the middle of night walking towards him.

794
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,180
An empty rimmed raincoat.

795
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,940
He was so confused.

796
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,540
Wait, is that a real story?

797
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,460
Oh, yeah, that was an actual story.

798
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:54,140
It scared the shit out of my granddad.

799
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:57,740
A ghost.

800
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,700
Oh, it's a black man.

801
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,980
Oh, they watched the whole Joel Ellie thing go down.

802
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,740
Damn, he dropping them niggas.

803
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,200
Yeah.

804
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,620
Time to use us to your advantage.

805
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,580
And to be fair, Dev, this isn't that racist.

806
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,900
I mean, the black father has yes to abandon his child.

807
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:21,520
Yep.

808
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,180
Where's the mother?

809
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,340
Well, good point.

810
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,620
I think they're brothers, though.

811
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:27,820
I think they're brothers.

812
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,380
So where's the mom, then, and dad?

813
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,980
Yeah, dad, you're digging yourself deeper down the hole.

814
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,220
They were probably like, fed restuges or something.

815
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,140
So they were counter-revolutionaries.

816
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:40,640
Yeah.

817
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:41,840
Damn.

818
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,420
Well, at least the parents had a good reason to run out on them this time, then.

819
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:49,180
See, he did put some outside the door, Kyle, you dumbass.

820
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,140
That was you who said that.

821
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:53,020
No, I didn't.

822
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,060
Hey, that gun's empty.

823
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,540
Oh, my God, child.

824
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,900
Yeah, that gun is empty.

825
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,900
That was interesting.

826
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,260
They still didn't explain enough, though.

827
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,660
You don't have to worry about what to say.

828
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,620
It was better than nothing, but I would have liked a lot more than that.

829
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,500
I want to help you.

830
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,180
I don't know what the next step is with something like this.

831
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,060
If I lower my gun, we didn't hurt you.

832
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,180
So you don't hurt us, right?

833
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,140
That's right.

834
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,340
Oh, Joel's gonna do it anyway.

835
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,220
That's just the way he sounds.

836
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,260
He has an asshole voice.

837
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,220
Joel, tell him he's okay.

838
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,620
Everything is great, dude.

839
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,120
Fuck.

840
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:34,220
Oh, Joel didn't just kill them.

841
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,500
Did he do that in the game?

842
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,140
Did you get these?

843
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,020
No, but how old is he?

844
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:48,880
He's eight.

845
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,320
Cool.

846
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,000
You didn't ask him.

847
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,360
You forgot your brother's age.

848
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,760
He was 14 in the game.

849
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,920
He was 14 before.

850
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,560
There is, like, an Elie quasi-romance, slightly.

851
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,240
To get a view of the city and plan a way out.

852
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,640
And when the sun's up, I'll show you one.

853
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,760
It would be like traveling during the broad daylight, you see.

854
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,680
It's more challenging that way.

855
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,640
It does feel like not a good idea.

856
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:25,760
Oh, here we go.

857
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,480
There's some backstory.

858
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,640
Finally tortured and murdered people for 20 years.

859
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,960
You know what happens when you do that to people?

860
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,600
They become communists.

861
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,800
They do it right back to you.

862
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,320
That's how it follows you here.

863
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,720
I know the city, and that's how I'm going to help you get out.

864
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,600
Also, that city looks very functional, you know?

865
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,920
They clearly, like, have...

866
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,000
They were in a real skylight or whatever,

867
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,040
looking down on the real city that was not apocalyptic.

868
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,800
And they just played it off.

869
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,680
Besides the communist rebels?

870
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,960
Fascist motherfuckers.

871
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,880
Fucking fuck.

872
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,280
They're going to help us escape.

873
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:28,340
Right?

874
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,320
All right.

875
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,920
You'll enlighten your child, would you?

876
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,280
Okay, the more they do this, the more I'm on their side.

877
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,120
It's fucking annoying seeing these retards walking around in broad daylight.

878
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,240
Yeah, I'd do this at night.

879
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,280
We need to get out of sight.

880
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,720
I think it's this way.

881
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,320
Then again, I suppose it's better than House of Dragons,

882
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:59,440
where they shot scenes in broad daylight and then dipped them in editing to be dark.

883
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,960
That's pretty bad, yeah.

884
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,280
Would you like to watch a television show?

885
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,040
Yes, well, fuck you.

886
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,800
It's actually a audiobook.

887
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,280
I thought I told you put that in your rucksack.

888
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,560
It was never paid off.

889
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,040
Yeah, also if there's clickers, like, don't make any noise, dude.

890
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:39,220
Fuck.

891
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,080
I mean, he knows what they are, so he knows that they...

892
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,080
they operate on sound.

893
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:46,960
Like, shut the fuck up.

894
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,960
To be fair, they're walking down a lengthy concrete corridor.

895
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,720
If there was a clicker down there, he'd hear them from hundreds of meters.

896
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,880
Yeah, waddling towards them already.

897
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,680
Yep, because of the way the sound reverberates.

898
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:11,280
Whoa.

899
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,640
Somebody used up a lot of crayons.

900
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,320
Vaults.

901
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,440
Oh, now you noticed.

902
01:01:58,960 --> 01:01:59,760
You fucking...

903
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:05,520
Well, I guess we can wait tonight, this time.

904
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:11,120
You know, I wasn't exactly telling you the truth before.

905
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,240
About me not killing someone.

906
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,120
There was a man, a great man.

907
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:26,560
He was never afraid, never selfish, and he was always forgiving.

908
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:31,520
Have you ever met someone like that?

909
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,760
The kind of man you'd follow anywhere.

910
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,280
I mean, I wanted to, but I would have.

911
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:47,680
Yeah, but Sam, he got sick.

912
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:50,720
Leukemia.

913
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:58,800
Yeah, anyway, there was one drug that worked.

914
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,320
And, whoa, big shock.

915
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,080
There wasn't much left of it, and it belonged to Fedra.

916
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:10,640
And if I wanted something, I was gonna take something big.

917
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,240
So I gave him something big.

918
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,360
That one great man.

919
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,880
The leader of the resistance movement in Kansas City.

920
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,000
A Catholic brother.

921
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,280
Was that in the game?

922
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,080
I'm trying to justify the communist revolution a bit more.

923
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:46,320
Yeah, I think in the game, they were just going after them for leaving.

924
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,960
But being a woman, I was genetically incapable for that.

925
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,800
Where's the justice in that?

926
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,800
What is the point of that?

927
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:14,960
I think it went over her head.

928
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:15,760
He was a great man.

929
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:23,040
We all loved him, but he didn't change anything.

930
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,400
Oh, my God, she's Benito Mussolini.

931
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,400
She was the one who finally brought the revolution.

932
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,040
We're with you.

933
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:35,920
This is Sargon's capital punishment arc right here.

934
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,240
Why should we forgive them?

935
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:38,880
Kill them all.

936
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,160
This is how you do a night scene.

937
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,080
You illuminate it fully, and then you just have some darkness in the background.

938
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,040
I can see things.

939
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,800
I feel like it can't be quite this easy.

940
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,280
Yeah, it wasn't in the game either.

941
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,040
There's gonna be something, I'm sure.

942
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,520
He's like, no, Ellie, never, ever, ever happening.

943
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,840
And then I'm like, I'm going to ask you a million more times.

944
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:17,360
And he's like, oh, recognize the house?

945
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,120
This is the sniper house.

946
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,200
Okay, so there's like an infamously hard level in the game.

947
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:34,080
Where basically you have to go up a straight long street with like a

948
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,480
very accurate sniper killing you the entire way.

949
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:43,920
There's a lot of stealthing and a lot of trying over and over and over again.

950
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,520
Luckily, this guy isn't a particularly good sniper.

951
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,480
If you don't move, he's not going to hit you.

952
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,240
I'm going to go around, try to get in the house through the back, and then I'll take about.

953
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,760
But if you go out there, he's going to kill you.

954
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,120
It's dark, and he has shit aim.

955
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,000
Nobody's going to kill me.

956
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,800
Then he's going to kill us.

957
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,480
Yeah, no, if this guy could aim this, I wouldn't be this much of a problem.

958
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,720
Yeah, Cib Zloth, you recognize it?

959
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,340
Yep.

960
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:18,500
Man, that poor guy.

961
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:23,700
Like, he's practically blind at this point.

962
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:27,700
He's just pulling the trigger, hoping it'll scare them off.

963
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,860
Please don't come over here.

964
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:30,820
These are warning shots.

965
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:31,780
I just don't want to hurt you.

966
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:36,340
Was the mission at night?

967
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,260
No, it was during the day.

968
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,220
That'll bring the day.

969
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:48,660
Maybe your sniper's better in the game because it was daytime.

970
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:58,980
And this is where you unlock the sniper rifle.

971
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:03,700
Oh, no.

972
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:07,780
It was supposed to be the silly sight set, except worse.

973
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,000
Jesus.

974
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:27,220
Joel's also a terrible shot.

975
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:33,940
I think the rifle has been maintained or something, because this is awful.

976
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,780
The scope is fucked.

977
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:36,820
It just jammed.

978
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,700
That's just a shit rifle.

979
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,700
There you go.

980
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,820
That's an awful lot of brown shirts.

981
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,080
Whoa.

982
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,060
He's just a fucking kid.

983
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,740
Well, kids die, Henry.

984
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,300
They die all the time.

985
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:27,220
You think the whole world revolves around him?

986
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:31,140
That he's worth everything?

987
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:36,260
Well, this is what happens when you fuck with fate.

988
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:41,060
Get ready to take him.

989
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:42,660
He's actually a fairly compelling villain.

990
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,160
Yes.

991
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,900
I don't know about that.

992
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,820
The thing is, she sounds like she could be,

993
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,900
but all of this is based on nothing but,

994
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,780
oh, there used to be a guy and he was totally chill,

995
01:08:51,780 --> 01:08:53,220
and so now she's Hitler.

996
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,540
You didn't show that, I think.

997
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:56,420
He was the...

998
01:08:56,420 --> 01:09:00,020
I think what they're doing is he was supposed to be the good guy,

999
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:07,700
but he was also not a radical, but she's the radical and she's horrible,

1000
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:08,740
but she also caused...

1001
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:13,140
Was the able to introduce change.

1002
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,460
Yeah, she was Mussolini.

1003
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:16,580
It was bad change.

1004
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,020
Changes are good.

1005
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:22,020
But this thing like that needed way more cooking,

1006
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:23,620
because right now it's so cliche.

1007
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:26,740
They're trying so hard to make her the complex villain,

1008
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:30,660
but the only reason I have to sympathize for this chick

1009
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:33,780
is that she totally had a brother who was a totally good guy,

1010
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,660
or so I've been told.

1011
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,380
And she's totally doing this for the right reasons,

1012
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:41,380
or so I've been told, because feta were bad,

1013
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:42,580
or so I've been told.

1014
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,500
But we're also sure she's bad though.

1015
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:47,620
Yeah, she's bad.

1016
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:48,500
Hold on, something's going.

1017
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,700
Oh, that's going to be the zombies.

1018
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:54,500
Noise.

1019
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,780
Here comes the zombie cavalry.

1020
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,100
Oh my God.

1021
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:17,460
Yeah, it's time to fucking run.

1022
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,460
Just just no, don't don't huddle that run.

1023
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:25,300
Guys, what the fuck?

1024
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,020
No, don't save them.

1025
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:28,500
Kill them.

1026
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:37,060
No, I want them to kill the bad people with the guns

1027
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:38,980
that are a far larger threat to the children.

1028
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:50,340
God, it's a super zombie.

1029
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,660
Oh my God, what's that thing?

1030
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,540
Yeah, these things are fucking nasty.

1031
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,900
Oh, I didn't think they were going to have bloaters in this,

1032
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,100
because they're so ridiculous.

1033
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:02,740
They're bullshit.

1034
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:03,700
They're bullspongy.

1035
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,780
Well, this one does appear to be bullspongy.

1036
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:12,020
They're going to get their muppets.

1037
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:12,980
Yep.

1038
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:32,340
God, I feel like these villains are so undercooked.

1039
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,380
He killed, they killed Santa Claus,

1040
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:36,660
and that's all I know about him now.

1041
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:42,820
It's a little kid zombie.

1042
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:44,900
That's pretty fucked up.

1043
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:46,580
It's a kid clicker.

1044
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,700
Just shoot it.

1045
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,020
She's out of ammo.

1046
01:11:55,780 --> 01:11:56,980
She can leave her load.

1047
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:00,660
Did she not have one fucking magazine?

1048
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:03,380
No, if the show was brave, they'd kill the child zombie.

1049
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,500
Luckily, Joe became a much better sniper.

1050
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,780
Yeah, I mean, the area's illuminated at least.

1051
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:21,300
Well, he was shooting against the giant truck,

1052
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:22,500
and he was headlights on it.

1053
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,380
It was pretty illuminated.

1054
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:27,380
He never shot his headlight in here.

1055
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:28,900
Yeah, it was heavy.

1056
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,380
Underneath the headlights.

1057
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:41,380
God does not understand how life works.

1058
01:12:55,780 --> 01:13:07,380
All right.

1059
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:13,540
I think they lost.

1060
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:17,380
Yeah, I think it's over for Kansas City.

1061
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:18,020
That's it.

1062
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:18,740
The city's gone.

1063
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:20,580
They deserve that.

1064
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:22,100
That's what they get for being communists.

1065
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:26,500
That's true, but man, I wish that was more of a proper downfall.

1066
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,700
Yeah, that needed like another whole episode to cook.

1067
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:33,460
I think I have a whole but at least 10-20 minutes.

1068
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,500
You think they'll be okay?

1069
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:38,580
Yeah, I think.

1070
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:42,340
It's easier.

1071
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:45,220
Oh, yeah, they've seen plenty of death and destruction in their lives.

1072
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:45,940
We'll be fine.

1073
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:52,420
It just falls asleep.

1074
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,580
So there's one thing I noticed.

1075
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:00,500
These characters, Henry and Sam, they are black in the original game.

1076
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:07,620
And Hollywood's never going to race swap a black character to be white in the adaptation, are they?

1077
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:09,940
Not in the current year.

1078
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:13,380
Given it a few decades.

1079
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:15,460
It always goes one way with that shit.

1080
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:17,300
Of course.

1081
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:22,820
Martin Luther King is Ryan Reynolds.

1082
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:31,300
Oh, no.

1083
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:35,140
Well, time to put them down.

1084
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,540
Oh, don't give him false hope.

1085
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:48,580
Yeah, don't come on.

1086
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:52,500
It's nicer than just take him out back and putting two fucking barrels in him.

1087
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:02,100
Usually like a fucking blood transfusion.

1088
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:10,740
Yeah, no kid is going to be able to do that.

1089
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:13,860
I don't think this is going to work.

1090
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:16,020
I don't think it's going to work, Ellie.

1091
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,820
Just squish your blood right in there.

1092
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:21,700
That'll work, won't it?

1093
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:27,220
Don't worry.

1094
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:29,540
It's the cold thing is that she's trying.

1095
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:35,060
Just magically heals up.

1096
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:35,460
Zoop.

1097
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:44,420
He's like, you're retarded.

1098
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:49,700
Just shoot me.

1099
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:53,940
That kid's dead.

1100
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:54,660
He's fucked.

1101
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:56,040
Yep.

1102
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,100
Oh, very touching.

1103
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:01,300
My character I've known for all of 30, 40 minutes.

1104
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:04,980
Like, she would have tied him to the fucking bed or something.

1105
01:16:04,980 --> 01:16:05,780
Yeah, he's fucked.

1106
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:08,580
Oh, I remember this part of the game.

1107
01:16:09,780 --> 01:16:11,220
It didn't happen in a motel, though.

1108
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:13,620
It happened like in a high rise.

1109
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,300
The worst part is he can feel that.

1110
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:39,300
It happened exactly like that in the game.

1111
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:39,800
Yeah.

1112
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:49,460
Oh, OK.

1113
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,180
Well, I guess I was getting sick of these sidecarriages anyways.

1114
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,620
I mean, that is how their story ended.

1115
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,420
Different location, but same way.

1116
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:02,100
Oh, God, no spicy joke.

1117
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:02,980
Too spicy joke.

1118
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:03,620
Keep it down.

1119
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,260
No, say it.

1120
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:04,820
Say it.

1121
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:05,320
Do it.

1122
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,260
Arch, Arch, do it.

1123
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:11,220
Every time there's black characters, Arch has to make racist jokes.

1124
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:11,780
Do it, Arch.

1125
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:14,100
Because it's funny.

1126
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,780
Arch, it's on my channel.

1127
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:16,180
It's OK.

1128
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:16,660
Go ahead.

1129
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:23,220
That was the first time in a while I actually caught myself and was like,

1130
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:24,340
no, that's a bit too much.

1131
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,620
No, Arch, you have to.

1132
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:30,660
If I tell us what I will truly be canceled.

1133
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:32,340
Joel's been humanized again.

1134
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:32,900
My God.

1135
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:41,220
Ellie is reawakening that human human inside of him.

1136
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:49,940
He's at least taken his jacket.

1137
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,060
Looks like a warm jacket.

1138
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:02,420
There we go.

1139
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:10,420
All right, so right off the bat, I am sounding a bit to the Bill and Frank

1140
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:16,580
romance now because that story felt more important and larger and undercooked.

1141
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,200
Yep.

1142
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:25,460
Especially also to us, like every fucking person in this universe has a horrible ending.

1143
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:28,260
Everyone, everyone they come over has a sad story.

1144
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:34,900
Every one of them gets fucking nuked, except for Bill and Frank, who lives a perfect happy

1145
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:39,380
days drinking wine as their mechanical generator lasts for 20 years.

1146
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:41,140
Yeah.

1147
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:45,780
So you have to remember Bill was a prepper, so.

1148
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:48,900
He was ready.

1149
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:50,820
I think it takes you so far, though.

1150
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:51,380
Absolutely.

1151
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:56,420
But the thing is, like a mechanical generator is going to run you five, ten years if you've

1152
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:57,940
got a good one, that fucking thing.

1153
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:00,580
And that was a massive industrial aggregate, too.

1154
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:00,820
Yep.

1155
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:02,980
It ran without a hitch for 20 years.

1156
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:09,300
So, I mean, you probably traded with Joel and fixed it up.

1157
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:10,340
Yeah.

1158
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:12,180
And fixed shut up during the years.

1159
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:15,540
Joel did mention, like, trading for machine parts.

1160
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:20,980
It can be assumed that this was a part of that, because you don't need to explain everything

1161
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:21,540
in a show.

1162
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:23,620
Nobody cares about it.

1163
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:25,220
It's not that it's explaining anything.

1164
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:27,860
It's that you have two characters who live a perfectly happy life.

1165
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:28,980
Everything is abundance.

1166
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,020
The fuel is still running.

1167
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,180
They've got they don't just have food.

1168
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:36,740
They have fresh lamb chops with wine and strawberries.

1169
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:37,540
Yeah.

1170
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:38,820
And strawberries.

1171
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:41,780
If I could have had the grew those, that's less ridiculous.

1172
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:43,140
So here's the thing.

1173
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:47,940
Meanwhile, everyone else is living in squalor and dirt and they're filthy and they get to

1174
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:50,420
live for about 10 minutes per episode.

1175
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:51,220
Yep.

1176
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,900
So, Arch, here's the situation.

1177
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:53,460
Okay.

1178
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,660
The Last of Us is well, it's a travel story, right?

1179
01:19:56,660 --> 01:20:01,380
So they can't stick around in one town for too long to really see the rise and fall of,

1180
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:05,620
like, a big political faction because they spend the entire game on the road.

1181
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:09,780
And so you have to, like, get the backstory through through logs and stuff.

1182
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:11,540
Doesn't translate over to a TV.

1183
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:19,300
However, every single person that Joel and Ellie come across meet a horrific death in

1184
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:20,020
the game.

1185
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:24,260
That's why, you know, Frank kills himself and Bill is bitter and alone.

1186
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:24,900
Except for Bill.

1187
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:27,380
Yeah, but Bill goes off.

1188
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:29,700
Bill needs a pretty fucking horrific end, too.

1189
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:33,060
And then his life companion fucking hangs himself.

1190
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:37,300
Every person that you meet and while going through the game, The Last of Us, they all

1191
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,940
meet, like, a terrible end of some type.

1192
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,540
It's always a terrible end.

1193
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,620
And that's kind of the point is, like, Joel.

1194
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:47,460
I mean, I'll spoil a little bit more for you, Arch, if you don't mind.

1195
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:54,900
Joel's actions as you go through the game become increasingly violent and erratic in

1196
01:20:54,900 --> 01:21:00,340
the service of keeping Ellie alive to the point that, like, every single wander they

1197
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:03,620
come across just, like, meets a terrible, meets a terrible fate.

1198
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:06,500
That's the point of the show is, like, how far Joel is willing to go for this girl.

1199
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:08,980
And so you can make a story out of that.

1200
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:09,780
Fair enough.

1201
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:15,940
And you are kind of correct in that whole thing.

1202
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:20,820
If they're going to do that story, they kind of ruined it by giving the gay couple a happy

1203
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:21,300
ending.

1204
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,820
I wouldn't go so far as to say ruined.

1205
01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:30,180
It just feels more unfitting after seeing this.

1206
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:35,860
Like, it fits worse because if they have an entire episode to dedicate to that, then this

1207
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:38,580
was a larger and more important set of events.

1208
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:41,620
Well, there are two episodes for this one.

1209
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:48,260
And so far, I don't think they've ever really dedicated more than one episode on any sort

1210
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:49,540
of given topic.

1211
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:50,660
Because that's true.

1212
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:50,900
Yeah.

1213
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:54,580
Episode one is the establishment thing.

1214
01:21:55,300 --> 01:22:00,980
And episode two was the start of the journey and also Tess's death.

1215
01:22:01,860 --> 01:22:11,300
And episode three was about Bill and Frank, and episode four and five are with this new

1216
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:11,700
group.

1217
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:16,420
So they've actually had two episodes dedicated to this particular group.

1218
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:23,940
And I think for what they showed, and for the pacing and overall taking in the overall

1219
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:28,420
broader pacing, I think they did fine with what they got.

1220
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:35,220
I think since everything else only had one episode and this one had two, I feel like

1221
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:42,260
doing three on this one would have stretched this beyond just a stop gap and made it into

1222
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,620
an entire arc.

1223
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,540
And this was sort of like a mini-arc.

1224
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,060
And I think for what it is, it's fine.

1225
01:22:49,060 --> 01:22:58,100
But if you were more used to, say, The Walking Dead, the pacing from that, if this were

1226
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:01,300
Walking Dead, they would dedicate an entire season on this.

1227
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:05,060
Because Walking Dead numerously did that.

1228
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:16,820
When they would encounter a new group of people that will try to kill a main group, they'll

1229
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:24,260
usually have an interesting or overarching villain as the leader.

1230
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:31,300
And they'll have several episodes dedicated towards learning the backstory and what came

1231
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:36,180
of the group that they are now in opposition to the main group.

1232
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:45,460
And I feel like if you're used to that, then you could take a look at this and be like,

1233
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:47,460
oh, well, they didn't spend enough time on it.

1234
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:54,500
And yeah, it would be nice to spend more time with learning about that stuff.

1235
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:59,620
But I don't think it would fit this pacing of the skill that they're going with and the

1236
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:05,220
theme of just moving from one direction to another, because it's all about transporting

1237
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:06,340
Ellie throughout.

1238
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:10,900
Well, that's kind of the point, because all of the other episodes have been about Joel

1239
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,020
and Ellie.

1240
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:16,500
And then you have one episode which has nothing to do with them, which is a complete sidetrack,

1241
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:22,420
and then they don't do that for this group, which is this is a more important story element

1242
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:27,460
in their journey, which means the Bill and Frank episode feels way more out of place.

1243
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:32,020
It feels like it was put in there and it doesn't fit in with the rest of the show.

1244
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:36,980
If they had done more on this group, too, I would have been like, OK, they're clearly

1245
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:43,060
going for more of a grand scenery surrounding them rather than just the traveler story.

1246
01:24:43,060 --> 01:24:48,500
Instead, you have the travel story that stops for one episode and then resumes after that

1247
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,460
again, because I absolutely understand that none of the characters get to live, because

1248
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,140
as you said, it's the traveler story.

1249
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:57,140
And so annoying side characters need to be shooed out of the way one way or another.

1250
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,420
Well, I think I know I think I know what you're saying.

1251
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:05,940
It's something like it's something like you can have a story where you're going from place

1252
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:08,900
to place rapidly and you don't get everything.

1253
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:13,300
And the and the villains of the day kind of have to be handled in that episode or soon

1254
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:20,340
after, or you can have a story where like every time Joel bumps into a new group, we

1255
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:25,060
get like an entire flashback build up of what they went through.

1256
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:31,300
So in that in that in that type of story, each episode or like maybe each arc of the

1257
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:37,380
show, it it becomes like Joel's journey becomes like a frame story with all these other

1258
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:40,180
stories happening inside of the frame.

1259
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:42,820
You could do that, but but you can't do both of them.

1260
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:49,060
You can't have one episode focus exclusively on Bill and Frank and then not give the next

1261
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,460
group just as much focus, which they didn't.

1262
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,980
And I think I think that's what we're going to do.

1263
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:56,180
Yes, that's that's my point.

1264
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,980
So I decided to look this up real quick just just to get some numbers behind this.

1265
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:05,540
So I looked at the Last of Us season one critical reception by episode on Rotten Tomatoes.

1266
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:09,780
So all the episodes are still considered good, by the way.

1267
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:13,700
But episode one has critical reception 100 percent.

1268
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:20,980
It is like 97 percent per episode to 98 percent for episode three, 100 percent for episode

1269
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:24,420
four and 90 percent for episode five.

1270
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:30,340
So people still overwhelmingly loved this, but it dropped down 10 percentage points episode

1271
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,460
five compared to the other four.

1272
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:36,660
And I think that's because that final villain at the end there, the woman just didn't have

1273
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:41,700
enough time to like really get established and like there's only a couple of establishing

1274
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:42,260
scenes with her.

1275
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:46,180
There was the scene where she's talking to the doctor and then there's the scene where

1276
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:49,940
she's in her childhood, her childhood bedroom.

1277
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:55,140
And those are the only real character focused scenes on her to make her a compelling villain

1278
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:55,780
for the audience.

1279
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:56,900
And it just didn't work.

1280
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:01,380
There wasn't the one thing the one thing we can definitely see here is the translation

1281
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:05,780
from video game media, interactive media to TV show.

1282
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:09,300
And this is where the video games able to do it better because better use of pacing,

1283
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:12,420
better use of exploration and visual storytelling through exploration.

1284
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:16,420
The show has no such luxuries to do these things.

1285
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:20,180
You can't overhear dialogue as they sneak through because they can only do like maybe

1286
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:23,460
a sneak thing for like one or one section of the show.

1287
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:24,820
And it wouldn't be very good at that.

1288
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:29,780
So you can see that the story doesn't translate very well.

1289
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:34,100
And especially when they're trying to somewhat remain faithful to it.

1290
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:38,180
So that's going to become a bigger issue, I think, as we get further and further into

1291
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:38,580
the show.

1292
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:45,140
I don't know if it's that because it's not that this story can't translate.

1293
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:47,460
It's that they didn't give it enough time to translate.

1294
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:53,780
Well, certain sections will not translate without them completely reframing and reworking

1295
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:54,260
things.

1296
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:58,500
They've already reworked quite a bit because of the whole like seeing like the bad guy

1297
01:27:58,500 --> 01:27:59,540
perspective thing.

1298
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:00,500
That's completely new.

1299
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:06,260
Like you don't really see them a lot because, you know, you're following this perspective.

1300
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:10,180
Of course, but that's them simulating the audio logs, essentially.

1301
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:11,940
That's the bad guy perspective.

1302
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:12,820
That's the audio logs.

1303
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:14,020
That's the bad guy perspective.

1304
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:19,300
But the audio logs leave a little bit more vague, especially when they actually talk

1305
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:21,460
about the bad guys and all the things they're doing.

1306
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:25,460
And it's not more so like, I don't know.

1307
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:30,900
It's hard to describe because if you play the game, it was just you escaping with Harry

1308
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:31,780
and Sam, right?

1309
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:32,580
Yeah.

1310
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:33,380
Yeah.

1311
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:40,260
There's no particular like I think that woman was mostly like a background character, I

1312
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:40,740
think.

1313
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:41,240
Yeah.

1314
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:44,100
Written for like the movie.

1315
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,740
I mean, the show was big.

1316
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:49,940
Yeah, she was like only mention logs, I think, actually in the game.

1317
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:54,340
They expanded it out a bit, but they didn't do anything with the expansion like in the

1318
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:59,060
you stealth and fight your way through the city in the game.

1319
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:00,980
And then you make it to like Sniper's Alley.

1320
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:03,060
Then you get out of Sniper's Alley, you just move on.

1321
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:06,100
I don't even think there was like a big rush of infected at that point.

1322
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:10,180
I think that was in our episode on this group.

1323
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:12,100
They completely reworked that whole section.

1324
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,020
That was not faithful to the game at all.

1325
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:15,380
Oh, speaking of that.

1326
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:16,100
Okay.

1327
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:18,420
What did you think of the first appearance of the bloater?

1328
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:22,020
A stupid video game monster.

1329
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:23,700
Yeah, kind of.

1330
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:29,220
It's not as cool because what it should have been as the bloater should be fighting like

1331
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:30,020
Joel and Ellie.

1332
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:31,940
And it could be like a really tense moment.

1333
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:38,820
Like, I don't know, the bloater has always been scarier in the game because when it attacked

1334
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:41,380
you, you're like, fuck, not that piece of shit again.

1335
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:44,340
Like he eats bullets like nobody's business.

1336
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:49,140
And he's really just kind of cancerous to deal with because he murders you pretty easily.

1337
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:52,020
Yeah, it's got the corner.

1338
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:56,340
It's not as intimidating when he's attacking the bad guys.

1339
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:56,980
Yeah.

1340
01:29:56,980 --> 01:30:02,260
So, Arch, I'm sure you've intuited this already, but the bloater is the stage after the clicker

1341
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:03,860
and the stage before you become a big mushroom.

1342
01:30:05,860 --> 01:30:08,500
And you can run around and like spread spores as a bloater.

1343
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:09,860
You can just spit spores everywhere.

1344
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:14,260
And he's really annoying to deal with in the game because he's very bullet spongy.

1345
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:17,940
However, he has like an insta-kill attack, but just by infecting you with a bunch of

1346
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:18,900
spores if you get close.

1347
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:25,460
Um, they were always, even in the game, they were always more annoying than scary.

1348
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:28,660
Clickers were always scarier because you had to stealth them.

1349
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,100
You can't stealth a bloater.

1350
01:30:30,100 --> 01:30:31,620
They're always like a boss fight, you know?

1351
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,900
Yeah, the bloater was the quote unquote boss of the universe.

1352
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,740
Like Dead Space had the invincible necromorph.

1353
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:38,100
This had the bloaters.

1354
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:41,460
Like they're there to try to drive up tension.

1355
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:46,580
But if you get caught on a section like that, that can, you know, the tilt factor starts

1356
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:47,220
to rise.

1357
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:48,020
Oh, that's the thing.

1358
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:54,020
Any monster that is described as annoying or frustrating is not a scary monster.

1359
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:57,460
It's a video game mechanic that you recognize as a video game mechanic.

1360
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:57,960
Yep.

1361
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,780
It's all about raising tension and how you execute that.

1362
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:02,340
And you know what?

1363
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:05,940
It's the example of the fucking alien from, uh, from aliens video game.

1364
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:09,860
The sooner, the moment you realize it's a fucking video game mechanic, it ceases being

1365
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:10,820
scary.

1366
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:11,140
Yeah.

1367
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:11,380
Yeah.

1368
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:15,540
And isolation is really bad that where you just like, you can tell how the AI director

1369
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:16,020
works on it.

1370
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:16,900
This isn't scary.

1371
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:18,420
It just runs circles around me.

1372
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:25,220
So, uh, compare the introduction of the bloater in this episode, which is it runs, it comes

1373
01:31:25,220 --> 01:31:30,180
out of the hole in the ground and there's like a, you know, uh, uh, uh, a soundtrack

1374
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:32,260
that makes it sound like it's going to be a big fight.

1375
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:35,140
And then he starts like beating up people and he's like ripping people's heads off.

1376
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:39,140
And I mean, it's cool and gory, but it's not scary.

1377
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:45,140
Now compare that to, um, to the introduction of the clicker back in episode two where they're

1378
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:49,620
all like extremely quiet for multiple minutes and they're just like, shut the fuck up.

1379
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:50,980
This is extremely scary.

1380
01:31:50,980 --> 01:31:52,340
And they're tiptoeing around.

1381
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:57,620
And then when it finally shows up, they're like, it was significantly, the clicker's

1382
01:31:57,620 --> 01:31:59,780
introduction was significantly better.

1383
01:31:59,780 --> 01:32:00,100
Yep.

1384
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,700
They did better job of tension.

1385
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:05,220
What they should have done with the bloaters, the bloaters shouldn't be there to save them

1386
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:06,500
like from the bad guys.

1387
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:07,540
That's stupid.

1388
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:11,140
The bloaters should be this thing they bump into, but it can't quite get them because

1389
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:13,220
of its large bloated body.

1390
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:17,300
But you are quickly figuring out very, you know, just through this audio that have been

1391
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:22,260
moving around that it's, it's something big, it's something threatening and you start to

1392
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:23,220
generate tension.

1393
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:26,020
This didn't generate tension because it sort of came out of the ground.

1394
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:32,100
I was like, there's also the problem that what it did have was it had no payoff effect.

1395
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:32,340
Okay.

1396
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:34,180
So we'd kill Santa Claus.

1397
01:32:34,180 --> 01:32:36,820
And I don't know who the fuck Santa Claus is.

1398
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:37,940
He's just a dude.

1399
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:43,060
And he's with the woman who is vastly oversold as some kind of villain.

1400
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:48,100
And then she's killed by a zombie thing like, there's no payoff there.

1401
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:50,340
It's just, it's just randos getting killed.

1402
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:53,860
And the show shows it as if you're supposed to give a fuck.

1403
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:55,380
It's like, oh no, Santa Claus.

1404
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:58,660
I don't think you're supposed to be sad about it.

1405
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:00,500
Well, no, you're supposed to care.

1406
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,820
You're supposed to be like, yeah, he killed Santa Claus.

1407
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:03,860
He was a bad person.

1408
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:07,460
I don't necessarily think so.

1409
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:14,100
I think like they were trying to portray the group as like a bit mixed, like a bit extreme,

1410
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:20,340
but I don't think like, I also think like Santa Claus looked like a bit remorseful or

1411
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:22,660
questions if he was doing the right thing at the point.

1412
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:27,700
Yeah, they tried to, he was like, no, no, you, you woman, you gave us the thing.

1413
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:29,460
We kill all these people and we're behind you.

1414
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:31,060
Like, I don't think he had any remorse.

1415
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:34,340
If anything, I think he was annoyed that this wasn't the plan of the great leader.

1416
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:40,420
I think he was like a bit, felt a bit conflicted because he felt like the woman was a bit extremist.

1417
01:33:41,940 --> 01:33:43,060
I don't agree with you.

1418
01:33:43,060 --> 01:33:48,260
And the reason I don't is because there was that one section where he asked, we're not

1419
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:49,460
giving them a trial, are we?

1420
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:50,260
And she's like, no.

1421
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:53,380
And he just goes, like, he seemed to be on board.

1422
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:54,260
He seemed to be on board.

1423
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:55,780
Fair enough.

1424
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:56,740
But I don't know.

1425
01:33:56,740 --> 01:34:00,020
They could have given them more characterization.

1426
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:07,300
I think they were also like mostly like back way more in the background in the game too.

1427
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:13,380
So they still only had like, they had to pretty much write entirely new characters, I guess.

1428
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:17,860
And that's kind of the thing there, because I wouldn't be anywhere near as annoyed by

1429
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:23,940
this if they didn't try to sell them so hard, if they were just like background character

1430
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:27,300
and it was alluded to that they had done something horrible, like, okay, fine.

1431
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:29,140
It's a traveler story again.

1432
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:31,300
But they tried to sell them.

1433
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:34,020
Like they tried to be like, oh, there's a complex story here.

1434
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:36,740
Necessarily think they tried to sell them.

1435
01:34:36,740 --> 01:34:44,740
They think they more of that just like gave them more filling as opposed to just like,

1436
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:49,700
oh, these are bandits and they steal and rape and shit.

1437
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:54,820
I mean, they dedicated several scenes to like building up the reason why she did this, to

1438
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:57,140
try and make her sympathetic yet still evil.

1439
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:58,980
Yeah, it didn't work.

1440
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:02,580
They needed either more time with them or less, I think.

1441
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:04,180
Yes, either more or less.

1442
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:05,540
One of the two.

1443
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:07,460
Fair enough.

1444
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:10,900
I thought what I thought there was fine for the most part.

1445
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:13,060
It could have used a bit more, but.

1446
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:18,420
And to be fair, Lilith, they did say on Rotten Tomatoes that this scored a 90% audience approval

1447
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:20,500
rating, which is less than the hundred average.

1448
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,580
But still, I mean, 90 is pretty high.

1449
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:27,300
So it's like it's this is still a liked episode.

1450
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:28,500
It's still a like show.

1451
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:30,260
People are still really enjoying this.

1452
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:34,900
It seems it's just that this I think even the people who like the show recognize that

1453
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:37,540
this is probably the worst episode of the five so far.

1454
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:40,900
I don't know if this if this show deserves even even a 90.

1455
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:43,620
Like it's a good show, but it's not like 100% good.

1456
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:46,980
No, no, it's the modern day.

1457
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:50,580
Everything now is either a train wreck or a masterpiece.

1458
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:56,900
It's this I miss the good old days where if a show got a six, you're like above average.

1459
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:57,780
I might check that out.

1460
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:00,500
I don't remember those days.

1461
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,340
I remember seeing a six and be like trash.

1462
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:04,580
That's because you're a fetus.

1463
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:10,020
I remember the good old days of the PC gaming magazines where a six meant above average.

1464
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:13,140
Arch believing games journos caught now live.

1465
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:16,660
Can you believe that guilt?

1466
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:22,020
Like I remember fucking the only like super high scores that they used to give out there

1467
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,620
was like for the really one.

1468
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:25,700
It's like Diablo got like a nine.

1469
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,220
Sacrifice got like a 10.

1470
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:30,900
You know, the big companies that had the big paychecks here.

1471
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:40,500
Well, I don't know if any of you three remember this, but back in 2006.

1472
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:45,140
All right, back in 2006 on 4chan's video game board.

1473
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:49,060
When when it was either IGN or GameSpot.

1474
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:54,340
Gave a Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess an 8.8 out of 10.

1475
01:36:55,140 --> 01:37:00,740
That was considered like a fucking high crime against gaming to give a Zelda title less

1476
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:05,460
than a nine and like 8.8 became a meme for years.

1477
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:08,340
You know, it's probably worth it.

1478
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:10,660
Honestly, it's probably it's probably about 8.8 to be honest.

1479
01:37:10,660 --> 01:37:19,540
Though we need to be returning to the numerical score system had a purpose and a point, but

1480
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:23,300
it has long since lost that purpose because now everything is either a one or a 10.

1481
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:24,100
Yeah.

1482
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:26,340
And they're just quibbling around degrees.

1483
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:31,380
Like five is meant to be average in the numerical score system, but no one uses it that way,

1484
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:31,620
right?

1485
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:36,420
Like if you especially if you're like talking about, you know, let's say like someone's

1486
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:37,700
attractiveness, right?

1487
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,820
If you say someone's a four out of 10 or a five out of 10, that's like saying there

1488
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:41,220
is zero.

1489
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:44,900
And if you if you say someone there, someone is like an eight out of 10.

1490
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:45,940
That's like saying there are 10.

1491
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:51,060
So it does seem like the whole numbers thing has kind of fallen apart in recent years.

1492
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:56,020
Have we said all we want to say about The Last of Us episodes four and five?

1493
01:37:56,980 --> 01:37:58,500
Yeah, yep.

1494
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:00,420
Yep, I think so too.

1495
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:05,940
Next week, we should be able to do things normally again, because unless Archie have

1496
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:07,700
some more IRL things happening.

1497
01:38:08,660 --> 01:38:10,100
No, I'm good next week.

1498
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:10,820
Very good.

1499
01:38:10,820 --> 01:38:13,380
So no more Super Bowl, no more.

1500
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:20,260
I think everything should be fine unless like some some drastic event happens, which I

1501
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:22,820
mean probably will happen, to be honest, knowing our luck.

1502
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:25,860
But hopefully we'll all be here for next week.

1503
01:38:27,220 --> 01:38:27,860
That's okay.

1504
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:31,700
The Redskins won, by the way.

1505
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,220
They're still called the Redskins.

1506
01:38:34,180 --> 01:38:36,260
They're called the Chiefs now, which is not much better.

1507
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:40,580
Damn, it's not as based.
