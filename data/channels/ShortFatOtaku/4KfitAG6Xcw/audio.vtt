00:00.000 --> 00:09.040
Hello, everyone. Welcome back to us watching The Last of Us. This will be episodes four

00:09.040 --> 00:13.840
and five. We missed a few. So it turns out, Lilith, that you couldn't make it for episode

00:13.840 --> 00:17.760
three due to some IRL shenanigans. So you got all caught up.

00:17.760 --> 00:22.680
Yep. I watched episode three, actually just today.

00:22.680 --> 00:30.920
And then episodes, basically, we missed episode four, because Arch, you had some sort of IRL

00:30.920 --> 00:33.000
stuff to do with your job, right? You couldn't be around?

00:34.280 --> 00:37.720
I was occupied, oh yes, I had to get up super early in the morning,

00:37.720 --> 00:39.800
and I would have gotten about two hours of sleep.

00:42.680 --> 00:48.040
And episode five, it turns out, actually came out a couple of days ago, but because it was,

00:48.040 --> 00:53.640
it was preempted because tonight is the Super Bowl. And in fact, my IRL friends are off watching

00:53.640 --> 00:59.480
the Super Bowl, and I'm a nerd, recluse, and I don't care about sports ball, so I'm here

00:59.480 --> 01:03.880
watching The Last of Us with you guys. Let's talk about the sports ball. So as far

01:03.880 --> 01:07.640
as I understand, there's a racist team against a group of birds.

01:08.520 --> 01:13.320
Oh, is that how it is? Is it the Redskins or whatever? I don't know the teams.

01:13.320 --> 01:21.240
One is called the Chiefs. I don't think they're Native Americans though, so that's really racist.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.560
Yeah, because Arch, you're Norwegian, you don't really care about American hand egg.

01:25.560 --> 01:31.800
And Lilith, you never seem like a sporty type to me. But Kibbs, you live in the American

01:31.800 --> 01:37.800
heartland. How are you not watching sports ball like your brothers?

01:37.800 --> 01:47.720
Sports boring. Well, there we go. He has a, he has a personal trauma with the hand egg.

01:47.720 --> 01:53.480
So, oh, really can't watch it anymore. What's the story? What's the story? It fell on me in school.

01:53.480 --> 02:00.280
I broke my collarbone. Is that true? That did. But that wasn't the reason why I don't watch sports.

02:00.280 --> 02:06.520
I just, I don't like watching. Like, I, I like to play. No, I'm kind of the same much better reason

02:06.520 --> 02:12.280
though. Like if, you know, you see the sports ball and you just imagine the enormous tuckas

02:12.280 --> 02:19.640
coming towards you. No, it was his knee. And it would, like, it's not the, it's not the hands.

02:19.640 --> 02:24.680
Well, here Kibbs, you know what? I, next time we play sports, I'll fall on you just,

02:24.680 --> 02:27.960
just to round it out, okay? Devil, shoot you if you do that.

02:29.640 --> 02:32.680
If I can, you know, move my arms, assuming, because what breaks.

02:33.240 --> 02:39.080
Thanks. So we're, we're going to watch episodes four and five today. And, but first Lilith,

02:39.880 --> 02:46.360
you wanted to give your take on episode three since, you know, a brief take because

02:46.360 --> 02:51.160
you, you weren't here last time. Yeah, I thought it was pretty well handled. Like,

02:51.800 --> 02:57.320
they depicted a libertarian character and who was like, libertarian representation.

02:58.040 --> 03:02.760
Yes, libertarian representation with the don't tread on me and everything. And,

03:03.640 --> 03:08.280
which is to be expected if you play like the game. Well, if you're familiar with the Bill character

03:08.280 --> 03:15.160
who helps out Joel and Ellie and anyways, who's just basically like a prepper and a handyman

03:15.160 --> 03:21.320
and can build all sorts of traps and resulted in one of the more memorable scenes in the game,

03:21.320 --> 03:27.560
where it's like, Joel's just hung upside down by the leg and has to shoot zombies while Ellie gets

03:27.560 --> 03:32.680
him down. Oh, that part was actually quite hard. I remember being very frustrated playing that

03:32.680 --> 03:35.560
because like your controls are fucking inverted. Jesus.

03:37.240 --> 03:41.000
You've got libertarians here, you've got gun-toting zero immigration

03:41.000 --> 03:44.200
fucking build a fence now. It's like, that's woke. Is it?

03:44.200 --> 03:55.080
It's about as chat as they get if, if only Frank was like a woman and like, it's like

03:55.080 --> 04:01.400
perfect picturesque married couple living together, supporting each other and make,

04:01.400 --> 04:07.800
making sure enriching each other's lives and having a homestead and harming and all that

04:07.800 --> 04:15.080
trat stuff, but they don't like it because Frank is a man who speaks in gay or the crossing sword.

04:16.760 --> 04:23.640
And like the, the actual like radical left gay stereotype are the people who are like

04:24.280 --> 04:29.640
pissing all over each other on the pride float with, with children watching. And it's like,

04:29.640 --> 04:35.240
that's not what these guys are about. You know? Yeah. The thing is, if you were to change,

04:35.240 --> 04:39.240
if we were to go back change, the fact that it's not the last was take the same story arc

04:39.240 --> 04:43.240
and literally change one of the characters into a girl. I guarantee you there's other people at

04:43.240 --> 04:48.200
base to be speech. Like that's all that no one would have any problem with it. And that's okay.

04:48.200 --> 04:52.680
So the director guy was like, Oh, I put the gay in there. It's like a trick. I fed it to you in

04:52.680 --> 04:57.560
the brownie. I don't care. Like I've never been an opposition to gay people. And you've just

04:57.560 --> 05:03.000
presented me with a perfectly fine conservative romance. Like, yup. You didn't trick me into

05:03.000 --> 05:06.840
anything. You checked yourself, bro. They didn't really change anything. It's like,

05:06.840 --> 05:13.240
uh, bill is gay in the game. Like, uh, the only difference was, uh, they changed the ending. Yeah.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.960
This one, they had a happy ending where they didn't get separated.

05:17.000 --> 05:24.120
Literally the only point of quote unquote propaganda is that it's a hyper idealized ending

05:24.120 --> 05:27.640
and it is like all of their machinery is working. They still have fuel. They still have

05:27.640 --> 05:32.520
fancy dinners. They still have fucking wine. Like, um, I was really surprised when they,

05:32.520 --> 05:39.000
when they cast, uh, Nick Offerman as the, uh, libertarian survivalist bill, by the way,

05:39.000 --> 05:45.320
it was like, that's like the perfect fricking casting because, uh, Ron Swanson and just like

05:45.320 --> 05:50.040
the most memeable libertarian character in television. I watched it again with Naomi,

05:50.040 --> 05:53.880
right? Cause she wanted to see the episode too. And it was a good episode. So I didn't

05:53.960 --> 05:57.640
mind watching it again. And I noticed something subtle about it. I didn't notice the first time

05:57.640 --> 06:05.800
through. Um, when you see bill, like, you know, before he meets up with Frank, you know, there's

06:05.800 --> 06:09.800
the army's going around clearing out all the houses and he's, he's in his bunker and he's like

06:10.520 --> 06:14.280
new world order fucks, w E F motherfucker. You're not going to get me out of here.

06:14.280 --> 06:21.560
He seemed like your average, you know, off the grid Republican voter at the start of the, um,

06:21.640 --> 06:27.000
at the start of his story, he's like, you know, he's, he's hiding, he's, he's, he's very handy.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.520
He's doing things for himself. He doesn't care about other, he doesn't care so much about our

06:30.520 --> 06:35.000
society. You know, he's, he's keeping to himself. He's, he's building up his compound. Um, he's

06:35.000 --> 06:39.960
happy that other people are gone. And however, he also seems like in after watching it the second

06:39.960 --> 06:45.880
time, he's probably closeted gay, you know, and then when Frank comes along and he realizes that

06:45.880 --> 06:52.520
Frank is also gay, that moment when they're both in bed, they're both lying in bed. And Frank asks

06:52.520 --> 06:57.160
him, have you ever had sex with another man before? And he nervously says no, only with a

06:57.160 --> 07:03.800
girl. Once when I was younger, it seemed to me that bill was like, probably closeted, probably

07:03.800 --> 07:09.880
a little bit homophobic, but now that society's fallen apart, he can basically do whatever he

07:09.880 --> 07:15.800
wants without being judged by whoever was around him before. And so he's taking this chance with

07:15.800 --> 07:22.360
Frank. There basically can't be a more pro gay story than that of a guy coming out of the closet

07:23.240 --> 07:26.360
after years of repression and then finding a romance.

07:26.360 --> 07:30.840
Apparently Ben Shapiro got super duper pissed off about Bill and Frank.

07:30.840 --> 07:35.640
Oh, yes. That's one thing we should talk about real quick. So Arch, last episode, you basically

07:35.640 --> 07:40.200
said that this was a good romance and I think you repeated it today. It was a good romance.

07:40.200 --> 07:44.920
It was a good representation of a positive representation of a conservative gay romance.

07:44.920 --> 07:49.240
And in fact, Arch, I think you, you milked this topic on your channel for all it was worth. You

07:49.240 --> 07:53.800
did like three videos on how the right should be claiming Bill and Frank. Is that, is that correct?

07:53.800 --> 07:54.040
No.

07:55.240 --> 07:55.800
Milked.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.520
You squeezed.

07:56.520 --> 08:03.880
That's not really, this turned into a controversy is not really the right word because there were

08:03.880 --> 08:08.120
people who disagreed with my take on this. And I think it is because we are too used to being

08:08.120 --> 08:11.800
defensive. We have to be against things because we have to counter the woke. But

08:11.800 --> 08:17.800
again, the thing is, if you did this romance and you made Frank into a big breasted blonde woman,

08:17.800 --> 08:22.120
nobody would have any problems with this at all. And, you know, it wouldn't be an issue.

08:22.840 --> 08:27.640
If anything, the only complaint would be the same that I have, that it was overly idealized

08:27.640 --> 08:32.840
and that they had no problems whatsoever. Really. There's like one raid that was easily repelled by

08:32.840 --> 08:37.800
the electrified fucking fence. I do think the right should be claiming these characters because

08:37.800 --> 08:43.240
they are clearly hashtag our side. So to say these, these are libertarians. They are not woke.

08:43.240 --> 08:48.920
They don't seem there was, how do I put it? Like at no point did they bring in politics into their

08:48.920 --> 08:55.080
relationship. They didn't sit around the table going like, Oh, I was pressed under a patriarchy

08:55.080 --> 09:00.200
or anything like that. It was just two people who fell in love and I don't see anything wrong with

09:00.200 --> 09:05.320
that. So you sent me a little Twitter post from some breadtuber who was like, Oh God, I can't

09:05.320 --> 09:10.040
wait for the conservatives to see this. They'll be seething and molding. This is exactly why we

09:10.040 --> 09:18.360
should be claiming these two characters because nothing would piss the workers off more than

09:18.360 --> 09:26.120
having the, cause they've owned the identity of gay now for 20 years and they've used it as a

09:26.120 --> 09:30.360
political tool. Taking it away from them has got to be the funniest thing we could possibly do.

09:30.520 --> 09:36.920
So what you're talking about arch is that a Xander hall made this post me watching Nick Offerman get

09:36.920 --> 09:42.120
a blow job for another man in the last of us and imagining the reaction of the chud YouTubers who

09:42.120 --> 09:48.600
have to watch the scene to review the episode. Now, firstly, like this is Xander hall, dude,

09:48.600 --> 09:53.080
you got to stop thinking you got to unplug from the culture, the culture war. Okay. Because you

09:53.080 --> 09:57.800
probably shouldn't be thinking about like, you're gonna sit down with your girlfriend or with your

09:57.800 --> 10:01.240
friends or whoever with your discord, whoever you're gonna sit down and watch a wholesome

10:01.240 --> 10:07.240
hour of TV, have a good time. And what you're thinking of is, man, I bet the people that I

10:07.240 --> 10:11.480
hate on the internet are mad right now. It's like, Jesus Christ, dude, Xander hall, what the fuck?

10:11.480 --> 10:15.160
You gotta, you gotta like turn off the internet and put down the bong or something like Christ.

10:16.120 --> 10:20.280
See, I don't know what a Xander hall is. So I don't know the context here, but

10:20.280 --> 10:25.480
uh, okay. Listen, listen arch. I presume he's a communist judging by

10:26.040 --> 10:33.000
Vash with minus 20 IQ points and too much weed. That's Andrew. So in reply to Xander hall,

10:33.000 --> 10:40.600
there was one guy named comrade giga Chad. He, him who says, surprisingly, they don't hate it.

10:40.600 --> 10:46.760
At least this one doesn't. And then links your video arch. It links your video.

10:46.760 --> 10:51.160
And then somebody else responded to like, it makes me worried. What are they getting out of it? I'm

10:51.160 --> 10:55.400
like, it's just two conservatives having a romance. That's all I'm getting out of it.

10:55.960 --> 11:01.080
See, I'm going to do a video on this, right? Because at some point I'll do a video. I have

11:01.080 --> 11:07.000
to flush this out a little bit, a little bit more, but basically the right knows what the left looks

11:07.000 --> 11:12.760
like from the point of view of being inside the left, but the left has no clue what the right

11:12.760 --> 11:17.320
looks like from being, from the point of view of being inside the right. And there's a clear,

11:17.320 --> 11:20.680
there's a clear like imbalance there between the knowledge of each other.

11:21.480 --> 11:27.320
And that's why I think we're seeing stuff like this of why does a right winger like arch Warhammer

11:27.320 --> 11:32.280
like a con like a gay romance? And it's like, Hmm, maybe you need to reevaluate how you view

11:32.280 --> 11:36.680
the fucking world dude. But well, actually, that's an interesting idea you have there.

11:36.680 --> 11:41.640
Cause I hadn't thought about that. I've seen, I figured that they would be able to,

11:42.600 --> 11:48.440
how do I put this? Like all the shit that people say about me, I figured they were just lying

11:48.440 --> 11:53.480
because it seemed like a good attack angle, but they might also just not understand. Cause I have

11:53.480 --> 12:01.720
never at any point said, I've been anti-gay, but at least I can't remember. You know what it is?

12:01.960 --> 12:11.880
I just assumed like, Oh, you're somebody who is on the right. And therefore you must hate the gays.

12:11.880 --> 12:16.280
Well, it could be that it could also be the fact that people on the left tend to take jokes,

12:16.280 --> 12:22.440
like as not just a joke, but as a dog whistle for what you actually believe. So if you make

12:22.440 --> 12:26.040
jokes at the expense of gay people, that means that you actually secretly hate gay people.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.880
That's a very common thing the left does. So maybe that's what they're doing because

12:29.880 --> 12:34.280
all of us here, including you, Lilith, even though you try to keep a damper on it because

12:34.280 --> 12:37.960
you don't want to get canceled. But I understand. I understand. I know what lies in your dark heart.

12:37.960 --> 12:42.120
Actually, all of us here have made like jokes at the expense of gay people,

12:42.120 --> 12:48.120
but they're jokes. And we know that we're jokes, but you're saying we know that they're jokes.

12:48.120 --> 12:53.080
And we know that we're all actually cool with them. You know, when we say breed Kibs,

12:53.080 --> 12:58.680
we don't mean to actually like denigrate Kibs because he's a gay bottom. All right.

12:58.680 --> 13:03.080
We're just having we're just having fun. Oh, no, just make it.

13:05.560 --> 13:12.360
You say at the expense of like, I don't think of it like that. For me, the the core

13:12.360 --> 13:18.280
fundamental of all humor is absurdity. And sure, homophobia is a fairly absurd concept,

13:18.280 --> 13:21.560
like being afraid of gays. The issue is, though, is that Arch,

13:21.560 --> 13:26.520
while you were doing your milk and a lot of your a lot of your comments were saying stuff like,

13:26.520 --> 13:31.400
No, we actually shouldn't claim Bill and Frank. And they were fighting back with you. Like,

13:31.400 --> 13:35.720
I know I've been getting into into fights with my comments section. But this time you've been like,

13:35.720 --> 13:40.200
you've been taking some hits over this. Not really. Like a grand total. I lost six

13:40.200 --> 13:51.720
subscribers, which, oh, no, no, I've lost a few too. Like, I'm not the kind of guy who's like,

13:51.720 --> 13:56.280
oh, they didn't matter or anything like that. But the things I felt like I had a very

13:56.280 --> 14:02.040
good, frank discussion with my community over it. We did a stream, I talked to them,

14:02.040 --> 14:06.280
we had a conversation back and forth, they kept to tell me their arguments, I got to tell them theirs.

14:08.360 --> 14:11.640
I think it worked out fairly well, honestly. No, fair enough. Like, I'm not saying that,

14:11.640 --> 14:14.600
like, oh, no, you lost subscribers. I'm not saying that. But like, I looked at the comments

14:14.600 --> 14:17.960
in some of those videos. And they were like, no, these are degenerates. Some people were

14:17.960 --> 14:22.760
saying shit like that. Like, oh, Jesus, you also got to remember, like, when it comes to the

14:22.760 --> 14:28.120
creative sphere and in feedback, and then when it comes to critique, always the most loudest voices

14:28.120 --> 14:32.920
are often those that are going to be the most vulgar sometimes. Yeah, that goes for whether

14:32.920 --> 14:36.440
you're making a video game and you release it and be like, oh, I hate these mechanics,

14:36.440 --> 14:43.000
you know, or you're just making a video, like, they're just gonna rise to the top, the scum

14:43.000 --> 14:46.760
rises to the surface. There are there were a lot of comments actually read that were actually

14:46.760 --> 14:50.840
pretty well mannered, and pretty well, well constructed. And they actually raised some

14:50.840 --> 14:54.120
excellent points. And we brought those up on stream and we had a good chat about it.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.800
Then we get to what you mentioned to start this whole section off Lilith,

14:57.800 --> 15:07.880
which was Ben Shapiro's video called Brokeback Zombie Farm. And it's like, come on, dude. Ben,

15:07.880 --> 15:15.000
what the fuck? Now, Ben Shapiro, like he's obviously like a partisan rightoid. So like,

15:15.000 --> 15:19.880
this is expected to come out of him, right? But he did the whole culture war. I can't believe

15:19.880 --> 15:25.480
they're shoehorning the gays into this perfectly fine The Last of Us show. And it's like, Ben,

15:25.480 --> 15:31.240
what are you doing? Come on. I know clicks. I get it. I get it. You know, your video had half a

15:31.240 --> 15:34.600
million views pregnant, made some money off of it. I get it. You have a company to fund. This is

15:34.600 --> 15:39.480
just partisan hackery. It is indeed difficult to argue they shoehorned in since it was in the

15:40.120 --> 15:45.480
game. It was in the game. They gave them a happier ending, and they spent far more time on it. And

15:45.480 --> 15:49.400
I'm still not sure that was worth it. We'll have to see how the rest of the show turns out because

15:49.400 --> 15:54.920
this was an entire episode dedicated to a pair of side characters. Yeah, so because here's the

15:54.920 --> 15:59.400
thing in the original game, Bill and Frank don't come back after the segment. So you're not gonna

15:59.400 --> 16:03.480
get any payoff. And they're also unless they change it unless they change it. So actually,

16:03.480 --> 16:08.040
we didn't die. I decided not to kill myself. And it's just the other guy dead in there.

16:12.040 --> 16:16.600
If we get to see more Nick Offerman, I mean, yeah, but I don't they'd ruin the story bringing

16:16.600 --> 16:21.880
them back, though. Yeah, they probably would. Yeah. I don't know if you all watched Ben Shapiro's

16:21.880 --> 16:29.880
video on this. I did watch it. He just he spends the whole time complaining from a purely culture

16:29.880 --> 16:37.000
warrior perspective. You know, it's like, Oh, this is the LGBT ideology lobby pushing

16:37.000 --> 16:42.440
gays into your TV again. And it's like, listen, you gotta, you gotta calm the fuck down with

16:42.440 --> 16:48.920
us, Ben. Like, no, things have swung too far in the other direction. Now, right, like,

16:48.920 --> 16:53.560
five or six years ago, we were complaining about them shoehorning in trans people or gay people

16:53.560 --> 16:57.320
where it didn't matter race swapping to black characters where it didn't matter. And it's like,

16:57.320 --> 17:02.920
this is kind of cringy. Like, what the fuck are you doing? Now, though, the reaction to that has

17:02.920 --> 17:08.440
become so severe that anytime you see like a gay person in the media, these people are like flying

17:08.440 --> 17:12.920
off the handle. And it's become too much in the other direction now. Yes, we our side is in the

17:12.920 --> 17:18.920
ascendancy. And we need to recognize that rather than continuing on the defense. It feels just like

17:18.920 --> 17:26.200
a money farm or a click farm. It's just like, oh, that's, oh, this is another thing where I get to

17:26.200 --> 17:33.640
get riled up and make lots of angry clicks with like, oh, it's so cynical, like gays have been

17:33.720 --> 17:38.600
appearing in television since forever. It's like now we're seeing more of it because now we're

17:38.600 --> 17:46.120
seeing there are more gays and oh, gee, the FCC doesn't fine you thousands and thousands of

17:46.120 --> 17:53.480
dollars if you show homosexuals in a non-negative light on television. Oh, I think he will also

17:53.480 --> 18:00.200
complain about that two second clip of lesbians kissing in Buzz Lightyear too, didn't he? Yeah,

18:00.200 --> 18:05.240
I think so. That was stupid. If he has to go to war with Steven Crowder, he needs all the money

18:05.240 --> 18:13.720
he can get, you know? So basically like, like righty tube is doing the same thing that lefty

18:13.720 --> 18:19.880
tube went through or like lefty twitch, you know, they're just eating each other at this point.

18:19.880 --> 18:24.120
They've like isolated off into their own little internets. And now they're in fighting for,

18:24.760 --> 18:30.680
for clout. And I was, it's funny to laugh at when it happens on the, on the left. And it's

18:30.680 --> 18:35.720
funny to laugh at when it happens on the right. And I think that basically Ben Shapiro losing it

18:35.720 --> 18:41.880
over Bill and Frank is just a small component of that larger issue of it's just people scrabbling

18:41.880 --> 18:49.320
for relevance. The inevitable spiral, it happened to Gamegate after people realized that once the,

18:49.320 --> 18:54.280
the video game journalists horse had been beaten thoroughly to death,

18:54.280 --> 18:57.320
a lot of people realized, well, we might not actually agree on everything.

18:57.960 --> 19:02.120
And then a lot of egos in a very small room, et cetera, et cetera, and it's happening to the

19:02.120 --> 19:07.480
left on red tube, et cetera. And it's happening again. Now, this is just the natural cycle of

19:07.480 --> 19:12.120
content creation. I think I know a lot is going to be cut out, but we've been talking for like

19:12.120 --> 19:17.160
nearly an hour and a half just shooting the shit. So maybe it's time, maybe it's time we should

19:17.160 --> 19:20.360
actually watch the show. We have two episodes to get through.

19:22.360 --> 19:27.240
Listen, I miss you guys. All right. It's a good time. You know, you could come in any time. We

19:27.240 --> 19:31.800
stream a lot Bart and I know, I know, but usually I'm busy. Like I'm also working on things.

19:32.840 --> 19:39.400
That's no excuse. You can always find time at somebody who has time management problems myself.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.280
You know what I'll do? I'll break up with my girlfriend for you.

19:43.240 --> 19:47.000
I'll, I'll free up some time that way. Jesus.

19:47.000 --> 19:53.400
Kibbs you have more. You're so demanding now. I'll start dating Kibbs. Okay.

19:53.400 --> 19:58.280
Arch. Now I understand. And now I understand the, the, the dynamic here, what's going on

19:58.840 --> 20:02.760
of, of why kids need to be, needs to be bullied. Cause otherwise he just sucks up all your free

20:02.760 --> 20:09.720
time. He does. He's a woman. I have got queued up in the pipe episode. I think it's not for

20:09.720 --> 20:17.960
me to still check. Yes. Episode four. Let's roll. It's currently black. I'm playing it right now.

20:20.840 --> 20:21.160
Okay.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.080
This is what I always expect.

20:39.720 --> 20:47.400
I think the guitar at least. Yeah.

20:50.680 --> 20:57.080
You know what? Unlike the rings of power, this song actually makes the intro worth watching.

20:57.080 --> 21:00.920
I think it's a nice song. They actually incorporate it into the show too.

21:02.440 --> 21:07.000
That's sort of what they're doing with like the new Mario movie from the looks of it too.

21:07.960 --> 21:13.640
Yep. Yep. Hello aircraft carrier. It's been long since last time.

21:14.920 --> 21:19.080
Fuck. There were some comments who were saying, arch, that you're too mean to this girl.

21:20.600 --> 21:25.480
You know, she might be, but is she like, she, she does not fit the character. She just,

21:26.520 --> 21:32.600
I'm sure she's a lovely human being, but at least she knows basic gun safety.

21:32.600 --> 21:42.920
Yeah. I hope so. For giving her a gun. Oh, she found it. Oh, that's right. If he took

21:45.080 --> 21:50.200
I expect to be gangster. Tilt the weapon. It lingers accuracy.

21:52.600 --> 21:57.240
Put the safety on, man. You don't want to just randomly going off cause it hooks something in

21:57.240 --> 22:02.600
your bag. Fun fact, the French rifles of the second world war did not have safeties.

22:04.440 --> 22:09.560
So they just would go off. It was a bit unfortunate occasionally.

22:11.240 --> 22:17.880
Yeah, no. Uh, if, if Litchin is growing on the cars, I guarantee you that fuel is not

22:17.880 --> 22:25.720
usable. That would be jello years and years and years ago. 20 years. How long does gas last in

22:25.720 --> 22:33.240
a tank a year? Like it lasts a year in an underground to be fair. This is something

22:33.240 --> 22:37.400
that every single survival setting gets wrong. It'll still be stationary.

22:39.880 --> 22:47.240
No pun intended volume two, but will Livingston volume two. Wait, is it a, this is a puns book.

22:47.800 --> 22:51.400
Okay. This is the best show, the best character, the best episode. I love

22:52.280 --> 22:53.880
already. Yes.

23:05.640 --> 23:11.080
Feel free to wait in the truck. Okay. But just know you can't escape. We'll Livingston.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.760
You'll be back. There's nothing you can do to stop him.

23:14.760 --> 23:24.120
At least somebody cleared out the cars from being on the road. Very convenient of them.

23:24.120 --> 23:28.520
Yeah. They conveniently just 45 degree parked them. Yeah. They used to take big ass plows

23:28.520 --> 23:32.360
on them and clear the roads for their tanks. And so they actually explained it.

23:35.560 --> 23:41.960
Oh wait, they're doing the yep. Right on the reading, but it has some interesting pictures.

23:41.960 --> 23:48.200
No, no, no, no. Put that back. That's not for kids. Please get rid of it. That's actually

23:48.200 --> 24:03.720
kind of funny pages stuck together. Who knows? I know what coom is.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.760
Okay. So that was shot for shot identical from the game.

24:09.320 --> 24:13.560
Yes. Yeah. She finds the gay porn from bill stash.

24:27.240 --> 24:32.360
You know, that one picture that people use to show like the downfall of America by having all

24:32.360 --> 24:38.280
these like McDonald's and Arby's and all these restaurants. This is, it kind of looks like that.

24:39.240 --> 24:40.920
That place, but the post-apocalypse.

24:47.400 --> 24:55.240
Wow. That, that one spot of grass was clearly driven over several times for this shot.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.440
That and the fact that, you know, you can clearly tell it's been mowed.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.120
20 year old raviolis, dude.

25:08.760 --> 25:14.680
Am I even eating that is 20 year old ship where do you ravioli? I actually agree.

25:18.440 --> 25:21.560
So can we start a fire? I'm freezing. Now, why am I going to tell you? No,

25:22.600 --> 25:25.640
because in fact, you don't see the smoke fungus in that smart.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.680
This is about to say, anyway,

25:30.440 --> 25:38.200
people remote, the fungal zombies just hang out and populated areas for some reason.

25:38.920 --> 25:46.120
It's because of the all the connections with the fungus going underground. They stay in like urban

25:46.120 --> 25:52.680
centers, literally just live outside the city and you'll be fine. Okay. So they're literally left.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.440
Wait, the pun book, the pun book. She better say some more.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.760
Why did the scarecrow get an award?

26:07.160 --> 26:09.080
Because he was outstanding in his field.

26:12.920 --> 26:18.200
This is sweet. The Joel and Ellie father and daughter moment. Those were like my favorite

26:18.200 --> 26:21.160
parts in the game too. It actually makes me want to go out and camping.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.320
Have you been camping before?

26:26.440 --> 26:27.400
Man, I hate camping.

26:29.080 --> 26:33.960
Correct. No one camping once. It was awful. Oh, it's percolator coffee.

26:34.600 --> 26:41.320
How am I more outdoorsy than the two men? I live in Norway. The outdoors here will kill you.

26:41.960 --> 26:46.440
I mean, same with Canada, right? Like, yeah, these are all woman excuses.

26:49.480 --> 26:55.160
I would love to put you outside my backyard. Just 12 hours. Just 12.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.200
Okay. I'm fine.

27:03.160 --> 27:10.280
No, you can't. Yeah. I did scouts training on how to do it. You love it. Okay. I'll just

27:10.280 --> 27:15.880
put you outside. No gear. Go sleep in the fucking snow drifts. That was not the stipulation.

27:18.600 --> 27:22.120
Caves. I just want to point out that Lilith said that there's only two guys here.

27:22.120 --> 27:25.320
Oh, you son of a bitch.

27:28.840 --> 27:33.640
When Tommy meets Marlene, she talks me to join in the fireflies.

27:35.240 --> 27:38.600
Same mistake you made. I got groomed. You got groomed.

27:39.160 --> 27:42.280
You got up pretty early. If you want to grab more sleep, I'm not even tired.

27:42.280 --> 27:51.880
Also from the game. Oh, no, we're entering Chicago.

27:54.280 --> 27:58.600
Yeah. Okay. In America, there's highways going around all the major cities, right?

27:58.600 --> 28:02.200
You don't have to go to the city. You can just go around it, actually.

28:03.640 --> 28:07.880
Actually, why the hell would you go through a city? Other than to cut down time, I'd rather

28:07.880 --> 28:10.040
go around it. Yep.

28:10.040 --> 28:15.480
Because, Kip, this is where the fucking story happens in this television show that needs

28:15.480 --> 28:21.000
conflict. If this was just driving to fucking wherever, pretty boring.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.320
What are you talking about? That's a very cozy show.

28:23.320 --> 28:27.880
25 hours of driving and Kyle was scratching at the wash. Please give me the faggots back.

28:28.760 --> 28:34.920
Well, here's one. I am actually happy for. I like long road trips. Long road trips are fun.

28:35.800 --> 28:40.360
So this looks like another level from the game because it has the soda truck in front

28:40.360 --> 28:43.080
of the tunnel. So they're doing the same thing again.

28:44.200 --> 28:47.880
But this isn't... Joel didn't lose the truck this way.

28:50.280 --> 28:55.880
Right. They were ambushed by some group and that's what they call a truck, right?

28:55.880 --> 29:01.960
Yeah. So I think this is actually the setup for a level in Salt Lake City near the end

29:01.960 --> 29:04.520
of the game. That's what it looks like.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.280
Go around it, man. Come on.

29:10.920 --> 29:14.920
Screw it. They addressed Kyle's point and defeated it.

29:14.920 --> 29:21.880
The answer was, he couldn't be honest. Take the next ramp and we're back on the road

29:21.880 --> 29:26.760
many times. Now they are turning.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.240
God damn it. Bye. Okay.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.280
It's a smart thing to do, though. It's a smart thing to do.

29:32.280 --> 29:33.480
I guess I'm right.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.280
Yeah, but now you're going to see that it's a bad thing to do because there's going to

29:36.280 --> 29:39.320
be like evil shit out there and they're going to have to turn around because that way the

29:39.320 --> 29:40.040
plot can happen.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.160
Don't you have a compass?

29:56.840 --> 29:58.280
Uh, how old is that vehicle?

30:01.320 --> 30:06.600
Well, no, I mean as an actual literal compass, you know, come here.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.840
Compasses are those things in your smart car, right?

30:12.360 --> 30:14.600
Actually, my old Jeep had one.

30:14.600 --> 30:15.560
Oh no, this is the scene.

30:16.280 --> 30:17.160
Yeah, that's a trap.

30:18.200 --> 30:21.640
Okay. Never accept people in the apocalypse.

30:26.760 --> 30:32.200
Oh, fuck.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.680
See, they're going to come through the city.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.320
Okay, so yeah, this is how it happened, yeah.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.800
They missed the best one-liner, though.

30:47.800 --> 30:56.680
In the game, there was a moment where Ellie asks,

30:57.400 --> 31:01.320
aren't you going to help him? And he says, he's not even injured. He just runs him over.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.360
He's like, he's injured now, motherfucker.

31:04.360 --> 31:20.840
Oh, Arx, just so you know, there was like 50 guys to kill here in the game.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.320
Yeah, he murdered like a fuckton.

31:23.320 --> 31:32.360
Well, there came number 50.

31:43.480 --> 31:44.920
Wow, they've got really good teeth,

31:44.920 --> 31:48.840
considering the apocalypse has been going on for a few years.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.680
Well, there should be plenty of crests lying around.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.200
And toothbrushes.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.400
Oh, lots of toothbrushes.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.360
Can't aim that low.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.200
You just shot Joel.

32:04.200 --> 32:04.760
Joel's dead.

32:05.320 --> 32:08.760
Yep, that was unfortunate.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.760
Oh, well.

32:17.720 --> 32:19.480
She couldn't know the bulbs got through things.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.000
I'm gonna go home.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.040
I'll tell everyone you're good.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.640
I don't know what to do.

32:25.640 --> 32:26.680
My legs don't work.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.040
My mom isn't far.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.080
If you can get me to her.

32:31.720 --> 32:32.920
You got to kill him, man.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.240
We can trade with you guys.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.040
We can be friends.

32:38.040 --> 32:38.680
I didn't know.

32:39.640 --> 32:40.760
I'm Brian.

32:40.760 --> 32:41.560
I'm Brian.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.120
What's your name?

32:42.120 --> 32:43.960
I do appreciate this scene, actually.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.880
And this is rather humanizing.

32:45.880 --> 32:46.280
Okay.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.000
Yeah.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.240
Well, also it shows that Ellie's got to like harden up.

32:53.400 --> 32:58.760
Remember, nobody's innocent after you shot them.

33:00.760 --> 33:01.240
Wait, wait, wait.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.760
My dude, you tried to rob us.

33:17.160 --> 33:17.720
Damn.

33:17.720 --> 33:18.920
Ellie, I got to get in there.

33:18.920 --> 33:19.720
I can't get through.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.720
That was some harsh shit, but I appreciate it.

33:22.280 --> 33:23.000
Yeah.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.440
There's some stuff against the door.

33:25.160 --> 33:28.440
See, this is also kind of why I understand why people were a bit annoyed by the whole

33:28.440 --> 33:31.400
gay romance thing, because it was overly idealized.

33:31.400 --> 33:35.480
And it was a happy ending in a universe that doesn't have a whole lot of fucking happy

33:35.480 --> 33:35.980
endings.

33:37.240 --> 33:38.200
The Bergquists.

33:40.040 --> 33:40.540
No.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.080
Mark Anthony Halpin.

33:44.600 --> 33:45.480
Carrie Schreiber.

33:46.040 --> 33:46.840
Haven't seen them.

33:47.960 --> 33:48.680
The Chans.

33:49.880 --> 33:50.680
Henry Burrell.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.400
Okay.

33:58.840 --> 34:00.040
You know where Henry is.

34:03.800 --> 34:04.280
Lawyer.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.480
Medical attention.

34:09.080 --> 34:09.880
Family visit.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.880
I've completely fallen off the plot now.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.000
Who are these people?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.200
What has to stop now?

34:16.440 --> 34:22.200
Uh, the Kansas City Fedra was overrun by bandits.

34:26.520 --> 34:27.240
They've taken over.

34:32.280 --> 34:32.760
Jesus.

34:39.960 --> 34:44.520
Now, I got to point out, no matter how much of a douchebag that guy might have been, if

34:44.520 --> 34:49.320
he's your only trained medical professional, that was a very, very, very bad idea.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.000
Yeah, extremely.

34:51.000 --> 34:51.240
Yeah.

34:51.240 --> 34:53.160
Basically, you definitely have a bad idea.

34:53.160 --> 34:53.660
Yep.

34:54.200 --> 34:57.160
So she said, find every collaborator and kill them all.

34:57.160 --> 35:03.720
So I don't know if they'll get to it, but in the game, the people had overthrown Fedra,

35:03.720 --> 35:07.960
like Firefly style, and they immediately devolved into a gang.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.880
Because of course they would, after you overthrow the government.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.080
There's no utopia here.

35:13.960 --> 35:17.720
And then they ended up being worse than Fedra.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.520
And yeah, you all know how it goes.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.840
Were they cannibals also, or was that a different group?

35:25.880 --> 35:27.320
They might have been the cannibals.

35:27.320 --> 35:28.200
I don't know.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.320
I don't know if cannibals were later.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.760
There was just like a hellhole maybe.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.760
There was a cannibal group later though, I think.

35:34.760 --> 35:38.200
Listen, human flesh with mushrooms built in, pretty convenient.

35:40.520 --> 35:41.560
You eat mushrooms?

35:43.480 --> 35:45.720
You don't put mushrooms in your pizza?

35:46.600 --> 35:46.840
No.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.280
Depends on what kind of pizza you're making.

35:50.280 --> 35:51.960
You ever had a good Canadian pizza?

35:51.960 --> 35:52.760
Bacon and mushrooms?

35:53.400 --> 35:55.800
As soon as we don't hear it, we move.

35:55.800 --> 35:56.360
No, bacon.

35:57.080 --> 35:57.960
Fast as we can.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.200
Canadian bacon.

36:01.160 --> 36:01.720
We got you.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.160
I think neither of you should exist.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.680
You need to widen your pallet or widen you.

36:08.040 --> 36:11.720
It's not all about post D&D pastries, Arch.

36:11.720 --> 36:12.200
Are you okay?

36:12.840 --> 36:17.240
His pastry is a sandwich with a piece of meat and cheese in it.

36:17.240 --> 36:21.240
First time that you hurt someone like that.

36:22.760 --> 36:26.920
See, this is why it's much better to not do this in the video game format too,

36:26.920 --> 36:29.560
because here they just kill like three people who attacked them,

36:29.560 --> 36:33.560
and it's entirely justifiable for him to still, you know, feel bad about killing people.

36:33.560 --> 36:34.680
It's a hard thing.

36:34.680 --> 36:39.480
But if he just murdered his way through a hundred fucking dudes, it would feel somewhat hollow.

36:39.480 --> 36:39.980
Yep.

36:40.620 --> 36:47.980
In the game, I think characters also somewhat acknowledge that Joe's like a mass murdering,

36:47.980 --> 36:51.660
like an absolute beast of a man in the background too.

36:52.300 --> 36:53.420
Sometimes, yeah.

36:53.420 --> 36:53.920
Yeah.

36:56.780 --> 36:59.020
Up where they had to tone everything down a bit.

37:01.420 --> 37:05.100
I end up a little bit better than the epic storyline.

37:10.940 --> 37:13.100
Here, have your little girl pistol back.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.460
Did you take out the magazine?

37:19.020 --> 37:19.520
No?

37:33.340 --> 37:36.140
Ah, the feds didn't know how to handle horror small arms.

37:36.140 --> 37:37.420
They truly were the ATF.

37:40.300 --> 37:43.020
Safety on trigger discipline.

37:43.820 --> 37:45.980
No, you put it in your pack.

37:48.140 --> 37:49.180
Shoot your damn ass off.

37:57.420 --> 38:02.300
You shoot your damn ass off through your backpack or there's more clutter.

38:10.860 --> 38:13.100
Now that means she's going to shoot herself accidentally, I bet.

38:13.100 --> 38:13.820
They're going to add that.

38:15.340 --> 38:18.060
Or like someone's going to steal it out of her pocket.

38:18.060 --> 38:19.100
That's going to come back to bite her.

38:19.100 --> 38:19.600
Maybe, yeah.

38:24.060 --> 38:25.260
Got mushrooms.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.040
Fuck.

38:36.860 --> 38:37.900
What did we tell the others?

38:40.940 --> 38:41.580
Not yet.

38:43.020 --> 38:45.500
Let's just handle what we have to handle.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.700
We can deal with this after.

38:46.700 --> 38:47.340
Kathleen.

38:47.340 --> 38:47.840
After.

38:48.780 --> 38:53.340
You have mushroom veins burrowing into your compound.

38:53.340 --> 38:53.840
Okay.

38:54.780 --> 38:56.140
Like you got to handle that shit now.

38:58.140 --> 39:01.100
The personal vendetta thing is going to be the thing that dooms them.

39:01.660 --> 39:02.460
Here's a problem.

39:02.460 --> 39:05.500
Clearly, you guys know more about what the fuck's happening here than I do.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.180
Because I am completely confused.

39:07.180 --> 39:08.220
I don't know who this woman is.

39:08.220 --> 39:12.380
I don't know why the clearly more senior and experienced man is taking directions from her.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.300
I don't understand what the fuck's going on.

39:17.260 --> 39:20.620
Like hell, I wouldn't even understand that they'd overrun Fedra unless you told me.

39:20.620 --> 39:25.420
I feel like maybe explaining this would have been better use of the previous episode.

39:25.420 --> 39:26.460
At least parts of it.

39:27.100 --> 39:27.600
Maybe.

39:29.100 --> 39:29.980
And I am lost.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.100
I can't really remember this story that well.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.180
In fact, I don't remember anything up until this point.

39:35.180 --> 39:45.500
But like the federal stuff, like you can tell with visual storytelling because you had like federal building walls or blood smeared on the walls charge anymore.

39:45.500 --> 39:48.300
Did you kill innocent people?

39:51.900 --> 39:54.460
Innocent is a complicated word in the post apocalypse.

39:57.500 --> 39:58.000
Joe.

39:59.340 --> 39:59.840
What?

39:59.900 --> 40:00.620
What are you doing?

40:01.900 --> 40:04.220
I don't want someone sneaking up on us while we're sleeping.

40:06.140 --> 40:06.640
I get it.

40:07.100 --> 40:07.980
Crunch, crunch, crunch.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.940
I mean, they can see you from the door.

40:10.940 --> 40:12.380
It's a good point.

40:12.380 --> 40:12.880
Okay.

40:12.880 --> 40:13.580
To shoot you, but.

40:13.580 --> 40:16.540
I put the glass outside the door, to be honest.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.220
I guess it's a good thought.

40:20.220 --> 40:20.860
Don't get me wrong.

40:20.860 --> 40:22.300
It's just poorly executed.

40:23.420 --> 40:25.500
Side sleeping is the only way to sleep, by the way.

40:27.580 --> 40:29.340
When we were talking about hurting people.

40:31.900 --> 40:33.500
What did you mean it wasn't your first time?

40:35.180 --> 40:39.660
I mean, she tried to gut you with a pocket knife the first time you met her.

40:39.660 --> 40:40.700
So talk about it.

40:43.420 --> 40:44.700
She goes in a doc.

40:44.700 --> 40:45.500
All right.

40:45.500 --> 40:46.000
Okay.

40:49.980 --> 40:51.740
Enter credit card to proceed.

40:52.540 --> 40:53.040
Basically.

40:54.220 --> 40:55.900
So it gets easier when you get older.

40:59.820 --> 41:01.100
No, not really.

41:01.900 --> 41:02.060
Yeah.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.940
When you hit a certain age and actually care, turns out to be kind of fun.

41:05.180 --> 41:05.680
Yeah.

41:07.020 --> 41:09.020
Did you know diarrhea is hereditary?

41:10.380 --> 41:10.880
What?

41:11.580 --> 41:12.080
Yeah.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.460
It runs in your genes.

41:20.460 --> 41:21.100
That's great.

41:24.540 --> 41:25.740
He thought it was funny too.

41:28.300 --> 41:29.500
So goddamn stupid.

41:32.780 --> 41:33.980
Jesus, I'm losing it.

41:33.980 --> 41:35.500
You're losing it big time.

41:38.460 --> 41:40.220
The character bonding.

41:40.220 --> 41:40.860
Not too bad.

41:41.660 --> 41:43.420
The only person who didn't laugh was Arch.

41:43.980 --> 41:45.420
Arch, you hate puns, don't you?

41:45.420 --> 41:46.140
He's not a human.

41:48.460 --> 41:48.940
I'm sorry.

41:48.940 --> 41:51.100
My intelligence is finally fucking high for this.

41:52.140 --> 41:53.180
You're more of a lizard.

41:53.180 --> 41:55.180
You remind me of that Facebook guy.

41:58.140 --> 41:59.260
That Facebook guy.

42:00.220 --> 42:03.340
This part is not funny according to the algorithms.

42:03.980 --> 42:15.420
I told you they had guns.

42:24.780 --> 42:25.500
Well, that's Henry.

42:26.460 --> 42:27.740
I think that's Henry and Sam.

42:27.740 --> 42:28.240
Yeah.

42:28.460 --> 42:29.580
Well, there we go.

42:29.580 --> 42:31.260
End of the first episode.

42:31.260 --> 42:32.380
Well, no, the fourth episode.

42:32.380 --> 42:33.180
The first one tonight.

42:34.700 --> 42:35.580
There we go.

42:35.580 --> 42:41.020
So yes, I can tell right from the beginning that one of the big problems with this episode

42:41.020 --> 42:45.260
is they didn't adequately introduce the antagonist of the next section.

42:45.260 --> 42:48.140
They just assume that if you played the game, you'd know who they are.

42:48.940 --> 42:49.500
Yep.

42:49.500 --> 42:54.140
Which does mean that Arch's point about the previous episode is now validated.

42:54.140 --> 42:58.860
Because it would be fine to do that episode as like a bonus, like fluff thing.

42:59.740 --> 43:02.700
As long as everything's like adequately explained.

43:02.700 --> 43:07.500
But here the antagonist in the relationship is going to be explained in the next episode.

43:07.500 --> 43:11.020
But the entire time you're just thinking, what, what, what?

43:11.020 --> 43:13.820
Because Arch is like, what the fuck is going on here?

43:15.180 --> 43:19.660
Because clearly there's a lot of story or rather who this woman is, why she shot their

43:19.660 --> 43:23.980
only motherfucking doctor, why they're running a little Nazi dystopia now.

43:24.540 --> 43:27.340
There's a lot that has happened here.

43:27.340 --> 43:31.420
And that would probably have been a better use of the previous episode.

43:31.420 --> 43:31.900
Yeah.

43:32.140 --> 43:33.900
Spend more time building this up than that.

43:33.900 --> 43:37.420
I don't know if I necessarily agree.

43:37.420 --> 43:43.580
Cause like, I think the show could be going from like Joe and Ellie's perspective, because

43:43.580 --> 43:49.580
to them, these are just a bunch of assholes with guns that showed up and they may as well

43:49.580 --> 43:52.940
just been bandits and Raiders, which in some ways they are.

43:52.940 --> 43:53.900
So that's true.

43:53.900 --> 43:55.500
That's actually, that's actually a good point.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.740
So I'll tell you how it goes down in the game Arch.

43:57.740 --> 43:58.300
Okay.

43:58.300 --> 43:59.820
I don't think it was Kansas city.

43:59.820 --> 44:01.020
I think it was actually Pittsburgh.

44:01.020 --> 44:02.380
It doesn't matter what city it was.

44:03.580 --> 44:05.260
They have to go into a city.

44:05.260 --> 44:06.860
For some reason, the roads are blocked off.

44:06.860 --> 44:08.460
They have to drive through the city.

44:08.460 --> 44:13.420
The exact same ambush happens where there's an injured guy, but this time Joel just runs

44:13.420 --> 44:13.740
them over.

44:13.740 --> 44:14.780
He's like, he's not even injured.

44:14.780 --> 44:15.340
He runs them over.

44:16.460 --> 44:18.460
They lose Bill's Bill's truck.

44:18.460 --> 44:21.580
It crashes into a laundromat, which is what it did in the show.

44:22.460 --> 44:24.140
And they have to work through the city on foot.

44:24.860 --> 44:27.740
However, the path, because it's, you know, it's a linear video game.

44:27.740 --> 44:31.020
The path takes them into the form of the former Fedra camp.

44:31.580 --> 44:37.900
The gameplay is you're just killing a shit ton of people, of people just killing a shit

44:37.900 --> 44:39.740
ton of basically of bandits.

44:39.740 --> 44:41.580
And you can actually like listen to them talk.

44:41.580 --> 44:43.980
And if you want to, if you want to get the story, you can listen to them talk about how

44:43.980 --> 44:49.500
they, they overthrew Fedra and how they've been like just ambushing people who come,

44:49.500 --> 44:50.460
who come through.

44:50.460 --> 44:53.740
Sometimes they enslave people who come through a lot of backgrounds.

44:53.740 --> 44:57.020
So you also find a data logs in the level because, you know, it's a, it's a video game.

44:57.020 --> 44:59.340
So you can just, you can pick these up or you can ignore them.

44:59.340 --> 45:05.900
The, the story basically was there was a group in this Fedra quarantine zone that was like

45:05.900 --> 45:08.380
the fireflies, but wasn't associated with the fireflies.

45:08.380 --> 45:11.100
They were these revolutionaries who wanted to overthrow the government.

45:11.100 --> 45:12.620
They managed to do it.

45:12.620 --> 45:13.820
They disbanded Fedra.

45:13.820 --> 45:15.660
They purged all the people who were loyal to Fedra.

45:16.860 --> 45:21.900
There was definitely some, you know, kind of communist rhetoric about what they were

45:21.900 --> 45:25.500
doing, but of course they immediately descended into tyranny.

45:25.820 --> 45:29.420
And what they do is they go out, they find people who are traveling around, they, they

45:29.420 --> 45:29.980
kill them.

45:29.980 --> 45:30.860
They take their stuff.

45:30.860 --> 45:33.500
If they have kids, they take the kids, they brainwash the kids.

45:33.500 --> 45:37.100
They turn them into workers for, for their new civilization.

45:37.100 --> 45:43.100
And they're very, they're very utopian and they do not like people leaving even more

45:43.100 --> 45:43.660
than Fedra.

45:43.660 --> 45:49.660
It's, it's every, like all of Fedra, all of their equipment, worse morals, way more willing

45:49.660 --> 45:52.300
to way, way more willingness to be ruthless.

45:52.860 --> 45:57.740
Um, just Fedra, but worse and, and, and, and less competent all the way through.

45:57.740 --> 45:58.940
But that's, this is the thing.

45:58.940 --> 46:01.900
All of this stuff is like, it's all data log stuff.

46:01.900 --> 46:04.220
It's all background conversation stuff in the game.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.460
You can just fight through it and you don't even have to care about it if you don't want

46:06.460 --> 46:06.780
to.

46:06.780 --> 46:07.820
But there is a story here.

46:08.460 --> 46:12.700
Um, the problem is you can't do data logs in a TV show.

46:13.820 --> 46:18.220
So they had to somehow bring it into the show and they didn't do like, they didn't, they

46:18.220 --> 46:23.180
did like a, like a 25% job of it because you can see like there's Fedra stuff, but they're

46:23.180 --> 46:24.460
clearly not Fedra.

46:24.460 --> 46:27.980
So there's like some environmental storytelling happening here, but they needed to do more

46:27.980 --> 46:28.220
of it.

46:29.740 --> 46:29.980
Yep.

46:29.980 --> 46:34.300
Cause environmental only goes so far cause we can, we can easily deduct from the Fedra

46:34.300 --> 46:38.140
building with blood smears and there's these like bandits that are occupying now that Fedra

46:38.140 --> 46:39.980
has lost control of this region.

46:39.980 --> 46:40.300
Yep.

46:40.300 --> 46:44.620
Um, but it doesn't really explain like who these people are.

46:44.620 --> 46:47.740
Now in the next episode, they're going to probably expand on the whole like Sam thing

46:47.820 --> 46:50.540
and the fact that they're leaving, you know, the society and because

46:50.540 --> 46:51.740
Don't spoil it, Kibbs.

46:52.460 --> 46:54.620
Yeah, but it's game that's been out for a decade.

46:54.620 --> 46:58.220
It's not even like, uh, like it's like, who, who is Luke's dad?

46:58.220 --> 46:59.580
Like nobody cares anymore.

46:59.580 --> 47:01.900
Nor you're spoiling arch for the next episode.

47:02.540 --> 47:03.740
Yeah, but here's the problem.

47:03.740 --> 47:07.180
This episode didn't give him any context for what the fuck was going on.

47:07.180 --> 47:08.220
And that's the problem.

47:08.220 --> 47:14.380
If the next episode begins to explain the context and that's, that's fair, but to address

47:14.380 --> 47:18.380
the point as well, that is being taken from the perspective of Bill and Joel, that'll

47:18.380 --> 47:18.940
be fine.

47:18.940 --> 47:22.540
If it weren't for the fact that the preceding episode was not at all taken from the perspective

47:22.540 --> 47:29.500
of Bill and Joel, making it a complete break from, oh, you mean Joel and Ellie?

47:29.500 --> 47:31.740
People on the television screen.

47:31.740 --> 47:31.980
Yes.

47:33.340 --> 47:34.540
Cause that's the thing.

47:34.540 --> 47:38.460
Like so long as the whole gay romance didn't detract from anything else, I thought it was

47:38.460 --> 47:41.900
perfectly fine, but it depends on the next episode.

47:41.900 --> 47:45.340
Like if they tell the story of what happened here through these two other characters that

47:45.340 --> 47:47.340
just appeared, I'll be more than happy.

47:47.340 --> 47:51.420
But if they never explain how the fuck this federal struggle is overrun, I'll be annoyed.

47:52.300 --> 47:52.540
Yeah.

47:53.580 --> 47:57.980
I thought it was fine to have a self-contained thing for episode three.

47:58.860 --> 47:59.980
And it has to be paid off though.

47:59.980 --> 48:01.100
So something has to work out.

48:01.100 --> 48:01.260
Yeah.

48:01.260 --> 48:03.900
Everything else has to work together to do that.

48:03.900 --> 48:04.860
Um, yeah.

48:04.860 --> 48:08.940
So from, from what I recall, Henry and since we're spoiling it anyway, Henry and Sam in

48:08.940 --> 48:13.420
the game wanted to leave the communist utopia and they were very mad about that.

48:13.420 --> 48:18.460
And they were sending like, like just guys in trucks, truckloads of guys after them.

48:18.460 --> 48:21.340
And, uh, Joel and Ellie just happened to be in the wrong place, wrong time.

48:22.780 --> 48:28.380
Well, in this case, from the dialogue, it seems like a Henry got the brother of random

48:28.380 --> 48:29.900
woman killed.

48:29.900 --> 48:35.100
Uh, maybe it seemed like when the, cause they were in target in the doctor and he was like,

48:35.100 --> 48:38.220
I didn't give them your brother's like, yes, but Henry did.

48:38.220 --> 48:39.660
You gave them Henry, I guess.

48:42.700 --> 48:45.020
Yeah, they're, they're implying that there.

48:47.020 --> 48:49.820
So there's, there seems to be more motivation.

48:50.540 --> 48:51.020
Yep.

48:51.020 --> 48:52.860
We'll have to see personal vendetta too.

48:53.580 --> 48:54.460
Yeah, we'll have to see.

48:55.580 --> 48:56.780
So let's start up episode five.

48:56.780 --> 48:57.660
I've got it queued up.

48:58.700 --> 49:00.060
That's uh, that's roll.

49:01.900 --> 49:03.740
So while this is playing, I'm just looking this up.

49:05.100 --> 49:08.060
Twitter's actually gone kind of quiet on this show.

49:09.020 --> 49:10.540
I don't know if that's good or bad.

49:10.540 --> 49:12.940
I mean, there's no big controversy surrounding it anymore.

49:12.940 --> 49:17.260
And this, you know, we're not counting Ben Shapiro's that was kind of nutsoid, but like

49:17.260 --> 49:21.580
the normies just seemed to be watching and enjoying the show, but not really talking

49:21.580 --> 49:22.220
about it.

49:22.220 --> 49:23.340
I don't know how to take that.

49:24.220 --> 49:28.780
Well, it's probably because the show is it's entertaining, but beyond that, I wouldn't

49:28.780 --> 49:30.140
say it's like stellar.

49:30.140 --> 49:30.780
It's just all right.

49:31.580 --> 49:33.420
Nothing particularly special.

49:33.420 --> 49:37.500
And it's not really pushing any particular point either, I guess.

49:47.820 --> 49:49.980
Oh, it's just going to be, it's going to be the backstory, isn't it?

49:49.980 --> 49:53.100
Of how they liberated, liberated the zone from the bedroom.

49:53.100 --> 50:01.180
It's a little bit of a waste.

50:02.060 --> 50:05.420
Yeah, the people's revolution.

50:09.420 --> 50:10.860
We all own the means of production.

50:11.820 --> 50:12.380
Oh yeah.

50:12.380 --> 50:15.100
These, uh, these definitely do look like heroes of justice.

50:15.100 --> 50:15.580
That's for sure.

50:16.300 --> 50:18.220
They're just killing the kulaks arch.

50:18.220 --> 50:19.020
They deserved it.

50:23.100 --> 50:26.460
Yeah, this is the problem with the revolution.

50:26.460 --> 50:27.980
It's just going to make you the monsters.

50:34.300 --> 50:36.860
I know you hang that person over a bonfire.

50:36.860 --> 50:37.740
I don't believe you.

50:41.260 --> 50:43.660
You will not really revolution it.

50:43.660 --> 50:46.620
Yeah, like that's a great image of a fair trial.

50:46.620 --> 50:46.780
Right?

50:46.780 --> 50:47.340
Fuck him there.

50:47.340 --> 50:49.260
Like I'd hand myself in in a heartbeat.

50:49.260 --> 50:49.740
No doubt.

50:50.060 --> 50:54.460
Wait, was the kid deaf in the last or mute in the, in the game?

50:54.460 --> 50:55.180
I don't think he was.

50:57.020 --> 50:57.740
I don't remember.

50:58.780 --> 50:59.740
Did it feel good?

51:01.180 --> 51:03.020
Betraying your neighbors to Fedra?

51:04.460 --> 51:05.420
The struggle session.

51:06.860 --> 51:08.140
Well, I'm not Fedra.

51:08.780 --> 51:09.500
Lucky for you.

51:10.780 --> 51:12.460
No one here has to die.

51:13.900 --> 51:16.060
Yeah, we could put you on trial.

51:16.060 --> 51:16.780
You're all guilty.

51:16.780 --> 51:18.300
So that's how that'll go.

51:18.300 --> 51:19.500
And you'll do some time.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.820
Oh yeah, that's much better.

51:21.820 --> 51:26.380
He had a place to hole up in the open city in case things went bad.

51:28.460 --> 51:29.980
But things have gone great.

51:30.620 --> 51:33.740
Haven't you heard Kansas city is free.

51:37.820 --> 51:39.420
I do quite like this.

51:39.420 --> 51:42.940
This is a very subversive take on communism.

51:42.940 --> 51:45.420
I told you everything I know.

51:45.420 --> 51:48.380
No, we are not really putting them on trial.

51:49.180 --> 51:51.020
When you're done, burn the bodies.

51:51.020 --> 51:51.740
It's faster.

51:54.380 --> 51:55.980
Man, freedom.

52:00.460 --> 52:01.420
People's Republic.

52:03.340 --> 52:07.820
I've been saying like every great writer of history says one thing correct.

52:07.820 --> 52:11.580
Even the people who are the worst like Marx or whoever I've been reading mold bug.

52:11.580 --> 52:14.380
He has said one thing that I like only one thing.

52:14.380 --> 52:17.900
And that one thing is sometimes freedom requires order.

52:18.540 --> 52:20.540
And it can't just be anarchy.

52:20.540 --> 52:25.900
You know, freedom from all possible institutions and just pure anarchy is no real freedom.

52:27.100 --> 52:28.220
I agree with that.

52:28.220 --> 52:31.100
That's why I'm a libertarian and not an uncap.

52:32.780 --> 52:38.220
Like we need some form of order to ensure freedom for people.

52:38.940 --> 52:42.940
Otherwise, it's just like warlords and well,

52:43.900 --> 52:44.220
roaming.

52:44.220 --> 52:45.660
Yes, it's just fucking this.

52:46.380 --> 52:48.060
Yeah, or it's just fucking this.

52:48.060 --> 52:50.060
He's scared because you're scared.

52:56.780 --> 52:59.740
No, I'm pretty sure he's scared because he's Anne Frank now.

52:59.740 --> 53:00.620
I'd be scared too.

53:04.540 --> 53:04.940
Hello.

53:08.220 --> 53:15.580
Well, he's deaf now.

53:16.300 --> 53:16.800
Yep.

53:21.020 --> 53:21.660
Look at me.

53:21.660 --> 53:22.860
I am the captain now.

53:27.260 --> 53:29.180
No, communists are still shooting people.

53:38.220 --> 53:51.580
Okay, back to painting.

54:03.420 --> 54:05.900
I always tell them not to whack on things.

54:05.900 --> 54:08.060
Yeah, you could always eat the paint.

54:09.180 --> 54:09.820
Oh, God.

54:11.900 --> 54:13.100
All the crayon tasting.

54:17.500 --> 54:19.660
You should probably go in the night, though, shouldn't you?

54:19.660 --> 54:20.380
I don't know.

54:20.380 --> 54:22.620
Communists are creatures of the dark, after all.

54:22.620 --> 54:23.500
They might see better.

54:24.940 --> 54:27.100
Like way skittered around the ceiling.

54:29.420 --> 54:30.380
The suction cups.

54:32.220 --> 54:33.020
Kibs, you're beeping.

54:33.020 --> 54:33.660
What's going on?

54:34.620 --> 54:35.980
What do you mean beeping?

54:35.980 --> 54:38.060
I heard a beep in the background of your.

54:38.780 --> 54:39.740
Oh, don't mind that.

54:40.300 --> 54:42.860
It's your microwave from making those hot pockets.

54:47.740 --> 54:48.940
Get it right in his eyes.

54:48.940 --> 54:49.980
Make him blind, too.

54:51.980 --> 54:56.860
Yeah, I'm not sure if smearing paint over your face is actually that intelligent.

54:58.220 --> 54:59.660
I mean, it doesn't really do anything.

55:00.940 --> 55:02.300
That depends on the paint, Kyle.

55:02.300 --> 55:04.220
Have you gotten paint in your eyes?

55:04.220 --> 55:06.300
Lead paint acrylic.

55:06.300 --> 55:08.140
It's not fucking lead.

55:08.700 --> 55:10.860
I think you let this kid play with lead paint.

55:10.860 --> 55:12.140
Are you retarded?

55:12.140 --> 55:13.260
It's the apocalypse.

55:13.260 --> 55:14.300
Who cares?

55:14.300 --> 55:16.380
It's acrylic paint.

55:16.380 --> 55:21.900
Oh, also, I mean, not to get racist here or anything, but I mean,

55:22.940 --> 55:27.180
they clearly are able to, like, stealth around at night easier because they're darker skinned.

55:27.900 --> 55:28.540
Oh, my God.

55:28.540 --> 55:29.340
I can't believe you went there.

55:29.340 --> 55:32.460
Ah, good point.

55:32.460 --> 55:36.780
Well, no, seriously, though, like, you're going to blend in in the night better,

55:36.780 --> 55:38.140
just practically speaking.

55:39.020 --> 55:39.740
That's true.

55:39.740 --> 55:42.860
My grand puppet always told me the tale of the first black person he saw.

55:42.860 --> 55:45.580
It was just a raincoat in the middle of night walking towards him.

55:45.580 --> 55:47.180
An empty rimmed raincoat.

55:47.820 --> 55:48.940
He was so confused.

55:48.940 --> 55:50.540
Wait, is that a real story?

55:51.100 --> 55:52.460
Oh, yeah, that was an actual story.

55:52.460 --> 55:54.140
It scared the shit out of my granddad.

55:56.940 --> 55:57.740
A ghost.

55:57.740 --> 55:58.700
Oh, it's a black man.

55:59.340 --> 56:01.980
Oh, they watched the whole Joel Ellie thing go down.

56:06.300 --> 56:07.740
Damn, he dropping them niggas.

56:08.700 --> 56:09.200
Yeah.

56:13.180 --> 56:14.620
Time to use us to your advantage.

56:15.500 --> 56:17.580
And to be fair, Dev, this isn't that racist.

56:17.580 --> 56:19.900
I mean, the black father has yes to abandon his child.

56:21.020 --> 56:21.520
Yep.

56:22.300 --> 56:23.180
Where's the mother?

56:24.460 --> 56:25.340
Well, good point.

56:25.340 --> 56:26.620
I think they're brothers, though.

56:27.100 --> 56:27.820
I think they're brothers.

56:28.860 --> 56:30.380
So where's the mom, then, and dad?

56:31.020 --> 56:33.980
Yeah, dad, you're digging yourself deeper down the hole.

56:35.420 --> 56:38.220
They were probably like, fed restuges or something.

56:38.220 --> 56:40.140
So they were counter-revolutionaries.

56:40.140 --> 56:40.640
Yeah.

56:41.340 --> 56:41.840
Damn.

56:42.220 --> 56:45.420
Well, at least the parents had a good reason to run out on them this time, then.

56:45.420 --> 56:49.180
See, he did put some outside the door, Kyle, you dumbass.

56:50.620 --> 56:52.140
That was you who said that.

56:52.140 --> 56:53.020
No, I didn't.

56:53.020 --> 56:54.060
Hey, that gun's empty.

56:54.780 --> 56:56.540
Oh, my God, child.

56:56.540 --> 56:57.900
Yeah, that gun is empty.

56:58.620 --> 56:59.900
That was interesting.

56:59.900 --> 57:01.260
They still didn't explain enough, though.

57:02.060 --> 57:03.660
You don't have to worry about what to say.

57:03.660 --> 57:06.620
It was better than nothing, but I would have liked a lot more than that.

57:06.620 --> 57:07.500
I want to help you.

57:07.500 --> 57:09.180
I don't know what the next step is with something like this.

57:09.820 --> 57:12.060
If I lower my gun, we didn't hurt you.

57:13.180 --> 57:15.180
So you don't hurt us, right?

57:17.580 --> 57:18.140
That's right.

57:19.500 --> 57:21.340
Oh, Joel's gonna do it anyway.

57:21.340 --> 57:22.220
That's just the way he sounds.

57:22.220 --> 57:23.260
He has an asshole voice.

57:23.340 --> 57:24.220
Joel, tell him he's okay.

57:26.540 --> 57:28.620
Everything is great, dude.

57:28.620 --> 57:29.120
Fuck.

57:32.460 --> 57:34.220
Oh, Joel didn't just kill them.

57:38.060 --> 57:39.500
Did he do that in the game?

57:39.500 --> 57:40.140
Did you get these?

57:40.700 --> 57:43.020
No, but how old is he?

57:48.380 --> 57:48.880
He's eight.

57:49.820 --> 57:50.320
Cool.

57:51.120 --> 57:52.000
You didn't ask him.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.360
You forgot your brother's age.

57:56.400 --> 57:57.760
He was 14 in the game.

57:58.640 --> 57:59.920
He was 14 before.

58:00.640 --> 58:04.560
There is, like, an Elie quasi-romance, slightly.

58:04.560 --> 58:06.240
To get a view of the city and plan a way out.

58:07.600 --> 58:10.640
And when the sun's up, I'll show you one.

58:14.640 --> 58:17.760
It would be like traveling during the broad daylight, you see.

58:17.760 --> 58:19.680
It's more challenging that way.

58:20.800 --> 58:22.640
It does feel like not a good idea.

58:25.200 --> 58:25.760
Oh, here we go.

58:25.760 --> 58:26.480
There's some backstory.

58:26.480 --> 58:28.640
Finally tortured and murdered people for 20 years.

58:29.520 --> 58:30.960
You know what happens when you do that to people?

58:32.160 --> 58:33.600
They become communists.

58:33.600 --> 58:34.800
They do it right back to you.

58:34.800 --> 58:36.320
That's how it follows you here.

58:36.320 --> 58:38.720
I know the city, and that's how I'm going to help you get out.

58:39.280 --> 58:41.600
Also, that city looks very functional, you know?

58:42.640 --> 58:43.920
They clearly, like, have...

58:44.480 --> 58:48.000
They were in a real skylight or whatever,

58:48.000 --> 58:51.040
looking down on the real city that was not apocalyptic.

58:51.760 --> 58:52.800
And they just played it off.

59:06.400 --> 59:07.680
Besides the communist rebels?

59:18.000 --> 59:18.960
Fascist motherfuckers.

59:19.840 --> 59:20.880
Fucking fuck.

59:20.880 --> 59:23.280
They're going to help us escape.

59:27.840 --> 59:28.340
Right?

59:31.680 --> 59:32.320
All right.

59:32.320 --> 59:33.920
You'll enlighten your child, would you?

59:36.640 --> 59:39.280
Okay, the more they do this, the more I'm on their side.

59:39.280 --> 59:43.120
It's fucking annoying seeing these retards walking around in broad daylight.

59:43.120 --> 59:44.240
Yeah, I'd do this at night.

59:46.240 --> 59:47.280
We need to get out of sight.

59:48.560 --> 59:50.720
I think it's this way.

59:52.160 --> 59:54.320
Then again, I suppose it's better than House of Dragons,

59:54.320 --> 59:59.440
where they shot scenes in broad daylight and then dipped them in editing to be dark.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:00.960
That's pretty bad, yeah.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.280
Would you like to watch a television show?

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.040
Yes, well, fuck you.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.800
It's actually a audiobook.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.280
I thought I told you put that in your rucksack.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.560
It was never paid off.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.040
Yeah, also if there's clickers, like, don't make any noise, dude.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.220
Fuck.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.080
I mean, he knows what they are, so he knows that they...

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.080
they operate on sound.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:46.960
Like, shut the fuck up.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.960
To be fair, they're walking down a lengthy concrete corridor.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:58.720
If there was a clicker down there, he'd hear them from hundreds of meters.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.880
Yeah, waddling towards them already.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.680
Yep, because of the way the sound reverberates.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:11.280
Whoa.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.640
Somebody used up a lot of crayons.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.320
Vaults.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.440
Oh, now you noticed.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.760
You fucking...

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:05.520
Well, I guess we can wait tonight, this time.

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.120
You know, I wasn't exactly telling you the truth before.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.240
About me not killing someone.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.120
There was a man, a great man.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:26.560
He was never afraid, never selfish, and he was always forgiving.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.520
Have you ever met someone like that?

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.760
The kind of man you'd follow anywhere.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.280
I mean, I wanted to, but I would have.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:47.680
Yeah, but Sam, he got sick.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:50.720
Leukemia.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.800
Yeah, anyway, there was one drug that worked.

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.320
And, whoa, big shock.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.080
There wasn't much left of it, and it belonged to Fedra.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.640
And if I wanted something, I was gonna take something big.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.240
So I gave him something big.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.360
That one great man.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.880
The leader of the resistance movement in Kansas City.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.000
A Catholic brother.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:33.280
Was that in the game?

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.080
I'm trying to justify the communist revolution a bit more.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:46.320
Yeah, I think in the game, they were just going after them for leaving.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.960
But being a woman, I was genetically incapable for that.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:08.800
Where's the justice in that?

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.800
What is the point of that?

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:14.960
I think it went over her head.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.760
He was a great man.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:23.040
We all loved him, but he didn't change anything.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.400
Oh, my God, she's Benito Mussolini.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.400
She was the one who finally brought the revolution.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.040
We're with you.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:35.920
This is Sargon's capital punishment arc right here.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.240
Why should we forgive them?

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:38.880
Kill them all.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:42.160
This is how you do a night scene.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.080
You illuminate it fully, and then you just have some darkness in the background.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.040
I can see things.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.800
I feel like it can't be quite this easy.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:55.280
Yeah, it wasn't in the game either.

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.040
There's gonna be something, I'm sure.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.520
He's like, no, Ellie, never, ever, ever happening.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:07.840
And then I'm like, I'm going to ask you a million more times.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:17.360
And he's like, oh, recognize the house?

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.120
This is the sniper house.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.200
Okay, so there's like an infamously hard level in the game.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:34.080
Where basically you have to go up a straight long street with like a

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:38.480
very accurate sniper killing you the entire way.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.920
There's a lot of stealthing and a lot of trying over and over and over again.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:47.520
Luckily, this guy isn't a particularly good sniper.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.480
If you don't move, he's not going to hit you.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.240
I'm going to go around, try to get in the house through the back, and then I'll take about.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.760
But if you go out there, he's going to kill you.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.120
It's dark, and he has shit aim.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.000
Nobody's going to kill me.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:58.800
Then he's going to kill us.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.480
Yeah, no, if this guy could aim this, I wouldn't be this much of a problem.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:08.720
Yeah, Cib Zloth, you recognize it?

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.340
Yep.

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:18.500
Man, that poor guy.

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:23.700
Like, he's practically blind at this point.

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:27.700
He's just pulling the trigger, hoping it'll scare them off.

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.860
Please don't come over here.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:30.820
These are warning shots.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.780
I just don't want to hurt you.

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:36.340
Was the mission at night?

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:38.260
No, it was during the day.

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.220
That'll bring the day.

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:48.660
Maybe your sniper's better in the game because it was daytime.

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:58.980
And this is where you unlock the sniper rifle.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:03.700
Oh, no.

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:07.780
It was supposed to be the silly sight set, except worse.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:21.000
Jesus.

01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:27.220
Joel's also a terrible shot.

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:33.940
I think the rifle has been maintained or something, because this is awful.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:35.780
The scope is fucked.

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:36.820
It just jammed.

01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.700
That's just a shit rifle.

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.700
There you go.

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.820
That's an awful lot of brown shirts.

01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.080
Whoa.

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.060
He's just a fucking kid.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.740
Well, kids die, Henry.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.300
They die all the time.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:27.220
You think the whole world revolves around him?

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:31.140
That he's worth everything?

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:36.260
Well, this is what happens when you fuck with fate.

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:41.060
Get ready to take him.

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:42.660
He's actually a fairly compelling villain.

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:43.160
Yes.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:44.900
I don't know about that.

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:46.820
The thing is, she sounds like she could be,

01:08:46.820 --> 01:08:48.900
but all of this is based on nothing but,

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:51.780
oh, there used to be a guy and he was totally chill,

01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:53.220
and so now she's Hitler.

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.540
You didn't show that, I think.

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:56.420
He was the...

01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:00.020
I think what they're doing is he was supposed to be the good guy,

01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:07.700
but he was also not a radical, but she's the radical and she's horrible,

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:08.740
but she also caused...

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:13.140
Was the able to introduce change.

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:15.460
Yeah, she was Mussolini.

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:16.580
It was bad change.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.020
Changes are good.

01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:22.020
But this thing like that needed way more cooking,

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.620
because right now it's so cliche.

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:26.740
They're trying so hard to make her the complex villain,

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:30.660
but the only reason I have to sympathize for this chick

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:33.780
is that she totally had a brother who was a totally good guy,

01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:34.660
or so I've been told.

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:39.380
And she's totally doing this for the right reasons,

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:41.380
or so I've been told, because feta were bad,

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.580
or so I've been told.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:46.500
But we're also sure she's bad though.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:47.620
Yeah, she's bad.

01:09:47.620 --> 01:09:48.500
Hold on, something's going.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.700
Oh, that's going to be the zombies.

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:54.500
Noise.

01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.780
Here comes the zombie cavalry.

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.100
Oh my God.

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:17.460
Yeah, it's time to fucking run.

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.460
Just just no, don't don't huddle that run.

01:10:24.660 --> 01:10:25.300
Guys, what the fuck?

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.020
No, don't save them.

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:28.500
Kill them.

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:37.060
No, I want them to kill the bad people with the guns

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:38.980
that are a far larger threat to the children.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.340
God, it's a super zombie.

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:52.660
Oh my God, what's that thing?

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.540
Yeah, these things are fucking nasty.

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.900
Oh, I didn't think they were going to have bloaters in this,

01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:00.100
because they're so ridiculous.

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:02.740
They're bullshit.

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:03.700
They're bullspongy.

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:07.780
Well, this one does appear to be bullspongy.

01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:12.020
They're going to get their muppets.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:12.980
Yep.

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:32.340
God, I feel like these villains are so undercooked.

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.380
He killed, they killed Santa Claus,

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:36.660
and that's all I know about him now.

01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:42.820
It's a little kid zombie.

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:44.900
That's pretty fucked up.

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.580
It's a kid clicker.

01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:51.700
Just shoot it.

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.020
She's out of ammo.

01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:56.980
She can leave her load.

01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:00.660
Did she not have one fucking magazine?

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.380
No, if the show was brave, they'd kill the child zombie.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.500
Luckily, Joe became a much better sniper.

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.780
Yeah, I mean, the area's illuminated at least.

01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:21.300
Well, he was shooting against the giant truck,

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.500
and he was headlights on it.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.380
It was pretty illuminated.

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.380
He never shot his headlight in here.

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:28.900
Yeah, it was heavy.

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:33.380
Underneath the headlights.

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:41.380
God does not understand how life works.

01:12:55.780 --> 01:13:07.380
All right.

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:13.540
I think they lost.

01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:17.380
Yeah, I think it's over for Kansas City.

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.020
That's it.

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:18.740
The city's gone.

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:20.580
They deserve that.

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:22.100
That's what they get for being communists.

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:26.500
That's true, but man, I wish that was more of a proper downfall.

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.700
Yeah, that needed like another whole episode to cook.

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:33.460
I think I have a whole but at least 10-20 minutes.

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:36.500
You think they'll be okay?

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:38.580
Yeah, I think.

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:42.340
It's easier.

01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:45.220
Oh, yeah, they've seen plenty of death and destruction in their lives.

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:45.940
We'll be fine.

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:52.420
It just falls asleep.

01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.580
So there's one thing I noticed.

01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:00.500
These characters, Henry and Sam, they are black in the original game.

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:07.620
And Hollywood's never going to race swap a black character to be white in the adaptation, are they?

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:09.940
Not in the current year.

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:13.380
Given it a few decades.

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:15.460
It always goes one way with that shit.

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:17.300
Of course.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:22.820
Martin Luther King is Ryan Reynolds.

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:31.300
Oh, no.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:35.140
Well, time to put them down.

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:45.540
Oh, don't give him false hope.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.580
Yeah, don't come on.

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:52.500
It's nicer than just take him out back and putting two fucking barrels in him.

01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.100
Usually like a fucking blood transfusion.

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:10.740
Yeah, no kid is going to be able to do that.

01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:13.860
I don't think this is going to work.

01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:16.020
I don't think it's going to work, Ellie.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.820
Just squish your blood right in there.

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:21.700
That'll work, won't it?

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:27.220
Don't worry.

01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:29.540
It's the cold thing is that she's trying.

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:35.060
Just magically heals up.

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:35.460
Zoop.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.420
He's like, you're retarded.

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:49.700
Just shoot me.

01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:53.940
That kid's dead.

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:54.660
He's fucked.

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:56.040
Yep.

01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.100
Oh, very touching.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:01.300
My character I've known for all of 30, 40 minutes.

01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.980
Like, she would have tied him to the fucking bed or something.

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:05.780
Yeah, he's fucked.

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:08.580
Oh, I remember this part of the game.

01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:11.220
It didn't happen in a motel, though.

01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:13.620
It happened like in a high rise.

01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.300
The worst part is he can feel that.

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:39.300
It happened exactly like that in the game.

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:39.800
Yeah.

01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:49.460
Oh, OK.

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:52.180
Well, I guess I was getting sick of these sidecarriages anyways.

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:55.620
I mean, that is how their story ended.

01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.420
Different location, but same way.

01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:02.100
Oh, God, no spicy joke.

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:02.980
Too spicy joke.

01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:03.620
Keep it down.

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:04.260
No, say it.

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:04.820
Say it.

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:05.320
Do it.

01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:08.260
Arch, Arch, do it.

01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:11.220
Every time there's black characters, Arch has to make racist jokes.

01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:11.780
Do it, Arch.

01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:14.100
Because it's funny.

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:15.780
Arch, it's on my channel.

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:16.180
It's OK.

01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:16.660
Go ahead.

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:23.220
That was the first time in a while I actually caught myself and was like,

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:24.340
no, that's a bit too much.

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:27.620
No, Arch, you have to.

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:30.660
If I tell us what I will truly be canceled.

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:32.340
Joel's been humanized again.

01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:32.900
My God.

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:41.220
Ellie is reawakening that human human inside of him.

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:49.940
He's at least taken his jacket.

01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:51.060
Looks like a warm jacket.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:02.420
There we go.

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:10.420
All right, so right off the bat, I am sounding a bit to the Bill and Frank

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:16.580
romance now because that story felt more important and larger and undercooked.

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:18.200
Yep.

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:25.460
Especially also to us, like every fucking person in this universe has a horrible ending.

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:28.260
Everyone, everyone they come over has a sad story.

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:34.900
Every one of them gets fucking nuked, except for Bill and Frank, who lives a perfect happy

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:39.380
days drinking wine as their mechanical generator lasts for 20 years.

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:41.140
Yeah.

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:45.780
So you have to remember Bill was a prepper, so.

01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:48.900
He was ready.

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:50.820
I think it takes you so far, though.

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:51.380
Absolutely.

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:56.420
But the thing is, like a mechanical generator is going to run you five, ten years if you've

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.940
got a good one, that fucking thing.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:00.580
And that was a massive industrial aggregate, too.

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:00.820
Yep.

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:02.980
It ran without a hitch for 20 years.

01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:09.300
So, I mean, you probably traded with Joel and fixed it up.

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:10.340
Yeah.

01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:12.180
And fixed shut up during the years.

01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:15.540
Joel did mention, like, trading for machine parts.

01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:20.980
It can be assumed that this was a part of that, because you don't need to explain everything

01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:21.540
in a show.

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:23.620
Nobody cares about it.

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:25.220
It's not that it's explaining anything.

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:27.860
It's that you have two characters who live a perfectly happy life.

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:28.980
Everything is abundance.

01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:30.020
The fuel is still running.

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:32.180
They've got they don't just have food.

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:36.740
They have fresh lamb chops with wine and strawberries.

01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:37.540
Yeah.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:38.820
And strawberries.

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:41.780
If I could have had the grew those, that's less ridiculous.

01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:43.140
So here's the thing.

01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:47.940
Meanwhile, everyone else is living in squalor and dirt and they're filthy and they get to

01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:50.420
live for about 10 minutes per episode.

01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:51.220
Yep.

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.900
So, Arch, here's the situation.

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:53.460
Okay.

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:56.660
The Last of Us is well, it's a travel story, right?

01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:01.380
So they can't stick around in one town for too long to really see the rise and fall of,

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:05.620
like, a big political faction because they spend the entire game on the road.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:09.780
And so you have to, like, get the backstory through through logs and stuff.

01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:11.540
Doesn't translate over to a TV.

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:19.300
However, every single person that Joel and Ellie come across meet a horrific death in

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:20.020
the game.

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:24.260
That's why, you know, Frank kills himself and Bill is bitter and alone.

01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:24.900
Except for Bill.

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:27.380
Yeah, but Bill goes off.

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.700
Bill needs a pretty fucking horrific end, too.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.060
And then his life companion fucking hangs himself.

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:37.300
Every person that you meet and while going through the game, The Last of Us, they all

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.940
meet, like, a terrible end of some type.

01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.540
It's always a terrible end.

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:43.620
And that's kind of the point is, like, Joel.

01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:47.460
I mean, I'll spoil a little bit more for you, Arch, if you don't mind.

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:54.900
Joel's actions as you go through the game become increasingly violent and erratic in

01:20:54.900 --> 01:21:00.340
the service of keeping Ellie alive to the point that, like, every single wander they

01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:03.620
come across just, like, meets a terrible, meets a terrible fate.

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:06.500
That's the point of the show is, like, how far Joel is willing to go for this girl.

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:08.980
And so you can make a story out of that.

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:09.780
Fair enough.

01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:15.940
And you are kind of correct in that whole thing.

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:20.820
If they're going to do that story, they kind of ruined it by giving the gay couple a happy

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:21.300
ending.

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.820
I wouldn't go so far as to say ruined.

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:30.180
It just feels more unfitting after seeing this.

01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:35.860
Like, it fits worse because if they have an entire episode to dedicate to that, then this

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:38.580
was a larger and more important set of events.

01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:41.620
Well, there are two episodes for this one.

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:48.260
And so far, I don't think they've ever really dedicated more than one episode on any sort

01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:49.540
of given topic.

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:50.660
Because that's true.

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:50.900
Yeah.

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:54.580
Episode one is the establishment thing.

01:21:55.300 --> 01:22:00.980
And episode two was the start of the journey and also Tess's death.

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:11.300
And episode three was about Bill and Frank, and episode four and five are with this new

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:11.700
group.

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:16.420
So they've actually had two episodes dedicated to this particular group.

01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:23.940
And I think for what they showed, and for the pacing and overall taking in the overall

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:28.420
broader pacing, I think they did fine with what they got.

01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:35.220
I think since everything else only had one episode and this one had two, I feel like

01:22:35.220 --> 01:22:42.260
doing three on this one would have stretched this beyond just a stop gap and made it into

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:43.620
an entire arc.

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:45.540
And this was sort of like a mini-arc.

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:49.060
And I think for what it is, it's fine.

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:58.100
But if you were more used to, say, The Walking Dead, the pacing from that, if this were

01:22:58.100 --> 01:23:01.300
Walking Dead, they would dedicate an entire season on this.

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:05.060
Because Walking Dead numerously did that.

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:16.820
When they would encounter a new group of people that will try to kill a main group, they'll

01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:24.260
usually have an interesting or overarching villain as the leader.

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:31.300
And they'll have several episodes dedicated towards learning the backstory and what came

01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:36.180
of the group that they are now in opposition to the main group.

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:45.460
And I feel like if you're used to that, then you could take a look at this and be like,

01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:47.460
oh, well, they didn't spend enough time on it.

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:54.500
And yeah, it would be nice to spend more time with learning about that stuff.

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:59.620
But I don't think it would fit this pacing of the skill that they're going with and the

01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:05.220
theme of just moving from one direction to another, because it's all about transporting

01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:06.340
Ellie throughout.

01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:10.900
Well, that's kind of the point, because all of the other episodes have been about Joel

01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:12.020
and Ellie.

01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:16.500
And then you have one episode which has nothing to do with them, which is a complete sidetrack,

01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:22.420
and then they don't do that for this group, which is this is a more important story element

01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:27.460
in their journey, which means the Bill and Frank episode feels way more out of place.

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:32.020
It feels like it was put in there and it doesn't fit in with the rest of the show.

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:36.980
If they had done more on this group, too, I would have been like, OK, they're clearly

01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:43.060
going for more of a grand scenery surrounding them rather than just the traveler story.

01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:48.500
Instead, you have the travel story that stops for one episode and then resumes after that

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.460
again, because I absolutely understand that none of the characters get to live, because

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.140
as you said, it's the traveler story.

01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:57.140
And so annoying side characters need to be shooed out of the way one way or another.

01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.420
Well, I think I know I think I know what you're saying.

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:05.940
It's something like it's something like you can have a story where you're going from place

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:08.900
to place rapidly and you don't get everything.

01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:13.300
And the and the villains of the day kind of have to be handled in that episode or soon

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:20.340
after, or you can have a story where like every time Joel bumps into a new group, we

01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:25.060
get like an entire flashback build up of what they went through.

01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:31.300
So in that in that in that type of story, each episode or like maybe each arc of the

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:37.380
show, it it becomes like Joel's journey becomes like a frame story with all these other

01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:40.180
stories happening inside of the frame.

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:42.820
You could do that, but but you can't do both of them.

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:49.060
You can't have one episode focus exclusively on Bill and Frank and then not give the next

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:51.460
group just as much focus, which they didn't.

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.980
And I think I think that's what we're going to do.

01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:56.180
Yes, that's that's my point.

01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:00.980
So I decided to look this up real quick just just to get some numbers behind this.

01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:05.540
So I looked at the Last of Us season one critical reception by episode on Rotten Tomatoes.

01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:09.780
So all the episodes are still considered good, by the way.

01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:13.700
But episode one has critical reception 100 percent.

01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:20.980
It is like 97 percent per episode to 98 percent for episode three, 100 percent for episode

01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:24.420
four and 90 percent for episode five.

01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:30.340
So people still overwhelmingly loved this, but it dropped down 10 percentage points episode

01:26:30.340 --> 01:26:31.460
five compared to the other four.

01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:36.660
And I think that's because that final villain at the end there, the woman just didn't have

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:41.700
enough time to like really get established and like there's only a couple of establishing

01:26:41.700 --> 01:26:42.260
scenes with her.

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:46.180
There was the scene where she's talking to the doctor and then there's the scene where

01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:49.940
she's in her childhood, her childhood bedroom.

01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:55.140
And those are the only real character focused scenes on her to make her a compelling villain

01:26:55.140 --> 01:26:55.780
for the audience.

01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:56.900
And it just didn't work.

01:26:56.900 --> 01:27:01.380
There wasn't the one thing the one thing we can definitely see here is the translation

01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:05.780
from video game media, interactive media to TV show.

01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:09.300
And this is where the video games able to do it better because better use of pacing,

01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:12.420
better use of exploration and visual storytelling through exploration.

01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:16.420
The show has no such luxuries to do these things.

01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:20.180
You can't overhear dialogue as they sneak through because they can only do like maybe

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.460
a sneak thing for like one or one section of the show.

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:24.820
And it wouldn't be very good at that.

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:29.780
So you can see that the story doesn't translate very well.

01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:34.100
And especially when they're trying to somewhat remain faithful to it.

01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:38.180
So that's going to become a bigger issue, I think, as we get further and further into

01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:38.580
the show.

01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:45.140
I don't know if it's that because it's not that this story can't translate.

01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:47.460
It's that they didn't give it enough time to translate.

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:53.780
Well, certain sections will not translate without them completely reframing and reworking

01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:54.260
things.

01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:58.500
They've already reworked quite a bit because of the whole like seeing like the bad guy

01:27:58.500 --> 01:27:59.540
perspective thing.

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:00.500
That's completely new.

01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:06.260
Like you don't really see them a lot because, you know, you're following this perspective.

01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:10.180
Of course, but that's them simulating the audio logs, essentially.

01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:11.940
That's the bad guy perspective.

01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:12.820
That's the audio logs.

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.020
That's the bad guy perspective.

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:19.300
But the audio logs leave a little bit more vague, especially when they actually talk

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:21.460
about the bad guys and all the things they're doing.

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:25.460
And it's not more so like, I don't know.

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:30.900
It's hard to describe because if you play the game, it was just you escaping with Harry

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:31.780
and Sam, right?

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:32.580
Yeah.

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:33.380
Yeah.

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:40.260
There's no particular like I think that woman was mostly like a background character, I

01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:40.740
think.

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:41.240
Yeah.

01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:44.100
Written for like the movie.

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:46.740
I mean, the show was big.

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:49.940
Yeah, she was like only mention logs, I think, actually in the game.

01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:54.340
They expanded it out a bit, but they didn't do anything with the expansion like in the

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:59.060
you stealth and fight your way through the city in the game.

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:00.980
And then you make it to like Sniper's Alley.

01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:03.060
Then you get out of Sniper's Alley, you just move on.

01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:06.100
I don't even think there was like a big rush of infected at that point.

01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:10.180
I think that was in our episode on this group.

01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:12.100
They completely reworked that whole section.

01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:14.020
That was not faithful to the game at all.

01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:15.380
Oh, speaking of that.

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:16.100
Okay.

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:18.420
What did you think of the first appearance of the bloater?

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:22.020
A stupid video game monster.

01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:23.700
Yeah, kind of.

01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:29.220
It's not as cool because what it should have been as the bloater should be fighting like

01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:30.020
Joel and Ellie.

01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:31.940
And it could be like a really tense moment.

01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:38.820
Like, I don't know, the bloater has always been scarier in the game because when it attacked

01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:41.380
you, you're like, fuck, not that piece of shit again.

01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.340
Like he eats bullets like nobody's business.

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:49.140
And he's really just kind of cancerous to deal with because he murders you pretty easily.

01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:52.020
Yeah, it's got the corner.

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:56.340
It's not as intimidating when he's attacking the bad guys.

01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:56.980
Yeah.

01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:02.260
So, Arch, I'm sure you've intuited this already, but the bloater is the stage after the clicker

01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:03.860
and the stage before you become a big mushroom.

01:30:05.860 --> 01:30:08.500
And you can run around and like spread spores as a bloater.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:09.860
You can just spit spores everywhere.

01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:14.260
And he's really annoying to deal with in the game because he's very bullet spongy.

01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:17.940
However, he has like an insta-kill attack, but just by infecting you with a bunch of

01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:18.900
spores if you get close.

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:25.460
Um, they were always, even in the game, they were always more annoying than scary.

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:28.660
Clickers were always scarier because you had to stealth them.

01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:30.100
You can't stealth a bloater.

01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:31.620
They're always like a boss fight, you know?

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.900
Yeah, the bloater was the quote unquote boss of the universe.

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:36.740
Like Dead Space had the invincible necromorph.

01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:38.100
This had the bloaters.

01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:41.460
Like they're there to try to drive up tension.

01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:46.580
But if you get caught on a section like that, that can, you know, the tilt factor starts

01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:47.220
to rise.

01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:48.020
Oh, that's the thing.

01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:54.020
Any monster that is described as annoying or frustrating is not a scary monster.

01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:57.460
It's a video game mechanic that you recognize as a video game mechanic.

01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:57.960
Yep.

01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.780
It's all about raising tension and how you execute that.

01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:02.340
And you know what?

01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:05.940
It's the example of the fucking alien from, uh, from aliens video game.

01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:09.860
The sooner, the moment you realize it's a fucking video game mechanic, it ceases being

01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:10.820
scary.

01:31:10.820 --> 01:31:11.140
Yeah.

01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:11.380
Yeah.

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:15.540
And isolation is really bad that where you just like, you can tell how the AI director

01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:16.020
works on it.

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:16.900
This isn't scary.

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:18.420
It just runs circles around me.

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:25.220
So, uh, compare the introduction of the bloater in this episode, which is it runs, it comes

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:30.180
out of the hole in the ground and there's like a, you know, uh, uh, uh, a soundtrack

01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:32.260
that makes it sound like it's going to be a big fight.

01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:35.140
And then he starts like beating up people and he's like ripping people's heads off.

01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:39.140
And I mean, it's cool and gory, but it's not scary.

01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:45.140
Now compare that to, um, to the introduction of the clicker back in episode two where they're

01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:49.620
all like extremely quiet for multiple minutes and they're just like, shut the fuck up.

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:50.980
This is extremely scary.

01:31:50.980 --> 01:31:52.340
And they're tiptoeing around.

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:57.620
And then when it finally shows up, they're like, it was significantly, the clicker's

01:31:57.620 --> 01:31:59.780
introduction was significantly better.

01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:00.100
Yep.

01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.700
They did better job of tension.

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:05.220
What they should have done with the bloaters, the bloaters shouldn't be there to save them

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:06.500
like from the bad guys.

01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:07.540
That's stupid.

01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:11.140
The bloaters should be this thing they bump into, but it can't quite get them because

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:13.220
of its large bloated body.

01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:17.300
But you are quickly figuring out very, you know, just through this audio that have been

01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:22.260
moving around that it's, it's something big, it's something threatening and you start to

01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:23.220
generate tension.

01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:26.020
This didn't generate tension because it sort of came out of the ground.

01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:32.100
I was like, there's also the problem that what it did have was it had no payoff effect.

01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:32.340
Okay.

01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:34.180
So we'd kill Santa Claus.

01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:36.820
And I don't know who the fuck Santa Claus is.

01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:37.940
He's just a dude.

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:43.060
And he's with the woman who is vastly oversold as some kind of villain.

01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:48.100
And then she's killed by a zombie thing like, there's no payoff there.

01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:50.340
It's just, it's just randos getting killed.

01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:53.860
And the show shows it as if you're supposed to give a fuck.

01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:55.380
It's like, oh no, Santa Claus.

01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:58.660
I don't think you're supposed to be sad about it.

01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:00.500
Well, no, you're supposed to care.

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:02.820
You're supposed to be like, yeah, he killed Santa Claus.

01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:03.860
He was a bad person.

01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.460
I don't necessarily think so.

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:14.100
I think like they were trying to portray the group as like a bit mixed, like a bit extreme,

01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:20.340
but I don't think like, I also think like Santa Claus looked like a bit remorseful or

01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:22.660
questions if he was doing the right thing at the point.

01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:27.700
Yeah, they tried to, he was like, no, no, you, you woman, you gave us the thing.

01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:29.460
We kill all these people and we're behind you.

01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:31.060
Like, I don't think he had any remorse.

01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:34.340
If anything, I think he was annoyed that this wasn't the plan of the great leader.

01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:40.420
I think he was like a bit, felt a bit conflicted because he felt like the woman was a bit extremist.

01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:43.060
I don't agree with you.

01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:48.260
And the reason I don't is because there was that one section where he asked, we're not

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:49.460
giving them a trial, are we?

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:50.260
And she's like, no.

01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:53.380
And he just goes, like, he seemed to be on board.

01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:54.260
He seemed to be on board.

01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:55.780
Fair enough.

01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:56.740
But I don't know.

01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:00.020
They could have given them more characterization.

01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:07.300
I think they were also like mostly like back way more in the background in the game too.

01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:13.380
So they still only had like, they had to pretty much write entirely new characters, I guess.

01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:17.860
And that's kind of the thing there, because I wouldn't be anywhere near as annoyed by

01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:23.940
this if they didn't try to sell them so hard, if they were just like background character

01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:27.300
and it was alluded to that they had done something horrible, like, okay, fine.

01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.140
It's a traveler story again.

01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:31.300
But they tried to sell them.

01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:34.020
Like they tried to be like, oh, there's a complex story here.

01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:36.740
Necessarily think they tried to sell them.

01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:44.740
They think they more of that just like gave them more filling as opposed to just like,

01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:49.700
oh, these are bandits and they steal and rape and shit.

01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:54.820
I mean, they dedicated several scenes to like building up the reason why she did this, to

01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:57.140
try and make her sympathetic yet still evil.

01:34:57.380 --> 01:34:58.980
Yeah, it didn't work.

01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:02.580
They needed either more time with them or less, I think.

01:35:02.580 --> 01:35:04.180
Yes, either more or less.

01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:05.540
One of the two.

01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:07.460
Fair enough.

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:10.900
I thought what I thought there was fine for the most part.

01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:13.060
It could have used a bit more, but.

01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:18.420
And to be fair, Lilith, they did say on Rotten Tomatoes that this scored a 90% audience approval

01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:20.500
rating, which is less than the hundred average.

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.580
But still, I mean, 90 is pretty high.

01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:27.300
So it's like it's this is still a liked episode.

01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:28.500
It's still a like show.

01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.260
People are still really enjoying this.

01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:34.900
It seems it's just that this I think even the people who like the show recognize that

01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:37.540
this is probably the worst episode of the five so far.

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:40.900
I don't know if this if this show deserves even even a 90.

01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:43.620
Like it's a good show, but it's not like 100% good.

01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:46.980
No, no, it's the modern day.

01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:50.580
Everything now is either a train wreck or a masterpiece.

01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:56.900
It's this I miss the good old days where if a show got a six, you're like above average.

01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:57.780
I might check that out.

01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:00.500
I don't remember those days.

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.340
I remember seeing a six and be like trash.

01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:04.580
That's because you're a fetus.

01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:10.020
I remember the good old days of the PC gaming magazines where a six meant above average.

01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:13.140
Arch believing games journos caught now live.

01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:16.660
Can you believe that guilt?

01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:22.020
Like I remember fucking the only like super high scores that they used to give out there

01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:23.620
was like for the really one.

01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:25.700
It's like Diablo got like a nine.

01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:27.220
Sacrifice got like a 10.

01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:30.900
You know, the big companies that had the big paychecks here.

01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:40.500
Well, I don't know if any of you three remember this, but back in 2006.

01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:45.140
All right, back in 2006 on 4chan's video game board.

01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:49.060
When when it was either IGN or GameSpot.

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:54.340
Gave a Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess an 8.8 out of 10.

01:36:55.140 --> 01:37:00.740
That was considered like a fucking high crime against gaming to give a Zelda title less

01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:05.460
than a nine and like 8.8 became a meme for years.

01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:08.340
You know, it's probably worth it.

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:10.660
Honestly, it's probably it's probably about 8.8 to be honest.

01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:19.540
Though we need to be returning to the numerical score system had a purpose and a point, but

01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:23.300
it has long since lost that purpose because now everything is either a one or a 10.

01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:24.100
Yeah.

01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:26.340
And they're just quibbling around degrees.

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:31.380
Like five is meant to be average in the numerical score system, but no one uses it that way,

01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:31.620
right?

01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:36.420
Like if you especially if you're like talking about, you know, let's say like someone's

01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:37.700
attractiveness, right?

01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:40.820
If you say someone's a four out of 10 or a five out of 10, that's like saying there

01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:41.220
is zero.

01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:44.900
And if you if you say someone there, someone is like an eight out of 10.

01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:45.940
That's like saying there are 10.

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:51.060
So it does seem like the whole numbers thing has kind of fallen apart in recent years.

01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:56.020
Have we said all we want to say about The Last of Us episodes four and five?

01:37:56.980 --> 01:37:58.500
Yeah, yep.

01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:00.420
Yep, I think so too.

01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:05.940
Next week, we should be able to do things normally again, because unless Archie have

01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:07.700
some more IRL things happening.

01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:10.100
No, I'm good next week.

01:38:10.100 --> 01:38:10.820
Very good.

01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:13.380
So no more Super Bowl, no more.

01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:20.260
I think everything should be fine unless like some some drastic event happens, which I

01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:22.820
mean probably will happen, to be honest, knowing our luck.

01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:25.860
But hopefully we'll all be here for next week.

01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:27.860
That's okay.

01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:31.700
The Redskins won, by the way.

01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:33.220
They're still called the Redskins.

01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:36.260
They're called the Chiefs now, which is not much better.

01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:40.580
Damn, it's not as based.
