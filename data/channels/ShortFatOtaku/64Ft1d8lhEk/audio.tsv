0	16440	So, over on the ol' video channel, I tried out the Kyle Rittenhouse meme game that went
16440	20040	viral a week or two ago, acquitted Self Defense vs. the Braindead.
20040	24800	The story goes, you play as this generic American teenager who just so happens to look like
24800	25800	Kyle Rittenhouse.
25800	30320	He's just received his not guilty verdict for his textbook self defense killing of leftist
30320	31320	activists.
31320	36040	And due to that highly publicized event, another horde of leftist activists have appeared at
36040	37040	the courthouse to protest.
37040	41240	You need to defend yourself with lethal force once again until it's time for your next court
41240	42260	date for that killing.
42260	45400	The joke being that it's a top down shooter with tower defense elements.
45400	49400	And the time in between waves of enemies is the trial judging your actions during the
49400	50400	previous wave.
50400	51400	I get the joke, it's pretty clever.
51400	55200	And the game is also full of equally clever little easter eggs.
55200	58120	Not just the story and the fact that the kid is clearly Kyle Rittenhouse.
58120	61840	The zombie who attacks with a skateboard is missing his bicep, referencing the wounds
61840	63560	of one of the people who Kyle shot.
63560	68920	Some zombies attack with bike locks, referencing a 2017 Berkeley riot where Eric Clanton, a
68920	73160	professor as part of an Antifa black bloc, hit his victims with a bike lock.
73160	77040	Other zombies appear to use spin kicks as their primary method of attack, referencing
77040	81800	a 2018 event in Toronto where a progressive soy boy kicked a pregnant woman who was filming
81800	83460	him during an abortion protest.
83460	88080	The generic female zombie is clearly Big Red, though the game randomizes her hair color
88080	89080	for flavor.
89080	92560	And though a lot of people are calling the first boss zombie Trigglypuff, I'm not exactly
92560	93560	seeing the connection.
93560	95880	The size might be there, but the hair is all wrong.
95880	99040	Same with the second boss zombie and the it is ma'am person.
99040	102340	But nonetheless, everybody can understand the stereotypes being appealed to here.
102340	106280	The soy boy hipster, the black bloc communist, the radical feminist, the ham beast, each
106280	110400	of them taking on this all-American kid who is cut straight from the cloth of somebody
110400	113920	like Mike from StarTropics or Zeke from Zombies Ate My Neighbors.
113920	117640	In fact, the game plays a lot like Zombies Ate My Neighbors too, both of them being top-down
117640	119840	shooters where you take on hordes of zombies.
119840	123820	Though acquitted, not being confined to a Sega Genesis can put a whole bunch more zombies
123820	124820	on the screen.
124820	128960	In fact, the game it feels the most like, at least in so far as style is concerned,
128960	132200	is Death Road to Canada, another top-down shooter where you take on hordes of zombies.
132200	136200	But rather than being a wave-based tower defense game, Death Road to Canada is a roguelike
136240	140080	where the maps and the loot within are randomly generated and what events you encounter on
140080	141840	the road are also entirely random.
141840	145660	The reason I'm bringing all this up right now is because I know that acquitted is the
145660	150240	meme game right now and people with a more libertarian political persuasion are laughing
150240	153360	their heads off thinking how triggered the libs must be.
153360	154360	And you know, they are.
154360	155800	All you have to do is go on Twitter and see it.
155800	159680	However, a thematically similar game coming from the socialist perspective, Tonight We
159680	163160	Riot, came out last year and the situation was entirely reversed.
163160	166920	Terminally online commies were praising it for its humor and gameplay, and those few
166920	170720	right-leaning people who actually heard of it groaned in exasperation at yet another
170720	172380	bit of cultural subversion.
172380	175200	Each side treated each of these games exactly as expected.
175200	178980	I will say, though, I got acquitted on sale for five bucks, it's ten now, sorry, while
178980	180440	Tonight We Riot is fifteen.
180440	184040	According to the Steam database, Tonight We Riot doesn't really go on sale all that
184040	186960	much, though that one 90% discount was pretty nice.
186960	188920	The database gives us more information to look at, too.
188920	192560	The highest number of concurrent players of Tonight We Riot was its launch day with
192560	193680	84 people.
193680	197940	It did have a shit ton of Twitch viewers, though, but those were almost all Hassan and
197940	199500	his orbiter streaming the game.
199500	203440	They all played it exactly once, all at the same time, on launch day, and never touched
203440	204440	it again.
204440	208560	The game remained dead until acquitted came out, when people started comparing the two,
208560	211680	at which point it hit its second peak of 17 players.
211680	216100	So we can sit here and laugh at the failure of Tonight We Riot, how Hassan's massive
216100	219460	viewership probably did more to hurt than help, since it clearly didn't translate
219460	223680	into sales, and how the meagre social media presence of the game has basically devolved
223680	227860	into virtue signaling and commie posting, except that one tweet about them by Andy Ngo
227860	231660	that went viral, where they ended up hiding the only reply that called them pedophiles.
231660	235580	In other words, a bunch of online socialist game developers put a lot of work into making
235580	238900	Tonight We Riot and it turned out to be a gigantic fucking failure, and if you want
238900	240620	to have some schadenfreude at that, fine.
240620	244180	But at the same time, acquitted actually looks to be on the same trend.
244180	247400	Yeah, it got that bump from the quartering, just like Hassan gave the other one, but it
247400	249940	still maxed out at 137 people playing it.
249940	252340	By the way, you see that second spike in Twitch viewers right there?
252340	255260	I'm pretty sure that's Game Boomers, my gaming channel, which hey, you should be following
255260	256260	if you're watching this.
256260	257260	Let's make that spike grow.
257260	259460	But the reason I'm talking about this isn't necessarily to shit on these games, but to
259460	260660	point out a simple truth.
260660	263580	The purpose of a political meme game is to exist.
263580	266540	The actual playing of the game just seems to be secondary.
266540	269140	I've played a lot of these political meme games on the channel.
269140	273900	In 2016, 2018, 2020, whenever an election came around, I pulled out a few garbage-tier
273900	277320	Trump games and had a great time on stream with the audience.
277320	282040	Games like President Trump The Way in Uganda and Lock Her Up The Trump Supremacy only have
282040	284940	value in that you can laugh at the fact that they exist.
284940	289860	Beyond the Trump meme skin of them, their gameplay loops range from extremely shallow
289860	294240	to non-existent, they look and control like Newgrounds Flash games, and even at like a
294240	296820	dollar or less, they're not exactly worth it.
296820	301020	Probably the only good game in this niche subgenre is Mr. President, where you play
301020	305420	as a secret service agent trying to push Trump out of the way of an assassination attempt
305420	307800	while running through a ragdoll physics world.
307800	311660	And I blame this one's success on the Game Grumps, as well as the fact that ragdoll physics
311660	314620	games are themselves their own meme, separate from politics.
314620	318380	The reason that people seem to make these games, at least in my opinion, is that they're
318380	322500	hoping to go viral on Twitter or get some clickbait article in the media published about
322500	326180	them, and then use that exposure to springboard into something else, whether that be a Twitch
326180	328500	career or a gamedev career or whatever.
328500	331060	And to be honest, none of these games are actually any good.
331060	334980	Yeah, I know everyone's fawning over acquitted right now, but once the joke gets old, what
334980	335980	else is there?
335980	339900	The game becomes punishingly hard after a handful of levels, where the zombies become
339900	341900	bullet sponges to the point of tedium.
341900	345500	The weapons are poorly balanced, because ammo infinitely regenerates, there's never any
345500	348000	reason to use the handgun over the AR-15.
348000	353360	There is sometimes a decent tactical choice to be made, between using the shotgun to one-shot-kill
353360	357640	a single target, or the AR-15 to spray and pray into a crowd, but that's presuming that
357640	359120	you actually find the shotgun.
359120	362020	Weapons in this game seem to appear only on specific levels.
362020	364800	Once you grab them, you have them for the rest of your save file, but if you miss them,
364800	365900	you're just shit out of luck.
365900	369040	That method of unlocking new weapons might work for an adventure game, but not really
369040	373020	for an arcade-style top-down shooter, where you expect weapons to act like power-ups with
373020	375440	limited time or ammo, not permanent unlocks.
375440	379340	In roguelikes, there are permanent unlocks that you can miss, sure, but that genre also
379340	383020	tends to have the game restart after death, so that you can have a different build in
383020	384020	each run.
384020	386620	But Equator doesn't do that either, you just restart the same level after you die.
386620	390140	During the stream, we missed picking up the sniper rifle and the battle axe weapons, and
390140	392340	I never saw either of them appear ever again.
392340	396180	Grenades also infinitely regenerate, so there's no reason to save them for when you need them.
396180	399820	All of this does lead to fast-paced, action-filled gameplay.
399820	403220	And sure, that's to the game's advantage to a point, but since you're not managing
403220	407720	limited resources, the rising difficulty of the game has to come from turning your enemies
407720	408720	into bullet sponges.
408720	411520	And at some point, that just stops being fun.
411520	415280	Basically, once the Kyle Rittenhouse joke wears off, you're stuck with a mediocre,
415280	417800	Newgrounds-style game you'll probably never play again.
417800	420600	For a dollar, that's probably fine, but five or ten?
420600	421800	Not so much, at least to me.
421800	424960	Now, maybe you just want to support artists and creators who are willing to make games
424960	425960	of this sort of political bent.
425960	428100	Fair enough, there aren't many of those out there right now.
428100	431580	And maybe showing them support, keeping them going, is more important than actually liking
431580	432580	their game.
432580	436520	Like I've mentioned in videos before, the left is employing Gramsci-styled cultural
436520	440160	subversion tactics right now, and frankly, one of the best ways to counteract it is with
440160	443400	your own side's cultural products, and that means funding them.
443400	446080	I guess I'm just a tiny bit sad that this is where we are.
446080	450880	These games seem to get made not necessarily to make a good game, but to appeal to terminally
450880	454620	online, always politically-engaged culture warriors who want something that they can
454620	456840	post on their social media to trigger their opponents.
456840	460480	And if enough people post it, or get triggered, then maybe a YouTuber or a streamer will make
460480	461480	some content about it.
461480	465360	This kind of stuff used to not be this, it used to be Flash games made for fun, not chasing
465360	466540	reactions online.
466540	469200	I'm not out here necessarily saying it, this should stop.
469200	472880	I'm not denigrating the people who made Acquitted, or the people who are enjoying playing it.
472880	476500	I'm not shitting on the quartering for making the video, even though I don't fully believe
476500	479080	him when he says the game is actually awesome.
479080	483080	The other side is doing the same damn thing, the left agitprops, the right agitprops.
483080	486480	Kotaku, being the piss rag they are, published this article.
486480	491400	Far-right developers Kyle Rittenhouse Steam Shooter is an edgy, it's embarrassing, in
491400	493320	a desperate attempt to upset the left.
493320	495360	This badly crafted shooter has nothing to say.
495360	497500	Here's a life tip from Uncle Dev, kids.
497500	501780	If somebody has little in the way of actual critique, but says this is embarrassing over
501780	504840	and over, they don't actually have anything worthwhile to say.
504840	505840	Case in point.
505840	508640	Why can't far-right provocateurs just be good at anything?
508640	512760	Kyle Rittenhouse was charged with the fatal shooting of two men in August 2020, when he
512760	516480	fired at unarmed protesters during civil unrest in Kenosha.
516480	521480	The case in November 2021 starkly divided Americans, with the left viewing his acquittal
521480	525760	as a miscarriage of justice with racist roots, while the right saw it as a victory for the
525760	527480	right to bear arms in self-defense.
527480	532720	The chillingly named Nordic Empire Games see it, based on the available evidence, as something
532720	533720	to gloat about.
533720	537060	What, do you think these people are Nazis looking for the fucking Tesseract or something?
537060	540320	Wherever you land on the matter, and let's not beat around the bush, he got away with
540320	541320	killing people.
541320	545480	I'd hope a person's central thought would be, innocent people died, lives were ended.
545480	549240	Dude, these are people who were mindlessly rushing and attacking this kid, he got away
549240	551280	with defending himself, as he should.
551280	554040	And they weren't exactly innocent, one was a pedophile, one was a wife-beater.
554040	557960	Like, okay, it doesn't really matter regarding this, but still, Jesus Christ Kotaku, you
557960	560600	guys have been shit for over a decade, how are you still going?
560600	562000	Look at how they frame the conversation.
562000	566880	Nordic Empire's website makes some grand claims about the vast importance of their existence.
566880	570600	They are three young men, fully dedicated to the development of games that are fun and
570600	573120	engaging, while at the same time staying committed to what is right and true.
573120	574640	But then, why make acquitted?
574640	579200	This is a game that, despite its implied bravado, its bold declarations, doesn't make any statement.
579200	583720	Beyond a character who could be anyone, clumsily shooting at some grey-skinned zombies carrying
583720	587920	early 90's Soviet flags, it fails to defend Rittenhouse's actions, let alone portray
587920	589540	a coherent argument for self-defense.
589540	593700	It reduces the complexity and tragedy of the original incident to absolute nothingness,
593700	597280	to a banal and tiresome experience that is somehow impervious to semiotics.
597280	601140	I mean, yeah, the point is that the game's a one-off joke, which is why I said earlier
601140	604920	that it gets old once you're done laughing at the joke, but Kotaku is pretending like
604920	606520	the joke doesn't even exist at all.
606520	609840	Maybe because it's people like them who are getting made fun of.
609840	612480	Compare this with how Kotaku treated Tonight We Riot.
612480	616240	Politics has become a dirty word in gaming, especially when angrily screamed, or, as is
616240	621600	usually the case, frantically typed by a vocal minority of reactionary video game fans.
621600	625760	But for more progressive players, games often aren't political enough, or, when they do
625760	630640	take a position, they push objectionable conservative concepts like capitalism, imperialism, and
630640	631640	militarism.
631640	636080	Tonight We Riot bucks these trends by proudly wearing its decidedly leftist ideology on
636080	639800	its sleeve, just like Kotaku proudly wears its own leftist ideology on the front page,
639800	640800	which is their right to do.
640800	644400	But it also explains why their articles are consistently partisan hackery, why nobody
644400	648440	gives a fuck about what they have to say, and why they're only just barely afloat after
648440	650880	ten years of crisis after crisis.
650880	654880	I can't wait until the day when we can finally piss on their grave, lads.
654880	659960	I guess I'm just saying that I am very tired that this is how the online political meme
659960	660960	game is played now.
660960	664380	A friend of mine, and a supporter of my channel, has told me in private several times that
664380	668620	whenever a game looks good, he meticulously combs over the developers for any hint of
668620	669860	progressive toxicity.
669860	674180	This is exactly the kind of thing that we decried them for five years ago, and they
674180	676100	responded with everything is political.
676100	679820	And unfortunately, now that they've made everything political, it kinda has to be.
679820	683700	I said this recently, maybe it was in an abortion video, maybe the don't say gay one, maybe
683700	686540	it was a weekly sip, I don't know, I've done a lot of content right now.
686540	690900	But recently I said something like, if team A only passes the ball to members of team
690900	696980	A, but team B passes the ball to members of teams A and B, team B will inevitably lose.
696980	700140	As non-leftists, that is the situation that we find ourselves in.
700140	703340	We should not be treating everything like it is political.
703340	705300	That is the path to totalitarianism.
705300	709140	But if the socialists and progressives continue to do so, we will lose, simply because there
709140	713060	will be battlefields that we will not fight on, and those automatically become ceded ground
713060	714060	to them.
714060	716600	A neutral space cannot exist in a power vacuum.
716600	720300	It must be cultivated and protected by the dominant power, with the full understanding
720300	724420	that for it to be truly neutral, the power must paradoxically allow for positions within
724420	728940	it to be contrary to his own, while simultaneously not allowing those positions to undermine
728940	730380	the space's integrity.
730380	735840	The difference between us and the leftists is, I hope, that we will rule with grace.
735840	738240	We won't actually have the totalizing worldview.
738240	742100	We will consider the value of a private life, and we won't insist that everything be made
742100	743100	political.
743100	745340	We will maintain that neutral space.
745340	749580	But none of these stances mean much if the subversives are still subverting.
749580	753420	And that means, when the commies make a shitty commie game for a quick turnaround, planting
753420	757960	their flag on that small hill in the culture war, inevitably somebody has to come around
757960	760900	and make a shitty Kyle Rittenhouse game for the same reason.
760900	762460	I just wish it wasn't like this.
762460	764020	I also wish it was a better game.
