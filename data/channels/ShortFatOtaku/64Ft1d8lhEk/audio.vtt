00:00.000 --> 00:16.440
So, over on the ol' video channel, I tried out the Kyle Rittenhouse meme game that went

00:16.440 --> 00:20.040
viral a week or two ago, acquitted Self Defense vs. the Braindead.

00:20.040 --> 00:24.800
The story goes, you play as this generic American teenager who just so happens to look like

00:24.800 --> 00:25.800
Kyle Rittenhouse.

00:25.800 --> 00:30.320
He's just received his not guilty verdict for his textbook self defense killing of leftist

00:30.320 --> 00:31.320
activists.

00:31.320 --> 00:36.040
And due to that highly publicized event, another horde of leftist activists have appeared at

00:36.040 --> 00:37.040
the courthouse to protest.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.240
You need to defend yourself with lethal force once again until it's time for your next court

00:41.240 --> 00:42.260
date for that killing.

00:42.260 --> 00:45.400
The joke being that it's a top down shooter with tower defense elements.

00:45.400 --> 00:49.400
And the time in between waves of enemies is the trial judging your actions during the

00:49.400 --> 00:50.400
previous wave.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.400
I get the joke, it's pretty clever.

00:51.400 --> 00:55.200
And the game is also full of equally clever little easter eggs.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.120
Not just the story and the fact that the kid is clearly Kyle Rittenhouse.

00:58.120 --> 01:01.840
The zombie who attacks with a skateboard is missing his bicep, referencing the wounds

01:01.840 --> 01:03.560
of one of the people who Kyle shot.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.920
Some zombies attack with bike locks, referencing a 2017 Berkeley riot where Eric Clanton, a

01:08.920 --> 01:13.160
professor as part of an Antifa black bloc, hit his victims with a bike lock.

01:13.160 --> 01:17.040
Other zombies appear to use spin kicks as their primary method of attack, referencing

01:17.040 --> 01:21.800
a 2018 event in Toronto where a progressive soy boy kicked a pregnant woman who was filming

01:21.800 --> 01:23.460
him during an abortion protest.

01:23.460 --> 01:28.080
The generic female zombie is clearly Big Red, though the game randomizes her hair color

01:28.080 --> 01:29.080
for flavor.

01:29.080 --> 01:32.560
And though a lot of people are calling the first boss zombie Trigglypuff, I'm not exactly

01:32.560 --> 01:33.560
seeing the connection.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.880
The size might be there, but the hair is all wrong.

01:35.880 --> 01:39.040
Same with the second boss zombie and the it is ma'am person.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.340
But nonetheless, everybody can understand the stereotypes being appealed to here.

01:42.340 --> 01:46.280
The soy boy hipster, the black bloc communist, the radical feminist, the ham beast, each

01:46.280 --> 01:50.400
of them taking on this all-American kid who is cut straight from the cloth of somebody

01:50.400 --> 01:53.920
like Mike from StarTropics or Zeke from Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.640
In fact, the game plays a lot like Zombies Ate My Neighbors too, both of them being top-down

01:57.640 --> 01:59.840
shooters where you take on hordes of zombies.

01:59.840 --> 02:03.820
Though acquitted, not being confined to a Sega Genesis can put a whole bunch more zombies

02:03.820 --> 02:04.820
on the screen.

02:04.820 --> 02:08.960
In fact, the game it feels the most like, at least in so far as style is concerned,

02:08.960 --> 02:12.200
is Death Road to Canada, another top-down shooter where you take on hordes of zombies.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.200
But rather than being a wave-based tower defense game, Death Road to Canada is a roguelike

02:16.240 --> 02:20.080
where the maps and the loot within are randomly generated and what events you encounter on

02:20.080 --> 02:21.840
the road are also entirely random.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.660
The reason I'm bringing all this up right now is because I know that acquitted is the

02:25.660 --> 02:30.240
meme game right now and people with a more libertarian political persuasion are laughing

02:30.240 --> 02:33.360
their heads off thinking how triggered the libs must be.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.360
And you know, they are.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.800
All you have to do is go on Twitter and see it.

02:35.800 --> 02:39.680
However, a thematically similar game coming from the socialist perspective, Tonight We

02:39.680 --> 02:43.160
Riot, came out last year and the situation was entirely reversed.

02:43.160 --> 02:46.920
Terminally online commies were praising it for its humor and gameplay, and those few

02:46.920 --> 02:50.720
right-leaning people who actually heard of it groaned in exasperation at yet another

02:50.720 --> 02:52.380
bit of cultural subversion.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.200
Each side treated each of these games exactly as expected.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.980
I will say, though, I got acquitted on sale for five bucks, it's ten now, sorry, while

02:58.980 --> 03:00.440
Tonight We Riot is fifteen.

03:00.440 --> 03:04.040
According to the Steam database, Tonight We Riot doesn't really go on sale all that

03:04.040 --> 03:06.960
much, though that one 90% discount was pretty nice.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.920
The database gives us more information to look at, too.

03:08.920 --> 03:12.560
The highest number of concurrent players of Tonight We Riot was its launch day with

03:12.560 --> 03:13.680
84 people.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.940
It did have a shit ton of Twitch viewers, though, but those were almost all Hassan and

03:17.940 --> 03:19.500
his orbiter streaming the game.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.440
They all played it exactly once, all at the same time, on launch day, and never touched

03:23.440 --> 03:24.440
it again.

03:24.440 --> 03:28.560
The game remained dead until acquitted came out, when people started comparing the two,

03:28.560 --> 03:31.680
at which point it hit its second peak of 17 players.

03:31.680 --> 03:36.100
So we can sit here and laugh at the failure of Tonight We Riot, how Hassan's massive

03:36.100 --> 03:39.460
viewership probably did more to hurt than help, since it clearly didn't translate

03:39.460 --> 03:43.680
into sales, and how the meagre social media presence of the game has basically devolved

03:43.680 --> 03:47.860
into virtue signaling and commie posting, except that one tweet about them by Andy Ngo

03:47.860 --> 03:51.660
that went viral, where they ended up hiding the only reply that called them pedophiles.

03:51.660 --> 03:55.580
In other words, a bunch of online socialist game developers put a lot of work into making

03:55.580 --> 03:58.900
Tonight We Riot and it turned out to be a gigantic fucking failure, and if you want

03:58.900 --> 04:00.620
to have some schadenfreude at that, fine.

04:00.620 --> 04:04.180
But at the same time, acquitted actually looks to be on the same trend.

04:04.180 --> 04:07.400
Yeah, it got that bump from the quartering, just like Hassan gave the other one, but it

04:07.400 --> 04:09.940
still maxed out at 137 people playing it.

04:09.940 --> 04:12.340
By the way, you see that second spike in Twitch viewers right there?

04:12.340 --> 04:15.260
I'm pretty sure that's Game Boomers, my gaming channel, which hey, you should be following

04:15.260 --> 04:16.260
if you're watching this.

04:16.260 --> 04:17.260
Let's make that spike grow.

04:17.260 --> 04:19.460
But the reason I'm talking about this isn't necessarily to shit on these games, but to

04:19.460 --> 04:20.660
point out a simple truth.

04:20.660 --> 04:23.580
The purpose of a political meme game is to exist.

04:23.580 --> 04:26.540
The actual playing of the game just seems to be secondary.

04:26.540 --> 04:29.140
I've played a lot of these political meme games on the channel.

04:29.140 --> 04:33.900
In 2016, 2018, 2020, whenever an election came around, I pulled out a few garbage-tier

04:33.900 --> 04:37.320
Trump games and had a great time on stream with the audience.

04:37.320 --> 04:42.040
Games like President Trump The Way in Uganda and Lock Her Up The Trump Supremacy only have

04:42.040 --> 04:44.940
value in that you can laugh at the fact that they exist.

04:44.940 --> 04:49.860
Beyond the Trump meme skin of them, their gameplay loops range from extremely shallow

04:49.860 --> 04:54.240
to non-existent, they look and control like Newgrounds Flash games, and even at like a

04:54.240 --> 04:56.820
dollar or less, they're not exactly worth it.

04:56.820 --> 05:01.020
Probably the only good game in this niche subgenre is Mr. President, where you play

05:01.020 --> 05:05.420
as a secret service agent trying to push Trump out of the way of an assassination attempt

05:05.420 --> 05:07.800
while running through a ragdoll physics world.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.660
And I blame this one's success on the Game Grumps, as well as the fact that ragdoll physics

05:11.660 --> 05:14.620
games are themselves their own meme, separate from politics.

05:14.620 --> 05:18.380
The reason that people seem to make these games, at least in my opinion, is that they're

05:18.380 --> 05:22.500
hoping to go viral on Twitter or get some clickbait article in the media published about

05:22.500 --> 05:26.180
them, and then use that exposure to springboard into something else, whether that be a Twitch

05:26.180 --> 05:28.500
career or a gamedev career or whatever.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.060
And to be honest, none of these games are actually any good.

05:31.060 --> 05:34.980
Yeah, I know everyone's fawning over acquitted right now, but once the joke gets old, what

05:34.980 --> 05:35.980
else is there?

05:35.980 --> 05:39.900
The game becomes punishingly hard after a handful of levels, where the zombies become

05:39.900 --> 05:41.900
bullet sponges to the point of tedium.

05:41.900 --> 05:45.500
The weapons are poorly balanced, because ammo infinitely regenerates, there's never any

05:45.500 --> 05:48.000
reason to use the handgun over the AR-15.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.360
There is sometimes a decent tactical choice to be made, between using the shotgun to one-shot-kill

05:53.360 --> 05:57.640
a single target, or the AR-15 to spray and pray into a crowd, but that's presuming that

05:57.640 --> 05:59.120
you actually find the shotgun.

05:59.120 --> 06:02.020
Weapons in this game seem to appear only on specific levels.

06:02.020 --> 06:04.800
Once you grab them, you have them for the rest of your save file, but if you miss them,

06:04.800 --> 06:05.900
you're just shit out of luck.

06:05.900 --> 06:09.040
That method of unlocking new weapons might work for an adventure game, but not really

06:09.040 --> 06:13.020
for an arcade-style top-down shooter, where you expect weapons to act like power-ups with

06:13.020 --> 06:15.440
limited time or ammo, not permanent unlocks.

06:15.440 --> 06:19.340
In roguelikes, there are permanent unlocks that you can miss, sure, but that genre also

06:19.340 --> 06:23.020
tends to have the game restart after death, so that you can have a different build in

06:23.020 --> 06:24.020
each run.

06:24.020 --> 06:26.620
But Equator doesn't do that either, you just restart the same level after you die.

06:26.620 --> 06:30.140
During the stream, we missed picking up the sniper rifle and the battle axe weapons, and

06:30.140 --> 06:32.340
I never saw either of them appear ever again.

06:32.340 --> 06:36.180
Grenades also infinitely regenerate, so there's no reason to save them for when you need them.

06:36.180 --> 06:39.820
All of this does lead to fast-paced, action-filled gameplay.

06:39.820 --> 06:43.220
And sure, that's to the game's advantage to a point, but since you're not managing

06:43.220 --> 06:47.720
limited resources, the rising difficulty of the game has to come from turning your enemies

06:47.720 --> 06:48.720
into bullet sponges.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.520
And at some point, that just stops being fun.

06:51.520 --> 06:55.280
Basically, once the Kyle Rittenhouse joke wears off, you're stuck with a mediocre,

06:55.280 --> 06:57.800
Newgrounds-style game you'll probably never play again.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.600
For a dollar, that's probably fine, but five or ten?

07:00.600 --> 07:01.800
Not so much, at least to me.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.960
Now, maybe you just want to support artists and creators who are willing to make games

07:04.960 --> 07:05.960
of this sort of political bent.

07:05.960 --> 07:08.100
Fair enough, there aren't many of those out there right now.

07:08.100 --> 07:11.580
And maybe showing them support, keeping them going, is more important than actually liking

07:11.580 --> 07:12.580
their game.

07:12.580 --> 07:16.520
Like I've mentioned in videos before, the left is employing Gramsci-styled cultural

07:16.520 --> 07:20.160
subversion tactics right now, and frankly, one of the best ways to counteract it is with

07:20.160 --> 07:23.400
your own side's cultural products, and that means funding them.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.080
I guess I'm just a tiny bit sad that this is where we are.

07:26.080 --> 07:30.880
These games seem to get made not necessarily to make a good game, but to appeal to terminally

07:30.880 --> 07:34.620
online, always politically-engaged culture warriors who want something that they can

07:34.620 --> 07:36.840
post on their social media to trigger their opponents.

07:36.840 --> 07:40.480
And if enough people post it, or get triggered, then maybe a YouTuber or a streamer will make

07:40.480 --> 07:41.480
some content about it.

07:41.480 --> 07:45.360
This kind of stuff used to not be this, it used to be Flash games made for fun, not chasing

07:45.360 --> 07:46.540
reactions online.

07:46.540 --> 07:49.200
I'm not out here necessarily saying it, this should stop.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.880
I'm not denigrating the people who made Acquitted, or the people who are enjoying playing it.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.500
I'm not shitting on the quartering for making the video, even though I don't fully believe

07:56.500 --> 07:59.080
him when he says the game is actually awesome.

07:59.080 --> 08:03.080
The other side is doing the same damn thing, the left agitprops, the right agitprops.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.480
Kotaku, being the piss rag they are, published this article.

08:06.480 --> 08:11.400
Far-right developers Kyle Rittenhouse Steam Shooter is an edgy, it's embarrassing, in

08:11.400 --> 08:13.320
a desperate attempt to upset the left.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.360
This badly crafted shooter has nothing to say.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.500
Here's a life tip from Uncle Dev, kids.

08:17.500 --> 08:21.780
If somebody has little in the way of actual critique, but says this is embarrassing over

08:21.780 --> 08:24.840
and over, they don't actually have anything worthwhile to say.

08:24.840 --> 08:25.840
Case in point.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.640
Why can't far-right provocateurs just be good at anything?

08:28.640 --> 08:32.760
Kyle Rittenhouse was charged with the fatal shooting of two men in August 2020, when he

08:32.760 --> 08:36.480
fired at unarmed protesters during civil unrest in Kenosha.

08:36.480 --> 08:41.480
The case in November 2021 starkly divided Americans, with the left viewing his acquittal

08:41.480 --> 08:45.760
as a miscarriage of justice with racist roots, while the right saw it as a victory for the

08:45.760 --> 08:47.480
right to bear arms in self-defense.

08:47.480 --> 08:52.720
The chillingly named Nordic Empire Games see it, based on the available evidence, as something

08:52.720 --> 08:53.720
to gloat about.

08:53.720 --> 08:57.060
What, do you think these people are Nazis looking for the fucking Tesseract or something?

08:57.060 --> 09:00.320
Wherever you land on the matter, and let's not beat around the bush, he got away with

09:00.320 --> 09:01.320
killing people.

09:01.320 --> 09:05.480
I'd hope a person's central thought would be, innocent people died, lives were ended.

09:05.480 --> 09:09.240
Dude, these are people who were mindlessly rushing and attacking this kid, he got away

09:09.240 --> 09:11.280
with defending himself, as he should.

09:11.280 --> 09:14.040
And they weren't exactly innocent, one was a pedophile, one was a wife-beater.

09:14.040 --> 09:17.960
Like, okay, it doesn't really matter regarding this, but still, Jesus Christ Kotaku, you

09:17.960 --> 09:20.600
guys have been shit for over a decade, how are you still going?

09:20.600 --> 09:22.000
Look at how they frame the conversation.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.880
Nordic Empire's website makes some grand claims about the vast importance of their existence.

09:26.880 --> 09:30.600
They are three young men, fully dedicated to the development of games that are fun and

09:30.600 --> 09:33.120
engaging, while at the same time staying committed to what is right and true.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.640
But then, why make acquitted?

09:34.640 --> 09:39.200
This is a game that, despite its implied bravado, its bold declarations, doesn't make any statement.

09:39.200 --> 09:43.720
Beyond a character who could be anyone, clumsily shooting at some grey-skinned zombies carrying

09:43.720 --> 09:47.920
early 90's Soviet flags, it fails to defend Rittenhouse's actions, let alone portray

09:47.920 --> 09:49.540
a coherent argument for self-defense.

09:49.540 --> 09:53.700
It reduces the complexity and tragedy of the original incident to absolute nothingness,

09:53.700 --> 09:57.280
to a banal and tiresome experience that is somehow impervious to semiotics.

09:57.280 --> 10:01.140
I mean, yeah, the point is that the game's a one-off joke, which is why I said earlier

10:01.140 --> 10:04.920
that it gets old once you're done laughing at the joke, but Kotaku is pretending like

10:04.920 --> 10:06.520
the joke doesn't even exist at all.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.840
Maybe because it's people like them who are getting made fun of.

10:09.840 --> 10:12.480
Compare this with how Kotaku treated Tonight We Riot.

10:12.480 --> 10:16.240
Politics has become a dirty word in gaming, especially when angrily screamed, or, as is

10:16.240 --> 10:21.600
usually the case, frantically typed by a vocal minority of reactionary video game fans.

10:21.600 --> 10:25.760
But for more progressive players, games often aren't political enough, or, when they do

10:25.760 --> 10:30.640
take a position, they push objectionable conservative concepts like capitalism, imperialism, and

10:30.640 --> 10:31.640
militarism.

10:31.640 --> 10:36.080
Tonight We Riot bucks these trends by proudly wearing its decidedly leftist ideology on

10:36.080 --> 10:39.800
its sleeve, just like Kotaku proudly wears its own leftist ideology on the front page,

10:39.800 --> 10:40.800
which is their right to do.

10:40.800 --> 10:44.400
But it also explains why their articles are consistently partisan hackery, why nobody

10:44.400 --> 10:48.440
gives a fuck about what they have to say, and why they're only just barely afloat after

10:48.440 --> 10:50.880
ten years of crisis after crisis.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.880
I can't wait until the day when we can finally piss on their grave, lads.

10:54.880 --> 10:59.960
I guess I'm just saying that I am very tired that this is how the online political meme

10:59.960 --> 11:00.960
game is played now.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.380
A friend of mine, and a supporter of my channel, has told me in private several times that

11:04.380 --> 11:08.620
whenever a game looks good, he meticulously combs over the developers for any hint of

11:08.620 --> 11:09.860
progressive toxicity.

11:09.860 --> 11:14.180
This is exactly the kind of thing that we decried them for five years ago, and they

11:14.180 --> 11:16.100
responded with everything is political.

11:16.100 --> 11:19.820
And unfortunately, now that they've made everything political, it kinda has to be.

11:19.820 --> 11:23.700
I said this recently, maybe it was in an abortion video, maybe the don't say gay one, maybe

11:23.700 --> 11:26.540
it was a weekly sip, I don't know, I've done a lot of content right now.

11:26.540 --> 11:30.900
But recently I said something like, if team A only passes the ball to members of team

11:30.900 --> 11:36.980
A, but team B passes the ball to members of teams A and B, team B will inevitably lose.

11:36.980 --> 11:40.140
As non-leftists, that is the situation that we find ourselves in.

11:40.140 --> 11:43.340
We should not be treating everything like it is political.

11:43.340 --> 11:45.300
That is the path to totalitarianism.

11:45.300 --> 11:49.140
But if the socialists and progressives continue to do so, we will lose, simply because there

11:49.140 --> 11:53.060
will be battlefields that we will not fight on, and those automatically become ceded ground

11:53.060 --> 11:54.060
to them.

11:54.060 --> 11:56.600
A neutral space cannot exist in a power vacuum.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.300
It must be cultivated and protected by the dominant power, with the full understanding

12:00.300 --> 12:04.420
that for it to be truly neutral, the power must paradoxically allow for positions within

12:04.420 --> 12:08.940
it to be contrary to his own, while simultaneously not allowing those positions to undermine

12:08.940 --> 12:10.380
the space's integrity.

12:10.380 --> 12:15.840
The difference between us and the leftists is, I hope, that we will rule with grace.

12:15.840 --> 12:18.240
We won't actually have the totalizing worldview.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.100
We will consider the value of a private life, and we won't insist that everything be made

12:22.100 --> 12:23.100
political.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.340
We will maintain that neutral space.

12:25.340 --> 12:29.580
But none of these stances mean much if the subversives are still subverting.

12:29.580 --> 12:33.420
And that means, when the commies make a shitty commie game for a quick turnaround, planting

12:33.420 --> 12:37.960
their flag on that small hill in the culture war, inevitably somebody has to come around

12:37.960 --> 12:40.900
and make a shitty Kyle Rittenhouse game for the same reason.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.460
I just wish it wasn't like this.

12:42.460 --> 12:44.020
I also wish it was a better game.
