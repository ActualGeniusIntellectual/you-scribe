1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,440
So, over on the ol' video channel, I tried out the Kyle Rittenhouse meme game that went

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,040
viral a week or two ago, acquitted Self Defense vs. the Braindead.

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,800
The story goes, you play as this generic American teenager who just so happens to look like

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Kyle Rittenhouse.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,320
He's just received his not guilty verdict for his textbook self defense killing of leftist

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
activists.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,040
And due to that highly publicized event, another horde of leftist activists have appeared at

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
the courthouse to protest.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,240
You need to defend yourself with lethal force once again until it's time for your next court

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,260
date for that killing.

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,400
The joke being that it's a top down shooter with tower defense elements.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,400
And the time in between waves of enemies is the trial judging your actions during the

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
previous wave.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
I get the joke, it's pretty clever.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,200
And the game is also full of equally clever little easter eggs.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,120
Not just the story and the fact that the kid is clearly Kyle Rittenhouse.

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,840
The zombie who attacks with a skateboard is missing his bicep, referencing the wounds

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,560
of one of the people who Kyle shot.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,920
Some zombies attack with bike locks, referencing a 2017 Berkeley riot where Eric Clanton, a

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,160
professor as part of an Antifa black bloc, hit his victims with a bike lock.

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,040
Other zombies appear to use spin kicks as their primary method of attack, referencing

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,800
a 2018 event in Toronto where a progressive soy boy kicked a pregnant woman who was filming

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,460
him during an abortion protest.

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,080
The generic female zombie is clearly Big Red, though the game randomizes her hair color

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
for flavor.

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,560
And though a lot of people are calling the first boss zombie Trigglypuff, I'm not exactly

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
seeing the connection.

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,880
The size might be there, but the hair is all wrong.

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,040
Same with the second boss zombie and the it is ma'am person.

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,340
But nonetheless, everybody can understand the stereotypes being appealed to here.

31
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,280
The soy boy hipster, the black bloc communist, the radical feminist, the ham beast, each

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,400
of them taking on this all-American kid who is cut straight from the cloth of somebody

33
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,920
like Mike from StarTropics or Zeke from Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,640
In fact, the game plays a lot like Zombies Ate My Neighbors too, both of them being top-down

35
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,840
shooters where you take on hordes of zombies.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,820
Though acquitted, not being confined to a Sega Genesis can put a whole bunch more zombies

37
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,820
on the screen.

38
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,960
In fact, the game it feels the most like, at least in so far as style is concerned,

39
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,200
is Death Road to Canada, another top-down shooter where you take on hordes of zombies.

40
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,200
But rather than being a wave-based tower defense game, Death Road to Canada is a roguelike

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,080
where the maps and the loot within are randomly generated and what events you encounter on

42
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,840
the road are also entirely random.

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,660
The reason I'm bringing all this up right now is because I know that acquitted is the

44
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,240
meme game right now and people with a more libertarian political persuasion are laughing

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,360
their heads off thinking how triggered the libs must be.

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
And you know, they are.

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,800
All you have to do is go on Twitter and see it.

48
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,680
However, a thematically similar game coming from the socialist perspective, Tonight We

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,160
Riot, came out last year and the situation was entirely reversed.

50
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,920
Terminally online commies were praising it for its humor and gameplay, and those few

51
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,720
right-leaning people who actually heard of it groaned in exasperation at yet another

52
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,380
bit of cultural subversion.

53
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,200
Each side treated each of these games exactly as expected.

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,980
I will say, though, I got acquitted on sale for five bucks, it's ten now, sorry, while

55
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,440
Tonight We Riot is fifteen.

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,040
According to the Steam database, Tonight We Riot doesn't really go on sale all that

57
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,960
much, though that one 90% discount was pretty nice.

58
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,920
The database gives us more information to look at, too.

59
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,560
The highest number of concurrent players of Tonight We Riot was its launch day with

60
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
84 people.

61
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,940
It did have a shit ton of Twitch viewers, though, but those were almost all Hassan and

62
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,500
his orbiter streaming the game.

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,440
They all played it exactly once, all at the same time, on launch day, and never touched

64
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
it again.

65
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,560
The game remained dead until acquitted came out, when people started comparing the two,

66
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,680
at which point it hit its second peak of 17 players.

67
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,100
So we can sit here and laugh at the failure of Tonight We Riot, how Hassan's massive

68
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,460
viewership probably did more to hurt than help, since it clearly didn't translate

69
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,680
into sales, and how the meagre social media presence of the game has basically devolved

70
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,860
into virtue signaling and commie posting, except that one tweet about them by Andy Ngo

71
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,660
that went viral, where they ended up hiding the only reply that called them pedophiles.

72
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,580
In other words, a bunch of online socialist game developers put a lot of work into making

73
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,900
Tonight We Riot and it turned out to be a gigantic fucking failure, and if you want

74
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,620
to have some schadenfreude at that, fine.

75
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,180
But at the same time, acquitted actually looks to be on the same trend.

76
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,400
Yeah, it got that bump from the quartering, just like Hassan gave the other one, but it

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,940
still maxed out at 137 people playing it.

78
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,340
By the way, you see that second spike in Twitch viewers right there?

79
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,260
I'm pretty sure that's Game Boomers, my gaming channel, which hey, you should be following

80
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,260
if you're watching this.

81
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,260
Let's make that spike grow.

82
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,460
But the reason I'm talking about this isn't necessarily to shit on these games, but to

83
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,660
point out a simple truth.

84
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,580
The purpose of a political meme game is to exist.

85
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,540
The actual playing of the game just seems to be secondary.

86
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,140
I've played a lot of these political meme games on the channel.

87
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:33,900
In 2016, 2018, 2020, whenever an election came around, I pulled out a few garbage-tier

88
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,320
Trump games and had a great time on stream with the audience.

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,040
Games like President Trump The Way in Uganda and Lock Her Up The Trump Supremacy only have

90
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,940
value in that you can laugh at the fact that they exist.

91
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,860
Beyond the Trump meme skin of them, their gameplay loops range from extremely shallow

92
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,240
to non-existent, they look and control like Newgrounds Flash games, and even at like a

93
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,820
dollar or less, they're not exactly worth it.

94
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,020
Probably the only good game in this niche subgenre is Mr. President, where you play

95
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,420
as a secret service agent trying to push Trump out of the way of an assassination attempt

96
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,800
while running through a ragdoll physics world.

97
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,660
And I blame this one's success on the Game Grumps, as well as the fact that ragdoll physics

98
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,620
games are themselves their own meme, separate from politics.

99
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,380
The reason that people seem to make these games, at least in my opinion, is that they're

100
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,500
hoping to go viral on Twitter or get some clickbait article in the media published about

101
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,180
them, and then use that exposure to springboard into something else, whether that be a Twitch

102
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,500
career or a gamedev career or whatever.

103
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,060
And to be honest, none of these games are actually any good.

104
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,980
Yeah, I know everyone's fawning over acquitted right now, but once the joke gets old, what

105
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,980
else is there?

106
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,900
The game becomes punishingly hard after a handful of levels, where the zombies become

107
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
bullet sponges to the point of tedium.

108
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,500
The weapons are poorly balanced, because ammo infinitely regenerates, there's never any

109
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,000
reason to use the handgun over the AR-15.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,360
There is sometimes a decent tactical choice to be made, between using the shotgun to one-shot-kill

111
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,640
a single target, or the AR-15 to spray and pray into a crowd, but that's presuming that

112
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,120
you actually find the shotgun.

113
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,020
Weapons in this game seem to appear only on specific levels.

114
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,800
Once you grab them, you have them for the rest of your save file, but if you miss them,

115
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,900
you're just shit out of luck.

116
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,040
That method of unlocking new weapons might work for an adventure game, but not really

117
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,020
for an arcade-style top-down shooter, where you expect weapons to act like power-ups with

118
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,440
limited time or ammo, not permanent unlocks.

119
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,340
In roguelikes, there are permanent unlocks that you can miss, sure, but that genre also

120
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,020
tends to have the game restart after death, so that you can have a different build in

121
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,020
each run.

122
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,620
But Equator doesn't do that either, you just restart the same level after you die.

123
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,140
During the stream, we missed picking up the sniper rifle and the battle axe weapons, and

124
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,340
I never saw either of them appear ever again.

125
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,180
Grenades also infinitely regenerate, so there's no reason to save them for when you need them.

126
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,820
All of this does lead to fast-paced, action-filled gameplay.

127
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,220
And sure, that's to the game's advantage to a point, but since you're not managing

128
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,720
limited resources, the rising difficulty of the game has to come from turning your enemies

129
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
into bullet sponges.

130
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,520
And at some point, that just stops being fun.

131
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,280
Basically, once the Kyle Rittenhouse joke wears off, you're stuck with a mediocre,

132
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,800
Newgrounds-style game you'll probably never play again.

133
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,600
For a dollar, that's probably fine, but five or ten?

134
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
Not so much, at least to me.

135
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,960
Now, maybe you just want to support artists and creators who are willing to make games

136
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
of this sort of political bent.

137
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,100
Fair enough, there aren't many of those out there right now.

138
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,580
And maybe showing them support, keeping them going, is more important than actually liking

139
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,580
their game.

140
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,520
Like I've mentioned in videos before, the left is employing Gramsci-styled cultural

141
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,160
subversion tactics right now, and frankly, one of the best ways to counteract it is with

142
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,400
your own side's cultural products, and that means funding them.

143
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,080
I guess I'm just a tiny bit sad that this is where we are.

144
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,880
These games seem to get made not necessarily to make a good game, but to appeal to terminally

145
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,620
online, always politically-engaged culture warriors who want something that they can

146
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,840
post on their social media to trigger their opponents.

147
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,480
And if enough people post it, or get triggered, then maybe a YouTuber or a streamer will make

148
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
some content about it.

149
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,360
This kind of stuff used to not be this, it used to be Flash games made for fun, not chasing

150
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,540
reactions online.

151
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,200
I'm not out here necessarily saying it, this should stop.

152
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,880
I'm not denigrating the people who made Acquitted, or the people who are enjoying playing it.

153
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,500
I'm not shitting on the quartering for making the video, even though I don't fully believe

154
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,080
him when he says the game is actually awesome.

155
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,080
The other side is doing the same damn thing, the left agitprops, the right agitprops.

156
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,480
Kotaku, being the piss rag they are, published this article.

157
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,400
Far-right developers Kyle Rittenhouse Steam Shooter is an edgy, it's embarrassing, in

158
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,320
a desperate attempt to upset the left.

159
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,360
This badly crafted shooter has nothing to say.

160
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,500
Here's a life tip from Uncle Dev, kids.

161
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,780
If somebody has little in the way of actual critique, but says this is embarrassing over

162
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,840
and over, they don't actually have anything worthwhile to say.

163
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Case in point.

164
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,640
Why can't far-right provocateurs just be good at anything?

165
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,760
Kyle Rittenhouse was charged with the fatal shooting of two men in August 2020, when he

166
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,480
fired at unarmed protesters during civil unrest in Kenosha.

167
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,480
The case in November 2021 starkly divided Americans, with the left viewing his acquittal

168
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,760
as a miscarriage of justice with racist roots, while the right saw it as a victory for the

169
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,480
right to bear arms in self-defense.

170
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,720
The chillingly named Nordic Empire Games see it, based on the available evidence, as something

171
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
to gloat about.

172
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,060
What, do you think these people are Nazis looking for the fucking Tesseract or something?

173
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,320
Wherever you land on the matter, and let's not beat around the bush, he got away with

174
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
killing people.

175
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,480
I'd hope a person's central thought would be, innocent people died, lives were ended.

176
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,240
Dude, these are people who were mindlessly rushing and attacking this kid, he got away

177
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,280
with defending himself, as he should.

178
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,040
And they weren't exactly innocent, one was a pedophile, one was a wife-beater.

179
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,960
Like, okay, it doesn't really matter regarding this, but still, Jesus Christ Kotaku, you

180
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,600
guys have been shit for over a decade, how are you still going?

181
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Look at how they frame the conversation.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,880
Nordic Empire's website makes some grand claims about the vast importance of their existence.

183
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,600
They are three young men, fully dedicated to the development of games that are fun and

184
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,120
engaging, while at the same time staying committed to what is right and true.

185
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,640
But then, why make acquitted?

186
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,200
This is a game that, despite its implied bravado, its bold declarations, doesn't make any statement.

187
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,720
Beyond a character who could be anyone, clumsily shooting at some grey-skinned zombies carrying

188
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,920
early 90's Soviet flags, it fails to defend Rittenhouse's actions, let alone portray

189
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,540
a coherent argument for self-defense.

190
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,700
It reduces the complexity and tragedy of the original incident to absolute nothingness,

191
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,280
to a banal and tiresome experience that is somehow impervious to semiotics.

192
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,140
I mean, yeah, the point is that the game's a one-off joke, which is why I said earlier

193
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,920
that it gets old once you're done laughing at the joke, but Kotaku is pretending like

194
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,520
the joke doesn't even exist at all.

195
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,840
Maybe because it's people like them who are getting made fun of.

196
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,480
Compare this with how Kotaku treated Tonight We Riot.

197
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,240
Politics has become a dirty word in gaming, especially when angrily screamed, or, as is

198
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,600
usually the case, frantically typed by a vocal minority of reactionary video game fans.

199
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,760
But for more progressive players, games often aren't political enough, or, when they do

200
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,640
take a position, they push objectionable conservative concepts like capitalism, imperialism, and

201
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
militarism.

202
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,080
Tonight We Riot bucks these trends by proudly wearing its decidedly leftist ideology on

203
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,800
its sleeve, just like Kotaku proudly wears its own leftist ideology on the front page,

204
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
which is their right to do.

205
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,400
But it also explains why their articles are consistently partisan hackery, why nobody

206
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,440
gives a fuck about what they have to say, and why they're only just barely afloat after

207
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,880
ten years of crisis after crisis.

208
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,880
I can't wait until the day when we can finally piss on their grave, lads.

209
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,960
I guess I'm just saying that I am very tired that this is how the online political meme

210
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
game is played now.

211
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,380
A friend of mine, and a supporter of my channel, has told me in private several times that

212
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,620
whenever a game looks good, he meticulously combs over the developers for any hint of

213
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,860
progressive toxicity.

214
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,180
This is exactly the kind of thing that we decried them for five years ago, and they

215
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,100
responded with everything is political.

216
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,820
And unfortunately, now that they've made everything political, it kinda has to be.

217
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,700
I said this recently, maybe it was in an abortion video, maybe the don't say gay one, maybe

218
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,540
it was a weekly sip, I don't know, I've done a lot of content right now.

219
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,900
But recently I said something like, if team A only passes the ball to members of team

220
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,980
A, but team B passes the ball to members of teams A and B, team B will inevitably lose.

221
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,140
As non-leftists, that is the situation that we find ourselves in.

222
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,340
We should not be treating everything like it is political.

223
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,300
That is the path to totalitarianism.

224
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,140
But if the socialists and progressives continue to do so, we will lose, simply because there

225
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,060
will be battlefields that we will not fight on, and those automatically become ceded ground

226
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,060
to them.

227
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,600
A neutral space cannot exist in a power vacuum.

228
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,300
It must be cultivated and protected by the dominant power, with the full understanding

229
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,420
that for it to be truly neutral, the power must paradoxically allow for positions within

230
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,940
it to be contrary to his own, while simultaneously not allowing those positions to undermine

231
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,380
the space's integrity.

232
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,840
The difference between us and the leftists is, I hope, that we will rule with grace.

233
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,240
We won't actually have the totalizing worldview.

234
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,100
We will consider the value of a private life, and we won't insist that everything be made

235
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,100
political.

236
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,340
We will maintain that neutral space.

237
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,580
But none of these stances mean much if the subversives are still subverting.

238
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,420
And that means, when the commies make a shitty commie game for a quick turnaround, planting

239
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,960
their flag on that small hill in the culture war, inevitably somebody has to come around

240
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,900
and make a shitty Kyle Rittenhouse game for the same reason.

241
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,460
I just wish it wasn't like this.

242
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,020
I also wish it was a better game.
