00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
Joe Rogan says he's voting for Bernie.

00:02.720 --> 00:05.800
Who are you going to vote for in the primary?

00:05.800 --> 00:10.040
I think I'll probably vote for Bernie.

00:10.040 --> 00:13.980
Him as a human being, when I was hanging out with him, I believe in him.

00:13.980 --> 00:14.980
I like him.

00:14.980 --> 00:15.980
I like him a lot.

00:15.980 --> 00:20.520
What Bernie stands for is a guy who, well look, you could dig up dirt on every single

00:20.520 --> 00:24.800
human being that's ever existed if you catch them in their worst moment and you magnify

00:24.800 --> 00:29.980
those moments and you cut out everything else and you only display those worst moments.

00:29.980 --> 00:34.100
That said, you can't find very many with Bernie.

00:34.100 --> 00:37.480
He's been insanely consistent his entire life.

00:37.480 --> 00:43.100
He's basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing his whole life.

00:43.100 --> 00:49.060
And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.

00:49.060 --> 00:55.220
Hey, Nathan Bernhard, haven't you been saying that Joe Rogan is far right or alt-right or

00:55.220 --> 00:57.420
whatever for a long time now?

00:57.420 --> 01:02.260
For five days straight, Joe Rogan's sympathetic interview with far-right propagandist Ben

01:02.260 --> 01:05.900
Shapiro has been the most listened to podcast in the world.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.900
Rogan is a far-right apologist.

01:07.900 --> 01:13.000
Aside from Joe Rogan expressing mild skepticism over Andy Noe's brain hemorrhage, the interview

01:13.000 --> 01:17.900
was them ranting about how Antifa are the real fascists, not Nazis.

01:17.900 --> 01:22.340
Joe unfortunately agrees with these far-right grifters on most issues.

01:22.340 --> 01:27.460
Joe Rogan appeared on Infowars yesterday to claim he's not a gateway to the far right.

01:27.460 --> 01:33.300
Previously, Rogan platformed race scientist Stefan Molyneux, Islamophobic fearmonger Ben

01:33.300 --> 01:36.900
Shapiro, and cult leader Jordan Peterson.

01:36.900 --> 01:40.820
Joe has sadly become a springboard for far-right influencers.

01:40.820 --> 01:44.900
Joe Rogan hosted far-right fearmonger Ben Shapiro on his podcast yesterday.

01:44.900 --> 01:49.660
Ben constantly whined about being labeled alt-right and Joe never pushed back.

01:49.660 --> 01:51.780
Last week, Rogan appeared on Infowars.

01:51.780 --> 01:58.020
It's a shame Joe bends over backwards to normalize these far-right maniacs.

01:58.020 --> 02:04.500
It just keeps going, guys, it just keeps going, like, holy shit, hey, hey, Nathan, how the

02:04.500 --> 02:12.580
fuck can you rationalize Joe Rogan, the far-right alt-right whatever, voting for Bernie Sanders?

02:12.580 --> 02:14.740
Maybe it's that you're an idiot.

02:14.740 --> 02:19.220
However, as you probably saw at the start of the video, Joe Rogan's endorsement was

02:19.220 --> 02:24.020
repackaged into an official campaign ad by the Bernie Sanders campaign.

02:24.020 --> 02:26.980
And people are not happy about it.

02:26.980 --> 02:32.100
Joe Rogan is a gateway to the alt-right, which is why this move will be damaging to Bernie.

02:32.740 --> 02:36.820
Now Bernie's movement will suffer an influx of Nazis who want healthcare,

02:38.500 --> 02:43.860
those Nazis and their healthcare, making its spaces unsafe for marginalized members.

02:43.860 --> 02:48.420
Rogan knows exactly what he's doing, kneecapping incipient socialism.

02:48.420 --> 02:56.100
It's more that what you call Nazis, one, aren't actually Nazis, but two, are voters,

02:56.660 --> 03:02.740
voters whom you will need the vote of if you actually want to win in 2020, you moron.

03:02.740 --> 03:06.900
If Bernie doesn't renounce Rogan's endorsement, he'll no longer be my number two.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.740
He won't even be in my top five.

03:08.740 --> 03:12.820
Signal boosting the endorsement of a man who is openly transphobic, misogynist,

03:12.820 --> 03:15.140
and a Nazi apologist is unacceptable.

03:15.140 --> 03:16.980
This is the hill I will die on.

03:16.980 --> 03:18.420
Yeah, it is the hill you will die on.

03:18.420 --> 03:20.980
With the attitude you have regarding politics,

03:20.980 --> 03:23.860
none of the people you support will ever get into office.

03:23.860 --> 03:29.220
However, more importantly, Joe Rogan isn't transphobic, or a misogynist, or a Nazi apologist.

03:29.220 --> 03:33.220
He is willing to discuss things openly rather than simply accept

03:33.220 --> 03:36.500
your side's propaganda on the face of it, which is why you don't like him.

03:36.500 --> 03:41.220
If you guys came out and said being trans means accepting position A, B, C, and D,

03:41.780 --> 03:45.780
and someone decided not to outright reject those positions, but simply

03:45.780 --> 03:49.140
debate their merits, you would call that transphobia.

03:49.140 --> 03:53.300
And I don't mean an obvious position like trans people should be allowed to be alive,

03:53.300 --> 03:54.100
or something like that.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.340
I mean something that actually has a discussion in it.

03:56.340 --> 04:00.660
Like, should trans people be allowed to compete in professional sports,

04:00.660 --> 04:05.220
specifically competing against people who were born that gender rather than transitioned?

04:06.340 --> 04:08.980
There's a legitimate conversation to be had there,

04:08.980 --> 04:12.740
but you think having the conversation means that you're transphobic,

04:12.740 --> 04:14.980
which is again, why you are wrong.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.740
Here's Peter, I married a blow-up doll coffin.

04:18.740 --> 04:22.260
Legitimizing Joe Rogan is not something that has been done by leftists on Twitter

04:22.260 --> 04:23.460
in the last 48 hours.

04:23.460 --> 04:24.740
It happened years ago.

04:24.740 --> 04:26.580
He has 11 million listeners.

04:26.580 --> 04:27.940
That ship has sailed.

04:27.940 --> 04:30.660
It's time to try to persuade those people of something.

04:30.660 --> 04:32.980
You know, on the one hand, I do love the idea

04:32.980 --> 04:36.500
that we could lay all of this at the feet of Fear Factor, or something.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.340
On the other, though, Peter Coffin's actually right.

04:39.060 --> 04:41.060
Joe Rogan has 11 million listeners.

04:41.060 --> 04:45.620
If you want to get them on side, you have to treat them seriously,

04:45.620 --> 04:49.140
and not just simply call them racists or whatever.

04:49.140 --> 04:54.260
Bernie Sanders must reconsider Joe Rogan's endorsement, says LGBTQ group.

04:54.980 --> 04:59.940
Human Rights Campaign says podcast host Rogan has attacked countless marginalized groups

04:59.940 --> 05:01.460
at every opportunity.

05:01.460 --> 05:04.900
And of course, put in the least flattering picture of Bernie you can get.

05:04.980 --> 05:05.620
Yeah, no.

05:06.420 --> 05:11.060
A purity spiral is the opposite of what you want to have when you're trying to win an election.

05:11.060 --> 05:16.420
You have to have a broad tent that covers a lot of people with a lot of different views.

05:16.420 --> 05:17.540
That's how you win.

05:17.540 --> 05:20.820
And in fact, that is exactly what Bernie's campaign said, to their credit.

05:21.380 --> 05:25.220
The goal of our campaign is to build a multiracial, multigenerational movement

05:25.220 --> 05:28.580
that is large enough to defeat Donald Trump and the powerful special interest

05:28.580 --> 05:32.260
whose greed and corruption is the root cause of the outrageous inequality in America.

05:32.260 --> 05:37.300
Sharing a big tent requires including those who do not share every one of our beliefs,

05:37.300 --> 05:40.340
while always making clear that we will never compromise our values.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.980
The truth is that by standing together in solidarity,

05:42.980 --> 05:45.140
we share the values of love and respect

05:45.140 --> 05:48.260
that will move us in the direction of a more humane, more equal world.

05:48.260 --> 05:51.620
Now you can object to a lot of the rhetoric used in that passage.

05:51.620 --> 05:53.300
There's certainly some problems with it.

05:53.300 --> 05:57.700
But the point is, we will not reject Joe Rogan's endorsement,

05:57.700 --> 06:01.060
simply because a far left vocal fringe doesn't like it.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.620
And that is the right thing to do in this situation.

06:03.620 --> 06:05.940
This is a pathetic response and I'm done.

06:05.940 --> 06:10.580
It is clear the Bernie Sanders campaign does not care about holding transphobia accountable.

06:10.580 --> 06:14.660
Among the many other awful things Joe Rogan has perpetuated on his program,

06:14.660 --> 06:16.500
I am a human being and a trans person.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.940
I am not another belief.

06:17.940 --> 06:20.900
The problem, and this is I think a problem with a lot of trans activists,

06:20.900 --> 06:24.340
is that they equate their humanity with their activism.

06:24.340 --> 06:27.620
So for example, if you reject some of their political opinions,

06:27.620 --> 06:32.340
they take it as if it is a dangerous direct assault on their very life.

06:32.340 --> 06:35.700
It's not, obviously, but that's how they get away with rhetoric like this.

06:35.700 --> 06:39.380
Oh, and also, you work for the Hillary Clinton campaign.

06:39.380 --> 06:42.020
You're just fucking angry that you lost in 2016

06:42.020 --> 06:45.380
because Hillary decided to fight against the activist wing of her own party.

06:45.380 --> 06:47.380
Feel free to stay mad about it.

06:47.380 --> 06:52.180
But there are idiots out there who actually think this is about gender somehow.

06:52.180 --> 06:53.860
Hillary must be quiet.

06:53.860 --> 06:55.700
Joe Rogan must be boosted.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.420
It's like a seminar on the role of gender in US politics.

06:58.420 --> 07:01.540
Well, firstly, Hillary's not even in the fucking campaign.

07:01.540 --> 07:05.300
And that might be a good thing for Democrats, because if she entered, she'd lose again.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.780
But secondly, it's not about their gender at all.

07:07.780 --> 07:09.620
In fact, it's the opposite of that.

07:09.620 --> 07:14.180
Joe Rogan is considered evil because he's a man who has made some problematic jokes,

07:14.180 --> 07:16.740
and maybe he smoked weed with Elon Musk on air,

07:16.740 --> 07:21.220
and maybe he's debated distasteful ideas rather than simply running away from them scared.

07:21.220 --> 07:24.180
Hillary, the literal fucking neoliberal warmonger,

07:24.180 --> 07:28.660
who went on a radio show where they used to quiz mentally disabled people back in the 90s

07:28.660 --> 07:31.860
on how to spell simple words they didn't understand.

07:31.860 --> 07:34.500
She's good because she is a woman.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.060
This is why identity politics will always lead you to ruin,

07:37.060 --> 07:39.780
in politics, in business, in science.

07:39.780 --> 07:40.660
Doesn't matter.

07:40.660 --> 07:46.340
Only 53% of Bernie Sanders voters will definitely support the 2020 Democratic nomination.

07:47.780 --> 07:48.340
Infinite.

07:48.340 --> 07:49.060
Yikes.

07:49.060 --> 07:49.940
No, no, no, no, no.

07:49.940 --> 07:51.860
This is not the time to moralize.

07:52.340 --> 07:55.300
This is not the time to browbeat people into going your way

07:55.300 --> 07:58.180
because you can't shame somebody into voting for your candidate.

07:58.180 --> 08:02.180
This is the time to reconcile and make deals with people, all right?

08:02.180 --> 08:04.100
You will lose with this attitude.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.060
If your response to the people who say Bernie or Bust

08:07.060 --> 08:12.180
is to call them racists or sexist or bigots or whatever, you will lose them.

08:12.180 --> 08:14.260
If your response is to cut a deal with them,

08:14.260 --> 08:16.660
maybe include some of their policies on your platform,

08:16.660 --> 08:20.820
and maybe make Bernie like the Secretary of State or something, you could figure it out,

08:20.820 --> 08:22.900
then maybe you get more of them on board.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.300
But this, this is how you lose.

08:25.300 --> 08:29.220
Joe Rogan back in 2012, call me romantic,

08:29.220 --> 08:33.540
but I love when gay guys on a date are comfortable enough to kiss in public.

08:33.540 --> 08:38.180
In the Democratic Party, we do not fetishize LGBTQ plus folks.

08:38.180 --> 08:42.340
When they show affection in a public place, it is not for your pleasure.

08:42.340 --> 08:46.340
Bernie Sanders, delete this tweet and renounce Joe Rogan's endorsement.

08:46.340 --> 08:52.820
Can you, can you imagine like Joe Rogan just furiously masturbating

08:52.820 --> 08:55.620
over like a gay public displays of affection fetish?

08:57.140 --> 09:02.740
This is, this is the most reaching I have ever seen anyone do in quite some time.

09:02.740 --> 09:04.500
Here's something to think about though.

09:04.500 --> 09:08.980
If Joe Rogan actually is this, this, this gateway to the alt-right,

09:08.980 --> 09:11.620
if he, you know, he platforms the far right and therefore

09:11.620 --> 09:13.780
legitimizes them and all this other bullshit,

09:13.780 --> 09:19.700
then what does it say about him when he has Bernie Sanders on his, his podcast for an hour?

09:19.700 --> 09:23.940
And what does it say about him when he endorses Bernie Sanders after that podcast?

09:23.940 --> 09:27.460
Does that make him a, a gateway towards Bernie?

09:27.460 --> 09:30.580
Does that mean that he is a pipeline to, to the alt-left?

09:30.580 --> 09:32.020
In fact, people are saying the opposite.

09:32.020 --> 09:36.180
People are saying that they don't want Joe Rogan's audience to enter the far left.

09:36.180 --> 09:39.860
They don't want Joe Rogan's audience to, to be a part of Bernie's campaign.

09:39.860 --> 09:42.660
So if you don't want people radicalized towards the right,

09:42.660 --> 09:45.220
and you don't want people radicalized towards the left,

09:45.220 --> 09:47.700
and we already know that you have no love for the centrists,

09:48.420 --> 09:52.740
what do you want to do with all of those people that don't politically agree with you?

09:52.740 --> 09:56.020
If you don't want to convert them, if you don't want to leave them alone,

09:56.020 --> 09:59.140
and if you don't want them to, to radicalize to be your enemy,

09:59.140 --> 10:00.660
what do you want to do with them?

10:00.660 --> 10:01.140
I don't know.

10:01.940 --> 10:04.820
Maybe everyone in the far left is actually a legit tanky

10:04.820 --> 10:07.700
that just wants to put all of them in gulags or something.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.900
Maybe they actually want to see their, their political opposition dead.

10:10.900 --> 10:14.100
Like, I don't know, possibly like what else is left?

10:14.100 --> 10:16.900
Let's say Joe Rogan's audience is actually alt-right.

10:17.540 --> 10:22.260
And let's say some of those alt-right people have been convinced by Joe Rogan's podcast

10:22.260 --> 10:26.820
and endorsement of Bernie to maybe swing a bit more left in their politics

10:26.820 --> 10:29.220
and, and, and vote for Bernie this time around.

10:29.220 --> 10:30.500
Is that not a victory?

10:30.500 --> 10:35.140
How could you justify screaming that your marginalized communities are now unsafe

10:35.140 --> 10:39.300
as more people who used to be alt-right join your marginalized communities

10:39.300 --> 10:41.060
because they now agree with your politics?

10:41.060 --> 10:44.020
Is it because you believe that there's something innate in those people

10:44.020 --> 10:46.900
that just makes them incompatible with, with your movement?

10:46.900 --> 10:50.820
Or, I mean, maybe you just want to have an eternal enemy that you can always fight.

10:50.820 --> 10:53.140
Maybe instead of actually growing your political movement,

10:53.140 --> 10:56.100
maybe instead of actually growing the left as a whole,

10:56.100 --> 10:58.180
you just want your exclusive club.

10:58.180 --> 11:01.860
Have you guys even realized that if Bernie were to get everything he wanted,

11:02.420 --> 11:06.580
all of those gamergate dude bros that you hate would also get universal healthcare,

11:06.580 --> 11:09.460
because that's the point of universal healthcare.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.740
And just in case you had any doubts that this is at least partially about Hillary,

11:12.740 --> 11:19.540
here is HRC president Alfonso David basically calling for Joe Rogan to, to be cancel cultured.

11:19.540 --> 11:20.580
I mean, good luck with that.

11:20.580 --> 11:24.020
His, his YouTube channel is certainly larger than anything

11:24.660 --> 11:26.420
that the mainstream media puts out anymore.

11:26.420 --> 11:28.340
And really, I think that's what this is all about.

11:28.340 --> 11:31.860
It doesn't matter whether or not you agree with Bernie Sanders' platform.

11:31.860 --> 11:36.020
What matters is that he's getting the endorsement not of news organizations,

11:36.020 --> 11:37.300
but of content creators.

11:37.300 --> 11:40.020
He's strangely enough streaming on Twitch.

11:40.020 --> 11:41.460
He's talking to Joe Rogan.

11:41.460 --> 11:42.980
He's going on other podcasts.

11:42.980 --> 11:48.340
And he's, he's actually engaging with, with these alternative methods of communication.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.620
And the media doesn't like that he's sidestepping them for new tech.

11:51.620 --> 11:57.380
The honest truth is YouTubers are kingmakers in a way that the media used to be 30 years ago.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.420
And now they're not.

11:58.420 --> 12:00.340
Nobody cares about what CNN has to say anymore.

12:00.340 --> 12:01.700
CNN is a dying brand.

12:01.700 --> 12:05.220
And at this point, we've kind of moved away from Joe Rogan and Bernie Sanders.

12:05.220 --> 12:08.900
And that's because the truth of the matter is around 30 years ago,

12:08.900 --> 12:12.740
the news media held dominion over whatever information that you,

12:12.740 --> 12:16.820
that you received regarding any affair that was happening like outside of your town.

12:16.820 --> 12:22.020
You basically had to watch their 15-second sound bites and listen to their very meaningless

12:22.020 --> 12:24.740
interviews giving a very basic overview of the situation.

12:25.380 --> 12:28.180
But nowadays, people are going to Joe Rogan instead.

12:28.180 --> 12:29.700
They're going to other podcasters.

12:29.700 --> 12:32.340
They're listening to things either, either like on their phones.

12:32.340 --> 12:34.980
It's like a podcast, or they're listening to the YouTube video.

12:35.780 --> 12:37.140
They don't even watch Joe Rogan.

12:37.140 --> 12:41.620
They just put them on in the background, and they listen while they're doing the dishes,

12:41.620 --> 12:44.660
or they're working out, or they're playing video games, or something.

12:44.660 --> 12:48.660
They're basically listening to these two-hour, these three-hour conversations,

12:48.660 --> 12:54.900
where they actually take a deep dive into a topic with a guest.

12:54.900 --> 12:59.700
And not just give a 15-second sound bite, but really discuss something in depth.

12:59.700 --> 13:02.900
And because of the internet, people are becoming educated in ways that

13:02.900 --> 13:05.060
were never possible 20, 30 years ago.

13:05.060 --> 13:07.540
And it's not just Joe Rogan, and it's not just podcasting.

13:07.540 --> 13:10.660
For example, academia is shifting away from the university as well.

13:11.380 --> 13:16.900
There's no reason to pay thousands of dollars to attend one of Jordan Peterson's classes

13:16.900 --> 13:20.420
over the course of a semester when you can just go and watch all the lectures on YouTube.

13:20.420 --> 13:21.300
They're all there.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.540
You'll get 90% of the same content.

13:23.540 --> 13:29.860
So things like news and politics and academics have all been, for most of human history,

13:29.860 --> 13:32.900
within a very tight, confined structure.

13:32.900 --> 13:35.540
And the internet has basically set them free.

13:35.540 --> 13:39.780
And so people are now accessing crazy amounts of information, and crazy amounts of knowledge,

13:39.780 --> 13:42.740
and getting educated in ways that have never been possible before.

13:43.380 --> 13:47.460
And the people who used to be the old gatekeepers of those things, they don't like it.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.460
Now there's obviously the problem of accreditation.

13:50.180 --> 13:55.860
What happens if you decide to take all of your classes online and just watch the lectures on

13:55.860 --> 13:56.660
YouTube?

13:56.660 --> 14:00.500
Like, how does somebody know that you actually learned all that stuff?

14:00.500 --> 14:05.060
That's why you have to get a degree or a diploma, because those things are basically proof that

14:05.060 --> 14:06.740
you learned what you say you learned.

14:06.740 --> 14:09.540
And currently, that doesn't exist online, so who knows?

14:09.540 --> 14:13.620
Even in terms of news, how do you know that the YouTubers you watch are factually accurate?

14:13.620 --> 14:18.740
You know, I tend to watch Sargon and Styx and Chew on Head, or even people I disagree with,

14:18.740 --> 14:19.700
like ContraPoints.

14:19.700 --> 14:22.900
I regularly watch people that I disagree with so that I'm not stuck in an echo chamber.

14:22.900 --> 14:26.580
I can actually synthesize the truth out of all of these various different sources.

14:26.580 --> 14:28.180
But not everyone has time for that.

14:28.180 --> 14:29.860
Not everyone has the inclination for that.

14:29.860 --> 14:34.260
Some people just really want to be in an echo chamber where they're only told things that

14:34.260 --> 14:35.300
they actually agree with.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.380
How do you solve those problems online?

14:37.380 --> 14:38.340
I'm not sure.

14:38.340 --> 14:42.180
But the old solution was simply the authority of the source.

14:42.180 --> 14:47.300
So when CNN said, you can trust us, we're giving you the news, you know, 30 years ago,

14:47.300 --> 14:49.300
that did fly for better or worse.

14:49.300 --> 14:53.940
And the reason it doesn't now is because journalists have proven themselves to no longer

14:53.940 --> 14:55.940
be worthy of the public's trust.

14:55.940 --> 15:00.020
And so that trust is now shifting away from them to content creators.

15:00.020 --> 15:05.300
So the news establishment is losing its mind that some kid with a webcam has just as much

15:05.300 --> 15:06.260
reach as they do.

15:06.260 --> 15:10.900
And meanwhile, larger sources like Sargon or Styx, they have significantly more reach

15:10.900 --> 15:12.900
than CNN or MSNBC.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.660
With, by the way, a lot less overhead.

15:14.660 --> 15:19.220
This also explains why the news establishment is being in lockstep with the political establishment.

15:20.020 --> 15:24.740
It no longer matters if Bernie Sanders gets 30 seconds on CNN and manages to pull some

15:24.740 --> 15:27.780
kind of corporate endorsement or some kind of news endorsement or whatever.

15:27.780 --> 15:31.460
You can hop on Joe Rogan for an hour, talk about his platform in depth and then get an

15:31.460 --> 15:32.580
endorsement because of it.

15:32.580 --> 15:33.460
And here's the thing.

15:33.460 --> 15:38.500
I'm reasonably certain that Joe Rogan's endorsement wasn't paid for by Bernie Sanders.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.580
That makes it his actual opinion.

15:40.580 --> 15:46.260
And if it's his actual opinion, it has a lot more weight than some kind of backroom deal.

15:46.340 --> 15:50.980
Basically, even though there's problems with authenticity and accreditation and what the

15:50.980 --> 15:55.300
news media rightfully does sometimes call fake news, despite all of those problems,

15:55.300 --> 15:59.460
things are generally getting better for your average person who wants to learn about stuff.

15:59.460 --> 16:04.340
And a side effect of it getting better is that the old gatekeepers can no longer gatekeep,

16:04.340 --> 16:06.420
which is why they are losing their minds.

16:06.420 --> 16:11.060
So when Joe Rogan endorses Bernie Sanders, regardless of how you feel about Bernie Sanders

16:11.060 --> 16:14.260
politics, it's generally a good thing because it's not a political move.

16:14.260 --> 16:16.820
It is the truth as Joe Rogan sees it.

16:16.820 --> 16:21.620
And if there's one thing that the establishment absolutely cannot tolerate, it's the truth.
