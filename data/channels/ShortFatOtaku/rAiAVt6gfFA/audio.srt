1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Joe Rogan says he's voting for Bernie.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,800
Who are you going to vote for in the primary?

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,040
I think I'll probably vote for Bernie.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,980
Him as a human being, when I was hanging out with him, I believe in him.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,980
I like him.

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,980
I like him a lot.

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,520
What Bernie stands for is a guy who, well look, you could dig up dirt on every single

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,800
human being that's ever existed if you catch them in their worst moment and you magnify

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,980
those moments and you cut out everything else and you only display those worst moments.

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,100
That said, you can't find very many with Bernie.

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,480
He's been insanely consistent his entire life.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,100
He's basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing his whole life.

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,060
And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:55,220
Hey, Nathan Bernhard, haven't you been saying that Joe Rogan is far right or alt-right or

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,420
whatever for a long time now?

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,260
For five days straight, Joe Rogan's sympathetic interview with far-right propagandist Ben

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,900
Shapiro has been the most listened to podcast in the world.

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,900
Rogan is a far-right apologist.

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,000
Aside from Joe Rogan expressing mild skepticism over Andy Noe's brain hemorrhage, the interview

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,900
was them ranting about how Antifa are the real fascists, not Nazis.

21
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,340
Joe unfortunately agrees with these far-right grifters on most issues.

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,460
Joe Rogan appeared on Infowars yesterday to claim he's not a gateway to the far right.

23
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:33,300
Previously, Rogan platformed race scientist Stefan Molyneux, Islamophobic fearmonger Ben

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,900
Shapiro, and cult leader Jordan Peterson.

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,820
Joe has sadly become a springboard for far-right influencers.

26
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,900
Joe Rogan hosted far-right fearmonger Ben Shapiro on his podcast yesterday.

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,660
Ben constantly whined about being labeled alt-right and Joe never pushed back.

28
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,780
Last week, Rogan appeared on Infowars.

29
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:58,020
It's a shame Joe bends over backwards to normalize these far-right maniacs.

30
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,500
It just keeps going, guys, it just keeps going, like, holy shit, hey, hey, Nathan, how the

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:12,580
fuck can you rationalize Joe Rogan, the far-right alt-right whatever, voting for Bernie Sanders?

32
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,740
Maybe it's that you're an idiot.

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,220
However, as you probably saw at the start of the video, Joe Rogan's endorsement was

34
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,020
repackaged into an official campaign ad by the Bernie Sanders campaign.

35
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,980
And people are not happy about it.

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,100
Joe Rogan is a gateway to the alt-right, which is why this move will be damaging to Bernie.

37
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,820
Now Bernie's movement will suffer an influx of Nazis who want healthcare,

38
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,860
those Nazis and their healthcare, making its spaces unsafe for marginalized members.

39
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,420
Rogan knows exactly what he's doing, kneecapping incipient socialism.

40
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:56,100
It's more that what you call Nazis, one, aren't actually Nazis, but two, are voters,

41
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:02,740
voters whom you will need the vote of if you actually want to win in 2020, you moron.

42
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,900
If Bernie doesn't renounce Rogan's endorsement, he'll no longer be my number two.

43
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,740
He won't even be in my top five.

44
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,820
Signal boosting the endorsement of a man who is openly transphobic, misogynist,

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,140
and a Nazi apologist is unacceptable.

46
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,980
This is the hill I will die on.

47
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,420
Yeah, it is the hill you will die on.

48
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,980
With the attitude you have regarding politics,

49
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,860
none of the people you support will ever get into office.

50
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,220
However, more importantly, Joe Rogan isn't transphobic, or a misogynist, or a Nazi apologist.

51
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,220
He is willing to discuss things openly rather than simply accept

52
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,500
your side's propaganda on the face of it, which is why you don't like him.

53
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,220
If you guys came out and said being trans means accepting position A, B, C, and D,

54
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,780
and someone decided not to outright reject those positions, but simply

55
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,140
debate their merits, you would call that transphobia.

56
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,300
And I don't mean an obvious position like trans people should be allowed to be alive,

57
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,100
or something like that.

58
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,340
I mean something that actually has a discussion in it.

59
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,660
Like, should trans people be allowed to compete in professional sports,

60
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,220
specifically competing against people who were born that gender rather than transitioned?

61
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,980
There's a legitimate conversation to be had there,

62
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,740
but you think having the conversation means that you're transphobic,

63
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,980
which is again, why you are wrong.

64
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,740
Here's Peter, I married a blow-up doll coffin.

65
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,260
Legitimizing Joe Rogan is not something that has been done by leftists on Twitter

66
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,460
in the last 48 hours.

67
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,740
It happened years ago.

68
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,580
He has 11 million listeners.

69
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,940
That ship has sailed.

70
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,660
It's time to try to persuade those people of something.

71
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,980
You know, on the one hand, I do love the idea

72
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,500
that we could lay all of this at the feet of Fear Factor, or something.

73
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,340
On the other, though, Peter Coffin's actually right.

74
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,060
Joe Rogan has 11 million listeners.

75
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,620
If you want to get them on side, you have to treat them seriously,

76
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,140
and not just simply call them racists or whatever.

77
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,260
Bernie Sanders must reconsider Joe Rogan's endorsement, says LGBTQ group.

78
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,940
Human Rights Campaign says podcast host Rogan has attacked countless marginalized groups

79
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,460
at every opportunity.

80
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,900
And of course, put in the least flattering picture of Bernie you can get.

81
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,620
Yeah, no.

82
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,060
A purity spiral is the opposite of what you want to have when you're trying to win an election.

83
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,420
You have to have a broad tent that covers a lot of people with a lot of different views.

84
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,540
That's how you win.

85
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,820
And in fact, that is exactly what Bernie's campaign said, to their credit.

86
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,220
The goal of our campaign is to build a multiracial, multigenerational movement

87
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,580
that is large enough to defeat Donald Trump and the powerful special interest

88
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,260
whose greed and corruption is the root cause of the outrageous inequality in America.

89
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,300
Sharing a big tent requires including those who do not share every one of our beliefs,

90
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,340
while always making clear that we will never compromise our values.

91
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,980
The truth is that by standing together in solidarity,

92
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,140
we share the values of love and respect

93
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,260
that will move us in the direction of a more humane, more equal world.

94
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,620
Now you can object to a lot of the rhetoric used in that passage.

95
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,300
There's certainly some problems with it.

96
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,700
But the point is, we will not reject Joe Rogan's endorsement,

97
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,060
simply because a far left vocal fringe doesn't like it.

98
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,620
And that is the right thing to do in this situation.

99
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,940
This is a pathetic response and I'm done.

100
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,580
It is clear the Bernie Sanders campaign does not care about holding transphobia accountable.

101
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,660
Among the many other awful things Joe Rogan has perpetuated on his program,

102
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,500
I am a human being and a trans person.

103
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,940
I am not another belief.

104
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,900
The problem, and this is I think a problem with a lot of trans activists,

105
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,340
is that they equate their humanity with their activism.

106
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,620
So for example, if you reject some of their political opinions,

107
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,340
they take it as if it is a dangerous direct assault on their very life.

108
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,700
It's not, obviously, but that's how they get away with rhetoric like this.

109
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,380
Oh, and also, you work for the Hillary Clinton campaign.

110
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,020
You're just fucking angry that you lost in 2016

111
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,380
because Hillary decided to fight against the activist wing of her own party.

112
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,380
Feel free to stay mad about it.

113
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,180
But there are idiots out there who actually think this is about gender somehow.

114
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,860
Hillary must be quiet.

115
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,700
Joe Rogan must be boosted.

116
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,420
It's like a seminar on the role of gender in US politics.

117
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,540
Well, firstly, Hillary's not even in the fucking campaign.

118
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,300
And that might be a good thing for Democrats, because if she entered, she'd lose again.

119
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,780
But secondly, it's not about their gender at all.

120
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,620
In fact, it's the opposite of that.

121
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,180
Joe Rogan is considered evil because he's a man who has made some problematic jokes,

122
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,740
and maybe he smoked weed with Elon Musk on air,

123
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,220
and maybe he's debated distasteful ideas rather than simply running away from them scared.

124
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,180
Hillary, the literal fucking neoliberal warmonger,

125
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,660
who went on a radio show where they used to quiz mentally disabled people back in the 90s

126
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,860
on how to spell simple words they didn't understand.

127
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,500
She's good because she is a woman.

128
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,060
This is why identity politics will always lead you to ruin,

129
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,780
in politics, in business, in science.

130
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,660
Doesn't matter.

131
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,340
Only 53% of Bernie Sanders voters will definitely support the 2020 Democratic nomination.

132
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,340
Infinite.

133
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,060
Yikes.

134
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,940
No, no, no, no, no.

135
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,860
This is not the time to moralize.

136
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,300
This is not the time to browbeat people into going your way

137
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,180
because you can't shame somebody into voting for your candidate.

138
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,180
This is the time to reconcile and make deals with people, all right?

139
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,100
You will lose with this attitude.

140
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,060
If your response to the people who say Bernie or Bust

141
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,180
is to call them racists or sexist or bigots or whatever, you will lose them.

142
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,260
If your response is to cut a deal with them,

143
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,660
maybe include some of their policies on your platform,

144
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,820
and maybe make Bernie like the Secretary of State or something, you could figure it out,

145
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,900
then maybe you get more of them on board.

146
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,300
But this, this is how you lose.

147
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,220
Joe Rogan back in 2012, call me romantic,

148
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,540
but I love when gay guys on a date are comfortable enough to kiss in public.

149
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,180
In the Democratic Party, we do not fetishize LGBTQ plus folks.

150
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,340
When they show affection in a public place, it is not for your pleasure.

151
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,340
Bernie Sanders, delete this tweet and renounce Joe Rogan's endorsement.

152
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:52,820
Can you, can you imagine like Joe Rogan just furiously masturbating

153
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,620
over like a gay public displays of affection fetish?

154
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,740
This is, this is the most reaching I have ever seen anyone do in quite some time.

155
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,500
Here's something to think about though.

156
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,980
If Joe Rogan actually is this, this, this gateway to the alt-right,

157
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,620
if he, you know, he platforms the far right and therefore

158
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,780
legitimizes them and all this other bullshit,

159
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,700
then what does it say about him when he has Bernie Sanders on his, his podcast for an hour?

160
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,940
And what does it say about him when he endorses Bernie Sanders after that podcast?

161
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,460
Does that make him a, a gateway towards Bernie?

162
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,580
Does that mean that he is a pipeline to, to the alt-left?

163
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,020
In fact, people are saying the opposite.

164
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,180
People are saying that they don't want Joe Rogan's audience to enter the far left.

165
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,860
They don't want Joe Rogan's audience to, to be a part of Bernie's campaign.

166
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,660
So if you don't want people radicalized towards the right,

167
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,220
and you don't want people radicalized towards the left,

168
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,700
and we already know that you have no love for the centrists,

169
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,740
what do you want to do with all of those people that don't politically agree with you?

170
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,020
If you don't want to convert them, if you don't want to leave them alone,

171
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,140
and if you don't want them to, to radicalize to be your enemy,

172
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,660
what do you want to do with them?

173
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,140
I don't know.

174
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,820
Maybe everyone in the far left is actually a legit tanky

175
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,700
that just wants to put all of them in gulags or something.

176
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,900
Maybe they actually want to see their, their political opposition dead.

177
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,100
Like, I don't know, possibly like what else is left?

178
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,900
Let's say Joe Rogan's audience is actually alt-right.

179
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,260
And let's say some of those alt-right people have been convinced by Joe Rogan's podcast

180
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,820
and endorsement of Bernie to maybe swing a bit more left in their politics

181
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,220
and, and, and vote for Bernie this time around.

182
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,500
Is that not a victory?

183
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,140
How could you justify screaming that your marginalized communities are now unsafe

184
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,300
as more people who used to be alt-right join your marginalized communities

185
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,060
because they now agree with your politics?

186
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,020
Is it because you believe that there's something innate in those people

187
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,900
that just makes them incompatible with, with your movement?

188
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,820
Or, I mean, maybe you just want to have an eternal enemy that you can always fight.

189
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,140
Maybe instead of actually growing your political movement,

190
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,100
maybe instead of actually growing the left as a whole,

191
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,180
you just want your exclusive club.

192
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,860
Have you guys even realized that if Bernie were to get everything he wanted,

193
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,580
all of those gamergate dude bros that you hate would also get universal healthcare,

194
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,460
because that's the point of universal healthcare.

195
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,740
And just in case you had any doubts that this is at least partially about Hillary,

196
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:19,540
here is HRC president Alfonso David basically calling for Joe Rogan to, to be cancel cultured.

197
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,580
I mean, good luck with that.

198
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,020
His, his YouTube channel is certainly larger than anything

199
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,420
that the mainstream media puts out anymore.

200
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,340
And really, I think that's what this is all about.

201
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,860
It doesn't matter whether or not you agree with Bernie Sanders' platform.

202
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,020
What matters is that he's getting the endorsement not of news organizations,

203
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,300
but of content creators.

204
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,020
He's strangely enough streaming on Twitch.

205
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,460
He's talking to Joe Rogan.

206
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,980
He's going on other podcasts.

207
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:48,340
And he's, he's actually engaging with, with these alternative methods of communication.

208
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,620
And the media doesn't like that he's sidestepping them for new tech.

209
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,380
The honest truth is YouTubers are kingmakers in a way that the media used to be 30 years ago.

210
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,420
And now they're not.

211
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,340
Nobody cares about what CNN has to say anymore.

212
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,700
CNN is a dying brand.

213
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,220
And at this point, we've kind of moved away from Joe Rogan and Bernie Sanders.

214
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,900
And that's because the truth of the matter is around 30 years ago,

215
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,740
the news media held dominion over whatever information that you,

216
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,820
that you received regarding any affair that was happening like outside of your town.

217
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:22,020
You basically had to watch their 15-second sound bites and listen to their very meaningless

218
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,740
interviews giving a very basic overview of the situation.

219
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,180
But nowadays, people are going to Joe Rogan instead.

220
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,700
They're going to other podcasters.

221
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,340
They're listening to things either, either like on their phones.

222
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,980
It's like a podcast, or they're listening to the YouTube video.

223
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,140
They don't even watch Joe Rogan.

224
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,620
They just put them on in the background, and they listen while they're doing the dishes,

225
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,660
or they're working out, or they're playing video games, or something.

226
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,660
They're basically listening to these two-hour, these three-hour conversations,

227
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:54,900
where they actually take a deep dive into a topic with a guest.

228
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,700
And not just give a 15-second sound bite, but really discuss something in depth.

229
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,900
And because of the internet, people are becoming educated in ways that

230
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,060
were never possible 20, 30 years ago.

231
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,540
And it's not just Joe Rogan, and it's not just podcasting.

232
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,660
For example, academia is shifting away from the university as well.

233
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,900
There's no reason to pay thousands of dollars to attend one of Jordan Peterson's classes

234
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,420
over the course of a semester when you can just go and watch all the lectures on YouTube.

235
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,300
They're all there.

236
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,540
You'll get 90% of the same content.

237
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:29,860
So things like news and politics and academics have all been, for most of human history,

238
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,900
within a very tight, confined structure.

239
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,540
And the internet has basically set them free.

240
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,780
And so people are now accessing crazy amounts of information, and crazy amounts of knowledge,

241
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,740
and getting educated in ways that have never been possible before.

242
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,460
And the people who used to be the old gatekeepers of those things, they don't like it.

243
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,460
Now there's obviously the problem of accreditation.

244
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,860
What happens if you decide to take all of your classes online and just watch the lectures on

245
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,660
YouTube?

246
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,500
Like, how does somebody know that you actually learned all that stuff?

247
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,060
That's why you have to get a degree or a diploma, because those things are basically proof that

248
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,740
you learned what you say you learned.

249
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,540
And currently, that doesn't exist online, so who knows?

250
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,620
Even in terms of news, how do you know that the YouTubers you watch are factually accurate?

251
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,740
You know, I tend to watch Sargon and Styx and Chew on Head, or even people I disagree with,

252
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,700
like ContraPoints.

253
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,900
I regularly watch people that I disagree with so that I'm not stuck in an echo chamber.

254
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,580
I can actually synthesize the truth out of all of these various different sources.

255
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,180
But not everyone has time for that.

256
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,860
Not everyone has the inclination for that.

257
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,260
Some people just really want to be in an echo chamber where they're only told things that

258
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,300
they actually agree with.

259
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,380
How do you solve those problems online?

260
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,340
I'm not sure.

261
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,180
But the old solution was simply the authority of the source.

262
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,300
So when CNN said, you can trust us, we're giving you the news, you know, 30 years ago,

263
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
that did fly for better or worse.

264
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,940
And the reason it doesn't now is because journalists have proven themselves to no longer

265
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,940
be worthy of the public's trust.

266
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,020
And so that trust is now shifting away from them to content creators.

267
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:05,300
So the news establishment is losing its mind that some kid with a webcam has just as much

268
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,260
reach as they do.

269
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,900
And meanwhile, larger sources like Sargon or Styx, they have significantly more reach

270
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,900
than CNN or MSNBC.

271
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,660
With, by the way, a lot less overhead.

272
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,220
This also explains why the news establishment is being in lockstep with the political establishment.

273
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,740
It no longer matters if Bernie Sanders gets 30 seconds on CNN and manages to pull some

274
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,780
kind of corporate endorsement or some kind of news endorsement or whatever.

275
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,460
You can hop on Joe Rogan for an hour, talk about his platform in depth and then get an

276
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,580
endorsement because of it.

277
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,460
And here's the thing.

278
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm reasonably certain that Joe Rogan's endorsement wasn't paid for by Bernie Sanders.

279
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,580
That makes it his actual opinion.

280
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:46,260
And if it's his actual opinion, it has a lot more weight than some kind of backroom deal.

281
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,980
Basically, even though there's problems with authenticity and accreditation and what the

282
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,300
news media rightfully does sometimes call fake news, despite all of those problems,

283
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,460
things are generally getting better for your average person who wants to learn about stuff.

284
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,340
And a side effect of it getting better is that the old gatekeepers can no longer gatekeep,

285
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,420
which is why they are losing their minds.

286
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:11,060
So when Joe Rogan endorses Bernie Sanders, regardless of how you feel about Bernie Sanders

287
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,260
politics, it's generally a good thing because it's not a political move.

288
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,820
It is the truth as Joe Rogan sees it.

289
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,620
And if there's one thing that the establishment absolutely cannot tolerate, it's the truth.
