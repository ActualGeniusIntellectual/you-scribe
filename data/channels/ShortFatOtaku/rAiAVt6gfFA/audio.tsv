0	2720	Joe Rogan says he's voting for Bernie.
2720	5800	Who are you going to vote for in the primary?
5800	10040	I think I'll probably vote for Bernie.
10040	13980	Him as a human being, when I was hanging out with him, I believe in him.
13980	14980	I like him.
14980	15980	I like him a lot.
15980	20520	What Bernie stands for is a guy who, well look, you could dig up dirt on every single
20520	24800	human being that's ever existed if you catch them in their worst moment and you magnify
24800	29980	those moments and you cut out everything else and you only display those worst moments.
29980	34100	That said, you can't find very many with Bernie.
34100	37480	He's been insanely consistent his entire life.
37480	43100	He's basically been saying the same thing, been for the same thing his whole life.
43100	49060	And that in and of itself is a very powerful structure to operate from.
49060	55220	Hey, Nathan Bernhard, haven't you been saying that Joe Rogan is far right or alt-right or
55220	57420	whatever for a long time now?
57420	62260	For five days straight, Joe Rogan's sympathetic interview with far-right propagandist Ben
62260	65900	Shapiro has been the most listened to podcast in the world.
65900	67900	Rogan is a far-right apologist.
67900	73000	Aside from Joe Rogan expressing mild skepticism over Andy Noe's brain hemorrhage, the interview
73000	77900	was them ranting about how Antifa are the real fascists, not Nazis.
77900	82340	Joe unfortunately agrees with these far-right grifters on most issues.
82340	87460	Joe Rogan appeared on Infowars yesterday to claim he's not a gateway to the far right.
87460	93300	Previously, Rogan platformed race scientist Stefan Molyneux, Islamophobic fearmonger Ben
93300	96900	Shapiro, and cult leader Jordan Peterson.
96900	100820	Joe has sadly become a springboard for far-right influencers.
100820	104900	Joe Rogan hosted far-right fearmonger Ben Shapiro on his podcast yesterday.
104900	109660	Ben constantly whined about being labeled alt-right and Joe never pushed back.
109660	111780	Last week, Rogan appeared on Infowars.
111780	118020	It's a shame Joe bends over backwards to normalize these far-right maniacs.
118020	124500	It just keeps going, guys, it just keeps going, like, holy shit, hey, hey, Nathan, how the
124500	132580	fuck can you rationalize Joe Rogan, the far-right alt-right whatever, voting for Bernie Sanders?
132580	134740	Maybe it's that you're an idiot.
134740	139220	However, as you probably saw at the start of the video, Joe Rogan's endorsement was
139220	144020	repackaged into an official campaign ad by the Bernie Sanders campaign.
144020	146980	And people are not happy about it.
146980	152100	Joe Rogan is a gateway to the alt-right, which is why this move will be damaging to Bernie.
152740	156820	Now Bernie's movement will suffer an influx of Nazis who want healthcare,
158500	163860	those Nazis and their healthcare, making its spaces unsafe for marginalized members.
163860	168420	Rogan knows exactly what he's doing, kneecapping incipient socialism.
168420	176100	It's more that what you call Nazis, one, aren't actually Nazis, but two, are voters,
176660	182740	voters whom you will need the vote of if you actually want to win in 2020, you moron.
182740	186900	If Bernie doesn't renounce Rogan's endorsement, he'll no longer be my number two.
186900	188740	He won't even be in my top five.
188740	192820	Signal boosting the endorsement of a man who is openly transphobic, misogynist,
192820	195140	and a Nazi apologist is unacceptable.
195140	196980	This is the hill I will die on.
196980	198420	Yeah, it is the hill you will die on.
198420	200980	With the attitude you have regarding politics,
200980	203860	none of the people you support will ever get into office.
203860	209220	However, more importantly, Joe Rogan isn't transphobic, or a misogynist, or a Nazi apologist.
209220	213220	He is willing to discuss things openly rather than simply accept
213220	216500	your side's propaganda on the face of it, which is why you don't like him.
216500	221220	If you guys came out and said being trans means accepting position A, B, C, and D,
221780	225780	and someone decided not to outright reject those positions, but simply
225780	229140	debate their merits, you would call that transphobia.
229140	233300	And I don't mean an obvious position like trans people should be allowed to be alive,
233300	234100	or something like that.
234100	236340	I mean something that actually has a discussion in it.
236340	240660	Like, should trans people be allowed to compete in professional sports,
240660	245220	specifically competing against people who were born that gender rather than transitioned?
246340	248980	There's a legitimate conversation to be had there,
248980	252740	but you think having the conversation means that you're transphobic,
252740	254980	which is again, why you are wrong.
255700	258740	Here's Peter, I married a blow-up doll coffin.
258740	262260	Legitimizing Joe Rogan is not something that has been done by leftists on Twitter
262260	263460	in the last 48 hours.
263460	264740	It happened years ago.
264740	266580	He has 11 million listeners.
266580	267940	That ship has sailed.
267940	270660	It's time to try to persuade those people of something.
270660	272980	You know, on the one hand, I do love the idea
272980	276500	that we could lay all of this at the feet of Fear Factor, or something.
276500	278340	On the other, though, Peter Coffin's actually right.
279060	281060	Joe Rogan has 11 million listeners.
281060	285620	If you want to get them on side, you have to treat them seriously,
285620	289140	and not just simply call them racists or whatever.
289140	294260	Bernie Sanders must reconsider Joe Rogan's endorsement, says LGBTQ group.
294980	299940	Human Rights Campaign says podcast host Rogan has attacked countless marginalized groups
299940	301460	at every opportunity.
301460	304900	And of course, put in the least flattering picture of Bernie you can get.
304980	305620	Yeah, no.
306420	311060	A purity spiral is the opposite of what you want to have when you're trying to win an election.
311060	316420	You have to have a broad tent that covers a lot of people with a lot of different views.
316420	317540	That's how you win.
317540	320820	And in fact, that is exactly what Bernie's campaign said, to their credit.
321380	325220	The goal of our campaign is to build a multiracial, multigenerational movement
325220	328580	that is large enough to defeat Donald Trump and the powerful special interest
328580	332260	whose greed and corruption is the root cause of the outrageous inequality in America.
332260	337300	Sharing a big tent requires including those who do not share every one of our beliefs,
337300	340340	while always making clear that we will never compromise our values.
340340	342980	The truth is that by standing together in solidarity,
342980	345140	we share the values of love and respect
345140	348260	that will move us in the direction of a more humane, more equal world.
348260	351620	Now you can object to a lot of the rhetoric used in that passage.
351620	353300	There's certainly some problems with it.
353300	357700	But the point is, we will not reject Joe Rogan's endorsement,
357700	361060	simply because a far left vocal fringe doesn't like it.
361060	363620	And that is the right thing to do in this situation.
363620	365940	This is a pathetic response and I'm done.
365940	370580	It is clear the Bernie Sanders campaign does not care about holding transphobia accountable.
370580	374660	Among the many other awful things Joe Rogan has perpetuated on his program,
374660	376500	I am a human being and a trans person.
376500	377940	I am not another belief.
377940	380900	The problem, and this is I think a problem with a lot of trans activists,
380900	384340	is that they equate their humanity with their activism.
384340	387620	So for example, if you reject some of their political opinions,
387620	392340	they take it as if it is a dangerous direct assault on their very life.
392340	395700	It's not, obviously, but that's how they get away with rhetoric like this.
395700	399380	Oh, and also, you work for the Hillary Clinton campaign.
399380	402020	You're just fucking angry that you lost in 2016
402020	405380	because Hillary decided to fight against the activist wing of her own party.
405380	407380	Feel free to stay mad about it.
407380	412180	But there are idiots out there who actually think this is about gender somehow.
412180	413860	Hillary must be quiet.
413860	415700	Joe Rogan must be boosted.
415700	418420	It's like a seminar on the role of gender in US politics.
418420	421540	Well, firstly, Hillary's not even in the fucking campaign.
421540	425300	And that might be a good thing for Democrats, because if she entered, she'd lose again.
425300	427780	But secondly, it's not about their gender at all.
427780	429620	In fact, it's the opposite of that.
429620	434180	Joe Rogan is considered evil because he's a man who has made some problematic jokes,
434180	436740	and maybe he smoked weed with Elon Musk on air,
436740	441220	and maybe he's debated distasteful ideas rather than simply running away from them scared.
441220	444180	Hillary, the literal fucking neoliberal warmonger,
444180	448660	who went on a radio show where they used to quiz mentally disabled people back in the 90s
448660	451860	on how to spell simple words they didn't understand.
451860	454500	She's good because she is a woman.
454500	457060	This is why identity politics will always lead you to ruin,
457060	459780	in politics, in business, in science.
459780	460660	Doesn't matter.
460660	466340	Only 53% of Bernie Sanders voters will definitely support the 2020 Democratic nomination.
467780	468340	Infinite.
468340	469060	Yikes.
469060	469940	No, no, no, no, no.
469940	471860	This is not the time to moralize.
472340	475300	This is not the time to browbeat people into going your way
475300	478180	because you can't shame somebody into voting for your candidate.
478180	482180	This is the time to reconcile and make deals with people, all right?
482180	484100	You will lose with this attitude.
484100	487060	If your response to the people who say Bernie or Bust
487060	492180	is to call them racists or sexist or bigots or whatever, you will lose them.
492180	494260	If your response is to cut a deal with them,
494260	496660	maybe include some of their policies on your platform,
496660	500820	and maybe make Bernie like the Secretary of State or something, you could figure it out,
500820	502900	then maybe you get more of them on board.
502900	505300	But this, this is how you lose.
505300	509220	Joe Rogan back in 2012, call me romantic,
509220	513540	but I love when gay guys on a date are comfortable enough to kiss in public.
513540	518180	In the Democratic Party, we do not fetishize LGBTQ plus folks.
518180	522340	When they show affection in a public place, it is not for your pleasure.
522340	526340	Bernie Sanders, delete this tweet and renounce Joe Rogan's endorsement.
526340	532820	Can you, can you imagine like Joe Rogan just furiously masturbating
532820	535620	over like a gay public displays of affection fetish?
537140	542740	This is, this is the most reaching I have ever seen anyone do in quite some time.
542740	544500	Here's something to think about though.
544500	548980	If Joe Rogan actually is this, this, this gateway to the alt-right,
548980	551620	if he, you know, he platforms the far right and therefore
551620	553780	legitimizes them and all this other bullshit,
553780	559700	then what does it say about him when he has Bernie Sanders on his, his podcast for an hour?
559700	563940	And what does it say about him when he endorses Bernie Sanders after that podcast?
563940	567460	Does that make him a, a gateway towards Bernie?
567460	570580	Does that mean that he is a pipeline to, to the alt-left?
570580	572020	In fact, people are saying the opposite.
572020	576180	People are saying that they don't want Joe Rogan's audience to enter the far left.
576180	579860	They don't want Joe Rogan's audience to, to be a part of Bernie's campaign.
579860	582660	So if you don't want people radicalized towards the right,
582660	585220	and you don't want people radicalized towards the left,
585220	587700	and we already know that you have no love for the centrists,
588420	592740	what do you want to do with all of those people that don't politically agree with you?
592740	596020	If you don't want to convert them, if you don't want to leave them alone,
596020	599140	and if you don't want them to, to radicalize to be your enemy,
599140	600660	what do you want to do with them?
600660	601140	I don't know.
601940	604820	Maybe everyone in the far left is actually a legit tanky
604820	607700	that just wants to put all of them in gulags or something.
607700	610900	Maybe they actually want to see their, their political opposition dead.
610900	614100	Like, I don't know, possibly like what else is left?
614100	616900	Let's say Joe Rogan's audience is actually alt-right.
617540	622260	And let's say some of those alt-right people have been convinced by Joe Rogan's podcast
622260	626820	and endorsement of Bernie to maybe swing a bit more left in their politics
626820	629220	and, and, and vote for Bernie this time around.
629220	630500	Is that not a victory?
630500	635140	How could you justify screaming that your marginalized communities are now unsafe
635140	639300	as more people who used to be alt-right join your marginalized communities
639300	641060	because they now agree with your politics?
641060	644020	Is it because you believe that there's something innate in those people
644020	646900	that just makes them incompatible with, with your movement?
646900	650820	Or, I mean, maybe you just want to have an eternal enemy that you can always fight.
650820	653140	Maybe instead of actually growing your political movement,
653140	656100	maybe instead of actually growing the left as a whole,
656100	658180	you just want your exclusive club.
658180	661860	Have you guys even realized that if Bernie were to get everything he wanted,
662420	666580	all of those gamergate dude bros that you hate would also get universal healthcare,
666580	669460	because that's the point of universal healthcare.
669460	672740	And just in case you had any doubts that this is at least partially about Hillary,
672740	679540	here is HRC president Alfonso David basically calling for Joe Rogan to, to be cancel cultured.
679540	680580	I mean, good luck with that.
680580	684020	His, his YouTube channel is certainly larger than anything
684660	686420	that the mainstream media puts out anymore.
686420	688340	And really, I think that's what this is all about.
688340	691860	It doesn't matter whether or not you agree with Bernie Sanders' platform.
691860	696020	What matters is that he's getting the endorsement not of news organizations,
696020	697300	but of content creators.
697300	700020	He's strangely enough streaming on Twitch.
700020	701460	He's talking to Joe Rogan.
701460	702980	He's going on other podcasts.
702980	708340	And he's, he's actually engaging with, with these alternative methods of communication.
708340	711620	And the media doesn't like that he's sidestepping them for new tech.
711620	717380	The honest truth is YouTubers are kingmakers in a way that the media used to be 30 years ago.
717380	718420	And now they're not.
718420	720340	Nobody cares about what CNN has to say anymore.
720340	721700	CNN is a dying brand.
721700	725220	And at this point, we've kind of moved away from Joe Rogan and Bernie Sanders.
725220	728900	And that's because the truth of the matter is around 30 years ago,
728900	732740	the news media held dominion over whatever information that you,
732740	736820	that you received regarding any affair that was happening like outside of your town.
736820	742020	You basically had to watch their 15-second sound bites and listen to their very meaningless
742020	744740	interviews giving a very basic overview of the situation.
745380	748180	But nowadays, people are going to Joe Rogan instead.
748180	749700	They're going to other podcasters.
749700	752340	They're listening to things either, either like on their phones.
752340	754980	It's like a podcast, or they're listening to the YouTube video.
755780	757140	They don't even watch Joe Rogan.
757140	761620	They just put them on in the background, and they listen while they're doing the dishes,
761620	764660	or they're working out, or they're playing video games, or something.
764660	768660	They're basically listening to these two-hour, these three-hour conversations,
768660	774900	where they actually take a deep dive into a topic with a guest.
774900	779700	And not just give a 15-second sound bite, but really discuss something in depth.
779700	782900	And because of the internet, people are becoming educated in ways that
782900	785060	were never possible 20, 30 years ago.
785060	787540	And it's not just Joe Rogan, and it's not just podcasting.
787540	790660	For example, academia is shifting away from the university as well.
791380	796900	There's no reason to pay thousands of dollars to attend one of Jordan Peterson's classes
796900	800420	over the course of a semester when you can just go and watch all the lectures on YouTube.
800420	801300	They're all there.
801300	803540	You'll get 90% of the same content.
803540	809860	So things like news and politics and academics have all been, for most of human history,
809860	812900	within a very tight, confined structure.
812900	815540	And the internet has basically set them free.
815540	819780	And so people are now accessing crazy amounts of information, and crazy amounts of knowledge,
819780	822740	and getting educated in ways that have never been possible before.
823380	827460	And the people who used to be the old gatekeepers of those things, they don't like it.
827460	829460	Now there's obviously the problem of accreditation.
830180	835860	What happens if you decide to take all of your classes online and just watch the lectures on
835860	836660	YouTube?
836660	840500	Like, how does somebody know that you actually learned all that stuff?
840500	845060	That's why you have to get a degree or a diploma, because those things are basically proof that
845060	846740	you learned what you say you learned.
846740	849540	And currently, that doesn't exist online, so who knows?
849540	853620	Even in terms of news, how do you know that the YouTubers you watch are factually accurate?
853620	858740	You know, I tend to watch Sargon and Styx and Chew on Head, or even people I disagree with,
858740	859700	like ContraPoints.
859700	862900	I regularly watch people that I disagree with so that I'm not stuck in an echo chamber.
862900	866580	I can actually synthesize the truth out of all of these various different sources.
866580	868180	But not everyone has time for that.
868180	869860	Not everyone has the inclination for that.
869860	874260	Some people just really want to be in an echo chamber where they're only told things that
874260	875300	they actually agree with.
875300	877380	How do you solve those problems online?
877380	878340	I'm not sure.
878340	882180	But the old solution was simply the authority of the source.
882180	887300	So when CNN said, you can trust us, we're giving you the news, you know, 30 years ago,
887300	889300	that did fly for better or worse.
889300	893940	And the reason it doesn't now is because journalists have proven themselves to no longer
893940	895940	be worthy of the public's trust.
895940	900020	And so that trust is now shifting away from them to content creators.
900020	905300	So the news establishment is losing its mind that some kid with a webcam has just as much
905300	906260	reach as they do.
906260	910900	And meanwhile, larger sources like Sargon or Styx, they have significantly more reach
910900	912900	than CNN or MSNBC.
912900	914660	With, by the way, a lot less overhead.
914660	919220	This also explains why the news establishment is being in lockstep with the political establishment.
920020	924740	It no longer matters if Bernie Sanders gets 30 seconds on CNN and manages to pull some
924740	927780	kind of corporate endorsement or some kind of news endorsement or whatever.
927780	931460	You can hop on Joe Rogan for an hour, talk about his platform in depth and then get an
931460	932580	endorsement because of it.
932580	933460	And here's the thing.
933460	938500	I'm reasonably certain that Joe Rogan's endorsement wasn't paid for by Bernie Sanders.
938500	940580	That makes it his actual opinion.
940580	946260	And if it's his actual opinion, it has a lot more weight than some kind of backroom deal.
946340	950980	Basically, even though there's problems with authenticity and accreditation and what the
950980	955300	news media rightfully does sometimes call fake news, despite all of those problems,
955300	959460	things are generally getting better for your average person who wants to learn about stuff.
959460	964340	And a side effect of it getting better is that the old gatekeepers can no longer gatekeep,
964340	966420	which is why they are losing their minds.
966420	971060	So when Joe Rogan endorses Bernie Sanders, regardless of how you feel about Bernie Sanders
971060	974260	politics, it's generally a good thing because it's not a political move.
974260	976820	It is the truth as Joe Rogan sees it.
976820	981620	And if there's one thing that the establishment absolutely cannot tolerate, it's the truth.
