0	4140	Hey guys, Dev here. I'm finally doing that Update Vlog I've been talking about on the
4140	7660	stream so much recently. I'm actually doing this just before I work out. I seem to wear
7660	12220	the same workout clothes every time I do a Vlog because I'm always doing it before or
12220	16420	after a workout. There are four topics that I want to cover in this Update Vlog, and those
16420	22420	are the main SFO channel, that's this channel, the NTG channel, that's our No Talent Gaming
22420	28340	Let's Play stuff, our other projects, and our new social media accounts which we're
28340	32460	starting out. Regarding SFO, Sharp at Otaku, this channel, the one that you're currently
32460	36980	watching this Vlog on, I know that we initially started as an anime review channel, but it's
36980	42140	become very obvious to you and to us that everyone's here for politics stuff. A lot
42140	47260	of you guys found us during Gamergate, and a lot of you guys stick around for political
47260	54260	videos. The political videos that we put up get, you know, 1000 or 2000 or 4000 views
55100	59740	in the first, say, week, and the other stuff that we do doesn't get near that. So there's
59740	63780	about 5000 people subscribed to this channel right now, and it's pretty obvious to me at
63780	68380	least that about 4 fifths of you are here for that type of content. And now that I'm
68380	73500	doing political videos regularly again, I'm going to make this channel, the main SFO channel,
73500	78960	the home for that project. I'm going to aim for one new video of this type a week. I'm
78960	82980	not sure if I'll hit it because, you know, real life sometimes gets in the way, but that
82980	87460	is the goal. Next week, I'm hoping around Monday or Tuesday I'm going to put out a video
87460	93660	on pedophilia. Right now, everyone seems to be talking about pedophilia and politics.
93660	100660	I wrote a script about pedophilia about 6 months ago that I just didn't put out. I just
101420	105020	got lazy basically and the script is still just sitting on my hard drive. There's still
105020	108860	a lot of good research and work that went into that script, so I'm going to retool it
108860	113380	and update it and make that next week's video. After that, I'm considering doing a video
113380	119000	on Justin Trudeau because I'm a Canadian, I know a lot of the domestic policies that
119000	125620	he's implemented, and I know that he's kind of a joke among, you know, the, I guess you
125620	131740	can call it the skeptic circle on YouTube, like for some of his ridiculousness, but he's
131740	136280	done some stuff here at home in Canada that is equally ridiculous that has not really
136520	141560	made the rounds outside of Canada. So I'm going to do a video on Trudeau. I think that
141560	145740	will be the one after the pedo video. So obviously you're here watching this on this channel
145740	149720	so you probably know this, but just in case you don't for some reason, the channel that
149720	155560	this all happens on is youtube.com slash short fat otaku. And if you're interested in supporting
155560	161760	me in doing this, the Patreon for that channel is patreon.com slash short fat otaku. And
161760	166000	I also have some news about that Patreon as well. For a long time we've used the short
166720	170600	fat otaku Patreon as a way to fund all of our projects and come March 1st we're going
170600	177280	to be stopping that. On March 1st the SFO Patreon will be used only to fund the political
177280	182840	videos and to reflect that change, rather than it being a monthly Patreon, it's going
182840	188080	to become a per article Patreon. And the rules that I'm setting for that will be that every
188080	193420	time a political video comes out on this channel that is at least 20 minutes in length, it's
193420	197940	going to cycle a payment on Patreon. So if you like the political videos that come out
197940	202660	around here and you feel like financially supporting the channel patreon.com slash short
202660	207740	fat otaku would be the place to go. Another thing that I'm going to do on March 1st is
207740	212940	remove the backlog of our let's play series No Talent Gaming that is currently on the
212940	217620	short fat otaku channel. For a long time we used the SFO channel as a place to upload
217620	221100	our let's plays and there's like a thousand let's play videos on there. And what I've
221100	225880	realized is that when new people show up to watch our political videos and then they
225880	230020	sub for those political videos, even though we haven't uploaded a let's play to this channel
230020	236080	in over a year, their inbox and their suggested videos box gets bombarded with all of our
236080	240020	old let's play videos, even though they're old because there's just so many of them.
240020	244200	So on March 1st I'm removing them from this channel. Now they're not going to be gone,
244200	249220	if you are somebody who actually likes or liked our let's play series, they're not gone.
249220	253980	They have been re-uploaded on the NTG YouTube channel for about a year now. Their backups
253980	257860	are there and if you're interested in like going over there and seeing them you can do
257860	261540	so if you want to like repost your comments or rewatch the old let's plays for whatever
261540	265220	reason or you're just somebody who's new and wants to see what we're doing over there,
265220	271700	I'll talk about that in a minute. But on the SFO channel I am removing those videos primarily
271700	276460	because we want this to be a politically focused channel going forward and having those videos
276460	281520	around kind of interfered with that. NTG or No Talent Gaming is what we call our let's
281520	285420	play series and for a while like I said we had that hosted on the SFO channel but for
285420	292820	about a year now, since January 2016, it's been over at youtube.com slash c slash no
292820	296440	talent gaming and about six months ago we started streaming our let's play sessions
296440	304100	live on the NTG YouTube channel itself but also at twitch.tv slash short fat otaku, hitbox
304100	310260	tv slash short fat otaku and also over on beam at short fat otaku as well. And generally
310260	314620	how it works is that we'll stream a session of the let's play and we'll interact with
314620	319320	the chat, generally only the twitch chat even though we stream to four sources because the
319320	324340	program that we use to do so, restream, they don't have a unified chat application for
324340	328180	Macs and we do use a Mac to stream. So generally if you're tuning in and you want to talk to
328180	332220	us you know twitch is your best bet until they sort that out anyway. But generally we'll
332220	336620	stream a session of a game, it usually lasts between two and four hours and then the next
336620	343900	day that session will be uploaded at the NTG YouTube channel. We generally stream five
343900	348380	days a week, we generally do you know the usual Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
348380	356420	Friday at approximately seven pm. Though sometimes a little bit later. The chat room will attest
356420	361260	it's often a little bit later but we do our best to aim for seven. And if NTG sounds like
361300	366540	something that you want to financially support you can do so over at patreon.com slash no talent
366540	373820	gaming. We decided to split up the patreons for SFO and NTG, one to make it easier on us financially
373820	378300	just to understand where the money is coming from and what people are interested in and two
378300	385700	to make it more accountable and transparent to you guys. However NTG it is in fact a monthly
385700	391660	thing. If you're donating money to the NTG patreon there will be a monthly charge cycle
391660	396540	basically. And the whole point with that is that it's kind of hard to do you know significant
396540	402500	rewards tiers for a live let's play series you know everything that you that you're there to see
402500	408660	is already live you just go to twitch and you see it you know. I can't really release a video early
408660	415300	or whatever because you already see it live. So the NTG patreon is a monthly thing while the SFO
415300	421380	patreon will be a per political video thing. And the NTG patreon will also be set up on March 1st.
421380	426100	And I know that there are some of you out there who are currently donating to the SFO patreon
426100	433380	but primarily watch us for NTG there are at least two people I know who do that for sure. And if you
433380	437980	are one of those people you will want to make a switch on March 1st. Let's talk about some other
437980	445100	projects. For example the SFO channel originally back in like 2008 or 2009 started off as an anime
445140	450900	review channel. And we have largely kind of outgrown that and not completely because I still
450900	455380	like anime and Dave still likes anime. We have at least five scripts written and several of them
455380	460340	already shot just kind of unedited and and the voice work for them hasn't been done yet. So
460340	465100	there's there are still anime reviews coming down the pipes but it's not gonna be like the old days
465100	469500	where it was like one every two weeks because frankly the audience just isn't there for it
469500	477740	anymore. We did like four years of anime reviews and barely scratched the surface in terms of you
477740	482660	know interest on YouTube and then as soon as we started doing politics tons of people started
482660	489900	showing up. So at some point in the future probably at the end of March we're going to be moving our
489900	494940	anime reviews off of the SFO channel and onto its own channel as well. And I'll have more details
494940	499860	about that when the time comes but we really want the SFO channel to be focused on politics
499860	504100	because that is what you guys are here for and the other projects like the let's plays and the
504100	509220	anime reviews aren't dead they're just going somewhere else. At the same time I also started
509220	514020	up a channel called Gentrifying Games that was basically meant to be my game design project
514020	518100	which I'm still very interested in but I'm also going to broaden that channel to include any kind
518100	524700	of video game content that is not a let's play like reviews or like in-depth analysis or maybe
524700	530780	unboxing videos or perhaps best ofs or super cuts of the let's plays just in case some people don't
530780	535700	actually have the time to sit down and watch like 20 parts or 30 parts or 50 parts of a let's play.
535700	539180	And the main reason that I'm keeping all that stuff separate and not just putting all the gaming
539180	545620	stuff on NTG is because on a daily upload channel like no talent gaming stuff gets lost very easily.
545620	551940	You know if you were to spend say 10 hours or 20 hours editing some kind of long-form content and
551980	557300	then you upload it on a daily upload channel it immediately just gets washed away by everything
557300	561820	else that's on that channel you know. In a couple days the daily uploads will just kind of bury it.
561820	567380	So any kind of edited gaming content that is not a let's play will be also up over at the Gentrifying
567380	572660	Games channel and that's going to include game analysis and game design that's going to include
572660	576500	reviews that's going to include basically anything that I feel like will fit there.
576500	581540	And that's basically just going to leave the SFO channel for politics because most of the
581540	587220	viewers here are here for politics. I will occasionally like cross-promote them and link
587220	591780	back to them and say like hey if you're if you're a new viewer here come check out the let's plays
591780	595580	or something. I'm gonna do stuff like that once in a while but for the most part the videos that come
595580	600500	out here will be political stuff it'll be like gamergate stuff even though gamergate is not
600500	605380	really relevant anymore there are still some things to be talked about in that sphere so I'll
605380	611020	make a few videos on them and just sort of related culture warring type of stuff. And with all that
611020	615580	being said I also have some new social media stuff to bring up. It's a surprise to nobody that
615580	619540	both Twitter and Facebook are kind of going tits up at the moment so I've been looking into
619540	624180	alternative social media platforms just to see if anything's really interesting out there. I did
624180	630540	sign up for a Mines account at mines.com slash Shripetotaku but that's going to primarily be
630540	635980	used to talk about politics and promote the political and gamergate and other type of that
635980	640820	stuff. That platform is really built for that sort of discussion and the primary focus of that
640820	645740	account will be to build up that project. I also made an account over at Gab which I think is
645740	650460	positioning itself as an alternative to Twitter. Considering how draconian Twitter's getting with
650460	656740	like censoring people's tweets and banning people and like throttling them and stuff I'm going to
656740	663180	give Gab a serious try. And finally I'm also looking into vid.me. The main reason for that
663180	668580	is because YouTube even though it's it's not really going down the censorship route it has
668580	673900	always been kind of this this monolith this unreachable monolith with especially after it
673900	677900	got bought out by Google or if you had like a problem with your videos or like someone did
677900	683940	like an obvious an obvious false copyright claim or something on your videos and you had to like
683940	687420	message them and be like listen guys this is obviously something that's wrong. They would
687420	693060	never ever talk to you. YouTube is notoriously bad for just kind of letting the chips fall where
693060	696820	they may in terms of their content creators. And I really don't want to put all my eggs in one
696860	702300	basket in that regard. For a long time back in the day for example blip TV was one of the big
702300	708260	alternatives to YouTube and I was very big on blip back then. Believe it or not you know I got I
708260	715580	think it by the by the time blip finally shut down we were nearly at a million views. My most
715580	724620	popular video had over 200,000 views on blip and really from like 2008 to 2011 or so blip TV was
724620	729340	the place to be over YouTube and then you know maker studios bought them and then completely
729340	734860	drove the thing into the ground and that was the end of it. But now vid.me is around and they seem
734860	739820	to be very very promising as a great YouTube alternative and you will see at the beginning
739820	745540	at least all of the SFO political content mirrored over there and of course if the platform takes off
745540	750340	I'm probably gonna put some projects over there exclusively but for now this is a test run. I'm
750340	755900	gonna mirror up the SFO stuff the political stuff over there and we're gonna see how it goes. I am
755900	760780	aiming for the vid.me channel to be up around March 1st as well but it might be just a few
760780	764940	days later too and of course we still are on Twitter you can go to twitter.com slash short
764940	772820	flight otaku and facebook.com slash sf otaku and see us there and we'll be there basically until
772820	776900	either the service shuts down or they decide to ban us and considering how the services are going
776900	781380	right now I have no clue if and when that will ever happen but if it does we are looking into
781380	787460	these alternatives. So yeah that's pretty much it guys. If you're here for politics please please
787460	792780	stick around for next week's pedo video. If you like no talent gaming or if you are interested
792780	797860	in checking out no talent gaming Naomi and I will be streaming Chrono Trigger tonight over at twitch.tv
797860	803580	slash short flight otaku and any of the past let's plays and streams that we've done before are all
803620	809180	up over at youtube.com slash C slash no talent game if you're interested in supporting financially
809180	815140	any of these projects that would be at patreon.com slash short flight otaku and patreon.com slash no
815140	818820	talent gaming and regardless of which of these projects you're actually interested in I will be
818820	823580	very happy to see you there. Alright guys that's it for me I'm out I love you.
