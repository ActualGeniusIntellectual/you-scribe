{"text": " Hey guys, Dev here. I'm finally doing that Update Vlog I've been talking about on the stream so much recently. I'm actually doing this just before I work out. I seem to wear the same workout clothes every time I do a Vlog because I'm always doing it before or after a workout. There are four topics that I want to cover in this Update Vlog, and those are the main SFO channel, that's this channel, the NTG channel, that's our No Talent Gaming Let's Play stuff, our other projects, and our new social media accounts which we're starting out. Regarding SFO, Sharp at Otaku, this channel, the one that you're currently watching this Vlog on, I know that we initially started as an anime review channel, but it's become very obvious to you and to us that everyone's here for politics stuff. A lot of you guys found us during Gamergate, and a lot of you guys stick around for political videos. The political videos that we put up get, you know, 1000 or 2000 or 4000 views in the first, say, week, and the other stuff that we do doesn't get near that. So there's about 5000 people subscribed to this channel right now, and it's pretty obvious to me at least that about 4 fifths of you are here for that type of content. And now that I'm doing political videos regularly again, I'm going to make this channel, the main SFO channel, the home for that project. I'm going to aim for one new video of this type a week. I'm not sure if I'll hit it because, you know, real life sometimes gets in the way, but that is the goal. Next week, I'm hoping around Monday or Tuesday I'm going to put out a video on pedophilia. Right now, everyone seems to be talking about pedophilia and politics. I wrote a script about pedophilia about 6 months ago that I just didn't put out. I just got lazy basically and the script is still just sitting on my hard drive. There's still a lot of good research and work that went into that script, so I'm going to retool it and update it and make that next week's video. After that, I'm considering doing a video on Justin Trudeau because I'm a Canadian, I know a lot of the domestic policies that he's implemented, and I know that he's kind of a joke among, you know, the, I guess you can call it the skeptic circle on YouTube, like for some of his ridiculousness, but he's done some stuff here at home in Canada that is equally ridiculous that has not really made the rounds outside of Canada. So I'm going to do a video on Trudeau. I think that will be the one after the pedo video. So obviously you're here watching this on this channel so you probably know this, but just in case you don't for some reason, the channel that this all happens on is youtube.com slash short fat otaku. And if you're interested in supporting me in doing this, the Patreon for that channel is patreon.com slash short fat otaku. And I also have some news about that Patreon as well. For a long time we've used the short fat otaku Patreon as a way to fund all of our projects and come March 1st we're going to be stopping that. On March 1st the SFO Patreon will be used only to fund the political videos and to reflect that change, rather than it being a monthly Patreon, it's going to become a per article Patreon. And the rules that I'm setting for that will be that every time a political video comes out on this channel that is at least 20 minutes in length, it's going to cycle a payment on Patreon. So if you like the political videos that come out around here and you feel like financially supporting the channel patreon.com slash short fat otaku would be the place to go. Another thing that I'm going to do on March 1st is remove the backlog of our let's play series No Talent Gaming that is currently on the short fat otaku channel. For a long time we used the SFO channel as a place to upload our let's plays and there's like a thousand let's play videos on there. And what I've realized is that when new people show up to watch our political videos and then they sub for those political videos, even though we haven't uploaded a let's play to this channel in over a year, their inbox and their suggested videos box gets bombarded with all of our old let's play videos, even though they're old because there's just so many of them. So on March 1st I'm removing them from this channel. Now they're not going to be gone, if you are somebody who actually likes or liked our let's play series, they're not gone. They have been re-uploaded on the NTG YouTube channel for about a year now. Their backups are there and if you're interested in like going over there and seeing them you can do so if you want to like repost your comments or rewatch the old let's plays for whatever reason or you're just somebody who's new and wants to see what we're doing over there, I'll talk about that in a minute. But on the SFO channel I am removing those videos primarily because we want this to be a politically focused channel going forward and having those videos around kind of interfered with that. NTG or No Talent Gaming is what we call our let's play series and for a while like I said we had that hosted on the SFO channel but for about a year now, since January 2016, it's been over at youtube.com slash c slash no talent gaming and about six months ago we started streaming our let's play sessions live on the NTG YouTube channel itself but also at twitch.tv slash short fat otaku, hitbox tv slash short fat otaku and also over on beam at short fat otaku as well. And generally how it works is that we'll stream a session of the let's play and we'll interact with the chat, generally only the twitch chat even though we stream to four sources because the program that we use to do so, restream, they don't have a unified chat application for Macs and we do use a Mac to stream. So generally if you're tuning in and you want to talk to us you know twitch is your best bet until they sort that out anyway. But generally we'll stream a session of a game, it usually lasts between two and four hours and then the next day that session will be uploaded at the NTG YouTube channel. We generally stream five days a week, we generally do you know the usual Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday at approximately seven pm. Though sometimes a little bit later. The chat room will attest it's often a little bit later but we do our best to aim for seven. And if NTG sounds like something that you want to financially support you can do so over at patreon.com slash no talent gaming. We decided to split up the patreons for SFO and NTG, one to make it easier on us financially just to understand where the money is coming from and what people are interested in and two to make it more accountable and transparent to you guys. However NTG it is in fact a monthly thing. If you're donating money to the NTG patreon there will be a monthly charge cycle basically. And the whole point with that is that it's kind of hard to do you know significant rewards tiers for a live let's play series you know everything that you that you're there to see is already live you just go to twitch and you see it you know. I can't really release a video early or whatever because you already see it live. So the NTG patreon is a monthly thing while the SFO patreon will be a per political video thing. And the NTG patreon will also be set up on March 1st. And I know that there are some of you out there who are currently donating to the SFO patreon but primarily watch us for NTG there are at least two people I know who do that for sure. And if you are one of those people you will want to make a switch on March 1st. Let's talk about some other projects. For example the SFO channel originally back in like 2008 or 2009 started off as an anime review channel. And we have largely kind of outgrown that and not completely because I still like anime and Dave still likes anime. We have at least five scripts written and several of them already shot just kind of unedited and and the voice work for them hasn't been done yet. So there's there are still anime reviews coming down the pipes but it's not gonna be like the old days where it was like one every two weeks because frankly the audience just isn't there for it anymore. We did like four years of anime reviews and barely scratched the surface in terms of you know interest on YouTube and then as soon as we started doing politics tons of people started showing up. So at some point in the future probably at the end of March we're going to be moving our anime reviews off of the SFO channel and onto its own channel as well. And I'll have more details about that when the time comes but we really want the SFO channel to be focused on politics because that is what you guys are here for and the other projects like the let's plays and the anime reviews aren't dead they're just going somewhere else. At the same time I also started up a channel called Gentrifying Games that was basically meant to be my game design project which I'm still very interested in but I'm also going to broaden that channel to include any kind of video game content that is not a let's play like reviews or like in-depth analysis or maybe unboxing videos or perhaps best ofs or super cuts of the let's plays just in case some people don't actually have the time to sit down and watch like 20 parts or 30 parts or 50 parts of a let's play. And the main reason that I'm keeping all that stuff separate and not just putting all the gaming stuff on NTG is because on a daily upload channel like no talent gaming stuff gets lost very easily. You know if you were to spend say 10 hours or 20 hours editing some kind of long-form content and then you upload it on a daily upload channel it immediately just gets washed away by everything else that's on that channel you know. In a couple days the daily uploads will just kind of bury it. So any kind of edited gaming content that is not a let's play will be also up over at the Gentrifying Games channel and that's going to include game analysis and game design that's going to include reviews that's going to include basically anything that I feel like will fit there. And that's basically just going to leave the SFO channel for politics because most of the viewers here are here for politics. I will occasionally like cross-promote them and link back to them and say like hey if you're if you're a new viewer here come check out the let's plays or something. I'm gonna do stuff like that once in a while but for the most part the videos that come out here will be political stuff it'll be like gamergate stuff even though gamergate is not really relevant anymore there are still some things to be talked about in that sphere so I'll make a few videos on them and just sort of related culture warring type of stuff. And with all that being said I also have some new social media stuff to bring up. It's a surprise to nobody that both Twitter and Facebook are kind of going tits up at the moment so I've been looking into alternative social media platforms just to see if anything's really interesting out there. I did sign up for a Mines account at mines.com slash Shripetotaku but that's going to primarily be used to talk about politics and promote the political and gamergate and other type of that stuff. That platform is really built for that sort of discussion and the primary focus of that account will be to build up that project. I also made an account over at Gab which I think is positioning itself as an alternative to Twitter. Considering how draconian Twitter's getting with like censoring people's tweets and banning people and like throttling them and stuff I'm going to give Gab a serious try. And finally I'm also looking into vid.me. The main reason for that is because YouTube even though it's it's not really going down the censorship route it has always been kind of this this monolith this unreachable monolith with especially after it got bought out by Google or if you had like a problem with your videos or like someone did like an obvious an obvious false copyright claim or something on your videos and you had to like message them and be like listen guys this is obviously something that's wrong. They would never ever talk to you. YouTube is notoriously bad for just kind of letting the chips fall where they may in terms of their content creators. And I really don't want to put all my eggs in one basket in that regard. For a long time back in the day for example blip TV was one of the big alternatives to YouTube and I was very big on blip back then. Believe it or not you know I got I think it by the by the time blip finally shut down we were nearly at a million views. My most popular video had over 200,000 views on blip and really from like 2008 to 2011 or so blip TV was the place to be over YouTube and then you know maker studios bought them and then completely drove the thing into the ground and that was the end of it. But now vid.me is around and they seem to be very very promising as a great YouTube alternative and you will see at the beginning at least all of the SFO political content mirrored over there and of course if the platform takes off I'm probably gonna put some projects over there exclusively but for now this is a test run. I'm gonna mirror up the SFO stuff the political stuff over there and we're gonna see how it goes. I am aiming for the vid.me channel to be up around March 1st as well but it might be just a few days later too and of course we still are on Twitter you can go to twitter.com slash short flight otaku and facebook.com slash sf otaku and see us there and we'll be there basically until either the service shuts down or they decide to ban us and considering how the services are going right now I have no clue if and when that will ever happen but if it does we are looking into these alternatives. So yeah that's pretty much it guys. If you're here for politics please please stick around for next week's pedo video. If you like no talent gaming or if you are interested in checking out no talent gaming Naomi and I will be streaming Chrono Trigger tonight over at twitch.tv slash short flight otaku and any of the past let's plays and streams that we've done before are all up over at youtube.com slash C slash no talent game if you're interested in supporting financially any of these projects that would be at patreon.com slash short flight otaku and patreon.com slash no talent gaming and regardless of which of these projects you're actually interested in I will be very happy to see you there. Alright guys that's it for me I'm out I love you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 4.14, "text": " Hey guys, Dev here.
