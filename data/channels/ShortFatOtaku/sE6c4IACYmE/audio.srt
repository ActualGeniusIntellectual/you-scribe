00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
Hey guys, Dev here. I'm finally doing that Update Vlog I've been talking about on the

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,660
stream so much recently. I'm actually doing this just before I work out. I seem to wear

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,220
the same workout clothes every time I do a Vlog because I'm always doing it before or

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,420
after a workout. There are four topics that I want to cover in this Update Vlog, and those

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:22,420
are the main SFO channel, that's this channel, the NTG channel, that's our No Talent Gaming

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:28,340
Let's Play stuff, our other projects, and our new social media accounts which we're

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,460
starting out. Regarding SFO, Sharp at Otaku, this channel, the one that you're currently

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,980
watching this Vlog on, I know that we initially started as an anime review channel, but it's

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,140
become very obvious to you and to us that everyone's here for politics stuff. A lot

10
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,260
of you guys found us during Gamergate, and a lot of you guys stick around for political

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:54,260
videos. The political videos that we put up get, you know, 1000 or 2000 or 4000 views

12
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,740
in the first, say, week, and the other stuff that we do doesn't get near that. So there's

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,780
about 5000 people subscribed to this channel right now, and it's pretty obvious to me at

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,380
least that about 4 fifths of you are here for that type of content. And now that I'm

15
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,500
doing political videos regularly again, I'm going to make this channel, the main SFO channel,

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,960
the home for that project. I'm going to aim for one new video of this type a week. I'm

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,980
not sure if I'll hit it because, you know, real life sometimes gets in the way, but that

18
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,460
is the goal. Next week, I'm hoping around Monday or Tuesday I'm going to put out a video

19
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:33,660
on pedophilia. Right now, everyone seems to be talking about pedophilia and politics.

20
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:40,660
I wrote a script about pedophilia about 6 months ago that I just didn't put out. I just

21
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,020
got lazy basically and the script is still just sitting on my hard drive. There's still

22
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,860
a lot of good research and work that went into that script, so I'm going to retool it

23
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,380
and update it and make that next week's video. After that, I'm considering doing a video

24
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,000
on Justin Trudeau because I'm a Canadian, I know a lot of the domestic policies that

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,620
he's implemented, and I know that he's kind of a joke among, you know, the, I guess you

26
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:11,740
can call it the skeptic circle on YouTube, like for some of his ridiculousness, but he's

27
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,280
done some stuff here at home in Canada that is equally ridiculous that has not really

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,560
made the rounds outside of Canada. So I'm going to do a video on Trudeau. I think that

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,740
will be the one after the pedo video. So obviously you're here watching this on this channel

30
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,720
so you probably know this, but just in case you don't for some reason, the channel that

31
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,560
this all happens on is youtube.com slash short fat otaku. And if you're interested in supporting

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,760
me in doing this, the Patreon for that channel is patreon.com slash short fat otaku. And

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,000
I also have some news about that Patreon as well. For a long time we've used the short

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,600
fat otaku Patreon as a way to fund all of our projects and come March 1st we're going

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,280
to be stopping that. On March 1st the SFO Patreon will be used only to fund the political

36
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,840
videos and to reflect that change, rather than it being a monthly Patreon, it's going

37
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,080
to become a per article Patreon. And the rules that I'm setting for that will be that every

38
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,420
time a political video comes out on this channel that is at least 20 minutes in length, it's

39
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,940
going to cycle a payment on Patreon. So if you like the political videos that come out

40
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,660
around here and you feel like financially supporting the channel patreon.com slash short

41
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,740
fat otaku would be the place to go. Another thing that I'm going to do on March 1st is

42
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,940
remove the backlog of our let's play series No Talent Gaming that is currently on the

43
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,620
short fat otaku channel. For a long time we used the SFO channel as a place to upload

44
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,100
our let's plays and there's like a thousand let's play videos on there. And what I've

45
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,880
realized is that when new people show up to watch our political videos and then they

46
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,020
sub for those political videos, even though we haven't uploaded a let's play to this channel

47
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:56,080
in over a year, their inbox and their suggested videos box gets bombarded with all of our

48
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,020
old let's play videos, even though they're old because there's just so many of them.

49
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,200
So on March 1st I'm removing them from this channel. Now they're not going to be gone,

50
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,220
if you are somebody who actually likes or liked our let's play series, they're not gone.

51
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,980
They have been re-uploaded on the NTG YouTube channel for about a year now. Their backups

52
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,860
are there and if you're interested in like going over there and seeing them you can do

53
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,540
so if you want to like repost your comments or rewatch the old let's plays for whatever

54
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,220
reason or you're just somebody who's new and wants to see what we're doing over there,

55
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:31,700
I'll talk about that in a minute. But on the SFO channel I am removing those videos primarily

56
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,460
because we want this to be a politically focused channel going forward and having those videos

57
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,520
around kind of interfered with that. NTG or No Talent Gaming is what we call our let's

58
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,420
play series and for a while like I said we had that hosted on the SFO channel but for

59
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:52,820
about a year now, since January 2016, it's been over at youtube.com slash c slash no

60
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,440
talent gaming and about six months ago we started streaming our let's play sessions

61
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:04,100
live on the NTG YouTube channel itself but also at twitch.tv slash short fat otaku, hitbox

62
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,260
tv slash short fat otaku and also over on beam at short fat otaku as well. And generally

63
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,620
how it works is that we'll stream a session of the let's play and we'll interact with

64
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,320
the chat, generally only the twitch chat even though we stream to four sources because the

65
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,340
program that we use to do so, restream, they don't have a unified chat application for

66
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,180
Macs and we do use a Mac to stream. So generally if you're tuning in and you want to talk to

67
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,220
us you know twitch is your best bet until they sort that out anyway. But generally we'll

68
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,620
stream a session of a game, it usually lasts between two and four hours and then the next

69
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:43,900
day that session will be uploaded at the NTG YouTube channel. We generally stream five

70
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,380
days a week, we generally do you know the usual Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

71
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:56,420
Friday at approximately seven pm. Though sometimes a little bit later. The chat room will attest

72
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,260
it's often a little bit later but we do our best to aim for seven. And if NTG sounds like

73
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,540
something that you want to financially support you can do so over at patreon.com slash no talent

74
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:13,820
gaming. We decided to split up the patreons for SFO and NTG, one to make it easier on us financially

75
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,300
just to understand where the money is coming from and what people are interested in and two

76
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,700
to make it more accountable and transparent to you guys. However NTG it is in fact a monthly

77
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:31,660
thing. If you're donating money to the NTG patreon there will be a monthly charge cycle

78
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,540
basically. And the whole point with that is that it's kind of hard to do you know significant

79
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,500
rewards tiers for a live let's play series you know everything that you that you're there to see

80
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,660
is already live you just go to twitch and you see it you know. I can't really release a video early

81
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:55,300
or whatever because you already see it live. So the NTG patreon is a monthly thing while the SFO

82
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,380
patreon will be a per political video thing. And the NTG patreon will also be set up on March 1st.

83
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,100
And I know that there are some of you out there who are currently donating to the SFO patreon

84
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:13,380
but primarily watch us for NTG there are at least two people I know who do that for sure. And if you

85
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,980
are one of those people you will want to make a switch on March 1st. Let's talk about some other

86
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:25,100
projects. For example the SFO channel originally back in like 2008 or 2009 started off as an anime

87
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:30,900
review channel. And we have largely kind of outgrown that and not completely because I still

88
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,380
like anime and Dave still likes anime. We have at least five scripts written and several of them

89
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,340
already shot just kind of unedited and and the voice work for them hasn't been done yet. So

90
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,100
there's there are still anime reviews coming down the pipes but it's not gonna be like the old days

91
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,500
where it was like one every two weeks because frankly the audience just isn't there for it

92
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:57,740
anymore. We did like four years of anime reviews and barely scratched the surface in terms of you

93
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,660
know interest on YouTube and then as soon as we started doing politics tons of people started

94
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:09,900
showing up. So at some point in the future probably at the end of March we're going to be moving our

95
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,940
anime reviews off of the SFO channel and onto its own channel as well. And I'll have more details

96
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,860
about that when the time comes but we really want the SFO channel to be focused on politics

97
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,100
because that is what you guys are here for and the other projects like the let's plays and the

98
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,220
anime reviews aren't dead they're just going somewhere else. At the same time I also started

99
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,020
up a channel called Gentrifying Games that was basically meant to be my game design project

100
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,100
which I'm still very interested in but I'm also going to broaden that channel to include any kind

101
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:44,700
of video game content that is not a let's play like reviews or like in-depth analysis or maybe

102
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,780
unboxing videos or perhaps best ofs or super cuts of the let's plays just in case some people don't

103
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,700
actually have the time to sit down and watch like 20 parts or 30 parts or 50 parts of a let's play.

104
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,180
And the main reason that I'm keeping all that stuff separate and not just putting all the gaming

105
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:05,620
stuff on NTG is because on a daily upload channel like no talent gaming stuff gets lost very easily.

106
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,940
You know if you were to spend say 10 hours or 20 hours editing some kind of long-form content and

107
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,300
then you upload it on a daily upload channel it immediately just gets washed away by everything

108
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,820
else that's on that channel you know. In a couple days the daily uploads will just kind of bury it.

109
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,380
So any kind of edited gaming content that is not a let's play will be also up over at the Gentrifying

110
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,660
Games channel and that's going to include game analysis and game design that's going to include

111
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,500
reviews that's going to include basically anything that I feel like will fit there.

112
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,540
And that's basically just going to leave the SFO channel for politics because most of the

113
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,220
viewers here are here for politics. I will occasionally like cross-promote them and link

114
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,780
back to them and say like hey if you're if you're a new viewer here come check out the let's plays

115
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,580
or something. I'm gonna do stuff like that once in a while but for the most part the videos that come

116
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:00,500
out here will be political stuff it'll be like gamergate stuff even though gamergate is not

117
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,380
really relevant anymore there are still some things to be talked about in that sphere so I'll

118
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:11,020
make a few videos on them and just sort of related culture warring type of stuff. And with all that

119
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,580
being said I also have some new social media stuff to bring up. It's a surprise to nobody that

120
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,540
both Twitter and Facebook are kind of going tits up at the moment so I've been looking into

121
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,180
alternative social media platforms just to see if anything's really interesting out there. I did

122
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,540
sign up for a Mines account at mines.com slash Shripetotaku but that's going to primarily be

123
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,980
used to talk about politics and promote the political and gamergate and other type of that

124
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,820
stuff. That platform is really built for that sort of discussion and the primary focus of that

125
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,740
account will be to build up that project. I also made an account over at Gab which I think is

126
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,460
positioning itself as an alternative to Twitter. Considering how draconian Twitter's getting with

127
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:56,740
like censoring people's tweets and banning people and like throttling them and stuff I'm going to

128
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:03,180
give Gab a serious try. And finally I'm also looking into vid.me. The main reason for that

129
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,580
is because YouTube even though it's it's not really going down the censorship route it has

130
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,900
always been kind of this this monolith this unreachable monolith with especially after it

131
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,900
got bought out by Google or if you had like a problem with your videos or like someone did

132
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:23,940
like an obvious an obvious false copyright claim or something on your videos and you had to like

133
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,420
message them and be like listen guys this is obviously something that's wrong. They would

134
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:33,060
never ever talk to you. YouTube is notoriously bad for just kind of letting the chips fall where

135
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,820
they may in terms of their content creators. And I really don't want to put all my eggs in one

136
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:42,300
basket in that regard. For a long time back in the day for example blip TV was one of the big

137
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:48,260
alternatives to YouTube and I was very big on blip back then. Believe it or not you know I got I

138
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:55,580
think it by the by the time blip finally shut down we were nearly at a million views. My most

139
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:04,620
popular video had over 200,000 views on blip and really from like 2008 to 2011 or so blip TV was

140
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,340
the place to be over YouTube and then you know maker studios bought them and then completely

141
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:14,860
drove the thing into the ground and that was the end of it. But now vid.me is around and they seem

142
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,820
to be very very promising as a great YouTube alternative and you will see at the beginning

143
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,540
at least all of the SFO political content mirrored over there and of course if the platform takes off

144
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,340
I'm probably gonna put some projects over there exclusively but for now this is a test run. I'm

145
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,900
gonna mirror up the SFO stuff the political stuff over there and we're gonna see how it goes. I am

146
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,780
aiming for the vid.me channel to be up around March 1st as well but it might be just a few

147
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,940
days later too and of course we still are on Twitter you can go to twitter.com slash short

148
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:52,820
flight otaku and facebook.com slash sf otaku and see us there and we'll be there basically until

149
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,900
either the service shuts down or they decide to ban us and considering how the services are going

150
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,380
right now I have no clue if and when that will ever happen but if it does we are looking into

151
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:07,460
these alternatives. So yeah that's pretty much it guys. If you're here for politics please please

152
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,780
