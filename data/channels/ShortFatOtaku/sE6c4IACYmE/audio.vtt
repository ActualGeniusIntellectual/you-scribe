WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.140
Hey guys, Dev here. I'm finally doing that Update Vlog I've been talking about on the

00:04.140 --> 00:07.660
stream so much recently. I'm actually doing this just before I work out. I seem to wear

00:07.660 --> 00:12.220
the same workout clothes every time I do a Vlog because I'm always doing it before or

00:12.220 --> 00:16.420
after a workout. There are four topics that I want to cover in this Update Vlog, and those

00:16.420 --> 00:22.420
are the main SFO channel, that's this channel, the NTG channel, that's our No Talent Gaming

00:22.420 --> 00:28.340
Let's Play stuff, our other projects, and our new social media accounts which we're

00:28.340 --> 00:32.460
starting out. Regarding SFO, Sharp at Otaku, this channel, the one that you're currently

00:32.460 --> 00:36.980
watching this Vlog on, I know that we initially started as an anime review channel, but it's

00:36.980 --> 00:42.140
become very obvious to you and to us that everyone's here for politics stuff. A lot

00:42.140 --> 00:47.260
of you guys found us during Gamergate, and a lot of you guys stick around for political

00:47.260 --> 00:54.260
videos. The political videos that we put up get, you know, 1000 or 2000 or 4000 views

00:55.100 --> 00:59.740
in the first, say, week, and the other stuff that we do doesn't get near that. So there's

00:59.740 --> 01:03.780
about 5000 people subscribed to this channel right now, and it's pretty obvious to me at

01:03.780 --> 01:08.380
least that about 4 fifths of you are here for that type of content. And now that I'm

01:08.380 --> 01:13.500
doing political videos regularly again, I'm going to make this channel, the main SFO channel,

01:13.500 --> 01:18.960
the home for that project. I'm going to aim for one new video of this type a week. I'm

01:18.960 --> 01:22.980
not sure if I'll hit it because, you know, real life sometimes gets in the way, but that

01:22.980 --> 01:27.460
is the goal. Next week, I'm hoping around Monday or Tuesday I'm going to put out a video

01:27.460 --> 01:33.660
on pedophilia. Right now, everyone seems to be talking about pedophilia and politics.

01:33.660 --> 01:40.660
I wrote a script about pedophilia about 6 months ago that I just didn't put out. I just

01:41.420 --> 01:45.020
got lazy basically and the script is still just sitting on my hard drive. There's still

01:45.020 --> 01:48.860
a lot of good research and work that went into that script, so I'm going to retool it

01:48.860 --> 01:53.380
and update it and make that next week's video. After that, I'm considering doing a video

01:53.380 --> 01:59.000
on Justin Trudeau because I'm a Canadian, I know a lot of the domestic policies that

01:59.000 --> 02:05.620
he's implemented, and I know that he's kind of a joke among, you know, the, I guess you

02:05.620 --> 02:11.740
can call it the skeptic circle on YouTube, like for some of his ridiculousness, but he's

02:11.740 --> 02:16.280
done some stuff here at home in Canada that is equally ridiculous that has not really

02:16.520 --> 02:21.560
made the rounds outside of Canada. So I'm going to do a video on Trudeau. I think that

02:21.560 --> 02:25.740
will be the one after the pedo video. So obviously you're here watching this on this channel

02:25.740 --> 02:29.720
so you probably know this, but just in case you don't for some reason, the channel that

02:29.720 --> 02:35.560
this all happens on is youtube.com slash short fat otaku. And if you're interested in supporting

02:35.560 --> 02:41.760
me in doing this, the Patreon for that channel is patreon.com slash short fat otaku. And

02:41.760 --> 02:46.000
I also have some news about that Patreon as well. For a long time we've used the short

02:46.720 --> 02:50.600
fat otaku Patreon as a way to fund all of our projects and come March 1st we're going

02:50.600 --> 02:57.280
to be stopping that. On March 1st the SFO Patreon will be used only to fund the political

02:57.280 --> 03:02.840
videos and to reflect that change, rather than it being a monthly Patreon, it's going

03:02.840 --> 03:08.080
to become a per article Patreon. And the rules that I'm setting for that will be that every

03:08.080 --> 03:13.420
time a political video comes out on this channel that is at least 20 minutes in length, it's

03:13.420 --> 03:17.940
going to cycle a payment on Patreon. So if you like the political videos that come out

03:17.940 --> 03:22.660
around here and you feel like financially supporting the channel patreon.com slash short

03:22.660 --> 03:27.740
fat otaku would be the place to go. Another thing that I'm going to do on March 1st is

03:27.740 --> 03:32.940
remove the backlog of our let's play series No Talent Gaming that is currently on the

03:32.940 --> 03:37.620
short fat otaku channel. For a long time we used the SFO channel as a place to upload

03:37.620 --> 03:41.100
our let's plays and there's like a thousand let's play videos on there. And what I've

03:41.100 --> 03:45.880
realized is that when new people show up to watch our political videos and then they

03:45.880 --> 03:50.020
sub for those political videos, even though we haven't uploaded a let's play to this channel

03:50.020 --> 03:56.080
in over a year, their inbox and their suggested videos box gets bombarded with all of our

03:56.080 --> 04:00.020
old let's play videos, even though they're old because there's just so many of them.

04:00.020 --> 04:04.200
So on March 1st I'm removing them from this channel. Now they're not going to be gone,

04:04.200 --> 04:09.220
if you are somebody who actually likes or liked our let's play series, they're not gone.

04:09.220 --> 04:13.980
They have been re-uploaded on the NTG YouTube channel for about a year now. Their backups

04:13.980 --> 04:17.860
are there and if you're interested in like going over there and seeing them you can do

04:17.860 --> 04:21.540
so if you want to like repost your comments or rewatch the old let's plays for whatever

04:21.540 --> 04:25.220
reason or you're just somebody who's new and wants to see what we're doing over there,

04:25.220 --> 04:31.700
I'll talk about that in a minute. But on the SFO channel I am removing those videos primarily

04:31.700 --> 04:36.460
because we want this to be a politically focused channel going forward and having those videos

04:36.460 --> 04:41.520
around kind of interfered with that. NTG or No Talent Gaming is what we call our let's

04:41.520 --> 04:45.420
play series and for a while like I said we had that hosted on the SFO channel but for

04:45.420 --> 04:52.820
about a year now, since January 2016, it's been over at youtube.com slash c slash no

04:52.820 --> 04:56.440
talent gaming and about six months ago we started streaming our let's play sessions

04:56.440 --> 05:04.100
live on the NTG YouTube channel itself but also at twitch.tv slash short fat otaku, hitbox

05:04.100 --> 05:10.260
tv slash short fat otaku and also over on beam at short fat otaku as well. And generally

05:10.260 --> 05:14.620
how it works is that we'll stream a session of the let's play and we'll interact with

05:14.620 --> 05:19.320
the chat, generally only the twitch chat even though we stream to four sources because the

05:19.320 --> 05:24.340
program that we use to do so, restream, they don't have a unified chat application for

05:24.340 --> 05:28.180
Macs and we do use a Mac to stream. So generally if you're tuning in and you want to talk to

05:28.180 --> 05:32.220
us you know twitch is your best bet until they sort that out anyway. But generally we'll

05:32.220 --> 05:36.620
stream a session of a game, it usually lasts between two and four hours and then the next

05:36.620 --> 05:43.900
day that session will be uploaded at the NTG YouTube channel. We generally stream five

05:43.900 --> 05:48.380
days a week, we generally do you know the usual Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

05:48.380 --> 05:56.420
Friday at approximately seven pm. Though sometimes a little bit later. The chat room will attest

05:56.420 --> 06:01.260
it's often a little bit later but we do our best to aim for seven. And if NTG sounds like

06:01.300 --> 06:06.540
something that you want to financially support you can do so over at patreon.com slash no talent

06:06.540 --> 06:13.820
gaming. We decided to split up the patreons for SFO and NTG, one to make it easier on us financially

06:13.820 --> 06:18.300
just to understand where the money is coming from and what people are interested in and two

06:18.300 --> 06:25.700
to make it more accountable and transparent to you guys. However NTG it is in fact a monthly

06:25.700 --> 06:31.660
thing. If you're donating money to the NTG patreon there will be a monthly charge cycle

06:31.660 --> 06:36.540
basically. And the whole point with that is that it's kind of hard to do you know significant

06:36.540 --> 06:42.500
rewards tiers for a live let's play series you know everything that you that you're there to see

06:42.500 --> 06:48.660
is already live you just go to twitch and you see it you know. I can't really release a video early

06:48.660 --> 06:55.300
or whatever because you already see it live. So the NTG patreon is a monthly thing while the SFO

06:55.300 --> 07:01.380
patreon will be a per political video thing. And the NTG patreon will also be set up on March 1st.

07:01.380 --> 07:06.100
And I know that there are some of you out there who are currently donating to the SFO patreon

07:06.100 --> 07:13.380
but primarily watch us for NTG there are at least two people I know who do that for sure. And if you

07:13.380 --> 07:17.980
are one of those people you will want to make a switch on March 1st. Let's talk about some other

07:17.980 --> 07:25.100
projects. For example the SFO channel originally back in like 2008 or 2009 started off as an anime

07:25.140 --> 07:30.900
review channel. And we have largely kind of outgrown that and not completely because I still

07:30.900 --> 07:35.380
like anime and Dave still likes anime. We have at least five scripts written and several of them

07:35.380 --> 07:40.340
already shot just kind of unedited and and the voice work for them hasn't been done yet. So

07:40.340 --> 07:45.100
there's there are still anime reviews coming down the pipes but it's not gonna be like the old days

07:45.100 --> 07:49.500
where it was like one every two weeks because frankly the audience just isn't there for it

07:49.500 --> 07:57.740
anymore. We did like four years of anime reviews and barely scratched the surface in terms of you

07:57.740 --> 08:02.660
know interest on YouTube and then as soon as we started doing politics tons of people started

08:02.660 --> 08:09.900
showing up. So at some point in the future probably at the end of March we're going to be moving our

08:09.900 --> 08:14.940
anime reviews off of the SFO channel and onto its own channel as well. And I'll have more details

08:14.940 --> 08:19.860
about that when the time comes but we really want the SFO channel to be focused on politics

08:19.860 --> 08:24.100
because that is what you guys are here for and the other projects like the let's plays and the

08:24.100 --> 08:29.220
anime reviews aren't dead they're just going somewhere else. At the same time I also started

08:29.220 --> 08:34.020
up a channel called Gentrifying Games that was basically meant to be my game design project

08:34.020 --> 08:38.100
which I'm still very interested in but I'm also going to broaden that channel to include any kind

08:38.100 --> 08:44.700
of video game content that is not a let's play like reviews or like in-depth analysis or maybe

08:44.700 --> 08:50.780
unboxing videos or perhaps best ofs or super cuts of the let's plays just in case some people don't

08:50.780 --> 08:55.700
actually have the time to sit down and watch like 20 parts or 30 parts or 50 parts of a let's play.

08:55.700 --> 08:59.180
And the main reason that I'm keeping all that stuff separate and not just putting all the gaming

08:59.180 --> 09:05.620
stuff on NTG is because on a daily upload channel like no talent gaming stuff gets lost very easily.

09:05.620 --> 09:11.940
You know if you were to spend say 10 hours or 20 hours editing some kind of long-form content and

09:11.980 --> 09:17.300
then you upload it on a daily upload channel it immediately just gets washed away by everything

09:17.300 --> 09:21.820
else that's on that channel you know. In a couple days the daily uploads will just kind of bury it.

09:21.820 --> 09:27.380
So any kind of edited gaming content that is not a let's play will be also up over at the Gentrifying

09:27.380 --> 09:32.660
Games channel and that's going to include game analysis and game design that's going to include

09:32.660 --> 09:36.500
reviews that's going to include basically anything that I feel like will fit there.

09:36.500 --> 09:41.540
And that's basically just going to leave the SFO channel for politics because most of the

09:41.540 --> 09:47.220
viewers here are here for politics. I will occasionally like cross-promote them and link

09:47.220 --> 09:51.780
back to them and say like hey if you're if you're a new viewer here come check out the let's plays

09:51.780 --> 09:55.580
or something. I'm gonna do stuff like that once in a while but for the most part the videos that come

09:55.580 --> 10:00.500
out here will be political stuff it'll be like gamergate stuff even though gamergate is not

10:00.500 --> 10:05.380
really relevant anymore there are still some things to be talked about in that sphere so I'll

10:05.380 --> 10:11.020
make a few videos on them and just sort of related culture warring type of stuff. And with all that

10:11.020 --> 10:15.580
being said I also have some new social media stuff to bring up. It's a surprise to nobody that

10:15.580 --> 10:19.540
both Twitter and Facebook are kind of going tits up at the moment so I've been looking into

10:19.540 --> 10:24.180
alternative social media platforms just to see if anything's really interesting out there. I did

10:24.180 --> 10:30.540
sign up for a Mines account at mines.com slash Shripetotaku but that's going to primarily be

10:30.540 --> 10:35.980
used to talk about politics and promote the political and gamergate and other type of that

10:35.980 --> 10:40.820
stuff. That platform is really built for that sort of discussion and the primary focus of that

10:40.820 --> 10:45.740
account will be to build up that project. I also made an account over at Gab which I think is

10:45.740 --> 10:50.460
positioning itself as an alternative to Twitter. Considering how draconian Twitter's getting with

10:50.460 --> 10:56.740
like censoring people's tweets and banning people and like throttling them and stuff I'm going to

10:56.740 --> 11:03.180
give Gab a serious try. And finally I'm also looking into vid.me. The main reason for that

11:03.180 --> 11:08.580
is because YouTube even though it's it's not really going down the censorship route it has

11:08.580 --> 11:13.900
always been kind of this this monolith this unreachable monolith with especially after it

11:13.900 --> 11:17.900
got bought out by Google or if you had like a problem with your videos or like someone did

11:17.900 --> 11:23.940
like an obvious an obvious false copyright claim or something on your videos and you had to like

11:23.940 --> 11:27.420
message them and be like listen guys this is obviously something that's wrong. They would

11:27.420 --> 11:33.060
never ever talk to you. YouTube is notoriously bad for just kind of letting the chips fall where

11:33.060 --> 11:36.820
they may in terms of their content creators. And I really don't want to put all my eggs in one

11:36.860 --> 11:42.300
basket in that regard. For a long time back in the day for example blip TV was one of the big

11:42.300 --> 11:48.260
alternatives to YouTube and I was very big on blip back then. Believe it or not you know I got I

11:48.260 --> 11:55.580
think it by the by the time blip finally shut down we were nearly at a million views. My most

11:55.580 --> 12:04.620
popular video had over 200,000 views on blip and really from like 2008 to 2011 or so blip TV was

12:04.620 --> 12:09.340
the place to be over YouTube and then you know maker studios bought them and then completely

12:09.340 --> 12:14.860
drove the thing into the ground and that was the end of it. But now vid.me is around and they seem

12:14.860 --> 12:19.820
to be very very promising as a great YouTube alternative and you will see at the beginning

12:19.820 --> 12:25.540
at least all of the SFO political content mirrored over there and of course if the platform takes off

12:25.540 --> 12:30.340
I'm probably gonna put some projects over there exclusively but for now this is a test run. I'm

12:30.340 --> 12:35.900
gonna mirror up the SFO stuff the political stuff over there and we're gonna see how it goes. I am

12:35.900 --> 12:40.780
aiming for the vid.me channel to be up around March 1st as well but it might be just a few

12:40.780 --> 12:44.940
days later too and of course we still are on Twitter you can go to twitter.com slash short

12:44.940 --> 12:52.820
flight otaku and facebook.com slash sf otaku and see us there and we'll be there basically until

12:52.820 --> 12:56.900
either the service shuts down or they decide to ban us and considering how the services are going

12:56.900 --> 13:01.380
right now I have no clue if and when that will ever happen but if it does we are looking into

13:01.380 --> 13:07.460
these alternatives. So yeah that's pretty much it guys. If you're here for politics please please

13:07.460 --> 13:12.780
stick around for next week's pedo video. If you like no talent gaming or if you are interested

13:12.780 --> 13:17.860
in checking out no talent gaming Naomi and I will be streaming Chrono Trigger tonight over at twitch.tv

13:17.860 --> 13:23.580
slash short flight otaku and any of the past let's plays and streams that we've done before are all

13:23.620 --> 13:29.180
up over at youtube.com slash C slash no talent game if you're interested in supporting financially

13:29.180 --> 13:35.140
any of these projects that would be at patreon.com slash short flight otaku and patreon.com slash no

13:35.140 --> 13:38.820
talent gaming and regardless of which of these projects you're actually interested in I will be

13:38.820 --> 13:43.580
very happy to see you there. Alright guys that's it for me I'm out I love you.
