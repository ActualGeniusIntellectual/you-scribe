0	12000	As far as I can tell, there's two types of responsibility, or maybe it's more accurate to say there's two layers of responsibility.
12000	18000	The first is the responsibility of doing what's expected of you, what a normal person would do in any given situation.
18000	23000	The second is the responsibility of doing what is required to handle the situation, regardless of anything else.
23000	29000	Let's call the first layer generic responsibility and the second final responsibility.
29000	33000	Here's an example. Let's say your house is on fire. What would a normie say your responsibility is?
33000	40000	Well, one, to get out of the house. Two, if possible, bring other people inside out of the house too, but not if the fire is too big.
40000	45000	And three, calling the fire department. What's the responsibility of the firefighter to put the fire out?
45000	53000	From the normie perspective, you as a regular person do not have the responsibility of ultimately stopping the fire or even undertaking huge risks to save others.
53000	57000	Your responsibility is to stand clear and alert the authorities. That's it.
57000	60000	Now let's say the house fire spreads and destroys other people's homes.
60000	66000	Assuming that you didn't start the fire yourself and assuming that you got yourself and your family out and then called the fire department,
66000	72000	nobody reasonable would consider you responsible for the disaster, even though you didn't chip in and physically fight the fire yourself.
72000	77000	But they might hold the firefighter responsible for the spread if he was negligent in his duties.
77000	83000	After you've called the fire department, your main responsibility is fulfilled, but the firefighter has to handle the situation.
83000	88000	There's nobody he can call, no higher authority he can appeal to. He's the authority. He's the one who has to do the job.
88000	96000	Of course, he can call for backup if he needs it, but it's the difference between somebody's responsibility being to alert the authorities and somebody's responsibility being to handle the situation.
96000	104000	A regular person might yell for Superman to come save him, but there is nobody for Superman to yell at himself. He has to do the job of saving.
104000	109000	For you to have generic responsibility, final responsibility has to be vested somewhere else outside of you.
109000	112000	After all, you can't call the authorities if there's no authority to call.
112000	118000	And of course, this arrangement applies to more than just house fires. When we were children, this sometimes made sense.
118000	124000	We all remember a situation where we had to appeal to our parents to be a decision maker rather than work something out ourselves.
124000	127000	We all remember being told not to fight bullies but get a teacher instead.
127000	134000	But as you get older, this logic starts to sound off. Don't own guns, just call the cops. Don't try to fix your stuff, just buy new stuff.
134000	138000	Don't risk it all and open a business, just collect a paycheck from somebody else.
138000	141000	Don't go through the headache of purchasing property, just rent it.
141000	146000	Don't have final responsibility for your life, just settle for generic responsibility.
146000	150000	Like a lot of stuff we talk about on this channel, it's obvious where this paradigm applies to leftoids.
150000	153000	But that doesn't mean that rightoids are immune to it.
153000	159000	Every time a traditionalist or religious person makes an appeal to culture or God, there's a good chance they're putting themselves in the same position.
159000	166000	The authority they appeal to doesn't have to be a person. All it has to do is bind your reasoning such that you end up neutering your own sense of responsibility.
166000	173000	If you ever catch yourself saying, I'm not responsible for what I'm doing, it's God or the state or my traditions or my family, you are in this boat.
173000	180000	It seems to me that part of becoming an adult means taking up the mantle of final responsibility, at least in some domains of your life.
180000	184000	It means understanding that, at least sometimes, there's no greater authority to appeal to.
184000	188000	You need to solve the problem, when it happens, with whatever you have on hand.
188000	194000	And there's nobody coming in to save you. It can't be God, it can't be your parents, it can't be the state. It has to be you.
194000	201000	And embracing final responsibility will require you to oppose all of those things in a non-trivial way at least once in your life.
201000	205000	Final responsibility means being the first to center, at the moment it's the most dangerous.
205000	213000	In the face of all this, I'm not surprised that there are people who actively try to remain subservient so that they have a lesser level of responsibility for their own life.
213000	223000	You can derisively call these people adult infants, but I think everybody's felt that drive at least once, during some exceptionally weak moment, where you would give almost anything to have that burden lifted.
223000	229000	If you're saying you've never felt that, you're lying. I want you to keep all of this in mind as we go over a few things.
229000	232000	I want you to see the philosophical throughline between the stuff I'm about to show you.
232000	237000	This image went viral last year. It was a flash in the pan thing, too mucho texo to actually last, but maybe you remember it.
237000	240000	If we want to address mental health, we need to dig deeper.
240000	248000	And then the shovel of intersectional social justice digs through the surface layers of medical model, pharma, DSM, pathologization, and uh, individualism.
248000	250000	Don't worry, we'll come back to that.
250000	255000	Into the lower chamber of floating buzzwords like violence, inequality, discrimination, poverty, racism, injustice, and so on.
255000	260000	And of course, all of these things can obviously majorly contribute to mental health problems. Don't kid yourself.
260000	266000	But despite that, it also seems to be the case that there's a huge correlation between socialism and degenerating mental health.
266000	270000	And socialists absolutely shit themselves in rage when you point it out.
270000	276000	But it's true. There's a study called Mental Illness and the Left, which shows that there's a weak association between mental illness and political ideology.
276000	280000	With that association growing stronger for the extremely left wing of politics.
280000	283000	The results hold up in regressions that adjust for age, sex, and race.
283000	289000	Figure 1 shows leftism positively correlated with a diagnosis of depression, BPD, bipolar, and schizophrenia.
289000	295000	Figure 3 shows leftism positively correlated with receiving professional treatment for any mental health problem.
295000	299000	It also shows extreme leftism as the only demographic where more men seek help than women.
299000	306000	Figure 5 shows rightism positively correlated with happiness. However, the only truly unhappy group were extremely leftist men.
306000	312000	Extremely leftist women are about as happy as center leftist and centrist people, but with a wider possible range up and down.
312000	321000	It is also interesting to note that on almost all of this data, mental health also deteriorates on the extremely rightist end of the scale, but not nearly to the extent as it does on the left.
321000	325000	And despite their deterioration, extremely rightist people are the happiest of them all.
325000	328000	People on the left like to cast this as capitalism's fault.
328000	332000	Rise in US suicides highlights need for new depression drugs.
332000	339000	We're depressed because we're overworked, underpaid, can't afford our student debt, can't afford a doctor, can't afford a home, can't afford a family.
339000	342000	While the people at the top take most of the value of our labor for themselves.
342000	344000	We don't need better drugs, we need a better economy.
344000	350000	I was actually on board with you until you said people at the top take most of the value of our labor for themselves, champ.
350000	357000	Yeah, the ability to actually do the life affirming things that most humans need to do, like start a family or have a happy home, is slipping away.
357000	363000	But I'm less likely to pin that on liberal capitalism than I am on the you'll own nothing and you'll be happy commie crowd.
363000	368000	Moreover, these people are scumfucks for trying to say, wow, mental illness is because you don't have socialism.
368000	371000	Who's surprised that these sleaze balls are trying to co-opt yet another thing?
371000	376000	But yeah, apparently individualism is an impediment to good mental health from the Prague point of view.
377000	383000	To any sane person who understands that humans aren't actually ants, knows that anybody who wants to strip you of your individuality is your enemy.
383000	387000	That's the first goal of any cult and doing so is certainly a fast track to crazy town.
387000	390000	Let's look at the mindsets of the people who actually believe this stuff.
390000	397000	The reason you want to be self-reliant so fucking badly is because capitalism has made your relationship with other people competitive and draining as shit.
397000	399000	It's forcing you into incel-hood.
399000	402000	That's quite the leap of logic, isn't it?
402000	405000	Self-reliance is problematic because capitalism?
405000	410000	Listen, if you're not the personality type that finds competition invigorating rather than draining, that's fine.
410000	412000	But you're not all people.
412000	414000	Defining and addressing toxic masculinity.
414000	415000	Common traits.
415000	416000	Mental and physical toughness.
416000	417000	Aggression.
417000	419000	Stoicism or not displaying emotion.
419000	420000	Heterosexism.
420000	423000	Self-sufficiency and emotional sensitivity.
423000	427000	Self-sufficiency is also toxic masculinity as well apparently.
427000	429000	As well as the traits of stoicism and toughness.
429000	432000	Both things that any sane human would understand are virtues.
432000	435000	These are traits required for responsibility and success.
435000	438000	You're not grinding, you're being exploited for your labor.
438000	443000	Listen, when your tweet goes viral, you get a maximum of one shoutout below it, not fucking 50.
443000	447000	But no, I fundamentally reject the idea that employment must be exploitative.
447000	448000	Hell, I work for myself.
448000	449000	Who's exploiting me?
449000	453000	As it turns out, these people just don't like self-employment.
453000	454000	Small businesses are overrated.
454000	456000	We shouldn't fetishize mom and pops.
456000	460000	They offer lower wages, skimpier benefits, and inferior labor protections.
460000	463000	Okay, so you guys hate the corpos and their monopolies, fair enough.
463000	466000	But you also hate people who are trying to build up real competition to them,
466000	468000	or create a more locally focused business model,
468000	470000	or break out of the wage cage and work for themselves.
470000	471000	Check out his justification.
471000	474000	Small businesses that pay lower wages, provide worse benefits,
474000	476000	are often exempt from important worker protections,
476000	479000	and are incompatible with the way unionization works in the US.
479000	480000	Oh, okay.
480000	483000	So it's because small businesses, being smaller than a giant corporation,
483000	486000	don't have the deep pockets to pay for all the shit that you like,
486000	488000	even as you wind up having to work for them.
488000	489000	Got it.
489000	492000	The person who works for themselves, rather than simply collecting a wage,
492000	494000	is by definition more self-sufficient.
494000	497000	In their situation, there's no larger authority to appeal to,
497000	499000	no boss whose responsibility it is to fix the problem.
499000	501000	The entrepreneur is the authority.
501000	502000	He has to be the fixer.
502000	505000	For a worker, maybe you get a dressing down if you make a mistake.
505000	507000	Maybe you lose your job, and that's no joke.
507000	509000	But to the small business owner, they lose their job
509000	512000	and all of the labor they've invested in building the business,
512000	513000	if they don't keep it running.
513000	515000	It's not the same level of responsibility.
515000	518000	During last year's riots, we saw a lot of stories from business owners like this one.
518000	521000	Watching looters bust down our family restaurant is heartbreaking.
521000	524000	Senseless. They're doing it while laughing and smirking.
524000	526000	Not gonna lie, I damn near shot a man tonight.
526000	529000	He threw that fucking rock at my family photo and looked right at me.
529000	532000	I said, you motherfucker, tears immediately rolling down my face.
532000	533000	I just can't no more.
533000	535000	I'm thankful I walked away, but fuck y'all.
535000	539000	To that demographic of people who would rather work in a business that they themselves own,
539000	541000	rather than collect a paycheck at somebody else's establishment,
541000	545000	their businesses aren't just places of employment, but extensions of the self.
545000	547000	You can understand why they react this way.
547000	551000	They value self-sufficiency, and the violence of the left takes it from them.
551000	553000	You can also understand why progs just don't get it,
553000	556000	and say nonsense like, LOL you're insured, don't worry about it.
556000	558000	It's never been about the insurance.
558000	562000	You can have garbage takes like, how can you value property over human lives?
562000	565000	But the truth is, people are always willing to defend what's theirs.
565000	567000	Socialists like to talk about workers owning their labor,
567000	569000	but that's largely just misdirection.
569000	571000	If you were to ever actually talk to a socialist long enough about it,
571000	575000	you'd eventually reach a point where you say, owning my labor means that I own it exclusively.
575000	577000	I own it, and nobody else does.
577000	578000	And it goes where I want.
578000	581000	I can trade it, or spend it, or keep it to myself as I see fit.
581000	583000	And they almost always inevitably say something like,
583000	587000	Well, workers don't actually own their labor personally.
587000	590000	Production is not a matter of personal rights, it should be controlled by all.
590000	593000	If your production is controlled by all, then it's not controlled by you.
593000	596000	Have you noticed yet what strings all of these things together?
596000	598000	It's the rejection of self-sufficiency,
598000	602000	and with it, the appeal to the authority and responsibility of the group.
603000	606000	It's the demand that you stop being responsible for fixing your own problems,
606000	610000	and that your responsibility ends with standing back and alerting the authorities.
610000	613000	Don't defend your stuff if anybody, the police, should do that.
613000	615000	Don't worry about damages, let the insurance company handle it.
615000	618000	Don't work for yourself, that puts you out of our grasp.
618000	620000	It's almost like they worship weakness,
620000	623000	because they understand that their ideology requires that weakness to function.
623000	625000	And I don't think I'm being hyperbolic when I say that.
625000	627000	Sure, there's no shortage of dumb takes by dumb people,
627000	631000	who are so fucking weak that I'm dumbfounded they can even get by in life.
631000	636000	These people are fragile, hateful, spiteful, wrathful, prideful, jealous,
636000	640000	vapid, intemperate, anti-moral, and just plain stupid.
640000	642000	Rather than confront their pathologies,
642000	645000	they would rather see society as self-pathologized,
645000	648000	so they don't have to feel as bad about being so genuinely awful.
648000	650000	And yes, they literally worship weakness.
650000	653000	The more unique and heroic and special the strong are,
653000	655000	the more the weak outnumber them.
655000	658000	The last man beats the first man, that's why he's the last man.
658000	660000	You're going to continue to perceive your society
660000	663000	degenerating into what you see as chaos and entropy and ruin.
663000	665000	I don't have to do anything. Nobody has to do anything.
665000	666000	It'll just happen.
666000	669000	Your kids will grow up to be more like me than you no matter what you do.
669000	672000	Weakness wins because weakness is by definition easier and more common.
672000	676000	My whole politics is preaching the gospel of weakness, and it's winning.
676000	678000	Cruel Leonidas demanded that you stand.
678000	681000	I ask only that you kneel. From Zerg Season 300.
681000	683000	Well yeah, this, but unironically.
683000	685000	This speech, of course, comes out of Arthur Chu,
685000	689000	whose only claim to fame was being world class at Jeopardy back in 2014.
689000	691000	He's been riding that high ever since,
691000	694000	and his devotion to nihilism cost him his marriage in 2017.
694000	697000	Being a master at something like Jeopardy takes a lot of hard work.
697000	701000	I guess Arthur just found it easier to degenerate and live the bare minimum,
701000	704000	but that is what a lot of the more prominent socialists require of the rest of us
704000	706000	for their lifestyles to continue.
706000	709000	They need the Arthur Chus of the world to buy into their own weakness.
709000	713000	They need those people to indulge in their vices to the point that self-control,
713000	716000	self-sufficiency, and self-respect become alien concepts to them.
716000	721000	They need a civilization of weak, angry, shallow, unrefined people
721000	723000	who are willing to listen to them unthinkingly.
723000	726000	And as long as they tell those people that their issues are external, not internal,
726000	730000	as long as they can keep pointing at some villain as the source of the world's problems,
730000	734000	as long as they can keep encouraging them to avoid looking at their own deficiencies,
734000	736000	the money will just keep rolling in.
736000	739000	Of course, I'm here making money off my content and my audience too,
739000	742000	and I'm also pointing the finger at some particularly unscrupulous people.
742000	744000	But I'm not going to sugarcoat anything for you.
744000	748000	If you have problems in your life, a lot of them can probably be solved
748000	750000	or at least eased by properly engaging with them.
750000	754000	That's not something that I can do for you, and donating your money to me won't help.
754000	756000	I do, of course, appreciate the donations,
756000	759000	but that's why I always say you should do it only when you're financially stable.
759000	763000	A lot of the videos I've released recently have all been leading up to this point.
763000	765000	Why Does the Purity Spiral Come for Everyone?
765000	769000	is a discussion on the nature of that weak, angry, shallow, unrefined mob
769000	771000	that BreadTubers and others have cultivated,
771000	774000	and how after getting rich off of them, they now fear their own audiences
774000	778000	and have been appealing to some greater responsibility in order to lessen their own.
778000	782000	The Private Life is a discussion on how the Marxist and the fascist
782000	785000	both desire to make the private public, the personal political,
785000	787000	leaving no room for individualism.
787000	790000	To these people, nothing can ever be exclusively yours,
790000	793000	and everything is within the purview of the collective.
793000	796000	There is no self-sufficiency. You are a part of them.
796000	799000	Trigger warnings don't work, as well as yesterday's accessibility video.
799000	801000	Our discussions on how the progressive cures for weakness
801000	803000	actually create more weakness in people,
803000	807000	how this weakness is fostered as if producing it is actually their goal,
807000	810000	and how strength is vilified because the strong have no need
810000	812000	for their indoctrination disguised as help.
812000	816000	The thread connecting everything is the vilification of self-sufficiency.
816000	818000	Here's another meme that's been floating around for a while.
818000	819000	Wait, not the mucho texta one.
819000	821000	This one says the same thing, but it's actually readable.
821000	822000	Hard to swallow pills.
822000	826000	A lot of y'all confuse capitalism with growing up and having adult responsibilities.
826000	828000	This is the truth.
828000	830000	Everybody thought they were going to be a teenager forever,
830000	832000	or at the very least they would grow up to live in the socialist paradise,
832000	834000	and now that they're not, now that they're out in the world
834000	837000	and discovering they don't have any tools to actually deal with it,
837000	841000	they would rather blame reality itself rather than getting to work on their own lives.
841000	844000	It's easier to resent competence than it is to become competent.
844000	848000	These people actually think that rather than taking on responsibility themselves,
848000	851000	this is a problem better solved with more bureaucracy
851000	853000	and more reshuffling of responsibility.
853000	857000	I once had an argument with a particularly stupid commie on an old Twitter account,
857000	860000	so I unfortunately can't show you the tweets like I usually do.
860000	864000	I mentioned that people often work hard and store resources away in preparation for a rainy day,
864000	869000	and he actually said that under a socialist society there would be no more rainy days to prepare for.
869000	873000	They believe their ideology is so all-encompassing, so all-powerful,
873000	876000	that preparation for future random circumstances is not only unnecessary,
876000	880000	but evidence that you're a counter-revolutionary element for your lack of belief in the system
880000	885000	and your individualistic, privatistic hoarding of resources away from the collective.
885000	889000	Unfortunately for them, no amount of government policy can replace the feeling
889000	892000	that you actually matter to other people, or that your life has a purpose.
892000	896000	You cannot outsource your humanity to the collectives that you no longer carry the responsibility
896000	899000	of developing into a moral, functional, well-rounded adult.
899000	904000	It is the fulfillment of responsibility, not its alleviation of some other agent that provides meaning.
904000	909000	Taking all of this into account, self-sufficiency must be vilified by the progressive and the socialist.
909000	913000	Self-respect is poison to the politics of victimhood, hence the person who has self-respect
913000	917000	must either be a bigot if part of the majority, or filled with self-hatred if not.
917000	922000	Self-reliance is the opposite of dependency, and socialism only works if everybody fully buys into
922000	925000	and therefore is dependent on the socialist system.
925000	927000	Hence the person who's prepared is detested by the socialist,
927000	931000	with the socialist calling him a hoarder, a kulak, a subversive element.
931000	935000	The act of preparation is the very definition of prioritizing the self over the collective,
935000	939000	of delinking yourself from dependency, of ridding yourself of weakness.
939000	943000	The people who are directly incentivized and seeing you weak will say something like,
943000	947000	Dependency creates cohesion. Cohesion leads to solidarity. Enough planning will fulfill all the demand.
947000	948000	Stop thinking about it.
948000	951000	The existence of an independent person is an affront to everything they stand for,
951000	955000	and every step you take towards self-sufficiency, no matter how big or small,
955000	959000	whether that's running your own business, or growing your own food, or engaging in local trade,
959000	964000	it all flies in the face of any sort of grand reordering of society, or large-scale redistribution effort.
964000	967000	Owning your labour might mean that you sell it to a capitalist,
967000	969000	and maybe you even get exploited in that process.
969000	974000	But the flip side is, it absolutely means that the communists don't get to give it to other people freely.
974000	978000	I'm not saying you have to completely delink from society and live as a mountain man.
978000	983000	We derive meaning not only from self-sufficiency, but also from consensual connection with others.
983000	985000	But the key word there is consensual.
985000	988000	I consent to being close with my friends. I don't consent to being close with everybody.
988000	990000	As liberals, we have that choice.
990000	994000	There will be times where it's better for us to buy into society and reap its benefits.
994000	997000	There will be times where it's better to go it alone and be the masters of our lives.
997000	999000	But we make the choice, not anybody else.
999000	1002000	However, for the socialist, there is no choice.
1002000	1006000	They have to worship weakness, because weak people are the fuel for their engine.
1006000	1010000	They have to despise self-sufficiency, because the more individualistic you are,
1010000	1012000	the more you delink from their dependency.
1012000	1015000	They have to reject final responsibility for their lives,
1015000	1019000	because it's the only way they can cope with being such massive fucking failures.
1019000	1022000	And if you let them, they'll drag you down too.
1022000	1026000	Alright guys, that about does it for me. Thanks for watching the video. Hope you enjoyed it.
1026000	1029000	A lot of the videos I've been making the past couple weeks have definitely led up to this one.
1029000	1032000	I don't know if I'll continue down this road. Maybe, maybe not.
1032000	1033000	There's many things I want to talk about.
1033000	1036000	As always, tune into Game Boomers tonight for more Halloween fun.
1036000	1038000	I'll see you there. I love you.
