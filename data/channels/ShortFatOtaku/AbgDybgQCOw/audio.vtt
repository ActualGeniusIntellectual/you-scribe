00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
As far as I can tell, there's two types of responsibility, or maybe it's more accurate to say there's two layers of responsibility.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
The first is the responsibility of doing what's expected of you, what a normal person would do in any given situation.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
The second is the responsibility of doing what is required to handle the situation, regardless of anything else.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Let's call the first layer generic responsibility and the second final responsibility.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Here's an example. Let's say your house is on fire. What would a normie say your responsibility is?

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
Well, one, to get out of the house. Two, if possible, bring other people inside out of the house too, but not if the fire is too big.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
And three, calling the fire department. What's the responsibility of the firefighter to put the fire out?

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
From the normie perspective, you as a regular person do not have the responsibility of ultimately stopping the fire or even undertaking huge risks to save others.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Your responsibility is to stand clear and alert the authorities. That's it.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Now let's say the house fire spreads and destroys other people's homes.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.000
Assuming that you didn't start the fire yourself and assuming that you got yourself and your family out and then called the fire department,

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
nobody reasonable would consider you responsible for the disaster, even though you didn't chip in and physically fight the fire yourself.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
But they might hold the firefighter responsible for the spread if he was negligent in his duties.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
After you've called the fire department, your main responsibility is fulfilled, but the firefighter has to handle the situation.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
There's nobody he can call, no higher authority he can appeal to. He's the authority. He's the one who has to do the job.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
Of course, he can call for backup if he needs it, but it's the difference between somebody's responsibility being to alert the authorities and somebody's responsibility being to handle the situation.

01:36.000 --> 01:44.000
A regular person might yell for Superman to come save him, but there is nobody for Superman to yell at himself. He has to do the job of saving.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
For you to have generic responsibility, final responsibility has to be vested somewhere else outside of you.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
After all, you can't call the authorities if there's no authority to call.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.000
And of course, this arrangement applies to more than just house fires. When we were children, this sometimes made sense.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.000
We all remember a situation where we had to appeal to our parents to be a decision maker rather than work something out ourselves.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
We all remember being told not to fight bullies but get a teacher instead.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
But as you get older, this logic starts to sound off. Don't own guns, just call the cops. Don't try to fix your stuff, just buy new stuff.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
Don't risk it all and open a business, just collect a paycheck from somebody else.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Don't go through the headache of purchasing property, just rent it.

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
Don't have final responsibility for your life, just settle for generic responsibility.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
Like a lot of stuff we talk about on this channel, it's obvious where this paradigm applies to leftoids.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
But that doesn't mean that rightoids are immune to it.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
Every time a traditionalist or religious person makes an appeal to culture or God, there's a good chance they're putting themselves in the same position.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
The authority they appeal to doesn't have to be a person. All it has to do is bind your reasoning such that you end up neutering your own sense of responsibility.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
If you ever catch yourself saying, I'm not responsible for what I'm doing, it's God or the state or my traditions or my family, you are in this boat.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
It seems to me that part of becoming an adult means taking up the mantle of final responsibility, at least in some domains of your life.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
It means understanding that, at least sometimes, there's no greater authority to appeal to.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
You need to solve the problem, when it happens, with whatever you have on hand.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.000
And there's nobody coming in to save you. It can't be God, it can't be your parents, it can't be the state. It has to be you.

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
And embracing final responsibility will require you to oppose all of those things in a non-trivial way at least once in your life.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
Final responsibility means being the first to center, at the moment it's the most dangerous.

03:25.000 --> 03:33.000
In the face of all this, I'm not surprised that there are people who actively try to remain subservient so that they have a lesser level of responsibility for their own life.

03:33.000 --> 03:43.000
You can derisively call these people adult infants, but I think everybody's felt that drive at least once, during some exceptionally weak moment, where you would give almost anything to have that burden lifted.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
If you're saying you've never felt that, you're lying. I want you to keep all of this in mind as we go over a few things.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
I want you to see the philosophical throughline between the stuff I'm about to show you.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
This image went viral last year. It was a flash in the pan thing, too mucho texo to actually last, but maybe you remember it.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
If we want to address mental health, we need to dig deeper.

04:00.000 --> 04:08.000
And then the shovel of intersectional social justice digs through the surface layers of medical model, pharma, DSM, pathologization, and uh, individualism.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Don't worry, we'll come back to that.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
Into the lower chamber of floating buzzwords like violence, inequality, discrimination, poverty, racism, injustice, and so on.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
And of course, all of these things can obviously majorly contribute to mental health problems. Don't kid yourself.

04:20.000 --> 04:26.000
But despite that, it also seems to be the case that there's a huge correlation between socialism and degenerating mental health.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
And socialists absolutely shit themselves in rage when you point it out.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
But it's true. There's a study called Mental Illness and the Left, which shows that there's a weak association between mental illness and political ideology.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
With that association growing stronger for the extremely left wing of politics.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
The results hold up in regressions that adjust for age, sex, and race.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
Figure 1 shows leftism positively correlated with a diagnosis of depression, BPD, bipolar, and schizophrenia.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
Figure 3 shows leftism positively correlated with receiving professional treatment for any mental health problem.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
It also shows extreme leftism as the only demographic where more men seek help than women.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
Figure 5 shows rightism positively correlated with happiness. However, the only truly unhappy group were extremely leftist men.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
Extremely leftist women are about as happy as center leftist and centrist people, but with a wider possible range up and down.

05:12.000 --> 05:21.000
It is also interesting to note that on almost all of this data, mental health also deteriorates on the extremely rightist end of the scale, but not nearly to the extent as it does on the left.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
And despite their deterioration, extremely rightist people are the happiest of them all.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
People on the left like to cast this as capitalism's fault.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
Rise in US suicides highlights need for new depression drugs.

05:32.000 --> 05:39.000
We're depressed because we're overworked, underpaid, can't afford our student debt, can't afford a doctor, can't afford a home, can't afford a family.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
While the people at the top take most of the value of our labor for themselves.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
We don't need better drugs, we need a better economy.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
I was actually on board with you until you said people at the top take most of the value of our labor for themselves, champ.

05:50.000 --> 05:57.000
Yeah, the ability to actually do the life affirming things that most humans need to do, like start a family or have a happy home, is slipping away.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
But I'm less likely to pin that on liberal capitalism than I am on the you'll own nothing and you'll be happy commie crowd.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
Moreover, these people are scumfucks for trying to say, wow, mental illness is because you don't have socialism.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Who's surprised that these sleaze balls are trying to co-opt yet another thing?

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
But yeah, apparently individualism is an impediment to good mental health from the Prague point of view.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
To any sane person who understands that humans aren't actually ants, knows that anybody who wants to strip you of your individuality is your enemy.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
That's the first goal of any cult and doing so is certainly a fast track to crazy town.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Let's look at the mindsets of the people who actually believe this stuff.

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
The reason you want to be self-reliant so fucking badly is because capitalism has made your relationship with other people competitive and draining as shit.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
It's forcing you into incel-hood.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
That's quite the leap of logic, isn't it?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Self-reliance is problematic because capitalism?

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
Listen, if you're not the personality type that finds competition invigorating rather than draining, that's fine.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
But you're not all people.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Defining and addressing toxic masculinity.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Common traits.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Mental and physical toughness.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Aggression.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Stoicism or not displaying emotion.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Heterosexism.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Self-sufficiency and emotional sensitivity.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Self-sufficiency is also toxic masculinity as well apparently.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
As well as the traits of stoicism and toughness.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Both things that any sane human would understand are virtues.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
These are traits required for responsibility and success.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
You're not grinding, you're being exploited for your labor.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
Listen, when your tweet goes viral, you get a maximum of one shoutout below it, not fucking 50.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
But no, I fundamentally reject the idea that employment must be exploitative.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Hell, I work for myself.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Who's exploiting me?

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
As it turns out, these people just don't like self-employment.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Small businesses are overrated.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
We shouldn't fetishize mom and pops.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
They offer lower wages, skimpier benefits, and inferior labor protections.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
Okay, so you guys hate the corpos and their monopolies, fair enough.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
But you also hate people who are trying to build up real competition to them,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
or create a more locally focused business model,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
or break out of the wage cage and work for themselves.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Check out his justification.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
Small businesses that pay lower wages, provide worse benefits,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
are often exempt from important worker protections,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
and are incompatible with the way unionization works in the US.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Oh, okay.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
So it's because small businesses, being smaller than a giant corporation,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
don't have the deep pockets to pay for all the shit that you like,

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
even as you wind up having to work for them.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Got it.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
The person who works for themselves, rather than simply collecting a wage,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
is by definition more self-sufficient.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
In their situation, there's no larger authority to appeal to,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
no boss whose responsibility it is to fix the problem.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
The entrepreneur is the authority.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
He has to be the fixer.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
For a worker, maybe you get a dressing down if you make a mistake.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
Maybe you lose your job, and that's no joke.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
But to the small business owner, they lose their job

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
and all of the labor they've invested in building the business,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
if they don't keep it running.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
It's not the same level of responsibility.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
During last year's riots, we saw a lot of stories from business owners like this one.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Watching looters bust down our family restaurant is heartbreaking.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
Senseless. They're doing it while laughing and smirking.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Not gonna lie, I damn near shot a man tonight.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
He threw that fucking rock at my family photo and looked right at me.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
I said, you motherfucker, tears immediately rolling down my face.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
I just can't no more.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
I'm thankful I walked away, but fuck y'all.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
To that demographic of people who would rather work in a business that they themselves own,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
rather than collect a paycheck at somebody else's establishment,

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
their businesses aren't just places of employment, but extensions of the self.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
You can understand why they react this way.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
They value self-sufficiency, and the violence of the left takes it from them.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
You can also understand why progs just don't get it,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
and say nonsense like, LOL you're insured, don't worry about it.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
It's never been about the insurance.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
You can have garbage takes like, how can you value property over human lives?

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
But the truth is, people are always willing to defend what's theirs.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
Socialists like to talk about workers owning their labor,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
but that's largely just misdirection.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
If you were to ever actually talk to a socialist long enough about it,

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
you'd eventually reach a point where you say, owning my labor means that I own it exclusively.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
I own it, and nobody else does.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
And it goes where I want.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I can trade it, or spend it, or keep it to myself as I see fit.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
And they almost always inevitably say something like,

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
Well, workers don't actually own their labor personally.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Production is not a matter of personal rights, it should be controlled by all.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
If your production is controlled by all, then it's not controlled by you.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Have you noticed yet what strings all of these things together?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
It's the rejection of self-sufficiency,

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
and with it, the appeal to the authority and responsibility of the group.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
It's the demand that you stop being responsible for fixing your own problems,

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
and that your responsibility ends with standing back and alerting the authorities.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Don't defend your stuff if anybody, the police, should do that.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Don't worry about damages, let the insurance company handle it.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Don't work for yourself, that puts you out of our grasp.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
It's almost like they worship weakness,

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
because they understand that their ideology requires that weakness to function.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
And I don't think I'm being hyperbolic when I say that.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Sure, there's no shortage of dumb takes by dumb people,

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
who are so fucking weak that I'm dumbfounded they can even get by in life.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
These people are fragile, hateful, spiteful, wrathful, prideful, jealous,

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
vapid, intemperate, anti-moral, and just plain stupid.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Rather than confront their pathologies,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
they would rather see society as self-pathologized,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
so they don't have to feel as bad about being so genuinely awful.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
And yes, they literally worship weakness.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
The more unique and heroic and special the strong are,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
the more the weak outnumber them.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
The last man beats the first man, that's why he's the last man.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
You're going to continue to perceive your society

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
degenerating into what you see as chaos and entropy and ruin.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
I don't have to do anything. Nobody has to do anything.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
It'll just happen.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
Your kids will grow up to be more like me than you no matter what you do.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Weakness wins because weakness is by definition easier and more common.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
My whole politics is preaching the gospel of weakness, and it's winning.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Cruel Leonidas demanded that you stand.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
I ask only that you kneel. From Zerg Season 300.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Well yeah, this, but unironically.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
This speech, of course, comes out of Arthur Chu,

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
whose only claim to fame was being world class at Jeopardy back in 2014.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
He's been riding that high ever since,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
and his devotion to nihilism cost him his marriage in 2017.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Being a master at something like Jeopardy takes a lot of hard work.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
I guess Arthur just found it easier to degenerate and live the bare minimum,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
but that is what a lot of the more prominent socialists require of the rest of us

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
for their lifestyles to continue.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
They need the Arthur Chus of the world to buy into their own weakness.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
They need those people to indulge in their vices to the point that self-control,

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
self-sufficiency, and self-respect become alien concepts to them.

11:56.000 --> 12:01.000
They need a civilization of weak, angry, shallow, unrefined people

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
who are willing to listen to them unthinkingly.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
And as long as they tell those people that their issues are external, not internal,

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
as long as they can keep pointing at some villain as the source of the world's problems,

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
as long as they can keep encouraging them to avoid looking at their own deficiencies,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
the money will just keep rolling in.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
Of course, I'm here making money off my content and my audience too,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
and I'm also pointing the finger at some particularly unscrupulous people.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
But I'm not going to sugarcoat anything for you.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
If you have problems in your life, a lot of them can probably be solved

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
or at least eased by properly engaging with them.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
That's not something that I can do for you, and donating your money to me won't help.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I do, of course, appreciate the donations,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
but that's why I always say you should do it only when you're financially stable.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
A lot of the videos I've released recently have all been leading up to this point.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Why Does the Purity Spiral Come for Everyone?

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
is a discussion on the nature of that weak, angry, shallow, unrefined mob

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
that BreadTubers and others have cultivated,

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
and how after getting rich off of them, they now fear their own audiences

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
and have been appealing to some greater responsibility in order to lessen their own.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
The Private Life is a discussion on how the Marxist and the fascist

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
both desire to make the private public, the personal political,

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
leaving no room for individualism.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
To these people, nothing can ever be exclusively yours,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
and everything is within the purview of the collective.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
There is no self-sufficiency. You are a part of them.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Trigger warnings don't work, as well as yesterday's accessibility video.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Our discussions on how the progressive cures for weakness

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
actually create more weakness in people,

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
how this weakness is fostered as if producing it is actually their goal,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
and how strength is vilified because the strong have no need

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
for their indoctrination disguised as help.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
The thread connecting everything is the vilification of self-sufficiency.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Here's another meme that's been floating around for a while.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Wait, not the mucho texta one.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
This one says the same thing, but it's actually readable.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Hard to swallow pills.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
A lot of y'all confuse capitalism with growing up and having adult responsibilities.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
This is the truth.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
Everybody thought they were going to be a teenager forever,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
or at the very least they would grow up to live in the socialist paradise,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
and now that they're not, now that they're out in the world

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
and discovering they don't have any tools to actually deal with it,

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
they would rather blame reality itself rather than getting to work on their own lives.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
It's easier to resent competence than it is to become competent.

14:04.000 --> 14:08.000
These people actually think that rather than taking on responsibility themselves,

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
this is a problem better solved with more bureaucracy

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
and more reshuffling of responsibility.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.000
I once had an argument with a particularly stupid commie on an old Twitter account,

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
so I unfortunately can't show you the tweets like I usually do.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
I mentioned that people often work hard and store resources away in preparation for a rainy day,

14:24.000 --> 14:29.000
and he actually said that under a socialist society there would be no more rainy days to prepare for.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.000
They believe their ideology is so all-encompassing, so all-powerful,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
that preparation for future random circumstances is not only unnecessary,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
but evidence that you're a counter-revolutionary element for your lack of belief in the system

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
and your individualistic, privatistic hoarding of resources away from the collective.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.000
Unfortunately for them, no amount of government policy can replace the feeling

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
that you actually matter to other people, or that your life has a purpose.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
You cannot outsource your humanity to the collectives that you no longer carry the responsibility

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
of developing into a moral, functional, well-rounded adult.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
It is the fulfillment of responsibility, not its alleviation of some other agent that provides meaning.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.000
Taking all of this into account, self-sufficiency must be vilified by the progressive and the socialist.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Self-respect is poison to the politics of victimhood, hence the person who has self-respect

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
must either be a bigot if part of the majority, or filled with self-hatred if not.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
Self-reliance is the opposite of dependency, and socialism only works if everybody fully buys into

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
and therefore is dependent on the socialist system.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Hence the person who's prepared is detested by the socialist,

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
with the socialist calling him a hoarder, a kulak, a subversive element.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
The act of preparation is the very definition of prioritizing the self over the collective,

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
of delinking yourself from dependency, of ridding yourself of weakness.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
The people who are directly incentivized and seeing you weak will say something like,

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Dependency creates cohesion. Cohesion leads to solidarity. Enough planning will fulfill all the demand.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Stop thinking about it.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
The existence of an independent person is an affront to everything they stand for,

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
and every step you take towards self-sufficiency, no matter how big or small,

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
whether that's running your own business, or growing your own food, or engaging in local trade,

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
it all flies in the face of any sort of grand reordering of society, or large-scale redistribution effort.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
Owning your labour might mean that you sell it to a capitalist,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
and maybe you even get exploited in that process.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
But the flip side is, it absolutely means that the communists don't get to give it to other people freely.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
I'm not saying you have to completely delink from society and live as a mountain man.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
We derive meaning not only from self-sufficiency, but also from consensual connection with others.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
But the key word there is consensual.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
I consent to being close with my friends. I don't consent to being close with everybody.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
As liberals, we have that choice.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
There will be times where it's better for us to buy into society and reap its benefits.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
There will be times where it's better to go it alone and be the masters of our lives.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
But we make the choice, not anybody else.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
However, for the socialist, there is no choice.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
They have to worship weakness, because weak people are the fuel for their engine.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
They have to despise self-sufficiency, because the more individualistic you are,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
the more you delink from their dependency.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
They have to reject final responsibility for their lives,

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
because it's the only way they can cope with being such massive fucking failures.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
And if you let them, they'll drag you down too.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
Alright guys, that about does it for me. Thanks for watching the video. Hope you enjoyed it.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
A lot of the videos I've been making the past couple weeks have definitely led up to this one.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
I don't know if I'll continue down this road. Maybe, maybe not.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
There's many things I want to talk about.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
As always, tune into Game Boomers tonight for more Halloween fun.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I'll see you there. I love you.
