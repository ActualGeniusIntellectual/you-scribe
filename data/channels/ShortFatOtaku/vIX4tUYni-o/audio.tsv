0	7700	Oh boy, is this becoming the Jordan Peterson channel?
7700	10520	Because this is like the third video in a row that relies on one of his quotes to start
10520	11520	a conversation.
11520	14600	While I do like Jordan Peterson to a point, I also recognize that when he gets out of
14600	17280	his psychology wheelhouse, he's honestly a little bit shaky.
17280	21080	The psych stuff is 100% on point, but his career shifted away from psychology to being
21080	25040	a pop scientist years ago, and his non-psych takes are hit and miss.
25040	28540	But nonetheless, there's a few clips from his recent Andy Ngo video that have gone viral,
28540	32380	and one specific clip that the left has decided to repost and mock everywhere.
32380	35220	So I would like to analyze it, because I think it actually contains some wisdom.
35220	39740	What is the psychology of this mob violence?
39740	47980	When I see it, like I don't even recognize some of these, they seem animalistic is what
47980	48980	I mean.
48980	52500	No, they're worse than animals.
52500	56460	They're worse than animals, because animals, they just kill to eat, you know?
56460	59940	Human beings, they have a twist in them that makes them far worse than animals when they
59940	60940	really get going.
60940	64300	Well, I think it's, I think, you really want to know what I think?
64300	69820	I think it's revenge against God for the crime of being.
69820	72400	That's really what I think.
72400	74860	It's Cain and Cain and Abel.
74860	77340	It's like, oh, Abel's your, Abel's your guy, eh, God?
77340	80780	How about if I take him out in the field and beat him to death?
80780	82500	How do you feel about that?
82500	86820	All my sacrifices went unrewarded.
86820	90060	Now that actually does sound a bit too dramatic.
90060	93860	And boy, did Twitter not hesitate to point out exactly how dramatic it sounds.
93860	97900	I'll let these reactions scroll by on the screen while we talk about this.
97900	102380	Feel free to pause at any time and read these in detail, because this clip has like 3,000
102380	106280	quote tweets, and the vast majority of them are terminally online leftist activists with
106280	109900	pit crew avatars, flags and emojis representing their support of the current thing in their
109900	114500	name and comments that don't actually count as anything even resembling a real analysis.
114500	116180	Just making fun of the man because they don't like him.
116180	119980	And they find the idea that the foundation upon which their violent socialist activism
119980	121920	sits is a hatred of life itself.
121920	124820	How can that be, they say, or for the working class after all?
124820	128180	We want to ameliorate the material conditions of everybody.
128180	129180	We want freedom.
129180	133120	We want good ends and harm reduction and equality and every other buzzword you can think of
133120	136820	that the left likes to label itself with in an effort to claim the moral high ground.
136820	141060	But as Peterson said in that same interview, it's not any sort of moral high ground that
141060	166440	causes them to laugh at suffering.
166440	180480	Rather, it's that they've convinced themselves that their cause is so righteous that anybody
180480	184420	who opposes them must be ontologically evil by default, and they can do what they will
184420	185420	with them.
185420	186420	Or at least that's the reason they tell themselves.
186420	189820	No really, that's actually the text of a common meme right now that they love to use.
189820	193560	It's fitting that they chose Patrick Bateman, the American Psycho himself, as the pitcher
193560	194560	for that one.
194560	198680	Let's actually examine this idea, that the radical left is rebelling against God for
198680	199680	the crime of being.
199680	201320	We can take God out of it, frankly.
201320	202480	The analysis is the same.
202480	206200	There's multiple levels to go down until we reach the bottom, so let's start digging.
206200	208280	Level 1, where the socialist is simply self-interested.
224560	230920	Oh, have I used that clip too much recently?
230920	246960	Okay, how about this one instead?
246960	251180	It's not hard to find some conservative YouTube channel, like Crowder's Change My Mind thing
251180	255180	or Campus Reform, where the host interviews some dipshit university students and gets
255180	258420	them to admit the most basic hypocrisies about their socialist ideals.
258420	263040	The example on screen is about a GPA redistribution, where the left-leaning students are asked
263040	267700	why shouldn't we equalize the GPA of high-achieving students with low-achieving ones?
267700	270880	The students all give the same reply, because the low-achieving ones didn't work as hard
270880	271880	as they did.
271880	275980	When confronted with the very real possibility that high earners and low earners in society
275980	280860	function the same way, making income redistribution just as offensive as GPA distribution is,
280860	282740	almost all of their brains shut down.
282740	286340	This is a funny gotcha moment, sure, but it serves to show that a lot of young socialists
286340	290020	are either idiots who haven't thought enough about their ideas, or they're entirely unprincipled
290020	292700	and simply looking to do what benefits them.
292700	295260	Redistribution when they're on the bottom, rugged individualism when they're on the top.
295260	296900	Frankly, it's probably a bit of both.
296900	300900	Level 2, where the socialist directly sides with a foreign evil, because at least it is
300900	301900	not the familiar.
301900	306900	During the Vietnam War, we were actually the very first party in the US to stage a demonstration
306900	311380	against the Vietnam War, in like 1968, when most people just kind of thought the war was
311380	314380	whatever, you know, there wasn't a massive anti-war movement.
314380	319660	And I think, you know, obviously the Vietnamese people themselves fought a heroic battle and
319660	321960	gained their liberation from US imperialism.
321960	325540	It's not hard to find people on the left who worship the genocidal totalitarian regimes
325540	326820	of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao.
326820	330260	And I don't just mean the overt tankies, though obviously them.
330260	334340	Even the breadtubers, the so-called libertarian socialists, while they might criticize the
334340	338220	Soviet regime from time to time, especially during a debate with a non-socialist, where
338220	341980	they know that an audience outside of their own insular crowd might be watching, catch
341980	347220	them talking on their own, to their own communities, and you'll likely hear some variant of, well,
347220	351180	socialist regimes around the world were sabotaged by capitalists who refused to trade with them.
351180	355380	Because I guess socialism requires an outside capitalist society to keep trading with them,
355380	356700	if it's going to work?
356700	360740	Modern socialist apologia ranges from the Hall of D'Amour was an accident, not a genocide,
360740	365420	to the kulaks deserved it for resisting collectivization, actually, to the exceptionally grotesque the
365420	370380	Communist Party of Peru did not boil children alive, but they did occasionally use scalding
370380	374180	water as a method of execution, which has to be the craziest commie simping I've seen
374180	375180	yet.
375180	378300	I made a video detailing this general idea in the past, revolving around this quote of
378300	379300	Aristotle's.
379300	383580	It is the mark of a tyrant to have men of foreign extraction rather than citizens as
383580	387760	guests at table and companions, feeling that citizens are hostile but strangers make no
387760	388760	claim against him.
388800	391840	I probably didn't do that video concept proper justice back then, but hey, we all
391840	392840	get better over time.
392840	397720	And while before I used the example of leftists loving immigrants as oddities from a foreign
397720	400640	land while hating their own countrymen, I'll look at it from a different angle this time.
400640	403960	Have you ever noticed that if you happen to know a couple where one partner is secretly
403960	407280	abusive of the other, when you think about your interactions with them, you will begin
407280	408360	to notice a pattern?
408360	412060	More specifically, that the abusive person while at a social event with their partner
412060	416580	is not only quick to brush off their partner's complaints, but also gracious with outsiders
416580	418540	and heavily invested in keeping the peace.
418540	420020	There's a limit to this, of course.
420020	423700	There are extraordinary stories where the abuser snaps publicly, but you know what I
423700	424700	mean.
424700	425700	There's two reasons for this.
425700	429620	One, it's because the abusive dynamic is a product of the relationship and the abuser
429620	431980	feels that outsiders should not be privy to it.
431980	436140	Two, it's because the outsiders do not know the abuser in that way and so they cannot
436140	438140	peer into the darker parts of his soul.
438140	442300	This is all just guesswork by me, but that idea maps onto Aristotle's view of tyrants
442300	446160	well, and it also maps onto the socialist who is willing to support the evil other over
446160	447680	his own familiar homeland.
447680	451740	Level three, where the socialist directly sides with domestic evil, because a socialist
451740	454840	revolution must come from the margins of society.
454840	460400	What happened was the intellectual communists were sent out in cadres, out into these little
460400	464460	towns to find people who would help them round up the kulaks.
464460	467520	So imagine you're in a town and there's three or four people or maybe ten people or
467520	470200	something like that who are a little more successful than everyone else.
470200	473760	There's going to be some people who are not happy about it at all, that are going
473760	476260	to be very resentful about that and jealous.
476260	480620	And so when the intellectuals came in and described the reason that these people should
480620	485760	be treated as parasites and profiteers, then it was the resentful minority in those towns,
485760	488960	and that would be the kind of guy that hangs around in the bar all the time and is completely
488960	493740	unconscious and fails at everything and then blames everyone else for it.
493740	498680	The intellectuals came in and said, here's, this is unfair that this happened to you.
498680	502720	You've actually been victimized and now it's your opportunity to go have your revenge.
502720	506680	It's not hard to find people who are cruel for the sake of being cruel and who have told
506680	510640	themselves that it's because their politics are good and their targets are bad that justifies
510640	511640	that cruelty.
511640	515740	This makes the cruelty moral, and I say that word moral with heavy air quotes.
515740	519600	This ranges from people playing cover for thieves, looters, and shoplifters, saying
519600	523240	shit like, don't snitch on a thief stealing from a corporation, you didn't see nothing.
523240	527520	Or idiotically calling people racist for noticing the California ransacking problem, to people
527520	531420	playing cover for rioters and arsonists who destroy people's businesses and livelihoods
531420	533660	by saying, oh, that's what insurance is for, lol.
533660	536300	At least that's what they said during the George Floyd riots.
536300	540540	Now that it's a gay bar getting arson instead, people are screaming about how insurance isn't
540540	541540	enough.
541540	542700	It's funny how that fucking works.
542700	546300	To people openly advocating for the death of their political opponents and the targets
546300	550940	of their ire, and in some cases actually killing them, again, viewing your enemies as ontologically
550940	551940	evil.
551940	555460	I also made a video on this topic as well, quite literally called the identification
555460	559700	with evil, where I described the left's tendencies to claim as their heroes the worst fictional
559700	564100	characters possible, because those characters in rejecting the status quo were subversive.
564100	566100	The fact that they were evil didn't actually matter.
566100	569500	The video revolved around the new guy meme, where the creator of that comic's moral compass
569500	573620	was so twisted that she actually thought people were going to identify with her self-insert
573620	577180	character, who was cruel and bitter, as opposed to the new guy who genuinely seemed to have
577180	581740	a decency about him, solely because she viewed her politics as being correct.
581740	585220	The issue here, ultimately, is that these people think that a correct politics actually
585220	589660	exists, and that of course, they have the vision of the perfect politics all the time.
589660	593900	Then they're comparing themselves, their behaviours, and their lives to that perfection, constantly
593900	597720	falling short of it and becoming embittered by it, rather than doing what most sane and
597720	601600	normal humans do, which is comparing yourself to who you were yesterday, rather than some
601600	606460	ideal perfect future, and spending your time and energy working on incremental change.
606460	610140	This bitterness seems to be connected to a more general trend among millennials, which
610140	612220	is steeped in cynicism and disappointment.
612220	615660	They thought their lives would turn out differently, and rather than doing what they can, where
615660	619560	they are with what they've got, they'd rather rage at everything around them and be cruel
619560	621740	and drive away what little hope that remains.
621740	626120	Level 4, where the socialist hates his own family because they, too, are bourgeois oppressors
626120	629680	for properly working within the system, gaining and having capital, and expecting them to
629680	646520	get a fucking job now that they're of age, it's not hard to find terminally online communists
646520	648500	with failed relationships with their families.
648500	652800	In fact, again, I did a video on this topic, too, about how young people tend to hate their
652800	656460	conservative parents, conservative small towns, and conservative upbringings, and after high
656460	659700	school they move to cities and universities to further radicalize.
659700	663400	They constantly say and think, once these old people are dead, we'll be able to outvote
663400	665660	the rest and finally build the socialist utopia.
665660	670120	I should know, when I was a 19 year old socialist, it's exactly what I said and thought, too.
670120	672760	A lot of these people come from extremely privileged backgrounds.
672760	676020	Zoe Quinn, of Gamergate fame, came from the Van Valkenburg family.
676020	680220	Her boyfriend during Gamergate was Alex Lifshitz, who hated his father while simultaneously
680220	682040	living on his military contractor money.
682040	685900	Vosch grew up in Beverly Hills, and his father has an extensive career working in Hollywood.
685900	689740	Hassan Peiker got to where he is because of opportunities given to him by his uncle, Cenk
689740	693700	Uygur, at the Young Turks, and he hit mainstream news for buying a Hollywood mansion.
693700	697220	Even someone smaller like Kefls, the trans woman surrounding the recent Destiny drama
697220	701660	– yes, her time is coming on this channel – calls herself working class, but her parents
701660	705860	had the money to spring for her trips to South Korea and Thailand for expensive transitioning
705860	706860	surgeries.
706860	710540	Seriously, gather up all the progs and commies, put their picks on a dartboard, and throw.
710540	713700	Whomever you hit, you will discover that they were people born with privilege.
713700	716540	Level 5 is what Jordan Peterson talked about at the beginning.
716540	718780	Hatred of being itself, and I get it.
718780	719780	Being is hard.
719780	720780	It's suffering.
720780	721780	There's work involved.
721780	722780	You're going to die.
722780	724140	Everybody you know and love will also die.
724140	725420	Everything you build will fail.
725420	728740	Every accomplishment you achieve will be undone, and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
728740	732900	If you're very lucky, in 100 years time, the sum total of your life – all of the
732900	737140	ups and downs, all of the stages of development, all of the memories, all of the accomplishments,
737140	741180	all of the relationships, all of the experiences – will be reduced to nothing more than a
741180	744220	single inaccurate story that your descendants will tell each other.
744220	747500	And when those descendants die, it will be like you never even existed.
747500	748860	The void waits for us all.
748860	752300	I think I deeply understand the people who have a hatred of being.
752300	755140	And I think that is what's at the bottom of all of this.
755140	757540	Revenge against the universe for having brought you into it.
757540	760060	You didn't consent to bear the burden that is the suffering of life.
760220	761220	It's not fair.
761220	764980	And that's why school shooters do what they do, rather than simply offing themselves quietly
764980	766820	since they want to die so badly.
766820	770140	Because somebody has to be punished for that crime, and God's out of reach.
770140	772700	So why not the people at school that made their lives a living hell?
772700	777680	That's why every totalitarian regime, regardless of political slant, destroys whole populations
777680	779540	and moralizes about doing so.
779540	781020	How this is for the greater good.
781020	783740	Here's what's, in my opinion, Huxley's greatest quote.
783740	788500	The surest way to work up a crusade in favor of some good cause is to promise people they
788500	790700	will have the chance of maltreating someone.
790700	792760	To be able to destroy with a good conscience.
792760	796820	To be able to behave badly and call your bad behavior righteous indignation.
796820	798740	That is the height of psychological luxury.
798740	800620	The most delicious of moral treats.
800620	803800	Again, viewing your enemies as ontologically evil.
803800	806380	It's not hard to find people who exist at this level.
806380	808880	Who blindly hate based only on ideology.
808880	813000	Who advocate for widespread death, like all other tyrants before them, in the name of
813000	814000	a greater good.
814000	818220	Who curse at the victims that they create, because their existence is politically inconvenient.
818220	823100	And though I have no examples to put on screen this time, I have met and seen many depressed
823100	828000	leftists say things like, widespread mental health problems are caused by capitalism.
828000	830900	And I never asked to be born, I hate that I have to work to eat.
830900	832180	These are the laws of nature.
832180	835260	You will always have to work to live, regardless of social change.
835260	839860	Mental health problems are not caused by capitalism, but by your own cynicism about your inability
839860	841880	to achieve the perfection you're addicted to.
841880	844400	This attitude is the hatred of being itself.
844400	846940	And all of this shit is endemic to socialism.
846940	851340	Karl Marx himself would be right at home beside the blue-haired, plaid-wearing, verified
851340	855140	Twitter hipster who hates his job and hates his parents and hates his life.
855140	857560	We all know one of the more famous Marx quotes.
857560	858700	Religion is the opium of the masses.
858700	859900	Here's the full quote.
859900	863460	Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul
863460	864580	of soulless conditions.
864580	866180	It is the opium of the people.
866180	870100	The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is to demand for their
870100	871180	real happiness.
871180	874400	To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to
874400	876600	give up a condition that requires illusions.
876600	881180	The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that veil of tears
881180	883040	of which religion is the halo.
883040	886980	Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain, not in order that man shall
886980	891000	continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw
891000	893600	off the chain and pluck the living flower.
893600	897940	Criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality
897940	901760	like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move
901760	904320	around himself as his own true son.
904320	907940	These are the words of a man who is eternally at war with reality itself.
907940	910860	This is the cry of rage and his inability to reach perfection.
910860	914860	To really hammer the point home, I want to show you some letters to Karl Marx from Heinrich
914860	915980	Marx, his father.
915980	920600	Dear old dad's words about his son give us some insight into what kind of man Marx was.
920600	924420	Frankly speaking, my dear Karl, I do not like this modern world, which all weaklings use
924420	927700	to cloak their feelings when they quarrel with the world because they do not possess,
927700	932520	without labor or trouble, well-furnished palaces with vast sums of money and elegant carriages.
932520	936220	This embitterment disgusts me, and you are the last person from whom I would expect it.
936220	937560	What grounds can you have for it?
937560	939960	Has not everything smiled on you ever since your cradle?
939960	942360	Has not nature endowed you with magnificent talents?
942360	944360	Have your parents not lavished affection on you?
944360	947520	Have you ever up to now been unable to satisfy your reasonable wishes?
947520	951060	And have you not carried away in the most incomprehensible fashion the heart of a girl
951060	952740	whom thousands envy you?
952740	956540	Yet the first untoward event, the first disappointed wish, invokes embitterment.
956540	957540	Is that strength?
957540	959100	Is that a manly character?
959100	961060	This criticism isn't a one-off either.
961060	964460	On several occasions we were without a letter for months, and the last time when you knew
964460	968760	Edward was ill, Mother suffering, and I myself not well, and moreover cholera was raging
968760	969760	in Berlin.
969760	973320	And as if that did not even call for an apology, your next letter contained not a single word
973320	977640	about it, but merely some badly written lines and an extract from the diary entitled The
977640	981540	Visit, which I would quite frankly prefer to throw out rather than accept, a crazy botch
981540	985660	work which merely testifies how you squander your talents and spend your nights giving
985660	989840	birth to monsters, that you follow in the footsteps of the new immoralists who twist
989840	993640	their words until they themselves do not hear them, who christen a flood of words a
993640	998040	product of genius because it is devoid of ideas or contains only distorted ideas.
998040	1003240	As if we were men of wealth, my son disposed in one year of almost seven hundred tailors,
1003240	1006920	contrary to all agreement, contrary to all usage, whereas the richest spend less than
1006920	1007920	five hundred.
1007920	1008920	And why?
1008920	1011880	I do him the justice of saying that he is no rake, no squanderer, but how can a man
1011880	1016880	who every week or two discovers a new system and has to tear up old works laboriously arrived
1016880	1019320	at, how can he, I ask, worry about trifles?
1019320	1021440	How can he submit to the pettiness of order?
1021440	1024540	Everyone dips a hand in his pocket, and everyone cheats him, so long as he doesn't disturb
1024540	1025540	him in his studies.
1025540	1028280	And a new money order is soon written again, of course.
1028280	1031040	I must add, too, the complaints of your brothers and sisters.
1031040	1034000	From your letters, one can hardly see that you have any brothers or sisters.
1034000	1037240	As for the good Sophie, who has suffered so much for you, and Jenny is so lavish in her
1037240	1040240	devotion to you, you do not think of her when you do not need her.
1040240	1042960	I have paid your money order for one hundred and sixty tailors.
1042960	1046880	I cannot or can hardly charge it to the old academic year, for that truly has its full
1046880	1047880	due.
1047880	1050280	And for the future I do not want to expect many of the same kind.
1050280	1053880	Oh, by the way, that request from Marx to stop spending so much money went unheeded,
1053880	1055720	as we can tell from a third letter.
1055720	1059520	I am referring to the paltry matter of money, the value of which for the father of a family
1059520	1061000	you still do not seem to recognize.
1061000	1062000	But I do all the more.
1062000	1066040	I do not deny that at times I reproach myself with having left you all too loose a reign
1066040	1067040	in this respect.
1067040	1071080	Thus we are now in the fourth month of the law year, and you have already drawn two hundred
1071080	1072200	and eighty tailors.
1072200	1074440	I have not yet earned that much this winter.
1074440	1077880	I am sorry for that gigantic block of text, but I really wanted to hammer the point home.
1077880	1081480	Marx was considered to be brilliant, but also depressive, manipulative, potentially even
1081480	1082480	sociopathic.
1082480	1085400	He treated his parents like a bank account, he only considered his family insofar as he
1085400	1086400	could use them.
1086400	1090460	His father was dismayed at who Marx was becoming, despite his talents and his upbringing.
1090460	1094600	And as an adult, Marx went to war with being itself, and every other socialist follows
1094600	1095960	in his footsteps.
1095960	1099880	So when Jordan Peterson says that the bottom of all of this is punishment against God for
1099880	1102600	the crime of being, if you are looking at that viral clip and thinking that it is just
1102600	1105360	more bible mumbo jumbo, you are not actually paying attention.
1105360	1108600	I have said it before, I am an atheist, I don't care about the God part of this conversation,
1108600	1112520	but it is overwhelmingly clear to me that in a non-religious sense, Peterson is absolutely
1112520	1113520	right.
1113520	1116800	The bitterness and hatred and cruelty that drives a person to destroy those who are doing
1116800	1120120	better than him because he cannot stand the sight of himself in the mirror every morning,
1120120	1123600	since whenever he looks into it he sees a failure and he can't bear to take responsibility
1123600	1126760	for that failure, so he is desperate to offload it onto anything else he can.
1126760	1129020	If that's the rich, fine, if that's the system, so much the better.
1129020	1133060	That feeling, those people, they're real, socialism thrives on people like this.
1133060	1136940	A lot of those replies to the viral clip from the beginning came from people genuinely too
1136940	1140620	dumb to understand what's going on, but I have a hunch that a lot of them also came
1140620	1144460	from people who know, deep down, that what Jordan Peterson is describing and what I've
1144460	1148200	described here, that that's you, that you're the bitter, hateful, cruel person who would
1148200	1151580	rather punish God for the crime of being than actually do something positive and work to
1151580	1152580	build up their life.
1152580	1156660	You terminally online dumbfucks are addicted to reading Twitter trending headlines 16 hours
1156660	1160420	a day because social media makes the socialist movement look bigger than it actually is.
1160420	1163660	You can get into your bubble and circlejerk about the impending revolution all day long,
1163660	1166780	I know your communities feel big because there's a lot of tweets and retweets, but in the real
1166780	1169660	world nobody actually likes you, they'll never meet a single person in real life who
1169660	1171760	gives anywhere near as much of a fuck as you do about it.
1171760	1175480	The few real friends you do actually have all think you're neurotic as fuck for obsessing
1175480	1179700	over Catalonia or Zapatista or Rojava, nobody knows what the weird fucking flags hanging
1179700	1183300	in your room are, your favorite breadtuber doesn't know your parasocial ass exists,
1183300	1187220	your weird anarcho-syndicalist with South American characteristic streams get less views
1187220	1190700	than my fucking gaming channel, you will never accomplish any of your political goals, and
1190700	1194680	if you don't fucking stop and log off, you are going to spend the rest of your life wasting
1194680	1197140	away online accomplishing nothing but ratios on Twitter.
