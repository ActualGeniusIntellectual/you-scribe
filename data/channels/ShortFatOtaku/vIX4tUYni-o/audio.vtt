00:00.000 --> 00:07.700
Oh boy, is this becoming the Jordan Peterson channel?

00:07.700 --> 00:10.520
Because this is like the third video in a row that relies on one of his quotes to start

00:10.520 --> 00:11.520
a conversation.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.600
While I do like Jordan Peterson to a point, I also recognize that when he gets out of

00:14.600 --> 00:17.280
his psychology wheelhouse, he's honestly a little bit shaky.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.080
The psych stuff is 100% on point, but his career shifted away from psychology to being

00:21.080 --> 00:25.040
a pop scientist years ago, and his non-psych takes are hit and miss.

00:25.040 --> 00:28.540
But nonetheless, there's a few clips from his recent Andy Ngo video that have gone viral,

00:28.540 --> 00:32.380
and one specific clip that the left has decided to repost and mock everywhere.

00:32.380 --> 00:35.220
So I would like to analyze it, because I think it actually contains some wisdom.

00:35.220 --> 00:39.740
What is the psychology of this mob violence?

00:39.740 --> 00:47.980
When I see it, like I don't even recognize some of these, they seem animalistic is what

00:47.980 --> 00:48.980
I mean.

00:48.980 --> 00:52.500
No, they're worse than animals.

00:52.500 --> 00:56.460
They're worse than animals, because animals, they just kill to eat, you know?

00:56.460 --> 00:59.940
Human beings, they have a twist in them that makes them far worse than animals when they

00:59.940 --> 01:00.940
really get going.

01:00.940 --> 01:04.300
Well, I think it's, I think, you really want to know what I think?

01:04.300 --> 01:09.820
I think it's revenge against God for the crime of being.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.400
That's really what I think.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.860
It's Cain and Cain and Abel.

01:14.860 --> 01:17.340
It's like, oh, Abel's your, Abel's your guy, eh, God?

01:17.340 --> 01:20.780
How about if I take him out in the field and beat him to death?

01:20.780 --> 01:22.500
How do you feel about that?

01:22.500 --> 01:26.820
All my sacrifices went unrewarded.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.060
Now that actually does sound a bit too dramatic.

01:30.060 --> 01:33.860
And boy, did Twitter not hesitate to point out exactly how dramatic it sounds.

01:33.860 --> 01:37.900
I'll let these reactions scroll by on the screen while we talk about this.

01:37.900 --> 01:42.380
Feel free to pause at any time and read these in detail, because this clip has like 3,000

01:42.380 --> 01:46.280
quote tweets, and the vast majority of them are terminally online leftist activists with

01:46.280 --> 01:49.900
pit crew avatars, flags and emojis representing their support of the current thing in their

01:49.900 --> 01:54.500
name and comments that don't actually count as anything even resembling a real analysis.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.180
Just making fun of the man because they don't like him.

01:56.180 --> 01:59.980
And they find the idea that the foundation upon which their violent socialist activism

01:59.980 --> 02:01.920
sits is a hatred of life itself.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.820
How can that be, they say, or for the working class after all?

02:04.820 --> 02:08.180
We want to ameliorate the material conditions of everybody.

02:08.180 --> 02:09.180
We want freedom.

02:09.180 --> 02:13.120
We want good ends and harm reduction and equality and every other buzzword you can think of

02:13.120 --> 02:16.820
that the left likes to label itself with in an effort to claim the moral high ground.

02:16.820 --> 02:21.060
But as Peterson said in that same interview, it's not any sort of moral high ground that

02:21.060 --> 02:46.440
causes them to laugh at suffering.

02:46.440 --> 03:00.480
Rather, it's that they've convinced themselves that their cause is so righteous that anybody

03:00.480 --> 03:04.420
who opposes them must be ontologically evil by default, and they can do what they will

03:04.420 --> 03:05.420
with them.

03:05.420 --> 03:06.420
Or at least that's the reason they tell themselves.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.820
No really, that's actually the text of a common meme right now that they love to use.

03:09.820 --> 03:13.560
It's fitting that they chose Patrick Bateman, the American Psycho himself, as the pitcher

03:13.560 --> 03:14.560
for that one.

03:14.560 --> 03:18.680
Let's actually examine this idea, that the radical left is rebelling against God for

03:18.680 --> 03:19.680
the crime of being.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.320
We can take God out of it, frankly.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.480
The analysis is the same.

03:22.480 --> 03:26.200
There's multiple levels to go down until we reach the bottom, so let's start digging.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.280
Level 1, where the socialist is simply self-interested.

03:44.560 --> 03:50.920
Oh, have I used that clip too much recently?

03:50.920 --> 04:06.960
Okay, how about this one instead?

04:06.960 --> 04:11.180
It's not hard to find some conservative YouTube channel, like Crowder's Change My Mind thing

04:11.180 --> 04:15.180
or Campus Reform, where the host interviews some dipshit university students and gets

04:15.180 --> 04:18.420
them to admit the most basic hypocrisies about their socialist ideals.

04:18.420 --> 04:23.040
The example on screen is about a GPA redistribution, where the left-leaning students are asked

04:23.040 --> 04:27.700
why shouldn't we equalize the GPA of high-achieving students with low-achieving ones?

04:27.700 --> 04:30.880
The students all give the same reply, because the low-achieving ones didn't work as hard

04:30.880 --> 04:31.880
as they did.

04:31.880 --> 04:35.980
When confronted with the very real possibility that high earners and low earners in society

04:35.980 --> 04:40.860
function the same way, making income redistribution just as offensive as GPA distribution is,

04:40.860 --> 04:42.740
almost all of their brains shut down.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.340
This is a funny gotcha moment, sure, but it serves to show that a lot of young socialists

04:46.340 --> 04:50.020
are either idiots who haven't thought enough about their ideas, or they're entirely unprincipled

04:50.020 --> 04:52.700
and simply looking to do what benefits them.

04:52.700 --> 04:55.260
Redistribution when they're on the bottom, rugged individualism when they're on the top.

04:55.260 --> 04:56.900
Frankly, it's probably a bit of both.

04:56.900 --> 05:00.900
Level 2, where the socialist directly sides with a foreign evil, because at least it is

05:00.900 --> 05:01.900
not the familiar.

05:01.900 --> 05:06.900
During the Vietnam War, we were actually the very first party in the US to stage a demonstration

05:06.900 --> 05:11.380
against the Vietnam War, in like 1968, when most people just kind of thought the war was

05:11.380 --> 05:14.380
whatever, you know, there wasn't a massive anti-war movement.

05:14.380 --> 05:19.660
And I think, you know, obviously the Vietnamese people themselves fought a heroic battle and

05:19.660 --> 05:21.960
gained their liberation from US imperialism.

05:21.960 --> 05:25.540
It's not hard to find people on the left who worship the genocidal totalitarian regimes

05:25.540 --> 05:26.820
of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao.

05:26.820 --> 05:30.260
And I don't just mean the overt tankies, though obviously them.

05:30.260 --> 05:34.340
Even the breadtubers, the so-called libertarian socialists, while they might criticize the

05:34.340 --> 05:38.220
Soviet regime from time to time, especially during a debate with a non-socialist, where

05:38.220 --> 05:41.980
they know that an audience outside of their own insular crowd might be watching, catch

05:41.980 --> 05:47.220
them talking on their own, to their own communities, and you'll likely hear some variant of, well,

05:47.220 --> 05:51.180
socialist regimes around the world were sabotaged by capitalists who refused to trade with them.

05:51.180 --> 05:55.380
Because I guess socialism requires an outside capitalist society to keep trading with them,

05:55.380 --> 05:56.700
if it's going to work?

05:56.700 --> 06:00.740
Modern socialist apologia ranges from the Hall of D'Amour was an accident, not a genocide,

06:00.740 --> 06:05.420
to the kulaks deserved it for resisting collectivization, actually, to the exceptionally grotesque the

06:05.420 --> 06:10.380
Communist Party of Peru did not boil children alive, but they did occasionally use scalding

06:10.380 --> 06:14.180
water as a method of execution, which has to be the craziest commie simping I've seen

06:14.180 --> 06:15.180
yet.

06:15.180 --> 06:18.300
I made a video detailing this general idea in the past, revolving around this quote of

06:18.300 --> 06:19.300
Aristotle's.

06:19.300 --> 06:23.580
It is the mark of a tyrant to have men of foreign extraction rather than citizens as

06:23.580 --> 06:27.760
guests at table and companions, feeling that citizens are hostile but strangers make no

06:27.760 --> 06:28.760
claim against him.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.840
I probably didn't do that video concept proper justice back then, but hey, we all

06:31.840 --> 06:32.840
get better over time.

06:32.840 --> 06:37.720
And while before I used the example of leftists loving immigrants as oddities from a foreign

06:37.720 --> 06:40.640
land while hating their own countrymen, I'll look at it from a different angle this time.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.960
Have you ever noticed that if you happen to know a couple where one partner is secretly

06:43.960 --> 06:47.280
abusive of the other, when you think about your interactions with them, you will begin

06:47.280 --> 06:48.360
to notice a pattern?

06:48.360 --> 06:52.060
More specifically, that the abusive person while at a social event with their partner

06:52.060 --> 06:56.580
is not only quick to brush off their partner's complaints, but also gracious with outsiders

06:56.580 --> 06:58.540
and heavily invested in keeping the peace.

06:58.540 --> 07:00.020
There's a limit to this, of course.

07:00.020 --> 07:03.700
There are extraordinary stories where the abuser snaps publicly, but you know what I

07:03.700 --> 07:04.700
mean.

07:04.700 --> 07:05.700
There's two reasons for this.

07:05.700 --> 07:09.620
One, it's because the abusive dynamic is a product of the relationship and the abuser

07:09.620 --> 07:11.980
feels that outsiders should not be privy to it.

07:11.980 --> 07:16.140
Two, it's because the outsiders do not know the abuser in that way and so they cannot

07:16.140 --> 07:18.140
peer into the darker parts of his soul.

07:18.140 --> 07:22.300
This is all just guesswork by me, but that idea maps onto Aristotle's view of tyrants

07:22.300 --> 07:26.160
well, and it also maps onto the socialist who is willing to support the evil other over

07:26.160 --> 07:27.680
his own familiar homeland.

07:27.680 --> 07:31.740
Level three, where the socialist directly sides with domestic evil, because a socialist

07:31.740 --> 07:34.840
revolution must come from the margins of society.

07:34.840 --> 07:40.400
What happened was the intellectual communists were sent out in cadres, out into these little

07:40.400 --> 07:44.460
towns to find people who would help them round up the kulaks.

07:44.460 --> 07:47.520
So imagine you're in a town and there's three or four people or maybe ten people or

07:47.520 --> 07:50.200
something like that who are a little more successful than everyone else.

07:50.200 --> 07:53.760
There's going to be some people who are not happy about it at all, that are going

07:53.760 --> 07:56.260
to be very resentful about that and jealous.

07:56.260 --> 08:00.620
And so when the intellectuals came in and described the reason that these people should

08:00.620 --> 08:05.760
be treated as parasites and profiteers, then it was the resentful minority in those towns,

08:05.760 --> 08:08.960
and that would be the kind of guy that hangs around in the bar all the time and is completely

08:08.960 --> 08:13.740
unconscious and fails at everything and then blames everyone else for it.

08:13.740 --> 08:18.680
The intellectuals came in and said, here's, this is unfair that this happened to you.

08:18.680 --> 08:22.720
You've actually been victimized and now it's your opportunity to go have your revenge.

08:22.720 --> 08:26.680
It's not hard to find people who are cruel for the sake of being cruel and who have told

08:26.680 --> 08:30.640
themselves that it's because their politics are good and their targets are bad that justifies

08:30.640 --> 08:31.640
that cruelty.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.740
This makes the cruelty moral, and I say that word moral with heavy air quotes.

08:35.740 --> 08:39.600
This ranges from people playing cover for thieves, looters, and shoplifters, saying

08:39.600 --> 08:43.240
shit like, don't snitch on a thief stealing from a corporation, you didn't see nothing.

08:43.240 --> 08:47.520
Or idiotically calling people racist for noticing the California ransacking problem, to people

08:47.520 --> 08:51.420
playing cover for rioters and arsonists who destroy people's businesses and livelihoods

08:51.420 --> 08:53.660
by saying, oh, that's what insurance is for, lol.

08:53.660 --> 08:56.300
At least that's what they said during the George Floyd riots.

08:56.300 --> 09:00.540
Now that it's a gay bar getting arson instead, people are screaming about how insurance isn't

09:00.540 --> 09:01.540
enough.

09:01.540 --> 09:02.700
It's funny how that fucking works.

09:02.700 --> 09:06.300
To people openly advocating for the death of their political opponents and the targets

09:06.300 --> 09:10.940
of their ire, and in some cases actually killing them, again, viewing your enemies as ontologically

09:10.940 --> 09:11.940
evil.

09:11.940 --> 09:15.460
I also made a video on this topic as well, quite literally called the identification

09:15.460 --> 09:19.700
with evil, where I described the left's tendencies to claim as their heroes the worst fictional

09:19.700 --> 09:24.100
characters possible, because those characters in rejecting the status quo were subversive.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.100
The fact that they were evil didn't actually matter.

09:26.100 --> 09:29.500
The video revolved around the new guy meme, where the creator of that comic's moral compass

09:29.500 --> 09:33.620
was so twisted that she actually thought people were going to identify with her self-insert

09:33.620 --> 09:37.180
character, who was cruel and bitter, as opposed to the new guy who genuinely seemed to have

09:37.180 --> 09:41.740
a decency about him, solely because she viewed her politics as being correct.

09:41.740 --> 09:45.220
The issue here, ultimately, is that these people think that a correct politics actually

09:45.220 --> 09:49.660
exists, and that of course, they have the vision of the perfect politics all the time.

09:49.660 --> 09:53.900
Then they're comparing themselves, their behaviours, and their lives to that perfection, constantly

09:53.900 --> 09:57.720
falling short of it and becoming embittered by it, rather than doing what most sane and

09:57.720 --> 10:01.600
normal humans do, which is comparing yourself to who you were yesterday, rather than some

10:01.600 --> 10:06.460
ideal perfect future, and spending your time and energy working on incremental change.

10:06.460 --> 10:10.140
This bitterness seems to be connected to a more general trend among millennials, which

10:10.140 --> 10:12.220
is steeped in cynicism and disappointment.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.660
They thought their lives would turn out differently, and rather than doing what they can, where

10:15.660 --> 10:19.560
they are with what they've got, they'd rather rage at everything around them and be cruel

10:19.560 --> 10:21.740
and drive away what little hope that remains.

10:21.740 --> 10:26.120
Level 4, where the socialist hates his own family because they, too, are bourgeois oppressors

10:26.120 --> 10:29.680
for properly working within the system, gaining and having capital, and expecting them to

10:29.680 --> 10:46.520
get a fucking job now that they're of age, it's not hard to find terminally online communists

10:46.520 --> 10:48.500
with failed relationships with their families.

10:48.500 --> 10:52.800
In fact, again, I did a video on this topic, too, about how young people tend to hate their

10:52.800 --> 10:56.460
conservative parents, conservative small towns, and conservative upbringings, and after high

10:56.460 --> 10:59.700
school they move to cities and universities to further radicalize.

10:59.700 --> 11:03.400
They constantly say and think, once these old people are dead, we'll be able to outvote

11:03.400 --> 11:05.660
the rest and finally build the socialist utopia.

11:05.660 --> 11:10.120
I should know, when I was a 19 year old socialist, it's exactly what I said and thought, too.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.760
A lot of these people come from extremely privileged backgrounds.

11:12.760 --> 11:16.020
Zoe Quinn, of Gamergate fame, came from the Van Valkenburg family.

11:16.020 --> 11:20.220
Her boyfriend during Gamergate was Alex Lifshitz, who hated his father while simultaneously

11:20.220 --> 11:22.040
living on his military contractor money.

11:22.040 --> 11:25.900
Vosch grew up in Beverly Hills, and his father has an extensive career working in Hollywood.

11:25.900 --> 11:29.740
Hassan Peiker got to where he is because of opportunities given to him by his uncle, Cenk

11:29.740 --> 11:33.700
Uygur, at the Young Turks, and he hit mainstream news for buying a Hollywood mansion.

11:33.700 --> 11:37.220
Even someone smaller like Kefls, the trans woman surrounding the recent Destiny drama

11:37.220 --> 11:41.660
– yes, her time is coming on this channel – calls herself working class, but her parents

11:41.660 --> 11:45.860
had the money to spring for her trips to South Korea and Thailand for expensive transitioning

11:45.860 --> 11:46.860
surgeries.

11:46.860 --> 11:50.540
Seriously, gather up all the progs and commies, put their picks on a dartboard, and throw.

11:50.540 --> 11:53.700
Whomever you hit, you will discover that they were people born with privilege.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.540
Level 5 is what Jordan Peterson talked about at the beginning.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.780
Hatred of being itself, and I get it.

11:58.780 --> 11:59.780
Being is hard.

11:59.780 --> 12:00.780
It's suffering.

12:00.780 --> 12:01.780
There's work involved.

12:01.780 --> 12:02.780
You're going to die.

12:02.780 --> 12:04.140
Everybody you know and love will also die.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.420
Everything you build will fail.

12:05.420 --> 12:08.740
Every accomplishment you achieve will be undone, and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

12:08.740 --> 12:12.900
If you're very lucky, in 100 years time, the sum total of your life – all of the

12:12.900 --> 12:17.140
ups and downs, all of the stages of development, all of the memories, all of the accomplishments,

12:17.140 --> 12:21.180
all of the relationships, all of the experiences – will be reduced to nothing more than a

12:21.180 --> 12:24.220
single inaccurate story that your descendants will tell each other.

12:24.220 --> 12:27.500
And when those descendants die, it will be like you never even existed.

12:27.500 --> 12:28.860
The void waits for us all.

12:28.860 --> 12:32.300
I think I deeply understand the people who have a hatred of being.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.140
And I think that is what's at the bottom of all of this.

12:35.140 --> 12:37.540
Revenge against the universe for having brought you into it.

12:37.540 --> 12:40.060
You didn't consent to bear the burden that is the suffering of life.

12:40.220 --> 12:41.220
It's not fair.

12:41.220 --> 12:44.980
And that's why school shooters do what they do, rather than simply offing themselves quietly

12:44.980 --> 12:46.820
since they want to die so badly.

12:46.820 --> 12:50.140
Because somebody has to be punished for that crime, and God's out of reach.

12:50.140 --> 12:52.700
So why not the people at school that made their lives a living hell?

12:52.700 --> 12:57.680
That's why every totalitarian regime, regardless of political slant, destroys whole populations

12:57.680 --> 12:59.540
and moralizes about doing so.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.020
How this is for the greater good.

13:01.020 --> 13:03.740
Here's what's, in my opinion, Huxley's greatest quote.

13:03.740 --> 13:08.500
The surest way to work up a crusade in favor of some good cause is to promise people they

13:08.500 --> 13:10.700
will have the chance of maltreating someone.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.760
To be able to destroy with a good conscience.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.820
To be able to behave badly and call your bad behavior righteous indignation.

13:16.820 --> 13:18.740
That is the height of psychological luxury.

13:18.740 --> 13:20.620
The most delicious of moral treats.

13:20.620 --> 13:23.800
Again, viewing your enemies as ontologically evil.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.380
It's not hard to find people who exist at this level.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.880
Who blindly hate based only on ideology.

13:28.880 --> 13:33.000
Who advocate for widespread death, like all other tyrants before them, in the name of

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
a greater good.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.220
Who curse at the victims that they create, because their existence is politically inconvenient.

13:38.220 --> 13:43.100
And though I have no examples to put on screen this time, I have met and seen many depressed

13:43.100 --> 13:48.000
leftists say things like, widespread mental health problems are caused by capitalism.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.900
And I never asked to be born, I hate that I have to work to eat.

13:50.900 --> 13:52.180
These are the laws of nature.

13:52.180 --> 13:55.260
You will always have to work to live, regardless of social change.

13:55.260 --> 13:59.860
Mental health problems are not caused by capitalism, but by your own cynicism about your inability

13:59.860 --> 14:01.880
to achieve the perfection you're addicted to.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.400
This attitude is the hatred of being itself.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.940
And all of this shit is endemic to socialism.

14:06.940 --> 14:11.340
Karl Marx himself would be right at home beside the blue-haired, plaid-wearing, verified

14:11.340 --> 14:15.140
Twitter hipster who hates his job and hates his parents and hates his life.

14:15.140 --> 14:17.560
We all know one of the more famous Marx quotes.

14:17.560 --> 14:18.700
Religion is the opium of the masses.

14:18.700 --> 14:19.900
Here's the full quote.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.460
Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul

14:23.460 --> 14:24.580
of soulless conditions.

14:24.580 --> 14:26.180
It is the opium of the people.

14:26.180 --> 14:30.100
The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is to demand for their

14:30.100 --> 14:31.180
real happiness.

14:31.180 --> 14:34.400
To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to

14:34.400 --> 14:36.600
give up a condition that requires illusions.

14:36.600 --> 14:41.180
The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that veil of tears

14:41.180 --> 14:43.040
of which religion is the halo.

14:43.040 --> 14:46.980
Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain, not in order that man shall

14:46.980 --> 14:51.000
continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw

14:51.000 --> 14:53.600
off the chain and pluck the living flower.

14:53.600 --> 14:57.940
Criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality

14:57.940 --> 15:01.760
like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move

15:01.760 --> 15:04.320
around himself as his own true son.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.940
These are the words of a man who is eternally at war with reality itself.

15:07.940 --> 15:10.860
This is the cry of rage and his inability to reach perfection.

15:10.860 --> 15:14.860
To really hammer the point home, I want to show you some letters to Karl Marx from Heinrich

15:14.860 --> 15:15.980
Marx, his father.

15:15.980 --> 15:20.600
Dear old dad's words about his son give us some insight into what kind of man Marx was.

15:20.600 --> 15:24.420
Frankly speaking, my dear Karl, I do not like this modern world, which all weaklings use

15:24.420 --> 15:27.700
to cloak their feelings when they quarrel with the world because they do not possess,

15:27.700 --> 15:32.520
without labor or trouble, well-furnished palaces with vast sums of money and elegant carriages.

15:32.520 --> 15:36.220
This embitterment disgusts me, and you are the last person from whom I would expect it.

15:36.220 --> 15:37.560
What grounds can you have for it?

15:37.560 --> 15:39.960
Has not everything smiled on you ever since your cradle?

15:39.960 --> 15:42.360
Has not nature endowed you with magnificent talents?

15:42.360 --> 15:44.360
Have your parents not lavished affection on you?

15:44.360 --> 15:47.520
Have you ever up to now been unable to satisfy your reasonable wishes?

15:47.520 --> 15:51.060
And have you not carried away in the most incomprehensible fashion the heart of a girl

15:51.060 --> 15:52.740
whom thousands envy you?

15:52.740 --> 15:56.540
Yet the first untoward event, the first disappointed wish, invokes embitterment.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.540
Is that strength?

15:57.540 --> 15:59.100
Is that a manly character?

15:59.100 --> 16:01.060
This criticism isn't a one-off either.

16:01.060 --> 16:04.460
On several occasions we were without a letter for months, and the last time when you knew

16:04.460 --> 16:08.760
Edward was ill, Mother suffering, and I myself not well, and moreover cholera was raging

16:08.760 --> 16:09.760
in Berlin.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.320
And as if that did not even call for an apology, your next letter contained not a single word

16:13.320 --> 16:17.640
about it, but merely some badly written lines and an extract from the diary entitled The

16:17.640 --> 16:21.540
Visit, which I would quite frankly prefer to throw out rather than accept, a crazy botch

16:21.540 --> 16:25.660
work which merely testifies how you squander your talents and spend your nights giving

16:25.660 --> 16:29.840
birth to monsters, that you follow in the footsteps of the new immoralists who twist

16:29.840 --> 16:33.640
their words until they themselves do not hear them, who christen a flood of words a

16:33.640 --> 16:38.040
product of genius because it is devoid of ideas or contains only distorted ideas.

16:38.040 --> 16:43.240
As if we were men of wealth, my son disposed in one year of almost seven hundred tailors,

16:43.240 --> 16:46.920
contrary to all agreement, contrary to all usage, whereas the richest spend less than

16:46.920 --> 16:47.920
five hundred.

16:47.920 --> 16:48.920
And why?

16:48.920 --> 16:51.880
I do him the justice of saying that he is no rake, no squanderer, but how can a man

16:51.880 --> 16:56.880
who every week or two discovers a new system and has to tear up old works laboriously arrived

16:56.880 --> 16:59.320
at, how can he, I ask, worry about trifles?

16:59.320 --> 17:01.440
How can he submit to the pettiness of order?

17:01.440 --> 17:04.540
Everyone dips a hand in his pocket, and everyone cheats him, so long as he doesn't disturb

17:04.540 --> 17:05.540
him in his studies.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.280
And a new money order is soon written again, of course.

17:08.280 --> 17:11.040
I must add, too, the complaints of your brothers and sisters.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.000
From your letters, one can hardly see that you have any brothers or sisters.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.240
As for the good Sophie, who has suffered so much for you, and Jenny is so lavish in her

17:17.240 --> 17:20.240
devotion to you, you do not think of her when you do not need her.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.960
I have paid your money order for one hundred and sixty tailors.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.880
I cannot or can hardly charge it to the old academic year, for that truly has its full

17:26.880 --> 17:27.880
due.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.280
And for the future I do not want to expect many of the same kind.

17:30.280 --> 17:33.880
Oh, by the way, that request from Marx to stop spending so much money went unheeded,

17:33.880 --> 17:35.720
as we can tell from a third letter.

17:35.720 --> 17:39.520
I am referring to the paltry matter of money, the value of which for the father of a family

17:39.520 --> 17:41.000
you still do not seem to recognize.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
But I do all the more.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.040
I do not deny that at times I reproach myself with having left you all too loose a reign

17:46.040 --> 17:47.040
in this respect.

17:47.040 --> 17:51.080
Thus we are now in the fourth month of the law year, and you have already drawn two hundred

17:51.080 --> 17:52.200
and eighty tailors.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.440
I have not yet earned that much this winter.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.880
I am sorry for that gigantic block of text, but I really wanted to hammer the point home.

17:57.880 --> 18:01.480
Marx was considered to be brilliant, but also depressive, manipulative, potentially even

18:01.480 --> 18:02.480
sociopathic.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.400
He treated his parents like a bank account, he only considered his family insofar as he

18:05.400 --> 18:06.400
could use them.

18:06.400 --> 18:10.460
His father was dismayed at who Marx was becoming, despite his talents and his upbringing.

18:10.460 --> 18:14.600
And as an adult, Marx went to war with being itself, and every other socialist follows

18:14.600 --> 18:15.960
in his footsteps.

18:15.960 --> 18:19.880
So when Jordan Peterson says that the bottom of all of this is punishment against God for

18:19.880 --> 18:22.600
the crime of being, if you are looking at that viral clip and thinking that it is just

18:22.600 --> 18:25.360
more bible mumbo jumbo, you are not actually paying attention.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.600
I have said it before, I am an atheist, I don't care about the God part of this conversation,

18:28.600 --> 18:32.520
but it is overwhelmingly clear to me that in a non-religious sense, Peterson is absolutely

18:32.520 --> 18:33.520
right.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.800
The bitterness and hatred and cruelty that drives a person to destroy those who are doing

18:36.800 --> 18:40.120
better than him because he cannot stand the sight of himself in the mirror every morning,

18:40.120 --> 18:43.600
since whenever he looks into it he sees a failure and he can't bear to take responsibility

18:43.600 --> 18:46.760
for that failure, so he is desperate to offload it onto anything else he can.

18:46.760 --> 18:49.020
If that's the rich, fine, if that's the system, so much the better.

18:49.020 --> 18:53.060
That feeling, those people, they're real, socialism thrives on people like this.

18:53.060 --> 18:56.940
A lot of those replies to the viral clip from the beginning came from people genuinely too

18:56.940 --> 19:00.620
dumb to understand what's going on, but I have a hunch that a lot of them also came

19:00.620 --> 19:04.460
from people who know, deep down, that what Jordan Peterson is describing and what I've

19:04.460 --> 19:08.200
described here, that that's you, that you're the bitter, hateful, cruel person who would

19:08.200 --> 19:11.580
rather punish God for the crime of being than actually do something positive and work to

19:11.580 --> 19:12.580
build up their life.

19:12.580 --> 19:16.660
You terminally online dumbfucks are addicted to reading Twitter trending headlines 16 hours

19:16.660 --> 19:20.420
a day because social media makes the socialist movement look bigger than it actually is.

19:20.420 --> 19:23.660
You can get into your bubble and circlejerk about the impending revolution all day long,

19:23.660 --> 19:26.780
I know your communities feel big because there's a lot of tweets and retweets, but in the real

19:26.780 --> 19:29.660
world nobody actually likes you, they'll never meet a single person in real life who

19:29.660 --> 19:31.760
gives anywhere near as much of a fuck as you do about it.

19:31.760 --> 19:35.480
The few real friends you do actually have all think you're neurotic as fuck for obsessing

19:35.480 --> 19:39.700
over Catalonia or Zapatista or Rojava, nobody knows what the weird fucking flags hanging

19:39.700 --> 19:43.300
in your room are, your favorite breadtuber doesn't know your parasocial ass exists,

19:43.300 --> 19:47.220
your weird anarcho-syndicalist with South American characteristic streams get less views

19:47.220 --> 19:50.700
than my fucking gaming channel, you will never accomplish any of your political goals, and

19:50.700 --> 19:54.680
if you don't fucking stop and log off, you are going to spend the rest of your life wasting

19:54.680 --> 19:57.140
away online accomplishing nothing but ratios on Twitter.
