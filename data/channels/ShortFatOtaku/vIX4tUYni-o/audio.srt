1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,700
Oh boy, is this becoming the Jordan Peterson channel?

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,520
Because this is like the third video in a row that relies on one of his quotes to start

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,520
a conversation.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,600
While I do like Jordan Peterson to a point, I also recognize that when he gets out of

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,280
his psychology wheelhouse, he's honestly a little bit shaky.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,080
The psych stuff is 100% on point, but his career shifted away from psychology to being

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,040
a pop scientist years ago, and his non-psych takes are hit and miss.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,540
But nonetheless, there's a few clips from his recent Andy Ngo video that have gone viral,

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,380
and one specific clip that the left has decided to repost and mock everywhere.

10
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,220
So I would like to analyze it, because I think it actually contains some wisdom.

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,740
What is the psychology of this mob violence?

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:47,980
When I see it, like I don't even recognize some of these, they seem animalistic is what

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,980
I mean.

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,500
No, they're worse than animals.

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,460
They're worse than animals, because animals, they just kill to eat, you know?

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,940
Human beings, they have a twist in them that makes them far worse than animals when they

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,940
really get going.

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,300
Well, I think it's, I think, you really want to know what I think?

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,820
I think it's revenge against God for the crime of being.

20
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,400
That's really what I think.

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,860
It's Cain and Cain and Abel.

22
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,340
It's like, oh, Abel's your, Abel's your guy, eh, God?

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,780
How about if I take him out in the field and beat him to death?

24
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,500
How do you feel about that?

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,820
All my sacrifices went unrewarded.

26
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,060
Now that actually does sound a bit too dramatic.

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,860
And boy, did Twitter not hesitate to point out exactly how dramatic it sounds.

28
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,900
I'll let these reactions scroll by on the screen while we talk about this.

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,380
Feel free to pause at any time and read these in detail, because this clip has like 3,000

30
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,280
quote tweets, and the vast majority of them are terminally online leftist activists with

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,900
pit crew avatars, flags and emojis representing their support of the current thing in their

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,500
name and comments that don't actually count as anything even resembling a real analysis.

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,180
Just making fun of the man because they don't like him.

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,980
And they find the idea that the foundation upon which their violent socialist activism

35
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,920
sits is a hatred of life itself.

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,820
How can that be, they say, or for the working class after all?

37
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,180
We want to ameliorate the material conditions of everybody.

38
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,180
We want freedom.

39
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,120
We want good ends and harm reduction and equality and every other buzzword you can think of

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,820
that the left likes to label itself with in an effort to claim the moral high ground.

41
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,060
But as Peterson said in that same interview, it's not any sort of moral high ground that

42
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:46,440
causes them to laugh at suffering.

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:03:00,480
Rather, it's that they've convinced themselves that their cause is so righteous that anybody

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,420
who opposes them must be ontologically evil by default, and they can do what they will

45
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,420
with them.

46
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,420
Or at least that's the reason they tell themselves.

47
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,820
No really, that's actually the text of a common meme right now that they love to use.

48
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,560
It's fitting that they chose Patrick Bateman, the American Psycho himself, as the pitcher

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
for that one.

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,680
Let's actually examine this idea, that the radical left is rebelling against God for

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
the crime of being.

52
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,320
We can take God out of it, frankly.

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,480
The analysis is the same.

54
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,200
There's multiple levels to go down until we reach the bottom, so let's start digging.

55
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,280
Level 1, where the socialist is simply self-interested.

56
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,920
Oh, have I used that clip too much recently?

57
00:03:50,920 --> 00:04:06,960
Okay, how about this one instead?

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,180
It's not hard to find some conservative YouTube channel, like Crowder's Change My Mind thing

59
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,180
or Campus Reform, where the host interviews some dipshit university students and gets

60
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,420
them to admit the most basic hypocrisies about their socialist ideals.

61
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,040
The example on screen is about a GPA redistribution, where the left-leaning students are asked

62
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,700
why shouldn't we equalize the GPA of high-achieving students with low-achieving ones?

63
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,880
The students all give the same reply, because the low-achieving ones didn't work as hard

64
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,880
as they did.

65
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,980
When confronted with the very real possibility that high earners and low earners in society

66
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,860
function the same way, making income redistribution just as offensive as GPA distribution is,

67
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,740
almost all of their brains shut down.

68
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,340
This is a funny gotcha moment, sure, but it serves to show that a lot of young socialists

69
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,020
are either idiots who haven't thought enough about their ideas, or they're entirely unprincipled

70
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,700
and simply looking to do what benefits them.

71
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,260
Redistribution when they're on the bottom, rugged individualism when they're on the top.

72
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,900
Frankly, it's probably a bit of both.

73
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,900
Level 2, where the socialist directly sides with a foreign evil, because at least it is

74
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,900
not the familiar.

75
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,900
During the Vietnam War, we were actually the very first party in the US to stage a demonstration

76
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,380
against the Vietnam War, in like 1968, when most people just kind of thought the war was

77
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,380
whatever, you know, there wasn't a massive anti-war movement.

78
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,660
And I think, you know, obviously the Vietnamese people themselves fought a heroic battle and

79
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,960
gained their liberation from US imperialism.

80
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,540
It's not hard to find people on the left who worship the genocidal totalitarian regimes

81
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,820
of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao.

82
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,260
And I don't just mean the overt tankies, though obviously them.

83
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,340
Even the breadtubers, the so-called libertarian socialists, while they might criticize the

84
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,220
Soviet regime from time to time, especially during a debate with a non-socialist, where

85
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,980
they know that an audience outside of their own insular crowd might be watching, catch

86
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,220
them talking on their own, to their own communities, and you'll likely hear some variant of, well,

87
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,180
socialist regimes around the world were sabotaged by capitalists who refused to trade with them.

88
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,380
Because I guess socialism requires an outside capitalist society to keep trading with them,

89
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,700
if it's going to work?

90
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,740
Modern socialist apologia ranges from the Hall of D'Amour was an accident, not a genocide,

91
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,420
to the kulaks deserved it for resisting collectivization, actually, to the exceptionally grotesque the

92
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,380
Communist Party of Peru did not boil children alive, but they did occasionally use scalding

93
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,180
water as a method of execution, which has to be the craziest commie simping I've seen

94
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,180
yet.

95
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,300
I made a video detailing this general idea in the past, revolving around this quote of

96
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,300
Aristotle's.

97
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,580
It is the mark of a tyrant to have men of foreign extraction rather than citizens as

98
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,760
guests at table and companions, feeling that citizens are hostile but strangers make no

99
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,760
claim against him.

100
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,840
I probably didn't do that video concept proper justice back then, but hey, we all

101
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
get better over time.

102
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,720
And while before I used the example of leftists loving immigrants as oddities from a foreign

103
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,640
land while hating their own countrymen, I'll look at it from a different angle this time.

104
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,960
Have you ever noticed that if you happen to know a couple where one partner is secretly

105
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,280
abusive of the other, when you think about your interactions with them, you will begin

106
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,360
to notice a pattern?

107
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,060
More specifically, that the abusive person while at a social event with their partner

108
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,580
is not only quick to brush off their partner's complaints, but also gracious with outsiders

109
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,540
and heavily invested in keeping the peace.

110
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,020
There's a limit to this, of course.

111
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,700
There are extraordinary stories where the abuser snaps publicly, but you know what I

112
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,700
mean.

113
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,700
There's two reasons for this.

114
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,620
One, it's because the abusive dynamic is a product of the relationship and the abuser

115
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,980
feels that outsiders should not be privy to it.

116
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,140
Two, it's because the outsiders do not know the abuser in that way and so they cannot

117
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,140
peer into the darker parts of his soul.

118
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,300
This is all just guesswork by me, but that idea maps onto Aristotle's view of tyrants

119
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,160
well, and it also maps onto the socialist who is willing to support the evil other over

120
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,680
his own familiar homeland.

121
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,740
Level three, where the socialist directly sides with domestic evil, because a socialist

122
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,840
revolution must come from the margins of society.

123
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,400
What happened was the intellectual communists were sent out in cadres, out into these little

124
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,460
towns to find people who would help them round up the kulaks.

125
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,520
So imagine you're in a town and there's three or four people or maybe ten people or

126
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,200
something like that who are a little more successful than everyone else.

127
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,760
There's going to be some people who are not happy about it at all, that are going

128
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,260
to be very resentful about that and jealous.

129
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,620
And so when the intellectuals came in and described the reason that these people should

130
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,760
be treated as parasites and profiteers, then it was the resentful minority in those towns,

131
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,960
and that would be the kind of guy that hangs around in the bar all the time and is completely

132
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,740
unconscious and fails at everything and then blames everyone else for it.

133
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,680
The intellectuals came in and said, here's, this is unfair that this happened to you.

134
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,720
You've actually been victimized and now it's your opportunity to go have your revenge.

135
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,680
It's not hard to find people who are cruel for the sake of being cruel and who have told

136
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,640
themselves that it's because their politics are good and their targets are bad that justifies

137
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
that cruelty.

138
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,740
This makes the cruelty moral, and I say that word moral with heavy air quotes.

139
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,600
This ranges from people playing cover for thieves, looters, and shoplifters, saying

140
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,240
shit like, don't snitch on a thief stealing from a corporation, you didn't see nothing.

141
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,520
Or idiotically calling people racist for noticing the California ransacking problem, to people

142
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,420
playing cover for rioters and arsonists who destroy people's businesses and livelihoods

143
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,660
by saying, oh, that's what insurance is for, lol.

144
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,300
At least that's what they said during the George Floyd riots.

145
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,540
Now that it's a gay bar getting arson instead, people are screaming about how insurance isn't

146
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
enough.

147
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,700
It's funny how that fucking works.

148
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,300
To people openly advocating for the death of their political opponents and the targets

149
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,940
of their ire, and in some cases actually killing them, again, viewing your enemies as ontologically

150
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,940
evil.

151
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,460
I also made a video on this topic as well, quite literally called the identification

152
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,700
with evil, where I described the left's tendencies to claim as their heroes the worst fictional

153
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,100
characters possible, because those characters in rejecting the status quo were subversive.

154
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
The fact that they were evil didn't actually matter.

155
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,500
The video revolved around the new guy meme, where the creator of that comic's moral compass

156
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,620
was so twisted that she actually thought people were going to identify with her self-insert

157
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,180
character, who was cruel and bitter, as opposed to the new guy who genuinely seemed to have

158
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,740
a decency about him, solely because she viewed her politics as being correct.

159
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,220
The issue here, ultimately, is that these people think that a correct politics actually

160
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,660
exists, and that of course, they have the vision of the perfect politics all the time.

161
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,900
Then they're comparing themselves, their behaviours, and their lives to that perfection, constantly

162
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,720
falling short of it and becoming embittered by it, rather than doing what most sane and

163
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,600
normal humans do, which is comparing yourself to who you were yesterday, rather than some

164
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,460
ideal perfect future, and spending your time and energy working on incremental change.

165
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,140
This bitterness seems to be connected to a more general trend among millennials, which

166
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,220
is steeped in cynicism and disappointment.

167
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,660
They thought their lives would turn out differently, and rather than doing what they can, where

168
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,560
they are with what they've got, they'd rather rage at everything around them and be cruel

169
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,740
and drive away what little hope that remains.

170
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:26,120
Level 4, where the socialist hates his own family because they, too, are bourgeois oppressors

171
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,680
for properly working within the system, gaining and having capital, and expecting them to

172
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:46,520
get a fucking job now that they're of age, it's not hard to find terminally online communists

173
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,500
with failed relationships with their families.

174
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,800
In fact, again, I did a video on this topic, too, about how young people tend to hate their

175
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,460
conservative parents, conservative small towns, and conservative upbringings, and after high

176
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,700
school they move to cities and universities to further radicalize.

177
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,400
They constantly say and think, once these old people are dead, we'll be able to outvote

178
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,660
the rest and finally build the socialist utopia.

179
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,120
I should know, when I was a 19 year old socialist, it's exactly what I said and thought, too.

180
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,760
A lot of these people come from extremely privileged backgrounds.

181
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,020
Zoe Quinn, of Gamergate fame, came from the Van Valkenburg family.

182
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,220
Her boyfriend during Gamergate was Alex Lifshitz, who hated his father while simultaneously

183
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,040
living on his military contractor money.

184
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,900
Vosch grew up in Beverly Hills, and his father has an extensive career working in Hollywood.

185
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,740
Hassan Peiker got to where he is because of opportunities given to him by his uncle, Cenk

186
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,700
Uygur, at the Young Turks, and he hit mainstream news for buying a Hollywood mansion.

187
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,220
Even someone smaller like Kefls, the trans woman surrounding the recent Destiny drama

188
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,660
– yes, her time is coming on this channel – calls herself working class, but her parents

189
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,860
had the money to spring for her trips to South Korea and Thailand for expensive transitioning

190
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,860
surgeries.

191
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,540
Seriously, gather up all the progs and commies, put their picks on a dartboard, and throw.

192
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,700
Whomever you hit, you will discover that they were people born with privilege.

193
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,540
Level 5 is what Jordan Peterson talked about at the beginning.

194
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,780
Hatred of being itself, and I get it.

195
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,780
Being is hard.

196
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,780
It's suffering.

197
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,780
There's work involved.

198
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,780
You're going to die.

199
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,140
Everybody you know and love will also die.

200
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,420
Everything you build will fail.

201
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,740
Every accomplishment you achieve will be undone, and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

202
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,900
If you're very lucky, in 100 years time, the sum total of your life – all of the

203
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,140
ups and downs, all of the stages of development, all of the memories, all of the accomplishments,

204
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,180
all of the relationships, all of the experiences – will be reduced to nothing more than a

205
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,220
single inaccurate story that your descendants will tell each other.

206
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,500
And when those descendants die, it will be like you never even existed.

207
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,860
The void waits for us all.

208
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,300
I think I deeply understand the people who have a hatred of being.

209
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,140
And I think that is what's at the bottom of all of this.

210
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,540
Revenge against the universe for having brought you into it.

211
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,060
You didn't consent to bear the burden that is the suffering of life.

212
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,220
It's not fair.

213
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,980
And that's why school shooters do what they do, rather than simply offing themselves quietly

214
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,820
since they want to die so badly.

215
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:50,140
Because somebody has to be punished for that crime, and God's out of reach.

216
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,700
So why not the people at school that made their lives a living hell?

217
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,680
That's why every totalitarian regime, regardless of political slant, destroys whole populations

218
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,540
and moralizes about doing so.

219
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,020
How this is for the greater good.

220
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,740
Here's what's, in my opinion, Huxley's greatest quote.

221
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,500
The surest way to work up a crusade in favor of some good cause is to promise people they

222
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,700
will have the chance of maltreating someone.

223
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,760
To be able to destroy with a good conscience.

224
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,820
To be able to behave badly and call your bad behavior righteous indignation.

225
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,740
That is the height of psychological luxury.

226
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,620
The most delicious of moral treats.

227
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,800
Again, viewing your enemies as ontologically evil.

228
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,380
It's not hard to find people who exist at this level.

229
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,880
Who blindly hate based only on ideology.

230
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,000
Who advocate for widespread death, like all other tyrants before them, in the name of

231
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
a greater good.

232
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,220
Who curse at the victims that they create, because their existence is politically inconvenient.

233
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,100
And though I have no examples to put on screen this time, I have met and seen many depressed

234
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,000
leftists say things like, widespread mental health problems are caused by capitalism.

235
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,900
And I never asked to be born, I hate that I have to work to eat.

236
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,180
These are the laws of nature.

237
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,260
You will always have to work to live, regardless of social change.

238
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,860
Mental health problems are not caused by capitalism, but by your own cynicism about your inability

239
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,880
to achieve the perfection you're addicted to.

240
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,400
This attitude is the hatred of being itself.

241
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,940
And all of this shit is endemic to socialism.

242
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,340
Karl Marx himself would be right at home beside the blue-haired, plaid-wearing, verified

243
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,140
Twitter hipster who hates his job and hates his parents and hates his life.

244
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,560
We all know one of the more famous Marx quotes.

245
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,700
Religion is the opium of the masses.

246
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,900
Here's the full quote.

247
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,460
Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul

248
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,580
of soulless conditions.

249
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,180
It is the opium of the people.

250
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,100
The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is to demand for their

251
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,180
real happiness.

252
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,400
To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to

253
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,600
give up a condition that requires illusions.

254
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,180
The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that veil of tears

255
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,040
of which religion is the halo.

256
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,980
Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain, not in order that man shall

257
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,000
continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw

258
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,600
off the chain and pluck the living flower.

259
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,940
Criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality

260
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,760
like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move

261
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,320
around himself as his own true son.

262
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,940
These are the words of a man who is eternally at war with reality itself.

263
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,860
This is the cry of rage and his inability to reach perfection.

264
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,860
To really hammer the point home, I want to show you some letters to Karl Marx from Heinrich

265
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,980
Marx, his father.

266
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,600
Dear old dad's words about his son give us some insight into what kind of man Marx was.

267
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,420
Frankly speaking, my dear Karl, I do not like this modern world, which all weaklings use

268
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,700
to cloak their feelings when they quarrel with the world because they do not possess,

269
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,520
without labor or trouble, well-furnished palaces with vast sums of money and elegant carriages.

270
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,220
This embitterment disgusts me, and you are the last person from whom I would expect it.

271
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,560
What grounds can you have for it?

272
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,960
Has not everything smiled on you ever since your cradle?

273
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,360
Has not nature endowed you with magnificent talents?

274
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Have your parents not lavished affection on you?

275
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,520
Have you ever up to now been unable to satisfy your reasonable wishes?

276
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,060
And have you not carried away in the most incomprehensible fashion the heart of a girl

277
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,740
whom thousands envy you?

278
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,540
Yet the first untoward event, the first disappointed wish, invokes embitterment.

279
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,540
Is that strength?

280
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,100
Is that a manly character?

281
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,060
This criticism isn't a one-off either.

282
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,460
On several occasions we were without a letter for months, and the last time when you knew

283
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,760
Edward was ill, Mother suffering, and I myself not well, and moreover cholera was raging

284
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
in Berlin.

285
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,320
And as if that did not even call for an apology, your next letter contained not a single word

286
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,640
about it, but merely some badly written lines and an extract from the diary entitled The

287
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,540
Visit, which I would quite frankly prefer to throw out rather than accept, a crazy botch

288
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,660
work which merely testifies how you squander your talents and spend your nights giving

289
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,840
birth to monsters, that you follow in the footsteps of the new immoralists who twist

290
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,640
their words until they themselves do not hear them, who christen a flood of words a

291
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,040
product of genius because it is devoid of ideas or contains only distorted ideas.

292
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,240
As if we were men of wealth, my son disposed in one year of almost seven hundred tailors,

293
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,920
contrary to all agreement, contrary to all usage, whereas the richest spend less than

294
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
five hundred.

295
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
And why?

296
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,880
I do him the justice of saying that he is no rake, no squanderer, but how can a man

297
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,880
who every week or two discovers a new system and has to tear up old works laboriously arrived

298
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,320
at, how can he, I ask, worry about trifles?

299
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,440
How can he submit to the pettiness of order?

300
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,540
Everyone dips a hand in his pocket, and everyone cheats him, so long as he doesn't disturb

301
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,540
him in his studies.

302
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,280
And a new money order is soon written again, of course.

303
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,040
I must add, too, the complaints of your brothers and sisters.

304
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,000
From your letters, one can hardly see that you have any brothers or sisters.

305
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,240
As for the good Sophie, who has suffered so much for you, and Jenny is so lavish in her

306
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,240
devotion to you, you do not think of her when you do not need her.

307
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,960
I have paid your money order for one hundred and sixty tailors.

308
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,880
I cannot or can hardly charge it to the old academic year, for that truly has its full

309
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,880
due.

310
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,280
And for the future I do not want to expect many of the same kind.

311
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,880
Oh, by the way, that request from Marx to stop spending so much money went unheeded,

312
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,720
as we can tell from a third letter.

313
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,520
I am referring to the paltry matter of money, the value of which for the father of a family

314
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,000
you still do not seem to recognize.

315
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But I do all the more.

316
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,040
I do not deny that at times I reproach myself with having left you all too loose a reign

317
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
in this respect.

318
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,080
Thus we are now in the fourth month of the law year, and you have already drawn two hundred

319
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,200
and eighty tailors.

320
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,440
I have not yet earned that much this winter.

321
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,880
I am sorry for that gigantic block of text, but I really wanted to hammer the point home.

322
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,480
Marx was considered to be brilliant, but also depressive, manipulative, potentially even

323
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
sociopathic.

324
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,400
He treated his parents like a bank account, he only considered his family insofar as he

325
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
could use them.

326
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,460
His father was dismayed at who Marx was becoming, despite his talents and his upbringing.

327
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,600
And as an adult, Marx went to war with being itself, and every other socialist follows

328
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,960
in his footsteps.

329
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,880
So when Jordan Peterson says that the bottom of all of this is punishment against God for

330
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,600
the crime of being, if you are looking at that viral clip and thinking that it is just

331
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,360
more bible mumbo jumbo, you are not actually paying attention.

332
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,600
I have said it before, I am an atheist, I don't care about the God part of this conversation,

333
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,520
but it is overwhelmingly clear to me that in a non-religious sense, Peterson is absolutely

334
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
right.

335
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,800
The bitterness and hatred and cruelty that drives a person to destroy those who are doing

336
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,120
better than him because he cannot stand the sight of himself in the mirror every morning,

337
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,600
since whenever he looks into it he sees a failure and he can't bear to take responsibility

338
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,760
for that failure, so he is desperate to offload it onto anything else he can.

339
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,020
If that's the rich, fine, if that's the system, so much the better.

340
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,060
That feeling, those people, they're real, socialism thrives on people like this.

341
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,940
A lot of those replies to the viral clip from the beginning came from people genuinely too

342
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,620
dumb to understand what's going on, but I have a hunch that a lot of them also came

343
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,460
from people who know, deep down, that what Jordan Peterson is describing and what I've

344
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,200
described here, that that's you, that you're the bitter, hateful, cruel person who would

345
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,580
rather punish God for the crime of being than actually do something positive and work to

346
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,580
build up their life.

347
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,660
You terminally online dumbfucks are addicted to reading Twitter trending headlines 16 hours

348
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,420
a day because social media makes the socialist movement look bigger than it actually is.

349
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,660
You can get into your bubble and circlejerk about the impending revolution all day long,

350
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,780
I know your communities feel big because there's a lot of tweets and retweets, but in the real

351
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,660
world nobody actually likes you, they'll never meet a single person in real life who

352
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,760
gives anywhere near as much of a fuck as you do about it.

353
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,480
The few real friends you do actually have all think you're neurotic as fuck for obsessing

354
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,700
over Catalonia or Zapatista or Rojava, nobody knows what the weird fucking flags hanging

355
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,300
in your room are, your favorite breadtuber doesn't know your parasocial ass exists,

356
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,220
your weird anarcho-syndicalist with South American characteristic streams get less views

357
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,700
than my fucking gaming channel, you will never accomplish any of your political goals, and

358
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,680
if you don't fucking stop and log off, you are going to spend the rest of your life wasting

359
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,140
away online accomplishing nothing but ratios on Twitter.
