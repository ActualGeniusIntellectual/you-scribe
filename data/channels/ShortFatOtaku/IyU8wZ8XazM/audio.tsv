0	6400	oh god oh my god you guys i accidentally deleted my libs of tiktok file i've been saving little
6400	10640	tidbits of info for months as i do you know i do this if you ever watched a video or stream where
10640	14720	i described my work process i figured it was finally time to do the video now that the whole
14720	19200	taylor lorenz thing is going on went to grab my file and it was gone and the worst part is i'm
19200	23520	pretty sure i just mindlessly deleted it when clearing out some old stuff because it was right
23520	27360	near the stuff i was deleting well that's what i get for being a boomer and keeping everything on
27360	31840	my desktop i guess but you know what maybe it's not so bad i think i can recreate everything i
31840	36320	had saved up well enough let's give it a shot before we can talk about taylor lorenz we have
36320	40320	to talk about libs of tiktok libs of tiktok is a twitter account that began with the gimmick of
40320	44560	dredging up especially cringy progressive and socialist videos on tiktok and reposting them
44560	49440	with limited or no commentary cue me getting angry at americans using the word liberal incorrectly
49440	53520	for the billionth time but you know whatever we all know what's going on at the beginning libs of
53520	58160	tiktok functioned a lot like the various posting their ells accounts these accounts would provide
58160	62480	little to no commentary of their own simply reposting other people's content the idea is
62480	66800	that while the audience of the original posters of that content would be supportive of the message
66800	71920	the audience of the ells account wouldn't be the ells account would therefore act as a quasi expose
71920	76000	even though the content they post is entirely public and accessible to anyone and the value
76000	80320	would come not through adding commentary but providing the content to an audience that is
80320	85280	explicitly poised against it now if you were to ask the question why is reposting other people's
85280	90080	content bad the surface level answer is of course you're stealing content without reacting to it
90080	94320	that's what i bitched at on efap for three weeks in a row recently regarding hasan go watch that
94320	99360	if you like but while hasan outright steals content wholesale playing it for a stream while
99360	104880	providing no additional commentary and no citation the courts have ruled that reposting content while
104880	109360	adding no additional commentary with the intention that the content nonetheless be seen in a
109360	112800	different light because it's being transmitted to a different audience by a different person
112800	117840	constitutes a transformative use that's the whole reason that sargon won his lawsuit against akila
117840	122880	obviously so since this sort of thing actually isn't theft what's the next level answer to the
122880	127840	question why is reposting other people's content bad and the progressive answer seems to be that
127840	132720	it has to be bad because while twitter and tiktok and other platforms don't ban the original posters
132720	137680	of the content they have banned some of the most infamous ells accounts like trans women posting
137680	142240	their ells e-girls posting their ells and vosh fans posting their ells you call it selling out
142240	148480	your principles not not today not this time even though these accounts also simply reposted content
148480	152560	while adding only some of their own commentary they all eventually got nuked from orbit by
152560	157040	twitter presumably because the act of shining a spotlight on the bad behavior of members of
157040	161360	protected classes or people who are politically correct just brings too much heat down on the
161360	165920	platform libs of tiktok for a long time managed to ride that line of culpability perfectly and
165920	169200	so they didn't get a quick ban like those other accounts that i mentioned the libs of tiktok
169200	172880	account was previously several other gimmick accounts tweeting about kuomo at one point and
172880	177360	then as a potted plant in the white house at another but the whole reposting people's manic
177360	182320	rants with no comment thing went viral repeatedly so that was the gimmick that stuck but like its
182320	187040	brethren libs of tiktok would eventually fly too close to the sun though the account posted all
187040	192080	sorts of leftist content initially libs of tiktok eventually focused in on posting videos made by
192080	197520	teachers in the context of florida's don't say gay bills where left-leaning teachers openly mocked
197520	209360	the liberal idea of neutrality in education defied the parents of children who may have been
209360	214240	lgbt questioning hey if your parents don't love and accept you for who you are this christmas
214240	220080	fuck them i'm your parents now i'm proud of you drink some water i love you bye advocated for the
220080	224800	position of pedophiles or as they call minor attracted persons um i use the term minor
224800	228960	attracted person or map in the title and throughout the book for multiple reasons
229600	234960	first of all because i think it's important to use terminology for groups that members of that group
234960	241360	want others to use for them and map advocacy groups like before you act have advocated for
241360	247760	use of the term map they've advocated for it primarily because it's less stigmatizing than
247760	253280	other terms like pedophile a lot of people when they hear the term pedophile they automatically
253280	258880	assume that it means a sex offender and that isn't true and it leads to a lot of misconceptions
258880	264160	about attractions toward minors i've definitely heard the idea that you brought up though that
264160	268400	the use of the term minor attracted person suggests that it's okay to be attracted to
268400	274240	children but using a term that communicates who someone is attracted to that doesn't indicate
274240	278480	anything about the morality of that attraction here's mocking that liberal idea of neutrality
278480	283680	again these people don't believe in the idea of an ideology free space where ideas can be formed
283680	288400	and tested to the conservative news source that wrote an article about me that seemed really
288400	293280	focused on the flags i have in my classroom um there's a couple of things you missed actually
293280	297120	in here the first thing you missed is all 13 principles of the black lives matter movement
297120	302480	hung up at the top of my wall here because i want my students to know that flag is not just
302480	306800	a decoration but that we actually live out these principles in our everyday life you definitely
306800	311440	missed my smaller posters including this one about getting vaccinated about voting all these ones i
311440	316160	have from jay salazar that are black historical figures man you missed a lot including some of
316160	321200	the memorabilia and awards i've won as michigan teacher of the year but like go off about my flags
321200	326720	talking to toddlers about intersex for some reason here's a developmentally appropriate way to talk
326720	334080	to toddlers about bodies and gender you know the body parts that your diaper or your panties
334080	341920	or your underwear cover those are called privates everyone has privates private means that they
341920	351760	belong to you and only you in the front everybody has genitals but there are different kinds of
351760	363280	genitals some genitals are called a penis some are called a vulva others look maybe a little bit
364080	370320	like each in some ways or kind of like neither or somewhere in between
371840	379440	people with those kind of genitals are called intersex when babies are born parents sometimes
380160	388240	guess their gender based on their genitals they tend to guess boy for babies who have a penis
388240	395920	and girl for babies who have a vulva sometimes parents guess wrong though and that's okay
395920	402400	everybody makes mistakes sometimes people whose parents guessed wrong about their gender are
402400	406960	called transgender and here's apologia for enthusiastic consent for children having sex
406960	413360	with adults also if young people are initiating sexual activities with adults or enthusiastically
413360	420160	involved we can't be effective in working with them if we assume that all such relationships
420160	426160	start with a predatory or criminally inclined inclined adult the as we're seeing in the
426160	435920	discussion young people bridle at being forced into this box of being seen as being the victim
435920	440720	of a predator i can actually keep this list going for a very long time literally just scroll down
440720	444080	the libs of tiktok account yourself if you want to see these clips there's got to be hundreds at
444080	448720	this point but as more and more teachers started making tiktok videos about the various ways in
448720	453040	which they were subverting the system libs of tiktok found more and more success shining a
453040	457120	spotlight on these people the account was so successful that tucker carlson gave it a shout
457120	462720	out on april 8th so in classrooms amaze.org isn't even necessary a lot of times some teachers do
462720	467520	the jobs themselves we know that in part because the hard work of a twitter account called libs of
467520	471680	tiktok which you ought to follow before it's banned if you want to know what may be happening
471680	476080	in your child's school libs of tiktok just unearthed this video shows a teacher bragging
476080	483360	to her students about her sex life little kids watch man y'all thought me uh teaching the children
483360	490560	about me being poly was crazy but not only that but they also know that i'm gender fluid
490560	497520	this was all well and good until october when i also explained to them that i'm pagan so i am
497520	503600	also a witch and i come into work and one of the children goes lois are you a boy you have short
503600	513760	hair and his sister goes no lois is a girl and a third child who's my favorite suddenly yells no
513760	524080	guys we've been over this lois isn't a boy or a girl lois is a witch so underneath all of this
524080	529920	needless to say and you can't say it enough is narcissism it's about me and my identity and my
529920	533360	journey it's not about you or your children teaching them anything it's about me let me talk
533360	538640	about me some more and by april 13th libs of tiktok had been brigaded and spam reported causing
538640	543600	twitter to temporarily ban the page for 12 hours the violation was hateful conduct even though
543600	547600	like i said before all they really did was repost and spotlight other people's stuff but the whole
547600	553040	thing really blew up with taylor lorenz the libs of tiktok account maintained its anonymity since
553040	557120	its creation as the creator has stated that they didn't want to be publicly known since they feared
557120	562400	backlash but taylor lorenz for some reason began to suspect christina pushaw the press secretary of
562400	567120	governor ron disantis as being involved with the account acting like every other scumbag reporter
567120	571040	lorenz emailed pushaw with extremely short notice hoping to be able to publish a line that would
571040	574560	read something like pushaw did not respond for comment because that looks a lot worse than it
574560	579040	actually is but pushaw did respond and also mocked lorenz publicly for the underhanded tactics
579040	583440	lorenz's reply read will note that you declined to comment on your relationship with the account
583440	588000	which was also mocked because the only relationship pushaw has with the libs of tiktok account is
588000	593280	liking the tweets in the end lorenz's article in the washington post would drop on april 19th in
593280	598000	which she described digging through archived versions of the libs of tiktok account or rather
598000	603040	she just took the digging that travis brown did a software developer but the research spanned back
603040	607200	to the white house potted plant gimmick the kuomo gimmick and even earlier where it was discovered
607200	612080	that the account was first known as shaya underscore ray and the owner publicly identified
612080	617280	herself as a real estate investor in brooklyn as shy array the account live tweeted from the january
617280	622000	6th capital riots claiming to have been in attendance the account's display name was chaya
622000	627760	raychick and when the website libs of tiktok.us was registered it was done so under that legal
627760	632000	name the phone number that website is registered to is also the same number attached to chaya
632000	636240	raychick's business profile in real estate when lorenz called the number she was hung up on and
636240	640080	when lorenz visited the address attached this information in la the woman at the door refused
640080	644800	to identify herself but the libs of tiktok account would later post a picture of lorenz through the
644800	649600	bars of a front door stating which of my relatives did you enjoy harassing the most at their homes
649600	655360	yesterday hey chaya is this you okay joking aside on the one hand i don't like this tendency of the
655360	659360	media to hunt down people with the incorrect political opinions and badger them at their
659360	664000	places of residence like this it reminds me of when cnn got so booty blasted they threatened
664000	669120	to dox a reddit user by the name of han asshole solo for making fun of cnn with a trump gift back
669120	674240	in the day but on the other hand keep in mind libs of tiktok does sometimes do comparable things they
674240	678320	expose the real faces and sometimes the real workplaces of the people that they put up for
678320	682560	display and libs of tiktok does it because they disagree with their politics both of them from
682560	686560	their own points of view believe they're doing the right thing and both of them consider some
686560	691280	form of doxing or public exposure or whatever you want to call it justified because of the actions
691280	696560	of their political opponents the question you have to ask though is it justified the person behind
696560	700800	the libs of tiktok account believes they're exposing groomers and saving kids and if that's
700800	705040	the case then there's probably a solid argument but taylor lorenz believes that the libs of tiktok
705040	710400	account is actively harming lgbt youth getting innocent teachers suspended and fired instituting
710400	714560	a witch hunt and if that's true that's also a solid argument against it so i guess we need to
714560	719680	find out which of these interpretations is true if either of them may be examining lorenz's claims
719680	724800	about the libs of tiktok account will help out claim one regarding tyler wren tyler wren a
724800	730160	former english teacher in oklahoma posted a video telling lgbtq kids shunned by their parents that
730160	734400	wren was proud of them and loved them it was featured on libs of tiktok last week since being
734400	739200	featured on the page wren has been barraged with harassment and death threats now this is a video
739200	743680	that we watched earlier and lorenz's description of the video's content is missing some key context
743680	748320	hey if your parents don't love and accept you for who you are this christmas fuck them i'm your
748320	753920	parents now i'm proud of you drink some water i love you bye lorenz excludes the part of the
753920	759440	clip where wren says i'm your parents now the clip's inclusion on the libs of tiktok page plays
759440	764000	into the rightest conception of the culture war to be sure but the exclamation that teachers should
764000	768400	supplant the parental role plays into the leftist conception of the culture war as well something
768400	773840	that lorenz left out in her claim claim too that libs of tiktok posted a video of a woman teaching
773840	778480	sex education to children in kentucky calling the woman in the video a predator again this isn't
778480	783040	entirely accurate here's what the actual thread looks like the first post reads this woman is
783040	787120	running a sexy summer camp for children in kentucky she says she thinks it's good for
787120	792080	toddlers to masturbate with this accompanying video clip that's how we should you know like get
792080	798080	down with yourself explore your own body masturbation is really healthy and i recommend it to people of
798080	804560	all ages all ages as soon as my nephews could talk they were doing that that's what they were doing
804560	811600	kids touch themselves kids start to ask questions and we teach them the language for their bodies
811600	816960	right that's your nose touch your nose show aunt t you can touch your nose but my sister's not
816960	822400	saying that when they're tugging at their penis right but it feels good right we have to learn
822400	827440	ways to talk to young people about this so that they know how to explore their body consensually
827440	832080	so that it's not in public right we don't want people exploring their bodies in public that's
832080	840080	not consensual but exploring your body at any age grandma's grandpa's all of us need to be exploring
840080	844800	our body the second post reads i work with the school systems my job was not to teach sex ed i
844800	849440	try to figure out ways to work this into the schools this woman is a predator so lorenz was
849440	854960	correct libs of tiktok did indeed call her a predator but lorenz left out all of the context
854960	859600	of exactly what was happening at this kentucky sexy summer camp and by the way the camp was
859600	864000	independently investigated separate from the whole libs of tiktok story by chris rufo writing for
864000	869680	city journal where he describes a non-profit coalition called sexy sex ed which organized a
869680	874400	series of sexy summer camp events targeted towards minors that included lessons on
874400	880880	sex liberation gender exploration bdsm being a sex worker self-managed abortions and sexual
880880	887360	activity while using licit and illicit drugs sexy sex ed's publicly available event calendar lists
887360	892800	the following classes and workshops sex with me self-pleasure workshop gender diversity let's talk
892800	900880	about sex sexy trans sex ed the three p's pee poop pee poop and pleasure sex on drugs and eugenics
900880	905920	and appalachia keep in mind this is a camp for teenagers going as young as 13 and hey while i
905920	910240	might have been jerking off at 13 women like this were the last thing on my mind as i was doing it
910240	915280	claim three that libs of tiktok was leaning hard into groomer discourse calling for any teacher
915280	919520	who comes out as gay to their students to be fired on the spot and yes that's actually exactly what
919520	926000	the tweet says here is the accompanying video so today i came out to my students here's a little
926000	931600	story so in my fifth grade classroom we have a unit where we talk about identity and how
931600	937280	people identify and we talk about traditions and customs that are handed down from ancestors
937280	946800	and things like that so i modeled for the kids today how i identify myself and in doing so i
946800	955120	told them that i identify as a mom as a sister and a daughter as a teacher i said and i identify as
955120	962240	a cis woman and i explained what that was because they had no idea what i was talking about and then
962240	970160	i said and i identify as gay in my 17 years of teaching i've never come out to my kids before
971120	977920	and i was so nervous to even say it out loud to them but they didn't even bat an eye it was really
977920	982960	awesome when i was in grade five that year was the first sex ed course we had and it dealt with
982960	987600	physical biological reproduction how it works in plants and bugs and various types of animals and
987600	992960	humans the social component of sex and puberty waited until grades six and seven what this
992960	998160	person is describing is not only the social component of sex but identity from an intersectional
998160	1002000	framework and the intersectional lens is inherently political i didn't get into this
1002000	1006560	type of stuff until first year gender studies at university to me this seems like it's too much for
1006560	1011760	grade five it's not abusive it's not grooming but certainly inappropriate for the age range claim
1011760	1016240	four that libs of tiktok pushed the false conspiracy theory that schools were installing
1016240	1019920	litter boxes and bathrooms for students who identify as cats and yep i don't even need to
1019920	1024560	confirm this one i went over this in a weekly set myself that one felt a bit too funny to be true
1024560	1029360	no matter how accepted furries might be nowadays this is an l for libs of tiktok they got this one
1029360	1034880	wrong and claim five that libs of tiktok thinks learning about lgbt identities and issues is
1034880	1039680	abusive and that public schools are government-run indoctrination camps again the quotation is
1039680	1044160	correct but lorenz leaves out the included video where the teacher in question has set up a
1044160	1055760	preschool pride parade
1075120	1080240	acclimating kids to political activism before they even know what politics is does seem to be a form
1080240	1085760	of indoctrination to me most of the allegations that taylor lorenz levies against libs of tiktok
1085760	1090800	follows this pattern she gets some stuff right but she purposefully leaves out the context that
1090800	1095280	is the most damning to her position it is also probably important to talk about which popular
1095280	1101360	libs of tiktok posts that lorenz just straight up ignores even though they too are an important part
1101600	1107040	of the account's story like for example a new york state university professor's comments on
1107040	1113200	adult sexual activity with babies there's a couple things to say here one is even if you are looking
1113200	1117040	for a threshold let's say there's a threshold i'm making this number up but let's say it's at age
1117040	1125040	eight um still that tells you that some adult child sex is permissible second the notion that
1125040	1131440	it's wrong even with a one-year-old is not quite obvious to me there are reports in some cultures
1131440	1137200	of grandmothers fellating their the baby boys to calm them down when when a colicky now i don't
1137200	1141600	know if it's true but this is sort of widely reported as occurring in in at least one culture
1141600	1146240	and it working that the grandmothers believe believe this actually works if this were to be
1146240	1151040	true again i don't know it to be true if it were to be true it's hard to see what would be wrong
1151920	1159520	so yeah i guess i think no i don't think there's a blanket period beyond which this is permissible
1159520	1164880	if we're interested in willing participation which is the way i structured it then yeah there's
1164880	1168240	a point below which people aren't willing participants in anything because they don't
1168240	1173040	have intentions or they don't have the sort of mental states that allow for willing participation
1173680	1177760	but no i don't i don't think it's blanket wrong at any age where a medical student who admitted
1177760	1182400	to purposefully missing a person's vein and taking delight in jabbing them with the needle
1182400	1187360	twice after the patient laughed at her pronoun pin or the theater that advertised the family
1187360	1191440	sex show a theater show which opens up conversations around relationships offering
1191440	1196240	safe and positive learning to children young people and guardians about bodies and relationships
1196240	1200560	the show is advertised to families with young kids where the kids can come to learn about sex
1200560	1203920	masturbation all with fully nude actors on stage
1230560	1235360	some tickets to the show or you might just be wondering why we thought making it was a good
1235360	1243200	idea great question um we wanted to make something that uh came at the topic of relationships and sex
1243200	1248800	in a light way um in a way that would open conversations in a way that would encourage
1248800	1255440	people to ask questions um and to allow for that space of vulnerability and not knowing and making
1255440	1262560	mistakes um we hope that the show kind of adds to the more creative or alternative relationships
1262560	1268400	in sex education that is out there at the moment in all different forms and i guess we really
1268400	1273040	wanted to make the show that we wish that we'd had when we were younger and also part of our
1273040	1281200	adult selves felt like or feels like they need now as well um and mostly if we know our bodies then
1281200	1286320	we know our rights hello my name is ailey i'm programming and engagement manager at
1286320	1293520	tobacco factory theaters i am a white female with brown blonde hair and my pronouns are she her
1293520	1299840	family sex show is a fun and playful show for adults and children aged five and up it offers
1299840	1307520	an honest human sex education that is feminist queer non-binary inclusive and sex positive this
1307520	1313280	show can allow audiences of all ages to feel confident about their bodies their boundaries
1313280	1318400	and their sexual health and we really hope to see you here this is all stuff that your average
1318400	1322720	politically disengaged normie would see and immediately think what the fuck is happening
1322720	1327920	over there this is some crazy deranged pedo shit it's all stuff that libs of tik tok has rightfully
1327920	1333280	called out and it's all stuff that lorenz ignored in her expose because it doesn't fit the narrative
1333280	1338000	that she wanted to spin and it's not like lorenz is somehow innocent either she's got a history
1338000	1342640	of doing this sort of crybully back during the whole claudia conway shit show which was a part
1342640	1347200	of my video about people getting more conservative as they age it turned out that it was taylor
1347200	1352640	lorenz that even turned that into a story she had befriended the 15 year old daughter of kellyanne
1352640	1356720	conway encouraged her to make the tik tok videos that eventually went viral and then amplified
1356720	1361360	those tik toks when they came out on her own platform using them as fodder for anti-trump news
1361360	1366960	articles you know when a woman who's three times the age befriends a 15 year old and then pushes
1366960	1372400	her into making expose videos on her high profile parents also she can take them and turn around
1372400	1377280	and boost her own career that sounds like it might be grooming and that's not the only time that taylor
1377280	1382160	lorenz has done this sort of thing when she got a whiff that tech entrepreneur mark anderson used
1382160	1386800	the arcelor i'm assuming that's retard in an online chat room she rushed to tweet about it
1386800	1390560	for even confirming it was accurate information once it came out that it was fake news lorenz
1390560	1395040	issued a correction but what the fuck dude why did she feel the need to speed run over to twitter
1395040	1399360	and drop the news like a tattletale maybe the career boost of being the reporter who scalped
1399360	1405440	mark anderson mattered more to her than you know actually being accurate in august 2020 lorenz
1405440	1410640	published another expose this time about the company influences.com run by influencer talent
1410640	1416240	agent aradna jacob the company specializes in promoting influencers and content creation houses
1416240	1420960	a cancerous business model if ever heard one but lorenz claimed with no proof in her expose
1420960	1426000	that jacob leaked nude images of influencers working under her and exploited them in other ways
1426000	1430400	while simultaneously failing to disclose her relationship with jacob's competitor the united
1430400	1435920	talent agency jacob filed suit in august 2021 against lorenz and the new york times her then
1435920	1440080	employer but lorenz was already spinning up the victim machine months earlier where in reply to
1440080	1445280	jacob's allegations she tweeted out on march 9 2021 it's not an exaggeration to say that the
1445280	1450000	harassment and smear campaign i've had to endure over the past year has destroyed my life no one
1450000	1454240	should have to go through this bitch you golden parachuted your way out of the times over to
1454240	1458480	bezos's newsletter don't pretend your life is ruined it's exactly the opposite your target had
1458480	1463120	the gall to fight back you didn't get your clean victory and now you're taking offense that they
1463120	1468000	didn't just lay over and die and offer up their corpse for your nourishment because it turns out
1468000	1472880	that this was not taylor lorenz's first rodeo a taylor lorenz posting her ells account on twitter
1472880	1478400	was quickly made outlining all of the shit that she's done over the years jesus um these gimmick
1478400	1482240	accounts are getting really specific aren't they here's a scatter shot of some of the dumb shit
1482240	1486480	she's pulled over the years she has in no particular order falsely claimed that the judge
1486480	1491040	report is harassing her which was later refuted by drudge asked people to stop investigating her
1491040	1495360	public statements as a public figure saying that it makes her feel uncomfortable complained about
1495360	1500480	the bourgeois billionaire elite ruling class while simultaneously acting as their foot soldier and
1500480	1505200	megaphone and i think when we think about free speech we have to think about whose speech is
1505200	1510880	free right dox the mother of an instagram star for apparently hating muslims while crying about how
1510880	1516320	the blowback of publishing that article led to her apparently being doxed and harassed out of
1516320	1521760	her apartment screeched about being stalked when her book account got followed by the stalker and
1521760	1526960	how much anxiety and stress it causes her to have these boundaries crossed even though she of course
1526960	1531120	showed up at libs of tiktok's house there's been a bunch of smaller data points not on the lorenz
1531120	1535600	l's account to consider as well for example lorenz's investigations of the person behind
1535600	1539920	libs of tiktok led to her contacting an unrelated person with the same name and that person was
1539920	1544480	shortly after dog piled the internet archive has decided to exclude lorenz's twitter account from
1544480	1548400	the wayback machine despite the archive's stated mission to provide universal access to all
1548400	1552880	knowledge after the archive started turning up blanks lorenz's twitter account went from having
1552880	1560240	16 800 tweets to only 3500 back in january of 2022 lorenz posted a video explaining why it's
1560240	1565920	bad when the media dox is a person who is a private figure without getting a statement from them
1565920	1569920	a bunch of people are asking if i'm going to write about the west home caleb story no i'm on book
1569920	1574720	leave i can't keep writing pieces for the new york times i literally do have a lot of deadlines
1574720	1579440	but journalists who are writing about it please speak to people with experience and online
1579440	1583920	harassment i'm not gonna lie i've been pretty horrified by a lot of the media coverage of this
1584800	1589120	a lot of people are just aggregating some of the cruelest commentary online and whipping it all
1589120	1594160	up into a news story with absolutely no comment from caleb or nuance about the situation the top
1594160	1598800	story on google yesterday was literally this house beautiful story that dox's caleb puts his full
1598800	1604720	name in the story zero comment from this man after this whole article gleefully encourages this online
1604720	1609840	harassment and doxing campaign they literally use him to sell west elm furniture through affiliate
1609840	1616880	links once again commercializing a harassment and doxing campaign i think the media needs a
1616880	1620400	total wake-up call in the way that they cover online harassment and this is just the latest
1620400	1625840	example of it and reporters should be adding nuance not just piling on exactly what she did
1625840	1631920	to the owner of libs of tik tok um i think it's rare to see an account gain so much prominence
1631920	1636720	so quickly and be shaping these narratives in such an effective way especially against trans
1636720	1641600	people um so i was i mean my story was kind of long but i really wanted to make the case like
1641600	1645600	why this account mattered and i think it's incredibly important you know as someone that
1645600	1651120	covers the influence or industry to know who is exerting influence in in this way i mean for all
1651120	1656080	we knew this could have been a foreign actor right or someone we just didn't know and so i thought hey
1656080	1660160	look this account has massive power massive influence this woman is basically on an entire
1660160	1664800	right-wing media tour she gave interviews to the new york post tucker all of that um and registered
1664800	1670080	as a media company uh registered a trademark so yeah i wanted to i i thought it was quite
1670080	1674880	important and in the public interest to find out who was running it lorenz has given multiple
1674880	1680160	interviews where she talks about being harassed dox discovered and how absolutely harrowing it is
1680160	1685840	an online online harassment is such a is such a it's such a misnomer um i think it's a huge
1685840	1692400	problem because um you know harassment is is a is is it it's a tool to silence people especially
1692400	1698240	women and people of color people from marginalized um identities for speaking out and it there's a
1698240	1703040	very intentional like goal behind it it's it's obviously it's death threats and all of that and
1703040	1708320	rape threats on the daily and it's not just twitter it's like every single surface right like you know
1708320	1712560	my cell phone number getting out there people calling people harassing my family members
1712640	1718240	stalking me like all of that is incredibly terrifying and invasive um and it's bled out
1718240	1724240	into the physical world too which is even more terrifying right yeah but to me i think what
1724240	1728400	what especially the media needs to understand about this in terms of protecting their own
1728400	1734000	reporters is this is just a tool like harassment is a tool to kind of discredit and silence
1734000	1739920	journalists and the right-wing media plays along with it you feel like any little piece of
1739920	1745760	information that gets out on you will be used by the worst people on the internet to destroy your
1745760	1758000	life and it's so isolating and terrifying it's horrifying i'm so sorry it's overwhelming it's
1758000	1762960	really hard and after all of this ridiculous hypocrisy came to light lorenze hit up twitter
1762960	1767680	once again to talk about how she is the victim in the situation because the general public didn't
1767680	1772000	like how she docks the person behind libs of tiktok of course the washington post circled
1772000	1776400	the wagons around her reminding me a lot frankly of the special treatment that sarah john got back
1776400	1780880	in the day of course the individual behind libs of tiktok also got to speak to tucker carlson live
1780880	1787280	eventually as well they wanted to intimidate me into silence um and unfortunately for them
1787280	1792560	that's just never gonna happen well i'm grateful to hear that you're not intimidated were you a
1792560	1797600	little surprised to see of all people taylor rens who complained bitterly when we used her name on
1797600	1804320	the air several months ago who whined and cried on television because she had ptsd because people
1804320	1808800	were criticizing her on the line were you surprised that it was her who came after you
1808800	1815840	personally and tried to destroy your life yeah i thought that was really humorous i it added a
1815840	1821280	really nice nice layer of humor on top of the whole story um and i think that the fact that
1821280	1828560	it was taylor rens who is a known you know hypocrite and keen is known to dogs people
1828560	1832880	the fact that it was her that was doing all this um it i think it just helped people
1833920	1839280	rally with support for me have you noticed i mean i know you're not a psychiatrist or perhaps you
1839280	1844720	are i don't know who you are um but are you surprised that the people who are the most
1844720	1850960	deeply enmeshed in narcissism who talk about themselves the most are also capable of the
1850960	1857520	greatest cruelty have you noticed that trend um yes i've noticed that a lot i've noticed it with
1857520	1862640	a lot of tiktoks as well um i think it's a little bit of a trend it's not like the right was going
1862640	1867120	to simply let this kind of cultural phenomenon fade away without a fight but that's not really
1867120	1871280	all that important it's just libs of tiktok doing her own circuit in the media as a victim even if
1871280	1875600	it's well deserved it's still part of the game lorenz's criticism is that libs of tiktok is a
1875600	1879840	locus of influence in the culture war this is obviously correct but it's not entirely clear
1879840	1884400	to me that libs of tiktok is somehow the aggressor or the aggrieved party in this exchange from the
1884400	1888400	point of view of lorenz libs of tiktok is in the wrong because at the end of the day it's just
1888400	1892880	politically expedient lorenz's political agenda is better served without a watchdog pointing out the
1892880	1897200	subversion to the normies however from the point of view of libs of tiktok lorenz is in the wrong
1897200	1901440	because it's also politically expedient libs of tiktok's political agenda is better served by her
1901440	1906000	remaining anonymous and unimpeded in exposing subversion but how about from the point of view
1906000	1910240	of the normies themselves from that position it seems to be the case that lorenz is in the wrong
1910240	1914720	because the normies would undoubtedly object to a lot of the shit that libs of tiktok exposes
1914720	1919040	in the counter argument that libs of tiktok just takes things out of context and that with the
1919040	1924080	proper context normies would be more accepting of what's going on just doesn't seem to be true a lot
1924080	1929120	of the time to me it seems like neither party is acting in line with any sort of principled
1929120	1934320	anti-doxing stance libs of tiktok has no problem publishing faces names and jobs of people on her
1934320	1938800	platform hoping the public's wrath will fall upon them taylor lorenz has a history of doing the same
1938800	1943760	thing to advance her own career both have stretched the truth to make a point libs of tiktok is often
1943760	1948560	a lot meaner than she needs to be in her snide comments that she attaches to videos meanwhile
1948560	1953680	lorenz is absolutely a cry bully who plays the victim card to the max while still being cute and
1953680	1958720	cheeky when those same actions benefit her where libs of tiktok might be a little bit too edgy or
1958720	1963360	maybe even a little bit cruel for some people's tastes lorenz is absolutely a person who fake
1963360	1968400	cries and actively seeks out victimization as a method of furthering her career but most
1968400	1973680	importantly the way that each of them operates exposes a huge values difference libs of tiktok
1973680	1978400	thinks of exposing people as exposing their behavior even if she misses context or gets
1978400	1983200	something wrong or falls for fake news she is focused on the behaviors of these subversive prog
1983200	1987440	activists what they're doing with the power over children that they currently wield but lorenz
1987440	1992240	thinks of exposing people as exposing their identities there is no criticism of libs of tiktok's
1992240	1996480	behavior coming out of lorenz that actually holds up because lorenz is happy to do the same thing
1996480	2000480	when it's in her interest and striking all the hypocrisy from the record the only thing that
2000480	2005600	she has to say about libs of tiktok is right wing bad that might be a good virtue signal but it's
2005600	2010640	not a good argument where libs of tiktok points to bad behavior and says look at what these people
2010640	2015520	are doing lorenz points to a hidden identity and says look at who my political opponent is it's an
2015520	2019280	important distinction and to me it's at least partial evidence that the progs are scared of
2019280	2023680	the effectiveness of what libs of tiktok is doing they're using the same tactic they've always leaned
2023680	2029120	on for over a decade now docs intimidate defund or get fired somehow if possible in order to silence
2029120	2033440	political opponents if libs of tiktok stops posting they automatically win which is why
2033440	2038960	they're exploring every avenue to see it through but libs of tiktok has only grown not diminished
2038960	2044160	in influence they're even being cited as an inspiration in florida's recent don't say gay
2044160	2051120	law hate and homophobia is lurking right beneath the surface in american politics right now years
2051120	2056720	of increasing acceptance of gays and transgenders is provoking a backlash on right-wing talk shows
2056720	2062960	and in state houses that's the backdrop for this washington post piece about libs of tiktok a
2062960	2068400	twitter account that shares and sometimes ridicules public posts from progressive educators and others
2068400	2073920	deemed libs taylor lorenz's story revealed the identity of the conservative woman
2073920	2079120	running libs of tiktok and now there's a roiling debate about her story and the ethics of it
2079120	2084640	but there's no debating the influence of the libs of tiktok account it's even helped inform
2084640	2090240	florida's recent parental rights law deemed the don't say gay bill by opponents which is likely
2090240	2094880	one of the big reasons that taylor lorenz targeted her in the first place libs of tiktok isn't perfect
2094880	2098880	sure she sometimes stretches the truth make a point because sensationalism is what makes a
2098880	2104000	tweet go viral not necessarily the facts but at the end of the day she is shining a spotlight on
2104000	2108400	the behavior of some pretty bad people using nothing but their own words and if i had to choose
2108400	2112720	libs of tiktok is preferable to the naked opportunism and hypocrisy of taylor lorenz
2114800	2118800	here's a quick addendum that i'm recording during editing guys tim pool ended up taking out a
2118800	2124640	billboard in time square that says taylor lorenz docs libs of tiktok dude i bet most people walking
2124640	2128640	through time square have no fucking idea what's going on why did you think this would be a good
2128640	2134160	plan i mean it's funny but it's a giant waste of money but look at lorenz's reply this billboard
2134160	2139200	is so undeniably idiotic it's hilarious but don't forget that these campaigns have a much
2139200	2143840	darker and more violent side i'm grateful to be at a newsroom that recognizes these bad faith
2143840	2148320	politically motivated attacks as a strong security team the abuse that women over 40 have to deal
2148320	2152640	with this industry is horrifying make it make sense america you make it make sense taylor did
2152640	2156800	you not do the exact same thing you're whining about two libs of tiktok by showing up at her
2156800	2161760	home did she not suffer from the same horrifying abuse from you tim's reply was to say i'm not
2161760	2165760	describing your reporting i've repeatedly said it was justified in publishing a name we can argue
2165760	2170640	the merits i'm calling you out for lying when you and washington post denied linking to private
2170640	2174880	details you publish libs of tiktok's private address just own it i'm glad to hear you're
2174880	2178800	not upset and your friends and fans are also happy it's the way it should be you make a statement
2178800	2183360	i can test it we all made our points heard you on cnn me and time square now we move on completely
2183360	2186960	reasonable take tit for tat you both get the spotlight shown on you you hash it out welcome
2186960	2190560	to the public sphere of course taylor's not interested in any kind of mutual back and forth
2190560	2194880	she thinks that she has a license to simply harass whoever she wants and they shouldn't be able to
2194880	2199600	speak back my family and friends aren't happy they've been subject to non-stop stream of hateful
2199600	2204080	attacks doxing and violent attacks driven by this baseless campaign i'm happy to hear you're moving
2204080	2208400	on oh fuck right off you are loving this shit this is the most traction your career has ever
2208400	2212640	gotten you are going to milk this victimhood into a promotion and we both know it you're over here
2212640	2217040	whining over getting the clap back you deserve you are a crybully and i don't care how many
2217040	2222160	crocodile tears you shed over having done to you what you have built a career out of doing to others
2223840	2227920	you've been doxed you've been threatened you've been harassed by tucker carlson just for calling
2227920	2233840	out online harassment they'll threaten children they'll threaten my parents i've had to remove
2233840	2240480	every single social tie i had severe ptsd from this i i contemplated suicide it got really bad
2241280	2243680	you feel like any little piece of information
2244800	2249120	that gets out on you will be used by the worst people on the internet to destroy your life
2249840	2258400	and it's i bring a message from her majesty taylor lorenz freedom to any man who identifies the
2258400	2271920	slave known as libs of tiktok i'm libs of tiktok tiktok tiktok tiktok i'm lives of tiktok tiktok
