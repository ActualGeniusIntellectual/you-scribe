{"text": " oh god oh my god you guys i accidentally deleted my libs of tiktok file i've been saving little tidbits of info for months as i do you know i do this if you ever watched a video or stream where i described my work process i figured it was finally time to do the video now that the whole taylor lorenz thing is going on went to grab my file and it was gone and the worst part is i'm pretty sure i just mindlessly deleted it when clearing out some old stuff because it was right near the stuff i was deleting well that's what i get for being a boomer and keeping everything on my desktop i guess but you know what maybe it's not so bad i think i can recreate everything i had saved up well enough let's give it a shot before we can talk about taylor lorenz we have to talk about libs of tiktok libs of tiktok is a twitter account that began with the gimmick of dredging up especially cringy progressive and socialist videos on tiktok and reposting them with limited or no commentary cue me getting angry at americans using the word liberal incorrectly for the billionth time but you know whatever we all know what's going on at the beginning libs of tiktok functioned a lot like the various posting their ells accounts these accounts would provide little to no commentary of their own simply reposting other people's content the idea is that while the audience of the original posters of that content would be supportive of the message the audience of the ells account wouldn't be the ells account would therefore act as a quasi expose even though the content they post is entirely public and accessible to anyone and the value would come not through adding commentary but providing the content to an audience that is explicitly poised against it now if you were to ask the question why is reposting other people's content bad the surface level answer is of course you're stealing content without reacting to it that's what i bitched at on efap for three weeks in a row recently regarding hasan go watch that if you like but while hasan outright steals content wholesale playing it for a stream while providing no additional commentary and no citation the courts have ruled that reposting content while adding no additional commentary with the intention that the content nonetheless be seen in a different light because it's being transmitted to a different audience by a different person constitutes a transformative use that's the whole reason that sargon won his lawsuit against akila obviously so since this sort of thing actually isn't theft what's the next level answer to the question why is reposting other people's content bad and the progressive answer seems to be that it has to be bad because while twitter and tiktok and other platforms don't ban the original posters of the content they have banned some of the most infamous ells accounts like trans women posting their ells e-girls posting their ells and vosh fans posting their ells you call it selling out your principles not not today not this time even though these accounts also simply reposted content while adding only some of their own commentary they all eventually got nuked from orbit by twitter presumably because the act of shining a spotlight on the bad behavior of members of protected classes or people who are politically correct just brings too much heat down on the platform libs of tiktok for a long time managed to ride that line of culpability perfectly and so they didn't get a quick ban like those other accounts that i mentioned the libs of tiktok account was previously several other gimmick accounts tweeting about kuomo at one point and then as a potted plant in the white house at another but the whole reposting people's manic rants with no comment thing went viral repeatedly so that was the gimmick that stuck but like its brethren libs of tiktok would eventually fly too close to the sun though the account posted all sorts of leftist content initially libs of tiktok eventually focused in on posting videos made by teachers in the context of florida's don't say gay bills where left-leaning teachers openly mocked the liberal idea of neutrality in education defied the parents of children who may have been lgbt questioning hey if your parents don't love and accept you for who you are this christmas fuck them i'm your parents now i'm proud of you drink some water i love you bye advocated for the position of pedophiles or as they call minor attracted persons um i use the term minor attracted person or map in the title and throughout the book for multiple reasons first of all because i think it's important to use terminology for groups that members of that group want others to use for them and map advocacy groups like before you act have advocated for use of the term map they've advocated for it primarily because it's less stigmatizing than other terms like pedophile a lot of people when they hear the term pedophile they automatically assume that it means a sex offender and that isn't true and it leads to a lot of misconceptions about attractions toward minors i've definitely heard the idea that you brought up though that the use of the term minor attracted person suggests that it's okay to be attracted to children but using a term that communicates who someone is attracted to that doesn't indicate anything about the morality of that attraction here's mocking that liberal idea of neutrality again these people don't believe in the idea of an ideology free space where ideas can be formed and tested to the conservative news source that wrote an article about me that seemed really focused on the flags i have in my classroom um there's a couple of things you missed actually in here the first thing you missed is all 13 principles of the black lives matter movement hung up at the top of my wall here because i want my students to know that flag is not just a decoration but that we actually live out these principles in our everyday life you definitely missed my smaller posters including this one about getting vaccinated about voting all these ones i have from jay salazar that are black historical figures man you missed a lot including some of the memorabilia and awards i've won as michigan teacher of the year but like go off about my flags talking to toddlers about intersex for some reason here's a developmentally appropriate way to talk to toddlers about bodies and gender you know the body parts that your diaper or your panties or your underwear cover those are called privates everyone has privates private means that they belong to you and only you in the front everybody has genitals but there are different kinds of genitals some genitals are called a penis some are called a vulva others look maybe a little bit like each in some ways or kind of like neither or somewhere in between people with those kind of genitals are called intersex when babies are born parents sometimes guess their gender based on their genitals they tend to guess boy for babies who have a penis and girl for babies who have a vulva sometimes parents guess wrong though and that's okay everybody makes mistakes sometimes people whose parents guessed wrong about their gender are called transgender and here's apologia for enthusiastic consent for children having sex with adults also if young people are initiating sexual activities with adults or enthusiastically involved we can't be effective in working with them if we assume that all such relationships start with a predatory or criminally inclined inclined adult the as we're seeing in the discussion young people bridle at being forced into this box of being seen as being the victim of a predator i can actually keep this list going for a very long time literally just scroll down the libs of tiktok account yourself if you want to see these clips there's got to be hundreds at this point but as more and more teachers started making tiktok videos about the various ways in which they were subverting the system libs of tiktok found more and more success shining a spotlight on these people the account was so successful that tucker carlson gave it a shout out on april 8th so in classrooms amaze.org isn't even necessary a lot of times some teachers do the jobs themselves we know that in part because the hard work of a twitter account called libs of tiktok which you ought to follow before it's banned if you want to know what may be happening in your child's school libs of tiktok just unearthed this video shows a teacher bragging to her students about her sex life little kids watch man y'all thought me uh teaching the children about me being poly was crazy but not only that but they also know that i'm gender fluid this was all well and good until october when i also explained to them that i'm pagan so i am also a witch and i come into work and one of the children goes lois are you a boy you have short hair and his sister goes no lois is a girl and a third child who's my favorite suddenly yells no guys we've been over this lois isn't a boy or a girl lois is a witch so underneath all of this needless to say and you can't say it enough is narcissism it's about me and my identity and my journey it's not about you or your children teaching them anything it's about me let me talk about me some more and by april 13th libs of tiktok had been brigaded and spam reported causing twitter to temporarily ban the page for 12 hours the violation was hateful conduct even though like i said before all they really did was repost and spotlight other people's stuff but the whole thing really blew up with taylor lorenz the libs of tiktok account maintained its anonymity since its creation as the creator has stated that they didn't want to be publicly known since they feared backlash but taylor lorenz for some reason began to suspect christina pushaw the press secretary of governor ron disantis as being involved with the account acting like every other scumbag reporter lorenz emailed pushaw with extremely short notice hoping to be able to publish a line that would read something like pushaw did not respond for comment because that looks a lot worse than it actually is but pushaw did respond and also mocked lorenz publicly for the underhanded tactics lorenz's reply read will note that you declined to comment on your relationship with the account which was also mocked because the only relationship pushaw has with the libs of tiktok account is liking the tweets in the end lorenz's article in the washington post would drop on april 19th in which she described digging through archived versions of the libs of tiktok account or rather she just took the digging that travis brown did a software developer but the research spanned back to the white house potted plant gimmick the kuomo gimmick and even earlier where it was discovered that the account was first known as shaya underscore ray and the owner publicly identified herself as a real estate investor in brooklyn as shy array the account live tweeted from the january 6th capital riots claiming to have been in attendance the account's display name was chaya raychick and when the website libs of tiktok.us was registered it was done so under that legal name the phone number that website is registered to is also the same number attached to chaya raychick's business profile in real estate when lorenz called the number she was hung up on and when lorenz visited the address attached this information in la the woman at the door refused to identify herself but the libs of tiktok account would later post a picture of lorenz through the bars of a front door stating which of my relatives did you enjoy harassing the most at their homes yesterday hey chaya is this you okay joking aside on the one hand i don't like this tendency of the media to hunt down people with the incorrect political opinions and badger them at their places of residence like this it reminds me of when cnn got so booty blasted they threatened to dox a reddit user by the name of han asshole solo for making fun of cnn with a trump gift back in the day but on the other hand keep in mind libs of tiktok does sometimes do comparable things they expose the real faces and sometimes the real workplaces of the people that they put up for display and libs of tiktok does it because they disagree with their politics both of them from their own points of view believe they're doing the right thing and both of them consider some form of doxing or public exposure or whatever you want to call it justified because of the actions of their political opponents the question you have to ask though is it justified the person behind the libs of tiktok account believes they're exposing groomers and saving kids and if that's the case then there's probably a solid argument but taylor lorenz believes that the libs of tiktok account is actively harming lgbt youth getting innocent teachers suspended and fired instituting a witch hunt and if that's true that's also a solid argument against it so i guess we need to find out which of these interpretations is true if either of them may be examining lorenz's claims about the libs of tiktok account will help out claim one regarding tyler wren tyler wren a former english teacher in oklahoma posted a video telling lgbtq kids shunned by their parents that wren was proud of them and loved them it was featured on libs of tiktok last week since being featured on the page wren has been barraged with harassment and death threats now this is a video that we watched earlier and lorenz's description of the video's content is missing some key context hey if your parents don't love and accept you for who you are this christmas fuck them i'm your parents now i'm proud of you drink some water i love you bye lorenz excludes the part of the clip where wren says i'm your parents now the clip's inclusion on the libs of tiktok page plays into the rightest conception of the culture war to be sure but the exclamation that teachers should supplant the parental role plays into the leftist conception of the culture war as well something that lorenz left out in her claim claim too that libs of tiktok posted a video of a woman teaching sex education to children in kentucky calling the woman in the video a predator again this isn't entirely accurate here's what the actual thread looks like the first post reads this woman is running a sexy summer camp for children in kentucky she says she thinks it's good for toddlers to masturbate with this accompanying video clip that's how we should you know like get down with yourself explore your own body masturbation is really healthy and i recommend it to people of all ages all ages as soon as my nephews could talk they were doing that that's what they were doing kids touch themselves kids start to ask questions and we teach them the language for their bodies right that's your nose touch your nose show aunt t you can touch your nose but my sister's not saying that when they're tugging at their penis right but it feels good right we have to learn ways to talk to young people about this so that they know how to explore their body consensually so that it's not in public right we don't want people exploring their bodies in public that's not consensual but exploring your body at any age grandma's grandpa's all of us need to be exploring our body the second post reads i work with the school systems my job was not to teach sex ed i try to figure out ways to work this into the schools this woman is a predator so lorenz was correct libs of tiktok did indeed call her a predator but lorenz left out all of the context of exactly what was happening at this kentucky sexy summer camp and by the way the camp was independently investigated separate from the whole libs of tiktok story by chris rufo writing for city journal where he describes a non-profit coalition called sexy sex ed which organized a series of sexy summer camp events targeted towards minors that included lessons on sex liberation gender exploration bdsm being a sex worker self-managed abortions and sexual activity while using licit and illicit drugs sexy sex ed's publicly available event calendar lists the following classes and workshops sex with me self-pleasure workshop gender diversity let's talk about sex sexy trans sex ed the three p's pee poop pee poop and pleasure sex on drugs and eugenics and appalachia keep in mind this is a camp for teenagers going as young as 13 and hey while i might have been jerking off at 13 women like this were the last thing on my mind as i was doing it claim three that libs of tiktok was leaning hard into groomer discourse calling for any teacher who comes out as gay to their students to be fired on the spot and yes that's actually exactly what the tweet says here is the accompanying video so today i came out to my students here's a little story so in my fifth grade classroom we have a unit where we talk about identity and how people identify and we talk about traditions and customs that are handed down from ancestors and things like that so i modeled for the kids today how i identify myself and in doing so i told them that i identify as a mom as a sister and a daughter as a teacher i said and i identify as a cis woman and i explained what that was because they had no idea what i was talking about and then i said and i identify as gay in my 17 years of teaching i've never come out to my kids before and i was so nervous to even say it out loud to them but they didn't even bat an eye it was really awesome when i was in grade five that year was the first sex ed course we had and it dealt with physical biological reproduction how it works in plants and bugs and various types of animals and humans the social component of sex and puberty waited until grades six and seven what this person is describing is not only the social component of sex but identity from an intersectional framework and the intersectional lens is inherently political i didn't get into this type of stuff until first year gender studies at university to me this seems like it's too much for grade five it's not abusive it's not grooming but certainly inappropriate for the age range claim four that libs of tiktok pushed the false conspiracy theory that schools were installing litter boxes and bathrooms for students who identify as cats and yep i don't even need to confirm this one i went over this in a weekly set myself that one felt a bit too funny to be true no matter how accepted furries might be nowadays this is an l for libs of tiktok they got this one wrong and claim five that libs of tiktok thinks learning about lgbt identities and issues is abusive and that public schools are government-run indoctrination camps again the quotation is correct but lorenz leaves out the included video where the teacher in question has set up a preschool pride parade acclimating kids to political activism before they even know what politics is does seem to be a form of indoctrination to me most of the allegations that taylor lorenz levies against libs of tiktok follows this pattern she gets some stuff right but she purposefully leaves out the context that is the most damning to her position it is also probably important to talk about which popular libs of tiktok posts that lorenz just straight up ignores even though they too are an important part of the account's story like for example a new york state university professor's comments on adult sexual activity with babies there's a couple things to say here one is even if you are looking for a threshold let's say there's a threshold i'm making this number up but let's say it's at age eight um still that tells you that some adult child sex is permissible second the notion that it's wrong even with a one-year-old is not quite obvious to me there are reports in some cultures of grandmothers fellating their the baby boys to calm them down when when a colicky now i don't know if it's true but this is sort of widely reported as occurring in in at least one culture and it working that the grandmothers believe believe this actually works if this were to be true again i don't know it to be true if it were to be true it's hard to see what would be wrong so yeah i guess i think no i don't think there's a blanket period beyond which this is permissible if we're interested in willing participation which is the way i structured it then yeah there's a point below which people aren't willing participants in anything because they don't have intentions or they don't have the sort of mental states that allow for willing participation but no i don't i don't think it's blanket wrong at any age where a medical student who admitted to purposefully missing a person's vein and taking delight in jabbing them with the needle twice after the patient laughed at her pronoun pin or the theater that advertised the family sex show a theater show which opens up conversations around relationships offering safe and positive learning to children young people and guardians about bodies and relationships the show is advertised to families with young kids where the kids can come to learn about sex masturbation all with fully nude actors on stage some tickets to the show or you might just be wondering why we thought making it was a good idea great question um we wanted to make something that uh came at the topic of relationships and sex in a light way um in a way that would open conversations in a way that would encourage people to ask questions um and to allow for that space of vulnerability and not knowing and making mistakes um we hope that the show kind of adds to the more creative or alternative relationships in sex education that is out there at the moment in all different forms and i guess we really wanted to make the show that we wish that we'd had when we were younger and also part of our adult selves felt like or feels like they need now as well um and mostly if we know our bodies then we know our rights hello my name is ailey i'm programming and engagement manager at tobacco factory theaters i am a white female with brown blonde hair and my pronouns are she her family sex show is a fun and playful show for adults and children aged five and up it offers an honest human sex education that is feminist queer non-binary inclusive and sex positive this show can allow audiences of all ages to feel confident about their bodies their boundaries and their sexual health and we really hope to see you here this is all stuff that your average politically disengaged normie would see and immediately think what the fuck is happening over there this is some crazy deranged pedo shit it's all stuff that libs of tik tok has rightfully called out and it's all stuff that lorenz ignored in her expose because it doesn't fit the narrative that she wanted to spin and it's not like lorenz is somehow innocent either she's got a history of doing this sort of crybully back during the whole claudia conway shit show which was a part of my video about people getting more conservative as they age it turned out that it was taylor lorenz that even turned that into a story she had befriended the 15 year old daughter of kellyanne conway encouraged her to make the tik tok videos that eventually went viral and then amplified those tik toks when they came out on her own platform using them as fodder for anti-trump news articles you know when a woman who's three times the age befriends a 15 year old and then pushes her into making expose videos on her high profile parents also she can take them and turn around and boost her own career that sounds like it might be grooming and that's not the only time that taylor lorenz has done this sort of thing when she got a whiff that tech entrepreneur mark anderson used the arcelor i'm assuming that's retard in an online chat room she rushed to tweet about it for even confirming it was accurate information once it came out that it was fake news lorenz issued a correction but what the fuck dude why did she feel the need to speed run over to twitter and drop the news like a tattletale maybe the career boost of being the reporter who scalped mark anderson mattered more to her than you know actually being accurate in august 2020 lorenz published another expose this time about the company influences.com run by influencer talent agent aradna jacob the company specializes in promoting influencers and content creation houses a cancerous business model if ever heard one but lorenz claimed with no proof in her expose that jacob leaked nude images of influencers working under her and exploited them in other ways while simultaneously failing to disclose her relationship with jacob's competitor the united talent agency jacob filed suit in august 2021 against lorenz and the new york times her then employer but lorenz was already spinning up the victim machine months earlier where in reply to jacob's allegations she tweeted out on march 9 2021 it's not an exaggeration to say that the harassment and smear campaign i've had to endure over the past year has destroyed my life no one should have to go through this bitch you golden parachuted your way out of the times over to bezos's newsletter don't pretend your life is ruined it's exactly the opposite your target had the gall to fight back you didn't get your clean victory and now you're taking offense that they didn't just lay over and die and offer up their corpse for your nourishment because it turns out that this was not taylor lorenz's first rodeo a taylor lorenz posting her ells account on twitter was quickly made outlining all of the shit that she's done over the years jesus um these gimmick accounts are getting really specific aren't they here's a scatter shot of some of the dumb shit she's pulled over the years she has in no particular order falsely claimed that the judge report is harassing her which was later refuted by drudge asked people to stop investigating her public statements as a public figure saying that it makes her feel uncomfortable complained about the bourgeois billionaire elite ruling class while simultaneously acting as their foot soldier and megaphone and i think when we think about free speech we have to think about whose speech is free right dox the mother of an instagram star for apparently hating muslims while crying about how the blowback of publishing that article led to her apparently being doxed and harassed out of her apartment screeched about being stalked when her book account got followed by the stalker and how much anxiety and stress it causes her to have these boundaries crossed even though she of course showed up at libs of tiktok's house there's been a bunch of smaller data points not on the lorenz l's account to consider as well for example lorenz's investigations of the person behind libs of tiktok led to her contacting an unrelated person with the same name and that person was shortly after dog piled the internet archive has decided to exclude lorenz's twitter account from the wayback machine despite the archive's stated mission to provide universal access to all knowledge after the archive started turning up blanks lorenz's twitter account went from having 16 800 tweets to only 3500 back in january of 2022 lorenz posted a video explaining why it's bad when the media dox is a person who is a private figure without getting a statement from them a bunch of people are asking if i'm going to write about the west home caleb story no i'm on book leave i can't keep writing pieces for the new york times i literally do have a lot of deadlines but journalists who are writing about it please speak to people with experience and online harassment i'm not gonna lie i've been pretty horrified by a lot of the media coverage of this a lot of people are just aggregating some of the cruelest commentary online and whipping it all up into a news story with absolutely no comment from caleb or nuance about the situation the top story on google yesterday was literally this house beautiful story that dox's caleb puts his full name in the story zero comment from this man after this whole article gleefully encourages this online harassment and doxing campaign they literally use him to sell west elm furniture through affiliate links once again commercializing a harassment and doxing campaign i think the media needs a total wake-up call in the way that they cover online harassment and this is just the latest example of it and reporters should be adding nuance not just piling on exactly what she did to the owner of libs of tik tok um i think it's rare to see an account gain so much prominence so quickly and be shaping these narratives in such an effective way especially against trans people um so i was i mean my story was kind of long but i really wanted to make the case like why this account mattered and i think it's incredibly important you know as someone that covers the influence or industry to know who is exerting influence in in this way i mean for all we knew this could have been a foreign actor right or someone we just didn't know and so i thought hey look this account has massive power massive influence this woman is basically on an entire right-wing media tour she gave interviews to the new york post tucker all of that um and registered as a media company uh registered a trademark so yeah i wanted to i i thought it was quite important and in the public interest to find out who was running it lorenz has given multiple interviews where she talks about being harassed dox discovered and how absolutely harrowing it is an online online harassment is such a is such a it's such a misnomer um i think it's a huge problem because um you know harassment is is a is is it it's a tool to silence people especially women and people of color people from marginalized um identities for speaking out and it there's a very intentional like goal behind it it's it's obviously it's death threats and all of that and rape threats on the daily and it's not just twitter it's like every single surface right like you know my cell phone number getting out there people calling people harassing my family members stalking me like all of that is incredibly terrifying and invasive um and it's bled out into the physical world too which is even more terrifying right yeah but to me i think what what especially the media needs to understand about this in terms of protecting their own reporters is this is just a tool like harassment is a tool to kind of discredit and silence journalists and the right-wing media plays along with it you feel like any little piece of information that gets out on you will be used by the worst people on the internet to destroy your life and it's so isolating and terrifying it's horrifying i'm so sorry it's overwhelming it's really hard and after all of this ridiculous hypocrisy came to light lorenze hit up twitter once again to talk about how she is the victim in the situation because the general public didn't like how she docks the person behind libs of tiktok of course the washington post circled the wagons around her reminding me a lot frankly of the special treatment that sarah john got back in the day of course the individual behind libs of tiktok also got to speak to tucker carlson live eventually as well they wanted to intimidate me into silence um and unfortunately for them that's just never gonna happen well i'm grateful to hear that you're not intimidated were you a little surprised to see of all people taylor rens who complained bitterly when we used her name on the air several months ago who whined and cried on television because she had ptsd because people were criticizing her on the line were you surprised that it was her who came after you personally and tried to destroy your life yeah i thought that was really humorous i it added a really nice nice layer of humor on top of the whole story um and i think that the fact that it was taylor rens who is a known you know hypocrite and keen is known to dogs people the fact that it was her that was doing all this um it i think it just helped people rally with support for me have you noticed i mean i know you're not a psychiatrist or perhaps you are i don't know who you are um but are you surprised that the people who are the most deeply enmeshed in narcissism who talk about themselves the most are also capable of the greatest cruelty have you noticed that trend um yes i've noticed that a lot i've noticed it with a lot of tiktoks as well um i think it's a little bit of a trend it's not like the right was going to simply let this kind of cultural phenomenon fade away without a fight but that's not really all that important it's just libs of tiktok doing her own circuit in the media as a victim even if it's well deserved it's still part of the game lorenz's criticism is that libs of tiktok is a locus of influence in the culture war this is obviously correct but it's not entirely clear to me that libs of tiktok is somehow the aggressor or the aggrieved party in this exchange from the point of view of lorenz libs of tiktok is in the wrong because at the end of the day it's just politically expedient lorenz's political agenda is better served without a watchdog pointing out the subversion to the normies however from the point of view of libs of tiktok lorenz is in the wrong because it's also politically expedient libs of tiktok's political agenda is better served by her remaining anonymous and unimpeded in exposing subversion but how about from the point of view of the normies themselves from that position it seems to be the case that lorenz is in the wrong because the normies would undoubtedly object to a lot of the shit that libs of tiktok exposes in the counter argument that libs of tiktok just takes things out of context and that with the proper context normies would be more accepting of what's going on just doesn't seem to be true a lot of the time to me it seems like neither party is acting in line with any sort of principled anti-doxing stance libs of tiktok has no problem publishing faces names and jobs of people on her platform hoping the public's wrath will fall upon them taylor lorenz has a history of doing the same thing to advance her own career both have stretched the truth to make a point libs of tiktok is often a lot meaner than she needs to be in her snide comments that she attaches to videos meanwhile lorenz is absolutely a cry bully who plays the victim card to the max while still being cute and cheeky when those same actions benefit her where libs of tiktok might be a little bit too edgy or maybe even a little bit cruel for some people's tastes lorenz is absolutely a person who fake cries and actively seeks out victimization as a method of furthering her career but most importantly the way that each of them operates exposes a huge values difference libs of tiktok thinks of exposing people as exposing their behavior even if she misses context or gets something wrong or falls for fake news she is focused on the behaviors of these subversive prog activists what they're doing with the power over children that they currently wield but lorenz thinks of exposing people as exposing their identities there is no criticism of libs of tiktok's behavior coming out of lorenz that actually holds up because lorenz is happy to do the same thing when it's in her interest and striking all the hypocrisy from the record the only thing that she has to say about libs of tiktok is right wing bad that might be a good virtue signal but it's not a good argument where libs of tiktok points to bad behavior and says look at what these people are doing lorenz points to a hidden identity and says look at who my political opponent is it's an important distinction and to me it's at least partial evidence that the progs are scared of the effectiveness of what libs of tiktok is doing they're using the same tactic they've always leaned on for over a decade now docs intimidate defund or get fired somehow if possible in order to silence political opponents if libs of tiktok stops posting they automatically win which is why they're exploring every avenue to see it through but libs of tiktok has only grown not diminished in influence they're even being cited as an inspiration in florida's recent don't say gay law hate and homophobia is lurking right beneath the surface in american politics right now years of increasing acceptance of gays and transgenders is provoking a backlash on right-wing talk shows and in state houses that's the backdrop for this washington post piece about libs of tiktok a twitter account that shares and sometimes ridicules public posts from progressive educators and others deemed libs taylor lorenz's story revealed the identity of the conservative woman running libs of tiktok and now there's a roiling debate about her story and the ethics of it but there's no debating the influence of the libs of tiktok account it's even helped inform florida's recent parental rights law deemed the don't say gay bill by opponents which is likely one of the big reasons that taylor lorenz targeted her in the first place libs of tiktok isn't perfect sure she sometimes stretches the truth make a point because sensationalism is what makes a tweet go viral not necessarily the facts but at the end of the day she is shining a spotlight on the behavior of some pretty bad people using nothing but their own words and if i had to choose libs of tiktok is preferable to the naked opportunism and hypocrisy of taylor lorenz here's a quick addendum that i'm recording during editing guys tim pool ended up taking out a billboard in time square that says taylor lorenz docs libs of tiktok dude i bet most people walking through time square have no fucking idea what's going on why did you think this would be a good plan i mean it's funny but it's a giant waste of money but look at lorenz's reply this billboard is so undeniably idiotic it's hilarious but don't forget that these campaigns have a much darker and more violent side i'm grateful to be at a newsroom that recognizes these bad faith politically motivated attacks as a strong security team the abuse that women over 40 have to deal with this industry is horrifying make it make sense america you make it make sense taylor did you not do the exact same thing you're whining about two libs of tiktok by showing up at her home did she not suffer from the same horrifying abuse from you tim's reply was to say i'm not describing your reporting i've repeatedly said it was justified in publishing
