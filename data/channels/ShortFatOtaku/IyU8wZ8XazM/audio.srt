1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
oh god oh my god you guys i accidentally deleted my libs of tiktok file i've been saving little

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,640
tidbits of info for months as i do you know i do this if you ever watched a video or stream where

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,720
i described my work process i figured it was finally time to do the video now that the whole

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,200
taylor lorenz thing is going on went to grab my file and it was gone and the worst part is i'm

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,520
pretty sure i just mindlessly deleted it when clearing out some old stuff because it was right

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,360
near the stuff i was deleting well that's what i get for being a boomer and keeping everything on

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,840
my desktop i guess but you know what maybe it's not so bad i think i can recreate everything i

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,320
had saved up well enough let's give it a shot before we can talk about taylor lorenz we have

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,320
to talk about libs of tiktok libs of tiktok is a twitter account that began with the gimmick of

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,560
dredging up especially cringy progressive and socialist videos on tiktok and reposting them

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,440
with limited or no commentary cue me getting angry at americans using the word liberal incorrectly

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,520
for the billionth time but you know whatever we all know what's going on at the beginning libs of

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,160
tiktok functioned a lot like the various posting their ells accounts these accounts would provide

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,480
little to no commentary of their own simply reposting other people's content the idea is

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,800
that while the audience of the original posters of that content would be supportive of the message

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,920
the audience of the ells account wouldn't be the ells account would therefore act as a quasi expose

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,000
even though the content they post is entirely public and accessible to anyone and the value

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,320
would come not through adding commentary but providing the content to an audience that is

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,280
explicitly poised against it now if you were to ask the question why is reposting other people's

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,080
content bad the surface level answer is of course you're stealing content without reacting to it

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,320
that's what i bitched at on efap for three weeks in a row recently regarding hasan go watch that

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,360
if you like but while hasan outright steals content wholesale playing it for a stream while

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,880
providing no additional commentary and no citation the courts have ruled that reposting content while

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,360
adding no additional commentary with the intention that the content nonetheless be seen in a

25
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,800
different light because it's being transmitted to a different audience by a different person

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,840
constitutes a transformative use that's the whole reason that sargon won his lawsuit against akila

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,880
obviously so since this sort of thing actually isn't theft what's the next level answer to the

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,840
question why is reposting other people's content bad and the progressive answer seems to be that

29
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,720
it has to be bad because while twitter and tiktok and other platforms don't ban the original posters

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,680
of the content they have banned some of the most infamous ells accounts like trans women posting

31
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,240
their ells e-girls posting their ells and vosh fans posting their ells you call it selling out

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,480
your principles not not today not this time even though these accounts also simply reposted content

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,560
while adding only some of their own commentary they all eventually got nuked from orbit by

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,040
twitter presumably because the act of shining a spotlight on the bad behavior of members of

35
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,360
protected classes or people who are politically correct just brings too much heat down on the

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,920
platform libs of tiktok for a long time managed to ride that line of culpability perfectly and

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,200
so they didn't get a quick ban like those other accounts that i mentioned the libs of tiktok

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,880
account was previously several other gimmick accounts tweeting about kuomo at one point and

39
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,360
then as a potted plant in the white house at another but the whole reposting people's manic

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,320
rants with no comment thing went viral repeatedly so that was the gimmick that stuck but like its

41
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,040
brethren libs of tiktok would eventually fly too close to the sun though the account posted all

42
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,080
sorts of leftist content initially libs of tiktok eventually focused in on posting videos made by

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,520
teachers in the context of florida's don't say gay bills where left-leaning teachers openly mocked

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:29,360
the liberal idea of neutrality in education defied the parents of children who may have been

45
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,240
lgbt questioning hey if your parents don't love and accept you for who you are this christmas

46
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,080
fuck them i'm your parents now i'm proud of you drink some water i love you bye advocated for the

47
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,800
position of pedophiles or as they call minor attracted persons um i use the term minor

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,960
attracted person or map in the title and throughout the book for multiple reasons

49
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,960
first of all because i think it's important to use terminology for groups that members of that group

50
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:01,360
want others to use for them and map advocacy groups like before you act have advocated for

51
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,760
use of the term map they've advocated for it primarily because it's less stigmatizing than

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,280
other terms like pedophile a lot of people when they hear the term pedophile they automatically

53
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,880
assume that it means a sex offender and that isn't true and it leads to a lot of misconceptions

54
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,160
about attractions toward minors i've definitely heard the idea that you brought up though that

55
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,400
the use of the term minor attracted person suggests that it's okay to be attracted to

56
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,240
children but using a term that communicates who someone is attracted to that doesn't indicate

57
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,480
anything about the morality of that attraction here's mocking that liberal idea of neutrality

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,680
again these people don't believe in the idea of an ideology free space where ideas can be formed

59
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,400
and tested to the conservative news source that wrote an article about me that seemed really

60
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,280
focused on the flags i have in my classroom um there's a couple of things you missed actually

61
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,120
in here the first thing you missed is all 13 principles of the black lives matter movement

62
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,480
hung up at the top of my wall here because i want my students to know that flag is not just

63
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,800
a decoration but that we actually live out these principles in our everyday life you definitely

64
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,440
missed my smaller posters including this one about getting vaccinated about voting all these ones i

65
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,160
have from jay salazar that are black historical figures man you missed a lot including some of

66
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,200
the memorabilia and awards i've won as michigan teacher of the year but like go off about my flags

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,720
talking to toddlers about intersex for some reason here's a developmentally appropriate way to talk

68
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:34,080
to toddlers about bodies and gender you know the body parts that your diaper or your panties

69
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,920
or your underwear cover those are called privates everyone has privates private means that they

70
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:51,760
belong to you and only you in the front everybody has genitals but there are different kinds of

71
00:05:51,760 --> 00:06:03,280
genitals some genitals are called a penis some are called a vulva others look maybe a little bit

72
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,320
like each in some ways or kind of like neither or somewhere in between

73
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,440
people with those kind of genitals are called intersex when babies are born parents sometimes

74
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:28,240
guess their gender based on their genitals they tend to guess boy for babies who have a penis

75
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,920
and girl for babies who have a vulva sometimes parents guess wrong though and that's okay

76
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:42,400
everybody makes mistakes sometimes people whose parents guessed wrong about their gender are

77
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,960
called transgender and here's apologia for enthusiastic consent for children having sex

78
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,360
with adults also if young people are initiating sexual activities with adults or enthusiastically

79
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,160
involved we can't be effective in working with them if we assume that all such relationships

80
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,160
start with a predatory or criminally inclined inclined adult the as we're seeing in the

81
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:15,920
discussion young people bridle at being forced into this box of being seen as being the victim

82
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,720
of a predator i can actually keep this list going for a very long time literally just scroll down

83
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,080
the libs of tiktok account yourself if you want to see these clips there's got to be hundreds at

84
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,720
this point but as more and more teachers started making tiktok videos about the various ways in

85
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,040
which they were subverting the system libs of tiktok found more and more success shining a

86
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,120
spotlight on these people the account was so successful that tucker carlson gave it a shout

87
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,720
out on april 8th so in classrooms amaze.org isn't even necessary a lot of times some teachers do

88
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,520
the jobs themselves we know that in part because the hard work of a twitter account called libs of

89
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,680
tiktok which you ought to follow before it's banned if you want to know what may be happening

90
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,080
in your child's school libs of tiktok just unearthed this video shows a teacher bragging

91
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:03,360
to her students about her sex life little kids watch man y'all thought me uh teaching the children

92
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,560
about me being poly was crazy but not only that but they also know that i'm gender fluid

93
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,520
this was all well and good until october when i also explained to them that i'm pagan so i am

94
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,600
also a witch and i come into work and one of the children goes lois are you a boy you have short

95
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:33,760
hair and his sister goes no lois is a girl and a third child who's my favorite suddenly yells no

96
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:44,080
guys we've been over this lois isn't a boy or a girl lois is a witch so underneath all of this

97
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,920
needless to say and you can't say it enough is narcissism it's about me and my identity and my

98
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,360
journey it's not about you or your children teaching them anything it's about me let me talk

99
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,640
about me some more and by april 13th libs of tiktok had been brigaded and spam reported causing

100
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,600
twitter to temporarily ban the page for 12 hours the violation was hateful conduct even though

101
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
like i said before all they really did was repost and spotlight other people's stuff but the whole

102
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,040
thing really blew up with taylor lorenz the libs of tiktok account maintained its anonymity since

103
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,120
its creation as the creator has stated that they didn't want to be publicly known since they feared

104
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,400
backlash but taylor lorenz for some reason began to suspect christina pushaw the press secretary of

105
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,120
governor ron disantis as being involved with the account acting like every other scumbag reporter

106
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,040
lorenz emailed pushaw with extremely short notice hoping to be able to publish a line that would

107
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,560
read something like pushaw did not respond for comment because that looks a lot worse than it

108
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,040
actually is but pushaw did respond and also mocked lorenz publicly for the underhanded tactics

109
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,440
lorenz's reply read will note that you declined to comment on your relationship with the account

110
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,000
which was also mocked because the only relationship pushaw has with the libs of tiktok account is

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,280
liking the tweets in the end lorenz's article in the washington post would drop on april 19th in

112
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,000
which she described digging through archived versions of the libs of tiktok account or rather

113
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,040
she just took the digging that travis brown did a software developer but the research spanned back

114
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,200
to the white house potted plant gimmick the kuomo gimmick and even earlier where it was discovered

115
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,080
that the account was first known as shaya underscore ray and the owner publicly identified

116
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,280
herself as a real estate investor in brooklyn as shy array the account live tweeted from the january

117
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,000
6th capital riots claiming to have been in attendance the account's display name was chaya

118
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,760
raychick and when the website libs of tiktok.us was registered it was done so under that legal

119
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,000
name the phone number that website is registered to is also the same number attached to chaya

120
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,240
raychick's business profile in real estate when lorenz called the number she was hung up on and

121
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,080
when lorenz visited the address attached this information in la the woman at the door refused

122
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,800
to identify herself but the libs of tiktok account would later post a picture of lorenz through the

123
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,600
bars of a front door stating which of my relatives did you enjoy harassing the most at their homes

124
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,360
yesterday hey chaya is this you okay joking aside on the one hand i don't like this tendency of the

125
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,360
media to hunt down people with the incorrect political opinions and badger them at their

126
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,000
places of residence like this it reminds me of when cnn got so booty blasted they threatened

127
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,120
to dox a reddit user by the name of han asshole solo for making fun of cnn with a trump gift back

128
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,240
in the day but on the other hand keep in mind libs of tiktok does sometimes do comparable things they

129
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,320
expose the real faces and sometimes the real workplaces of the people that they put up for

130
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,560
display and libs of tiktok does it because they disagree with their politics both of them from

131
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,560
their own points of view believe they're doing the right thing and both of them consider some

132
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,280
form of doxing or public exposure or whatever you want to call it justified because of the actions

133
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,560
of their political opponents the question you have to ask though is it justified the person behind

134
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,800
the libs of tiktok account believes they're exposing groomers and saving kids and if that's

135
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,040
the case then there's probably a solid argument but taylor lorenz believes that the libs of tiktok

136
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,400
account is actively harming lgbt youth getting innocent teachers suspended and fired instituting

137
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,560
a witch hunt and if that's true that's also a solid argument against it so i guess we need to

138
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,680
find out which of these interpretations is true if either of them may be examining lorenz's claims

139
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,800
about the libs of tiktok account will help out claim one regarding tyler wren tyler wren a

140
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,160
former english teacher in oklahoma posted a video telling lgbtq kids shunned by their parents that

141
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,400
wren was proud of them and loved them it was featured on libs of tiktok last week since being

142
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,200
featured on the page wren has been barraged with harassment and death threats now this is a video

143
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,680
that we watched earlier and lorenz's description of the video's content is missing some key context

144
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,320
hey if your parents don't love and accept you for who you are this christmas fuck them i'm your

145
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,920
parents now i'm proud of you drink some water i love you bye lorenz excludes the part of the

146
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,440
clip where wren says i'm your parents now the clip's inclusion on the libs of tiktok page plays

147
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,000
into the rightest conception of the culture war to be sure but the exclamation that teachers should

148
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,400
supplant the parental role plays into the leftist conception of the culture war as well something

149
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,840
that lorenz left out in her claim claim too that libs of tiktok posted a video of a woman teaching

150
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,480
sex education to children in kentucky calling the woman in the video a predator again this isn't

151
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,040
entirely accurate here's what the actual thread looks like the first post reads this woman is

152
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,120
running a sexy summer camp for children in kentucky she says she thinks it's good for

153
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,080
toddlers to masturbate with this accompanying video clip that's how we should you know like get

154
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,080
down with yourself explore your own body masturbation is really healthy and i recommend it to people of

155
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:24,560
all ages all ages as soon as my nephews could talk they were doing that that's what they were doing

156
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,600
kids touch themselves kids start to ask questions and we teach them the language for their bodies

157
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,960
right that's your nose touch your nose show aunt t you can touch your nose but my sister's not

158
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,400
saying that when they're tugging at their penis right but it feels good right we have to learn

159
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,440
ways to talk to young people about this so that they know how to explore their body consensually

160
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,080
so that it's not in public right we don't want people exploring their bodies in public that's

161
00:13:52,080 --> 00:14:00,080
not consensual but exploring your body at any age grandma's grandpa's all of us need to be exploring

162
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,800
our body the second post reads i work with the school systems my job was not to teach sex ed i

163
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,440
try to figure out ways to work this into the schools this woman is a predator so lorenz was

164
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,960
correct libs of tiktok did indeed call her a predator but lorenz left out all of the context

165
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,600
of exactly what was happening at this kentucky sexy summer camp and by the way the camp was

166
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,000
independently investigated separate from the whole libs of tiktok story by chris rufo writing for

167
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,680
city journal where he describes a non-profit coalition called sexy sex ed which organized a

168
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,400
series of sexy summer camp events targeted towards minors that included lessons on

169
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:40,880
sex liberation gender exploration bdsm being a sex worker self-managed abortions and sexual

170
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,360
activity while using licit and illicit drugs sexy sex ed's publicly available event calendar lists

171
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,800
the following classes and workshops sex with me self-pleasure workshop gender diversity let's talk

172
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:00,880
about sex sexy trans sex ed the three p's pee poop pee poop and pleasure sex on drugs and eugenics

173
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,920
and appalachia keep in mind this is a camp for teenagers going as young as 13 and hey while i

174
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,240
might have been jerking off at 13 women like this were the last thing on my mind as i was doing it

175
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,280
claim three that libs of tiktok was leaning hard into groomer discourse calling for any teacher

176
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,520
who comes out as gay to their students to be fired on the spot and yes that's actually exactly what

177
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:26,000
the tweet says here is the accompanying video so today i came out to my students here's a little

178
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,600
story so in my fifth grade classroom we have a unit where we talk about identity and how

179
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,280
people identify and we talk about traditions and customs that are handed down from ancestors

180
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:46,800
and things like that so i modeled for the kids today how i identify myself and in doing so i

181
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:55,120
told them that i identify as a mom as a sister and a daughter as a teacher i said and i identify as

182
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:02,240
a cis woman and i explained what that was because they had no idea what i was talking about and then

183
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:10,160
i said and i identify as gay in my 17 years of teaching i've never come out to my kids before

184
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,920
and i was so nervous to even say it out loud to them but they didn't even bat an eye it was really

185
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,960
awesome when i was in grade five that year was the first sex ed course we had and it dealt with

186
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,600
physical biological reproduction how it works in plants and bugs and various types of animals and

187
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,960
humans the social component of sex and puberty waited until grades six and seven what this

188
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,160
person is describing is not only the social component of sex but identity from an intersectional

189
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,000
framework and the intersectional lens is inherently political i didn't get into this

190
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,560
type of stuff until first year gender studies at university to me this seems like it's too much for

191
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,760
grade five it's not abusive it's not grooming but certainly inappropriate for the age range claim

192
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,240
four that libs of tiktok pushed the false conspiracy theory that schools were installing

193
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,920
litter boxes and bathrooms for students who identify as cats and yep i don't even need to

194
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,560
confirm this one i went over this in a weekly set myself that one felt a bit too funny to be true

195
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,360
no matter how accepted furries might be nowadays this is an l for libs of tiktok they got this one

196
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,880
wrong and claim five that libs of tiktok thinks learning about lgbt identities and issues is

197
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,680
abusive and that public schools are government-run indoctrination camps again the quotation is

198
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,160
correct but lorenz leaves out the included video where the teacher in question has set up a

199
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:35,760
preschool pride parade

200
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,240
acclimating kids to political activism before they even know what politics is does seem to be a form

201
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,760
of indoctrination to me most of the allegations that taylor lorenz levies against libs of tiktok

202
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,800
follows this pattern she gets some stuff right but she purposefully leaves out the context that

203
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,280
is the most damning to her position it is also probably important to talk about which popular

204
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,360
libs of tiktok posts that lorenz just straight up ignores even though they too are an important part

205
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,040
of the account's story like for example a new york state university professor's comments on

206
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:33,200
adult sexual activity with babies there's a couple things to say here one is even if you are looking

207
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,040
for a threshold let's say there's a threshold i'm making this number up but let's say it's at age

208
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:45,040
eight um still that tells you that some adult child sex is permissible second the notion that

209
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,440
it's wrong even with a one-year-old is not quite obvious to me there are reports in some cultures

210
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,200
of grandmothers fellating their the baby boys to calm them down when when a colicky now i don't

211
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,600
know if it's true but this is sort of widely reported as occurring in in at least one culture

212
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,240
and it working that the grandmothers believe believe this actually works if this were to be

213
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,040
true again i don't know it to be true if it were to be true it's hard to see what would be wrong

214
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:19,520
so yeah i guess i think no i don't think there's a blanket period beyond which this is permissible

215
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,880
if we're interested in willing participation which is the way i structured it then yeah there's

216
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,240
a point below which people aren't willing participants in anything because they don't

217
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,040
have intentions or they don't have the sort of mental states that allow for willing participation

218
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,760
but no i don't i don't think it's blanket wrong at any age where a medical student who admitted

219
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,400
to purposefully missing a person's vein and taking delight in jabbing them with the needle

220
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,360
twice after the patient laughed at her pronoun pin or the theater that advertised the family

221
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,440
sex show a theater show which opens up conversations around relationships offering

222
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,240
safe and positive learning to children young people and guardians about bodies and relationships

223
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,560
the show is advertised to families with young kids where the kids can come to learn about sex

224
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,920
masturbation all with fully nude actors on stage

225
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,360
some tickets to the show or you might just be wondering why we thought making it was a good

226
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:43,200
idea great question um we wanted to make something that uh came at the topic of relationships and sex

227
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,800
in a light way um in a way that would open conversations in a way that would encourage

228
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,440
people to ask questions um and to allow for that space of vulnerability and not knowing and making

229
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:02,560
mistakes um we hope that the show kind of adds to the more creative or alternative relationships

230
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:08,400
in sex education that is out there at the moment in all different forms and i guess we really

231
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,040
wanted to make the show that we wish that we'd had when we were younger and also part of our

232
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:21,200
adult selves felt like or feels like they need now as well um and mostly if we know our bodies then

233
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,320
we know our rights hello my name is ailey i'm programming and engagement manager at

234
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:33,520
tobacco factory theaters i am a white female with brown blonde hair and my pronouns are she her

235
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,840
family sex show is a fun and playful show for adults and children aged five and up it offers

236
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:47,520
an honest human sex education that is feminist queer non-binary inclusive and sex positive this

237
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,280
show can allow audiences of all ages to feel confident about their bodies their boundaries

238
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,400
and their sexual health and we really hope to see you here this is all stuff that your average

239
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,720
politically disengaged normie would see and immediately think what the fuck is happening

240
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,920
over there this is some crazy deranged pedo shit it's all stuff that libs of tik tok has rightfully

241
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,280
called out and it's all stuff that lorenz ignored in her expose because it doesn't fit the narrative

242
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,000
that she wanted to spin and it's not like lorenz is somehow innocent either she's got a history

243
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,640
of doing this sort of crybully back during the whole claudia conway shit show which was a part

244
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,200
of my video about people getting more conservative as they age it turned out that it was taylor

245
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,640
lorenz that even turned that into a story she had befriended the 15 year old daughter of kellyanne

246
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,720
conway encouraged her to make the tik tok videos that eventually went viral and then amplified

247
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,360
those tik toks when they came out on her own platform using them as fodder for anti-trump news

248
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,960
articles you know when a woman who's three times the age befriends a 15 year old and then pushes

249
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,400
her into making expose videos on her high profile parents also she can take them and turn around

250
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,280
and boost her own career that sounds like it might be grooming and that's not the only time that taylor

251
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,160
lorenz has done this sort of thing when she got a whiff that tech entrepreneur mark anderson used

252
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,800
the arcelor i'm assuming that's retard in an online chat room she rushed to tweet about it

253
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,560
for even confirming it was accurate information once it came out that it was fake news lorenz

254
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,040
issued a correction but what the fuck dude why did she feel the need to speed run over to twitter

255
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,360
and drop the news like a tattletale maybe the career boost of being the reporter who scalped

256
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,440
mark anderson mattered more to her than you know actually being accurate in august 2020 lorenz

257
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,640
published another expose this time about the company influences.com run by influencer talent

258
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,240
agent aradna jacob the company specializes in promoting influencers and content creation houses

259
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,960
a cancerous business model if ever heard one but lorenz claimed with no proof in her expose

260
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,000
that jacob leaked nude images of influencers working under her and exploited them in other ways

261
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,400
while simultaneously failing to disclose her relationship with jacob's competitor the united

262
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,920
talent agency jacob filed suit in august 2021 against lorenz and the new york times her then

263
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,080
employer but lorenz was already spinning up the victim machine months earlier where in reply to

264
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,280
jacob's allegations she tweeted out on march 9 2021 it's not an exaggeration to say that the

265
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,000
harassment and smear campaign i've had to endure over the past year has destroyed my life no one

266
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,240
should have to go through this bitch you golden parachuted your way out of the times over to

267
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,480
bezos's newsletter don't pretend your life is ruined it's exactly the opposite your target had

268
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,120
the gall to fight back you didn't get your clean victory and now you're taking offense that they

269
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,000
didn't just lay over and die and offer up their corpse for your nourishment because it turns out

270
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,880
that this was not taylor lorenz's first rodeo a taylor lorenz posting her ells account on twitter

271
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,400
was quickly made outlining all of the shit that she's done over the years jesus um these gimmick

272
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,240
accounts are getting really specific aren't they here's a scatter shot of some of the dumb shit

273
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,480
she's pulled over the years she has in no particular order falsely claimed that the judge

274
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,040
report is harassing her which was later refuted by drudge asked people to stop investigating her

275
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,360
public statements as a public figure saying that it makes her feel uncomfortable complained about

276
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,480
the bourgeois billionaire elite ruling class while simultaneously acting as their foot soldier and

277
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,200
megaphone and i think when we think about free speech we have to think about whose speech is

278
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,880
free right dox the mother of an instagram star for apparently hating muslims while crying about how

279
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,320
the blowback of publishing that article led to her apparently being doxed and harassed out of

280
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,760
her apartment screeched about being stalked when her book account got followed by the stalker and

281
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,960
how much anxiety and stress it causes her to have these boundaries crossed even though she of course

282
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,120
showed up at libs of tiktok's house there's been a bunch of smaller data points not on the lorenz

283
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,600
l's account to consider as well for example lorenz's investigations of the person behind

284
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,920
libs of tiktok led to her contacting an unrelated person with the same name and that person was

285
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,480
shortly after dog piled the internet archive has decided to exclude lorenz's twitter account from

286
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,400
the wayback machine despite the archive's stated mission to provide universal access to all

287
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,880
knowledge after the archive started turning up blanks lorenz's twitter account went from having

288
00:25:52,880 --> 00:26:00,240
16 800 tweets to only 3500 back in january of 2022 lorenz posted a video explaining why it's

289
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,920
bad when the media dox is a person who is a private figure without getting a statement from them

290
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,920
a bunch of people are asking if i'm going to write about the west home caleb story no i'm on book

291
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,720
leave i can't keep writing pieces for the new york times i literally do have a lot of deadlines

292
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,440
but journalists who are writing about it please speak to people with experience and online

293
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,920
harassment i'm not gonna lie i've been pretty horrified by a lot of the media coverage of this

294
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,120
a lot of people are just aggregating some of the cruelest commentary online and whipping it all

295
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,160
up into a news story with absolutely no comment from caleb or nuance about the situation the top

296
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,800
story on google yesterday was literally this house beautiful story that dox's caleb puts his full

297
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:44,720
name in the story zero comment from this man after this whole article gleefully encourages this online

298
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,840
harassment and doxing campaign they literally use him to sell west elm furniture through affiliate

299
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:56,880
links once again commercializing a harassment and doxing campaign i think the media needs a

300
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,400
total wake-up call in the way that they cover online harassment and this is just the latest

301
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,840
example of it and reporters should be adding nuance not just piling on exactly what she did

302
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,920
to the owner of libs of tik tok um i think it's rare to see an account gain so much prominence

303
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,720
so quickly and be shaping these narratives in such an effective way especially against trans

304
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,600
people um so i was i mean my story was kind of long but i really wanted to make the case like

305
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,600
why this account mattered and i think it's incredibly important you know as someone that

306
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,120
covers the influence or industry to know who is exerting influence in in this way i mean for all

307
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,080
we knew this could have been a foreign actor right or someone we just didn't know and so i thought hey

308
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,160
look this account has massive power massive influence this woman is basically on an entire

309
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,800
right-wing media tour she gave interviews to the new york post tucker all of that um and registered

310
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,080
as a media company uh registered a trademark so yeah i wanted to i i thought it was quite

311
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,880
important and in the public interest to find out who was running it lorenz has given multiple

312
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,160
interviews where she talks about being harassed dox discovered and how absolutely harrowing it is

313
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,840
an online online harassment is such a is such a it's such a misnomer um i think it's a huge

314
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,400
problem because um you know harassment is is a is is it it's a tool to silence people especially

315
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,240
women and people of color people from marginalized um identities for speaking out and it there's a

316
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,040
very intentional like goal behind it it's it's obviously it's death threats and all of that and

317
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,320
rape threats on the daily and it's not just twitter it's like every single surface right like you know

318
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,560
my cell phone number getting out there people calling people harassing my family members

319
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,240
stalking me like all of that is incredibly terrifying and invasive um and it's bled out

320
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,240
into the physical world too which is even more terrifying right yeah but to me i think what

321
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,400
what especially the media needs to understand about this in terms of protecting their own

322
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,000
reporters is this is just a tool like harassment is a tool to kind of discredit and silence

323
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,920
journalists and the right-wing media plays along with it you feel like any little piece of

324
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:05,760
information that gets out on you will be used by the worst people on the internet to destroy your

325
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:18,000
life and it's so isolating and terrifying it's horrifying i'm so sorry it's overwhelming it's

326
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,960
really hard and after all of this ridiculous hypocrisy came to light lorenze hit up twitter

327
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,680
once again to talk about how she is the victim in the situation because the general public didn't

328
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,000
like how she docks the person behind libs of tiktok of course the washington post circled

329
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,400
the wagons around her reminding me a lot frankly of the special treatment that sarah john got back

330
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,880
in the day of course the individual behind libs of tiktok also got to speak to tucker carlson live

331
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,280
eventually as well they wanted to intimidate me into silence um and unfortunately for them

332
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,560
that's just never gonna happen well i'm grateful to hear that you're not intimidated were you a

333
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,600
little surprised to see of all people taylor rens who complained bitterly when we used her name on

334
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,320
the air several months ago who whined and cried on television because she had ptsd because people

335
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,800
were criticizing her on the line were you surprised that it was her who came after you

336
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:15,840
personally and tried to destroy your life yeah i thought that was really humorous i it added a

337
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,280
really nice nice layer of humor on top of the whole story um and i think that the fact that

338
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:28,560
it was taylor rens who is a known you know hypocrite and keen is known to dogs people

339
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,880
the fact that it was her that was doing all this um it i think it just helped people

340
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,280
rally with support for me have you noticed i mean i know you're not a psychiatrist or perhaps you

341
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:44,720
are i don't know who you are um but are you surprised that the people who are the most

342
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,960
deeply enmeshed in narcissism who talk about themselves the most are also capable of the

343
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,520
greatest cruelty have you noticed that trend um yes i've noticed that a lot i've noticed it with

344
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,640
a lot of tiktoks as well um i think it's a little bit of a trend it's not like the right was going

345
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,120
to simply let this kind of cultural phenomenon fade away without a fight but that's not really

346
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,280
all that important it's just libs of tiktok doing her own circuit in the media as a victim even if

347
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,600
it's well deserved it's still part of the game lorenz's criticism is that libs of tiktok is a

348
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,840
locus of influence in the culture war this is obviously correct but it's not entirely clear

349
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,400
to me that libs of tiktok is somehow the aggressor or the aggrieved party in this exchange from the

350
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,400
point of view of lorenz libs of tiktok is in the wrong because at the end of the day it's just

351
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,880
politically expedient lorenz's political agenda is better served without a watchdog pointing out the

352
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,200
subversion to the normies however from the point of view of libs of tiktok lorenz is in the wrong

353
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,440
because it's also politically expedient libs of tiktok's political agenda is better served by her

354
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,000
remaining anonymous and unimpeded in exposing subversion but how about from the point of view

355
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,240
of the normies themselves from that position it seems to be the case that lorenz is in the wrong

356
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,720
because the normies would undoubtedly object to a lot of the shit that libs of tiktok exposes

357
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,040
in the counter argument that libs of tiktok just takes things out of context and that with the

358
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,080
proper context normies would be more accepting of what's going on just doesn't seem to be true a lot

359
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,120
of the time to me it seems like neither party is acting in line with any sort of principled

360
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,320
anti-doxing stance libs of tiktok has no problem publishing faces names and jobs of people on her

361
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,800
platform hoping the public's wrath will fall upon them taylor lorenz has a history of doing the same

362
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,760
thing to advance her own career both have stretched the truth to make a point libs of tiktok is often

363
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,560
a lot meaner than she needs to be in her snide comments that she attaches to videos meanwhile

364
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,680
lorenz is absolutely a cry bully who plays the victim card to the max while still being cute and

365
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,720
cheeky when those same actions benefit her where libs of tiktok might be a little bit too edgy or

366
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,360
maybe even a little bit cruel for some people's tastes lorenz is absolutely a person who fake

367
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,400
cries and actively seeks out victimization as a method of furthering her career but most

368
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,680
importantly the way that each of them operates exposes a huge values difference libs of tiktok

369
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,400
thinks of exposing people as exposing their behavior even if she misses context or gets

370
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,200
something wrong or falls for fake news she is focused on the behaviors of these subversive prog

371
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,440
activists what they're doing with the power over children that they currently wield but lorenz

372
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,240
thinks of exposing people as exposing their identities there is no criticism of libs of tiktok's

373
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,480
behavior coming out of lorenz that actually holds up because lorenz is happy to do the same thing

374
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,480
when it's in her interest and striking all the hypocrisy from the record the only thing that

375
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,600
she has to say about libs of tiktok is right wing bad that might be a good virtue signal but it's

376
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,640
not a good argument where libs of tiktok points to bad behavior and says look at what these people

377
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,520
are doing lorenz points to a hidden identity and says look at who my political opponent is it's an

378
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,280
important distinction and to me it's at least partial evidence that the progs are scared of

379
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,680
the effectiveness of what libs of tiktok is doing they're using the same tactic they've always leaned

380
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,120
on for over a decade now docs intimidate defund or get fired somehow if possible in order to silence

381
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,440
political opponents if libs of tiktok stops posting they automatically win which is why

382
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,960
they're exploring every avenue to see it through but libs of tiktok has only grown not diminished

383
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,160
in influence they're even being cited as an inspiration in florida's recent don't say gay

384
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:11,120
law hate and homophobia is lurking right beneath the surface in american politics right now years

385
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,720
of increasing acceptance of gays and transgenders is provoking a backlash on right-wing talk shows

386
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,960
and in state houses that's the backdrop for this washington post piece about libs of tiktok a

387
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,400
twitter account that shares and sometimes ridicules public posts from progressive educators and others

388
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:33,920
deemed libs taylor lorenz's story revealed the identity of the conservative woman

389
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:39,120
running libs of tiktok and now there's a roiling debate about her story and the ethics of it

390
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,640
but there's no debating the influence of the libs of tiktok account it's even helped inform

391
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:50,240
florida's recent parental rights law deemed the don't say gay bill by opponents which is likely

392
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,880
one of the big reasons that taylor lorenz targeted her in the first place libs of tiktok isn't perfect

393
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,880
sure she sometimes stretches the truth make a point because sensationalism is what makes a

394
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,000
tweet go viral not necessarily the facts but at the end of the day she is shining a spotlight on

395
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,400
the behavior of some pretty bad people using nothing but their own words and if i had to choose

396
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,720
libs of tiktok is preferable to the naked opportunism and hypocrisy of taylor lorenz

397
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,800
here's a quick addendum that i'm recording during editing guys tim pool ended up taking out a

398
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,640
billboard in time square that says taylor lorenz docs libs of tiktok dude i bet most people walking

399
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,640
through time square have no fucking idea what's going on why did you think this would be a good

400
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,160
plan i mean it's funny but it's a giant waste of money but look at lorenz's reply this billboard

401
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,200
is so undeniably idiotic it's hilarious but don't forget that these campaigns have a much

402
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,840
darker and more violent side i'm grateful to be at a newsroom that recognizes these bad faith

403
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,320
politically motivated attacks as a strong security team the abuse that women over 40 have to deal

404
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,640
with this industry is horrifying make it make sense america you make it make sense taylor did

405
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,800
you not do the exact same thing you're whining about two libs of tiktok by showing up at her

406
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,760
home did she not suffer from the same horrifying abuse from you tim's reply was to say i'm not

407
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,760
describing your reporting i've repeatedly said it was justified in publishing a name we can argue

408
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,640
the merits i'm calling you out for lying when you and washington post denied linking to private

409
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,880
details you publish libs of tiktok's private address just own it i'm glad to hear you're

410
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,800
not upset and your friends and fans are also happy it's the way it should be you make a statement

411
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,360
i can test it we all made our points heard you on cnn me and time square now we move on completely

412
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,960
reasonable take tit for tat you both get the spotlight shown on you you hash it out welcome

413
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,560
to the public sphere of course taylor's not interested in any kind of mutual back and forth

414
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,880
she thinks that she has a license to simply harass whoever she wants and they shouldn't be able to

415
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,600
speak back my family and friends aren't happy they've been subject to non-stop stream of hateful

416
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:44,080
attacks doxing and violent attacks driven by this baseless campaign i'm happy to hear you're moving

417
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,400
on oh fuck right off you are loving this shit this is the most traction your career has ever

418
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,640
gotten you are going to milk this victimhood into a promotion and we both know it you're over here

419
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,040
whining over getting the clap back you deserve you are a crybully and i don't care how many

420
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,160
crocodile tears you shed over having done to you what you have built a career out of doing to others

421
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,920
you've been doxed you've been threatened you've been harassed by tucker carlson just for calling

423
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:20,480
every single social tie i had severe ptsd from this i i contemplated suicide it got really bad

424
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,680

slave known as libs of tiktok i'm libs of tiktok tiktok tiktok tiktok i'm lives of tiktok tiktok
