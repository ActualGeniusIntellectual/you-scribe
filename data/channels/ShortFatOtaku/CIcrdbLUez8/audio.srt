1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
If you've watched my content, it should be no surprise to you that I don't actually

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,640
consider myself to be a die-hard Trump fan.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,120
I have said consistently that I'm neutral on him.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,920
I think, if I were an American, I would probably vote for him.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,480
And I supported Bernie back in 2016.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,760
But really, I was hoping for Tulsi.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,580
However, the reason that people like me, the non-communist, non-socialist left, you know,

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,480
the social liberal that wants democracy and capitalism intact, but doesn't mind the

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,960
idea of a social safety net funded by taxation, that kind of person.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,360
People like me generally gravitate towards Trump because the left has ceded the sensible

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,360
center left.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,660
It's either socialists or neoliberal, and people like me don't like either.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,380
And the right is no longer the religious right, now it's the populist right.

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,240
And they are taking that center ground.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,780
They're taking up those issues that the left abandoned.

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,880
That doesn't mean that I think Trump's perfect.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
Far from it.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,120
Because there does seem to be, for some reason, this preconception that I'm a Trump superfan.

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,200
I'm not.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,040
And here are the things he's done that I really don't like.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,680
For example, I think Trump's recent debate performance was only so-so.

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,160
I think it could have done a lot better.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,520
He bullied Biden, he got him flustered, which is what he had to do.

24
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,640
But he didn't let Biden expand on his own mistakes a little bit more.

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,640
And he certainly fell into that white supremacist trap.

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,120
But are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say

27
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,520
that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities,

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,520
as we saw in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland?

29
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,560
Are you prepared to specifically do it?

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,120
I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing.

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,720
What are you saying?

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,080
I'm willing to do anything.

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
I want to see peace.

34
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Then do it, sir.

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Say it.

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,080
Do it.

37
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
What do you want to call him?

38
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
What do you want to call him?

39
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
Give me a name.

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Give me a name.

41
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
What would you like me to condemn?

42
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
Proud Boys.

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,440
Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.

44
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
But I'll tell you what.

45
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,840
I'll tell you what.

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,720
Somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left, because this is not a right

47
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
wing problem.

48
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,520
This is a left wing problem.

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
This is a left wing problem.

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,080
Antifa is an idea, not an organization.

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
You gotta be kidding me.

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,880
I know it's a product of his speaking style, because he's kind of bombastic and out there.

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,120
But when asked to directly repudiate white supremacists, he should have just done it,

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,320
because he's done it before, many times.

55
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:30,960
We've got the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally.

56
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,560
Racism is evil.

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:40,260
And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis,

58
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,200
white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,540
as Americans.

60
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:56,520
In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy.

61
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,660
And yes, that means you shouldn't have to keep doing it, but this is a national debate.

62
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,620
If there was one time you were going to repeat yourself again, this would be the time.

63
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:11,500
I also think that sometimes Trump's chaotic nature makes dealing with America's enemies

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,180
a bit too unpredictable.

65
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,780
For example, this is from 2018, remember this?

66
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,300
Donald Trump denies discussing assassination of Syria's Assad.

67
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,000
US President Donald Trump has denied assertions by prominent journalist Bob Woodward in his

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,220
new book that he ordered the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

69
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,500
Mr. Trump said the idea was never even discussed with defense officials.

70
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,240
Defense Secretary James Mattis also denied words attributed to him in Woodward's book.

71
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,460
The book says Mr. Trump had ordered the Pentagon to arrange the assassination of the Syrian

72
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:49,540
president after a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017 that was blamed on the Syrian

73
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,540
government.

74
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,140
Let's effin kill him, let's go in, let's kill the effin lot of him.

75
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,540
Mr. Trump is reported to have told Mr. Mattis.

76
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,700
Of course, at the time everyone said there was no way this is the case, this is just

77
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,420
somebody writing yet another book where Trump says some wild off the cuff thing, there's

78
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,180
been like a dozen of these that have come out over the past four years.

79
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,340
And Trump himself said the same thing in an interview, question, is Bob Woodward a liar

80
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,340
sir?

81
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,340
Do you believe Bob Woodward is lying?

82
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,080
President Trump, oh yeah sure, he's lying, sure.

83
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,980
The book, you mean on the book?

84
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,980
Yes sir.

85
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,380
The book means nothing, it's a work of fiction.

86
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,840
Already General Mattis has come out very very strongly, and I think you know General Mattis,

87
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,500
he does what he wants to do, he's a very independent guy, he was insulted by the remarks that were

88
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,780
attributed to him, and he came up with a very strong statement, I assume you read it,

89
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,580
I hope you read it last night.

90
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,900
Except a couple of weeks ago, Donald Trump completely flipped on that story, and said

91
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,380
that he actually wanted to kill President Bashar al-Assad, and that it was General Mattis

92
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,980
that prevented him from doing so.

93
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,680
And is it true that after Assad gassed children for the second time, that it was you that

94
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,780
wanted to take out Assad, that you had a good side on him, and that it was General Mattis

95
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,220
who talked you out of it, and if it is true do you regret not taking him out, being that

96
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,620
he's not, because he is a mass murderer?

97
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,860
I would have rather taken him out, I had it all set, Mattis didn't want to do it.

98
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,820
Mattis was a highly overrated general, and I let him go, he worked for Obama, he got

99
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:21,340
fired by Obama also, and I thought that was maybe just a fluke, maybe they had different

100
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,740
views, and he wanted the job very badly, I gave him the job, I didn't like him, I fired

101
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:33,260
him, and to me he was a terrible general, he was a bad leader, and he wasn't doing the

102
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:38,820
job with ISIS, he was not doing the job in Syria or Iraq with respect to ISIS, I got

103
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,740
rid of ISIS after he was gone, I did a great job on ISIS, 100% of the caliphate.

104
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,860
Transgender could be defined out of existence under Trump administration, that headline

105
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:54,380
is a bit hyperbolic, but I personally still do not want to see any rollback of trans rights

106
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,340
or gay marriage or anything like that.

107
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,340
The Trump administration is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological immutable

108
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,800
condition determined by genitalia at birth, the most drastic move yet in a government-wide

109
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,540
effort to rollback recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil

110
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,540
rights law.

111
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,140
Now for even the most right-leaning of you, you have to understand, gender is not the

112
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,120
same thing as biological sex, gender is not the biological immutable condition determined

113
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,120
by genitalia at birth, that's sex.

114
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,080
Gender is the social role, now I'm not going to be some kind of idiot and say that you

115
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,560
can change your biological sex, no you can't, I'm also not going to say that there's no

116
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,460
link between biological sex and gender role, there very clearly is, but they are not the

117
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,400
same thing, and I do think that it's just another part of the freedom of the individual

118
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,300
to choose to take on a different gender role than the one that normally goes with your

119
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,600
biological sex.

120
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,400
Nobody is obligated to treat you that way, but then again, nobody is obligated to treat

121
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,040
you anyway, because being rude is not illegal, nor should it be.

122
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,760
A series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened the legal concept of gender in federal

123
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:12,440
programs including in education and healthcare, recognizing gender largely as an individual's

124
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,600
choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth.

125
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,360
Well frankly, both of these are wrong, aren't they?

126
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,880
Gender is not determined by the sex assigned at birth, gender is a related concept but

127
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,040
it is its own thing, however gender is not the individual choice, because people don't

128
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,000
choose to be trans, unless the intersectional logic has changed over the past 15 years,

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,800
trans women may be women but not simply because they identify as them, and to be honest the

130
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,640
Trump administration's rollback of this seems to be conflating sex and gender, and in the

131
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,520
same vein we have transgender health protections reversed by the Trump administration, this

132
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,000
happened a little over two months ago.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,040
I was actually on board with him removing trans people from the military, at least in

134
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,720
active combat roles, because in situations where there may be fighting, there may be

135
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,400
a lack of supply lines or something, there's no guarantee they're going to get their squishy

136
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,760
skittles on time, and people who have to take medication are generally not allowed in those

137
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
roles.

138
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,160
But for me, this is too far.

139
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,900
The Trump administration on Friday finalized a rule that would remove non-discrimination

140
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,360
protections for LGBTQ people when it comes to healthcare and health insurance.

141
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,200
The new rule defines sex discrimination as only applying when someone faces discrimination

142
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,780
for being female or male and does not protect people from discrimination on the basis of

143
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,560
sexual orientation or gender identity.

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,320
Supporters of the new rule say that this is a necessary reversal of Obama era executive

145
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,860
overreach and will reduce confusion about the legal meaning of sex discrimination.

146
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,540
Critics argue that the rule could further harm an already vulnerable group, transgender

147
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,720
people in the midst of a pandemic, and the historic uprest spurred by the killing of

148
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
George Floyd.

149
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,020
I can't help but wonder if the timing of this rule is by design so that this is something

150
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,640
people won't pay attention to.

151
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,220
And here's what the rule does.

152
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,700
The rule focuses on non-discrimination protections laid out in section 1557 of the Affordable

153
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,960
Care Act.

154
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,460
That federal law established that it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, color,

155
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,900
national origin, sex, age, or disability in certain health programs and activities.

156
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,920
In 2016 an Obama era rule explained that the protections regarding sex encompassed those

157
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,000
based on gender identity which it defined as male, female, neither, or a combination

158
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,320
of male and female.

159
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,840
And of course the Trump administration said, we're going back to the plain meaning of those

160
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,160
terms which is based on biological sex.

161
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,720
Now I get it because this is actually a problem with the wording of the Affordable Care Act.

162
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,640
The Affordable Care Act protected based on race, color, national origin, sex, age, or

163
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,640
disability.

164
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,540
It did not protect for sexuality or gender identity.

165
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,540
And Obama simply decided to define the word sex as including sexuality and gender identity

166
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,100
which it clearly doesn't.

167
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,360
But the solution here does leave those people open to potential discrimination.

168
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,140
And frankly this rule reversal shouldn't have been done until section 1557 of the Affordable

169
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,560
Care Act was changed to actually include gender identity and sexuality.

170
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Simple as that.

171
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,220
And then of course we've got this clip.

172
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,100
I remember this guy, Welche, he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas and he

173
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,680
went down.

174
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,380
He didn't, he was down.

175
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,040
My knee, my knee.

176
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Nobody cared.

177
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
These guys didn't care.

178
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
They moved him aside.

179
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,820
And they just walked right through.

180
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,540
It was like, it was the most beautiful thing.

181
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,460
No because after we take all that crap for weeks and weeks, they would take this crap

182
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,700
and then you finally see men get up there and go right through.

183
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,080
Wasn't it really a beautiful sight?

184
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,280
Of course he's talking about Ali Welche, a reporter at MSNBC.

185
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,920
You'll probably recognize this guy as the idiot who was on the scene saying that the

186
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,720
protests were mostly peaceful as a fire raged around him.

187
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:58,400
I want to be clear in how I characterize this, this is mostly a protest, it is not generally

188
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,880
speaking unruly.

189
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,640
Yes he is America's bagdaddy Bob.

190
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,400
But frankly, whatever you think about the state of journalism right now, and it is pretty

191
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
shit.

192
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,680
Or about MSNBC, or about Ali Welche himself.

193
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,840
The journalists that are covering the riots, especially the journalists that are covering

194
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,760
the peaceful protests, should not be attacked by the cops.

195
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,200
I get it, you have the fog of war, you don't know what's going on, you might not know who's

196
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,120
who, people get caught up in the crossfire, these things happen.

197
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,880
But man, it's not something to jeer about.

198
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,280
Yes we get it, journalists are shit.

199
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,240
We have to be better than them.

200
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,360
Trump won't commit to a peaceful post-election transfer of power.

201
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,960
In a response to a question the president complained about mail-in ballots and said

202
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,080
there won't be a transfer frankly, there will be a continuation.

203
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,920
In my opinion this is absolutely unconscionable.

204
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Every election that I can remember, up until 2016, the candidates said, regardless of who

205
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,380
won, yes we will of course respect the outcome of the election.

206
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,920
And in 2016 Hillary herself said it, until she lost, and then suddenly the left rioted

207
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,360
for 4 years.

208
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,240
But again, we have to be better than them.

209
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,820
If Trump loses the election, fair and square, he has to go.

210
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:16,800
In that situation, any attempt by him to hang on to the office would be monstrously authoritarian.

211
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,060
Asking whether he would commit here today for a peaceful transfer of power after the

212
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,240
November election, Mr. Trump demurred, passing on a chance to call for a calm and orderly

213
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
election process.

214
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,480
We're going to have to see what happens, he told a reporter.

215
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,520
You know that I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster.

216
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,920
Get rid of the ballots and you'll be very peaceful, there won't be a transfer frankly,

217
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,040
there will be a continuation.

218
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,200
That was an apparent reference to mail-in ballots, which for months he has railed against.

219
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,480
And no article not without evidence, there has definitely been some evidence of ballots

220
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,320
disappearing and stuff like that.

221
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,960
But still, what he has to say is, if I lose, if the evidence has been looked over, and

222
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,320
I've lost fair and square, I will step down.

223
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,260
His opponents already imagine him to be a tyrant.

224
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,460
The winning move, as always, is to beat them on their level.

225
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,600
To directly address and rebuke their claims.

226
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,660
And just like with the debate question, his Trumpisms, I guess we'll call them, often

227
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,320
do him more harm than good.

228
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,680
And of course, probably most infamously, there was his clearing of Lafayette Square.

229
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,480
From what I understand, Lafayette Square is kind of like Canada's Parliament Hill, or

230
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,960
the UK's Speaker's Corner, where people show up and protest, and they protest all the time,

231
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,840
and that is in fact the purpose of the location, is for people to have a public central place

232
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,560
where they may protest whatever and whenever they like.

233
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,520
Well, on June 1st, 2020, there was a peaceful protest in Lafayette Square.

234
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,420
And yes, it was actually peaceful.

235
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,380
Under the direction of Attorney General William Barr, hundreds of officers in riot gear cleared

236
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,440
the square so that Trump could walk through it, go to St. John's Church, and pose for

237
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
a photo-op.

238
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:06,120
Many, many journalists, from NBC, from CNN, from ABC, from the Australian show Sunrise,

239
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,400
as well as a lot of on-the-ground footage taken by protesters themselves, show that

240
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,580
the protest was indeed peaceful until the troops were sent in to clear the square.

241
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,420
As far as I can tell, and I might be wrong, Lafayette Square has never been cleared of

242
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,480
protesters in this manner.

243
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,720
Not during the civil rights movement, not during the protests against the Vietnam War,

244
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,320
9-11, George Bush, Tea Party, whatever.

245
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,680
But this time, it was cleared.

246
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,720
And it was cleared for Trump's photo-op.

247
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,280
It's a blatant violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of assembly, federal lawsuits

248
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,080
have been filed, and General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

249
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,800
has broken ranks with the administration and apologized for his part in this debacle.

250
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,160
This will go down in history as one of the defining negative moments of Trump's presidency.

251
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,600
And anybody who values their First Amendment rights should be outraged by his and the administration's

252
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,120
behavior in this matter.

253
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,720
Now, despite all of these things, I still think Trump's a better pick than Biden.

254
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,400
I still think Trump's a better pick than Bernie.

255
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,360
But not because I'm a die-hard Trump lover.

256
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,920
But because yes, even with all of these points against Trump, he's still better than the

257
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
alternatives.

258
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,240
He's still better than a neoliberal with Alzheimer's, and he's still better than

259
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,440
a socialist.

260
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,400
And in general, he's doing a much better job than either of them would.

261
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,360
But that is no reason to lose our heads, become partisans, and start inventing wild excuses

262
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,580
for the actual bad things he's done.

263
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,560
Nobody's perfect, Trump least of all.
