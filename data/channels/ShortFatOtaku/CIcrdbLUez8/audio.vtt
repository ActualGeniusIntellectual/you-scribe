00:00.000 --> 00:04.020
If you've watched my content, it should be no surprise to you that I don't actually

00:04.020 --> 00:06.640
consider myself to be a die-hard Trump fan.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.120
I have said consistently that I'm neutral on him.

00:09.120 --> 00:12.920
I think, if I were an American, I would probably vote for him.

00:12.920 --> 00:15.480
And I supported Bernie back in 2016.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.760
But really, I was hoping for Tulsi.

00:17.760 --> 00:23.580
However, the reason that people like me, the non-communist, non-socialist left, you know,

00:23.580 --> 00:27.480
the social liberal that wants democracy and capitalism intact, but doesn't mind the

00:27.480 --> 00:31.960
idea of a social safety net funded by taxation, that kind of person.

00:31.960 --> 00:37.360
People like me generally gravitate towards Trump because the left has ceded the sensible

00:37.360 --> 00:38.360
center left.

00:38.360 --> 00:42.660
It's either socialists or neoliberal, and people like me don't like either.

00:42.660 --> 00:46.380
And the right is no longer the religious right, now it's the populist right.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.240
And they are taking that center ground.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.780
They're taking up those issues that the left abandoned.

00:50.780 --> 00:52.880
That doesn't mean that I think Trump's perfect.

00:52.880 --> 00:53.880
Far from it.

00:53.960 --> 00:59.120
Because there does seem to be, for some reason, this preconception that I'm a Trump superfan.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.200
I'm not.

01:00.200 --> 01:03.040
And here are the things he's done that I really don't like.

01:03.040 --> 01:05.680
For example, I think Trump's recent debate performance was only so-so.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.160
I think it could have done a lot better.

01:07.160 --> 01:10.520
He bullied Biden, he got him flustered, which is what he had to do.

01:10.520 --> 01:14.640
But he didn't let Biden expand on his own mistakes a little bit more.

01:14.640 --> 01:17.640
And he certainly fell into that white supremacist trap.

01:17.640 --> 01:24.120
But are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say

01:24.120 --> 01:29.520
that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities,

01:29.520 --> 01:32.520
as we saw in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland?

01:32.520 --> 01:35.560
Are you prepared to specifically do it?

01:35.560 --> 01:40.120
I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.720
What are you saying?

01:41.720 --> 01:43.080
I'm willing to do anything.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.080
I want to see peace.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.080
Then do it, sir.

01:45.080 --> 01:46.080
Say it.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.080
Do it.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.080
What do you want to call him?

01:48.080 --> 01:49.080
What do you want to call him?

01:49.080 --> 01:50.080
Give me a name.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.080
Give me a name.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.080
What would you like me to condemn?

01:52.080 --> 01:53.080
Proud Boys.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.440
Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.440
But I'll tell you what.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.840
I'll tell you what.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.720
Somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left, because this is not a right

02:02.720 --> 02:03.720
wing problem.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.520
This is a left wing problem.

02:05.520 --> 02:07.520
This is a left wing problem.

02:07.520 --> 02:11.080
Antifa is an idea, not an organization.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.080
You gotta be kidding me.

02:12.080 --> 02:15.880
I know it's a product of his speaking style, because he's kind of bombastic and out there.

02:16.080 --> 02:21.120
But when asked to directly repudiate white supremacists, he should have just done it,

02:21.120 --> 02:23.320
because he's done it before, many times.

02:23.320 --> 02:30.960
We've got the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.560
Racism is evil.

02:32.560 --> 02:40.260
And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis,

02:40.260 --> 02:47.200
white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear

02:47.200 --> 02:49.540
as Americans.

02:49.540 --> 02:56.520
In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy.

02:56.520 --> 03:00.660
And yes, that means you shouldn't have to keep doing it, but this is a national debate.

03:00.660 --> 03:04.620
If there was one time you were going to repeat yourself again, this would be the time.

03:04.780 --> 03:11.500
I also think that sometimes Trump's chaotic nature makes dealing with America's enemies

03:11.500 --> 03:13.180
a bit too unpredictable.

03:13.180 --> 03:15.780
For example, this is from 2018, remember this?

03:15.780 --> 03:20.300
Donald Trump denies discussing assassination of Syria's Assad.

03:20.300 --> 03:25.000
US President Donald Trump has denied assertions by prominent journalist Bob Woodward in his

03:25.000 --> 03:30.220
new book that he ordered the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

03:30.220 --> 03:34.500
Mr. Trump said the idea was never even discussed with defense officials.

03:34.500 --> 03:39.240
Defense Secretary James Mattis also denied words attributed to him in Woodward's book.

03:39.240 --> 03:44.460
The book says Mr. Trump had ordered the Pentagon to arrange the assassination of the Syrian

03:44.460 --> 03:49.540
president after a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017 that was blamed on the Syrian

03:49.540 --> 03:50.540
government.

03:50.540 --> 03:54.140
Let's effin kill him, let's go in, let's kill the effin lot of him.

03:54.140 --> 03:56.540
Mr. Trump is reported to have told Mr. Mattis.

03:56.540 --> 03:59.700
Of course, at the time everyone said there was no way this is the case, this is just

03:59.700 --> 04:04.420
somebody writing yet another book where Trump says some wild off the cuff thing, there's

04:04.420 --> 04:07.180
been like a dozen of these that have come out over the past four years.

04:07.180 --> 04:11.340
And Trump himself said the same thing in an interview, question, is Bob Woodward a liar

04:11.340 --> 04:12.340
sir?

04:12.340 --> 04:14.340
Do you believe Bob Woodward is lying?

04:14.340 --> 04:17.080
President Trump, oh yeah sure, he's lying, sure.

04:17.080 --> 04:18.980
The book, you mean on the book?

04:18.980 --> 04:19.980
Yes sir.

04:19.980 --> 04:22.380
The book means nothing, it's a work of fiction.

04:22.380 --> 04:26.840
Already General Mattis has come out very very strongly, and I think you know General Mattis,

04:26.840 --> 04:31.500
he does what he wants to do, he's a very independent guy, he was insulted by the remarks that were

04:31.500 --> 04:35.780
attributed to him, and he came up with a very strong statement, I assume you read it,

04:35.780 --> 04:37.580
I hope you read it last night.

04:37.580 --> 04:42.900
Except a couple of weeks ago, Donald Trump completely flipped on that story, and said

04:42.900 --> 04:47.380
that he actually wanted to kill President Bashar al-Assad, and that it was General Mattis

04:47.380 --> 04:48.980
that prevented him from doing so.

04:48.980 --> 04:53.680
And is it true that after Assad gassed children for the second time, that it was you that

04:53.680 --> 04:57.780
wanted to take out Assad, that you had a good side on him, and that it was General Mattis

04:57.780 --> 05:01.220
who talked you out of it, and if it is true do you regret not taking him out, being that

05:01.260 --> 05:04.620
he's not, because he is a mass murderer?

05:04.620 --> 05:09.860
I would have rather taken him out, I had it all set, Mattis didn't want to do it.

05:09.860 --> 05:14.820
Mattis was a highly overrated general, and I let him go, he worked for Obama, he got

05:14.820 --> 05:21.340
fired by Obama also, and I thought that was maybe just a fluke, maybe they had different

05:21.340 --> 05:25.740
views, and he wanted the job very badly, I gave him the job, I didn't like him, I fired

05:25.740 --> 05:33.260
him, and to me he was a terrible general, he was a bad leader, and he wasn't doing the

05:33.260 --> 05:38.820
job with ISIS, he was not doing the job in Syria or Iraq with respect to ISIS, I got

05:38.820 --> 05:44.740
rid of ISIS after he was gone, I did a great job on ISIS, 100% of the caliphate.

05:44.740 --> 05:48.860
Transgender could be defined out of existence under Trump administration, that headline

05:48.860 --> 05:54.380
is a bit hyperbolic, but I personally still do not want to see any rollback of trans rights

05:54.380 --> 05:56.340
or gay marriage or anything like that.

05:56.340 --> 06:01.340
The Trump administration is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological immutable

06:01.340 --> 06:06.800
condition determined by genitalia at birth, the most drastic move yet in a government-wide

06:06.800 --> 06:11.540
effort to rollback recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil

06:11.540 --> 06:12.540
rights law.

06:12.540 --> 06:17.140
Now for even the most right-leaning of you, you have to understand, gender is not the

06:17.140 --> 06:22.120
same thing as biological sex, gender is not the biological immutable condition determined

06:22.120 --> 06:25.120
by genitalia at birth, that's sex.

06:25.120 --> 06:31.080
Gender is the social role, now I'm not going to be some kind of idiot and say that you

06:31.080 --> 06:35.560
can change your biological sex, no you can't, I'm also not going to say that there's no

06:35.560 --> 06:41.460
link between biological sex and gender role, there very clearly is, but they are not the

06:41.460 --> 06:46.400
same thing, and I do think that it's just another part of the freedom of the individual

06:46.400 --> 06:50.300
to choose to take on a different gender role than the one that normally goes with your

06:50.300 --> 06:51.600
biological sex.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.400
Nobody is obligated to treat you that way, but then again, nobody is obligated to treat

06:56.400 --> 07:01.040
you anyway, because being rude is not illegal, nor should it be.

07:01.040 --> 07:06.760
A series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened the legal concept of gender in federal

07:06.760 --> 07:12.440
programs including in education and healthcare, recognizing gender largely as an individual's

07:12.440 --> 07:15.600
choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.360
Well frankly, both of these are wrong, aren't they?

07:19.360 --> 07:23.880
Gender is not determined by the sex assigned at birth, gender is a related concept but

07:23.880 --> 07:29.040
it is its own thing, however gender is not the individual choice, because people don't

07:29.040 --> 07:35.000
choose to be trans, unless the intersectional logic has changed over the past 15 years,

07:35.000 --> 07:39.800
trans women may be women but not simply because they identify as them, and to be honest the

07:39.800 --> 07:44.640
Trump administration's rollback of this seems to be conflating sex and gender, and in the

07:44.640 --> 07:49.520
same vein we have transgender health protections reversed by the Trump administration, this

07:49.520 --> 07:51.000
happened a little over two months ago.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.040
I was actually on board with him removing trans people from the military, at least in

07:55.040 --> 07:58.720
active combat roles, because in situations where there may be fighting, there may be

07:58.720 --> 08:02.400
a lack of supply lines or something, there's no guarantee they're going to get their squishy

08:02.400 --> 08:06.760
skittles on time, and people who have to take medication are generally not allowed in those

08:06.760 --> 08:07.760
roles.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.160
But for me, this is too far.

08:09.160 --> 08:13.900
The Trump administration on Friday finalized a rule that would remove non-discrimination

08:13.900 --> 08:19.360
protections for LGBTQ people when it comes to healthcare and health insurance.

08:19.360 --> 08:24.200
The new rule defines sex discrimination as only applying when someone faces discrimination

08:24.200 --> 08:28.780
for being female or male and does not protect people from discrimination on the basis of

08:28.780 --> 08:31.560
sexual orientation or gender identity.

08:31.560 --> 08:35.320
Supporters of the new rule say that this is a necessary reversal of Obama era executive

08:35.320 --> 08:39.860
overreach and will reduce confusion about the legal meaning of sex discrimination.

08:39.860 --> 08:43.540
Critics argue that the rule could further harm an already vulnerable group, transgender

08:43.540 --> 08:47.720
people in the midst of a pandemic, and the historic uprest spurred by the killing of

08:47.720 --> 08:48.720
George Floyd.

08:48.720 --> 08:53.020
I can't help but wonder if the timing of this rule is by design so that this is something

08:53.020 --> 08:54.640
people won't pay attention to.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.220
And here's what the rule does.

08:56.220 --> 09:00.700
The rule focuses on non-discrimination protections laid out in section 1557 of the Affordable

09:00.700 --> 09:01.960
Care Act.

09:01.960 --> 09:06.460
That federal law established that it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, color,

09:06.460 --> 09:11.900
national origin, sex, age, or disability in certain health programs and activities.

09:11.900 --> 09:16.920
In 2016 an Obama era rule explained that the protections regarding sex encompassed those

09:16.920 --> 09:22.000
based on gender identity which it defined as male, female, neither, or a combination

09:22.000 --> 09:23.320
of male and female.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.840
And of course the Trump administration said, we're going back to the plain meaning of those

09:26.840 --> 09:29.160
terms which is based on biological sex.

09:29.160 --> 09:33.720
Now I get it because this is actually a problem with the wording of the Affordable Care Act.

09:33.720 --> 09:38.640
The Affordable Care Act protected based on race, color, national origin, sex, age, or

09:38.640 --> 09:39.640
disability.

09:39.640 --> 09:42.540
It did not protect for sexuality or gender identity.

09:42.540 --> 09:48.540
And Obama simply decided to define the word sex as including sexuality and gender identity

09:48.540 --> 09:50.100
which it clearly doesn't.

09:50.100 --> 09:54.360
But the solution here does leave those people open to potential discrimination.

09:54.360 --> 10:00.140
And frankly this rule reversal shouldn't have been done until section 1557 of the Affordable

10:00.140 --> 10:05.560
Care Act was changed to actually include gender identity and sexuality.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.560
Simple as that.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.220
And then of course we've got this clip.

10:08.500 --> 10:14.100
I remember this guy, Welche, he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas and he

10:14.100 --> 10:15.680
went down.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.380
He didn't, he was down.

10:18.380 --> 10:21.040
My knee, my knee.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.040
Nobody cared.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.040
These guys didn't care.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.040
They moved him aside.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.820
And they just walked right through.

10:25.820 --> 10:28.540
It was like, it was the most beautiful thing.

10:28.540 --> 10:32.460
No because after we take all that crap for weeks and weeks, they would take this crap

10:32.460 --> 10:35.700
and then you finally see men get up there and go right through.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.080
Wasn't it really a beautiful sight?

10:38.080 --> 10:42.280
Of course he's talking about Ali Welche, a reporter at MSNBC.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.920
You'll probably recognize this guy as the idiot who was on the scene saying that the

10:45.920 --> 10:50.720
protests were mostly peaceful as a fire raged around him.

10:50.720 --> 10:58.400
I want to be clear in how I characterize this, this is mostly a protest, it is not generally

10:58.400 --> 10:59.880
speaking unruly.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.640
Yes he is America's bagdaddy Bob.

11:02.640 --> 11:06.400
But frankly, whatever you think about the state of journalism right now, and it is pretty

11:06.400 --> 11:07.400
shit.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.680
Or about MSNBC, or about Ali Welche himself.

11:10.680 --> 11:14.840
The journalists that are covering the riots, especially the journalists that are covering

11:14.840 --> 11:18.760
the peaceful protests, should not be attacked by the cops.

11:18.760 --> 11:22.200
I get it, you have the fog of war, you don't know what's going on, you might not know who's

11:22.200 --> 11:25.120
who, people get caught up in the crossfire, these things happen.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.880
But man, it's not something to jeer about.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.280
Yes we get it, journalists are shit.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.240
We have to be better than them.

11:32.240 --> 11:36.360
Trump won't commit to a peaceful post-election transfer of power.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.960
In a response to a question the president complained about mail-in ballots and said

11:39.960 --> 11:44.080
there won't be a transfer frankly, there will be a continuation.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.920
In my opinion this is absolutely unconscionable.

11:46.920 --> 11:51.920
Every election that I can remember, up until 2016, the candidates said, regardless of who

11:51.920 --> 11:55.380
won, yes we will of course respect the outcome of the election.

11:55.380 --> 12:00.920
And in 2016 Hillary herself said it, until she lost, and then suddenly the left rioted

12:00.920 --> 12:02.360
for 4 years.

12:02.360 --> 12:05.240
But again, we have to be better than them.

12:05.240 --> 12:09.820
If Trump loses the election, fair and square, he has to go.

12:09.820 --> 12:16.800
In that situation, any attempt by him to hang on to the office would be monstrously authoritarian.

12:16.800 --> 12:21.060
Asking whether he would commit here today for a peaceful transfer of power after the

12:21.060 --> 12:26.240
November election, Mr. Trump demurred, passing on a chance to call for a calm and orderly

12:26.240 --> 12:27.240
election process.

12:27.240 --> 12:30.480
We're going to have to see what happens, he told a reporter.

12:30.480 --> 12:34.520
You know that I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.920
Get rid of the ballots and you'll be very peaceful, there won't be a transfer frankly,

12:37.920 --> 12:40.040
there will be a continuation.

12:40.040 --> 12:44.200
That was an apparent reference to mail-in ballots, which for months he has railed against.

12:44.200 --> 12:48.480
And no article not without evidence, there has definitely been some evidence of ballots

12:48.480 --> 12:50.320
disappearing and stuff like that.

12:50.320 --> 12:56.960
But still, what he has to say is, if I lose, if the evidence has been looked over, and

12:56.960 --> 13:00.320
I've lost fair and square, I will step down.

13:00.320 --> 13:03.260
His opponents already imagine him to be a tyrant.

13:03.260 --> 13:07.460
The winning move, as always, is to beat them on their level.

13:07.460 --> 13:10.600
To directly address and rebuke their claims.

13:10.600 --> 13:15.660
And just like with the debate question, his Trumpisms, I guess we'll call them, often

13:15.660 --> 13:17.320
do him more harm than good.

13:17.320 --> 13:22.680
And of course, probably most infamously, there was his clearing of Lafayette Square.

13:22.680 --> 13:27.480
From what I understand, Lafayette Square is kind of like Canada's Parliament Hill, or

13:27.480 --> 13:31.960
the UK's Speaker's Corner, where people show up and protest, and they protest all the time,

13:31.960 --> 13:36.840
and that is in fact the purpose of the location, is for people to have a public central place

13:36.840 --> 13:39.560
where they may protest whatever and whenever they like.

13:39.560 --> 13:44.520
Well, on June 1st, 2020, there was a peaceful protest in Lafayette Square.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.420
And yes, it was actually peaceful.

13:46.420 --> 13:51.380
Under the direction of Attorney General William Barr, hundreds of officers in riot gear cleared

13:51.380 --> 13:56.440
the square so that Trump could walk through it, go to St. John's Church, and pose for

13:56.440 --> 13:57.440
a photo-op.

13:57.440 --> 14:06.120
Many, many journalists, from NBC, from CNN, from ABC, from the Australian show Sunrise,

14:06.120 --> 14:10.400
as well as a lot of on-the-ground footage taken by protesters themselves, show that

14:10.400 --> 14:15.580
the protest was indeed peaceful until the troops were sent in to clear the square.

14:15.580 --> 14:20.420
As far as I can tell, and I might be wrong, Lafayette Square has never been cleared of

14:20.420 --> 14:22.480
protesters in this manner.

14:22.480 --> 14:26.720
Not during the civil rights movement, not during the protests against the Vietnam War,

14:26.720 --> 14:29.320
9-11, George Bush, Tea Party, whatever.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.680
But this time, it was cleared.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.720
And it was cleared for Trump's photo-op.

14:33.720 --> 14:38.280
It's a blatant violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of assembly, federal lawsuits

14:38.280 --> 14:43.080
have been filed, and General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

14:43.080 --> 14:47.800
has broken ranks with the administration and apologized for his part in this debacle.

14:47.800 --> 14:52.160
This will go down in history as one of the defining negative moments of Trump's presidency.

14:52.160 --> 14:57.600
And anybody who values their First Amendment rights should be outraged by his and the administration's

14:57.600 --> 14:59.120
behavior in this matter.

14:59.120 --> 15:03.720
Now, despite all of these things, I still think Trump's a better pick than Biden.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.400
I still think Trump's a better pick than Bernie.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.360
But not because I'm a die-hard Trump lover.

15:09.360 --> 15:13.920
But because yes, even with all of these points against Trump, he's still better than the

15:13.920 --> 15:14.920
alternatives.

15:14.920 --> 15:18.240
He's still better than a neoliberal with Alzheimer's, and he's still better than

15:18.240 --> 15:19.440
a socialist.

15:19.440 --> 15:23.400
And in general, he's doing a much better job than either of them would.

15:23.400 --> 15:29.360
But that is no reason to lose our heads, become partisans, and start inventing wild excuses

15:29.360 --> 15:31.580
for the actual bad things he's done.

15:31.580 --> 15:33.560
Nobody's perfect, Trump least of all.
