0	4020	If you've watched my content, it should be no surprise to you that I don't actually
4020	6640	consider myself to be a die-hard Trump fan.
6640	9120	I have said consistently that I'm neutral on him.
9120	12920	I think, if I were an American, I would probably vote for him.
12920	15480	And I supported Bernie back in 2016.
15480	17760	But really, I was hoping for Tulsi.
17760	23580	However, the reason that people like me, the non-communist, non-socialist left, you know,
23580	27480	the social liberal that wants democracy and capitalism intact, but doesn't mind the
27480	31960	idea of a social safety net funded by taxation, that kind of person.
31960	37360	People like me generally gravitate towards Trump because the left has ceded the sensible
37360	38360	center left.
38360	42660	It's either socialists or neoliberal, and people like me don't like either.
42660	46380	And the right is no longer the religious right, now it's the populist right.
46380	48240	And they are taking that center ground.
48240	50780	They're taking up those issues that the left abandoned.
50780	52880	That doesn't mean that I think Trump's perfect.
52880	53880	Far from it.
53960	59120	Because there does seem to be, for some reason, this preconception that I'm a Trump superfan.
59120	60200	I'm not.
60200	63040	And here are the things he's done that I really don't like.
63040	65680	For example, I think Trump's recent debate performance was only so-so.
65680	67160	I think it could have done a lot better.
67160	70520	He bullied Biden, he got him flustered, which is what he had to do.
70520	74640	But he didn't let Biden expand on his own mistakes a little bit more.
74640	77640	And he certainly fell into that white supremacist trap.
77640	84120	But are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say
84120	89520	that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities,
89520	92520	as we saw in Kenosha and as we've seen in Portland?
92520	95560	Are you prepared to specifically do it?
95560	100120	I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing.
100120	101720	What are you saying?
101720	103080	I'm willing to do anything.
103080	104080	I want to see peace.
104080	105080	Then do it, sir.
105080	106080	Say it.
106080	107080	Do it.
107080	108080	What do you want to call him?
108080	109080	What do you want to call him?
109080	110080	Give me a name.
110080	111080	Give me a name.
111080	112080	What would you like me to condemn?
112080	113080	Proud Boys.
113080	116440	Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.
116440	117440	But I'll tell you what.
117440	118840	I'll tell you what.
118840	122720	Somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left, because this is not a right
122720	123720	wing problem.
123720	125520	This is a left wing problem.
125520	127520	This is a left wing problem.
127520	131080	Antifa is an idea, not an organization.
131080	132080	You gotta be kidding me.
132080	135880	I know it's a product of his speaking style, because he's kind of bombastic and out there.
136080	141120	But when asked to directly repudiate white supremacists, he should have just done it,
141120	143320	because he's done it before, many times.
143320	150960	We've got the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists because they should be condemned totally.
150960	152560	Racism is evil.
152560	160260	And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis,
160260	167200	white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear
167200	169540	as Americans.
169540	176520	In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy.
176520	180660	And yes, that means you shouldn't have to keep doing it, but this is a national debate.
180660	184620	If there was one time you were going to repeat yourself again, this would be the time.
184780	191500	I also think that sometimes Trump's chaotic nature makes dealing with America's enemies
191500	193180	a bit too unpredictable.
193180	195780	For example, this is from 2018, remember this?
195780	200300	Donald Trump denies discussing assassination of Syria's Assad.
200300	205000	US President Donald Trump has denied assertions by prominent journalist Bob Woodward in his
205000	210220	new book that he ordered the assassination of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
210220	214500	Mr. Trump said the idea was never even discussed with defense officials.
214500	219240	Defense Secretary James Mattis also denied words attributed to him in Woodward's book.
219240	224460	The book says Mr. Trump had ordered the Pentagon to arrange the assassination of the Syrian
224460	229540	president after a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017 that was blamed on the Syrian
229540	230540	government.
230540	234140	Let's effin kill him, let's go in, let's kill the effin lot of him.
234140	236540	Mr. Trump is reported to have told Mr. Mattis.
236540	239700	Of course, at the time everyone said there was no way this is the case, this is just
239700	244420	somebody writing yet another book where Trump says some wild off the cuff thing, there's
244420	247180	been like a dozen of these that have come out over the past four years.
247180	251340	And Trump himself said the same thing in an interview, question, is Bob Woodward a liar
251340	252340	sir?
252340	254340	Do you believe Bob Woodward is lying?
254340	257080	President Trump, oh yeah sure, he's lying, sure.
257080	258980	The book, you mean on the book?
258980	259980	Yes sir.
259980	262380	The book means nothing, it's a work of fiction.
262380	266840	Already General Mattis has come out very very strongly, and I think you know General Mattis,
266840	271500	he does what he wants to do, he's a very independent guy, he was insulted by the remarks that were
271500	275780	attributed to him, and he came up with a very strong statement, I assume you read it,
275780	277580	I hope you read it last night.
277580	282900	Except a couple of weeks ago, Donald Trump completely flipped on that story, and said
282900	287380	that he actually wanted to kill President Bashar al-Assad, and that it was General Mattis
287380	288980	that prevented him from doing so.
288980	293680	And is it true that after Assad gassed children for the second time, that it was you that
293680	297780	wanted to take out Assad, that you had a good side on him, and that it was General Mattis
297780	301220	who talked you out of it, and if it is true do you regret not taking him out, being that
301260	304620	he's not, because he is a mass murderer?
304620	309860	I would have rather taken him out, I had it all set, Mattis didn't want to do it.
309860	314820	Mattis was a highly overrated general, and I let him go, he worked for Obama, he got
314820	321340	fired by Obama also, and I thought that was maybe just a fluke, maybe they had different
321340	325740	views, and he wanted the job very badly, I gave him the job, I didn't like him, I fired
325740	333260	him, and to me he was a terrible general, he was a bad leader, and he wasn't doing the
333260	338820	job with ISIS, he was not doing the job in Syria or Iraq with respect to ISIS, I got
338820	344740	rid of ISIS after he was gone, I did a great job on ISIS, 100% of the caliphate.
344740	348860	Transgender could be defined out of existence under Trump administration, that headline
348860	354380	is a bit hyperbolic, but I personally still do not want to see any rollback of trans rights
354380	356340	or gay marriage or anything like that.
356340	361340	The Trump administration is considering narrowly defining gender as a biological immutable
361340	366800	condition determined by genitalia at birth, the most drastic move yet in a government-wide
366800	371540	effort to rollback recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil
371540	372540	rights law.
372540	377140	Now for even the most right-leaning of you, you have to understand, gender is not the
377140	382120	same thing as biological sex, gender is not the biological immutable condition determined
382120	385120	by genitalia at birth, that's sex.
385120	391080	Gender is the social role, now I'm not going to be some kind of idiot and say that you
391080	395560	can change your biological sex, no you can't, I'm also not going to say that there's no
395560	401460	link between biological sex and gender role, there very clearly is, but they are not the
401460	406400	same thing, and I do think that it's just another part of the freedom of the individual
406400	410300	to choose to take on a different gender role than the one that normally goes with your
410300	411600	biological sex.
411600	416400	Nobody is obligated to treat you that way, but then again, nobody is obligated to treat
416400	421040	you anyway, because being rude is not illegal, nor should it be.
421040	426760	A series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened the legal concept of gender in federal
426760	432440	programs including in education and healthcare, recognizing gender largely as an individual's
432440	435600	choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth.
435600	439360	Well frankly, both of these are wrong, aren't they?
439360	443880	Gender is not determined by the sex assigned at birth, gender is a related concept but
443880	449040	it is its own thing, however gender is not the individual choice, because people don't
449040	455000	choose to be trans, unless the intersectional logic has changed over the past 15 years,
455000	459800	trans women may be women but not simply because they identify as them, and to be honest the
459800	464640	Trump administration's rollback of this seems to be conflating sex and gender, and in the
464640	469520	same vein we have transgender health protections reversed by the Trump administration, this
469520	471000	happened a little over two months ago.
471000	475040	I was actually on board with him removing trans people from the military, at least in
475040	478720	active combat roles, because in situations where there may be fighting, there may be
478720	482400	a lack of supply lines or something, there's no guarantee they're going to get their squishy
482400	486760	skittles on time, and people who have to take medication are generally not allowed in those
486760	487760	roles.
487760	489160	But for me, this is too far.
489160	493900	The Trump administration on Friday finalized a rule that would remove non-discrimination
493900	499360	protections for LGBTQ people when it comes to healthcare and health insurance.
499360	504200	The new rule defines sex discrimination as only applying when someone faces discrimination
504200	508780	for being female or male and does not protect people from discrimination on the basis of
508780	511560	sexual orientation or gender identity.
511560	515320	Supporters of the new rule say that this is a necessary reversal of Obama era executive
515320	519860	overreach and will reduce confusion about the legal meaning of sex discrimination.
519860	523540	Critics argue that the rule could further harm an already vulnerable group, transgender
523540	527720	people in the midst of a pandemic, and the historic uprest spurred by the killing of
527720	528720	George Floyd.
528720	533020	I can't help but wonder if the timing of this rule is by design so that this is something
533020	534640	people won't pay attention to.
534640	536220	And here's what the rule does.
536220	540700	The rule focuses on non-discrimination protections laid out in section 1557 of the Affordable
540700	541960	Care Act.
541960	546460	That federal law established that it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, color,
546460	551900	national origin, sex, age, or disability in certain health programs and activities.
551900	556920	In 2016 an Obama era rule explained that the protections regarding sex encompassed those
556920	562000	based on gender identity which it defined as male, female, neither, or a combination
562000	563320	of male and female.
563320	566840	And of course the Trump administration said, we're going back to the plain meaning of those
566840	569160	terms which is based on biological sex.
569160	573720	Now I get it because this is actually a problem with the wording of the Affordable Care Act.
573720	578640	The Affordable Care Act protected based on race, color, national origin, sex, age, or
578640	579640	disability.
579640	582540	It did not protect for sexuality or gender identity.
582540	588540	And Obama simply decided to define the word sex as including sexuality and gender identity
588540	590100	which it clearly doesn't.
590100	594360	But the solution here does leave those people open to potential discrimination.
594360	600140	And frankly this rule reversal shouldn't have been done until section 1557 of the Affordable
600140	605560	Care Act was changed to actually include gender identity and sexuality.
605560	606560	Simple as that.
606560	608220	And then of course we've got this clip.
608500	614100	I remember this guy, Welche, he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas and he
614100	615680	went down.
615680	618380	He didn't, he was down.
618380	621040	My knee, my knee.
621040	622040	Nobody cared.
622040	623040	These guys didn't care.
623040	624040	They moved him aside.
624040	625820	And they just walked right through.
625820	628540	It was like, it was the most beautiful thing.
628540	632460	No because after we take all that crap for weeks and weeks, they would take this crap
632460	635700	and then you finally see men get up there and go right through.
635700	638080	Wasn't it really a beautiful sight?
638080	642280	Of course he's talking about Ali Welche, a reporter at MSNBC.
642280	645920	You'll probably recognize this guy as the idiot who was on the scene saying that the
645920	650720	protests were mostly peaceful as a fire raged around him.
650720	658400	I want to be clear in how I characterize this, this is mostly a protest, it is not generally
658400	659880	speaking unruly.
659880	662640	Yes he is America's bagdaddy Bob.
662640	666400	But frankly, whatever you think about the state of journalism right now, and it is pretty
666400	667400	shit.
667400	670680	Or about MSNBC, or about Ali Welche himself.
670680	674840	The journalists that are covering the riots, especially the journalists that are covering
674840	678760	the peaceful protests, should not be attacked by the cops.
678760	682200	I get it, you have the fog of war, you don't know what's going on, you might not know who's
682200	685120	who, people get caught up in the crossfire, these things happen.
685120	687880	But man, it's not something to jeer about.
687880	690280	Yes we get it, journalists are shit.
690280	692240	We have to be better than them.
692240	696360	Trump won't commit to a peaceful post-election transfer of power.
696360	699960	In a response to a question the president complained about mail-in ballots and said
699960	704080	there won't be a transfer frankly, there will be a continuation.
704080	706920	In my opinion this is absolutely unconscionable.
706920	711920	Every election that I can remember, up until 2016, the candidates said, regardless of who
711920	715380	won, yes we will of course respect the outcome of the election.
715380	720920	And in 2016 Hillary herself said it, until she lost, and then suddenly the left rioted
720920	722360	for 4 years.
722360	725240	But again, we have to be better than them.
725240	729820	If Trump loses the election, fair and square, he has to go.
729820	736800	In that situation, any attempt by him to hang on to the office would be monstrously authoritarian.
736800	741060	Asking whether he would commit here today for a peaceful transfer of power after the
741060	746240	November election, Mr. Trump demurred, passing on a chance to call for a calm and orderly
746240	747240	election process.
747240	750480	We're going to have to see what happens, he told a reporter.
750480	754520	You know that I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster.
754520	757920	Get rid of the ballots and you'll be very peaceful, there won't be a transfer frankly,
757920	760040	there will be a continuation.
760040	764200	That was an apparent reference to mail-in ballots, which for months he has railed against.
764200	768480	And no article not without evidence, there has definitely been some evidence of ballots
768480	770320	disappearing and stuff like that.
770320	776960	But still, what he has to say is, if I lose, if the evidence has been looked over, and
776960	780320	I've lost fair and square, I will step down.
780320	783260	His opponents already imagine him to be a tyrant.
783260	787460	The winning move, as always, is to beat them on their level.
787460	790600	To directly address and rebuke their claims.
790600	795660	And just like with the debate question, his Trumpisms, I guess we'll call them, often
795660	797320	do him more harm than good.
797320	802680	And of course, probably most infamously, there was his clearing of Lafayette Square.
802680	807480	From what I understand, Lafayette Square is kind of like Canada's Parliament Hill, or
807480	811960	the UK's Speaker's Corner, where people show up and protest, and they protest all the time,
811960	816840	and that is in fact the purpose of the location, is for people to have a public central place
816840	819560	where they may protest whatever and whenever they like.
819560	824520	Well, on June 1st, 2020, there was a peaceful protest in Lafayette Square.
824520	826420	And yes, it was actually peaceful.
826420	831380	Under the direction of Attorney General William Barr, hundreds of officers in riot gear cleared
831380	836440	the square so that Trump could walk through it, go to St. John's Church, and pose for
836440	837440	a photo-op.
837440	846120	Many, many journalists, from NBC, from CNN, from ABC, from the Australian show Sunrise,
846120	850400	as well as a lot of on-the-ground footage taken by protesters themselves, show that
850400	855580	the protest was indeed peaceful until the troops were sent in to clear the square.
855580	860420	As far as I can tell, and I might be wrong, Lafayette Square has never been cleared of
860420	862480	protesters in this manner.
862480	866720	Not during the civil rights movement, not during the protests against the Vietnam War,
866720	869320	9-11, George Bush, Tea Party, whatever.
869320	871680	But this time, it was cleared.
871680	873720	And it was cleared for Trump's photo-op.
873720	878280	It's a blatant violation of the First Amendment right to freedom of assembly, federal lawsuits
878280	883080	have been filed, and General Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
883080	887800	has broken ranks with the administration and apologized for his part in this debacle.
887800	892160	This will go down in history as one of the defining negative moments of Trump's presidency.
892160	897600	And anybody who values their First Amendment rights should be outraged by his and the administration's
897600	899120	behavior in this matter.
899120	903720	Now, despite all of these things, I still think Trump's a better pick than Biden.
903720	906400	I still think Trump's a better pick than Bernie.
906400	909360	But not because I'm a die-hard Trump lover.
909360	913920	But because yes, even with all of these points against Trump, he's still better than the
913920	914920	alternatives.
914920	918240	He's still better than a neoliberal with Alzheimer's, and he's still better than
918240	919440	a socialist.
919440	923400	And in general, he's doing a much better job than either of them would.
923400	929360	But that is no reason to lose our heads, become partisans, and start inventing wild excuses
929360	931580	for the actual bad things he's done.
931580	933560	Nobody's perfect, Trump least of all.
