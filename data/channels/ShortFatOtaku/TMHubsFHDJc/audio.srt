1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,760
The last time I made a gaming-centric video, it was about Fourspoken, a game that we here

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,840
on the channel know pretty intimately. Fourspoken is a bad game. There's no two ways about

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,600
it. We gave it a 4 out of 10 because while the magic system and the open-world parkouring

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,440
showed a lot of promise, the rest of the game was just awful. They could have packaged a

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,480
completely different, better game around that core. And while the topic of today's

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,960
video, Hogwarts Legacy, is also a third-person, magic-based fantasyland adventure, I haven't

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,820
actually played it yet. Yeah, tons of people are online right now enjoying the game and

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,520
sharing their experiences, but that's because one of the perks of buying the deluxe edition

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,400
is that it comes out on February 7th, while standard edition plebs like me have to wait

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,640
until the 10th. That's okay, though. By all accounts, the game seems to be not amazing,

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,640
but not bad. Third-person, over-the-shoulder, shooting spells and deflecting in shields,

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,760
all the stuff you'd expect to see. The people who have played the game reported to have

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,800
a couple of oddities in how certain things function, but overall it's a very serviceable

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,120
game. It doesn't break the mold, but it also isn't in any way bad. If not for the

15
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,520
Hogwarts name, it would probably be considered very average. Unlike with Fourspoken, where

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,600
a huge chunk of the story surrounding that game came from just how fucking broken it

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,280
was, and the political aspect was clearly just a distraction from the game's terrible

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,720
quality, the story of Hogwarts Legacy has almost nothing to do with the game itself.

19
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,880
But it has to do with this woman, J.K. Rowling. Now, we all know who J.K. Rowling is. I made

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,040
a video about her years ago, in fact. Author of Harry Potter, andâ€¦ that's it. Her other

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,000
work isn't really that good. It just seems like she was in the right time, right place,

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,940
to come a phenomenon in the 90s and 2000s. And it's not hard to see how. Harry Potter

23
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,240
is a coming-of-age story. The boarding school environment always serves as a good fish-at-a-water

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,600
location, and the magic puts it over the top. It's a hero's journey. The villain is

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,160
a foil for the protagonist. It's a grand, epic quest to save the world. It hits all

26
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,580
the marks. There's nothing intrinsic to the setting of Hogwarts, or the wizarding

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,520
world itself, as fantastical as it is, that draws people in. It's the adventure that

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,680
really counts. The rest of it is window dressing. I think that's the main reason nobody cares

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,880
about the Fantastic Beasts movies. They're all window dressing.

30
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,920
However, relevant to this conversation is the fact that J.K. Rowling is a TERF, a trans-exclusionary

31
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,740
radical feminist. TERFs are a component of the left that believe that trans women are

32
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,120
not women, and do not have a place in female-only spaces. This puts them at odds with trans

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,000
activists and gender abolitionists, two other components of the left that fight for trans

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,560
equality and want to abolish the concept of men and women respectively. In my recent Christmas

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,920
video about Mary TERFmas, a phrase Rowling made go viral over the holidays, I went into

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,760
a bit more detail. The TLDR is that J.K. Rowling is most certainly a radical feminist. Her

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,320
political activism revolves around women's liberation and attacking the patriarchy, specifically

38
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,480
from a point of view that is strictly biologically female-centric, and for a long time she was

39
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,940
the left's darling. Within the past decade, however, her brand of leftism has declined

40
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,160
in favor of trans activism, specifically as intersectionalists have begun to see white

41
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,860
women not as the victimized oppressed, but as entitled oppressors themselves. So for

42
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,480
a while this put a lot of the rank-and-file lefties in a bind. We all remember those 2016

43
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,240
protests against Donald Trump's then-new presidency were like, right? Leftoids comparing

44
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,660
themselves to Dumbledore's Army and Trump to Voldemort, with the rest of us telling

45
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,520
them to read another fucking book? Old memes, good times.

46
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,520
When it comes to storytelling, leftists tend to claim rebellions against a corrupt tyrannical

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,800
order. Harry Potter and Star Wars immediately come to mind, because those stories map onto

48
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,160
revolutionary politics pretty well. They attempt to claim stories where they are the institutional

49
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,120
power like Star Trek or Mass Effect, but those ones don't quite fit, and you can often

50
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,280
find some leftoids decrying the lionization of those heroes because they're part of

51
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,960
the system. And of course, their attempts to colonize stories where they clearly don't

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,100
belong just seem petty and ridiculous. The point is, though, for the left-leaning terminally

53
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,940
online culture warrior, Harry Potter was one of their go-to references for years. But

54
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,380
now that the political winds have shifted, that's over.

55
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,780
I mentioned in my White Nervosa video that the attempt to make Harry Potter owned by

56
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,800
the fans instead of by JK Rowling because of her political views mirrors the attempt

57
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,340
to delegitimize Scott Cawthon's creation of Five Nights at Freddy's. Not that it

58
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,760
matters, though, because JK Rowling's still getting a big fat check every month. I remember

59
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,020
seeing the trailer for Hogwarts Legacy like a year ago and remarking on stream that the

60
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,960
trans activists were going to try to boycott the game. This is mainly because they were

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,500
actually successful at boycotting the Fantastic Beasts movies, or at least they think they

62
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,320
were. Personally, I think the main reason those movies failed is because they suck.

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,140
But to the trans activists, it probably appears like their boycott was a success, so now it

64
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,020
was time to go after Hogwarts Legacy. However, I never thought it would blow up this big,

65
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,980
though. I don't think we need to go over every single tweet on this topic. Lots of

66
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,660
other people have done that already. If you want to pause and read these moronic takes,

67
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,160
be my guest. But they're all saying the same basic thing, and I would rather analyze

68
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,540
it a little bit. Here's their logic. If you buy Hogwarts Legacy, you're killing trans

69
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,700
people. Why? Because JK Rowling gets even more money from the game's success, which

70
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,180
she will turn around and use to fund her TERF activism. And because TERF activism specifically

71
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,140
excludes trans women, when JK Rowling decides to do activism with her money, like, for example,

72
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,520
opening a female-only domestic violence shelter, that is a facility that won't help trans

73
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,880
women, meaning there's less resources available to trans women than there could be if the

74
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,040
shelter included them. Which means that trans women are now at a higher risk than they would

75
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,120
have been, meaning that they're more likely to be stuck in a domestic violence situation,

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,200
have to endure abuse, and be driven to drug use, prostitution, and suicide. The problem

77
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,280
with this example is that it presupposes that trans women have a right to JK Rowling's

78
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,700
activist money. And because JK Rowling refuses to give it to them, that's the same thing

79
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,600
as directly killing trans women. And if you give JK Rowling money, by buying this game,

80
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,360
you're killing them too. It's part of the wider logic that the existence of billionaires

81
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,840
kills the poor, because the billionaires could be using their wealth to help them,

82
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,240
and they don't. And so, if you support the billionaires through voluntary trade,

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,960
you are part of the problem. This is where the phrase, no ethical consumption under capitalism,

84
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,520
comes from. Because if you engage with the system, you uphold it, whether you want to or not.

85
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,760
Now, this idea is what lies beneath a lot of the pro-theft, pro-looting, pro-riding ethics on the

86
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,120
left. But it's hilarious to see people who sell a product say this phrase, since it implies you

87
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,800
should have just stolen it from them. There's many examples of this. But to stay on topic,

88
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,120
Emma Watson promoted a clothing line with the phrase, this is what a feminist looks like printed

89
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,120
on them. But it turns out, the shirts were being made with sweatshop labor, and the women who made

90
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,800
them earned a dollar an hour and slept 16 people to one bedroom. Karl Marx said at one point that

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,520
if given the chance, capitalism will commodify the revolution, and in doing so, reroute revolutionary

92
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,600
tendencies away from real change and towards purely symbolic efforts, like spending $25 on

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,640
a Che Guevara or a feminist shirt, and feeling like your practice for the day is complete,

94
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,400
while the systems of oppression remain in place. The problem with this point of view is that it

95
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,760
goes directly against another commonly stated leftist viewpoint, often encapsulated by this

96
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,600
comic, where the serf is suffering under the current system, and a smarmy internet asshole

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,400
tells him he's being hypocritical for participating in the system, when he has to in order to survive.

98
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,800
Cue the Vosch clip of him saying that socialists maximizing their wealth under capitalism is good.

99
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:08,520
On the one hand, there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. All of your engagement with the

100
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,560
system props it up, even if you are spreading an anti-capitalist message. And so, if you're going

101
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,440
to oppose the system, you must do so with violence, not with collaboration. This is the Sorelian

102
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,600
socialist view on violence. The Leninists also somewhat believe in this, though with a few

103
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,800
caveats. Lenin thought that exploiting capitalist consumption to directly further the revolution

104
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,360
was a good deal, famously saying, the last capitalist will sell us the rope that we hang

105
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,760
him with. On the other hand, there's the idea that socialists maximizing their wealth and power

106
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,000
within capitalism will give them a better position when the revolution comes. This is the Gramscian

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,680
view, where socialists have a moral obligation to infiltrate liberal institutions, and once firmly

108
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,240
entrenched, begin to use that institution's power to tilt the world more leftward. Movements like

109
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,720
feminism, racial activism, and the like, serve to destabilize liberal sensibilities, making these

110
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,880
institutions more vulnerable. Of course, no online leftward has ever read Georges Sorel,

111
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,480
or Vladimir Lenin, or Antonia Gramsci. They have no idea that these two views, that there's no

112
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,160
ethical consumption under capitalism, and that people should engage with liberal institutions

113
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,760
to subvert them, are mutually exclusive in practice. But they don't care, because at the

114
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,480
bottom of it is just hypocrisy. They want you to not buy Hogwarts Legacy because of a transphobia,

115
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,040
and you're part of the problem if you refuse. However, even as they hate Jeff Bezos and Amazon's

116
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,520
monopoly on everything, they still use Amazon Prime for that sweet two-day shipping. They

117
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,160
still watch Twitch because their favorite lefty still streams there, and they still enjoy the

118
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,240
boys on Prime Video for its subversive deconstruction of Americanism. They still shill

119
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,160
for games like Overwatch or Valorant, made by companies that support absolutely terrible

120
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,200
regimes overseas, involved in the suppression of racial, religious, and sexual minorities.

121
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,680
They're still addicted to Twitter, where their constant use supports one of the people they hate

122
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,240
the most, Elon Musk. They still use a phone built by child slave labor that the government uses to

123
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,840
track their every location, unless they've got a Fairphone like I do. All of these people

124
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,440
screeching about Harry Potter and no ethical consumption are literally unethically consuming

125
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,960
under capitalism themselves, with the excuse that they have to do it. But you guys need a new iPhone

126
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,080
or Amazon Prime just as much as the rest of us needs Hogwarts Legacy. The fact of the matter is,

127
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,600
you do it because you want to do it, because it's convenient, because it's cheap. That's

128
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,440
the material analysis. The reply of, you need a phone, you don't need Hogwarts Legacy, is stupid,

129
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,240
because that doesn't make the phone more ethically made. Again, unless it's a Fairphone. If there's

130
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,800
anything I've learned from environmental activists, it's that your needs do not make

131
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,360
your consumption ethical, and that leaving your needs unfulfilled is the only moral choice. But

132
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,580
even then, the environmental activists tend to excuse massive amounts of waste in the service

133
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,240
of their cause, while demanding that you turn off the gas. All of this is rooted in hypocrisy. They

134
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,760
don't want to stop exploitation, they just want to be the ones doing the exploiting. Of course,

135
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,120
I'm speaking about this entire topic within the Left's moral framework. Personally, I don't give

136
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,320
it. I don't think any of this is exploitative or immoral. I'm a capitalist. Play the game,

137
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,200
have fun. It's not your responsibility what other people do with your money after it's changed

138
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,520
hands, any more than it is their responsibility what you do with their product, after you own it.

139
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,960
And most of the normies agree with me, because the push to boycott Hogwarts Legacy absolutely

140
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,040
backfired. Calls for streamers to not cover the game, for players not to play it, for the whole

141
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,560
thing to just silently go away, it all fell on deaf ears. Hogwarts Legacy peaked at 1.3 million

142
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,800
viewers on Twitch, the highest view count for any single-player game on the service. Twitch,

143
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,120
the capitalist collaborationist that they are, partnered with Portkey Games to allow viewers

144
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,720
to get items in their own game for watching streamers play it, as long as they had their

145
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,560
accounts linked up. The Hogwarts branded controller immediately sold out upon release. Hogwarts

146
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,600
Legacy smashed sales records on PS5, Xbox, and Steam, with the Steam page being particularly

147
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,200
hilarious. Trans activists try to slap the game with tags such as transphobia and genocide

148
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,120
simulator, and gamers just leaned into it, turning the comments section into a shitposting

149
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,960
battleground. The truth is, people don't care about leftist moral sensibilities anymore. They

150
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,840
don't give a shit. They're tired of cancel culture, they're tired of being told what to do

151
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,120
and say and think by moral busybodies, they threw off the chains of the religious dogmatic right,

152
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,760
and now they're throwing off the chains of the woke oppressive left. Of course, the activist

153
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,760
wailed and gnashed their teeth in response. How dare the gamer chuds not fall into line! It's

154
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,560
always funny when this happens. I remember what it was like early in gamergate, where the game

155
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,840
journals and woke devs tried to spin consumer boycotts of their work as oppressive because it

156
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,280
denied them resources. Now they're crying that their own boycott failed, and that gamers are

157
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,480
apparently twisting themselves into pretzels to justify their behavior. It's always about

158
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,720
hypocrisy with these people. The funniest thing about their boycott is that it likely contributed

159
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,200
to the game's success. Hogwarts is being talked about like Elden Ring was when that game launched,

160
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,840
another title that progressives tried to boycott, that time with the smokescreen of accessibility,

161
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,320
and Elden Ring is a way better game. Once the Hogwarts Legacy boycott failed,

162
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,480
the trans activists turned their ire onto the streamers who dared ignore their commands.

163
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,840
The first blow was struck with the website HaveTheyStreamedThatWizardGame.com, a site

164
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,600
that you could plug any twitch stream into and it would tell you if they played Hogwarts Legacy.

165
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,000
This was built to be a simple boycott tool that the progs would use, but it was rapidly turned

166
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,560
into a tool for people to find streamers playing the game. One of my mod's shitposts went viral,

167
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,720
specifically because the trans activists initially took it to mean that she was one of them. The

168
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,400
site was actually pretty stupid, because all it measured is if you changed the game setting on

169
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,920
your stream to Hogwarts Legacy. You can change that setting without streaming the game, or you

170
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,400
can stream the game without the setting, and the site wouldn't know. In the end, the site shut

171
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,440
down after just a few days because everyone realized it was a fucking joke. After that

172
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,600
failure, the trans activists moved on to harassing streamers for playing it. There's multiple viral

173
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,360
clips of leftoids raiding streamers' chat rooms to shit on them for daring to play the game.

174
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:38,240
Go ahead, talk about it. I will ban you so fast, I don't give two fucks. This is my escape, this has always been my escape.

175
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
I love your face.

176
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,840
It will continue to be my escape. Fuck right on off if you have a problem with me playing this game.

177
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:50,200
I'm almost like thinking of just like either going offline or like, I'm barely into the second combat

178
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,080
here. And every time I look at chat, it's just, the conversation is just like, bothering me.

179
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,040
Maybe we can do like a pure, a be right back, like a, like a little break or something?

180
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,880
You can take a break if you want. I'll just stop talking and I'll just go fight and do the combat.

181
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,480
Y'all done did it now.

182
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,840
Harry Potter and anyone that plays it is a bigot. Oh, you're just a weird person. And a bully.

183
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:25,200
I'll tell you guys to end this right now. If you go around telling people who bought this game simply

184
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,160
for the enjoyment of playing the game, no other reason, you're an asshole. Plain and simple. You

185
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,920
are a fucking asshole. If you go around bothering people, you are a dick, you're an asshole. You are

186
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,600
the scum that people walk in the street and want to pass by as quickly as possible. Let's be clear,

187
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,440
streamers have a ban button and they should be using it. Crying over this sort of thing is kind

188
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,120
of cringe. But at the same time, this is absolutely demented behavior. None of these people are

189
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,560
actually viewers of the streamer in question. And even if they were, that doesn't give them control

190
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,680
over the stream. The activists are literally just bullies of the exact same caliber they claim to

191
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,920
oppose. When that tactic didn't work, the trans activists resorted to simply spoiling the game.

192
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,600
I'm not going to read off the spoilers, but I am going to display them on screen. So if you're only

193
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,680
listening to this in the background and don't want to be spoiled, you'll be all right. The

194
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,920
Prague's last ditch attempt to ruin everyone's fun was to simply post the endgame twist all over

195
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,240
social media. This doesn't stop streams. It doesn't make JK Rowling any poorer. This is just

196
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,200
being spiteful. This is the person screaming stop having fun. Okay, spoilers over. You can look back

197
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,640
now. Now I'm pretty sure that Portkey Games knew the shitshow was coming and added in a trans

198
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,480
character as token representation. It didn't work though, because the Wokes ignored it and the

199
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
Normies just saw her as being shoehorned in. Funnily enough, following in the JK Rowling

200
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,600
tradition of having weird racialized names for all of her characters, the trans woman is named

201
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,760
Sarona Ryan, which a lot of trans activists took as a slap in the face. Get it, sir? Sarona?

202
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,920
There's a deeper problem though with the call for trans representation. How do you know if a

203
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,120
character's trans? If they're the ideal trans woman, then they're passing, they're stealthing,

204
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,480
and you shouldn't know that they're trans, unless there's a sex scene with them. If they're not

205
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,200
passing, if they look manly or they have a non-feminine voice, then they're viewed as an

206
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,260
ugly caricature of a trans woman. The only way to make non-sexual, non-grotesque trans representation

207
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,080
is to shoehorn in the fact that she's trans into dialogue, to have a cringy pronoun scene or some

208
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,680
shit. There was also a smaller side controversy about anti-semitism, where the progs believe that

209
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,020
the goblins are meant to be Jewish because they're greedy, short, hook-nosed little creatures who

210
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,160
love money. Listen, I don't see a Jewish person when I look at this picture, and if you do,

211
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,800
you're probably the fucking racist here, not me. But to be honest, there's not much of a story

212
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,540
here. However, it was funny seeing Vivian Wolf twisting herself into pretzels, explaining how

213
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,640
goblins were Judeo-Bolsheviks, therefore making JK Rowling a Nazi, because the goblins don't

214
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,000
believe in the concept of trade. That is a rabbit hole I'll have to cover another time, though.

215
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,760
All of this stuff was used as justification for the boycott, but apparently none of it applied if

216
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,840
you had the correct politics. Again, hypocrisy. As left-leaning game journos, bloggers, and content

217
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,720
creators all had a field day talking about Hogwarts Legacy, earning clicks and money virtue signaling

218
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,440
about how bad it is, how terrible you are if you play it. They are as much a part of the machine

219
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,600
as everyone else is. As I am. The difference is, they're leftist, therefore they're allowed.

220
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,240
Apparently you can engage in exploitative systems if your politics are correct. It is all hypocrisy.

221
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,360
At the end of the day, Hogwarts Legacy appears to be a pretty good game. It's not a 10 out of 10 or

222
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,720
anything, but certainly something you can pick up to get yourself through the dry spell of new

223
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,280
releases that always plagues the first few months of the year. Most of the people talking about the

224
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,280
game right now are doing so because of the controversy, the failed boycott, the activist

225
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,280
screeching. The game itself doesn't actually warrant this much attention. And because I

226
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,280
personally think that progressive morals and sensibilities are retarded, I'm going to be

227
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,800
streaming Hogwarts Legacy right after this video comes out. So make sure you tune in,

228
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,240
guys. Let's shit on the leftoids together. I'll see you there. I love you.
