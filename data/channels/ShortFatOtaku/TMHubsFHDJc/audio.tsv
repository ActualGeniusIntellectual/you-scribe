0	16760	The last time I made a gaming-centric video, it was about Fourspoken, a game that we here
16760	20840	on the channel know pretty intimately. Fourspoken is a bad game. There's no two ways about
20840	24600	it. We gave it a 4 out of 10 because while the magic system and the open-world parkouring
24600	28440	showed a lot of promise, the rest of the game was just awful. They could have packaged a
28440	32480	completely different, better game around that core. And while the topic of today's
32480	37960	video, Hogwarts Legacy, is also a third-person, magic-based fantasyland adventure, I haven't
37960	41820	actually played it yet. Yeah, tons of people are online right now enjoying the game and
41820	45520	sharing their experiences, but that's because one of the perks of buying the deluxe edition
45520	49400	is that it comes out on February 7th, while standard edition plebs like me have to wait
49400	53640	until the 10th. That's okay, though. By all accounts, the game seems to be not amazing,
53640	57640	but not bad. Third-person, over-the-shoulder, shooting spells and deflecting in shields,
57640	60760	all the stuff you'd expect to see. The people who have played the game reported to have
60760	64800	a couple of oddities in how certain things function, but overall it's a very serviceable
64800	68120	game. It doesn't break the mold, but it also isn't in any way bad. If not for the
68120	72520	Hogwarts name, it would probably be considered very average. Unlike with Fourspoken, where
72520	76600	a huge chunk of the story surrounding that game came from just how fucking broken it
76600	80280	was, and the political aspect was clearly just a distraction from the game's terrible
80280	84720	quality, the story of Hogwarts Legacy has almost nothing to do with the game itself.
84720	88880	But it has to do with this woman, J.K. Rowling. Now, we all know who J.K. Rowling is. I made
88880	93040	a video about her years ago, in fact. Author of Harry Potter, andâ€¦ that's it. Her other
93040	97000	work isn't really that good. It just seems like she was in the right time, right place,
97000	100940	to come a phenomenon in the 90s and 2000s. And it's not hard to see how. Harry Potter
100940	105240	is a coming-of-age story. The boarding school environment always serves as a good fish-at-a-water
105240	108600	location, and the magic puts it over the top. It's a hero's journey. The villain is
108600	112160	a foil for the protagonist. It's a grand, epic quest to save the world. It hits all
112160	115580	the marks. There's nothing intrinsic to the setting of Hogwarts, or the wizarding
115580	119520	world itself, as fantastical as it is, that draws people in. It's the adventure that
119520	123680	really counts. The rest of it is window dressing. I think that's the main reason nobody cares
123680	126880	about the Fantastic Beasts movies. They're all window dressing.
126880	131920	However, relevant to this conversation is the fact that J.K. Rowling is a TERF, a trans-exclusionary
131920	135740	radical feminist. TERFs are a component of the left that believe that trans women are
135740	140120	not women, and do not have a place in female-only spaces. This puts them at odds with trans
140120	144000	activists and gender abolitionists, two other components of the left that fight for trans
144000	148560	equality and want to abolish the concept of men and women respectively. In my recent Christmas
148560	152920	video about Mary TERFmas, a phrase Rowling made go viral over the holidays, I went into
152920	157760	a bit more detail. The TLDR is that J.K. Rowling is most certainly a radical feminist. Her
157760	162320	political activism revolves around women's liberation and attacking the patriarchy, specifically
162320	167480	from a point of view that is strictly biologically female-centric, and for a long time she was
167480	171940	the left's darling. Within the past decade, however, her brand of leftism has declined
171940	176160	in favor of trans activism, specifically as intersectionalists have begun to see white
176160	180860	women not as the victimized oppressed, but as entitled oppressors themselves. So for
180860	185480	a while this put a lot of the rank-and-file lefties in a bind. We all remember those 2016
185480	189240	protests against Donald Trump's then-new presidency were like, right? Leftoids comparing
189240	192660	themselves to Dumbledore's Army and Trump to Voldemort, with the rest of us telling
192660	195520	them to read another fucking book? Old memes, good times.
195560	199520	When it comes to storytelling, leftists tend to claim rebellions against a corrupt tyrannical
199520	203800	order. Harry Potter and Star Wars immediately come to mind, because those stories map onto
203800	208160	revolutionary politics pretty well. They attempt to claim stories where they are the institutional
208160	212120	power like Star Trek or Mass Effect, but those ones don't quite fit, and you can often
212120	216280	find some leftoids decrying the lionization of those heroes because they're part of
216280	219960	the system. And of course, their attempts to colonize stories where they clearly don't
219960	224100	belong just seem petty and ridiculous. The point is, though, for the left-leaning terminally
224100	228940	online culture warrior, Harry Potter was one of their go-to references for years. But
228940	231380	now that the political winds have shifted, that's over.
231380	234780	I mentioned in my White Nervosa video that the attempt to make Harry Potter owned by
234780	238800	the fans instead of by JK Rowling because of her political views mirrors the attempt
238800	242340	to delegitimize Scott Cawthon's creation of Five Nights at Freddy's. Not that it
242340	245760	matters, though, because JK Rowling's still getting a big fat check every month. I remember
245760	250020	seeing the trailer for Hogwarts Legacy like a year ago and remarking on stream that the
250020	253960	trans activists were going to try to boycott the game. This is mainly because they were
253960	258500	actually successful at boycotting the Fantastic Beasts movies, or at least they think they
258500	262320	were. Personally, I think the main reason those movies failed is because they suck.
262320	266140	But to the trans activists, it probably appears like their boycott was a success, so now it
266140	270020	was time to go after Hogwarts Legacy. However, I never thought it would blow up this big,
270020	273980	though. I don't think we need to go over every single tweet on this topic. Lots of
273980	277660	other people have done that already. If you want to pause and read these moronic takes,
277660	281160	be my guest. But they're all saying the same basic thing, and I would rather analyze
281160	285540	it a little bit. Here's their logic. If you buy Hogwarts Legacy, you're killing trans
285540	289700	people. Why? Because JK Rowling gets even more money from the game's success, which
289700	294180	she will turn around and use to fund her TERF activism. And because TERF activism specifically
294180	299140	excludes trans women, when JK Rowling decides to do activism with her money, like, for example,
299140	303520	opening a female-only domestic violence shelter, that is a facility that won't help trans
303520	306880	women, meaning there's less resources available to trans women than there could be if the
306880	310040	shelter included them. Which means that trans women are now at a higher risk than they would
310040	313120	have been, meaning that they're more likely to be stuck in a domestic violence situation,
313120	317200	have to endure abuse, and be driven to drug use, prostitution, and suicide. The problem
317200	321280	with this example is that it presupposes that trans women have a right to JK Rowling's
321280	324700	activist money. And because JK Rowling refuses to give it to them, that's the same thing
324700	329600	as directly killing trans women. And if you give JK Rowling money, by buying this game,
329600	333360	you're killing them too. It's part of the wider logic that the existence of billionaires
333360	336840	kills the poor, because the billionaires could be using their wealth to help them,
336840	340240	and they don't. And so, if you support the billionaires through voluntary trade,
340240	344960	you are part of the problem. This is where the phrase, no ethical consumption under capitalism,
344960	348520	comes from. Because if you engage with the system, you uphold it, whether you want to or not.
348520	354760	Now, this idea is what lies beneath a lot of the pro-theft, pro-looting, pro-riding ethics on the
354760	359120	left. But it's hilarious to see people who sell a product say this phrase, since it implies you
359120	362800	should have just stolen it from them. There's many examples of this. But to stay on topic,
362880	367120	Emma Watson promoted a clothing line with the phrase, this is what a feminist looks like printed
367120	371120	on them. But it turns out, the shirts were being made with sweatshop labor, and the women who made
371120	375800	them earned a dollar an hour and slept 16 people to one bedroom. Karl Marx said at one point that
375800	380520	if given the chance, capitalism will commodify the revolution, and in doing so, reroute revolutionary
380520	385600	tendencies away from real change and towards purely symbolic efforts, like spending $25 on
385600	389640	a Che Guevara or a feminist shirt, and feeling like your practice for the day is complete,
389640	393400	while the systems of oppression remain in place. The problem with this point of view is that it
393400	397760	goes directly against another commonly stated leftist viewpoint, often encapsulated by this
397760	401600	comic, where the serf is suffering under the current system, and a smarmy internet asshole
401600	405400	tells him he's being hypocritical for participating in the system, when he has to in order to survive.
405400	409800	Cue the Vosch clip of him saying that socialists maximizing their wealth under capitalism is good.
419640	428520	On the one hand, there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. All of your engagement with the
428520	432560	system props it up, even if you are spreading an anti-capitalist message. And so, if you're going
432560	437440	to oppose the system, you must do so with violence, not with collaboration. This is the Sorelian
437440	441600	socialist view on violence. The Leninists also somewhat believe in this, though with a few
441600	445800	caveats. Lenin thought that exploiting capitalist consumption to directly further the revolution
445800	449360	was a good deal, famously saying, the last capitalist will sell us the rope that we hang
449360	453760	him with. On the other hand, there's the idea that socialists maximizing their wealth and power
453760	459000	within capitalism will give them a better position when the revolution comes. This is the Gramscian
459000	463680	view, where socialists have a moral obligation to infiltrate liberal institutions, and once firmly
463680	468240	entrenched, begin to use that institution's power to tilt the world more leftward. Movements like
468240	472720	feminism, racial activism, and the like, serve to destabilize liberal sensibilities, making these
472720	476880	institutions more vulnerable. Of course, no online leftward has ever read Georges Sorel,
476880	481480	or Vladimir Lenin, or Antonia Gramsci. They have no idea that these two views, that there's no
481480	485160	ethical consumption under capitalism, and that people should engage with liberal institutions
485160	488760	to subvert them, are mutually exclusive in practice. But they don't care, because at the
488760	493480	bottom of it is just hypocrisy. They want you to not buy Hogwarts Legacy because of a transphobia,
493480	498040	and you're part of the problem if you refuse. However, even as they hate Jeff Bezos and Amazon's
498040	502520	monopoly on everything, they still use Amazon Prime for that sweet two-day shipping. They
502520	506160	still watch Twitch because their favorite lefty still streams there, and they still enjoy the
506160	510240	boys on Prime Video for its subversive deconstruction of Americanism. They still shill
510240	514160	for games like Overwatch or Valorant, made by companies that support absolutely terrible
514160	518200	regimes overseas, involved in the suppression of racial, religious, and sexual minorities.
518200	521680	They're still addicted to Twitter, where their constant use supports one of the people they hate
521680	526240	the most, Elon Musk. They still use a phone built by child slave labor that the government uses to
526240	529840	track their every location, unless they've got a Fairphone like I do. All of these people
529840	534440	screeching about Harry Potter and no ethical consumption are literally unethically consuming
534440	538960	under capitalism themselves, with the excuse that they have to do it. But you guys need a new iPhone
538960	543080	or Amazon Prime just as much as the rest of us needs Hogwarts Legacy. The fact of the matter is,
543080	546600	you do it because you want to do it, because it's convenient, because it's cheap. That's
546600	551440	the material analysis. The reply of, you need a phone, you don't need Hogwarts Legacy, is stupid,
551440	555240	because that doesn't make the phone more ethically made. Again, unless it's a Fairphone. If there's
555280	558800	anything I've learned from environmental activists, it's that your needs do not make
558800	563360	your consumption ethical, and that leaving your needs unfulfilled is the only moral choice. But
563360	567580	even then, the environmental activists tend to excuse massive amounts of waste in the service
567580	572240	of their cause, while demanding that you turn off the gas. All of this is rooted in hypocrisy. They
572240	576760	don't want to stop exploitation, they just want to be the ones doing the exploiting. Of course,
576760	581120	I'm speaking about this entire topic within the Left's moral framework. Personally, I don't give
581280	585320	it. I don't think any of this is exploitative or immoral. I'm a capitalist. Play the game,
585320	589200	have fun. It's not your responsibility what other people do with your money after it's changed
589200	593520	hands, any more than it is their responsibility what you do with their product, after you own it.
593520	597960	And most of the normies agree with me, because the push to boycott Hogwarts Legacy absolutely
597960	602040	backfired. Calls for streamers to not cover the game, for players not to play it, for the whole
602040	607560	thing to just silently go away, it all fell on deaf ears. Hogwarts Legacy peaked at 1.3 million
607800	612800	viewers on Twitch, the highest view count for any single-player game on the service. Twitch,
612800	617120	the capitalist collaborationist that they are, partnered with Portkey Games to allow viewers
617120	620720	to get items in their own game for watching streamers play it, as long as they had their
620720	625560	accounts linked up. The Hogwarts branded controller immediately sold out upon release. Hogwarts
625560	630600	Legacy smashed sales records on PS5, Xbox, and Steam, with the Steam page being particularly
630600	635200	hilarious. Trans activists try to slap the game with tags such as transphobia and genocide
635240	639120	simulator, and gamers just leaned into it, turning the comments section into a shitposting
639120	642960	battleground. The truth is, people don't care about leftist moral sensibilities anymore. They
642960	645840	don't give a shit. They're tired of cancel culture, they're tired of being told what to do
645840	650120	and say and think by moral busybodies, they threw off the chains of the religious dogmatic right,
650120	653760	and now they're throwing off the chains of the woke oppressive left. Of course, the activist
653760	658760	wailed and gnashed their teeth in response. How dare the gamer chuds not fall into line! It's
658760	662560	always funny when this happens. I remember what it was like early in gamergate, where the game
662600	666840	journals and woke devs tried to spin consumer boycotts of their work as oppressive because it
666840	671280	denied them resources. Now they're crying that their own boycott failed, and that gamers are
671280	675480	apparently twisting themselves into pretzels to justify their behavior. It's always about
675480	679720	hypocrisy with these people. The funniest thing about their boycott is that it likely contributed
679720	684200	to the game's success. Hogwarts is being talked about like Elden Ring was when that game launched,
684200	687840	another title that progressives tried to boycott, that time with the smokescreen of accessibility,
687840	691320	and Elden Ring is a way better game. Once the Hogwarts Legacy boycott failed,
691440	695480	the trans activists turned their ire onto the streamers who dared ignore their commands.
695480	699840	The first blow was struck with the website HaveTheyStreamedThatWizardGame.com, a site
699840	703600	that you could plug any twitch stream into and it would tell you if they played Hogwarts Legacy.
703600	708000	This was built to be a simple boycott tool that the progs would use, but it was rapidly turned
708000	712560	into a tool for people to find streamers playing the game. One of my mod's shitposts went viral,
712560	716720	specifically because the trans activists initially took it to mean that she was one of them. The
716720	720400	site was actually pretty stupid, because all it measured is if you changed the game setting on
720400	723920	your stream to Hogwarts Legacy. You can change that setting without streaming the game, or you
723920	727400	can stream the game without the setting, and the site wouldn't know. In the end, the site shut
727400	731440	down after just a few days because everyone realized it was a fucking joke. After that
731440	735600	failure, the trans activists moved on to harassing streamers for playing it. There's multiple viral
735600	739360	clips of leftoids raiding streamers' chat rooms to shit on them for daring to play the game.
751400	758240	Go ahead, talk about it. I will ban you so fast, I don't give two fucks. This is my escape, this has always been my escape.
758240	759240	I love your face.
759240	764840	It will continue to be my escape. Fuck right on off if you have a problem with me playing this game.
764840	770200	I'm almost like thinking of just like either going offline or like, I'm barely into the second combat
770200	775080	here. And every time I look at chat, it's just, the conversation is just like, bothering me.
775080	780040	Maybe we can do like a pure, a be right back, like a, like a little break or something?
780080	783880	You can take a break if you want. I'll just stop talking and I'll just go fight and do the combat.
789160	790480	Y'all done did it now.
791360	797840	Harry Potter and anyone that plays it is a bigot. Oh, you're just a weird person. And a bully.
798360	805200	I'll tell you guys to end this right now. If you go around telling people who bought this game simply
805240	810160	for the enjoyment of playing the game, no other reason, you're an asshole. Plain and simple. You
810160	816920	are a fucking asshole. If you go around bothering people, you are a dick, you're an asshole. You are
816920	821600	the scum that people walk in the street and want to pass by as quickly as possible. Let's be clear,
821600	825440	streamers have a ban button and they should be using it. Crying over this sort of thing is kind
825440	830120	of cringe. But at the same time, this is absolutely demented behavior. None of these people are
830120	833560	actually viewers of the streamer in question. And even if they were, that doesn't give them control
833560	838680	over the stream. The activists are literally just bullies of the exact same caliber they claim to
838680	842920	oppose. When that tactic didn't work, the trans activists resorted to simply spoiling the game.
842920	846600	I'm not going to read off the spoilers, but I am going to display them on screen. So if you're only
846600	849680	listening to this in the background and don't want to be spoiled, you'll be all right. The
849680	854920	Prague's last ditch attempt to ruin everyone's fun was to simply post the endgame twist all over
854920	859240	social media. This doesn't stop streams. It doesn't make JK Rowling any poorer. This is just
859320	864200	being spiteful. This is the person screaming stop having fun. Okay, spoilers over. You can look back
864200	868640	now. Now I'm pretty sure that Portkey Games knew the shitshow was coming and added in a trans
868640	872480	character as token representation. It didn't work though, because the Wokes ignored it and the
872480	876480	Normies just saw her as being shoehorned in. Funnily enough, following in the JK Rowling
876480	880600	tradition of having weird racialized names for all of her characters, the trans woman is named
880600	885760	Sarona Ryan, which a lot of trans activists took as a slap in the face. Get it, sir? Sarona?
885840	889920	There's a deeper problem though with the call for trans representation. How do you know if a
889920	894120	character's trans? If they're the ideal trans woman, then they're passing, they're stealthing,
894120	897480	and you shouldn't know that they're trans, unless there's a sex scene with them. If they're not
897480	901200	passing, if they look manly or they have a non-feminine voice, then they're viewed as an
901200	907260	ugly caricature of a trans woman. The only way to make non-sexual, non-grotesque trans representation
907260	912080	is to shoehorn in the fact that she's trans into dialogue, to have a cringy pronoun scene or some
912080	916680	shit. There was also a smaller side controversy about anti-semitism, where the progs believe that
916680	921020	the goblins are meant to be Jewish because they're greedy, short, hook-nosed little creatures who
921020	925160	love money. Listen, I don't see a Jewish person when I look at this picture, and if you do,
925160	928800	you're probably the fucking racist here, not me. But to be honest, there's not much of a story
928800	933540	here. However, it was funny seeing Vivian Wolf twisting herself into pretzels, explaining how
933540	938640	goblins were Judeo-Bolsheviks, therefore making JK Rowling a Nazi, because the goblins don't
938640	942000	believe in the concept of trade. That is a rabbit hole I'll have to cover another time, though.
942000	946760	All of this stuff was used as justification for the boycott, but apparently none of it applied if
946760	951840	you had the correct politics. Again, hypocrisy. As left-leaning game journos, bloggers, and content
951840	956720	creators all had a field day talking about Hogwarts Legacy, earning clicks and money virtue signaling
956720	960440	about how bad it is, how terrible you are if you play it. They are as much a part of the machine
960440	964600	as everyone else is. As I am. The difference is, they're leftist, therefore they're allowed.
964600	970240	Apparently you can engage in exploitative systems if your politics are correct. It is all hypocrisy.
970240	974360	At the end of the day, Hogwarts Legacy appears to be a pretty good game. It's not a 10 out of 10 or
974360	977720	anything, but certainly something you can pick up to get yourself through the dry spell of new
977720	981280	releases that always plagues the first few months of the year. Most of the people talking about the
981280	985280	game right now are doing so because of the controversy, the failed boycott, the activist
985280	989280	screeching. The game itself doesn't actually warrant this much attention. And because I
989280	993280	personally think that progressive morals and sensibilities are retarded, I'm going to be
993320	996800	streaming Hogwarts Legacy right after this video comes out. So make sure you tune in,
996800	1000240	guys. Let's shit on the leftoids together. I'll see you there. I love you.
