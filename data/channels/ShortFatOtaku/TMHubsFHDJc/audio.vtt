WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.760
The last time I made a gaming-centric video, it was about Fourspoken, a game that we here

00:16.760 --> 00:20.840
on the channel know pretty intimately. Fourspoken is a bad game. There's no two ways about

00:20.840 --> 00:24.600
it. We gave it a 4 out of 10 because while the magic system and the open-world parkouring

00:24.600 --> 00:28.440
showed a lot of promise, the rest of the game was just awful. They could have packaged a

00:28.440 --> 00:32.480
completely different, better game around that core. And while the topic of today's

00:32.480 --> 00:37.960
video, Hogwarts Legacy, is also a third-person, magic-based fantasyland adventure, I haven't

00:37.960 --> 00:41.820
actually played it yet. Yeah, tons of people are online right now enjoying the game and

00:41.820 --> 00:45.520
sharing their experiences, but that's because one of the perks of buying the deluxe edition

00:45.520 --> 00:49.400
is that it comes out on February 7th, while standard edition plebs like me have to wait

00:49.400 --> 00:53.640
until the 10th. That's okay, though. By all accounts, the game seems to be not amazing,

00:53.640 --> 00:57.640
but not bad. Third-person, over-the-shoulder, shooting spells and deflecting in shields,

00:57.640 --> 01:00.760
all the stuff you'd expect to see. The people who have played the game reported to have

01:00.760 --> 01:04.800
a couple of oddities in how certain things function, but overall it's a very serviceable

01:04.800 --> 01:08.120
game. It doesn't break the mold, but it also isn't in any way bad. If not for the

01:08.120 --> 01:12.520
Hogwarts name, it would probably be considered very average. Unlike with Fourspoken, where

01:12.520 --> 01:16.600
a huge chunk of the story surrounding that game came from just how fucking broken it

01:16.600 --> 01:20.280
was, and the political aspect was clearly just a distraction from the game's terrible

01:20.280 --> 01:24.720
quality, the story of Hogwarts Legacy has almost nothing to do with the game itself.

01:24.720 --> 01:28.880
But it has to do with this woman, J.K. Rowling. Now, we all know who J.K. Rowling is. I made

01:28.880 --> 01:33.040
a video about her years ago, in fact. Author of Harry Potter, andâ€¦ that's it. Her other

01:33.040 --> 01:37.000
work isn't really that good. It just seems like she was in the right time, right place,

01:37.000 --> 01:40.940
to come a phenomenon in the 90s and 2000s. And it's not hard to see how. Harry Potter

01:40.940 --> 01:45.240
is a coming-of-age story. The boarding school environment always serves as a good fish-at-a-water

01:45.240 --> 01:48.600
location, and the magic puts it over the top. It's a hero's journey. The villain is

01:48.600 --> 01:52.160
a foil for the protagonist. It's a grand, epic quest to save the world. It hits all

01:52.160 --> 01:55.580
the marks. There's nothing intrinsic to the setting of Hogwarts, or the wizarding

01:55.580 --> 01:59.520
world itself, as fantastical as it is, that draws people in. It's the adventure that

01:59.520 --> 02:03.680
really counts. The rest of it is window dressing. I think that's the main reason nobody cares

02:03.680 --> 02:06.880
about the Fantastic Beasts movies. They're all window dressing.

02:06.880 --> 02:11.920
However, relevant to this conversation is the fact that J.K. Rowling is a TERF, a trans-exclusionary

02:11.920 --> 02:15.740
radical feminist. TERFs are a component of the left that believe that trans women are

02:15.740 --> 02:20.120
not women, and do not have a place in female-only spaces. This puts them at odds with trans

02:20.120 --> 02:24.000
activists and gender abolitionists, two other components of the left that fight for trans

02:24.000 --> 02:28.560
equality and want to abolish the concept of men and women respectively. In my recent Christmas

02:28.560 --> 02:32.920
video about Mary TERFmas, a phrase Rowling made go viral over the holidays, I went into

02:32.920 --> 02:37.760
a bit more detail. The TLDR is that J.K. Rowling is most certainly a radical feminist. Her

02:37.760 --> 02:42.320
political activism revolves around women's liberation and attacking the patriarchy, specifically

02:42.320 --> 02:47.480
from a point of view that is strictly biologically female-centric, and for a long time she was

02:47.480 --> 02:51.940
the left's darling. Within the past decade, however, her brand of leftism has declined

02:51.940 --> 02:56.160
in favor of trans activism, specifically as intersectionalists have begun to see white

02:56.160 --> 03:00.860
women not as the victimized oppressed, but as entitled oppressors themselves. So for

03:00.860 --> 03:05.480
a while this put a lot of the rank-and-file lefties in a bind. We all remember those 2016

03:05.480 --> 03:09.240
protests against Donald Trump's then-new presidency were like, right? Leftoids comparing

03:09.240 --> 03:12.660
themselves to Dumbledore's Army and Trump to Voldemort, with the rest of us telling

03:12.660 --> 03:15.520
them to read another fucking book? Old memes, good times.

03:15.560 --> 03:19.520
When it comes to storytelling, leftists tend to claim rebellions against a corrupt tyrannical

03:19.520 --> 03:23.800
order. Harry Potter and Star Wars immediately come to mind, because those stories map onto

03:23.800 --> 03:28.160
revolutionary politics pretty well. They attempt to claim stories where they are the institutional

03:28.160 --> 03:32.120
power like Star Trek or Mass Effect, but those ones don't quite fit, and you can often

03:32.120 --> 03:36.280
find some leftoids decrying the lionization of those heroes because they're part of

03:36.280 --> 03:39.960
the system. And of course, their attempts to colonize stories where they clearly don't

03:39.960 --> 03:44.100
belong just seem petty and ridiculous. The point is, though, for the left-leaning terminally

03:44.100 --> 03:48.940
online culture warrior, Harry Potter was one of their go-to references for years. But

03:48.940 --> 03:51.380
now that the political winds have shifted, that's over.

03:51.380 --> 03:54.780
I mentioned in my White Nervosa video that the attempt to make Harry Potter owned by

03:54.780 --> 03:58.800
the fans instead of by JK Rowling because of her political views mirrors the attempt

03:58.800 --> 04:02.340
to delegitimize Scott Cawthon's creation of Five Nights at Freddy's. Not that it

04:02.340 --> 04:05.760
matters, though, because JK Rowling's still getting a big fat check every month. I remember

04:05.760 --> 04:10.020
seeing the trailer for Hogwarts Legacy like a year ago and remarking on stream that the

04:10.020 --> 04:13.960
trans activists were going to try to boycott the game. This is mainly because they were

04:13.960 --> 04:18.500
actually successful at boycotting the Fantastic Beasts movies, or at least they think they

04:18.500 --> 04:22.320
were. Personally, I think the main reason those movies failed is because they suck.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.140
But to the trans activists, it probably appears like their boycott was a success, so now it

04:26.140 --> 04:30.020
was time to go after Hogwarts Legacy. However, I never thought it would blow up this big,

04:30.020 --> 04:33.980
though. I don't think we need to go over every single tweet on this topic. Lots of

04:33.980 --> 04:37.660
other people have done that already. If you want to pause and read these moronic takes,

04:37.660 --> 04:41.160
be my guest. But they're all saying the same basic thing, and I would rather analyze

04:41.160 --> 04:45.540
it a little bit. Here's their logic. If you buy Hogwarts Legacy, you're killing trans

04:45.540 --> 04:49.700
people. Why? Because JK Rowling gets even more money from the game's success, which

04:49.700 --> 04:54.180
she will turn around and use to fund her TERF activism. And because TERF activism specifically

04:54.180 --> 04:59.140
excludes trans women, when JK Rowling decides to do activism with her money, like, for example,

04:59.140 --> 05:03.520
opening a female-only domestic violence shelter, that is a facility that won't help trans

05:03.520 --> 05:06.880
women, meaning there's less resources available to trans women than there could be if the

05:06.880 --> 05:10.040
shelter included them. Which means that trans women are now at a higher risk than they would

05:10.040 --> 05:13.120
have been, meaning that they're more likely to be stuck in a domestic violence situation,

05:13.120 --> 05:17.200
have to endure abuse, and be driven to drug use, prostitution, and suicide. The problem

05:17.200 --> 05:21.280
with this example is that it presupposes that trans women have a right to JK Rowling's

05:21.280 --> 05:24.700
activist money. And because JK Rowling refuses to give it to them, that's the same thing

05:24.700 --> 05:29.600
as directly killing trans women. And if you give JK Rowling money, by buying this game,

05:29.600 --> 05:33.360
you're killing them too. It's part of the wider logic that the existence of billionaires

05:33.360 --> 05:36.840
kills the poor, because the billionaires could be using their wealth to help them,

05:36.840 --> 05:40.240
and they don't. And so, if you support the billionaires through voluntary trade,

05:40.240 --> 05:44.960
you are part of the problem. This is where the phrase, no ethical consumption under capitalism,

05:44.960 --> 05:48.520
comes from. Because if you engage with the system, you uphold it, whether you want to or not.

05:48.520 --> 05:54.760
Now, this idea is what lies beneath a lot of the pro-theft, pro-looting, pro-riding ethics on the

05:54.760 --> 05:59.120
left. But it's hilarious to see people who sell a product say this phrase, since it implies you

05:59.120 --> 06:02.800
should have just stolen it from them. There's many examples of this. But to stay on topic,

06:02.880 --> 06:07.120
Emma Watson promoted a clothing line with the phrase, this is what a feminist looks like printed

06:07.120 --> 06:11.120
on them. But it turns out, the shirts were being made with sweatshop labor, and the women who made

06:11.120 --> 06:15.800
them earned a dollar an hour and slept 16 people to one bedroom. Karl Marx said at one point that

06:15.800 --> 06:20.520
if given the chance, capitalism will commodify the revolution, and in doing so, reroute revolutionary

06:20.520 --> 06:25.600
tendencies away from real change and towards purely symbolic efforts, like spending $25 on

06:25.600 --> 06:29.640
a Che Guevara or a feminist shirt, and feeling like your practice for the day is complete,

06:29.640 --> 06:33.400
while the systems of oppression remain in place. The problem with this point of view is that it

06:33.400 --> 06:37.760
goes directly against another commonly stated leftist viewpoint, often encapsulated by this

06:37.760 --> 06:41.600
comic, where the serf is suffering under the current system, and a smarmy internet asshole

06:41.600 --> 06:45.400
tells him he's being hypocritical for participating in the system, when he has to in order to survive.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.800
Cue the Vosch clip of him saying that socialists maximizing their wealth under capitalism is good.

06:59.640 --> 07:08.520
On the one hand, there's no ethical consumption under capitalism. All of your engagement with the

07:08.520 --> 07:12.560
system props it up, even if you are spreading an anti-capitalist message. And so, if you're going

07:12.560 --> 07:17.440
to oppose the system, you must do so with violence, not with collaboration. This is the Sorelian

07:17.440 --> 07:21.600
socialist view on violence. The Leninists also somewhat believe in this, though with a few

07:21.600 --> 07:25.800
caveats. Lenin thought that exploiting capitalist consumption to directly further the revolution

07:25.800 --> 07:29.360
was a good deal, famously saying, the last capitalist will sell us the rope that we hang

07:29.360 --> 07:33.760
him with. On the other hand, there's the idea that socialists maximizing their wealth and power

07:33.760 --> 07:39.000
within capitalism will give them a better position when the revolution comes. This is the Gramscian

07:39.000 --> 07:43.680
view, where socialists have a moral obligation to infiltrate liberal institutions, and once firmly

07:43.680 --> 07:48.240
entrenched, begin to use that institution's power to tilt the world more leftward. Movements like

07:48.240 --> 07:52.720
feminism, racial activism, and the like, serve to destabilize liberal sensibilities, making these

07:52.720 --> 07:56.880
institutions more vulnerable. Of course, no online leftward has ever read Georges Sorel,

07:56.880 --> 08:01.480
or Vladimir Lenin, or Antonia Gramsci. They have no idea that these two views, that there's no

08:01.480 --> 08:05.160
ethical consumption under capitalism, and that people should engage with liberal institutions

08:05.160 --> 08:08.760
to subvert them, are mutually exclusive in practice. But they don't care, because at the

08:08.760 --> 08:13.480
bottom of it is just hypocrisy. They want you to not buy Hogwarts Legacy because of a transphobia,

08:13.480 --> 08:18.040
and you're part of the problem if you refuse. However, even as they hate Jeff Bezos and Amazon's

08:18.040 --> 08:22.520
monopoly on everything, they still use Amazon Prime for that sweet two-day shipping. They

08:22.520 --> 08:26.160
still watch Twitch because their favorite lefty still streams there, and they still enjoy the

08:26.160 --> 08:30.240
boys on Prime Video for its subversive deconstruction of Americanism. They still shill

08:30.240 --> 08:34.160
for games like Overwatch or Valorant, made by companies that support absolutely terrible

08:34.160 --> 08:38.200
regimes overseas, involved in the suppression of racial, religious, and sexual minorities.

08:38.200 --> 08:41.680
They're still addicted to Twitter, where their constant use supports one of the people they hate

08:41.680 --> 08:46.240
the most, Elon Musk. They still use a phone built by child slave labor that the government uses to

08:46.240 --> 08:49.840
track their every location, unless they've got a Fairphone like I do. All of these people

08:49.840 --> 08:54.440
screeching about Harry Potter and no ethical consumption are literally unethically consuming

08:54.440 --> 08:58.960
under capitalism themselves, with the excuse that they have to do it. But you guys need a new iPhone

08:58.960 --> 09:03.080
or Amazon Prime just as much as the rest of us needs Hogwarts Legacy. The fact of the matter is,

09:03.080 --> 09:06.600
you do it because you want to do it, because it's convenient, because it's cheap. That's

09:06.600 --> 09:11.440
the material analysis. The reply of, you need a phone, you don't need Hogwarts Legacy, is stupid,

09:11.440 --> 09:15.240
because that doesn't make the phone more ethically made. Again, unless it's a Fairphone. If there's

09:15.280 --> 09:18.800
anything I've learned from environmental activists, it's that your needs do not make

09:18.800 --> 09:23.360
your consumption ethical, and that leaving your needs unfulfilled is the only moral choice. But

09:23.360 --> 09:27.580
even then, the environmental activists tend to excuse massive amounts of waste in the service

09:27.580 --> 09:32.240
of their cause, while demanding that you turn off the gas. All of this is rooted in hypocrisy. They

09:32.240 --> 09:36.760
don't want to stop exploitation, they just want to be the ones doing the exploiting. Of course,

09:36.760 --> 09:41.120
I'm speaking about this entire topic within the Left's moral framework. Personally, I don't give

09:41.280 --> 09:45.320
it. I don't think any of this is exploitative or immoral. I'm a capitalist. Play the game,

09:45.320 --> 09:49.200
have fun. It's not your responsibility what other people do with your money after it's changed

09:49.200 --> 09:53.520
hands, any more than it is their responsibility what you do with their product, after you own it.

09:53.520 --> 09:57.960
And most of the normies agree with me, because the push to boycott Hogwarts Legacy absolutely

09:57.960 --> 10:02.040
backfired. Calls for streamers to not cover the game, for players not to play it, for the whole

10:02.040 --> 10:07.560
thing to just silently go away, it all fell on deaf ears. Hogwarts Legacy peaked at 1.3 million

10:07.800 --> 10:12.800
viewers on Twitch, the highest view count for any single-player game on the service. Twitch,

10:12.800 --> 10:17.120
the capitalist collaborationist that they are, partnered with Portkey Games to allow viewers

10:17.120 --> 10:20.720
to get items in their own game for watching streamers play it, as long as they had their

10:20.720 --> 10:25.560
accounts linked up. The Hogwarts branded controller immediately sold out upon release. Hogwarts

10:25.560 --> 10:30.600
Legacy smashed sales records on PS5, Xbox, and Steam, with the Steam page being particularly

10:30.600 --> 10:35.200
hilarious. Trans activists try to slap the game with tags such as transphobia and genocide

10:35.240 --> 10:39.120
simulator, and gamers just leaned into it, turning the comments section into a shitposting

10:39.120 --> 10:42.960
battleground. The truth is, people don't care about leftist moral sensibilities anymore. They

10:42.960 --> 10:45.840
don't give a shit. They're tired of cancel culture, they're tired of being told what to do

10:45.840 --> 10:50.120
and say and think by moral busybodies, they threw off the chains of the religious dogmatic right,

10:50.120 --> 10:53.760
and now they're throwing off the chains of the woke oppressive left. Of course, the activist

10:53.760 --> 10:58.760
wailed and gnashed their teeth in response. How dare the gamer chuds not fall into line! It's

10:58.760 --> 11:02.560
always funny when this happens. I remember what it was like early in gamergate, where the game

11:02.600 --> 11:06.840
journals and woke devs tried to spin consumer boycotts of their work as oppressive because it

11:06.840 --> 11:11.280
denied them resources. Now they're crying that their own boycott failed, and that gamers are

11:11.280 --> 11:15.480
apparently twisting themselves into pretzels to justify their behavior. It's always about

11:15.480 --> 11:19.720
hypocrisy with these people. The funniest thing about their boycott is that it likely contributed

11:19.720 --> 11:24.200
to the game's success. Hogwarts is being talked about like Elden Ring was when that game launched,

11:24.200 --> 11:27.840
another title that progressives tried to boycott, that time with the smokescreen of accessibility,

11:27.840 --> 11:31.320
and Elden Ring is a way better game. Once the Hogwarts Legacy boycott failed,

11:31.440 --> 11:35.480
the trans activists turned their ire onto the streamers who dared ignore their commands.

11:35.480 --> 11:39.840
The first blow was struck with the website HaveTheyStreamedThatWizardGame.com, a site

11:39.840 --> 11:43.600
that you could plug any twitch stream into and it would tell you if they played Hogwarts Legacy.

11:43.600 --> 11:48.000
This was built to be a simple boycott tool that the progs would use, but it was rapidly turned

11:48.000 --> 11:52.560
into a tool for people to find streamers playing the game. One of my mod's shitposts went viral,

11:52.560 --> 11:56.720
specifically because the trans activists initially took it to mean that she was one of them. The

11:56.720 --> 12:00.400
site was actually pretty stupid, because all it measured is if you changed the game setting on

12:00.400 --> 12:03.920
your stream to Hogwarts Legacy. You can change that setting without streaming the game, or you

12:03.920 --> 12:07.400
can stream the game without the setting, and the site wouldn't know. In the end, the site shut

12:07.400 --> 12:11.440
down after just a few days because everyone realized it was a fucking joke. After that

12:11.440 --> 12:15.600
failure, the trans activists moved on to harassing streamers for playing it. There's multiple viral

12:15.600 --> 12:19.360
clips of leftoids raiding streamers' chat rooms to shit on them for daring to play the game.

12:31.400 --> 12:38.240
Go ahead, talk about it. I will ban you so fast, I don't give two fucks. This is my escape, this has always been my escape.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.240
I love your face.

12:39.240 --> 12:44.840
It will continue to be my escape. Fuck right on off if you have a problem with me playing this game.

12:44.840 --> 12:50.200
I'm almost like thinking of just like either going offline or like, I'm barely into the second combat

12:50.200 --> 12:55.080
here. And every time I look at chat, it's just, the conversation is just like, bothering me.

12:55.080 --> 13:00.040
Maybe we can do like a pure, a be right back, like a, like a little break or something?

13:00.080 --> 13:03.880
You can take a break if you want. I'll just stop talking and I'll just go fight and do the combat.

13:09.160 --> 13:10.480
Y'all done did it now.

13:11.360 --> 13:17.840
Harry Potter and anyone that plays it is a bigot. Oh, you're just a weird person. And a bully.

13:18.360 --> 13:25.200
I'll tell you guys to end this right now. If you go around telling people who bought this game simply

13:25.240 --> 13:30.160
for the enjoyment of playing the game, no other reason, you're an asshole. Plain and simple. You

13:30.160 --> 13:36.920
are a fucking asshole. If you go around bothering people, you are a dick, you're an asshole. You are

13:36.920 --> 13:41.600
the scum that people walk in the street and want to pass by as quickly as possible. Let's be clear,

13:41.600 --> 13:45.440
streamers have a ban button and they should be using it. Crying over this sort of thing is kind

13:45.440 --> 13:50.120
of cringe. But at the same time, this is absolutely demented behavior. None of these people are

13:50.120 --> 13:53.560
actually viewers of the streamer in question. And even if they were, that doesn't give them control

13:53.560 --> 13:58.680
over the stream. The activists are literally just bullies of the exact same caliber they claim to

13:58.680 --> 14:02.920
oppose. When that tactic didn't work, the trans activists resorted to simply spoiling the game.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.600
I'm not going to read off the spoilers, but I am going to display them on screen. So if you're only

14:06.600 --> 14:09.680
listening to this in the background and don't want to be spoiled, you'll be all right. The

14:09.680 --> 14:14.920
Prague's last ditch attempt to ruin everyone's fun was to simply post the endgame twist all over

14:14.920 --> 14:19.240
social media. This doesn't stop streams. It doesn't make JK Rowling any poorer. This is just

14:19.320 --> 14:24.200
being spiteful. This is the person screaming stop having fun. Okay, spoilers over. You can look back

14:24.200 --> 14:28.640
now. Now I'm pretty sure that Portkey Games knew the shitshow was coming and added in a trans

14:28.640 --> 14:32.480
character as token representation. It didn't work though, because the Wokes ignored it and the

14:32.480 --> 14:36.480
Normies just saw her as being shoehorned in. Funnily enough, following in the JK Rowling

14:36.480 --> 14:40.600
tradition of having weird racialized names for all of her characters, the trans woman is named

14:40.600 --> 14:45.760
Sarona Ryan, which a lot of trans activists took as a slap in the face. Get it, sir? Sarona?

14:45.840 --> 14:49.920
There's a deeper problem though with the call for trans representation. How do you know if a

14:49.920 --> 14:54.120
character's trans? If they're the ideal trans woman, then they're passing, they're stealthing,

14:54.120 --> 14:57.480
and you shouldn't know that they're trans, unless there's a sex scene with them. If they're not

14:57.480 --> 15:01.200
passing, if they look manly or they have a non-feminine voice, then they're viewed as an

15:01.200 --> 15:07.260
ugly caricature of a trans woman. The only way to make non-sexual, non-grotesque trans representation

15:07.260 --> 15:12.080
is to shoehorn in the fact that she's trans into dialogue, to have a cringy pronoun scene or some

15:12.080 --> 15:16.680
shit. There was also a smaller side controversy about anti-semitism, where the progs believe that

15:16.680 --> 15:21.020
the goblins are meant to be Jewish because they're greedy, short, hook-nosed little creatures who

15:21.020 --> 15:25.160
love money. Listen, I don't see a Jewish person when I look at this picture, and if you do,

15:25.160 --> 15:28.800
you're probably the fucking racist here, not me. But to be honest, there's not much of a story

15:28.800 --> 15:33.540
here. However, it was funny seeing Vivian Wolf twisting herself into pretzels, explaining how

15:33.540 --> 15:38.640
goblins were Judeo-Bolsheviks, therefore making JK Rowling a Nazi, because the goblins don't

15:38.640 --> 15:42.000
believe in the concept of trade. That is a rabbit hole I'll have to cover another time, though.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.760
All of this stuff was used as justification for the boycott, but apparently none of it applied if

15:46.760 --> 15:51.840
you had the correct politics. Again, hypocrisy. As left-leaning game journos, bloggers, and content

15:51.840 --> 15:56.720
creators all had a field day talking about Hogwarts Legacy, earning clicks and money virtue signaling

15:56.720 --> 16:00.440
about how bad it is, how terrible you are if you play it. They are as much a part of the machine

16:00.440 --> 16:04.600
as everyone else is. As I am. The difference is, they're leftist, therefore they're allowed.

16:04.600 --> 16:10.240
Apparently you can engage in exploitative systems if your politics are correct. It is all hypocrisy.

16:10.240 --> 16:14.360
At the end of the day, Hogwarts Legacy appears to be a pretty good game. It's not a 10 out of 10 or

16:14.360 --> 16:17.720
anything, but certainly something you can pick up to get yourself through the dry spell of new

16:17.720 --> 16:21.280
releases that always plagues the first few months of the year. Most of the people talking about the

16:21.280 --> 16:25.280
game right now are doing so because of the controversy, the failed boycott, the activist

16:25.280 --> 16:29.280
screeching. The game itself doesn't actually warrant this much attention. And because I

16:29.280 --> 16:33.280
personally think that progressive morals and sensibilities are retarded, I'm going to be

16:33.320 --> 16:36.800
streaming Hogwarts Legacy right after this video comes out. So make sure you tune in,

16:36.800 --> 16:40.240
guys. Let's shit on the leftoids together. I'll see you there. I love you.
