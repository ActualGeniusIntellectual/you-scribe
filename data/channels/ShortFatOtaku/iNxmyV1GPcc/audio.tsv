0	5680	Hello my friends, welcome to the newest SJ Weekly. I feel like I owe you an explanation.
5680	11440	I took up this project, the whole SJ Weekly's thing, because primarily I wanted to get something
11440	17120	out on the channel regularly. At least one video a week, because these happen every Sunday,
17120	22560	and I've kept that so far. Through sickness and famine I've kept to it. But you'll probably
22560	28880	notice that the last video that I put up, not counting this current SJ Weekly, was
28880	33840	last week's SJ Weekly. I was hoping that I'd be able to get at least one video out a week to
34720	40240	break up the SJ Weekly's, whether it be a dumping with Scrump, or a dissecting a degenerate,
40240	45280	or something. Something that'll break up the two of them, so you'd at least get two videos a week.
45280	48800	I think that's a fair upload schedule, two videos a week for this channel.
50080	56320	And I haven't been able to do it. Not this week anyway. In the last episode I talked about making
56400	61840	the Alex Jones video. But as it turns out, as I was writing it, and as I was recording it,
61840	65920	and then as I found more stuff and more things happened, and I re-recorded parts of it,
66880	74880	it became a much bigger video. The scope increased by a fair amount. It's now called
74880	82160	the anti-social media, and it's basically a complete expose of all of the things that
82160	88160	social media does wrong. And there is quite a bit of it. There's a lot to go over. Alex Jones
88160	92000	might have been the catalyst, but it certainly wasn't the beginning, and it certainly isn't the
92000	96320	end. So I think this is actually a very important video that I definitely want to get right.
96960	102800	I'd say I'm about two-thirds done it, and you'll probably see it in the middle of the week. And
102800	107440	people have been asking about the next dumping with Scrump. Actually, I'm probably going to be
107440	112160	recording it right after I'm done this, unless Scrump is off fucking traps or something.
112880	117680	I'll be doing it this afternoon, so you'll probably see that a day or two after anti-social
117680	125360	media. So content's coming, guys. Thank you for being patient. Oh, and of course, we have to start
125360	131920	the morning off, even though it's now 12 12 pm. I woke up late today. We have to start the morning
131920	146880	off with the coffee. It's good stuff today. I left the spoon in this time. There's a guy who
146880	153680	wanted a coffee with a spoon in the mug. There it is. There's my spoon. So today, the coffee is with
153680	159120	spoon. But let's get to the nonsense. To kick things off, here's an article that I had saved
159120	163600	up. Like the Alex Jones video and anti-social media that it would eventually morph into,
163600	167840	I ended up not using it in the video because it just didn't really fit, because this is more of a
167840	174800	social media success story. And let's read it. MySpace Tom beat Facebook in the long run.
174800	180800	Wouldn't you rather be a rich nobody than whatever Mark Zuckerberg is? And I guess the honest truth
180800	186000	is yes. I mean, nobody cares about MySpace anymore, and nobody knows who runs MySpace.
186560	191440	But he just, I assume, you know, based on him being called a rich nobody, I assume he paid out,
191440	196400	he got his money, and he just kind of fucked off and now enjoys his life privately. That is the
196400	202240	ideal, isn't it? My MySpace profile was abandoned when, at the ripe age of 18, I decided it was just
202240	207600	a little too juvenile. The glittering gifts affixed to every page, the garish custom designs,
207600	214320	the pressure on maintaining your top eight. By 2006, Facebook offered a cleaner social experience.
214320	219920	By 2009, Twitter offered a more casual one. MySpace was a complete relic by this point,
219920	225520	even though only a few years had passed since its launch. I do have a fondness for, you know,
225520	233920	that old Web 1.0 glittery gif era of the internet. It was very basic and very ugly, but sometimes you
233920	240800	can go back and find old pages that still look like that, and it, uh, sometimes it really brings
240800	245600	back some old memories that are, that are at least decent ones. And hey, I don't know if you
245600	250080	guys know this, but if you go back and watch, like, the very beginning of the, the Marvel
250080	255120	Cinematic Universe, the, I think the first Iron Man film was the beginning, right? Iron Man 1.
255120	259120	When Tony Stark's in the vehicle with, with the soldiers and the, and the soldiers, like,
259120	264160	taking selfies with him with his phone, Tony Stark actually says, don't put this on your
264160	269760	MySpace profile because at that point, strangely enough, MySpace was bigger than Facebook. It's
269760	274960	kind of a weird blast of the past. If you ever go back and watch the entire Marvel Cinematic
274960	280480	Universe in order one day, you'll notice some strange things back there. Back in 2005, long
280480	287520	before MySpace burned out, its founder, Tom Anderson, sold the site for $580 million to
287520	292160	Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. While his site was becoming a punchline during the rise of
292160	297280	Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and the other social media networks we now use every day, Anderson
297280	301920	disappeared entirely from the tech scene. Now he travels the world, documenting his visits to
301920	305920	exotic locations. Sounds like he did good for himself. He knew exactly when it was right to
305920	310560	cash out. Contrast that with what's currently happening to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg,
310560	316080	who's on day two of being grilled by a Senate committee for Facebook's role in haphazardly
316080	320880	collecting all of our personal data and possibly swinging the 2016 presidential election towards
320880	325520	Donald Trump. What was supposed to be a basic networking tool has now become one of the chief
325520	329920	mediators of how people interact with each other and the world around them, and how information is
329920	334880	absorbed and disseminated on the internet. It's now apparent that Facebook and Zuckerberg didn't
334880	339600	really consider any of this when aggressively pursuing growth, and now we're all screwed as
339600	344640	we try to untangle the consequences. I actually have a lot to say on this topic in my upcoming
344640	350800	video, and you'll have to wait to see it then. However, I will say this. Despite Facebook's
350800	356960	obviously left-leaning slant, they did have a major role in swinging the election towards
356960	361840	Donald Trump. I think there's enough evidence to show that, and also there's enough evidence to
361840	368320	show that Facebook has no moral compass aside from growing itself. And I have... you'll have to see
368320	373680	the video. You'll have to watch it. MySpace Tom, his most recent Instagram post from seven days ago,
373680	378240	is a giveaway for a stay at an Iceland hotel. He doesn't have to issue any terse statements about
378240	382880	his company's commitment to foistering a healthy society. He doesn't have to sit on a booster seat
382880	387680	for seven hours and take dipshit questions from a procession of Senate ghouls. He isn't worth as
387680	392800	much money as Zuckerberg, of course, but unless you're an oil baron, 580 million is enough to
392800	397040	tide you over for the length of your lifetime, and your children's lifetime, and your children's
397040	403360	children's lifetime, and so on, even after taxes. And yes, being that rich is good for nobody,
403360	407200	but without getting into an argument about the perils of capitalism, we can agree that,
407200	412960	personally speaking, Anderson is having a much better go of things. Yeah, I'd say so too. And
412960	416400	it's not even because he cashed out, though cashing out was obviously the right thing to do,
417200	424000	it's because Zuckerberg either didn't have a dream or a goal or a passion to begin with,
424960	429520	or it was the wrong passion, it was like a one that served some kind of evil purpose,
429520	436640	or he lost sight of it. In any case, Zuckerberg is now literally the alien that everyone thinks he
436640	442720	is. But speaking of people not understanding the situation that they're in, someone vandalized
442720	452320	Burnaby's rainbow crosswalk. Hold on, read the tagline here. Someone painted a green question
452320	459120	mark and a cloud on Burnaby's first rainbow crosswalk overnight. The crosswalk was installed
459120	464720	Thursday by the city of Burnaby in anticipation of Burnaby Pride event on Saturday. Now,
466880	471280	I don't know if this is a cloud, guys. I don't know if you recognize the symbol here.
475360	479760	While the crosswalk will be repaired in time for tomorrow's Pride Street party,
479760	484960	McGowan said the vandalism is a good reminder of the work that still needs to be done to ensure
484960	491680	the LGBTQ2S Plus community feels welcome and safe in Burnaby.
491680	499440	Okay, this is an example of the internet leaking into real life,
500480	506720	and I think this is not a slur. This is not like some kind of anti-gay individual spray painting
506720	512640	something like an obvious anti-gay slogan or slur or image. This was a fucking meme,
513200	519040	and you got memed on. But speaking of ridiculous things leaking over into reality, Millennial
519040	526560	Couple bikes near ISIS territory thinking humans are kind and gets killed. Evil is a make believe
526560	531920	concept we've invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans. An idealistic
531920	537840	young American couple was killed in an Islamic State claimed terrorist attack last month while
537840	544000	on a cycling trip around the world. I mean, obviously you have to be sad because people died,
544800	551440	but there has to be some kind of Darwin Award situation involved in this, right? Like you can't
551440	556720	simply think that all humans are the same, everyone's just fine, and that you can just go out
556720	562080	into the world with like waving a flag of peace and then someone's not going to eventually come
562080	570320	and kill you. It's a ridiculous notion. I mean, these two, as sad as it is, they were complete
570320	598640	fucking idiots. And you know what? I actually agree with him there, you know?
601280	604960	I am actually able to catch more of those things and it's quite nice.
604960	608800	You read the papers and you're led to believe that the world is a big scary place.
608800	614400	People, the narrative goes, are not to be trusted. People are bad, people are evil. I don't buy it.
614400	618320	Evil is a make believe concept we've invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans
618320	623120	holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own. By and large, humans
623120	628160	are kind. Self-interested sometimes, myopic sometimes, but kind. Generous and wonderful
628160	635600	and kind. That's all true. What is equally true is that sometimes humans will hold
635600	640960	values and beliefs and perspectives that require them to kill you. You know, kill the Kefir
640960	647520	wherever you find him. I'm sure there is obviously a good side to even the worst supporters of ISIS
647520	651680	because that is just the nature of humanity. But the good side isn't what you need to be
651680	656880	focused on. However, their dream trip came to a tragic and gruesome end when they got
656880	661680	to Tajikistan, a weak state with a known terrorist threat that shares a border with
661680	666800	Afghanistan, where ISIS and other terrorist groups are highly active. They were riding
666800	671680	their bikes through the country on July 29th when a car rammed them, according to CBS News.
671680	677280	Five men got out of the car and stabbed the couple to death along with two other cyclists,
677280	682080	one from Switzerland and the other from the Netherlands. Two days later,
682080	687120	ISIS released a video showing the same men sitting in front of the group's black flag.
687120	690000	They looked at the camera and vowed to kill disbelievers.
704000	708240	Some conservatives have framed the tragedy as a cautionary tale about not just the perils of
708240	715120	travel but also naivete in general. I mean, traveling generally isn't that dangerous,
715120	719440	of course it all depends on where you go, but yeah, being naive is very dangerous.
719440	725200	Some liberals, for their part, view Austin and Gahaganan as simply unfortunate. Experts on the
725200	730560	region told the Washington Post, Central Asia generally is fairly safe. Yeah, I don't fucking
730560	735120	buy that for one second. But speaking of the radical left having a very disconnected view
735120	742560	of reality, here's an article by Holly Brockwell of Gadjet. Men, women gamers are not trying to get
742560	747600	in your pants, they just want to play. And she wrote this for Metro UK, presumably because her
747600	755200	own outlet, Gadjet, is actually quite small right now. Now, I actually somewhat know Holly, she's
755200	760800	a friend of a friend, and I've learned, I haven't really spoken to her, but I've learned a lot
760800	766320	through this friend of a friend of what she's really like. And apparently she's actually not
766320	772080	an insane leftist, she just virtue signals a whole bunch, and she's in fact made a career on virtue
772080	777200	signaling. However, there have been some things where I would definitely have sided with her in
777200	783520	the past, like, she had to fight the NHS a lot over in the UK in order to get sterilized because
783520	788960	she doesn't want children, and I think that that is a travesty. Despite what you may think about
788960	793760	whether or not people should be having kids, I think we can all agree that people should have
793760	799200	the self-determination to control their life. And if she doesn't want kids, you may think that
799200	804720	that's a mistake, but that's her right. She may come to regret it, but that's her responsibility,
804720	810240	not anybody else's. She may not, she may know what she wants, and you know what? Once you're
810240	816320	of age, once you're 18, that's that. You know, make your own decisions and take responsibility
816320	820880	for those decisions. The government should not be stepping in to stop them. But that's just my
820880	827360	rant on sterilization. Let's actually get to Holly's article here. This week, prominent games
827360	832640	streamer Ninja stated that he won't game with women in case it causes problems in his marriage,
832640	837680	and female gamers everywhere rolled their eyes. Now, I reported on this last week,
837680	842160	if you remember. And I think what Holly's missing here is that it was never about
842880	848560	the other women, it was about what his community would think regarding him streaming with other
848560	853680	women. It was never about the woman. I mean, presumably he knows if he's going to cheat
853680	859600	on his wife or not, right? And presumably the woman would know if she's interested in him,
859600	864720	but it's not about them, it's about his community. He has a huge community, and internet communities
864720	869360	of that size are likely to just, you know, slap couples together and start shipping them,
869360	872560	whether or not it's actually true, and I think he just wanted to avoid that.
872560	877760	It was about public perception, not women. To be fair to Ninja, he does seem to know this,
877760	884240	but he's still wrong because his solution isn't to re-educate the men, it's to ban the women. One,
884880	894720	Ninja has no obligation to tell his fans what to think. And two, Ninja has no obligation to
894720	899520	have people on his stream that he doesn't want to have on his stream. And that's that. It's not
899520	905360	that he's banning the women, it's that he's banning everyone he fucking likes. I said this
905360	910400	last week, but just because he has a large platform does not mean that there's any kind
910400	915200	of moral imperative to push your politics or your point of view on it. This is particularly
915200	920000	disappointing because with his platform, Ninja is in a perfect position to make a real positive
920000	924800	difference to the still depressingly sexist world of Twitch streaming. You know what?
925840	933440	Maybe. But he is under no requirement to do so. He's there to stream games. He's not there to
933440	939440	change the world. He's not there to do what you think is morally correct. Can you imagine if
939440	943040	anyone came into your gaming group and was like, yo, you gotta add some women to this,
943040	947120	regardless of the dynamics of the group, regardless of the skill of the women involved,
947120	951760	regardless of any of these things that may actually destroy the gaming group,
951760	957200	whether it's Fortnite or any other kind of game or like a tabletop situation or whatever,
957200	960160	you just gotta add some women in there to make it 50-50 parity. You just have to.
961280	965600	And then you're just like, fuck your group up. That would be ridiculous, right? But Ninja is
965600	970560	the biggest Fortnite streamer in the world. He probably wants to have like a well polished team.
970560	975840	And I'm sure there are very good female Fortnite players out there, but he probably hasn't
975840	983120	encountered one that would outweigh the risks of having your entire community go apeshit on you.
983120	987760	All right. I don't think this is Ninja's fault here. If anything, like if you wanted to put
987760	992880	blame on somebody and I don't think anybody's to blame, but if you really wanted to blame somebody,
992880	998160	I think it's his community's fault. And even then you can't go to his community and be like,
998160	1001920	re-educate yourself shitlords. Like it's not going to work like that. All right.
1001920	1007600	He does what he wants. His community does what they want. And that's that. Holly, you can't just
1008400	1013920	be people's moral nannies. I mean, you didn't want kids. So how come you're trying to mother
1013920	1018160	these people? And of course there are some, some really trite things in this article,
1018160	1023680	but in this case, it's pretty, it's pretty clear who can't see past the chromosomes. It's an Xbox,
1023680	1032160	not an XY box for goodness sake. Well, you know what? You know what? It's a game boy,
1032720	1037840	not a game girl. See, I can do it too. This is stupid. Let's move on.
1037840	1043120	New Westminster terrorist attack as driver crashes into cyclists outside parliament.
1043120	1046720	For some reason, my fucking ad blocker stopped working. I had ad block installed. It was right
1046720	1052000	up here. Now it's just, it's just not there anymore. Oops. The police have confirmed they
1052000	1057600	are treating the incident as a terrorist incident and the number of armed and unarmed police on the
1057600	1062560	streets of central London will be increased. Okay. So I think we've all heard about this
1062560	1068560	story before, right? There's some kind of truck of peace in the UK, ransom people over, maybe
1068560	1073360	someone gets stabbed, maybe someone gets shot, you know, just, just daily life in London right now.
1073360	1076960	And, and the police are treating it as a terrorist incident. That's how it should be,
1076960	1081760	but that's not the story that I'm covering. I'm covering this story. Trump tweets on London
1081760	1088560	terrorist attack as investigation gets underway. President Donald Trump on Tuesday again,
1088560	1094080	seized on what he called a terrorist attack in London to call for tougher anti-terror measures.
1094640	1100960	Even though the incident was still in the early stages of investigation, the police themselves
1100960	1106800	called it a fucking terrorist attack. This is not something you can attack Trump for. I think it's
1106800	1112800	really telling that CNN, rather than reporting on what happened in the terrorist attack,
1112800	1118560	rather than at the very least confirming that it was a terrorist attack because the police said it
1118560	1123600	was in fact being treated as a terrorist attack. This article was written and the article was
1123600	1129520	about how wrong it was of Trump to tweet like it was a terrorist attack and how wrong it was
1129520	1135360	for Trump to seize the opportunity and say, Oh, look at this latest terrorist attack in London.
1135360	1142800	We need to increase security. Scoring ideological points against Trump is more important to CNN
1142800	1148800	than reporting on a legit terrorist attack where people got killed. Don't forget that.
1148800	1150960	This is what CNN is now.
