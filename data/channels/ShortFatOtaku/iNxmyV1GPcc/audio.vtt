00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Hello my friends, welcome to the newest SJ Weekly. I feel like I owe you an explanation.

00:05.680 --> 00:11.440
I took up this project, the whole SJ Weekly's thing, because primarily I wanted to get something

00:11.440 --> 00:17.120
out on the channel regularly. At least one video a week, because these happen every Sunday,

00:17.120 --> 00:22.560
and I've kept that so far. Through sickness and famine I've kept to it. But you'll probably

00:22.560 --> 00:28.880
notice that the last video that I put up, not counting this current SJ Weekly, was

00:28.880 --> 00:33.840
last week's SJ Weekly. I was hoping that I'd be able to get at least one video out a week to

00:34.720 --> 00:40.240
break up the SJ Weekly's, whether it be a dumping with Scrump, or a dissecting a degenerate,

00:40.240 --> 00:45.280
or something. Something that'll break up the two of them, so you'd at least get two videos a week.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.800
I think that's a fair upload schedule, two videos a week for this channel.

00:50.080 --> 00:56.320
And I haven't been able to do it. Not this week anyway. In the last episode I talked about making

00:56.400 --> 01:01.840
the Alex Jones video. But as it turns out, as I was writing it, and as I was recording it,

01:01.840 --> 01:05.920
and then as I found more stuff and more things happened, and I re-recorded parts of it,

01:06.880 --> 01:14.880
it became a much bigger video. The scope increased by a fair amount. It's now called

01:14.880 --> 01:22.160
the anti-social media, and it's basically a complete expose of all of the things that

01:22.160 --> 01:28.160
social media does wrong. And there is quite a bit of it. There's a lot to go over. Alex Jones

01:28.160 --> 01:32.000
might have been the catalyst, but it certainly wasn't the beginning, and it certainly isn't the

01:32.000 --> 01:36.320
end. So I think this is actually a very important video that I definitely want to get right.

01:36.960 --> 01:42.800
I'd say I'm about two-thirds done it, and you'll probably see it in the middle of the week. And

01:42.800 --> 01:47.440
people have been asking about the next dumping with Scrump. Actually, I'm probably going to be

01:47.440 --> 01:52.160
recording it right after I'm done this, unless Scrump is off fucking traps or something.

01:52.880 --> 01:57.680
I'll be doing it this afternoon, so you'll probably see that a day or two after anti-social

01:57.680 --> 02:05.360
media. So content's coming, guys. Thank you for being patient. Oh, and of course, we have to start

02:05.360 --> 02:11.920
the morning off, even though it's now 12 12 pm. I woke up late today. We have to start the morning

02:11.920 --> 02:26.880
off with the coffee. It's good stuff today. I left the spoon in this time. There's a guy who

02:26.880 --> 02:33.680
wanted a coffee with a spoon in the mug. There it is. There's my spoon. So today, the coffee is with

02:33.680 --> 02:39.120
spoon. But let's get to the nonsense. To kick things off, here's an article that I had saved

02:39.120 --> 02:43.600
up. Like the Alex Jones video and anti-social media that it would eventually morph into,

02:43.600 --> 02:47.840
I ended up not using it in the video because it just didn't really fit, because this is more of a

02:47.840 --> 02:54.800
social media success story. And let's read it. MySpace Tom beat Facebook in the long run.

02:54.800 --> 03:00.800
Wouldn't you rather be a rich nobody than whatever Mark Zuckerberg is? And I guess the honest truth

03:00.800 --> 03:06.000
is yes. I mean, nobody cares about MySpace anymore, and nobody knows who runs MySpace.

03:06.560 --> 03:11.440
But he just, I assume, you know, based on him being called a rich nobody, I assume he paid out,

03:11.440 --> 03:16.400
he got his money, and he just kind of fucked off and now enjoys his life privately. That is the

03:16.400 --> 03:22.240
ideal, isn't it? My MySpace profile was abandoned when, at the ripe age of 18, I decided it was just

03:22.240 --> 03:27.600
a little too juvenile. The glittering gifts affixed to every page, the garish custom designs,

03:27.600 --> 03:34.320
the pressure on maintaining your top eight. By 2006, Facebook offered a cleaner social experience.

03:34.320 --> 03:39.920
By 2009, Twitter offered a more casual one. MySpace was a complete relic by this point,

03:39.920 --> 03:45.520
even though only a few years had passed since its launch. I do have a fondness for, you know,

03:45.520 --> 03:53.920
that old Web 1.0 glittery gif era of the internet. It was very basic and very ugly, but sometimes you

03:53.920 --> 04:00.800
can go back and find old pages that still look like that, and it, uh, sometimes it really brings

04:00.800 --> 04:05.600
back some old memories that are, that are at least decent ones. And hey, I don't know if you

04:05.600 --> 04:10.080
guys know this, but if you go back and watch, like, the very beginning of the, the Marvel

04:10.080 --> 04:15.120
Cinematic Universe, the, I think the first Iron Man film was the beginning, right? Iron Man 1.

04:15.120 --> 04:19.120
When Tony Stark's in the vehicle with, with the soldiers and the, and the soldiers, like,

04:19.120 --> 04:24.160
taking selfies with him with his phone, Tony Stark actually says, don't put this on your

04:24.160 --> 04:29.760
MySpace profile because at that point, strangely enough, MySpace was bigger than Facebook. It's

04:29.760 --> 04:34.960
kind of a weird blast of the past. If you ever go back and watch the entire Marvel Cinematic

04:34.960 --> 04:40.480
Universe in order one day, you'll notice some strange things back there. Back in 2005, long

04:40.480 --> 04:47.520
before MySpace burned out, its founder, Tom Anderson, sold the site for $580 million to

04:47.520 --> 04:52.160
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. While his site was becoming a punchline during the rise of

04:52.160 --> 04:57.280
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and the other social media networks we now use every day, Anderson

04:57.280 --> 05:01.920
disappeared entirely from the tech scene. Now he travels the world, documenting his visits to

05:01.920 --> 05:05.920
exotic locations. Sounds like he did good for himself. He knew exactly when it was right to

05:05.920 --> 05:10.560
cash out. Contrast that with what's currently happening to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg,

05:10.560 --> 05:16.080
who's on day two of being grilled by a Senate committee for Facebook's role in haphazardly

05:16.080 --> 05:20.880
collecting all of our personal data and possibly swinging the 2016 presidential election towards

05:20.880 --> 05:25.520
Donald Trump. What was supposed to be a basic networking tool has now become one of the chief

05:25.520 --> 05:29.920
mediators of how people interact with each other and the world around them, and how information is

05:29.920 --> 05:34.880
absorbed and disseminated on the internet. It's now apparent that Facebook and Zuckerberg didn't

05:34.880 --> 05:39.600
really consider any of this when aggressively pursuing growth, and now we're all screwed as

05:39.600 --> 05:44.640
we try to untangle the consequences. I actually have a lot to say on this topic in my upcoming

05:44.640 --> 05:50.800
video, and you'll have to wait to see it then. However, I will say this. Despite Facebook's

05:50.800 --> 05:56.960
obviously left-leaning slant, they did have a major role in swinging the election towards

05:56.960 --> 06:01.840
Donald Trump. I think there's enough evidence to show that, and also there's enough evidence to

06:01.840 --> 06:08.320
show that Facebook has no moral compass aside from growing itself. And I have... you'll have to see

06:08.320 --> 06:13.680
the video. You'll have to watch it. MySpace Tom, his most recent Instagram post from seven days ago,

06:13.680 --> 06:18.240
is a giveaway for a stay at an Iceland hotel. He doesn't have to issue any terse statements about

06:18.240 --> 06:22.880
his company's commitment to foistering a healthy society. He doesn't have to sit on a booster seat

06:22.880 --> 06:27.680
for seven hours and take dipshit questions from a procession of Senate ghouls. He isn't worth as

06:27.680 --> 06:32.800
much money as Zuckerberg, of course, but unless you're an oil baron, 580 million is enough to

06:32.800 --> 06:37.040
tide you over for the length of your lifetime, and your children's lifetime, and your children's

06:37.040 --> 06:43.360
children's lifetime, and so on, even after taxes. And yes, being that rich is good for nobody,

06:43.360 --> 06:47.200
but without getting into an argument about the perils of capitalism, we can agree that,

06:47.200 --> 06:52.960
personally speaking, Anderson is having a much better go of things. Yeah, I'd say so too. And

06:52.960 --> 06:56.400
it's not even because he cashed out, though cashing out was obviously the right thing to do,

06:57.200 --> 07:04.000
it's because Zuckerberg either didn't have a dream or a goal or a passion to begin with,

07:04.960 --> 07:09.520
or it was the wrong passion, it was like a one that served some kind of evil purpose,

07:09.520 --> 07:16.640
or he lost sight of it. In any case, Zuckerberg is now literally the alien that everyone thinks he

07:16.640 --> 07:22.720
is. But speaking of people not understanding the situation that they're in, someone vandalized

07:22.720 --> 07:32.320
Burnaby's rainbow crosswalk. Hold on, read the tagline here. Someone painted a green question

07:32.320 --> 07:39.120
mark and a cloud on Burnaby's first rainbow crosswalk overnight. The crosswalk was installed

07:39.120 --> 07:44.720
Thursday by the city of Burnaby in anticipation of Burnaby Pride event on Saturday. Now,

07:46.880 --> 07:51.280
I don't know if this is a cloud, guys. I don't know if you recognize the symbol here.

07:55.360 --> 07:59.760
While the crosswalk will be repaired in time for tomorrow's Pride Street party,

07:59.760 --> 08:04.960
McGowan said the vandalism is a good reminder of the work that still needs to be done to ensure

08:04.960 --> 08:11.680
the LGBTQ2S Plus community feels welcome and safe in Burnaby.

08:11.680 --> 08:19.440
Okay, this is an example of the internet leaking into real life,

08:20.480 --> 08:26.720
and I think this is not a slur. This is not like some kind of anti-gay individual spray painting

08:26.720 --> 08:32.640
something like an obvious anti-gay slogan or slur or image. This was a fucking meme,

08:33.200 --> 08:39.040
and you got memed on. But speaking of ridiculous things leaking over into reality, Millennial

08:39.040 --> 08:46.560
Couple bikes near ISIS territory thinking humans are kind and gets killed. Evil is a make believe

08:46.560 --> 08:51.920
concept we've invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans. An idealistic

08:51.920 --> 08:57.840
young American couple was killed in an Islamic State claimed terrorist attack last month while

08:57.840 --> 09:04.000
on a cycling trip around the world. I mean, obviously you have to be sad because people died,

09:04.800 --> 09:11.440
but there has to be some kind of Darwin Award situation involved in this, right? Like you can't

09:11.440 --> 09:16.720
simply think that all humans are the same, everyone's just fine, and that you can just go out

09:16.720 --> 09:22.080
into the world with like waving a flag of peace and then someone's not going to eventually come

09:22.080 --> 09:30.320
and kill you. It's a ridiculous notion. I mean, these two, as sad as it is, they were complete

09:30.320 --> 09:58.640
fucking idiots. And you know what? I actually agree with him there, you know?

10:01.280 --> 10:04.960
I am actually able to catch more of those things and it's quite nice.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.800
You read the papers and you're led to believe that the world is a big scary place.

10:08.800 --> 10:14.400
People, the narrative goes, are not to be trusted. People are bad, people are evil. I don't buy it.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.320
Evil is a make believe concept we've invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans

10:18.320 --> 10:23.120
holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own. By and large, humans

10:23.120 --> 10:28.160
are kind. Self-interested sometimes, myopic sometimes, but kind. Generous and wonderful

10:28.160 --> 10:35.600
and kind. That's all true. What is equally true is that sometimes humans will hold

10:35.600 --> 10:40.960
values and beliefs and perspectives that require them to kill you. You know, kill the Kefir

10:40.960 --> 10:47.520
wherever you find him. I'm sure there is obviously a good side to even the worst supporters of ISIS

10:47.520 --> 10:51.680
because that is just the nature of humanity. But the good side isn't what you need to be

10:51.680 --> 10:56.880
focused on. However, their dream trip came to a tragic and gruesome end when they got

10:56.880 --> 11:01.680
to Tajikistan, a weak state with a known terrorist threat that shares a border with

11:01.680 --> 11:06.800
Afghanistan, where ISIS and other terrorist groups are highly active. They were riding

11:06.800 --> 11:11.680
their bikes through the country on July 29th when a car rammed them, according to CBS News.

11:11.680 --> 11:17.280
Five men got out of the car and stabbed the couple to death along with two other cyclists,

11:17.280 --> 11:22.080
one from Switzerland and the other from the Netherlands. Two days later,

11:22.080 --> 11:27.120
ISIS released a video showing the same men sitting in front of the group's black flag.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.000
They looked at the camera and vowed to kill disbelievers.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.240
Some conservatives have framed the tragedy as a cautionary tale about not just the perils of

11:48.240 --> 11:55.120
travel but also naivete in general. I mean, traveling generally isn't that dangerous,

11:55.120 --> 11:59.440
of course it all depends on where you go, but yeah, being naive is very dangerous.

11:59.440 --> 12:05.200
Some liberals, for their part, view Austin and Gahaganan as simply unfortunate. Experts on the

12:05.200 --> 12:10.560
region told the Washington Post, Central Asia generally is fairly safe. Yeah, I don't fucking

12:10.560 --> 12:15.120
buy that for one second. But speaking of the radical left having a very disconnected view

12:15.120 --> 12:22.560
of reality, here's an article by Holly Brockwell of Gadjet. Men, women gamers are not trying to get

12:22.560 --> 12:27.600
in your pants, they just want to play. And she wrote this for Metro UK, presumably because her

12:27.600 --> 12:35.200
own outlet, Gadjet, is actually quite small right now. Now, I actually somewhat know Holly, she's

12:35.200 --> 12:40.800
a friend of a friend, and I've learned, I haven't really spoken to her, but I've learned a lot

12:40.800 --> 12:46.320
through this friend of a friend of what she's really like. And apparently she's actually not

12:46.320 --> 12:52.080
an insane leftist, she just virtue signals a whole bunch, and she's in fact made a career on virtue

12:52.080 --> 12:57.200
signaling. However, there have been some things where I would definitely have sided with her in

12:57.200 --> 13:03.520
the past, like, she had to fight the NHS a lot over in the UK in order to get sterilized because

13:03.520 --> 13:08.960
she doesn't want children, and I think that that is a travesty. Despite what you may think about

13:08.960 --> 13:13.760
whether or not people should be having kids, I think we can all agree that people should have

13:13.760 --> 13:19.200
the self-determination to control their life. And if she doesn't want kids, you may think that

13:19.200 --> 13:24.720
that's a mistake, but that's her right. She may come to regret it, but that's her responsibility,

13:24.720 --> 13:30.240
not anybody else's. She may not, she may know what she wants, and you know what? Once you're

13:30.240 --> 13:36.320
of age, once you're 18, that's that. You know, make your own decisions and take responsibility

13:36.320 --> 13:40.880
for those decisions. The government should not be stepping in to stop them. But that's just my

13:40.880 --> 13:47.360
rant on sterilization. Let's actually get to Holly's article here. This week, prominent games

13:47.360 --> 13:52.640
streamer Ninja stated that he won't game with women in case it causes problems in his marriage,

13:52.640 --> 13:57.680
and female gamers everywhere rolled their eyes. Now, I reported on this last week,

13:57.680 --> 14:02.160
if you remember. And I think what Holly's missing here is that it was never about

14:02.880 --> 14:08.560
the other women, it was about what his community would think regarding him streaming with other

14:08.560 --> 14:13.680
women. It was never about the woman. I mean, presumably he knows if he's going to cheat

14:13.680 --> 14:19.600
on his wife or not, right? And presumably the woman would know if she's interested in him,

14:19.600 --> 14:24.720
but it's not about them, it's about his community. He has a huge community, and internet communities

14:24.720 --> 14:29.360
of that size are likely to just, you know, slap couples together and start shipping them,

14:29.360 --> 14:32.560
whether or not it's actually true, and I think he just wanted to avoid that.

14:32.560 --> 14:37.760
It was about public perception, not women. To be fair to Ninja, he does seem to know this,

14:37.760 --> 14:44.240
but he's still wrong because his solution isn't to re-educate the men, it's to ban the women. One,

14:44.880 --> 14:54.720
Ninja has no obligation to tell his fans what to think. And two, Ninja has no obligation to

14:54.720 --> 14:59.520
have people on his stream that he doesn't want to have on his stream. And that's that. It's not

14:59.520 --> 15:05.360
that he's banning the women, it's that he's banning everyone he fucking likes. I said this

15:05.360 --> 15:10.400
last week, but just because he has a large platform does not mean that there's any kind

15:10.400 --> 15:15.200
of moral imperative to push your politics or your point of view on it. This is particularly

15:15.200 --> 15:20.000
disappointing because with his platform, Ninja is in a perfect position to make a real positive

15:20.000 --> 15:24.800
difference to the still depressingly sexist world of Twitch streaming. You know what?

15:25.840 --> 15:33.440
Maybe. But he is under no requirement to do so. He's there to stream games. He's not there to

15:33.440 --> 15:39.440
change the world. He's not there to do what you think is morally correct. Can you imagine if

15:39.440 --> 15:43.040
anyone came into your gaming group and was like, yo, you gotta add some women to this,

15:43.040 --> 15:47.120
regardless of the dynamics of the group, regardless of the skill of the women involved,

15:47.120 --> 15:51.760
regardless of any of these things that may actually destroy the gaming group,

15:51.760 --> 15:57.200
whether it's Fortnite or any other kind of game or like a tabletop situation or whatever,

15:57.200 --> 16:00.160
you just gotta add some women in there to make it 50-50 parity. You just have to.

16:01.280 --> 16:05.600
And then you're just like, fuck your group up. That would be ridiculous, right? But Ninja is

16:05.600 --> 16:10.560
the biggest Fortnite streamer in the world. He probably wants to have like a well polished team.

16:10.560 --> 16:15.840
And I'm sure there are very good female Fortnite players out there, but he probably hasn't

16:15.840 --> 16:23.120
encountered one that would outweigh the risks of having your entire community go apeshit on you.

16:23.120 --> 16:27.760
All right. I don't think this is Ninja's fault here. If anything, like if you wanted to put

16:27.760 --> 16:32.880
blame on somebody and I don't think anybody's to blame, but if you really wanted to blame somebody,

16:32.880 --> 16:38.160
I think it's his community's fault. And even then you can't go to his community and be like,

16:38.160 --> 16:41.920
re-educate yourself shitlords. Like it's not going to work like that. All right.

16:41.920 --> 16:47.600
He does what he wants. His community does what they want. And that's that. Holly, you can't just

16:48.400 --> 16:53.920
be people's moral nannies. I mean, you didn't want kids. So how come you're trying to mother

16:53.920 --> 16:58.160
these people? And of course there are some, some really trite things in this article,

16:58.160 --> 17:03.680
but in this case, it's pretty, it's pretty clear who can't see past the chromosomes. It's an Xbox,

17:03.680 --> 17:12.160
not an XY box for goodness sake. Well, you know what? You know what? It's a game boy,

17:12.720 --> 17:17.840
not a game girl. See, I can do it too. This is stupid. Let's move on.

17:17.840 --> 17:23.120
New Westminster terrorist attack as driver crashes into cyclists outside parliament.

17:23.120 --> 17:26.720
For some reason, my fucking ad blocker stopped working. I had ad block installed. It was right

17:26.720 --> 17:32.000
up here. Now it's just, it's just not there anymore. Oops. The police have confirmed they

17:32.000 --> 17:37.600
are treating the incident as a terrorist incident and the number of armed and unarmed police on the

17:37.600 --> 17:42.560
streets of central London will be increased. Okay. So I think we've all heard about this

17:42.560 --> 17:48.560
story before, right? There's some kind of truck of peace in the UK, ransom people over, maybe

17:48.560 --> 17:53.360
someone gets stabbed, maybe someone gets shot, you know, just, just daily life in London right now.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.960
And, and the police are treating it as a terrorist incident. That's how it should be,

17:56.960 --> 18:01.760
but that's not the story that I'm covering. I'm covering this story. Trump tweets on London

18:01.760 --> 18:08.560
terrorist attack as investigation gets underway. President Donald Trump on Tuesday again,

18:08.560 --> 18:14.080
seized on what he called a terrorist attack in London to call for tougher anti-terror measures.

18:14.640 --> 18:20.960
Even though the incident was still in the early stages of investigation, the police themselves

18:20.960 --> 18:26.800
called it a fucking terrorist attack. This is not something you can attack Trump for. I think it's

18:26.800 --> 18:32.800
really telling that CNN, rather than reporting on what happened in the terrorist attack,

18:32.800 --> 18:38.560
rather than at the very least confirming that it was a terrorist attack because the police said it

18:38.560 --> 18:43.600
was in fact being treated as a terrorist attack. This article was written and the article was

18:43.600 --> 18:49.520
about how wrong it was of Trump to tweet like it was a terrorist attack and how wrong it was

18:49.520 --> 18:55.360
for Trump to seize the opportunity and say, Oh, look at this latest terrorist attack in London.

18:55.360 --> 19:02.800
We need to increase security. Scoring ideological points against Trump is more important to CNN

19:02.800 --> 19:08.800
than reporting on a legit terrorist attack where people got killed. Don't forget that.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.960
This is what CNN is now.
