0	16260	We've had our hands on Bayonetta 3 for a little while now, and I think we can officially
16260	18020	say, this game is cursed.
18020	22620	It's had so many problems and controversies that have all overshadowed the game itself,
22620	24380	which to be honest is pretty mediocre.
24380	28700	But before we begin, I should give you a short primer on what Bayonetta actually is.
28700	32040	Bayonetta is a game where you play as Bayonetta, the Umbra Witch.
32040	37340	She made a deal with a demon, Madame Butterfly, to gain otherworldly powers, namely slow motion
37340	41480	magic, enchanted guns, and the ability to summon demons made out of her hair.
41480	45800	In fact, her entire suit is made up of her hair, and as you execute combos in the game,
45800	49840	Bayonetta uses her magical abilities, causing parts of her costume to come undone and attack
49840	50840	the enemies.
50840	53660	The better you are at the game, the more skin you see, and that's really all there is to
53660	54660	it.
54660	58300	Bayonetta feels like playing a flash of your Devil May Cry, with the added boob factor.
58300	62460	And back in 2009 when the first Bayonetta game was still new, this was basically the
62460	63580	view of it on the internet.
63580	68080	You can go back and watch the old Zero Punctuation review, or the short Game Grumps series where
68080	71680	they make fun of the ridiculous premise of the game, while still at least complimenting
71680	73000	it for its gameplay.
73000	77680	Meanwhile, Bayonetta fans on 4chan or Game Facts loved the game, not just for its sex
77680	82060	appeal, though they certainly loved that, but also for its high skill ceiling, replayability,
82060	83240	and quirky style.
83240	88240	Meanwhile online feminists, who did exist back in 2009, though far less in number and
88240	93660	nobody really cared about them, cried incessantly at how sexist or objectifying Bayonetta was.
93660	98620	Nowadays Bayonetta is considered a cult classic, but not a critical success, leading everyone
98620	103540	to believe that it would be one of those thousands of one and done games that littered the 2000s.
103540	107920	But to everyone's surprise, Bayonetta was revived in the Wii U in 2014 with Bayonetta
107920	108920	2!
108920	112060	Nintendo picked the franchise up and funded a sequel out of nowhere, making it Nintendo
112060	113360	exclusive in the process.
113360	116960	And to everyone's astonishment, it wasn't dumbed down just because it's Nintendo.
116960	122400	Bayonetta 2 remained just as sexual and over-the-top as Bayonetta 1, clearly a nod to the fans.
122400	126280	And the game played exactly the same way, same combos, same items.
126280	129960	Some of it felt a little bit cheap, like they just reused parts of Bayonetta 1, but at the
129960	132740	end of the day, it's more Bayonetta, and that's what everyone wanted.
132740	137320	With the massive success of the Nintendo Switch, people felt Bayonetta 3 would come along eventually.
137320	138320	And it did.
138320	140800	And my god, this game is far inferior.
140800	144980	The combos are drastically different enough that the game legitimately feels strange to
144980	145980	play.
145980	148260	They didn't add to what was there before, they changed everything.
148260	151340	Bayonetta moves differently, like the game feel is fundamentally different.
151340	154820	The weapons feel alien, and actually, the weapon choices are a fair bit shallower than
154820	156020	the first two games.
156020	159220	And then there's just a lot of stylistic choices that I don't really get why they
159220	160220	change.
160220	163780	For example, Bayonetta's sprint form is no longer a Black Panther, but instead Madam
163780	164880	Butterfly.
164880	167420	Change can be good, you don't want a series like this to get stagnant.
167420	171040	But this time around, the things that were changed were a part of what a lot of fans
171040	173460	viewed as Bayonetta's core identity.
173460	175040	Which brings us to the story.
175040	178320	Bayonetta 1 was a pretty straightforward plot, and yes, there's going to be spoilers for
178320	179320	all three games in this.
179320	183780	In the first game, Bayonetta travels to the fictional European city-state of Vigrid looking
183780	187920	for the fabled Eyes of the World, a duo of artifacts that when brought together grant
187920	189200	godlike powers.
189200	191680	Bayonetta's already got one eye, and she's after the other.
191680	195540	She's also an amnesiac, and it turns out that the child hanging around with her is actually
195540	200320	herself from the past, brought to the present by the last Lumen Sage, who are the mortal
200320	201860	enemies of the Umbra Witches.
201860	205820	In order to restore Bayonetta's memories, because he's actually her father and...okay,
205820	207840	maybe the story's a bit more complicated than I thought.
207840	211240	The point is, Bayonetta 2 continues this very same type of thing.
211240	215240	Sages and witches, fighting angels and demons, lots of gothic architecture and magic and
215240	216700	cool bullet-time fights.
216700	222380	The series has a very distinctive style, and Bayonetta 3 respected exactly 0% of it.
222380	226500	The story of Bayonetta 3 isn't connected to Bayonetta fighting her father, the last
226500	228460	Lumen Sage, like in Bayonetta 1.
228460	232220	Nor is it connected to Bayonetta fighting the god of Chaos, Acer, to whom the Eyes of
232220	234380	the World originally belonged, like in Bayonetta 2.
234380	239640	Bayonetta 3 is about how the world is actually made up of an infinite amount of timelines,
239640	244460	and how man-made bioweapons are rampaging across each timeline, destroying and consuming
244460	246500	them in order to become more powerful.
246500	250340	And each timeline has its own Bayonetta, and alternate-universe versions of the other characters
250340	253940	too, who have been repeatedly losing in the defense of their own worlds.
253940	257360	In other words, rather than a story about traveling to heaven and hell, we have a story
257360	259660	about time travel and alternate universes.
259660	263480	A newcomer to the cast is Viola, who looks to be straight out of Suicide Girls, and is
263480	268020	an Umbra Witch in training from an alternate dimension's future who, spoiler alert, is
268020	272060	the daughter of that dimension's Bayonetta and Luca, the comic relief dude from the first
272060	276180	two games, who time traveled back to our present after her parents died, she's literally
276180	277180	just Trunks.
277180	280540	Trunks' plotline is identical to Trunks, she's even got the sword, the jacket, she's
280540	281540	Trunks.
281540	285100	This is not necessarily a bad plot, Trunks' hero's journey is probably the most compelling
285100	289620	plotline in Dragon Ball, combining personal tragedy, loss of a mentor against an overwhelmingly
289620	293100	powerful evil, a young person who has potential but isn't really ready yet but they're
293100	297180	the best we've got, and a last-ditch desperate one-way trip to an unfamiliar past to try
297180	298320	and set things right.
298320	301700	The issue is, this is nothing like what Bayonetta is supposed to be.
301700	305820	Again, I'm not saying that change is always bad, but you're changing the foundations
305820	306900	of the lore here.
306900	311020	All the old lore and the conflicts aren't necessarily overwritten, they're just sidelined
311020	315460	so much because the developer wanted to tell some new story about human bioweapons and
315460	318380	alternate universes that wasn't even hinted at before.
318380	322480	Viola ends up being the second playable character of Bayonetta 3, and she's different enough
322480	323480	to warrant it.
323480	325380	Instead of a double jump, she has a grappling hook.
325380	328380	Instead of dodging to activate Witch Time, you have to parry with her sword, and her
328380	330780	combos are noticeably different from Bayonetta's.
330780	335040	Which makes me wonder why they had to make Bayonetta Control so drastically differently
335040	339180	from the first two games if they were already going to have a character who controls drastically
339180	340640	differently herself.
340640	345020	It's around the time of the first Viola level in the playthrough that I noticed Bayonetta
345020	348200	includes a skill tree, something that the first two games didn't have.
348200	351600	I guess that's probably where some of the complexity from the other in-game systems
351600	352600	went.
352600	355480	It's nothing too crazy, bog-standard stuff, but I came to a realization just looking over
355480	356480	the various upgrades.
356480	360440	Viola's skill tree is about three times as big as Bayonetta's.
360440	365040	In other words, you're expected to invest three times the EXP into Viola over Bayonetta.
365040	369800	They couldn't make you play as Viola, the new Pussy Riot Tumblr self-insert character,
369800	372760	more than Bayonetta in a game called Bayonetta, could they?
372760	374160	Well, they do.
374160	378320	And not only that, but, spoilers again for the ending, the Prime Universe's Bayonetta
378320	381780	dies and tells Viola she's the new Bayonetta.
381780	385160	The end of the game shows Viola just chilling with the other characters, like Bayonetta
385160	388120	would, implying that she's just going to be the hero now going forward.
388120	391880	This is yet another case of the new entry into a beloved property introducing a new
391880	396040	character that the author actually wants you to care about, and spends the entire thing
396040	400040	kicking aside everything you loved about the previous story in order to pump up the new
400040	401040	hero.
401040	404920	And yes, bad news, this is actually happening even in Japanese games now.
404920	410200	The western skinsuit rot has slowly but finally crept its way over to Japan, primarily through
410200	411480	the indie scene.
411480	415640	One symptom of it that isn't unique to Japanese games, but maybe a little bit more prominent
415640	420440	in them, is the amount of fourth-wall breaking, self-referential fluffing the games tend to
420440	421440	do.
421440	422440	Look at No More Heroes, for example.
422440	425400	The first No More Heroes, published around the same time as the first Bayonetta in fact,
425400	427040	only slightly broke the fourth wall.
427040	430860	It had subtlety, well, as much subtlety as a game can have when it's all about chopping
430860	435100	off Mafioso's heads with a lightsaber and watching a geyser of blood and gold coins
435100	436100	erupt out.
436100	440160	What I mean is, when it got referential, it was quiet, quick, and the developer didn't
440160	441780	care if you missed it.
441780	444760	Compare that to the latest game, No More Heroes 3, published about a year ago.
444760	447100	It has all the same problems as Bayonetta 3.
447100	450720	It feels too different, it looks too different, it controls too different, the styles change
450720	454360	too much, and the developer, rather being subtle, would rather whack you over the head
454360	458080	with all the cutaways to arcade-looking mini-games, or how some of the story is told in a visual
458080	462280	style of a drastically different game, or how, yeah, we're even spoiling No More Heroes
462280	466520	this time, the final boss is literally a Super Smash Bros. match.
466520	470560	This whole, let's remove the gameplay loop that you love and replace it with an old arcade
470560	475020	game thing is even in Bayonetta 3, where the story is periodically interrupted to cut
475020	478840	away to John doing some sort of platformer stealth thing that you might have seen in
478840	479840	the 1980s.
479840	480920	Why do we gotta do this?
480920	482860	I bought Bayonetta to play Bayonetta.
482860	486760	I bought No More Heroes to play No More Heroes, not to have the developer wank off all over
486760	487760	me.
487760	491120	So we're like halfway into this Indefensible video, and I haven't even talked about the
491120	493560	actual controversy surrounding Bayonetta 3.
493560	497280	Yeah, this isn't strictly a game review channel, as much as I love doing let's plays and streams
497280	498480	and reviewing games.
498480	501680	This wouldn't be an Indefensible if there wasn't another angle to talk about.
501680	506040	And that other angle, the controversy surrounding this game, went viral so much, I bet that
506040	509920	most of you who didn't play the game only knew about those controversies.
509920	512480	You probably haven't even heard the game is actually shit yet.
512480	515640	Let's go in order from the least to most hilarious.
515640	517440	First, Naive Angel Mode.
517440	520780	Remember when I said earlier that Bayonetta is known for its sex appeal, with Bayonetta
520780	523520	stripping in order to use her clothing as a component of her magic?
523760	528160	Well, in case you didn't like tits for some reason, you can now turn on Naive Angel Mode,
528160	531120	which completely censors the sexual content right out of the game.
531120	533440	No more Madame Butterfly's ass hanging out, none of it.
533440	538140	I mean, it's kinda cucked, sure, but at least they didn't just censor the whole game entirely
538140	540040	and make everyone play without the sexy stuff.
540040	541600	I just don't see the point of it, though.
541600	545600	The style of Bayonetta is over-the-top ridiculous sexuality.
545600	548040	Without that, you really just kinda have a mediocre beat-em-up.
548040	552400	I will never not find it funny that in 2007 when Mass Effect came out, and you could see
552400	557320	a lesbian blue alien booty, it was rightoids on Fox News screaming about how the degeneracy
557320	562460	in video games was destroying children's minds, while in 2022 it's the leftoids who are talking
562460	565720	about how progressive and pro-women it is that you can turn off the witch booties in
565720	566720	Bayonetta now.
566720	569760	Oh, by the way, they're still angry because they didn't censor it enough, though.
569760	573840	Also, I haven't tried out Naive Angel Mode myself because I'm not a cuck, but some people
573840	578240	online claim that it actually makes the game easier, and the game's already pretty easy.
578240	582240	This is a literal Game Journal mode for the Patrick Klepics of the world, who think that
582240	584360	they'll go blind if they look at a naked woman.
584360	585600	Second, Helena Taylor.
585600	588280	Oh boy, y'all saw this go viral, didn't you?
588280	592160	Helena Taylor was the voice actress of Bayonetta through all of her appearances in the main
592160	595400	games, as well as other side appearances, until Bayonetta 3.
595400	596400	Why not Bayonetta 3?
596400	598320	Well, hear it from the woman herself.
598320	605280	Bayonetta franchise made an approximated $450 million.
605280	609680	That's not including merchandise.
609680	614700	As an actor, I trained for a total of seven and a half years.
614700	619720	Three years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, Lambda, with voice coach
619720	628080	Barbara Barkery, and four and a half years with the legendary Larry Moss in Los Angeles.
628080	632600	And what did they think this was worth?
632600	635880	What did they offer to pay me?
635880	645640	The final offer to do the whole game as a buyout, a flat rate, was $4,000.
645640	651120	In case you don't know, $4,000 is a remarkably low fee for a game with this much voice acting
651120	652920	and this much anticipation behind it.
652920	656880	Bayonetta might have begun as a cult classic, but after Nintendo revived the IP and pumped
656880	662040	a bunch of money into it, it legitimately became a mainstream, more popular franchise.
662040	665360	For the amount of work that Taylor would be expected to do, and the amount of money the
665360	669760	game was projected to make, $4,000 was indeed a rip-off, and because she claimed that her
669760	696400	bosses wouldn't negotiate, she called upon Bayonetta fans to boycott
726400	753040	the game.
753040	756800	Alright, I guess it's Nintendo's fault that London has stuffed the broom with immigrants,
756800	759520	but it turns out this was all fake.
759520	764520	Jason Schreier, doing the first real reporting of his Game Journo life, got a hold of documentation
764520	768960	from Platinum Games showing that Taylor was offered $4,000 per recording session for at
768960	772560	least five sessions, rounding out to at least $20,000.
772560	777160	In response, Taylor asked for a six-figure paycheck and residuals from the game's sales,
777160	778440	which Platinum rejected.
778440	783920	Taylor later changed her public story, saying she was actually offered $10,000, not $4,000,
783920	787680	and when she emailed Hideki Kamiya for help, the game's director and notorious Twitter
787680	792080	troll, he offered her personally an additional $5,000, which she rejected.
792080	796640	Whichever of these two stories is true, it's not the $4,000 from that viral clip, which
796640	801400	quickly shot up to 9.5 million views, and caused a lot of deranged, left-leaning fans
801400	806160	to attack Platinum Games and the new Bayonetta voice actress, Jennifer Hale, for being capitalist
806160	807820	excel-outs and money-grubbers.
808200	812100	In response to this new information, Taylor put out a list of charities she thought deserves
812100	814660	your money more than Nintendo and Platinum Games.
814660	818380	A closer inspection of the list revealed, however, that one of the charities was an
818380	823460	anti-abortion group, and in real time, we watched the Game Journo narrative change from
823460	827380	support this oppressed member of the proletariat, this passionate creative who just wants to
827380	832460	get paid what she's owed by her exploitative capitalist boss, to string this bitch up for
832460	835680	holding, whatever you might think of it, a relatively common political stance.
835720	840500	It's a wonder to behold that these leftoids were completely fine with her blatantly lying
840500	841720	about her contract.
841720	844400	All of that is forgiven because fuck the corpos.
844400	845400	But now she's pro-life?
845400	847440	Oh, that's too far.
847440	848680	Third and final.
848680	852160	I bet you're wondering, Dev, how do you know these people are all leftoids?
852160	856160	You don't necessarily need to be a leftist to think someone's getting paid poorly and
856160	858080	want to see their conditions improve.
858080	862000	It might not be the case that Viola is wearing the progressive skin suit of the Bayonetta
862000	863000	franchise.
863000	866580	Being sexual content is dumb, but not exclusively leftist.
866580	868640	Why am I making this conversation political?
868640	869920	Well, here's why.
869920	875360	The story of Bayonetta 3 has confirmed, spoilers, in canon, that Bayonetta is straight through
875360	879940	her many, many relationships with Luca across all the different universes.
879940	883940	And for some reason, at the same time as the Helena Taylor shit was kicking off, the entire
883940	889720	plot of the game was leaked to Twitter, causing LGBT Twitter to go into full meltdown mode.
889720	901680	It's not misandry-speaking when I say Bayonetta should be a lesbian.
901680	904800	I could never, in good conscience, unleash on a normal-ass man.
904800	907880	Luca was getting strapped to literal rockets in Bayonetta 1.
907880	910100	That poor soul does not stand a chance.
910100	914840	To be fair, there is a recurring theme in specifically lesbian-oriented storytelling,
914840	918640	where the women characters are sexy and powerful and competent, and the men are attracted to
918640	922840	them but are stupid and doofy and can't actually keep up, and the woman eventually
922840	927200	falls for another woman because the incompetent men around her can't match her energy.
927200	931680	These people were hoping that this was Bayonetta's dynamic with Luca, because Bayonetta is sexy
931680	935660	and powerful and competent, Luca is the comic relief, and Bayonetta is often paired with
935660	938740	John, another sexy and powerful and competent woman.
938740	943480	And Bayonetta literally goes to hell to save her in the second game, so yeah, fair enough.
943480	945520	The tropes of lesbian fiction are all here.
945520	948360	I will say, though, this isn't Nintendo committing a crime against the gays.
948360	949680	It's just a video game.
949680	954200	What really kicked this off, though, was some they-them game journal over at Paste magazine,
954200	957820	which is both the name of her workplace and the lunch she brought in, who said,
957820	959320	Do straight guys love this?
959320	960920	I truly find it hard to believe.
960920	961920	I'm sorry.
961920	962920	I just don't believe it.
962920	964600	I don't believe straight men are into this sexually.
964600	965600	What do you mean?
965600	969240	You can't believe straight guys are into amazingly hot women whose tits and ass are hanging out
969240	971760	and who runs around in skin-tight black clothing?
971760	973080	What exactly are you missing here?
973080	974680	Who is the gazer in Bayonetta?
974680	976240	I genuinely have no idea.
976240	980160	I don't know who looks at a woman's body in the way the camera observes Bayonetta other
980160	981160	than queer people.
981160	984640	There's a huge reason why the game attracted a big queer audience.
984640	989200	I think thinking about it in terms of story is not exactly describing what queer players
989200	990480	are picking up about Bayonetta.
990480	992400	It's got very gay vibes.
992400	994800	It shoots for objectification and lands on camp.
994800	999740	The best part of this argument is that radfems like Anita Sarkeesian back in 2014 were saying
999740	1001880	the exact opposite of this shit.
1001880	1006800	That Bayonetta's design, mechanics, and characterization is created specifically for the sexual pleasure
1006800	1008800	of straight male gamers.
1008800	1012760	And now we've got people crying that Bayonetta is confirmed straight in canon.
1012760	1016560	Seeing the Bayonetta discourse go from this is the gross male gaze, women would never
1016560	1021560	like this, to men would never like Bayonetta, she's empowering to women, is fucking wild.
1021560	1024760	If there's anything that tells me that the concept of the male gaze is bullshit, at least
1024760	1030280	how these people view it, it's watching literally the exact same images morphed from disgusting
1030280	1035040	male-centric fetishization to empowering lesbian-centric queerness right before my
1035040	1036040	eyes.
1036040	1040120	The problem with that tropes of lesbian fiction view of the topic, though, isn't just that
1040120	1044600	the whole thing collapses into copium when the creator says she's straight, actually.
1044600	1049600	It's that in their copium is the idea that Bayonetta cannot be strong, sexy, or competent
1049600	1051040	if she's in love with a man.
1051040	1055640	And that is the angle that Polygon editor and lobotomy patient Mattie Myers took.
1055640	1058900	This is a long stupid article, like all the nonsense these people put out, but the central
1058900	1062420	thesis is this, making Bayonetta straight undermines her character.
1062420	1065340	Myers doesn't like the man she ended up with, or that she ended up with a man at all.
1065340	1069260	And after Myers got clapped back for this take, she posted online that of course the
1069260	1073500	game was doing well, it was the straight men who were buying it and rating it online.
1073500	1075820	The game was made explicitly for them.
1075820	1078020	There's a lot of problems with this logic, let's run them all down.
1078020	1081340	One, Bayonetta being confirmed as straight doesn't happen until the end of the game.
1081340	1084920	And when you put this tweet out, it wasn't really widespread knowledge yet, people were
1084920	1086080	still playing through it.
1086080	1089680	If Bayonetta being confirmed straight would lead to a bump, it wouldn't have happened
1089680	1090680	yet.
1090680	1094640	Two, Bayonetta always got consistently high scores from fans, and even though I don't
1094640	1098260	like Bayonetta 3 personally, I can accept the idea that they might all get relatively
1098260	1099260	similar scores.
1099260	1104280	Three, Mattie, your view of Bayonetta 1 and 2 was that it had an obvious queerness to
1104280	1107520	it, so much so that Bayonetta 3 has disappointed you.
1107520	1111420	From your point of view, if Bayonetta 3 is only getting high scores because it's made
1111420	1117020	for men, why did Bayonetta 1 and 2 get similarly high scores if it was made for the queers
1117020	1118200	as you see it?
1118200	1122780	And four, I don't believe that Mattie Meyers, or any other game journalist, or any of these
1122780	1126520	fucking crying twitter plebs are actually fans of Bayonetta.
1126520	1127740	You wanna know why?
1127740	1131840	Because Bayonetta says she's straight, or at least into men and therefore bi in the
1131840	1141340	first fucking game.
1141380	1145460	Here is what actually happened in the minds of all of these sexuality-questioning millennial
1145460	1150180	teens who grew up to be obnoxious identity politics riddled officers of the Twitterati.
1150180	1154940	You saw a strong, sexy, competent woman in Bayonetta, who existed in a game with an over-the-top
1154940	1156980	style that is, yeah, pretty campy.
1156980	1162020	You saw that she had a strong, sexy, competent foil in John, who is just as flamboyant and
1162020	1165700	dominatrix-like as her, and you imagined them together.
1165700	1168200	Maybe you even got off to fan porn of it or something.
1168200	1174040	And because you are your own toxic stereotype of the LGBTQ community, whatever the fuck
1174040	1179380	that is, you instantly think that a strong, sexy, competent woman who wears fetish clothing
1179380	1182760	and has a dominant personality has to be gay.
1182760	1187940	But she doesn't, because no matter how many family-friendly drag shows you popularize,
1187940	1192960	or outdoor BDSM displays go marching down the street on Pride Month, being gay does
1192960	1197720	not actually require you to be a walking display of gaudy sexuality.
1197760	1202600	Saying that Bayonetta has to be a lesbian, look how hypersexual she is, is a more toxic
1202600	1207840	attitude towards lesbians than anything I've ever heard a conservative say in over 20 years
1207840	1208840	now.
1208840	1211800	Those guys, worst case scenario, they'll call you a dyke and move on.
1211800	1215440	They're not going to demand you start drinking your partner's piss in public or you're
1215440	1216560	not actually gay.
1216560	1220700	All of this insanity surrounding Bayonetta 3 is what the game is now known for.
1220700	1223600	The voice actor stuff, the gay stuff, no one actually talks about the quality of the game
1223600	1224600	itself.
1224600	1226960	And that's probably for the best, because it is mediocre and disappointing.
1226960	1228560	I don't care that Bayonetta is straight.
1228560	1231380	Frankly, the story actually does make more sense for her to be with John.
1231380	1233300	They do have two games of history together.
1233300	1238200	The problem is that Bayonetta 3 fully disregards those two games of history in many ways, not
1238200	1240080	just with her relationship with John.
1240080	1242520	All this online nonsense surrounding the release was pretty fun.
1242520	1245720	But once you get past all that, you have a game that frankly, I wouldn't recommend
1245720	1248200	picking up unless you were a hardcore Bayonetta fan.
1248200	1249440	And if you are, you've already got it.
