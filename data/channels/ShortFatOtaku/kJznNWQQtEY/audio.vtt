00:00.000 --> 00:16.260
We've had our hands on Bayonetta 3 for a little while now, and I think we can officially

00:16.260 --> 00:18.020
say, this game is cursed.

00:18.020 --> 00:22.620
It's had so many problems and controversies that have all overshadowed the game itself,

00:22.620 --> 00:24.380
which to be honest is pretty mediocre.

00:24.380 --> 00:28.700
But before we begin, I should give you a short primer on what Bayonetta actually is.

00:28.700 --> 00:32.040
Bayonetta is a game where you play as Bayonetta, the Umbra Witch.

00:32.040 --> 00:37.340
She made a deal with a demon, Madame Butterfly, to gain otherworldly powers, namely slow motion

00:37.340 --> 00:41.480
magic, enchanted guns, and the ability to summon demons made out of her hair.

00:41.480 --> 00:45.800
In fact, her entire suit is made up of her hair, and as you execute combos in the game,

00:45.800 --> 00:49.840
Bayonetta uses her magical abilities, causing parts of her costume to come undone and attack

00:49.840 --> 00:50.840
the enemies.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.660
The better you are at the game, the more skin you see, and that's really all there is to

00:53.660 --> 00:54.660
it.

00:54.660 --> 00:58.300
Bayonetta feels like playing a flash of your Devil May Cry, with the added boob factor.

00:58.300 --> 01:02.460
And back in 2009 when the first Bayonetta game was still new, this was basically the

01:02.460 --> 01:03.580
view of it on the internet.

01:03.580 --> 01:08.080
You can go back and watch the old Zero Punctuation review, or the short Game Grumps series where

01:08.080 --> 01:11.680
they make fun of the ridiculous premise of the game, while still at least complimenting

01:11.680 --> 01:13.000
it for its gameplay.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.680
Meanwhile, Bayonetta fans on 4chan or Game Facts loved the game, not just for its sex

01:17.680 --> 01:22.060
appeal, though they certainly loved that, but also for its high skill ceiling, replayability,

01:22.060 --> 01:23.240
and quirky style.

01:23.240 --> 01:28.240
Meanwhile online feminists, who did exist back in 2009, though far less in number and

01:28.240 --> 01:33.660
nobody really cared about them, cried incessantly at how sexist or objectifying Bayonetta was.

01:33.660 --> 01:38.620
Nowadays Bayonetta is considered a cult classic, but not a critical success, leading everyone

01:38.620 --> 01:43.540
to believe that it would be one of those thousands of one and done games that littered the 2000s.

01:43.540 --> 01:47.920
But to everyone's surprise, Bayonetta was revived in the Wii U in 2014 with Bayonetta

01:47.920 --> 01:48.920
2!

01:48.920 --> 01:52.060
Nintendo picked the franchise up and funded a sequel out of nowhere, making it Nintendo

01:52.060 --> 01:53.360
exclusive in the process.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.960
And to everyone's astonishment, it wasn't dumbed down just because it's Nintendo.

01:56.960 --> 02:02.400
Bayonetta 2 remained just as sexual and over-the-top as Bayonetta 1, clearly a nod to the fans.

02:02.400 --> 02:06.280
And the game played exactly the same way, same combos, same items.

02:06.280 --> 02:09.960
Some of it felt a little bit cheap, like they just reused parts of Bayonetta 1, but at the

02:09.960 --> 02:12.740
end of the day, it's more Bayonetta, and that's what everyone wanted.

02:12.740 --> 02:17.320
With the massive success of the Nintendo Switch, people felt Bayonetta 3 would come along eventually.

02:17.320 --> 02:18.320
And it did.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.800
And my god, this game is far inferior.

02:20.800 --> 02:24.980
The combos are drastically different enough that the game legitimately feels strange to

02:24.980 --> 02:25.980
play.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.260
They didn't add to what was there before, they changed everything.

02:28.260 --> 02:31.340
Bayonetta moves differently, like the game feel is fundamentally different.

02:31.340 --> 02:34.820
The weapons feel alien, and actually, the weapon choices are a fair bit shallower than

02:34.820 --> 02:36.020
the first two games.

02:36.020 --> 02:39.220
And then there's just a lot of stylistic choices that I don't really get why they

02:39.220 --> 02:40.220
change.

02:40.220 --> 02:43.780
For example, Bayonetta's sprint form is no longer a Black Panther, but instead Madam

02:43.780 --> 02:44.880
Butterfly.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.420
Change can be good, you don't want a series like this to get stagnant.

02:47.420 --> 02:51.040
But this time around, the things that were changed were a part of what a lot of fans

02:51.040 --> 02:53.460
viewed as Bayonetta's core identity.

02:53.460 --> 02:55.040
Which brings us to the story.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.320
Bayonetta 1 was a pretty straightforward plot, and yes, there's going to be spoilers for

02:58.320 --> 02:59.320
all three games in this.

02:59.320 --> 03:03.780
In the first game, Bayonetta travels to the fictional European city-state of Vigrid looking

03:03.780 --> 03:07.920
for the fabled Eyes of the World, a duo of artifacts that when brought together grant

03:07.920 --> 03:09.200
godlike powers.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.680
Bayonetta's already got one eye, and she's after the other.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.540
She's also an amnesiac, and it turns out that the child hanging around with her is actually

03:15.540 --> 03:20.320
herself from the past, brought to the present by the last Lumen Sage, who are the mortal

03:20.320 --> 03:21.860
enemies of the Umbra Witches.

03:21.860 --> 03:25.820
In order to restore Bayonetta's memories, because he's actually her father and...okay,

03:25.820 --> 03:27.840
maybe the story's a bit more complicated than I thought.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.240
The point is, Bayonetta 2 continues this very same type of thing.

03:31.240 --> 03:35.240
Sages and witches, fighting angels and demons, lots of gothic architecture and magic and

03:35.240 --> 03:36.700
cool bullet-time fights.

03:36.700 --> 03:42.380
The series has a very distinctive style, and Bayonetta 3 respected exactly 0% of it.

03:42.380 --> 03:46.500
The story of Bayonetta 3 isn't connected to Bayonetta fighting her father, the last

03:46.500 --> 03:48.460
Lumen Sage, like in Bayonetta 1.

03:48.460 --> 03:52.220
Nor is it connected to Bayonetta fighting the god of Chaos, Acer, to whom the Eyes of

03:52.220 --> 03:54.380
the World originally belonged, like in Bayonetta 2.

03:54.380 --> 03:59.640
Bayonetta 3 is about how the world is actually made up of an infinite amount of timelines,

03:59.640 --> 04:04.460
and how man-made bioweapons are rampaging across each timeline, destroying and consuming

04:04.460 --> 04:06.500
them in order to become more powerful.

04:06.500 --> 04:10.340
And each timeline has its own Bayonetta, and alternate-universe versions of the other characters

04:10.340 --> 04:13.940
too, who have been repeatedly losing in the defense of their own worlds.

04:13.940 --> 04:17.360
In other words, rather than a story about traveling to heaven and hell, we have a story

04:17.360 --> 04:19.660
about time travel and alternate universes.

04:19.660 --> 04:23.480
A newcomer to the cast is Viola, who looks to be straight out of Suicide Girls, and is

04:23.480 --> 04:28.020
an Umbra Witch in training from an alternate dimension's future who, spoiler alert, is

04:28.020 --> 04:32.060
the daughter of that dimension's Bayonetta and Luca, the comic relief dude from the first

04:32.060 --> 04:36.180
two games, who time traveled back to our present after her parents died, she's literally

04:36.180 --> 04:37.180
just Trunks.

04:37.180 --> 04:40.540
Trunks' plotline is identical to Trunks, she's even got the sword, the jacket, she's

04:40.540 --> 04:41.540
Trunks.

04:41.540 --> 04:45.100
This is not necessarily a bad plot, Trunks' hero's journey is probably the most compelling

04:45.100 --> 04:49.620
plotline in Dragon Ball, combining personal tragedy, loss of a mentor against an overwhelmingly

04:49.620 --> 04:53.100
powerful evil, a young person who has potential but isn't really ready yet but they're

04:53.100 --> 04:57.180
the best we've got, and a last-ditch desperate one-way trip to an unfamiliar past to try

04:57.180 --> 04:58.320
and set things right.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.700
The issue is, this is nothing like what Bayonetta is supposed to be.

05:01.700 --> 05:05.820
Again, I'm not saying that change is always bad, but you're changing the foundations

05:05.820 --> 05:06.900
of the lore here.

05:06.900 --> 05:11.020
All the old lore and the conflicts aren't necessarily overwritten, they're just sidelined

05:11.020 --> 05:15.460
so much because the developer wanted to tell some new story about human bioweapons and

05:15.460 --> 05:18.380
alternate universes that wasn't even hinted at before.

05:18.380 --> 05:22.480
Viola ends up being the second playable character of Bayonetta 3, and she's different enough

05:22.480 --> 05:23.480
to warrant it.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.380
Instead of a double jump, she has a grappling hook.

05:25.380 --> 05:28.380
Instead of dodging to activate Witch Time, you have to parry with her sword, and her

05:28.380 --> 05:30.780
combos are noticeably different from Bayonetta's.

05:30.780 --> 05:35.040
Which makes me wonder why they had to make Bayonetta Control so drastically differently

05:35.040 --> 05:39.180
from the first two games if they were already going to have a character who controls drastically

05:39.180 --> 05:40.640
differently herself.

05:40.640 --> 05:45.020
It's around the time of the first Viola level in the playthrough that I noticed Bayonetta

05:45.020 --> 05:48.200
includes a skill tree, something that the first two games didn't have.

05:48.200 --> 05:51.600
I guess that's probably where some of the complexity from the other in-game systems

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
went.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.480
It's nothing too crazy, bog-standard stuff, but I came to a realization just looking over

05:55.480 --> 05:56.480
the various upgrades.

05:56.480 --> 06:00.440
Viola's skill tree is about three times as big as Bayonetta's.

06:00.440 --> 06:05.040
In other words, you're expected to invest three times the EXP into Viola over Bayonetta.

06:05.040 --> 06:09.800
They couldn't make you play as Viola, the new Pussy Riot Tumblr self-insert character,

06:09.800 --> 06:12.760
more than Bayonetta in a game called Bayonetta, could they?

06:12.760 --> 06:14.160
Well, they do.

06:14.160 --> 06:18.320
And not only that, but, spoilers again for the ending, the Prime Universe's Bayonetta

06:18.320 --> 06:21.780
dies and tells Viola she's the new Bayonetta.

06:21.780 --> 06:25.160
The end of the game shows Viola just chilling with the other characters, like Bayonetta

06:25.160 --> 06:28.120
would, implying that she's just going to be the hero now going forward.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.880
This is yet another case of the new entry into a beloved property introducing a new

06:31.880 --> 06:36.040
character that the author actually wants you to care about, and spends the entire thing

06:36.040 --> 06:40.040
kicking aside everything you loved about the previous story in order to pump up the new

06:40.040 --> 06:41.040
hero.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.920
And yes, bad news, this is actually happening even in Japanese games now.

06:44.920 --> 06:50.200
The western skinsuit rot has slowly but finally crept its way over to Japan, primarily through

06:50.200 --> 06:51.480
the indie scene.

06:51.480 --> 06:55.640
One symptom of it that isn't unique to Japanese games, but maybe a little bit more prominent

06:55.640 --> 07:00.440
in them, is the amount of fourth-wall breaking, self-referential fluffing the games tend to

07:00.440 --> 07:01.440
do.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.440
Look at No More Heroes, for example.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.400
The first No More Heroes, published around the same time as the first Bayonetta in fact,

07:05.400 --> 07:07.040
only slightly broke the fourth wall.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.860
It had subtlety, well, as much subtlety as a game can have when it's all about chopping

07:10.860 --> 07:15.100
off Mafioso's heads with a lightsaber and watching a geyser of blood and gold coins

07:15.100 --> 07:16.100
erupt out.

07:16.100 --> 07:20.160
What I mean is, when it got referential, it was quiet, quick, and the developer didn't

07:20.160 --> 07:21.780
care if you missed it.

07:21.780 --> 07:24.760
Compare that to the latest game, No More Heroes 3, published about a year ago.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.100
It has all the same problems as Bayonetta 3.

07:27.100 --> 07:30.720
It feels too different, it looks too different, it controls too different, the styles change

07:30.720 --> 07:34.360
too much, and the developer, rather being subtle, would rather whack you over the head

07:34.360 --> 07:38.080
with all the cutaways to arcade-looking mini-games, or how some of the story is told in a visual

07:38.080 --> 07:42.280
style of a drastically different game, or how, yeah, we're even spoiling No More Heroes

07:42.280 --> 07:46.520
this time, the final boss is literally a Super Smash Bros. match.

07:46.520 --> 07:50.560
This whole, let's remove the gameplay loop that you love and replace it with an old arcade

07:50.560 --> 07:55.020
game thing is even in Bayonetta 3, where the story is periodically interrupted to cut

07:55.020 --> 07:58.840
away to John doing some sort of platformer stealth thing that you might have seen in

07:58.840 --> 07:59.840
the 1980s.

07:59.840 --> 08:00.920
Why do we gotta do this?

08:00.920 --> 08:02.860
I bought Bayonetta to play Bayonetta.

08:02.860 --> 08:06.760
I bought No More Heroes to play No More Heroes, not to have the developer wank off all over

08:06.760 --> 08:07.760
me.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.120
So we're like halfway into this Indefensible video, and I haven't even talked about the

08:11.120 --> 08:13.560
actual controversy surrounding Bayonetta 3.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.280
Yeah, this isn't strictly a game review channel, as much as I love doing let's plays and streams

08:17.280 --> 08:18.480
and reviewing games.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.680
This wouldn't be an Indefensible if there wasn't another angle to talk about.

08:21.680 --> 08:26.040
And that other angle, the controversy surrounding this game, went viral so much, I bet that

08:26.040 --> 08:29.920
most of you who didn't play the game only knew about those controversies.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.480
You probably haven't even heard the game is actually shit yet.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.640
Let's go in order from the least to most hilarious.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.440
First, Naive Angel Mode.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.780
Remember when I said earlier that Bayonetta is known for its sex appeal, with Bayonetta

08:40.780 --> 08:43.520
stripping in order to use her clothing as a component of her magic?

08:43.760 --> 08:48.160
Well, in case you didn't like tits for some reason, you can now turn on Naive Angel Mode,

08:48.160 --> 08:51.120
which completely censors the sexual content right out of the game.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.440
No more Madame Butterfly's ass hanging out, none of it.

08:53.440 --> 08:58.140
I mean, it's kinda cucked, sure, but at least they didn't just censor the whole game entirely

08:58.140 --> 09:00.040
and make everyone play without the sexy stuff.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.600
I just don't see the point of it, though.

09:01.600 --> 09:05.600
The style of Bayonetta is over-the-top ridiculous sexuality.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.040
Without that, you really just kinda have a mediocre beat-em-up.

09:08.040 --> 09:12.400
I will never not find it funny that in 2007 when Mass Effect came out, and you could see

09:12.400 --> 09:17.320
a lesbian blue alien booty, it was rightoids on Fox News screaming about how the degeneracy

09:17.320 --> 09:22.460
in video games was destroying children's minds, while in 2022 it's the leftoids who are talking

09:22.460 --> 09:25.720
about how progressive and pro-women it is that you can turn off the witch booties in

09:25.720 --> 09:26.720
Bayonetta now.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.760
Oh, by the way, they're still angry because they didn't censor it enough, though.

09:29.760 --> 09:33.840
Also, I haven't tried out Naive Angel Mode myself because I'm not a cuck, but some people

09:33.840 --> 09:38.240
online claim that it actually makes the game easier, and the game's already pretty easy.

09:38.240 --> 09:42.240
This is a literal Game Journal mode for the Patrick Klepics of the world, who think that

09:42.240 --> 09:44.360
they'll go blind if they look at a naked woman.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.600
Second, Helena Taylor.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.280
Oh boy, y'all saw this go viral, didn't you?

09:48.280 --> 09:52.160
Helena Taylor was the voice actress of Bayonetta through all of her appearances in the main

09:52.160 --> 09:55.400
games, as well as other side appearances, until Bayonetta 3.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.400
Why not Bayonetta 3?

09:56.400 --> 09:58.320
Well, hear it from the woman herself.

09:58.320 --> 10:05.280
Bayonetta franchise made an approximated $450 million.

10:05.280 --> 10:09.680
That's not including merchandise.

10:09.680 --> 10:14.700
As an actor, I trained for a total of seven and a half years.

10:14.700 --> 10:19.720
Three years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, Lambda, with voice coach

10:19.720 --> 10:28.080
Barbara Barkery, and four and a half years with the legendary Larry Moss in Los Angeles.

10:28.080 --> 10:32.600
And what did they think this was worth?

10:32.600 --> 10:35.880
What did they offer to pay me?

10:35.880 --> 10:45.640
The final offer to do the whole game as a buyout, a flat rate, was $4,000.

10:45.640 --> 10:51.120
In case you don't know, $4,000 is a remarkably low fee for a game with this much voice acting

10:51.120 --> 10:52.920
and this much anticipation behind it.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.880
Bayonetta might have begun as a cult classic, but after Nintendo revived the IP and pumped

10:56.880 --> 11:02.040
a bunch of money into it, it legitimately became a mainstream, more popular franchise.

11:02.040 --> 11:05.360
For the amount of work that Taylor would be expected to do, and the amount of money the

11:05.360 --> 11:09.760
game was projected to make, $4,000 was indeed a rip-off, and because she claimed that her

11:09.760 --> 11:36.400
bosses wouldn't negotiate, she called upon Bayonetta fans to boycott

12:06.400 --> 12:33.040
the game.

12:33.040 --> 12:36.800
Alright, I guess it's Nintendo's fault that London has stuffed the broom with immigrants,

12:36.800 --> 12:39.520
but it turns out this was all fake.

12:39.520 --> 12:44.520
Jason Schreier, doing the first real reporting of his Game Journo life, got a hold of documentation

12:44.520 --> 12:48.960
from Platinum Games showing that Taylor was offered $4,000 per recording session for at

12:48.960 --> 12:52.560
least five sessions, rounding out to at least $20,000.

12:52.560 --> 12:57.160
In response, Taylor asked for a six-figure paycheck and residuals from the game's sales,

12:57.160 --> 12:58.440
which Platinum rejected.

12:58.440 --> 13:03.920
Taylor later changed her public story, saying she was actually offered $10,000, not $4,000,

13:03.920 --> 13:07.680
and when she emailed Hideki Kamiya for help, the game's director and notorious Twitter

13:07.680 --> 13:12.080
troll, he offered her personally an additional $5,000, which she rejected.

13:12.080 --> 13:16.640
Whichever of these two stories is true, it's not the $4,000 from that viral clip, which

13:16.640 --> 13:21.400
quickly shot up to 9.5 million views, and caused a lot of deranged, left-leaning fans

13:21.400 --> 13:26.160
to attack Platinum Games and the new Bayonetta voice actress, Jennifer Hale, for being capitalist

13:26.160 --> 13:27.820
excel-outs and money-grubbers.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.100
In response to this new information, Taylor put out a list of charities she thought deserves

13:32.100 --> 13:34.660
your money more than Nintendo and Platinum Games.

13:34.660 --> 13:38.380
A closer inspection of the list revealed, however, that one of the charities was an

13:38.380 --> 13:43.460
anti-abortion group, and in real time, we watched the Game Journo narrative change from

13:43.460 --> 13:47.380
support this oppressed member of the proletariat, this passionate creative who just wants to

13:47.380 --> 13:52.460
get paid what she's owed by her exploitative capitalist boss, to string this bitch up for

13:52.460 --> 13:55.680
holding, whatever you might think of it, a relatively common political stance.

13:55.720 --> 14:00.500
It's a wonder to behold that these leftoids were completely fine with her blatantly lying

14:00.500 --> 14:01.720
about her contract.

14:01.720 --> 14:04.400
All of that is forgiven because fuck the corpos.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.400
But now she's pro-life?

14:05.400 --> 14:07.440
Oh, that's too far.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.680
Third and final.

14:08.680 --> 14:12.160
I bet you're wondering, Dev, how do you know these people are all leftoids?

14:12.160 --> 14:16.160
You don't necessarily need to be a leftist to think someone's getting paid poorly and

14:16.160 --> 14:18.080
want to see their conditions improve.

14:18.080 --> 14:22.000
It might not be the case that Viola is wearing the progressive skin suit of the Bayonetta

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
franchise.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.580
Being sexual content is dumb, but not exclusively leftist.

14:26.580 --> 14:28.640
Why am I making this conversation political?

14:28.640 --> 14:29.920
Well, here's why.

14:29.920 --> 14:35.360
The story of Bayonetta 3 has confirmed, spoilers, in canon, that Bayonetta is straight through

14:35.360 --> 14:39.940
her many, many relationships with Luca across all the different universes.

14:39.940 --> 14:43.940
And for some reason, at the same time as the Helena Taylor shit was kicking off, the entire

14:43.940 --> 14:49.720
plot of the game was leaked to Twitter, causing LGBT Twitter to go into full meltdown mode.

14:49.720 --> 15:01.680
It's not misandry-speaking when I say Bayonetta should be a lesbian.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.800
I could never, in good conscience, unleash on a normal-ass man.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.880
Luca was getting strapped to literal rockets in Bayonetta 1.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.100
That poor soul does not stand a chance.

15:10.100 --> 15:14.840
To be fair, there is a recurring theme in specifically lesbian-oriented storytelling,

15:14.840 --> 15:18.640
where the women characters are sexy and powerful and competent, and the men are attracted to

15:18.640 --> 15:22.840
them but are stupid and doofy and can't actually keep up, and the woman eventually

15:22.840 --> 15:27.200
falls for another woman because the incompetent men around her can't match her energy.

15:27.200 --> 15:31.680
These people were hoping that this was Bayonetta's dynamic with Luca, because Bayonetta is sexy

15:31.680 --> 15:35.660
and powerful and competent, Luca is the comic relief, and Bayonetta is often paired with

15:35.660 --> 15:38.740
John, another sexy and powerful and competent woman.

15:38.740 --> 15:43.480
And Bayonetta literally goes to hell to save her in the second game, so yeah, fair enough.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.520
The tropes of lesbian fiction are all here.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.360
I will say, though, this isn't Nintendo committing a crime against the gays.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.680
It's just a video game.

15:49.680 --> 15:54.200
What really kicked this off, though, was some they-them game journal over at Paste magazine,

15:54.200 --> 15:57.820
which is both the name of her workplace and the lunch she brought in, who said,

15:57.820 --> 15:59.320
Do straight guys love this?

15:59.320 --> 16:00.920
I truly find it hard to believe.

16:00.920 --> 16:01.920
I'm sorry.

16:01.920 --> 16:02.920
I just don't believe it.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.600
I don't believe straight men are into this sexually.

16:04.600 --> 16:05.600
What do you mean?

16:05.600 --> 16:09.240
You can't believe straight guys are into amazingly hot women whose tits and ass are hanging out

16:09.240 --> 16:11.760
and who runs around in skin-tight black clothing?

16:11.760 --> 16:13.080
What exactly are you missing here?

16:13.080 --> 16:14.680
Who is the gazer in Bayonetta?

16:14.680 --> 16:16.240
I genuinely have no idea.

16:16.240 --> 16:20.160
I don't know who looks at a woman's body in the way the camera observes Bayonetta other

16:20.160 --> 16:21.160
than queer people.

16:21.160 --> 16:24.640
There's a huge reason why the game attracted a big queer audience.

16:24.640 --> 16:29.200
I think thinking about it in terms of story is not exactly describing what queer players

16:29.200 --> 16:30.480
are picking up about Bayonetta.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.400
It's got very gay vibes.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.800
It shoots for objectification and lands on camp.

16:34.800 --> 16:39.740
The best part of this argument is that radfems like Anita Sarkeesian back in 2014 were saying

16:39.740 --> 16:41.880
the exact opposite of this shit.

16:41.880 --> 16:46.800
That Bayonetta's design, mechanics, and characterization is created specifically for the sexual pleasure

16:46.800 --> 16:48.800
of straight male gamers.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.760
And now we've got people crying that Bayonetta is confirmed straight in canon.

16:52.760 --> 16:56.560
Seeing the Bayonetta discourse go from this is the gross male gaze, women would never

16:56.560 --> 17:01.560
like this, to men would never like Bayonetta, she's empowering to women, is fucking wild.

17:01.560 --> 17:04.760
If there's anything that tells me that the concept of the male gaze is bullshit, at least

17:04.760 --> 17:10.280
how these people view it, it's watching literally the exact same images morphed from disgusting

17:10.280 --> 17:15.040
male-centric fetishization to empowering lesbian-centric queerness right before my

17:15.040 --> 17:16.040
eyes.

17:16.040 --> 17:20.120
The problem with that tropes of lesbian fiction view of the topic, though, isn't just that

17:20.120 --> 17:24.600
the whole thing collapses into copium when the creator says she's straight, actually.

17:24.600 --> 17:29.600
It's that in their copium is the idea that Bayonetta cannot be strong, sexy, or competent

17:29.600 --> 17:31.040
if she's in love with a man.

17:31.040 --> 17:35.640
And that is the angle that Polygon editor and lobotomy patient Mattie Myers took.

17:35.640 --> 17:38.900
This is a long stupid article, like all the nonsense these people put out, but the central

17:38.900 --> 17:42.420
thesis is this, making Bayonetta straight undermines her character.

17:42.420 --> 17:45.340
Myers doesn't like the man she ended up with, or that she ended up with a man at all.

17:45.340 --> 17:49.260
And after Myers got clapped back for this take, she posted online that of course the

17:49.260 --> 17:53.500
game was doing well, it was the straight men who were buying it and rating it online.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.820
The game was made explicitly for them.

17:55.820 --> 17:58.020
There's a lot of problems with this logic, let's run them all down.

17:58.020 --> 18:01.340
One, Bayonetta being confirmed as straight doesn't happen until the end of the game.

18:01.340 --> 18:04.920
And when you put this tweet out, it wasn't really widespread knowledge yet, people were

18:04.920 --> 18:06.080
still playing through it.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.680
If Bayonetta being confirmed straight would lead to a bump, it wouldn't have happened

18:09.680 --> 18:10.680
yet.

18:10.680 --> 18:14.640
Two, Bayonetta always got consistently high scores from fans, and even though I don't

18:14.640 --> 18:18.260
like Bayonetta 3 personally, I can accept the idea that they might all get relatively

18:18.260 --> 18:19.260
similar scores.

18:19.260 --> 18:24.280
Three, Mattie, your view of Bayonetta 1 and 2 was that it had an obvious queerness to

18:24.280 --> 18:27.520
it, so much so that Bayonetta 3 has disappointed you.

18:27.520 --> 18:31.420
From your point of view, if Bayonetta 3 is only getting high scores because it's made

18:31.420 --> 18:37.020
for men, why did Bayonetta 1 and 2 get similarly high scores if it was made for the queers

18:37.020 --> 18:38.200
as you see it?

18:38.200 --> 18:42.780
And four, I don't believe that Mattie Meyers, or any other game journalist, or any of these

18:42.780 --> 18:46.520
fucking crying twitter plebs are actually fans of Bayonetta.

18:46.520 --> 18:47.740
You wanna know why?

18:47.740 --> 18:51.840
Because Bayonetta says she's straight, or at least into men and therefore bi in the

18:51.840 --> 19:01.340
first fucking game.

19:01.380 --> 19:05.460
Here is what actually happened in the minds of all of these sexuality-questioning millennial

19:05.460 --> 19:10.180
teens who grew up to be obnoxious identity politics riddled officers of the Twitterati.

19:10.180 --> 19:14.940
You saw a strong, sexy, competent woman in Bayonetta, who existed in a game with an over-the-top

19:14.940 --> 19:16.980
style that is, yeah, pretty campy.

19:16.980 --> 19:22.020
You saw that she had a strong, sexy, competent foil in John, who is just as flamboyant and

19:22.020 --> 19:25.700
dominatrix-like as her, and you imagined them together.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.200
Maybe you even got off to fan porn of it or something.

19:28.200 --> 19:34.040
And because you are your own toxic stereotype of the LGBTQ community, whatever the fuck

19:34.040 --> 19:39.380
that is, you instantly think that a strong, sexy, competent woman who wears fetish clothing

19:39.380 --> 19:42.760
and has a dominant personality has to be gay.

19:42.760 --> 19:47.940
But she doesn't, because no matter how many family-friendly drag shows you popularize,

19:47.940 --> 19:52.960
or outdoor BDSM displays go marching down the street on Pride Month, being gay does

19:52.960 --> 19:57.720
not actually require you to be a walking display of gaudy sexuality.

19:57.760 --> 20:02.600
Saying that Bayonetta has to be a lesbian, look how hypersexual she is, is a more toxic

20:02.600 --> 20:07.840
attitude towards lesbians than anything I've ever heard a conservative say in over 20 years

20:07.840 --> 20:08.840
now.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.800
Those guys, worst case scenario, they'll call you a dyke and move on.

20:11.800 --> 20:15.440
They're not going to demand you start drinking your partner's piss in public or you're

20:15.440 --> 20:16.560
not actually gay.

20:16.560 --> 20:20.700
All of this insanity surrounding Bayonetta 3 is what the game is now known for.

20:20.700 --> 20:23.600
The voice actor stuff, the gay stuff, no one actually talks about the quality of the game

20:23.600 --> 20:24.600
itself.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.960
And that's probably for the best, because it is mediocre and disappointing.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.560
I don't care that Bayonetta is straight.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.380
Frankly, the story actually does make more sense for her to be with John.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.300
They do have two games of history together.

20:33.300 --> 20:38.200
The problem is that Bayonetta 3 fully disregards those two games of history in many ways, not

20:38.200 --> 20:40.080
just with her relationship with John.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.520
All this online nonsense surrounding the release was pretty fun.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.720
But once you get past all that, you have a game that frankly, I wouldn't recommend

20:45.720 --> 20:48.200
picking up unless you were a hardcore Bayonetta fan.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.440
And if you are, you've already got it.
