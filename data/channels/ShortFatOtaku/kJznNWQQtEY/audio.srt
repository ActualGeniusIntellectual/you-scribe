1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,260
We've had our hands on Bayonetta 3 for a little while now, and I think we can officially

2
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,020
say, this game is cursed.

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,620
It's had so many problems and controversies that have all overshadowed the game itself,

4
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,380
which to be honest is pretty mediocre.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,700
But before we begin, I should give you a short primer on what Bayonetta actually is.

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,040
Bayonetta is a game where you play as Bayonetta, the Umbra Witch.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,340
She made a deal with a demon, Madame Butterfly, to gain otherworldly powers, namely slow motion

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,480
magic, enchanted guns, and the ability to summon demons made out of her hair.

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,800
In fact, her entire suit is made up of her hair, and as you execute combos in the game,

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,840
Bayonetta uses her magical abilities, causing parts of her costume to come undone and attack

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,840
the enemies.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,660
The better you are at the game, the more skin you see, and that's really all there is to

13
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,660
it.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,300
Bayonetta feels like playing a flash of your Devil May Cry, with the added boob factor.

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,460
And back in 2009 when the first Bayonetta game was still new, this was basically the

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,580
view of it on the internet.

17
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,080
You can go back and watch the old Zero Punctuation review, or the short Game Grumps series where

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,680
they make fun of the ridiculous premise of the game, while still at least complimenting

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,000
it for its gameplay.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,680
Meanwhile, Bayonetta fans on 4chan or Game Facts loved the game, not just for its sex

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,060
appeal, though they certainly loved that, but also for its high skill ceiling, replayability,

22
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,240
and quirky style.

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,240
Meanwhile online feminists, who did exist back in 2009, though far less in number and

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,660
nobody really cared about them, cried incessantly at how sexist or objectifying Bayonetta was.

25
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:38,620
Nowadays Bayonetta is considered a cult classic, but not a critical success, leading everyone

26
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,540
to believe that it would be one of those thousands of one and done games that littered the 2000s.

27
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,920
But to everyone's surprise, Bayonetta was revived in the Wii U in 2014 with Bayonetta

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
2!

29
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,060
Nintendo picked the franchise up and funded a sequel out of nowhere, making it Nintendo

30
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,360
exclusive in the process.

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,960
And to everyone's astonishment, it wasn't dumbed down just because it's Nintendo.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,400
Bayonetta 2 remained just as sexual and over-the-top as Bayonetta 1, clearly a nod to the fans.

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,280
And the game played exactly the same way, same combos, same items.

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,960
Some of it felt a little bit cheap, like they just reused parts of Bayonetta 1, but at the

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,740
end of the day, it's more Bayonetta, and that's what everyone wanted.

36
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,320
With the massive success of the Nintendo Switch, people felt Bayonetta 3 would come along eventually.

37
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
And it did.

38
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,800
And my god, this game is far inferior.

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,980
The combos are drastically different enough that the game legitimately feels strange to

40
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,980
play.

41
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,260
They didn't add to what was there before, they changed everything.

42
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,340
Bayonetta moves differently, like the game feel is fundamentally different.

43
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,820
The weapons feel alien, and actually, the weapon choices are a fair bit shallower than

44
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,020
the first two games.

45
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,220
And then there's just a lot of stylistic choices that I don't really get why they

46
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,220
change.

47
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,780
For example, Bayonetta's sprint form is no longer a Black Panther, but instead Madam

48
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,880
Butterfly.

49
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,420
Change can be good, you don't want a series like this to get stagnant.

50
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,040
But this time around, the things that were changed were a part of what a lot of fans

51
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,460
viewed as Bayonetta's core identity.

52
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,040
Which brings us to the story.

53
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,320
Bayonetta 1 was a pretty straightforward plot, and yes, there's going to be spoilers for

54
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
all three games in this.

55
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,780
In the first game, Bayonetta travels to the fictional European city-state of Vigrid looking

56
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,920
for the fabled Eyes of the World, a duo of artifacts that when brought together grant

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,200
godlike powers.

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,680
Bayonetta's already got one eye, and she's after the other.

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,540
She's also an amnesiac, and it turns out that the child hanging around with her is actually

60
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,320
herself from the past, brought to the present by the last Lumen Sage, who are the mortal

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,860
enemies of the Umbra Witches.

62
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,820
In order to restore Bayonetta's memories, because he's actually her father and...okay,

63
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,840
maybe the story's a bit more complicated than I thought.

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,240
The point is, Bayonetta 2 continues this very same type of thing.

65
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Sages and witches, fighting angels and demons, lots of gothic architecture and magic and

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,700
cool bullet-time fights.

67
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:42,380
The series has a very distinctive style, and Bayonetta 3 respected exactly 0% of it.

68
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,500
The story of Bayonetta 3 isn't connected to Bayonetta fighting her father, the last

69
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,460
Lumen Sage, like in Bayonetta 1.

70
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,220
Nor is it connected to Bayonetta fighting the god of Chaos, Acer, to whom the Eyes of

71
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,380
the World originally belonged, like in Bayonetta 2.

72
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,640
Bayonetta 3 is about how the world is actually made up of an infinite amount of timelines,

73
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,460
and how man-made bioweapons are rampaging across each timeline, destroying and consuming

74
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,500
them in order to become more powerful.

75
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,340
And each timeline has its own Bayonetta, and alternate-universe versions of the other characters

76
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,940
too, who have been repeatedly losing in the defense of their own worlds.

77
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,360
In other words, rather than a story about traveling to heaven and hell, we have a story

78
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,660
about time travel and alternate universes.

79
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,480
A newcomer to the cast is Viola, who looks to be straight out of Suicide Girls, and is

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,020
an Umbra Witch in training from an alternate dimension's future who, spoiler alert, is

81
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,060
the daughter of that dimension's Bayonetta and Luca, the comic relief dude from the first

82
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,180
two games, who time traveled back to our present after her parents died, she's literally

83
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,180
just Trunks.

84
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,540
Trunks' plotline is identical to Trunks, she's even got the sword, the jacket, she's

85
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,540
Trunks.

86
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,100
This is not necessarily a bad plot, Trunks' hero's journey is probably the most compelling

87
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,620
plotline in Dragon Ball, combining personal tragedy, loss of a mentor against an overwhelmingly

88
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,100
powerful evil, a young person who has potential but isn't really ready yet but they're

89
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,180
the best we've got, and a last-ditch desperate one-way trip to an unfamiliar past to try

90
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,320
and set things right.

91
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,700
The issue is, this is nothing like what Bayonetta is supposed to be.

92
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,820
Again, I'm not saying that change is always bad, but you're changing the foundations

93
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,900
of the lore here.

94
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,020
All the old lore and the conflicts aren't necessarily overwritten, they're just sidelined

95
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,460
so much because the developer wanted to tell some new story about human bioweapons and

96
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,380
alternate universes that wasn't even hinted at before.

97
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,480
Viola ends up being the second playable character of Bayonetta 3, and she's different enough

98
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
to warrant it.

99
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,380
Instead of a double jump, she has a grappling hook.

100
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,380
Instead of dodging to activate Witch Time, you have to parry with her sword, and her

101
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,780
combos are noticeably different from Bayonetta's.

102
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,040
Which makes me wonder why they had to make Bayonetta Control so drastically differently

103
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,180
from the first two games if they were already going to have a character who controls drastically

104
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,640
differently herself.

105
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,020
It's around the time of the first Viola level in the playthrough that I noticed Bayonetta

106
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,200
includes a skill tree, something that the first two games didn't have.

107
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,600
I guess that's probably where some of the complexity from the other in-game systems

108
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
went.

109
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,480
It's nothing too crazy, bog-standard stuff, but I came to a realization just looking over

110
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
the various upgrades.

111
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,440
Viola's skill tree is about three times as big as Bayonetta's.

112
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,040
In other words, you're expected to invest three times the EXP into Viola over Bayonetta.

113
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,800
They couldn't make you play as Viola, the new Pussy Riot Tumblr self-insert character,

114
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,760
more than Bayonetta in a game called Bayonetta, could they?

115
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,160
Well, they do.

116
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,320
And not only that, but, spoilers again for the ending, the Prime Universe's Bayonetta

117
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,780
dies and tells Viola she's the new Bayonetta.

118
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,160
The end of the game shows Viola just chilling with the other characters, like Bayonetta

119
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,120
would, implying that she's just going to be the hero now going forward.

120
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,880
This is yet another case of the new entry into a beloved property introducing a new

121
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,040
character that the author actually wants you to care about, and spends the entire thing

122
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,040
kicking aside everything you loved about the previous story in order to pump up the new

123
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
hero.

124
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,920
And yes, bad news, this is actually happening even in Japanese games now.

125
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,200
The western skinsuit rot has slowly but finally crept its way over to Japan, primarily through

126
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,480
the indie scene.

127
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,640
One symptom of it that isn't unique to Japanese games, but maybe a little bit more prominent

128
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,440
in them, is the amount of fourth-wall breaking, self-referential fluffing the games tend to

129
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
do.

130
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,440
Look at No More Heroes, for example.

131
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,400
The first No More Heroes, published around the same time as the first Bayonetta in fact,

132
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,040
only slightly broke the fourth wall.

133
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,860
It had subtlety, well, as much subtlety as a game can have when it's all about chopping

134
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,100
off Mafioso's heads with a lightsaber and watching a geyser of blood and gold coins

135
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
erupt out.

136
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,160
What I mean is, when it got referential, it was quiet, quick, and the developer didn't

137
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,780
care if you missed it.

138
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,760
Compare that to the latest game, No More Heroes 3, published about a year ago.

139
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,100
It has all the same problems as Bayonetta 3.

140
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,720
It feels too different, it looks too different, it controls too different, the styles change

141
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,360
too much, and the developer, rather being subtle, would rather whack you over the head

142
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,080
with all the cutaways to arcade-looking mini-games, or how some of the story is told in a visual

143
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,280
style of a drastically different game, or how, yeah, we're even spoiling No More Heroes

144
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,520
this time, the final boss is literally a Super Smash Bros. match.

145
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,560
This whole, let's remove the gameplay loop that you love and replace it with an old arcade

146
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,020
game thing is even in Bayonetta 3, where the story is periodically interrupted to cut

147
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,840
away to John doing some sort of platformer stealth thing that you might have seen in

148
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,840
the 1980s.

149
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,920
Why do we gotta do this?

150
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,860
I bought Bayonetta to play Bayonetta.

151
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,760
I bought No More Heroes to play No More Heroes, not to have the developer wank off all over

152
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
me.

153
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,120
So we're like halfway into this Indefensible video, and I haven't even talked about the

154
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,560
actual controversy surrounding Bayonetta 3.

155
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,280
Yeah, this isn't strictly a game review channel, as much as I love doing let's plays and streams

156
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,480
and reviewing games.

157
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,680
This wouldn't be an Indefensible if there wasn't another angle to talk about.

158
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,040
And that other angle, the controversy surrounding this game, went viral so much, I bet that

159
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,920
most of you who didn't play the game only knew about those controversies.

160
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,480
You probably haven't even heard the game is actually shit yet.

161
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,640
Let's go in order from the least to most hilarious.

162
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,440
First, Naive Angel Mode.

163
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,780
Remember when I said earlier that Bayonetta is known for its sex appeal, with Bayonetta

164
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,520
stripping in order to use her clothing as a component of her magic?

165
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,160
Well, in case you didn't like tits for some reason, you can now turn on Naive Angel Mode,

166
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,120
which completely censors the sexual content right out of the game.

167
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,440
No more Madame Butterfly's ass hanging out, none of it.

168
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,140
I mean, it's kinda cucked, sure, but at least they didn't just censor the whole game entirely

169
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,040
and make everyone play without the sexy stuff.

170
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,600
I just don't see the point of it, though.

171
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,600
The style of Bayonetta is over-the-top ridiculous sexuality.

172
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,040
Without that, you really just kinda have a mediocre beat-em-up.

173
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,400
I will never not find it funny that in 2007 when Mass Effect came out, and you could see

174
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,320
a lesbian blue alien booty, it was rightoids on Fox News screaming about how the degeneracy

175
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,460
in video games was destroying children's minds, while in 2022 it's the leftoids who are talking

176
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,720
about how progressive and pro-women it is that you can turn off the witch booties in

177
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Bayonetta now.

178
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,760
Oh, by the way, they're still angry because they didn't censor it enough, though.

179
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,840
Also, I haven't tried out Naive Angel Mode myself because I'm not a cuck, but some people

180
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,240
online claim that it actually makes the game easier, and the game's already pretty easy.

181
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,240
This is a literal Game Journal mode for the Patrick Klepics of the world, who think that

182
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,360
they'll go blind if they look at a naked woman.

183
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,600
Second, Helena Taylor.

184
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,280
Oh boy, y'all saw this go viral, didn't you?

185
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,160
Helena Taylor was the voice actress of Bayonetta through all of her appearances in the main

186
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,400
games, as well as other side appearances, until Bayonetta 3.

187
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Why not Bayonetta 3?

188
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,320
Well, hear it from the woman herself.

189
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,280
Bayonetta franchise made an approximated $450 million.

190
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,680
That's not including merchandise.

191
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,700
As an actor, I trained for a total of seven and a half years.

192
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,720
Three years at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, Lambda, with voice coach

193
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:28,080
Barbara Barkery, and four and a half years with the legendary Larry Moss in Los Angeles.

194
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,600
And what did they think this was worth?

195
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,880
What did they offer to pay me?

196
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:45,640
The final offer to do the whole game as a buyout, a flat rate, was $4,000.

197
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,120
In case you don't know, $4,000 is a remarkably low fee for a game with this much voice acting

198
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,920
and this much anticipation behind it.

199
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,880
Bayonetta might have begun as a cult classic, but after Nintendo revived the IP and pumped

200
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,040
a bunch of money into it, it legitimately became a mainstream, more popular franchise.

201
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,360
For the amount of work that Taylor would be expected to do, and the amount of money the

202
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,760
game was projected to make, $4,000 was indeed a rip-off, and because she claimed that her

203
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:36,400
bosses wouldn't negotiate, she called upon Bayonetta fans to boycott

204
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:33,040
the game.

205
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,800
Alright, I guess it's Nintendo's fault that London has stuffed the broom with immigrants,

206
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,520
but it turns out this was all fake.

207
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Jason Schreier, doing the first real reporting of his Game Journo life, got a hold of documentation

208
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,960
from Platinum Games showing that Taylor was offered $4,000 per recording session for at

209
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,560
least five sessions, rounding out to at least $20,000.

210
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,160
In response, Taylor asked for a six-figure paycheck and residuals from the game's sales,

211
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,440
which Platinum rejected.

212
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,920
Taylor later changed her public story, saying she was actually offered $10,000, not $4,000,

213
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,680
and when she emailed Hideki Kamiya for help, the game's director and notorious Twitter

214
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,080
troll, he offered her personally an additional $5,000, which she rejected.

215
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,640
Whichever of these two stories is true, it's not the $4,000 from that viral clip, which

216
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,400
quickly shot up to 9.5 million views, and caused a lot of deranged, left-leaning fans

217
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,160
to attack Platinum Games and the new Bayonetta voice actress, Jennifer Hale, for being capitalist

218
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,820
excel-outs and money-grubbers.

219
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,100
In response to this new information, Taylor put out a list of charities she thought deserves

220
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,660
your money more than Nintendo and Platinum Games.

221
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,380
A closer inspection of the list revealed, however, that one of the charities was an

222
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,460
anti-abortion group, and in real time, we watched the Game Journo narrative change from

223
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,380
support this oppressed member of the proletariat, this passionate creative who just wants to

224
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,460
get paid what she's owed by her exploitative capitalist boss, to string this bitch up for

225
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,680
holding, whatever you might think of it, a relatively common political stance.

226
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,500
It's a wonder to behold that these leftoids were completely fine with her blatantly lying

227
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,720
about her contract.

228
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,400
All of that is forgiven because fuck the corpos.

229
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
But now she's pro-life?

230
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,440
Oh, that's too far.

231
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,680
Third and final.

232
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,160
I bet you're wondering, Dev, how do you know these people are all leftoids?

233
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,160
You don't necessarily need to be a leftist to think someone's getting paid poorly and

234
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,080
want to see their conditions improve.

235
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,000
It might not be the case that Viola is wearing the progressive skin suit of the Bayonetta

236
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
franchise.

237
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,580
Being sexual content is dumb, but not exclusively leftist.

238
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,640
Why am I making this conversation political?

239
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,920
Well, here's why.

240
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,360
The story of Bayonetta 3 has confirmed, spoilers, in canon, that Bayonetta is straight through

241
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,940
her many, many relationships with Luca across all the different universes.

242
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,940
And for some reason, at the same time as the Helena Taylor shit was kicking off, the entire

243
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,720
plot of the game was leaked to Twitter, causing LGBT Twitter to go into full meltdown mode.

244
00:14:49,720 --> 00:15:01,680
It's not misandry-speaking when I say Bayonetta should be a lesbian.

245
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,800
I could never, in good conscience, unleash on a normal-ass man.

246
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,880
Luca was getting strapped to literal rockets in Bayonetta 1.

247
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,100
That poor soul does not stand a chance.

248
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,840
To be fair, there is a recurring theme in specifically lesbian-oriented storytelling,

249
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,640
where the women characters are sexy and powerful and competent, and the men are attracted to

250
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,840
them but are stupid and doofy and can't actually keep up, and the woman eventually

251
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,200
falls for another woman because the incompetent men around her can't match her energy.

252
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,680
These people were hoping that this was Bayonetta's dynamic with Luca, because Bayonetta is sexy

253
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,660
and powerful and competent, Luca is the comic relief, and Bayonetta is often paired with

254
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,740
John, another sexy and powerful and competent woman.

255
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,480
And Bayonetta literally goes to hell to save her in the second game, so yeah, fair enough.

256
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,520
The tropes of lesbian fiction are all here.

257
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,360
I will say, though, this isn't Nintendo committing a crime against the gays.

258
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,680
It's just a video game.

259
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,200
What really kicked this off, though, was some they-them game journal over at Paste magazine,

260
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,820
which is both the name of her workplace and the lunch she brought in, who said,

261
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,320
Do straight guys love this?

262
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,920
I truly find it hard to believe.

263
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
I'm sorry.

264
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
I just don't believe it.

265
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,600
I don't believe straight men are into this sexually.

266
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
What do you mean?

267
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,240
You can't believe straight guys are into amazingly hot women whose tits and ass are hanging out

268
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,760
and who runs around in skin-tight black clothing?

269
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,080
What exactly are you missing here?

270
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,680
Who is the gazer in Bayonetta?

271
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,240
I genuinely have no idea.

272
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,160
I don't know who looks at a woman's body in the way the camera observes Bayonetta other

273
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,160
than queer people.

274
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,640
There's a huge reason why the game attracted a big queer audience.

275
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,200
I think thinking about it in terms of story is not exactly describing what queer players

276
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,480
are picking up about Bayonetta.

277
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,400
It's got very gay vibes.

278
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,800
It shoots for objectification and lands on camp.

279
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,740
The best part of this argument is that radfems like Anita Sarkeesian back in 2014 were saying

280
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,880
the exact opposite of this shit.

281
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,800
That Bayonetta's design, mechanics, and characterization is created specifically for the sexual pleasure

282
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
of straight male gamers.

283
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,760
And now we've got people crying that Bayonetta is confirmed straight in canon.

284
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,560
Seeing the Bayonetta discourse go from this is the gross male gaze, women would never

285
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,560
like this, to men would never like Bayonetta, she's empowering to women, is fucking wild.

286
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,760
If there's anything that tells me that the concept of the male gaze is bullshit, at least

287
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,280
how these people view it, it's watching literally the exact same images morphed from disgusting

288
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,040
male-centric fetishization to empowering lesbian-centric queerness right before my

289
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
eyes.

290
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,120
The problem with that tropes of lesbian fiction view of the topic, though, isn't just that

291
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,600
the whole thing collapses into copium when the creator says she's straight, actually.

292
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,600
It's that in their copium is the idea that Bayonetta cannot be strong, sexy, or competent

293
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,040
if she's in love with a man.

294
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,640
And that is the angle that Polygon editor and lobotomy patient Mattie Myers took.

295
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,900
This is a long stupid article, like all the nonsense these people put out, but the central

296
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,420
thesis is this, making Bayonetta straight undermines her character.

297
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,340
Myers doesn't like the man she ended up with, or that she ended up with a man at all.

298
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,260
And after Myers got clapped back for this take, she posted online that of course the

299
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,500
game was doing well, it was the straight men who were buying it and rating it online.

300
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,820
The game was made explicitly for them.

301
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,020
There's a lot of problems with this logic, let's run them all down.

302
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,340
One, Bayonetta being confirmed as straight doesn't happen until the end of the game.

303
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,920
And when you put this tweet out, it wasn't really widespread knowledge yet, people were

304
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,080
still playing through it.

305
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,680
If Bayonetta being confirmed straight would lead to a bump, it wouldn't have happened

306
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
yet.

307
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,640
Two, Bayonetta always got consistently high scores from fans, and even though I don't

308
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,260
like Bayonetta 3 personally, I can accept the idea that they might all get relatively

309
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,260
similar scores.

310
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,280
Three, Mattie, your view of Bayonetta 1 and 2 was that it had an obvious queerness to

311
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,520
it, so much so that Bayonetta 3 has disappointed you.

312
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,420
From your point of view, if Bayonetta 3 is only getting high scores because it's made

313
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:37,020
for men, why did Bayonetta 1 and 2 get similarly high scores if it was made for the queers

314
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,200
as you see it?

315
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,780
And four, I don't believe that Mattie Meyers, or any other game journalist, or any of these

316
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,520
fucking crying twitter plebs are actually fans of Bayonetta.

317
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,740
You wanna know why?

318
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:51,840
Because Bayonetta says she's straight, or at least into men and therefore bi in the

319
00:18:51,840 --> 00:19:01,340
first fucking game.

320
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,460
Here is what actually happened in the minds of all of these sexuality-questioning millennial

321
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,180
teens who grew up to be obnoxious identity politics riddled officers of the Twitterati.

322
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,940
You saw a strong, sexy, competent woman in Bayonetta, who existed in a game with an over-the-top

323
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,980
style that is, yeah, pretty campy.

324
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,020
You saw that she had a strong, sexy, competent foil in John, who is just as flamboyant and

325
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,700
dominatrix-like as her, and you imagined them together.

326
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,200
Maybe you even got off to fan porn of it or something.

327
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,040
And because you are your own toxic stereotype of the LGBTQ community, whatever the fuck

328
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,380
that is, you instantly think that a strong, sexy, competent woman who wears fetish clothing

329
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,760
and has a dominant personality has to be gay.

330
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:47,940
But she doesn't, because no matter how many family-friendly drag shows you popularize,

331
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,960
or outdoor BDSM displays go marching down the street on Pride Month, being gay does

332
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,720
not actually require you to be a walking display of gaudy sexuality.

333
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,600
Saying that Bayonetta has to be a lesbian, look how hypersexual she is, is a more toxic

334
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,840
attitude towards lesbians than anything I've ever heard a conservative say in over 20 years

335
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
now.

336
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,800
Those guys, worst case scenario, they'll call you a dyke and move on.

337
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,440
They're not going to demand you start drinking your partner's piss in public or you're

338
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,560
not actually gay.

339
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,700
All of this insanity surrounding Bayonetta 3 is what the game is now known for.

340
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,600
The voice actor stuff, the gay stuff, no one actually talks about the quality of the game

341
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
itself.

342
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,960
And that's probably for the best, because it is mediocre and disappointing.

343
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,560
I don't care that Bayonetta is straight.

344
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,380
Frankly, the story actually does make more sense for her to be with John.

345
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,300
They do have two games of history together.

346
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,200
The problem is that Bayonetta 3 fully disregards those two games of history in many ways, not

347
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,080
just with her relationship with John.

348
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,520
All this online nonsense surrounding the release was pretty fun.

349
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,720
But once you get past all that, you have a game that frankly, I wouldn't recommend

350
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,200
picking up unless you were a hardcore Bayonetta fan.

351
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,440
And if you are, you've already got it.
