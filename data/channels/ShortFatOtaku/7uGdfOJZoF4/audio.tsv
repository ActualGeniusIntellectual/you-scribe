0	15520	Hey guys, Dev here.
15520	18820	I hope everyone is having a great time at this year's Game Developer Conference.
18820	21680	I know Gamergate did, at least with the GDC hashtags.
21680	25280	And because we over at the Sharp Play Otaku channel are opportunistic twats, I'd like
25280	27720	to talk to you about something related to the GDC.
27720	30760	Namely, the International Game Developers Association.
30760	34480	Here is a brief history taken from the IGDA's own website.
34480	40100	The IGDA was initially established in 1994 by Ernest Adams as the CGDA, the Computer
40100	41760	Game Developers Association.
41760	45480	Its main reason for being was to give game developers a unified voice in the wake of
45480	48780	the video game debates happening in the American Congress that same year.
48780	52800	In the Escapist's article on the subject, titled Let's Get Together, Adams describes
52800	54440	the founding in greater detail.
54640	59500	According to his own words, Adams went to the CGDC board and asked them to let him create
59500	64520	the CGDA as a department of the conference itself, an association within the business.
64520	69440	The CGDC he's referring to is the Computer Game Developer Conference, which would later
69440	71280	become today's GDC.
71280	76120	The IGDA began as a division of the GDC, back when the GDC was his own company.
76120	80880	In 1995, the IGDA's predecessor became an independent organization, even though its
80880	83880	members and staff were still the members and staff of the GDC.
83880	89120	Adams says the IGDA's primary function was, and is, to support the careers and interests
89120	91820	of developers as individuals, not companies.
91820	95680	Which is a fine goal, but I'm not convinced the IGDA actually has game developers' best
95680	96680	interests at heart.
96680	103200	Around the same time as the IGDA's birth, the CGDC was sold to UBM, and became the GDC
103200	104360	we know and love today.
104360	108280	UBM is the parent company of Indie Games Fest, which I've already talked about at length
108280	112760	in another video, and Gamasutra, one of the corrupt publications that Gamergate is boycotting.
112760	118280	Officially, the IGDA did become its own separate entity from the GDC, or any other UBM-owned
118280	120720	properties, but on paper it didn't quite work that way.
120720	127280	The IGDA employed CMP for operations and management services up until 2004, CMP being what UBM
127280	129000	called itself before a name change.
129000	133200	Even after 2004, there continues to be significant crossover between the two organizations.
133200	135720	Now let's take a step back and look at the whole picture.
135720	140760	The IGDA is an association that brings developers together to have a unified political voice,
140760	144600	to have them collaborate and push each other's work, and to stand up for their own collective
144600	145600	interests.
145600	149960	It's almost like a union, however not really, although an anonymous indie dev who spoke
149960	155080	to us expressed the hope that it one day would grow into a full-fledged union for game devs,
155080	156080	but more on that later.
156080	162160	Now, the IGDA sprung up from the same roots as the GDC, and was owned for a time by UBM,
162160	164720	and still has significant membership and staff crossover.
164720	168160	This is what is known as, in other industries, creating a cabal.
168400	170320	Suppose you were a small developer starting out.
170320	173320	Do you want to have a fair shot at your game winning in the IGF?
173320	175660	Do you want to have your work covered by Gamasutra?
175660	177280	Do you want to show off your game at GDC?
177280	181440	Well, if so, you're going to have to join this developers association, which claims
181440	185560	to speak for your rights, but is financially and socially intertwined with the parent company
185560	187540	of all these other events and outlets.
187540	192400	The IGDA and UBM have essentially created a gateway to enter the gaming industry.
192400	194840	The message they've sent to indie devs is clear.
194840	198800	If you want to be a part of this industry, fall in line with us.
198800	202680	It's blatantly unethical for award shows, journalism publications, and public conferences
202680	206440	to have these ties with a union-like association that claims to represent the interests of
206440	208360	its members in an unbiased manner.
208360	212440	Not only is there no guarantee that the association won't pander to the interests of its corporate
212440	216800	buddies rather than its members, there is also the obvious avenues for favoritism towards
216800	220320	members over non-members at these supposedly fair events.
220320	223640	This would be like if you worked in a factory, and the union that represents you was originally
223640	227560	owned by the same parent company as the factory, and the union's staff were all the same
227560	228960	people that ran the factory.
228960	231620	Do you think you would be fairly represented in a dispute?
231620	234000	And we can't forget the whole blockbot debacle.
234000	237400	People opposed to gamer gits investigations into their unethical practices, and who wanted
237400	241500	to push a narrative of harassment over the truth of corruption, created a blockbot.
241500	246480	The public face of what would become known as the GG autoblocker was Randy Harper, but
246480	248160	its creation involved a lot of people.
248160	253280	GG autoblocker, when used, would automatically block a list of users on Twitter who were
253320	256120	determined to have been pro-gamergate and therefore anti-corruption.
256120	261440	However, GG autoblocker only became relevant when the IGDA began using it, and in doing
261440	266600	so, began to block indie devs who had spoken out against corruption, including its own members.
266600	272240	The IGDA publicly endorsed the blockbot, even as its own Puerto Rico chairman, Roberto Rosario,
272240	276560	was blocked by it for his objection to Jordy Tate's comment that all gamergaters be sent
276560	278440	to Nazi gas chambers.
278440	282540	In retaliation, the Puerto Rico chapter of the IGDA was closed.
282540	287380	The shitstorm that descended upon the IGDA by its own blocked members was colossal.
287380	292940	What didn't help is that the list that the GG autoblocker used was distinctly called
292940	297240	the blacklist, and that companies colluding to blacklist individuals from the industry
297240	299140	is illegal under US law.
299140	304060	The IGDA quickly backpedaled, with the current chair, Kate Edwards, saying that the blacklist
304060	308540	bot was a third-party tool, that they weren't involved in its construction, and that the
308540	310620	IGDA will stop using it.
310620	312140	Except that none of it was true.
312140	316740	One day before Edwards' denial of involvement on Twitter, Donna Prior said that a bunch
316740	322820	of people had their fingers in the blacklist bot, with WIG taking the major load of work.
322820	328820	WIG is the IGDA's women's games group, and Donna Prior works for the IGDA in several
328820	329860	capacities.
329860	332220	And despite what they've said, the IGDA still uses it.
332220	336740	Camera ladies never spoke to Kate Edwards before, and yet here she is, blocked.
336740	340960	Not only does the IGDA endorse the blacklist bot, it's no third-party tool.
340960	345760	It was created by a division of the IGDA to block its own members who speak out about
345760	349360	corruption, and they continue to use it to this day despite the lies they told to get
349360	351080	indie devs off their back.
351080	353600	Now here's where things begin to get really interesting.
353600	357160	A number of indie devs have actually been willing to speak with camera lady on this
357160	358160	topic.
358160	361640	Some were entirely okay with going public, while others wanted their names censored out
361640	364280	of fear of reprisal from the IGDA.
364280	368760	Pixelmetal, the dev of the indie game Sombrero, said that most indies are wary of pissing
368760	373560	off the IGDA, due to the collaborations and promotions the IGDA provides.
373560	379080	Many people simply aren't willing to talk about the IGDA, the IGF, GDC, or Gamasutra
379080	380840	due to the Cabal's influence.
380840	385000	Another person camera lady spoke to about the IGDA and its unethical links to UBM's
385000	389200	properties, who never specified about whether or not he wanted to remain anonymous, so we've
389200	394240	erred on the side of caution and censored him just in case, said Silverstring, Lego
394240	396280	Butts, Ismail, Shafer.
396280	397920	All their relationships and collaboration.
397920	400320	Quinn got caught out by being a manipulative asshole.
400320	404580	But as a game dev, it became apparent that there was a definite web of cool kids.
404580	409040	Many with no actual game dev skills, just loudly supporting causes.
409040	413400	They trick new game devs into thinking they're the top, but they're simply the loudest.
413400	416180	The real game devs are mostly too busy working.
416180	420460	The anonymous indie dev from earlier, who hoped the IGDA would eventually reform and
420460	425200	become a full-fledged union, has a different opinion on the IGDA than everyone else.
425200	430240	Thus far, evidence points towards UBM and the IGDA working together to create a gateway
430240	435560	into the gaming industry, with the IGDA acting as UBM's enforcement arm to keep questioning
435560	436920	developers in line.
436920	439560	However, this individual paints a different light.
439560	444280	They say that the IGDA doesn't act as UBM's muscle, but rather it is intimidated itself
444280	447800	by UBM, just as much as individual developers are.
447800	452000	The IGDA itself is a very fickle organization that tends to go whichever way the wind is
452000	453000	blowing.
453240	456280	Right now, UBM asserts the most pressure, so it sides with them.
456280	460920	However, the potential is there for the IGDA to become an ally of ethics in our industry
460920	463440	if UBM's stranglehold on them is broken.
463440	467440	Now this analysis of events is just as plausible as the more commonly held viewpoint that the
467440	470080	IGDA is complicit in the suppression of developers.
470080	472520	But at this point, the question must be asked.
472520	477520	If the IGDA is not the tool that UBM uses to enforce order on developers, then what
477520	478520	is?
478560	483000	The autonomous dev says that UBM directly strongarms devs who step out of line with
483000	488800	general social engineering, but also GDC access, gamasutra coverage, and the IGF, making the
488800	493840	IGF significantly more corrupt than we first thought back during the Phil Fish investigation.
493840	498160	And there are ongoing investigations into the IGF's conduct, but they deserve their
498160	499160	own video.
499160	503440	I'll end it off with a message to any and all developers of any size who are listening.
503440	505420	Two narratives have been presented here.
505420	509520	The first is that the IGDA is the hammer that UBM wields against you.
509520	514060	The second is that the IGDA is kept down by the cabal just as much as you.
514060	517100	Only you know which is the truth, and I encourage you to speak out.
517100	521300	But regardless of which is true, is this the game dev that you dreamed about joining as
521300	522300	a kid?
522300	527300	Did you lie awake at night, thinking not about how awesome your game idea was, but about
527300	532140	how best to pander to self-important personalities who hold sway in your industry?
532140	536260	Did you enter the IGF, only to be told that your game was good and too bad it's not
536260	539540	going to win, or that somebody's boyfriend was going to win and that was that?
539540	544160	Do you actually want a game developer's union willing to stand for your interests?
544160	545580	You have to speak out.
545580	548140	This is as much our fight as it is yours now.
548140	552580	If what's happened to Mark Kern recently is any indication, the cabal is beginning
552580	555500	to turn on game devs who speak out against corruption.
555500	559240	It's not just gamers they're gunning for now, you are their next target.
559240	565120	When gamers contradicted their narrative, we repainted harassers, misogynists, and terrorists,
565120	567680	all for doing some computer chair investigation.
567680	572160	What do you think they're going to do to you, game devs, with your actual insider knowledge
572160	574640	on how they're gaming the system to their advantage?
574640	579160	I know you love this industry, but unless you speak out about the corruption you've
579160	584560	seen, there's not going to be an industry left to love.
584560	588560	You're actually not even nominated for anything, we want you to hand the awards to other people.
589560	595400	Great, I said, and then I immediately set to work planning my revenge video where I
595400	601160	discredited the awards and exposed all the conspiracies that caused me not to win.
601160	606160	I decided tonight I will not be making any jokes about gamergate.
606160	608480	All of tonight's gamergate jokes will be made by this sock puppet.
