WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.520
Hey guys, Dev here.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.820
I hope everyone is having a great time at this year's Game Developer Conference.

00:18.820 --> 00:21.680
I know Gamergate did, at least with the GDC hashtags.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.280
And because we over at the Sharp Play Otaku channel are opportunistic twats, I'd like

00:25.280 --> 00:27.720
to talk to you about something related to the GDC.

00:27.720 --> 00:30.760
Namely, the International Game Developers Association.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.480
Here is a brief history taken from the IGDA's own website.

00:34.480 --> 00:40.100
The IGDA was initially established in 1994 by Ernest Adams as the CGDA, the Computer

00:40.100 --> 00:41.760
Game Developers Association.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.480
Its main reason for being was to give game developers a unified voice in the wake of

00:45.480 --> 00:48.780
the video game debates happening in the American Congress that same year.

00:48.780 --> 00:52.800
In the Escapist's article on the subject, titled Let's Get Together, Adams describes

00:52.800 --> 00:54.440
the founding in greater detail.

00:54.640 --> 00:59.500
According to his own words, Adams went to the CGDC board and asked them to let him create

00:59.500 --> 01:04.520
the CGDA as a department of the conference itself, an association within the business.

01:04.520 --> 01:09.440
The CGDC he's referring to is the Computer Game Developer Conference, which would later

01:09.440 --> 01:11.280
become today's GDC.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.120
The IGDA began as a division of the GDC, back when the GDC was his own company.

01:16.120 --> 01:20.880
In 1995, the IGDA's predecessor became an independent organization, even though its

01:20.880 --> 01:23.880
members and staff were still the members and staff of the GDC.

01:23.880 --> 01:29.120
Adams says the IGDA's primary function was, and is, to support the careers and interests

01:29.120 --> 01:31.820
of developers as individuals, not companies.

01:31.820 --> 01:35.680
Which is a fine goal, but I'm not convinced the IGDA actually has game developers' best

01:35.680 --> 01:36.680
interests at heart.

01:36.680 --> 01:43.200
Around the same time as the IGDA's birth, the CGDC was sold to UBM, and became the GDC

01:43.200 --> 01:44.360
we know and love today.

01:44.360 --> 01:48.280
UBM is the parent company of Indie Games Fest, which I've already talked about at length

01:48.280 --> 01:52.760
in another video, and Gamasutra, one of the corrupt publications that Gamergate is boycotting.

01:52.760 --> 01:58.280
Officially, the IGDA did become its own separate entity from the GDC, or any other UBM-owned

01:58.280 --> 02:00.720
properties, but on paper it didn't quite work that way.

02:00.720 --> 02:07.280
The IGDA employed CMP for operations and management services up until 2004, CMP being what UBM

02:07.280 --> 02:09.000
called itself before a name change.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.200
Even after 2004, there continues to be significant crossover between the two organizations.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.720
Now let's take a step back and look at the whole picture.

02:15.720 --> 02:20.760
The IGDA is an association that brings developers together to have a unified political voice,

02:20.760 --> 02:24.600
to have them collaborate and push each other's work, and to stand up for their own collective

02:24.600 --> 02:25.600
interests.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.960
It's almost like a union, however not really, although an anonymous indie dev who spoke

02:29.960 --> 02:35.080
to us expressed the hope that it one day would grow into a full-fledged union for game devs,

02:35.080 --> 02:36.080
but more on that later.

02:36.080 --> 02:42.160
Now, the IGDA sprung up from the same roots as the GDC, and was owned for a time by UBM,

02:42.160 --> 02:44.720
and still has significant membership and staff crossover.

02:44.720 --> 02:48.160
This is what is known as, in other industries, creating a cabal.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.320
Suppose you were a small developer starting out.

02:50.320 --> 02:53.320
Do you want to have a fair shot at your game winning in the IGF?

02:53.320 --> 02:55.660
Do you want to have your work covered by Gamasutra?

02:55.660 --> 02:57.280
Do you want to show off your game at GDC?

02:57.280 --> 03:01.440
Well, if so, you're going to have to join this developers association, which claims

03:01.440 --> 03:05.560
to speak for your rights, but is financially and socially intertwined with the parent company

03:05.560 --> 03:07.540
of all these other events and outlets.

03:07.540 --> 03:12.400
The IGDA and UBM have essentially created a gateway to enter the gaming industry.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.840
The message they've sent to indie devs is clear.

03:14.840 --> 03:18.800
If you want to be a part of this industry, fall in line with us.

03:18.800 --> 03:22.680
It's blatantly unethical for award shows, journalism publications, and public conferences

03:22.680 --> 03:26.440
to have these ties with a union-like association that claims to represent the interests of

03:26.440 --> 03:28.360
its members in an unbiased manner.

03:28.360 --> 03:32.440
Not only is there no guarantee that the association won't pander to the interests of its corporate

03:32.440 --> 03:36.800
buddies rather than its members, there is also the obvious avenues for favoritism towards

03:36.800 --> 03:40.320
members over non-members at these supposedly fair events.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.640
This would be like if you worked in a factory, and the union that represents you was originally

03:43.640 --> 03:47.560
owned by the same parent company as the factory, and the union's staff were all the same

03:47.560 --> 03:48.960
people that ran the factory.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.620
Do you think you would be fairly represented in a dispute?

03:51.620 --> 03:54.000
And we can't forget the whole blockbot debacle.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.400
People opposed to gamer gits investigations into their unethical practices, and who wanted

03:57.400 --> 04:01.500
to push a narrative of harassment over the truth of corruption, created a blockbot.

04:01.500 --> 04:06.480
The public face of what would become known as the GG autoblocker was Randy Harper, but

04:06.480 --> 04:08.160
its creation involved a lot of people.

04:08.160 --> 04:13.280
GG autoblocker, when used, would automatically block a list of users on Twitter who were

04:13.320 --> 04:16.120
determined to have been pro-gamergate and therefore anti-corruption.

04:16.120 --> 04:21.440
However, GG autoblocker only became relevant when the IGDA began using it, and in doing

04:21.440 --> 04:26.600
so, began to block indie devs who had spoken out against corruption, including its own members.

04:26.600 --> 04:32.240
The IGDA publicly endorsed the blockbot, even as its own Puerto Rico chairman, Roberto Rosario,

04:32.240 --> 04:36.560
was blocked by it for his objection to Jordy Tate's comment that all gamergaters be sent

04:36.560 --> 04:38.440
to Nazi gas chambers.

04:38.440 --> 04:42.540
In retaliation, the Puerto Rico chapter of the IGDA was closed.

04:42.540 --> 04:47.380
The shitstorm that descended upon the IGDA by its own blocked members was colossal.

04:47.380 --> 04:52.940
What didn't help is that the list that the GG autoblocker used was distinctly called

04:52.940 --> 04:57.240
the blacklist, and that companies colluding to blacklist individuals from the industry

04:57.240 --> 04:59.140
is illegal under US law.

04:59.140 --> 05:04.060
The IGDA quickly backpedaled, with the current chair, Kate Edwards, saying that the blacklist

05:04.060 --> 05:08.540
bot was a third-party tool, that they weren't involved in its construction, and that the

05:08.540 --> 05:10.620
IGDA will stop using it.

05:10.620 --> 05:12.140
Except that none of it was true.

05:12.140 --> 05:16.740
One day before Edwards' denial of involvement on Twitter, Donna Prior said that a bunch

05:16.740 --> 05:22.820
of people had their fingers in the blacklist bot, with WIG taking the major load of work.

05:22.820 --> 05:28.820
WIG is the IGDA's women's games group, and Donna Prior works for the IGDA in several

05:28.820 --> 05:29.860
capacities.

05:29.860 --> 05:32.220
And despite what they've said, the IGDA still uses it.

05:32.220 --> 05:36.740
Camera ladies never spoke to Kate Edwards before, and yet here she is, blocked.

05:36.740 --> 05:40.960
Not only does the IGDA endorse the blacklist bot, it's no third-party tool.

05:40.960 --> 05:45.760
It was created by a division of the IGDA to block its own members who speak out about

05:45.760 --> 05:49.360
corruption, and they continue to use it to this day despite the lies they told to get

05:49.360 --> 05:51.080
indie devs off their back.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.600
Now here's where things begin to get really interesting.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.160
A number of indie devs have actually been willing to speak with camera lady on this

05:57.160 --> 05:58.160
topic.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.640
Some were entirely okay with going public, while others wanted their names censored out

06:01.640 --> 06:04.280
of fear of reprisal from the IGDA.

06:04.280 --> 06:08.760
Pixelmetal, the dev of the indie game Sombrero, said that most indies are wary of pissing

06:08.760 --> 06:13.560
off the IGDA, due to the collaborations and promotions the IGDA provides.

06:13.560 --> 06:19.080
Many people simply aren't willing to talk about the IGDA, the IGF, GDC, or Gamasutra

06:19.080 --> 06:20.840
due to the Cabal's influence.

06:20.840 --> 06:25.000
Another person camera lady spoke to about the IGDA and its unethical links to UBM's

06:25.000 --> 06:29.200
properties, who never specified about whether or not he wanted to remain anonymous, so we've

06:29.200 --> 06:34.240
erred on the side of caution and censored him just in case, said Silverstring, Lego

06:34.240 --> 06:36.280
Butts, Ismail, Shafer.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.920
All their relationships and collaboration.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.320
Quinn got caught out by being a manipulative asshole.

06:40.320 --> 06:44.580
But as a game dev, it became apparent that there was a definite web of cool kids.

06:44.580 --> 06:49.040
Many with no actual game dev skills, just loudly supporting causes.

06:49.040 --> 06:53.400
They trick new game devs into thinking they're the top, but they're simply the loudest.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.180
The real game devs are mostly too busy working.

06:56.180 --> 07:00.460
The anonymous indie dev from earlier, who hoped the IGDA would eventually reform and

07:00.460 --> 07:05.200
become a full-fledged union, has a different opinion on the IGDA than everyone else.

07:05.200 --> 07:10.240
Thus far, evidence points towards UBM and the IGDA working together to create a gateway

07:10.240 --> 07:15.560
into the gaming industry, with the IGDA acting as UBM's enforcement arm to keep questioning

07:15.560 --> 07:16.920
developers in line.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.560
However, this individual paints a different light.

07:19.560 --> 07:24.280
They say that the IGDA doesn't act as UBM's muscle, but rather it is intimidated itself

07:24.280 --> 07:27.800
by UBM, just as much as individual developers are.

07:27.800 --> 07:32.000
The IGDA itself is a very fickle organization that tends to go whichever way the wind is

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
blowing.

07:33.240 --> 07:36.280
Right now, UBM asserts the most pressure, so it sides with them.

07:36.280 --> 07:40.920
However, the potential is there for the IGDA to become an ally of ethics in our industry

07:40.920 --> 07:43.440
if UBM's stranglehold on them is broken.

07:43.440 --> 07:47.440
Now this analysis of events is just as plausible as the more commonly held viewpoint that the

07:47.440 --> 07:50.080
IGDA is complicit in the suppression of developers.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.520
But at this point, the question must be asked.

07:52.520 --> 07:57.520
If the IGDA is not the tool that UBM uses to enforce order on developers, then what

07:57.520 --> 07:58.520
is?

07:58.560 --> 08:03.000
The autonomous dev says that UBM directly strongarms devs who step out of line with

08:03.000 --> 08:08.800
general social engineering, but also GDC access, gamasutra coverage, and the IGF, making the

08:08.800 --> 08:13.840
IGF significantly more corrupt than we first thought back during the Phil Fish investigation.

08:13.840 --> 08:18.160
And there are ongoing investigations into the IGF's conduct, but they deserve their

08:18.160 --> 08:19.160
own video.

08:19.160 --> 08:23.440
I'll end it off with a message to any and all developers of any size who are listening.

08:23.440 --> 08:25.420
Two narratives have been presented here.

08:25.420 --> 08:29.520
The first is that the IGDA is the hammer that UBM wields against you.

08:29.520 --> 08:34.060
The second is that the IGDA is kept down by the cabal just as much as you.

08:34.060 --> 08:37.100
Only you know which is the truth, and I encourage you to speak out.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.300
But regardless of which is true, is this the game dev that you dreamed about joining as

08:41.300 --> 08:42.300
a kid?

08:42.300 --> 08:47.300
Did you lie awake at night, thinking not about how awesome your game idea was, but about

08:47.300 --> 08:52.140
how best to pander to self-important personalities who hold sway in your industry?

08:52.140 --> 08:56.260
Did you enter the IGF, only to be told that your game was good and too bad it's not

08:56.260 --> 08:59.540
going to win, or that somebody's boyfriend was going to win and that was that?

08:59.540 --> 09:04.160
Do you actually want a game developer's union willing to stand for your interests?

09:04.160 --> 09:05.580
You have to speak out.

09:05.580 --> 09:08.140
This is as much our fight as it is yours now.

09:08.140 --> 09:12.580
If what's happened to Mark Kern recently is any indication, the cabal is beginning

09:12.580 --> 09:15.500
to turn on game devs who speak out against corruption.

09:15.500 --> 09:19.240
It's not just gamers they're gunning for now, you are their next target.

09:19.240 --> 09:25.120
When gamers contradicted their narrative, we repainted harassers, misogynists, and terrorists,

09:25.120 --> 09:27.680
all for doing some computer chair investigation.

09:27.680 --> 09:32.160
What do you think they're going to do to you, game devs, with your actual insider knowledge

09:32.160 --> 09:34.640
on how they're gaming the system to their advantage?

09:34.640 --> 09:39.160
I know you love this industry, but unless you speak out about the corruption you've

09:39.160 --> 09:44.560
seen, there's not going to be an industry left to love.

09:44.560 --> 09:48.560
You're actually not even nominated for anything, we want you to hand the awards to other people.

09:49.560 --> 09:55.400
Great, I said, and then I immediately set to work planning my revenge video where I

09:55.400 --> 10:01.160
discredited the awards and exposed all the conspiracies that caused me not to win.

10:01.160 --> 10:06.160
I decided tonight I will not be making any jokes about gamergate.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.480
All of tonight's gamergate jokes will be made by this sock puppet.
