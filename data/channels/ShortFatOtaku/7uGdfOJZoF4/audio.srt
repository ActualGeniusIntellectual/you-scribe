1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,520
Hey guys, Dev here.

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,820
I hope everyone is having a great time at this year's Game Developer Conference.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,680
I know Gamergate did, at least with the GDC hashtags.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,280
And because we over at the Sharp Play Otaku channel are opportunistic twats, I'd like

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,720
to talk to you about something related to the GDC.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,760
Namely, the International Game Developers Association.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,480
Here is a brief history taken from the IGDA's own website.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,100
The IGDA was initially established in 1994 by Ernest Adams as the CGDA, the Computer

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,760
Game Developers Association.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,480
Its main reason for being was to give game developers a unified voice in the wake of

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,780
the video game debates happening in the American Congress that same year.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,800
In the Escapist's article on the subject, titled Let's Get Together, Adams describes

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,440
the founding in greater detail.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,500
According to his own words, Adams went to the CGDC board and asked them to let him create

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,520
the CGDA as a department of the conference itself, an association within the business.

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,440
The CGDC he's referring to is the Computer Game Developer Conference, which would later

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,280
become today's GDC.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,120
The IGDA began as a division of the GDC, back when the GDC was his own company.

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,880
In 1995, the IGDA's predecessor became an independent organization, even though its

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,880
members and staff were still the members and staff of the GDC.

21
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,120
Adams says the IGDA's primary function was, and is, to support the careers and interests

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,820
of developers as individuals, not companies.

23
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,680
Which is a fine goal, but I'm not convinced the IGDA actually has game developers' best

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
interests at heart.

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,200
Around the same time as the IGDA's birth, the CGDC was sold to UBM, and became the GDC

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,360
we know and love today.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,280
UBM is the parent company of Indie Games Fest, which I've already talked about at length

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,760
in another video, and Gamasutra, one of the corrupt publications that Gamergate is boycotting.

29
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,280
Officially, the IGDA did become its own separate entity from the GDC, or any other UBM-owned

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,720
properties, but on paper it didn't quite work that way.

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,280
The IGDA employed CMP for operations and management services up until 2004, CMP being what UBM

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,000
called itself before a name change.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,200
Even after 2004, there continues to be significant crossover between the two organizations.

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,720
Now let's take a step back and look at the whole picture.

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,760
The IGDA is an association that brings developers together to have a unified political voice,

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,600
to have them collaborate and push each other's work, and to stand up for their own collective

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
interests.

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,960
It's almost like a union, however not really, although an anonymous indie dev who spoke

39
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,080
to us expressed the hope that it one day would grow into a full-fledged union for game devs,

40
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
but more on that later.

41
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,160
Now, the IGDA sprung up from the same roots as the GDC, and was owned for a time by UBM,

42
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,720
and still has significant membership and staff crossover.

43
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,160
This is what is known as, in other industries, creating a cabal.

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,320
Suppose you were a small developer starting out.

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Do you want to have a fair shot at your game winning in the IGF?

46
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,660
Do you want to have your work covered by Gamasutra?

47
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,280
Do you want to show off your game at GDC?

48
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,440
Well, if so, you're going to have to join this developers association, which claims

49
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,560
to speak for your rights, but is financially and socially intertwined with the parent company

50
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,540
of all these other events and outlets.

51
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,400
The IGDA and UBM have essentially created a gateway to enter the gaming industry.

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,840
The message they've sent to indie devs is clear.

53
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,800
If you want to be a part of this industry, fall in line with us.

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,680
It's blatantly unethical for award shows, journalism publications, and public conferences

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,440
to have these ties with a union-like association that claims to represent the interests of

56
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,360
its members in an unbiased manner.

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,440
Not only is there no guarantee that the association won't pander to the interests of its corporate

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,800
buddies rather than its members, there is also the obvious avenues for favoritism towards

59
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,320
members over non-members at these supposedly fair events.

60
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,640
This would be like if you worked in a factory, and the union that represents you was originally

61
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,560
owned by the same parent company as the factory, and the union's staff were all the same

62
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,960
people that ran the factory.

63
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,620
Do you think you would be fairly represented in a dispute?

64
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,000
And we can't forget the whole blockbot debacle.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,400
People opposed to gamer gits investigations into their unethical practices, and who wanted

66
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,500
to push a narrative of harassment over the truth of corruption, created a blockbot.

67
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,480
The public face of what would become known as the GG autoblocker was Randy Harper, but

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,160
its creation involved a lot of people.

69
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,280
GG autoblocker, when used, would automatically block a list of users on Twitter who were

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,120
determined to have been pro-gamergate and therefore anti-corruption.

71
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,440
However, GG autoblocker only became relevant when the IGDA began using it, and in doing

72
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,600
so, began to block indie devs who had spoken out against corruption, including its own members.

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,240
The IGDA publicly endorsed the blockbot, even as its own Puerto Rico chairman, Roberto Rosario,

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,560
was blocked by it for his objection to Jordy Tate's comment that all gamergaters be sent

75
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,440
to Nazi gas chambers.

76
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,540
In retaliation, the Puerto Rico chapter of the IGDA was closed.

77
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,380
The shitstorm that descended upon the IGDA by its own blocked members was colossal.

78
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,940
What didn't help is that the list that the GG autoblocker used was distinctly called

79
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,240
the blacklist, and that companies colluding to blacklist individuals from the industry

80
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,140
is illegal under US law.

81
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,060
The IGDA quickly backpedaled, with the current chair, Kate Edwards, saying that the blacklist

82
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,540
bot was a third-party tool, that they weren't involved in its construction, and that the

83
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,620
IGDA will stop using it.

84
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,140
Except that none of it was true.

85
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,740
One day before Edwards' denial of involvement on Twitter, Donna Prior said that a bunch

86
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,820
of people had their fingers in the blacklist bot, with WIG taking the major load of work.

87
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:28,820
WIG is the IGDA's women's games group, and Donna Prior works for the IGDA in several

88
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,860
capacities.

89
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,220
And despite what they've said, the IGDA still uses it.

90
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,740
Camera ladies never spoke to Kate Edwards before, and yet here she is, blocked.

91
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,960
Not only does the IGDA endorse the blacklist bot, it's no third-party tool.

92
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,760
It was created by a division of the IGDA to block its own members who speak out about

93
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,360
corruption, and they continue to use it to this day despite the lies they told to get

94
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,080
indie devs off their back.

95
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,600
Now here's where things begin to get really interesting.

96
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,160
A number of indie devs have actually been willing to speak with camera lady on this

97
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
topic.

98
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,640
Some were entirely okay with going public, while others wanted their names censored out

99
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,280
of fear of reprisal from the IGDA.

100
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,760
Pixelmetal, the dev of the indie game Sombrero, said that most indies are wary of pissing

101
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,560
off the IGDA, due to the collaborations and promotions the IGDA provides.

102
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,080
Many people simply aren't willing to talk about the IGDA, the IGF, GDC, or Gamasutra

103
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,840
due to the Cabal's influence.

104
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,000
Another person camera lady spoke to about the IGDA and its unethical links to UBM's

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,200
properties, who never specified about whether or not he wanted to remain anonymous, so we've

106
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,240
erred on the side of caution and censored him just in case, said Silverstring, Lego

107
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,280
Butts, Ismail, Shafer.

108
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,920
All their relationships and collaboration.

109
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,320
Quinn got caught out by being a manipulative asshole.

110
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,580
But as a game dev, it became apparent that there was a definite web of cool kids.

111
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,040
Many with no actual game dev skills, just loudly supporting causes.

112
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,400
They trick new game devs into thinking they're the top, but they're simply the loudest.

113
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,180
The real game devs are mostly too busy working.

114
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,460
The anonymous indie dev from earlier, who hoped the IGDA would eventually reform and

115
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,200
become a full-fledged union, has a different opinion on the IGDA than everyone else.

116
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,240
Thus far, evidence points towards UBM and the IGDA working together to create a gateway

117
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,560
into the gaming industry, with the IGDA acting as UBM's enforcement arm to keep questioning

118
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,920
developers in line.

119
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,560
However, this individual paints a different light.

120
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,280
They say that the IGDA doesn't act as UBM's muscle, but rather it is intimidated itself

121
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,800
by UBM, just as much as individual developers are.

122
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,000
The IGDA itself is a very fickle organization that tends to go whichever way the wind is

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
blowing.

124
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,280
Right now, UBM asserts the most pressure, so it sides with them.

125
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,920
However, the potential is there for the IGDA to become an ally of ethics in our industry

126
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,440
if UBM's stranglehold on them is broken.

127
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Now this analysis of events is just as plausible as the more commonly held viewpoint that the

128
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,080
IGDA is complicit in the suppression of developers.

129
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,520
But at this point, the question must be asked.

130
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,520
If the IGDA is not the tool that UBM uses to enforce order on developers, then what

131
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
is?

132
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,000
The autonomous dev says that UBM directly strongarms devs who step out of line with

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,800
general social engineering, but also GDC access, gamasutra coverage, and the IGF, making the

134
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,840
IGF significantly more corrupt than we first thought back during the Phil Fish investigation.

135
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,160
And there are ongoing investigations into the IGF's conduct, but they deserve their

136
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
own video.

137
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,440
I'll end it off with a message to any and all developers of any size who are listening.

138
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,420
Two narratives have been presented here.

139
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,520
The first is that the IGDA is the hammer that UBM wields against you.

140
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,060
The second is that the IGDA is kept down by the cabal just as much as you.

141
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,100
Only you know which is the truth, and I encourage you to speak out.

142
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,300
But regardless of which is true, is this the game dev that you dreamed about joining as

143
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,300
a kid?

144
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,300
Did you lie awake at night, thinking not about how awesome your game idea was, but about

145
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,140
how best to pander to self-important personalities who hold sway in your industry?

146
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,260
Did you enter the IGF, only to be told that your game was good and too bad it's not

147
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,540
going to win, or that somebody's boyfriend was going to win and that was that?

148
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,160
Do you actually want a game developer's union willing to stand for your interests?

149
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,580
You have to speak out.

150
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,140
This is as much our fight as it is yours now.

151
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,580
If what's happened to Mark Kern recently is any indication, the cabal is beginning

152
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,500
to turn on game devs who speak out against corruption.

153
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,240
It's not just gamers they're gunning for now, you are their next target.

154
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,120
When gamers contradicted their narrative, we repainted harassers, misogynists, and terrorists,

155
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,680
all for doing some computer chair investigation.

156
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,160
What do you think they're going to do to you, game devs, with your actual insider knowledge

157
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,640
on how they're gaming the system to their advantage?

158
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,160
I know you love this industry, but unless you speak out about the corruption you've

159
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,560
seen, there's not going to be an industry left to love.

160
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,560
You're actually not even nominated for anything, we want you to hand the awards to other people.

161
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,400

162
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:01,160
discredited the awards and exposed all the conspiracies that caused me not to win.

163
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,160
I decided tonight I will not be making any jokes about gamergate.

164
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,480
All of tonight's gamergate jokes will be made by this sock puppet.
