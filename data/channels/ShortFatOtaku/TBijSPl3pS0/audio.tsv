0	2000	I
5400	11680	Just finished watching one of these most recent videos and in it he said something very interesting. So let's watch together
11680	15080	I just finished watching short fat otaku's latest video and
15600	21040	In it, he played the clip of wash that I found to be very interesting. So let's watch it together
21600	24640	Call it selling out your principles. I call it winning and
25640	32720	And that's my principle to win as a socialist not to lose as a socialist
32720	34880	Hey funny how that all turns out
34880	40400	I wonder how many times I can layer the parasite Eve background music before it becomes unrecognizable
40400	46600	But the part of these video that got me thinking was when he described how if you're a known liar and suddenly need other people
46600	48080	To believe you you're pretty much screwed
48080	55800	He mentioned a few examples like how British and German pilots during the Second World War would refrain from shooting enemies who were parachuting down
55800	62800	From a damaged plane as an unwritten sign of respect while when Soviet pilots took no such mercy the Germans stopped doing it with them
62800	67540	He also mentioned the tranquil monk who is capable of fighting but would never be the one to throw the first punch
67540	72800	Well, I was watching this video. I started thinking about a conversation. I had a few months ago with a particularly recalcitrant
73280	78120	He's been banned oh wait, he's he's a punished variant now the tweets are gone though
78120	80760	It doesn't matter because if you hung around progressives for any amount of time
80760	83840	You'll understand the argument even without being able to see it the position
83840	87160	This guy held is that people's lives are obviously worth more than property
87160	89440	So when a burglar breaks into your house to steal your stuff
89440	92400	You don't have the right to use force on him in defense of your property
92400	97300	In fact, it's murder if you do because theft of property is not so horrible as killing somebody
97300	101380	I've noticed that when dealing with progressive ethics, the problem isn't that they're wrong
101740	104460	Obviously somebody's life is worth more than an animate object
104460	110300	The problem is that they reach a shallow conclusion that fits their politics and then they stop thinking they don't continue to dig for the
110300	114140	Real answer you can find progressives all over the internet exposing this position
114140	119420	What's more important is the reply given by me and others to his nonsense the general consensus is
119620	125460	Defending your family from an unknown intruder is more important than calling the police and huddling in a corner like a cuck waiting for them
125460	126300	to arrive or
126300	132540	Alternatively trying to do an accurate threat assessment and de-escalate the situation as he pulls out a gun and puts a bullet in your stupid
132540	138340	Ass when you don't know what he's there to do the worst-case scenario isn't that you're measuring your property against his life
138340	143540	It's that you're measuring the lives of everybody else in the house against his and in that case the choice becomes clear
143540	148520	But because commies like to lionize poor burglars as being victims of the system which to be fair
148520	155340	They sometimes are the burglars actions have to be inherently morally virtuous and therefore you must be in the wrong to protect your stuff
155340	157860	So let's give the progressive the benefit of the doubt
157940	162980	Let's say that the home intruder is absolutely only there to steal your stuff and let's say somehow
163100	168460	You know this are you still justified in using force to stop him even if that means he might end up dead
168460	172820	I remember when I was a child and I first learned about Gandhi and his nonviolent resistance
172820	177720	How he managed to expel the British from India and secure his country's freedom using nonviolent methods
177720	181000	I remember as a kid how heroic that sounded it sounded virtuous
181440	186720	High-minded that his people would allow themselves to be struck down by their occupiers until they couldn't stand to do it anymore
186720	190280	It still sounds miraculous even as an adult but obviously less
190280	195480	So do you think if India were occupied by Nazis or Soviets Gandhi's tactics would have worked?
195520	202560	Of course not those tactics relied on the basic human decency of the British the Nazis and Soviets would have literally just killed them all
202560	204300	Until there was not a single Indian left
204300	209480	I ended up losing a lot of respect for Gandhi as I got older because the only thing we can truly learn from his story
209480	214760	Is that violence is bad and sure but that doesn't tell us when it's appropriate or not to use it
214760	218120	That's a much harder question and Gandhi's answer was to ignore it
218120	225200	It's the difference between Chamberlain's appeasement of Germany and Churchill's willingness to fight them that plus when he started launching nukes and civilization
225200	230920	I figured Gandhi's day was over the answer to that question that our progressive friend here provides with his corn kernel brain
230920	234040	Is that you should never risk anybody's life except to save other lives
234520	239460	No violence unless in response to somebody else's violence and it sounds good when you say it like that
239460	243000	It provokes a righteous moral response on the surface of your personality
243000	247920	You can feel really good about and pat yourself in the back and say look how much more civilized I am than these plebs
247920	250840	But it's not deep enough. It's not right enough
250840	255220	There's more thinking to do than simply what feels good and gets you Twitter likes from your friends
255240	258520	Let's say a police officer sees somebody breaking into a house through a window
258520	261800	The officer should stop the thief with as much force as is required
261920	268480	Even if he might get killed even if the thief is only stealing jewelry and not actually hurting anybody because if nobody ever so much
268480	274000	As inconveniences the thieves there will simply be more thieves and the fabric of society breaks down
274000	280720	It becomes a far worse world to live in where you can't trust your fellow man or the institutions meant to protect you or the possibility
280720	282080	That you could work hard and save for the future
282080	288000	If bad people are willing to risk violence to get what they want and good people always stand down because violence is bad
288040	294680	Then bad people always win this can be explained reasonably enough by game theory true to its name game theory is the study of
294920	302540	Strategic interactions between rational decision-makers in areas with set rules and values aka games its application ranges from biology to sociology
302680	308540	To math to computer science as it applies to animals to humans to artificial intelligence and even just to regular
308720	314820	Non-intelligent computer programs if something has a goal a pathway to get it and other agents with goals and pathways to contend with you can
314820	318260	Apply game theory the home defense situation is best modeled by Hawks and doves
318260	322980	I'll leave a link to a video by primer explaining it in detail how it works. You really should watch it
322980	325420	It's probably better than anything I've made on YouTube, but here's the basic idea
325420	330020	You've got a limited amount of food and you've got two creatures Hawks and doves Hawks fight doves
330020	332700	Don't when two does both attempt to get the same piece of food
332700	337340	They split so each dove gets half of the food when a dove and a hawk both attempt to get a piece of food
337340	342420	The Hawk bullies the dove so that the Hawk gets all the food and the dove gets none of it when two Hawks both attempt
342420	345780	To get the same piece of food they fight over it fighting incurs a cost
345780	351260	So they each get half of the food minus the cost we can sort the interactions like this Hawk and Hawk
351260	354760	They each get food divided by two minus cost dove and dove
354760	359540	They each get food divided by two Hawk and dove the Hawk gets all the food the dove gets nothing
359540	361460	So if these are the rules of the game
361460	363700	What should you play as a hawk or a dove?
363700	368180	You might be tempted to choose dove because you're a pacifist cuck or Hawk because you're a Chad
368180	371420	But the most optimum strategy actually depends on what either players are playing
371420	373980	For example, if it's just you and I and I choose dove
373980	378420	You're better off choosing Hawk because then you can take everything from me every time we encounter each other
378420	384060	But if I'm playing a hawk then it depends if the cost of fighting is high enough that food divided by two
384220	386100	Minus cost is lower than zero
386100	392100	You're actually better off playing a dove because if I'm a hawk when we encounter each other you'll end up in a better position as
392100	396020	A dove instead of a hawk and we can keep tweaking these variables to see what kind of hypothetical
396300	398700	Society of Hawks and doves we get for example
398700	402540	If there's no cost of fighting at all Hawks will always drive doves to extinction
402860	408700	Inversely if there's an extremely high cost to Hawks fighting each other higher than having the food stolen from you as a dove then doves will
408700	413460	Drive the Hawks to extinction or rather the Hawks will destroy themselves and the doves will move into the space left behind
413460	418880	but what you'll find is no matter how you adjust the variables the population of Hawks and doves will always eventually reach an
418980	423660	Equilibrium where the population will sustain itself based on how advantageous it is to either fight or cooperate
423860	426620	The real world is obviously a lot more complicated than this
426620	431460	But the game of Hawks and doves can be applied to any social interaction where there is risk and reward
431780	437700	Associated with both fight and flight and the lesson we can take away is if a society is set up such that theft is more
437740	444380	Profitable than reaction to theft is detrimental then that society will be overrun by thieves and in case you think I'm just babbling a whole bunch
444380	446660	Of theory out my ass and that has no application in the real world
446660	450620	We are already seeing this play out in real time back in 2014
451020	453520	California reclassified shoplifting valued at
454160	456940	$950 or less from a felony to a misdemeanor and
457540	464860	Unsurprisingly shoplifting has increased videos routinely go viral of people stealing just under that amount knowing that security guards won't stop them
464860	471740	Cops won't be called and if the cops are called a misdemeanor isn't exactly high priority if a society makes the punishment for stealing this
471740	474200	Low if it's more profitable to steal than to work
474260	479540	Honestly people will steal and if enough people are stealing and not working then they're not producing
479820	486980	Meaning that there's nothing left to steal and eventually society collapses the counter-argument to this is that society can sometimes make theft too
487060	491380	Punishing or innocence can get swept up in the hysteria of crime fighting and that can happen
491380	496060	But firstly that's no reason to swing across to the other extreme to say theft is good
496140	500900	Actually, especially from the crowd that says that employment and profit are theft and secondly
501020	506580	It's been my experience that radicals of all types progressive and reactionary left and right doesn't matter
506580	512060	They completely forget about the existence of the golden mean yes a society that is too strict is bad
512060	518720	But so is a society that's too lax when a libertarian says government regulation makes everything worse in all possible
519120	525820	Situations and the socialist says that the free market leads to ruin in all possible situations. They're both making the same mistake
525940	530860	They're ignoring the golden mean government can ruin things the free market can ruin things, too
530860	535260	But it doesn't necessarily have to be that way and the same goes for theft and law enforcement
535700	540700	All of this being said if you wake up in the middle of the night and hear a burglar prowling around
540700	543100	You're probably not thinking any of this extended political stuff
543100	546940	You're probably thinking about how to defend your family, which means you're thinking about game theory
546940	547940	Even if you don't know it
547940	553780	You don't know if the burglar is a hawk or a dove so your response will be based on the cost of fighting if the burglar
553780	559300	Is a dove and regardless of the cost of fighting you should be a hawk because if you fight the burglar will give up or run
559300	563940	Away, if the burglar is a hawk then suddenly it becomes unknown what you should do if you're a dove
563940	566820	Will the burglar just take your stuff and leave or will he kill you?
566820	571300	Will he kill everybody else in the house? If you're a hawk, what will be the cost of fighting with another hawk?
571300	573300	It's all entirely unknown
573300	578220	But one thing becomes clear the possibility of losing everything not just your stuff
578220	581620	But your life your family's life if you choose to play as a dove is
581700	587220	On the table if the cost of playing as a dove versus a hawk is higher than the maximum possible
587260	593340	Cost of two hawks fighting then regardless of the damage you both might do being a hawk is always the better choice
593620	596820	In other words in a room full of doves hawks to stabilize things
596820	603380	But in a room full of hawks being a hawk is your only shot at survival and in a room full of unknowns in almost every
603460	606940	Situation it's better to be a hawk progressives. Just don't think this way
606940	610180	They say what sounds good and moral and will get their friends to accept them
610180	613580	But they don't really go beyond that and you know what I can make a good solid
613660	617980	Moral argument for home defense to people in the house depend on me and defending them is more important
617980	622340	My property represents the labor I perform to build or buy it making me a slave you steal it from me
622340	627220	But I don't even need to appeal to morality to refute the progressive position even in the most rational
628020	634420	Scientific materialist view of things which I'm sure the Prague will appreciate more than something like honor as long as you have others depending on
634420	636620	You whose lives mean more to you than your own
636620	641740	It will always be more worth it to defend them than to risk them the mindset of the person who thinks otherwise
641740	646820	Seems to be the mindset of the person who doesn't have anybody that they view as worth defending
