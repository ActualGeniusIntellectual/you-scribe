1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,680
Just finished watching one of these most recent videos and in it he said something very interesting. So let's watch together

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,080
I just finished watching short fat otaku's latest video and

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,040
In it, he played the clip of wash that I found to be very interesting. So let's watch it together

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,640
Call it selling out your principles. I call it winning and

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,720
And that's my principle to win as a socialist not to lose as a socialist

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,880
Hey funny how that all turns out

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,400
I wonder how many times I can layer the parasite Eve background music before it becomes unrecognizable

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,600
But the part of these video that got me thinking was when he described how if you're a known liar and suddenly need other people

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,080
To believe you you're pretty much screwed

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,800
He mentioned a few examples like how British and German pilots during the Second World War would refrain from shooting enemies who were parachuting down

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,800
From a damaged plane as an unwritten sign of respect while when Soviet pilots took no such mercy the Germans stopped doing it with them

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,540
He also mentioned the tranquil monk who is capable of fighting but would never be the one to throw the first punch

14
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,800
Well, I was watching this video. I started thinking about a conversation. I had a few months ago with a particularly recalcitrant

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,120
He's been banned oh wait, he's he's a punished variant now the tweets are gone though

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,760
It doesn't matter because if you hung around progressives for any amount of time

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,840
You'll understand the argument even without being able to see it the position

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,160
This guy held is that people's lives are obviously worth more than property

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,440
So when a burglar breaks into your house to steal your stuff

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,400
You don't have the right to use force on him in defense of your property

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,300
In fact, it's murder if you do because theft of property is not so horrible as killing somebody

22
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,380
I've noticed that when dealing with progressive ethics, the problem isn't that they're wrong

23
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,460
Obviously somebody's life is worth more than an animate object

24
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,300
The problem is that they reach a shallow conclusion that fits their politics and then they stop thinking they don't continue to dig for the

25
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,140
Real answer you can find progressives all over the internet exposing this position

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,420
What's more important is the reply given by me and others to his nonsense the general consensus is

27
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:05,460
Defending your family from an unknown intruder is more important than calling the police and huddling in a corner like a cuck waiting for them

28
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,300
to arrive or

29
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:12,540
Alternatively trying to do an accurate threat assessment and de-escalate the situation as he pulls out a gun and puts a bullet in your stupid

30
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,340
Ass when you don't know what he's there to do the worst-case scenario isn't that you're measuring your property against his life

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,540
It's that you're measuring the lives of everybody else in the house against his and in that case the choice becomes clear

32
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,520
But because commies like to lionize poor burglars as being victims of the system which to be fair

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:35,340
They sometimes are the burglars actions have to be inherently morally virtuous and therefore you must be in the wrong to protect your stuff

34
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,860
So let's give the progressive the benefit of the doubt

35
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,980
Let's say that the home intruder is absolutely only there to steal your stuff and let's say somehow

36
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,460
You know this are you still justified in using force to stop him even if that means he might end up dead

37
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,820
I remember when I was a child and I first learned about Gandhi and his nonviolent resistance

38
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,720
How he managed to expel the British from India and secure his country's freedom using nonviolent methods

39
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,000
I remember as a kid how heroic that sounded it sounded virtuous

40
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,720
High-minded that his people would allow themselves to be struck down by their occupiers until they couldn't stand to do it anymore

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,280
It still sounds miraculous even as an adult but obviously less

42
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,480
So do you think if India were occupied by Nazis or Soviets Gandhi's tactics would have worked?

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:22,560
Of course not those tactics relied on the basic human decency of the British the Nazis and Soviets would have literally just killed them all

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,300
Until there was not a single Indian left

45
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,480
I ended up losing a lot of respect for Gandhi as I got older because the only thing we can truly learn from his story

46
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,760
Is that violence is bad and sure but that doesn't tell us when it's appropriate or not to use it

47
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,120
That's a much harder question and Gandhi's answer was to ignore it

48
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,200
It's the difference between Chamberlain's appeasement of Germany and Churchill's willingness to fight them that plus when he started launching nukes and civilization

49
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,920
I figured Gandhi's day was over the answer to that question that our progressive friend here provides with his corn kernel brain

50
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,040
Is that you should never risk anybody's life except to save other lives

51
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,460
No violence unless in response to somebody else's violence and it sounds good when you say it like that

52
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,000
It provokes a righteous moral response on the surface of your personality

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,920
You can feel really good about and pat yourself in the back and say look how much more civilized I am than these plebs

54
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,840
But it's not deep enough. It's not right enough

55
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,220
There's more thinking to do than simply what feels good and gets you Twitter likes from your friends

56
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,520
Let's say a police officer sees somebody breaking into a house through a window

57
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,800
The officer should stop the thief with as much force as is required

58
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,480
Even if he might get killed even if the thief is only stealing jewelry and not actually hurting anybody because if nobody ever so much

59
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,000
As inconveniences the thieves there will simply be more thieves and the fabric of society breaks down

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,720
It becomes a far worse world to live in where you can't trust your fellow man or the institutions meant to protect you or the possibility

61
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,080
That you could work hard and save for the future

62
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,000
If bad people are willing to risk violence to get what they want and good people always stand down because violence is bad

63
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,680
Then bad people always win this can be explained reasonably enough by game theory true to its name game theory is the study of

64
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:02,540
Strategic interactions between rational decision-makers in areas with set rules and values aka games its application ranges from biology to sociology

65
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,540
To math to computer science as it applies to animals to humans to artificial intelligence and even just to regular

66
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,820
Non-intelligent computer programs if something has a goal a pathway to get it and other agents with goals and pathways to contend with you can

67
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,260
Apply game theory the home defense situation is best modeled by Hawks and doves

68
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,980
I'll leave a link to a video by primer explaining it in detail how it works. You really should watch it

69
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,420
It's probably better than anything I've made on YouTube, but here's the basic idea

70
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,020
You've got a limited amount of food and you've got two creatures Hawks and doves Hawks fight doves

71
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,700
Don't when two does both attempt to get the same piece of food

72
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,340
They split so each dove gets half of the food when a dove and a hawk both attempt to get a piece of food

73
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,420
The Hawk bullies the dove so that the Hawk gets all the food and the dove gets none of it when two Hawks both attempt

74
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,780
To get the same piece of food they fight over it fighting incurs a cost

75
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,260
So they each get half of the food minus the cost we can sort the interactions like this Hawk and Hawk

76
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,760
They each get food divided by two minus cost dove and dove

77
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,540
They each get food divided by two Hawk and dove the Hawk gets all the food the dove gets nothing

78
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,460
So if these are the rules of the game

79
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,700
What should you play as a hawk or a dove?

80
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,180
You might be tempted to choose dove because you're a pacifist cuck or Hawk because you're a Chad

81
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,420
But the most optimum strategy actually depends on what either players are playing

82
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,980
For example, if it's just you and I and I choose dove

83
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,420
You're better off choosing Hawk because then you can take everything from me every time we encounter each other

84
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:24,060
But if I'm playing a hawk then it depends if the cost of fighting is high enough that food divided by two

85
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,100
Minus cost is lower than zero

86
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,100
You're actually better off playing a dove because if I'm a hawk when we encounter each other you'll end up in a better position as

87
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,020
A dove instead of a hawk and we can keep tweaking these variables to see what kind of hypothetical

88
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,700
Society of Hawks and doves we get for example

89
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,540
If there's no cost of fighting at all Hawks will always drive doves to extinction

90
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,700
Inversely if there's an extremely high cost to Hawks fighting each other higher than having the food stolen from you as a dove then doves will

91
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,460
Drive the Hawks to extinction or rather the Hawks will destroy themselves and the doves will move into the space left behind

92
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,880
but what you'll find is no matter how you adjust the variables the population of Hawks and doves will always eventually reach an

93
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,660
Equilibrium where the population will sustain itself based on how advantageous it is to either fight or cooperate

94
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,620
The real world is obviously a lot more complicated than this

95
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,460
But the game of Hawks and doves can be applied to any social interaction where there is risk and reward

96
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:17,700
Associated with both fight and flight and the lesson we can take away is if a society is set up such that theft is more

97
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:24,380
Profitable than reaction to theft is detrimental then that society will be overrun by thieves and in case you think I'm just babbling a whole bunch

98
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,660
Of theory out my ass and that has no application in the real world

99
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,620
We are already seeing this play out in real time back in 2014

100
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,520
California reclassified shoplifting valued at

101
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,940
$950 or less from a felony to a misdemeanor and

102
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:44,860
Unsurprisingly shoplifting has increased videos routinely go viral of people stealing just under that amount knowing that security guards won't stop them

103
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:51,740
Cops won't be called and if the cops are called a misdemeanor isn't exactly high priority if a society makes the punishment for stealing this

104
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,200
Low if it's more profitable to steal than to work

105
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,540
Honestly people will steal and if enough people are stealing and not working then they're not producing

106
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:06,980
Meaning that there's nothing left to steal and eventually society collapses the counter-argument to this is that society can sometimes make theft too

107
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,380
Punishing or innocence can get swept up in the hysteria of crime fighting and that can happen

108
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,060
But firstly that's no reason to swing across to the other extreme to say theft is good

109
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,900
Actually, especially from the crowd that says that employment and profit are theft and secondly

110
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,580
It's been my experience that radicals of all types progressive and reactionary left and right doesn't matter

111
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,060
They completely forget about the existence of the golden mean yes a society that is too strict is bad

112
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:38,720
But so is a society that's too lax when a libertarian says government regulation makes everything worse in all possible

113
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,820
Situations and the socialist says that the free market leads to ruin in all possible situations. They're both making the same mistake

114
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,860
They're ignoring the golden mean government can ruin things the free market can ruin things, too

115
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,260
But it doesn't necessarily have to be that way and the same goes for theft and law enforcement

116
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,700
All of this being said if you wake up in the middle of the night and hear a burglar prowling around

117
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,100
You're probably not thinking any of this extended political stuff

118
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,940
You're probably thinking about how to defend your family, which means you're thinking about game theory

119
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,940
Even if you don't know it

120
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,780
You don't know if the burglar is a hawk or a dove so your response will be based on the cost of fighting if the burglar

121
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,300
Is a dove and regardless of the cost of fighting you should be a hawk because if you fight the burglar will give up or run

122
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,940
Away, if the burglar is a hawk then suddenly it becomes unknown what you should do if you're a dove

123
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,820
Will the burglar just take your stuff and leave or will he kill you?

124
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,300
Will he kill everybody else in the house? If you're a hawk, what will be the cost of fighting with another hawk?

125
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
It's all entirely unknown

126
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,220
But one thing becomes clear the possibility of losing everything not just your stuff

127
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,620
But your life your family's life if you choose to play as a dove is

128
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,220
On the table if the cost of playing as a dove versus a hawk is higher than the maximum possible

129
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,340
Cost of two hawks fighting then regardless of the damage you both might do being a hawk is always the better choice

130
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,820
In other words in a room full of doves hawks to stabilize things

131
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,380
But in a room full of hawks being a hawk is your only shot at survival and in a room full of unknowns in almost every

132
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,940
Situation it's better to be a hawk progressives. Just don't think this way

133
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,180
They say what sounds good and moral and will get their friends to accept them

134
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,580
But they don't really go beyond that and you know what I can make a good solid

135
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,980
Moral argument for home defense to people in the house depend on me and defending them is more important

136
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,340
My property represents the labor I perform to build or buy it making me a slave you steal it from me

137
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,220
But I don't even need to appeal to morality to refute the progressive position even in the most rational

138
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:34,420
Scientific materialist view of things which I'm sure the Prague will appreciate more than something like honor as long as you have others depending on

139
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,620
You whose lives mean more to you than your own

140
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,740
It will always be more worth it to defend them than to risk them the mindset of the person who thinks otherwise

141
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,820
Seems to be the mindset of the person who doesn't have anybody that they view as worth defending
