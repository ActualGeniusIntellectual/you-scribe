00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
Hello everyone and welcome to TikTok Tuesday. Listen, I know last week's show,

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,960
there was a video where a guy was, what was it? He was jumping up from a subway and it was coming in.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,000
Yeah, it was in reverse. I'm sorry. Every single comment who said on that last one,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,120
it's in reverse. I get it guys. I get it. I know. All right. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,360
These things happen sometimes, you know? Sorry. Sorry. But we're here to check out a different

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,320
batch of TikToks that I can be wrong about. I don't have audio on this one. My son who made

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,680
me a pregnant grandma at 33. What? What? Okay. This has to be a troll. I don't, this is the first

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,760
video of the day and I've already like hit zero on the dev gas tank. There's no way. My son who

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,920
made me a pregnant grandma at 33. Hold on. I got to parse this. Okay. She's a pregnant grandma.

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,280
That means that she has a child who already has a child. I assume that's her son.

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,160
So did her son impregnate her and that's why she's pregnant or is she pregnant with her third kid

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,400
and her son impregnated somebody else? Listen guys, this shit only ever happens in Alabama

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:22,920
or in anime. Oh, okay. There's an art piece. Yeah. It's clearly the holding Jesus thing,

14
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:35,960
but it's this person. I mean, uh, oh, look at all the spilled paint. Yeah. This is definitely

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,800
a modern art gallery. Isn't it? I mean, listen, yeah, that guy, he looks, uh, that fellow looks

16
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,800
pretty strange. Doesn't he? The art world is a very strange place, guys. There's a lot of weirdos

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,320
hanging around in there, but that's, uh, that's not my scene. That's for sure. Happy Friday,

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:02:18,640
it's Tuesday actually. Okay. The book didn't say majority though.

19
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:27,080
Oh, we have the protect trans kids pin right there. Why? Like if we're really getting serious

20
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:34,600
about what people think teachers are doing in the classroom, why is that? Why is that on a book?

21
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,760
What's wrong with that? A picture representing families. What's wrong with it? I'm just asking

22
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,760
on this Friday. You're just asking, but what are you implying? Like, hold on, let's go back. This

23
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,760
is the majority families, but it doesn't even say that it says multiplication and division

24
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,160
fact, family practice book. It doesn't say majority. It just has a picture of a dad and a

25
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,760
mom and a kid. What's the problem. Is it because it's not a gay couple? Is it? Cause it's not like

26
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,000
an interracial couple or something. What's the objection here? You just not like seeing white

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,480
people in media. There's definitely a shit ton of people out there who are just like, man,

28
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,160
there's a black woman in this game or whatever. It's gotta be woke. It can't be good,

29
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,920
which isn't true. But now we see the opposite of people just not liking the fact that whites exist.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,120
Whoa. Oh my God.

31
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:38,760
Dude, this, this midgets probably gonna actually die of snoo snoo. God damn. That's,

32
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,440
that's one way to go out. Isn't it? What do you think? Fellas? Would you yes or no?

33
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,600
Wait, is it deep? Put, wait, is that gas in the cup?

34
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:05,240
Are you fucking kidding? Why dude? Like there's, there's so many humans on the planet at this point

35
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,600
that I guarantee you, someone has done something, anything, you know what I mean? It's like,

36
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,000
no one would ever have been done enough to do that. Like drink a shot of gasoline

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,160
right out of the pump. Nope. There's the guy who did it. Oh my God. Paying parking tickets and

38
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:39,000
pennies. Just dump it all out. Fuck you. Yep. Here you go. Enjoy. Here's all your fucking money.

39
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:49,640
Oh, there you go. You know,

40
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,320
I understand the reason for parking tickets before. So unless you have it counted by the

41
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,920
bank and they have it out, you don't have a counter here. Oh, I'm sorry. It's too bad.

42
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,640
It's all yours already though. $75. You don't have a counter here. They won't accept it.

43
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,760
Okay. Well, here's what I'll do. Do you have a, I guess you can use this pen here. Can I see the

44
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,680
ticket for a sec? So, okay. So if there's any problems, you're more than welcome to call me,

45
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,320
but as of right now, the payment's been made. Have a nice day.

46
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,040
I love malicious compliance. Yes. I am somewhat of a Redditor. I do go on to their malicious

47
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,920
compliance server that sometimes, yes, you can crucify me, but that's always fun to watch. Isn't

48
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:43,160
it? Oh, got to mute it. Wait, what is this? Is that like, is that minced meat,

49
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,480
like ground beef or something? He's just plastering.

50
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,080
Okay. I think, I think you guys are just sending me troll videos now. Like there's no,

51
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,120
there's no reason. Okay. All right.

52
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,840
Whoa. Microwave man?

53
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,720
Is that his helmet? Okay. So was that like a superhero or was that his helmet or was

54
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,760
it just a crack head? Maybe all three. Oh, some more music. I'm going to do that again.

55
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,680
This is like a Joe Rogan doing a UFC thing.

56
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,760
Oh, he's not looking. Don't look, Joe. Don't look. Your wife is watching. Don't do it.

57
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,520
Don't do it, Joe. You're going to get in trouble. That, okay. The face that he had on looked like

58
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,800
a face that he's been in trouble for it before. And his wife was like, listen, when those girls

59
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,040
are undressing for their way in or whatever, you can't be doing that shit, dude. You know,

60
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,720
I thought we weren't going to get any weird trans stuff in this round of TikToks.

61
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,040
We almost did with that teacher, but I finally, I finally dug one up. Here we go. This is from Kat

62
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,400
who whose pronouns are fae fem. All right. Let's, let's see what, let's see what this person has to

63
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:37,160
say. Microaggressions, guys? Oh, Jesus. Hold on. Maybe my foot's in my mouth. That's a,

64
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:46,920
that's a bit crazy if true. I just had a man in public.

65
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,200
Bam. He can't wait until he can legally hunt us down.

66
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,000
So. This is not okay. You guys think this is true? This is not okay.

67
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Cause here's the thing. I've definitely seen videos of people saying that, right? Like there'd

68
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,080
be, you know, a guy who looks like a griper or something. He, and he goes up to someone who has

69
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,560
like dyed hair who has like a trans flag or whatever the fuck. Right. And then says,

70
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,520
I can't wait until we can take away all your rights. In fact, I included that clip in, in

71
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,320
the three forms of fascism video, there's a bunch of clips like that. I'm just guys going around

72
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,880
saying, I can't wait until open season begins. You know, it's like, Jesus, that's pretty fucked up.

73
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,240
But also people like this are not known for their honesty. So I, I don't know.

74
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,400
It's going pretty far, dude.

75
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:59,720
Oh, oh, wait. Is that like on the field now?

76
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:16,120
And there it is. Oh, is it? Yeah. Oh my God, man. That's probably the most fun that's ever happened

77
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,640
at a soccer game. I'm not a sports guy. I don't know if you guys can tell I'm definitely a video

78
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,520
game guy, not a sports guy. Cosplay as a Nazi. Oh man. Oh, mega clips.

79
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,040
What did you say? I hate gay people or black people.

80
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,080
What's the matter with you? You're disgusting. You don't take care of yourself.

81
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,440
Oh my God. I don't want to take care of myself. What do you think I'm doing right now? I'm doing

82
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:59,400
my hair. That's not taking care of yourself. Eat less, move more please. I had breakfast.

83
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,960
I worked out this morning. What else do you want me to do? I think you had a bit too much breakfast.

84
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,520
Oh my God. I don't like you anymore. People ask us why we hate white people.

85
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:22,520
Oh, okay. Okay. I know that I'm already scraping the bottom of the barrel

86
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,600
when it comes to doing TikTok content, but should I do Omegle content too?

87
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:36,200
Because that was ridiculous. Oh my God, dude. I think that's the end. That's the end of the line

88
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,120
for old dev today. Listen, new videos are coming. Dave is in fact working on right now while I

89
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,760
record this because I posted on Twitter and on Discord and I think in the community notes

90
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:54,280
or no, the community tab of my channel that a big video was recorded and is currently being edited.

91
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,640
So that's what Dave's doing right now. You'll see dev videos soon. Okay. They're coming. They're

92
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,480
coming soon. Things are looking up for old dev. I'm back on the upswing when it comes to getting

93
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,240
work done. So I will see you guys there. Oh, of course. Stream tonight as well. Make sure

94
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,240
you're there. I'll see you. Okay. Have a good one. I love you.
