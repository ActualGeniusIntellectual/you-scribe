Hello everyone and welcome to TikTok Tuesday. Listen, I know last week's show,

00:06.320 --> 00:12.960
there was a video where a guy was, what was it? He was jumping up from a subway and it was coming in.

00:12.960 --> 00:18.000
Yeah, it was in reverse. I'm sorry. Every single comment who said on that last one,

00:18.000 --> 00:23.120
it's in reverse. I get it guys. I get it. I know. All right. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect.

00:23.120 --> 00:29.360
These things happen sometimes, you know? Sorry. Sorry. But we're here to check out a different

00:29.360 --> 00:34.320
batch of TikToks that I can be wrong about. I don't have audio on this one. My son who made

00:34.320 --> 00:39.680
me a pregnant grandma at 33. What? What? Okay. This has to be a troll. I don't, this is the first

00:39.680 --> 00:45.760
video of the day and I've already like hit zero on the dev gas tank. There's no way. My son who

00:45.760 --> 00:53.920
made me a pregnant grandma at 33. Hold on. I got to parse this. Okay. She's a pregnant grandma.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.280
That means that she has a child who already has a child. I assume that's her son.

00:57.280 --> 01:04.160
So did her son impregnate her and that's why she's pregnant or is she pregnant with her third kid

01:04.160 --> 01:09.400
and her son impregnated somebody else? Listen guys, this shit only ever happens in Alabama

01:09.400 --> 01:22.920
or in anime. Oh, okay. There's an art piece. Yeah. It's clearly the holding Jesus thing,

01:22.920 --> 01:35.960
but it's this person. I mean, uh, oh, look at all the spilled paint. Yeah. This is definitely

01:35.960 --> 01:39.800
a modern art gallery. Isn't it? I mean, listen, yeah, that guy, he looks, uh, that fellow looks

01:39.800 --> 01:44.800
pretty strange. Doesn't he? The art world is a very strange place, guys. There's a lot of weirdos

01:44.800 --> 01:49.320
hanging around in there, but that's, uh, that's not my scene. That's for sure. Happy Friday,

01:49.320 --> 02:18.640
it's Tuesday actually. Okay. The book didn't say majority though.

02:19.880 --> 02:27.080
Oh, we have the protect trans kids pin right there. Why? Like if we're really getting serious

02:27.080 --> 02:34.600
about what people think teachers are doing in the classroom, why is that? Why is that on a book?

02:35.320 --> 02:40.760
What's wrong with that? A picture representing families. What's wrong with it? I'm just asking

02:41.640 --> 02:46.760
on this Friday. You're just asking, but what are you implying? Like, hold on, let's go back. This

02:46.760 --> 02:52.760
is the majority families, but it doesn't even say that it says multiplication and division

02:53.800 --> 02:59.160
fact, family practice book. It doesn't say majority. It just has a picture of a dad and a

02:59.160 --> 03:04.760
mom and a kid. What's the problem. Is it because it's not a gay couple? Is it? Cause it's not like

03:04.760 --> 03:09.000
an interracial couple or something. What's the objection here? You just not like seeing white

03:09.000 --> 03:13.480
people in media. There's definitely a shit ton of people out there who are just like, man,

03:13.480 --> 03:17.160
there's a black woman in this game or whatever. It's gotta be woke. It can't be good,

03:17.160 --> 03:22.920
which isn't true. But now we see the opposite of people just not liking the fact that whites exist.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.120
Whoa. Oh my God.

03:31.640 --> 03:38.760
Dude, this, this midgets probably gonna actually die of snoo snoo. God damn. That's,

03:38.760 --> 03:42.440
that's one way to go out. Isn't it? What do you think? Fellas? Would you yes or no?

03:43.480 --> 03:50.600
Wait, is it deep? Put, wait, is that gas in the cup?

03:56.040 --> 04:05.240
Are you fucking kidding? Why dude? Like there's, there's so many humans on the planet at this point

04:05.240 --> 04:10.600
that I guarantee you, someone has done something, anything, you know what I mean? It's like,

04:10.600 --> 04:15.000
no one would ever have been done enough to do that. Like drink a shot of gasoline

04:15.000 --> 04:23.160
right out of the pump. Nope. There's the guy who did it. Oh my God. Paying parking tickets and

04:23.160 --> 04:39.000
pennies. Just dump it all out. Fuck you. Yep. Here you go. Enjoy. Here's all your fucking money.

04:39.000 --> 04:49.640
Oh, there you go. You know,

04:52.520 --> 04:57.320
I understand the reason for parking tickets before. So unless you have it counted by the

04:57.320 --> 05:00.920
bank and they have it out, you don't have a counter here. Oh, I'm sorry. It's too bad.

05:00.920 --> 05:05.640
It's all yours already though. $75. You don't have a counter here. They won't accept it.

05:05.640 --> 05:10.760
Okay. Well, here's what I'll do. Do you have a, I guess you can use this pen here. Can I see the

05:10.760 --> 05:16.680
ticket for a sec? So, okay. So if there's any problems, you're more than welcome to call me,

05:16.680 --> 05:19.320
but as of right now, the payment's been made. Have a nice day.

05:23.720 --> 05:30.040
I love malicious compliance. Yes. I am somewhat of a Redditor. I do go on to their malicious

05:30.040 --> 05:34.920
compliance server that sometimes, yes, you can crucify me, but that's always fun to watch. Isn't

05:35.560 --> 05:43.160
it? Oh, got to mute it. Wait, what is this? Is that like, is that minced meat,

05:43.160 --> 05:45.480
like ground beef or something? He's just plastering.

05:51.400 --> 05:57.080
Okay. I think, I think you guys are just sending me troll videos now. Like there's no,

05:57.720 --> 06:02.120
there's no reason. Okay. All right.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.840
Whoa. Microwave man?

06:20.680 --> 06:27.720
Is that his helmet? Okay. So was that like a superhero or was that his helmet or was

06:27.720 --> 06:32.760
it just a crack head? Maybe all three. Oh, some more music. I'm going to do that again.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.680
This is like a Joe Rogan doing a UFC thing.

06:39.560 --> 06:44.760
Oh, he's not looking. Don't look, Joe. Don't look. Your wife is watching. Don't do it.

06:47.080 --> 06:52.520
Don't do it, Joe. You're going to get in trouble. That, okay. The face that he had on looked like

06:52.520 --> 06:55.800
a face that he's been in trouble for it before. And his wife was like, listen, when those girls

06:55.800 --> 07:00.040
are undressing for their way in or whatever, you can't be doing that shit, dude. You know,

07:00.040 --> 07:03.720
I thought we weren't going to get any weird trans stuff in this round of TikToks.

07:04.360 --> 07:10.040
We almost did with that teacher, but I finally, I finally dug one up. Here we go. This is from Kat

07:10.040 --> 07:15.400
who whose pronouns are fae fem. All right. Let's, let's see what, let's see what this person has to

07:15.400 --> 07:37.160
say. Microaggressions, guys? Oh, Jesus. Hold on. Maybe my foot's in my mouth. That's a,

07:37.160 --> 07:46.920
that's a bit crazy if true. I just had a man in public.

07:49.240 --> 07:54.200
Bam. He can't wait until he can legally hunt us down.

07:58.120 --> 08:03.000
So. This is not okay. You guys think this is true? This is not okay.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
Cause here's the thing. I've definitely seen videos of people saying that, right? Like there'd

08:09.000 --> 08:13.080
be, you know, a guy who looks like a griper or something. He, and he goes up to someone who has

08:13.080 --> 08:17.560
like dyed hair who has like a trans flag or whatever the fuck. Right. And then says,

08:17.560 --> 08:22.520
I can't wait until we can take away all your rights. In fact, I included that clip in, in

08:22.520 --> 08:27.320
the three forms of fascism video, there's a bunch of clips like that. I'm just guys going around

08:27.320 --> 08:31.880
saying, I can't wait until open season begins. You know, it's like, Jesus, that's pretty fucked up.

08:32.680 --> 08:37.240
But also people like this are not known for their honesty. So I, I don't know.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.400
It's going pretty far, dude.

08:51.400 --> 08:59.720
Oh, oh, wait. Is that like on the field now?

09:04.920 --> 09:16.120
And there it is. Oh, is it? Yeah. Oh my God, man. That's probably the most fun that's ever happened

09:16.120 --> 09:19.640
at a soccer game. I'm not a sports guy. I don't know if you guys can tell I'm definitely a video

09:19.640 --> 09:24.520
game guy, not a sports guy. Cosplay as a Nazi. Oh man. Oh, mega clips.

09:35.800 --> 09:42.040
What did you say? I hate gay people or black people.

09:42.040 --> 09:47.080
What's the matter with you? You're disgusting. You don't take care of yourself.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.440
Oh my God. I don't want to take care of myself. What do you think I'm doing right now? I'm doing

09:50.440 --> 09:59.400
my hair. That's not taking care of yourself. Eat less, move more please. I had breakfast.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.960
I worked out this morning. What else do you want me to do? I think you had a bit too much breakfast.

10:03.960 --> 10:08.520
Oh my God. I don't like you anymore. People ask us why we hate white people.

10:09.480 --> 10:22.520
Oh, okay. Okay. I know that I'm already scraping the bottom of the barrel

10:24.280 --> 10:28.600
when it comes to doing TikTok content, but should I do Omegle content too?

10:28.600 --> 10:36.200
Because that was ridiculous. Oh my God, dude. I think that's the end. That's the end of the line

10:36.200 --> 10:42.120
for old dev today. Listen, new videos are coming. Dave is in fact working on right now while I

10:42.120 --> 10:48.760
record this because I posted on Twitter and on Discord and I think in the community notes

10:48.760 --> 10:54.280
or no, the community tab of my channel that a big video was recorded and is currently being edited.

10:54.280 --> 10:59.640
So that's what Dave's doing right now. You'll see dev videos soon. Okay. They're coming. They're

10:59.640 --> 11:05.480
coming soon. Things are looking up for old dev. I'm back on the upswing when it comes to getting

11:05.480 --> 11:11.240
work done. So I will see you guys there. Oh, of course. Stream tonight as well. Make sure

11:11.240 --> 11:15.240
you're there. I'll see you. Okay. Have a good one. I love you.
