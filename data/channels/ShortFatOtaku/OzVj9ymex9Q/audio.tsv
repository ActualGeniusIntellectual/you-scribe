0	2500	We are now living in a socialist paradise.
2500	3600	No, really.
3600	9600	Industries are closing down, capitalism is being replaced by Trump bucks, Trudeau bucks, Boris bucks.
9600	13700	We're living simpler lives, less travel, way fewer carbon emissions,
13700	16500	governments are nationalizing and taking over everything.
16500	20000	This is what the far left has been advocating for for years.
20000	21000	How do you like it?
21000	25200	How does it feel that you can no longer freely consent to enter into employment with somebody,
25200	27800	to negotiate for a wage in a field you're interested in,
27800	30300	and instead you simply have to stay home and take what you're given?
30300	32700	How does it feel that you can no longer go outside?
32700	37400	That those roads, those parks, those schools and libraries that you pay tax money for,
37400	38700	you can no longer use?
38700	41300	How does it feel with all private business shut down?
41300	45300	Because the state has decided that free people can no longer engage in commerce.
45300	47500	How do you like the socialist paradise?
47500	50100	This is a document that Naomi's been given by her workplace
50100	52800	that basically identifies her as an essential worker.
52800	54200	She works at a grocery store.
54200	57700	Canada is not yet at the level where we're checking people's papers.
57700	61600	But various essential businesses have been giving these out anyway, just in case.
61600	63400	Some countries are a lot worse with it.
63400	64800	Here's one from France.
64800	67800	It basically says that in order to leave your house,
67800	70400	you have to fill this out and give it to the police.
70400	74300	It outlines who you are, where you live, and where you're going.
74300	75600	Here's Italy's form.
75600	77200	Pretty much the same thing.
77200	81900	What kind of free society asks you for your papers just so you can travel?
81900	83500	It's not just papers, though.
83500	88800	Westwood Bar boarded up by police after continuing to serve food and drinks indoors.
88800	90400	I mean, it's stupid.
90400	91200	But what's the problem?
91200	92700	It's people's choice.
92700	96600	If idiots want to go there and get sick, isn't that their prerogative?
96600	100300	Isn't it on the individual to be responsible and manage their own life?
100300	106200	On Monday night, Queen City Lounge had 40 customers inside drinking and eating from a full buffet.
106200	110900	On Tuesday afternoon, several arrests later, police boarded the place up.
110900	113400	The Westwood Bar had continued to operate as usual,
113400	118600	despite Ohio Governor Mike DeWine's order that all restaurants and bars in the state of Ohio
118600	121900	end their dine-in services to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
121900	124900	It was more than a risk to patrons, the police chief added.
124900	129000	Now you're putting first responders at risk because we get the information that they're open.
129000	130600	There's 40-plus people inside.
130600	133700	Who knows who may have already come into contact with coronavirus,
133700	136900	and now our first responders are having to interact with those folks.
136900	140000	It wasn't the first warning the Queen City Lounge had received.
140000	141700	It pains us to have to do this.
141700	144000	It pains us that we are in these uncharted waters.
144000	146500	This is new territory for your police department.
146500	148700	What new territory? Being authoritarians?
148700	151500	Yes, I agree with you. It's stupid that they're still open.
151500	154300	It's stupid that people are congregating there.
154300	157400	But are you actually saying that people don't have the right to be stupid?
157400	161400	It's not good for them to be stupid, but should the government prevent them from being?
161400	163900	Is safety a more important value than freedom?
163900	165100	Is that where we are now?
165100	167800	Well, this is where that kind of thinking goes.
167900	172400	Rhode Island police to hunt down New Yorkers seeking refuge.
172400	176200	Cars are stopped, homes to be checked to enforce quarantines.
176200	180200	Officers halt cars on the interstate to start the crackdown.
180200	183800	What's going on here is that the state of New York is seriously suffering from coronavirus,
183800	186200	far worse than most of the rest of the United States.
186200	188500	And so people who have a New York license plate on their vehicles,
188500	191000	but are driving to Rhode Island to get away from it,
191000	194000	are going to be rounded up by the Rhode Island police.
194000	196800	This is the type of totalitarian nightmare you get
196800	199400	when safety is a higher virtue than freedom.
199400	202500	The state can justify violating all sorts of rights
202500	204900	if it views it to be in the person's best interest.
204900	207700	And if the state's view of what your best interest is
207700	210300	comes into conflict with your right of self-determination,
210300	211500	well, fuck you then.
211500	214300	Yesterday I announced, and today I reiterated,
214300	218000	anyone coming to Rhode Island in any way from New York must be quarantined,
218000	219000	the governor said.
219000	222100	By order, will be enforced, enforceable by law.
222100	225000	She signed an executive order Thursday that applies to anyone
225000	227500	who has been in New York during the past two weeks,
227500	229700	and through at least April 25th.
229700	233900	National Guard members will be stationed at the T.F. Green Airport,
233900	236700	Amtrak train stations, and at bus stops.
236700	241600	The citizen soldiers will be following up with people at local residences.
241600	246700	The maximum penalty for not complying is a fine of $500 and 90 days in prison.
246700	249400	The American Civil Liberties Union blasted the new rules,
249400	252600	objecting to the collection of the motorist contact information in particular.
252600	256400	While the governor may have the power to suspend some state laws and regulations
256400	260400	to address this medical emergency, she cannot suspend the constitution.
260400	263800	Under the Fourth Amendment, having a New York state license plate
263800	267500	simply does not, and cannot, constitute probable cause
267500	270500	to allow police to stop a car and interrogate the driver,
270500	273700	no matter how laudable the goal of the stop may be.
273700	274800	And they're absolutely right.
274800	277200	The ACLU has been kind of hit and miss recently,
277200	279400	but this is absolutely the case.
279400	282900	People's natural rights do not vanish just because of an emergency,
282900	287700	and you can tell exactly which politicians have always been authoritarians in waiting,
287700	289900	based on how they're responding to this crisis.
289900	292100	Speaking of citizen soldiers,
292100	297300	this would not be a complete video if we didn't watch all the various snitches that are floating around right now.
297300	298200	Let's check it out.
309400	313600	You're a little pop, seriously? Seriously, I called the cops.
313600	314400	I can't watch.
314400	317200	I'm so scared. I'm so scared.
317200	321400	Shouldn't she be social distancing from them?
321400	324900	They closed the window on her, dude. She's spitting all over the place.
324900	328100	Like seriously, what's going on here? The road is empty.
328100	330300	These are just two kids driving around in the car.
330300	333000	They're not doing anything. They're not exposing anybody to coronavirus.
333000	336100	Like they leave their house, they hop in the car, they drive around,
336100	338300	they go back to their house, they go back inside.
338300	341600	Just to get, just to get the fuck out for a minute or two.
341600	345000	And you have these moral busybodies who just can't wait to get you in trouble
345000	347600	because they have nothing else going on in their pathetic lives.
347600	350600	This one looks like it's from the UK, just based on the signs and what they're wearing
350600	354300	and some of the stuff that's on the road, but we'll see.
354300	355300	Hi guys.
355300	355600	Hello.
355600	357300	Do you work for the NHS?
357300	358500	Uh, no.
358500	359800	Who do you work for?
359800	361300	For community fibre.
361300	363300	So what are you laying?
363300	364100	Fibre.
364100	366000	Fibre. What kind of fibre?
366000	367600	Fibre optic, 5G ones.
367600	371100	But you're not supposed to be within two metres of each other
371100	374600	and you're supposed to be essential. Is this essential work?
374600	376600	Uh, I think so. I don't know.
376600	379100	He just sent me to do the job and I just can't.
379100	381900	Dude, they're laying 5G fibre optic cable.
381900	384200	They're causing the coronavirus.
384200	386600	I understand it's not essential and you don't work for the NHS.
386600	387600	So why are you doing it?
387600	390800	Does it not negate the government's guidelines?
390800	392900	Yeah, if you want to make a complaint.
392900	395200	Who do I complain to? Who's your boss?
395200	398200	Uh, I have a number for the courtesy board.
398200	400700	Where is the white van and the red barriers.
400700	401700	If you want to call.
401700	403700	But do you know what you're doing now? You're laying 5G.
403700	404700	Yeah.
404700	405700	You realise that, don't you?
405700	406200	Yeah.
406200	406700	Yeah?
406700	407200	Yeah.
407200	409200	So what, do you know that kills people?
409200	412200	You know, I said that as a joke.
412200	414200	I didn't know she was actually going to go there.
414200	416200	They turn this on, it's going to kill everyone
416200	418200	and that's why they're building the hospitals?
418200	419200	Yep.
419200	420700	How do you feel? Do you have children?
420700	422200	No, I'm young.
422200	423200	Do you have parents?
424200	425200	Just my mum.
425200	428200	Well, how do you feel when they turn that switch on?
428200	429200	Bye-bye, mama.
429200	430200	Holy shit, lady.
430200	432200	Like, let him get on with his fucking work, dude.
432200	434700	If you want to complain, call his head office.
434700	437700	Like, okay, I've done this kind of work before.
437700	440200	Not laying 5G, obviously, but you know, this kind of,
440200	443200	you're out in the streets and you're doing public service work.
443200	445200	And we were always told,
445200	449200	listen, if someone has a complaint about the labourer's work,
449200	451200	they call the head office, they call the town hall,
451200	452700	they call the public works office.
452700	454700	They don't try to get us to stop it,
454700	457700	because even though our salaries were funded by taxes,
457700	459700	an individual member of the public doesn't have the right
459700	461700	to liaison directly with an individual worker.
461700	463700	That's not how the system works.
463700	465700	There are ways you can complain and change things,
465700	467700	but not by harassing a low-level worker.
467700	471700	We'll all be in hospital on breathing apparatus.
471700	474700	Why do you think they're building 25,000
474700	477700	sort of concentration camps of death?
477700	480700	Are hospitals concentration camps now?
480700	481700	Holy shit.
481700	483700	They called those camps at the border concentration camps.
483700	486700	I'm pretty sure that they were places to detain people
486700	489700	before they deport them, not places that they put people to keep them in.
489700	491700	They were throwing them out.
491700	495700	But listen, like, just because the state has to put people somewhere
495700	499700	because of some reason, many of which are legitimate,
499700	501700	doesn't mean that it's a concentration camp.
501700	505700	Video. Americans being forced to take the coronavirus test.
505700	507700	This can't be good.
508700	510700	Please leave me alone.
510700	512700	Please leave me alone.
512700	514700	Please leave me alone.
514700	516700	Please leave me alone.
516700	517700	Please leave me alone, bro.
517700	519700	Not until you get on the bed.
519700	520700	I'm not getting on the bed.
520700	522700	Man, help me out, bro.
522700	524700	It doesn't work like that, bro.
524700	526700	Can anybody know a lawyer, bro?
526700	528700	Somebody sent me a lawyer.
528700	531700	No, no, no!
531700	533700	It don't work like that, man.
533700	535700	This shit ain't right, man.
535700	538700	Nah, don't put the phone down now, motherfucker.
538700	540700	Now, bro, leave me alone.
540700	541700	I don't want to leave it on my own.
541700	543700	It don't work like that.
543700	545700	It does not work like that, bro.
545700	547700	No, no.
547700	549700	Y'all need to change mental health awareness.
549700	551700	Mental health help.
551700	553700	Man, no.
553700	555700	No, man.
555700	557700	No, no.
557700	559700	The time is now.
559700	561700	The time is now.
561700	562700	No.
562700	563700	I'm not on drugs.
563700	564700	None of that, bro.
564700	565700	I'm insane.
565700	567700	I'm insane, man.
567700	569700	Y'all don't want this crazy.
569700	571700	Y'all don't want this crazy, bro.
571700	572700	No.
572700	573700	No.
573700	574700	Uh-uh.
574700	575700	No.
575700	577700	Bro, get your motherfucking hands off me, bro.
577700	579700	It don't work like this, bro.
579700	581700	I would tear this bitch up, nigga, on my mother, nigga.
581700	583700	Get off of me.
583700	585700	Get off me, bro.
585700	586700	It don't work like that.
586700	587700	I'm not crazy.
587700	588700	You crazy, right, man?
588700	589700	Leave me alone, bro.
589700	591700	Yeah, you did.
591700	593700	I'm not scared of nothing, bro.
593700	595700	I'm not scared of nothing, bro.
595700	597700	Please leave me the fuck alone, bro.
597700	599700	It don't work like that, bro.
599700	600700	Come on.
600700	602700	Get off me.
602700	603700	Holy shit.
603700	605700	Y'all weak as a bitch.
605700	606700	Right here.
606700	607700	J, come on.
607700	608700	Come on, bro.
608700	612700	Come on.
612700	613700	Stop.
613700	614700	Stop.
614700	615700	Hey.
615700	616700	You're choking me.
616700	617700	You're choking me.
617700	618700	You're choking me, bro.
618700	619700	Stop.
619700	620700	You're choking me, bro.
620700	621700	Uh-uh.
621700	622700	Stop.
622700	623700	Help.
623700	624700	Stop.
624700	625700	Help, man.
625700	626700	This shit ain't right, bro.
626700	627700	Stop.
627700	628700	Stop.
628700	629700	Stop.
629700	630700	Stop.
630700	631700	This shit ain't right.
631700	632700	Aah.
632700	633700	Aah.
633700	634700	Aah.
634700	635700	Aah.
635700	636700	Aah, motherfucker.
636700	637700	All right.
637700	640700	It's going to be a revolution now.
640700	642700	Y'all already know what's ahead of the story.
642700	646700	Y'all have to get it into motion.
646700	647700	Yeah.
647700	649700	Jesus Christ.
649700	659960	Okay, so I understand the necessity of testing people for a novel new disease, but it's my
659960	665940	understanding that not only human rights, but medical ethics dictate that until someone
665940	672500	falls unconscious, if they are actively refusing treatment, you can't treat them?
672500	674860	This seems wildly unethical.
674860	679180	Like, you always hear about people who, like, they're overdosing on drugs and they're like,
679180	681740	no, man, I don't want treatment, I just want to die.
681740	683020	And the paramedics are there.
683020	686540	And they have to wait for the person to fall unconscious before they can start treating
686540	689780	them because they are explicitly not consenting.
689780	691700	But these people, they just don't fucking care.
691700	693380	It's disgusting.
693380	696380	I've seen this one a few times, but check this shit out, guys.
696380	698660	This is some South American country.
698660	703300	They have squads of people in hazmat suits running around, just chasing down anyone they
703300	706020	see in public.
706020	708580	If you catch somebody, you lock them up.
708580	711620	I think this video is from Massachusetts.
711620	716100	A church here is doing a drive-in method of holding services.
716100	720260	The idea being that I guess they all sit in their cars and they give the service?
720260	721260	I'm not sure.
721260	724100	Let's see what happens.
724100	725100	Look at this, y'all.
725100	731140	All these, they heard through the grapevine we're having service at 6.30.
731140	734700	And there's more police cars at a church service.
734900	738860	Yes, this is King James Bible Baptist Church where Pastor Hamilton, where I'm the pastor
738860	740140	of the church at.
740140	742820	This is America, private property of a church.
742820	743820	Look at this, y'all.
743820	744820	There's more police pulling up.
744820	745820	They ain't done.
745820	746820	Yes, sir.
746820	750020	I got a letter from my lawyer, too.
750020	752020	You want to read my letter from my lawyer?
752020	753900	Okay, I'm good.
753900	754900	I got that.
754900	755900	I know.
755900	756900	I know about it.
756900	757900	Yes, sir.
757900	758900	Yes, sir.
758900	759900	Yes, sir.
759900	760900	Yes, sir.
760900	761900	We're going to get tickets.
761900	762900	Yes, sir.
762900	763900	Yes.
763900	764900	Yes, sir.
764900	765900	Yes, sir.
765900	766900	Yes, sir.
766900	782260	No, the government, our right don't come from authority.
782260	783580	It comes from the Bible.
783580	786100	So the authority does not have the right over the Constitution.
786100	788100	We're talking about the constitutional law.
788100	792660	The first Second Amendment, the U.S. Constitution that was given to us by our forefather, Tate
792660	796500	Reid can't take it away, Eric Simmons can't take it away, nor the police officer.
796500	797500	It be suspended.
797500	798500	It can't.
798500	799500	By the military.
799500	800500	No, it can't.
800500	801740	Hey, look at this, y'all.
801740	803940	I'm a good citizen here.
803940	804940	I don't sell drugs.
804940	805940	Look at the police.
805940	807300	At least I'm as a pastor.
807300	810620	I got a police officer here, y'all, like I'm commending, like I'm robbing or I can kill
810620	811620	somebody.
811620	812620	This is what you...
812620	814460	They don't have this when a murderer is in Greenville, y'all.
814460	816660	Listen to these fucking pigs, dude.
816660	817660	Your rights are suspended.
818220	819340	Yeah, bullshit they are.
819340	824000	Natural rights can never be suspended, and the American Constitution is not suspended
824000	825580	because of a pandemic.
825580	828460	Multiple pandemics have happened throughout American history.
828460	830580	The Constitution was never suspended.
830580	834740	There is no mechanism by which it can be suspended in that way for that reason.
834740	837460	Fuck these power hungry tyrants.
837460	838700	Here's one from Philadelphia.
848660	850660	Yo, man, what are you saying, man?
850660	851660	That's orange, y'all.
851660	854660	What the fuck am I holding on to?
854660	856660	Yo, you gonna feel this, man?
856660	858660	Look what the fuck y'all are pulling on me, y'all, man.
858660	859660	Get the fuck off me.
859660	860660	Yeah.
860660	862660	Get the fuck off my fucking legs.
867660	870660	This man's crime was not wearing a mask on a bus.
870660	871660	That's it.
871660	873660	He wasn't causing a scene.
873660	875160	He wasn't coughing on anyone's face.
875160	876660	He wasn't spitting on them.
876660	879660	He was just sitting there without a mask.
879660	882660	Wouldn't it have been easier just to just give him a mask?
882660	888660	If you do not have a mask, you cannot ride public transportation, sir.
888660	889660	Sir.
889660	893660	You have to get off the bus, you have to get off the bus.
893660	894660	Sir.
895660	896660	Sir.
896660	897660	Let's go.
908660	909660	You gotta get off the bus, man.
909660	912660	I'm gonna have the cops take you off, one or the other.
912660	913660	You have to get off.
913660	914660	You have to get off.
914660	915660	You have to get off.
915660	916660	Let's go.
916660	917660	I have to get off?
917660	918660	Yes, sir.
918660	919660	You don't have no mask.
919660	920660	Let's go.
920660	921660	Let's go.
921660	922660	You gotta get off.
922660	923660	Let's go.
923660	924660	Let's go.
924660	925660	You gotta get off.
925660	926660	Fuck you.
926660	930660	You pay your taxes, you pay that fare, you're fucking entitled to it.
930660	934660	He was throwing people off who, like, they couldn't afford masks or couldn't find them, obviously.
934660	938660	They were wearing bandanas, they were putting stuff around their mouth, they were doing whatever they could.
938660	940660	And this guy's just a little fucking weasel.
940660	944660	If you really want to know how these people think, all you have to do is look at this short exchange.
944660	952660	We are aware of the reopened North Carolina protest that is occurring in downtown Raleigh on Wilmington and Jones Street and are monitoring the situation.
952660	956660	The protesters are in violation of the governor's executive order and have been asked to leave.
956660	959660	What part of the governor's order was violated here?
959660	962660	Protesting is a non-essential activity.
962660	965660	Protesting is the most essential activity.
965660	970660	The people have an inalienable right to petition the government for a redress of their grievances.
970660	974660	This does not go away just because there's an emergency.
974660	977660	It is you corrupt little shits that are non-essential.
977660	979660	It's not just America having this problem, obviously.
979660	985660	And it comes as a man was charged in Sydney after going for a swim at Bondi Beach, seen being pinned to the ground by police.
985660	991660	The 54-year-old man allegedly ignored signs that the beach was closed, entering a sectioned-off area.
991660	996660	I didn't break any law, I didn't climb any fences, I didn't do anything at all.
996660	1000660	I was, I had to swim, I had to swim off the rocks.
1000660	1008660	That police can do something to absolutely model citizen, law-abiding citizen, who never had treat me like absolute animal.
1009660	1017660	Some eastern suburbs beaches will reopen today for exercise, including Coogee, Maroubra and Clavelli, but sunbathing is still banned.
1017660	1020660	Look at that beach, dude. There's no one there.
1020660	1024660	Like, if you show up and you, you know, you flaunt the rules a little bit, you take a dip.
1024660	1028660	Are you spreading coronavirus? Are you poisoning the ocean with it or something?
1028660	1034660	If people social distance at the beach, if they social distance while sunbathing or whatever, then whose business is it?
1034660	1037660	This one's from the UK. I already know it's going to be crazy.
1037660	1039660	I'm picking up the plan at the same time.
1039660	1046660	But you were just stood, I wasn't stood here and come out because you was, I was come out because you were stood there saying, talking about is this needed and all that.
1046660	1047660	That's why I've come out.
1047660	1051660	No, no way. Give me a ticket for what?
1051660	1052660	For six hundred and six.
1052660	1054660	Give me a ticket for what?
1054660	1056660	You're a board guy.
1056660	1059660	Are you going to give me an eight out or just lock you up?
1059660	1060660	Lock me up for what?
1060660	1062660	Breaking Covid guy, lads.
1062660	1064660	Listen, put your hands on your head.
1064660	1065660	Put your hands on your head.
1065660	1067660	What?
1067660	1077660	Am I being threatened? Am I being threatened?
1077660	1082660	You got a bored, lazy police officer just harassing people for the sheer fucking fun of it.
1082660	1084660	Here's where things start to get crazy.
1084660	1088660	This guy's getting harassed for walking his dog.
1088660	1091660	The police just stroll up and ask him for his papers.
1091660	1094660	Look at me when I'm on the chat, well you're just a bit rude, innit?
1094660	1098660	Come on, I'm trying to educate you here and you're just looking at your phone, alright?
1098660	1102660	I don't want to find you sixty pounds, I'm making my way around Denver before you say something.
1102660	1107660	Educate you? Like it's the state's place to tell you what to fucking think.
1107660	1113660	When I seen you lot walking around in a group just then, walking all together, not even masks, you're all stood within six feet of me.
1113660	1114660	You want to buy me a mask, yeah?
1114660	1116660	You're all within six, you're all within six feet.
1116660	1123660	It's not his job to buy you a mask, that's your job. In fact, you have a job still, this guy probably doesn't have one.
1123660	1130660	Right, okay, so while you practice what you preach, yeah I know, you should be filming anyway, you should be filming anyway.
1130660	1133660	Don't put it on YouTube because my identity is not allowed on YouTube.
1133660	1134660	Oh.
1134660	1136660	Hahahaha.
1136660	1141660	Well, if you want to cross the ocean and try to get me to take the video down, go right the fuck ahead, lady.
1141660	1144660	Isn't it? 2297, what's your name please?
1144660	1145660	Sainsbury.
1145660	1146660	Thank you.
1146660	1147660	What's your name please?
1147660	1148660	I'm not going to give it to you, am I?
1148660	1150660	Well, I actually ended so close, you have to do this.
1150660	1151660	No, I don't.
1151660	1156660	I'm actually doing it the best, because I'm actually going to put you down for fine, for being out unnecessarily.
1156660	1159660	Look at this, he just didn't want to interact with her.
1159660	1166660	And so she's going to be like, uh, nope, now you have to tell me everything about you, even though there's no fucking probable cause.
1166660	1168660	Well, you had your dogs not on the lead, just saying.
1168660	1169660	I haven't got a dog.
1169660	1170660	Come here, come here.
1170660	1171660	I haven't got a dog.
1171660	1172660	I have a piece of dog control, you alright?
1172660	1173660	What's that?
1173660	1174660	Well, who of those dogs are yours?
1175660	1176660	Come here, come here.
1176660	1180660	He was discussing a dog last night, which is day-to-day business.
1180660	1183660	Day-to-day business is banned.
1183660	1186660	Well, I don't care if you walk around with dogs, not on a leash, you walk around with dogs.
1186660	1188660	Don't yell at me, because that's not going to work.
1188660	1190660	I don't care what you're going to do, alright?
1190660	1192660	Don't have such a bad attitude, okay?
1192660	1194660	You're going to have to arrest me.
1194660	1195660	For what?
1195660	1196660	Exactly, for what?
1196660	1197660	For what?
1197660	1198660	For what, exactly.
1198660	1199660	You'll have to arrest me.
1199660	1201660	Yeah, this is how you do it, man.
1201660	1202660	This is how you deal with it.
1202660	1209660	Maybe not necessarily as combative as this guy if you're in the States, but you definitely politely but firmly exercise your rights.
1209660	1211660	Don't consent to talking to the cops, guys.
1211660	1215660	If they're going to arrest you, they're going to arrest you, and you can argue it later.
1219660	1220660	Listen to the police.
1220660	1225660	You walk up to me without masks, and you walk up, and you're within six foot of each other, and you're within six foot of me.
1225660	1227660	Practice what you preach.
1227660	1229660	I'm not within six foot of anyone.
1229660	1230660	You came to me.
1233660	1234660	You came to me.
1237660	1238660	Does it matter?
1238660	1239660	My dog with me?
1239660	1240660	My dog's exercising.
1240660	1242660	My dog's running around.
1243660	1244660	I'm not going home.
1244660	1245660	I'm exercising.
1247660	1248660	Make your hour.
1248660	1250660	Are we living in Nazi Germany or something?
1253660	1254660	It's a guideline.
1254660	1255660	Guideline.
1255660	1256660	You just said the words.
1256660	1257660	Guideline.
1257660	1259660	It's a fucking guideline, dude.
1259660	1263660	Like she has the actual authority to tell him how long he can stay outside.
1263660	1264660	Fuck you.
1264660	1267660	Please don't step any closer towards me.
1267660	1268660	Please don't step any...
1268660	1269660	Look at this.
1269660	1270660	Look at this now.
1270660	1271660	Look at how close she's getting.
1271660	1272660	Look how close she's getting.
1272660	1274660	Yeah, now stay where you are.
1274660	1276660	I'm exercising my dog.
1277660	1279660	Well, why didn't you do your job?
1279660	1280660	What do you mean?
1280660	1281660	I'm walking my dog.
1282660	1284660	My dog was running around me.
1284660	1285660	And then you came up.
1285660	1286660	You came up without masks.
1286660	1288660	Within three foot of each other.
1288660	1289660	Within three foot of me.
1289660	1290660	Exactly.
1290660	1291660	Practice what you preach.
1293660	1294660	I don't sunbathe.
1295660	1296660	That's breaking the law.
1296660	1297660	What's breaking the law?
1297660	1298660	Sunbathing.
1298660	1299660	Sunbathing?
1299660	1300660	Yeah, alright.
1300660	1301660	Look how covered I am.
1302660	1303660	Sunbathing.
1303660	1304660	I've got a hoodie.
1306660	1307660	She's reaching now.
1307660	1309660	She just wants to fuck this guy somehow.
1309660	1313660	She claims he's sunbathing when he's wearing a hoodie.
1313660	1314660	But still, you know what?
1314660	1318660	If you're social distancing and you decide to sunbathe,
1318660	1320660	whose fucking business is that?
1320660	1321660	Christ, man.
1321660	1323660	Yo, have a word with yourself.
1323660	1328660	A guideline is something that the government wants the people to do.
1328660	1330660	Thinks it would be in their best interest to do.
1330660	1333660	But that's not because there'll be punishments from the state if they don't do it.
1333660	1336660	It's because it's a good idea for themselves.
1336660	1339660	The police are not meant to enforce guidelines.
1339660	1341660	They're meant to enforce the law.
1341660	1342660	Oh, hey.
1342660	1346660	You want to watch them kick down random people's doors to see if there's parties going on?
1348660	1349660	Right.
1350660	1351660	Listen to us.
1351660	1352660	Hello?
1352660	1353660	We went to court, haven't we?
1353660	1354660	Because we went to court, but otherwise.
1354660	1355660	No.
1355660	1356660	There might be something going on in here, so.
1356660	1357660	You alright?
1357660	1358660	We need to double check.
1358660	1359660	What do you want?
1359660	1361660	I appreciate what you're saying about social distancing, so I'm keeping the distance.
1361660	1362660	Yeah?
1362660	1363660	Yeah, fuck off.
1363660	1365660	Right, so we need to check the group and make sure nothing's going on.
1365660	1366660	No, no, no.
1366660	1367660	Watch your name.
1367660	1368660	Stay away from me.
1368660	1369660	Watch your name.
1369660	1370660	Doesn't matter.
1370660	1371660	What are you doing in my house?
1371660	1372660	What are you doing in my house?
1372660	1373660	What are you doing in my house?
1373660	1374660	I just explained to you.
1374660	1375660	What are you doing in my house?
1375660	1376660	I just explained to you why we're here.
1376660	1377660	We've had to call them.
1377660	1378660	It's a disturbance.
1378660	1379660	That's why we're here.
1379660	1380660	What?
1380660	1381660	So you kicked my door in?
1381660	1383660	Should you have opened the door?
1383660	1384660	No.
1384660	1388660	So they kicked this guy's door down because they think there's a party going on, and now
1388660	1390660	they're just going to search his house.
1390660	1393660	This is, unironically, some fascist shit.
1393660	1398000	I know that that term's kind of been diluted recently because on the radical left side
1398000	1401240	of things, they call everything that's not them a fascist.
1401240	1405500	But the police ignoring people's property rights and simply walking around like they
1405500	1408600	own the place all the time, public or private land, doesn't matter?
1408600	1409600	Yeah, that's pretty fascist.
1409600	1410600	Can I explain that to you?
1410600	1411600	No!
1411600	1416600	I told you why I wouldn't open the door is because of what is going on with this virus.
1416600	1417600	Now, fuck off.
1417600	1418600	You can get out of here.
1418600	1419600	One time's satisfied.
1419600	1420600	You might have it.
1420600	1421600	Fucking no.
1421600	1422600	One time's satisfied.
1422600	1423600	Everything's all right.
1423600	1424600	No way.
1424600	1425600	Come on.
1425600	1426600	Get in here, dickhead.
1426600	1427600	Go on.
1428200	1429200	Have a look.
1429200	1430200	Just check it.
1430200	1431200	Have a look, dickhead.
1431200	1432200	All right.
1432200	1433760	See, you probably shouldn't have said, have a look, dickhead.
1433760	1437280	That can be construed as giving consent after the fact.
1437280	1439200	He should be objecting this whole fucking time.
1439200	1441660	But yeah, like, he refused to open the door.
1441660	1443200	They broke down the door.
1443200	1444460	Jesus.
1444460	1445760	There's no probable cause for this.
1445760	1446760	There's no fucking warrant.
1446760	1447760	Yeah.
1447760	1448760	Yeah.
1448760	1450760	No point only in here, is there?
1450760	1457080	So what do you mean putting me door through, fucking door?
1457560	1459560	You're fucking pathetic.
1459560	1461560	Get out of here.
1461560	1463560	You absolute disgrace.
1463560	1465560	And you've got nothing else to do.
1465560	1467560	You've put my fucking door through.
1467560	1469560	I hope you're going to fucking...
1469560	1473560	What are you going to fucking do to that?
1473560	1478560	Oh, shut your fucking mouth, you fucking brain dead cunt.
1478560	1479560	Get out.
1479560	1482560	Holy shit, dude.
1482560	1483560	I get it.
1483560	1484560	I get why he's mad.
1484560	1486560	It's legitimate, but it's just kind of funny to hear.
1487040	1490040	Fucking pay, what, 20 grand a year to be a fucking knobhead.
1490040	1491040	Fuck off.
1491040	1492040	Get out.
1492040	1494040	Am I fucking out?
1494040	1496040	Get the fuck out.
1496040	1497040	What are you?
1497040	1498040	Bye.
1498040	1499040	Bye.
1502040	1504040	Fucking idiots.
1504040	1506040	Broke me fucking door.
1506040	1510040	Look at the fucking state of this.
1510040	1512040	Huh?
1512040	1515040	British fucking police.
1515520	1518520	Look at the fucking state of it.
1518520	1521520	You fucking knobheads.
1521520	1525520	Fuck my life.
1525520	1526520	Holy shit, dude.
1526520	1528520	Yeah, they total his door.
1528520	1529520	He can't close it now.
1529520	1531520	He can't lock it now.
1531520	1532520	Now he's going to get robbed.
1532520	1536520	Oh, and by the way, some places have publicly said that they just don't have the manpower
1536520	1538520	to stop robberies anymore.
1538520	1541520	So if someone's robbing you and you call the police, they just can't show up.
1541520	1544520	Great time to leave somebody with no fucking door then.
1545000	1550760	With techs doing their part too, landing AI has developed a tool that ensures people keep
1550760	1552040	their social distance.
1552040	1556640	The green blocks are people who have kept social distance and the red blocks are people
1556640	1557740	who aren't.
1557740	1563600	And you can see on the bird's eye view where the red blocks are too close to some people.
1563600	1565040	Thanks big tech.
1565040	1569360	Now the police can just monitor every street and give everyone tickets all the fucking
1569360	1570360	time.
1570360	1572000	Google's getting in on it too.
1572000	1575800	Google's sharing Canadian's location data with the government, but says the privacy
1575800	1576800	is assured.
1576800	1579720	How is the privacy assured if you're sharing it with the government?
1579720	1581120	It's already been shared.
1581120	1584600	Let's see what they're actually implementing in all of these locations.
1584600	1588120	These are the fines you can get in Toronto and Ontario for coronavirus right now.
1588120	1593380	Residents of Toronto are required to follow the newly implemented social distancing by-law.
1593380	1597580	The by-law requires any two people who don't live together to keep two meters of distance
1597580	1600640	between them and a park or public square.
1600800	1606080	Anyone who fails to comply with the new by-law can receive a maximum set fine of $1,000.
1606080	1611160	Police officers across Ontario are enforcing provincial orders banning organized social
1611160	1616120	gatherings of more than five people as well as bans on using closed playgrounds in other
1616120	1617120	parks.
1617120	1621320	The city is also issuing fines to non-essential businesses that remain open despite provincial
1621320	1622720	orders to shut down.
1622720	1626000	In London, go engulfing on that $750 fine.
1626000	1631280	Doesn't matter if the course is closed and therefore empty and therefore no one is
1631280	1634320	getting infected, $750.
1634320	1641040	The city of Laredo, Texas has mandated that people wear masks in public or face a $1,000
1641040	1642040	fine.
1642040	1647360	The fines for not complying with social distancing rules in Vancouver is also $1,000.
1647360	1650000	For businesses, it's $50,000.
1650000	1655320	Fifty-nine charges have already been laid in Hamilton, including against seven businesses.
1655320	1661600	Hamilton has 331 cases and 16 deaths, while its population is half a million.
1661600	1665120	Let's see if these various new restrictions are bearing any fruit.
1665120	1671280	First, UK arrest for failing to self-isolate over the coronavirus as man at 26 is held
1671280	1672600	on the Isle of Man.
1672600	1679640	A 26-year-old male faces a 10,000-pound fine and three months in jail after arriving on
1679640	1683400	the Isle of Man then refusing to go into a 14-day quarantine.
1683400	1687500	The Quebec City Police arrest a coronavirus patient for defying her quarantine.
1687500	1690120	She tested positive but was still going around town.
1690120	1695560	A coronavirus patient is now under 24-7 armed guard after refusing to self-isolate.
1695560	1699680	The governor of the state of Kentucky had to make this decision because the person just
1699680	1701080	would not stay indoors.
1701080	1705160	Now, I kind of get it when it's somebody who's actually been confirmed to have the
1705160	1708960	virus, but it's happening to just random people, too.
1708960	1714960	In the UK, a woman was wrongly charged £660 under a new coronavirus law.
1714960	1720480	Two women in Texas were arrested for offering home beauty and salon services out of their
1720480	1721480	house.
1721480	1726280	They were in fact discovered by undercover cops who posed as customers.
1726280	1732120	Six people were shot at a California house party that violated the stay-at-home order.
1732120	1734320	The victims were five adults and one juvenile.
1734360	1741560	A driver-in-training was fined $1600 for non-essential travel during the coronavirus lockdown.
1741560	1747920	It really does seem like they're going after everybody, but actually it's not everybody.
1747920	1753000	The police let a wedding with 30 guests and a drummer go ahead in Melbourne despite a
1753000	1759320	ban on ceremonies with more than five guests, just telling them to keep 1.5 metres apart.
1759320	1760720	Check out this wedding picture, guys.
1760720	1764280	I mean, you think there might be something about this as to why they're not enforcing
1764280	1765280	the rules equally?
1765280	1768680	You think it's just random chance or you think something might be going on here?
1768680	1770720	I don't know.
1770720	1775760	A French official says the quarantine should not be enforced in migrant areas to avoid
1775760	1776760	riots.
1776760	1779360	It's not a priority to enforce closings in certain neighbourhoods.
1779360	1780840	Is that all it takes?
1780840	1783480	In order for us to get our rights back, all we have to do is riot?
1783480	1784780	Really, is that it?
1784780	1787160	Or maybe it's just riot while not being white.
1787160	1789720	There are two headlines, though, that are absolutely insane.
1789720	1791900	We should blow up the bridges.
1791900	1794520	Coronavirus leads to class warfare in Hamptons.
1794520	1797160	I guess they don't want people coming to town.
1797160	1799240	And check out this Nazi shit.
1799240	1804960	Montana County demands people wear government-issued armbands to do business.
1804960	1805960	Wow.
1805960	1811040	You literally have to have your papers, not just your papers, but your Nazi armband in
1811040	1813800	order to buy and sell in this area.
1813800	1816920	This flyer was given to all the businesses in the area.
1816920	1819960	Did you see a pink wristband in Valley County?
1819960	1821360	What does it mean?
1821360	1825760	Anyone who is from out of town or out of Valley County who has a pink wristband has been here
1825760	1829700	14 days or more, and no longer needs to do the strict self-quarantine.
1829700	1832060	They may enter your business.
1832060	1836720	Anyone who is from out of town or out of Valley County, staying here or working here, and
1836720	1842200	has not completed the 14-day quarantine is required by the Valley County Health Officer
1842200	1845680	Order to use curbside delivery only.
1845680	1849000	They are not to enter your business to shop.
1849000	1852880	Someone working on each shift must talk to the people and insist that they follow the
1852880	1853880	orders.
1853880	1858920	If, after explaining the requirements, the person doesn't comply, you are to call law
1858920	1859960	enforcement.
1859960	1863000	This is probably the most draconian thing to come out of this so far.
1863000	1866480	Of course, the internet knows exactly how to strike back against this kind of nonsense.
1866480	1869240	Like when New York City's mayor put this up.
1869240	1872400	How do you report places that aren't enforcing social distancing?
1872400	1873400	It's simple.
1873400	1876120	Snap a photo and text it to 311692.
1876120	1880200	Well, no one's surprised that this happened, right?
1880200	1886160	de Blasio's social distancing tip line was flooded with penis photos and Hitler memes.
1886160	1887680	Thank you 4chan.
1887680	1892600	Mayor Bill de Blasio's critics let him know how they really felt about him, ordering New
1892600	1896440	Yorkers to snitch on each other for violating social distancing rules.
1896440	1902320	By flooding his new tip line with crank complaints including dick pics and people flipping the
1902320	1908280	bird, photos of extended middle fingers, the mayor dropping the Staten Island groundhog,
1908280	1913160	and news coverage of him going to the gym have all been texted to a special tip line
1913160	1916440	that de Blasio announced Saturday.
1916440	1922600	Fuck you, replied Morden L. Schmidt 1, along with a meme showing Adolf Hitler and the words,
1922600	1927060	To those turning in your neighbors and local businesses, you did the right thing.
1927060	1932000	Other profane messages included a photo of a bowl of gummy candies in the shape of many
1932000	1941480	male genitalia and a sign saying eat a bag of dicks.
1941480	1947200	He looked at me and coofed in my direction, the caller said, according to a photo of the
1947200	1949920	311 operator's computer screen.
1949920	1956720	Coof is a newly coined term for coughing while infected with the coronavirus.
1956720	1961560	I love it when like old style media tries to report on memes.
1961560	1966420	It's been hilarious shit for years man, even going back to the whole exploding van, lulls
1966420	1971160	is a corruption of lol, kinda stuff that we saw from Fox News in like 2007 or whatever
1971160	1972160	it was.
1972160	1976240	And yes, at this point they actually are mask off tyrants.
1976240	1982520	Michigan governor considers extending the coronavirus restrictions because of the protesters.
1982520	1986880	Not for any other reason, not because Michigan for some reason needs it, not for any kind
1986880	1991380	of health or economic reason or whatever, just because people protested.
1991380	1995620	This is very much like a one more word from you mister and you're on the ground for another
1995620	1996980	3 months kind of deal.
1996980	2002180	And I'm not at all surprised because the democratic governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, actually
2002180	2003180	looks like a Karen.
2003180	2009380	It's that kind of irresponsible action that puts us in this situation where we might have
2009380	2014540	to actually think about extending stay home orders, which is supposedly what they were
2014540	2015540	protesting.
2015540	2017260	Thanks mom, I hate it.
2017260	2021100	And some people really are crying out for the government to be their parent, to swoop
2021100	2026160	in and save them and coddle them and restrict them the way that a parent would.
2026160	2030300	To beat this coronavirus we must sacrifice our freedoms.
2030300	2036900	South Korea, China, Singapore and Taiwan have demonstrated that draconian methods like tracking
2036900	2040180	people with technology work.
2040180	2041180	Have they?
2041180	2044860	Because we all know that China's cooking the numbers, and we've seen a natural decline
2044860	2050420	in the acceleration of cases all over the world, whether or not they actually used draconian
2050420	2051420	methods.
2051420	2057060	This disease is so infectious, governments must unleash the big brother bazooka by deploying
2057060	2058140	technology.
2058140	2061020	This is the only way to fully halt the contagion.
2061020	2063940	Testing must be universal and mandatory.
2063940	2069300	Smartphones and other devices can help authorities monitor people's movements in order to enforce
2069300	2072220	social distancing and prevent them from gathering.
2072220	2076700	Data on the movements of those who are quarantined or known to be infected can help authorities
2076700	2079300	track down who's been exposed.
2079300	2082960	Infected Koreans are separated from their family and friends and put into government
2082960	2085020	isolation shelters.
2085020	2089520	Their phone and credit card data is used by health authorities to trace their movements
2089520	2091800	and contacts.
2091800	2096500	Every contact or person in the vicinity of their journeys is sent a warning on their
2096500	2102340	phones and told they must quarantine themselves at home, where they are monitored by a GPS
2102340	2103340	app.
2103340	2105540	If they leave home, they face huge fines.
2105540	2111340	The Chinese require anyone who's tested positive, is isolated or has been exposed to victims
2111340	2116380	to download software on their smartphones that allows police to access a colour code
2116380	2120280	that defines their health status and whether they should be in quarantine or free to use
2120280	2121760	public spaces.
2121760	2124300	These measures are not overkill.
2124300	2128380	Canadians are mostly compliant, but many need more discipline.
2128380	2133980	We've all seen reckless people on beaches and parks, oblivious to the wellbeing of others.
2133980	2138740	Many are refusing to stay home, keep their distance from others or are gathering privately.
2138740	2144140	All of these people are potential spreaders, or as one headline labelled them, Covidiots.
2144140	2150900	Laws with fines and punishments already exist but aren't working, nor is public shaming.
2150900	2154820	Using Canadians using technology will keep everyone honest.
2154820	2160360	Skittishness about privacy or freedom are valid concerns, but the status quo dictates
2160360	2163300	that extraordinary action must be undertaken.
2163300	2167900	This also means truly sealing our borders until the crisis is over.
2167900	2173240	The fact is that freedom is the right to swing your arm, but not to hit anyone with it.
2173240	2178280	And privacy is a cherished privilege, but only if it causes no harm.
2178280	2180600	This is the socialist paradise.
2180600	2185820	This is what every young leftist has been screaming about wanting for the past decade.
2185820	2190960	Capitalism has been broken, at least temporarily, replaced by state control of everything.
2190960	2193880	Freedoms are curtailed for, supposedly, the greater good.
2193880	2197080	Earning your own money has been replaced with government handouts.
2197080	2202320	The newly 18 year old socialists were promised paradise, but the realities of this level
2202320	2204820	of government control are actually quite bleak.
2204820	2210160	The left has been saying for a while now that they could actually create utopia on earth,
2210160	2214600	as long as the average person simply surrendered their basic rights to government control and
2214600	2217640	accepted the nationalization of everything.
2217640	2219440	And here we are.
2219440	2223920	Governments around the world, both autocratic and democratic, have begun to seize power
2223920	2226320	and issue authoritarian crackdowns.
2226320	2230060	Who knows how many of them will actually give up all of this emergency authority once the
2230060	2232580	coronavirus crisis has run its course.
2232580	2236720	Our cities now have an extra police presence, sometimes even an extra military presence
2236720	2237720	in them.
2237720	2242760	That force will be wielded by the same people that have closed our schools, our businesses,
2242760	2247720	our churches, our public spaces, our gyms, our libraries, and our clubs.
2247720	2253120	We still don't know just how far they're willing to go in using that military force to try
2253120	2255120	to keep people off the streets.
2255120	2261120	But we are being asked by both the state, and frankly, the dumber segments of our population,
2261120	2265680	to simply accept it, and to hope that the people in charge come good on their promise
2265680	2267780	to give our civil liberties back.
2267780	2269120	It's not all bad.
2269120	2272680	It is true that there are definitely some civil servants out there who are acting out
2272680	2277760	of a genuine, urgent need to keep people safe right now during a crisis.
2277760	2282540	But there's just as many hidden authoritarians that are salivating at the prospect of keeping
2282540	2284240	people in their place.
2284240	2285520	Don't let them do it.
2285520	2286520	Protest.
2286520	2289680	And protest doesn't mean go out there and get into violent brawls with the cops or throw
2289680	2292840	a brick at them or something, because then it becomes a riot.
2292840	2295640	Then you've actually broken the law and done something wrong.
2295640	2297800	Still protesting means that you're willing to get arrested.
2297800	2300000	It means that you're potentially willing to have a record.
2300000	2304060	Say what you want about Bernie Sanders, but those old pictures of him being dragged away
2304060	2308360	by the cops because he was peacefully protesting in what he believed?
2308360	2312440	That is the kind of thing that you have to do right now, if protest is your aim.
2312440	2314640	You have to be willing to spend a night or two in jail.
2314640	2318160	But as long as you don't forfeit the high ground, it will probably be better for you
2318160	2319160	in the end.
2319160	2321960	A couple months ago on this channel I was talking about how it was probably a good idea
2321960	2322960	to shut things down.
2323160	2325720	And I actually still agree with that because the whole point of shutting society down,
2325720	2330480	at least temporarily, and using federal power to grant that authority, it's not because
2330480	2332480	there's a coronavirus pandemic.
2332480	2337720	It's because there's a pandemic of an unknown virus that we have no idea how to combat.
2337720	2340120	But now we do, at least somewhat.
2340120	2341280	We have some ideas.
2341280	2342680	We know a little bit more about it.
2342680	2346680	Shutting things down was meant to buy us time so that we could actually study this virus,
2346680	2349300	learn what was going on with it, and figure out what to do about it.
2349300	2351040	We are largely at that stage.
2351080	2354480	We don't have a vaccine yet, but we do have some effective treatments.
2354480	2359440	Our manufacturing capacity has ramped up again, such that the shortages of masks and ventilators,
2359440	2363020	as well as stuff like food and toilet paper, has largely gone away.
2363020	2366960	Now is the time to open back up, because we've figured out what to do about it and now we
2366960	2367960	can do it.
2367960	2370960	And there is no good reason to stay indoors anymore.
2370960	2376220	Even if there is this dreaded second wave, dealing with the second wave is better than
2376220	2377840	giving up our rights.
2377840	2381880	Because if those rights are actually gone, they're gone for everyone, not just people
2381880	2384860	who are infected, and they could be gone for a generation.
2384860	2388000	We are actually living in the socialist paradise.
2388000	2393060	It is no wonder that not only does nobody like it, but that governments around the world
2393060	2398680	are turning into, at various speeds, the exact type of thing that we need to prevent.
2408340	2411340	All humans must keep indoors.
2411340	2416340	All humans must go by the lights, by order of the direct.
2417840	2420340	All humans must keep indoors.
2420340	2425840	All humans must go by the lights, by order of the direct.
