1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
We are now living in a socialist paradise.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,600
No, really.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,600
Industries are closing down, capitalism is being replaced by Trump bucks, Trudeau bucks, Boris bucks.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,700
We're living simpler lives, less travel, way fewer carbon emissions,

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,500
governments are nationalizing and taking over everything.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,000
This is what the far left has been advocating for for years.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
How do you like it?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,200
How does it feel that you can no longer freely consent to enter into employment with somebody,

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,800
to negotiate for a wage in a field you're interested in,

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,300
and instead you simply have to stay home and take what you're given?

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,700
How does it feel that you can no longer go outside?

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,400
That those roads, those parks, those schools and libraries that you pay tax money for,

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,700
you can no longer use?

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,300
How does it feel with all private business shut down?

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Because the state has decided that free people can no longer engage in commerce.

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,500
How do you like the socialist paradise?

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,100
This is a document that Naomi's been given by her workplace

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,800
that basically identifies her as an essential worker.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,200
She works at a grocery store.

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,700
Canada is not yet at the level where we're checking people's papers.

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,600
But various essential businesses have been giving these out anyway, just in case.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,400
Some countries are a lot worse with it.

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,800
Here's one from France.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,800
It basically says that in order to leave your house,

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,400
you have to fill this out and give it to the police.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,300
It outlines who you are, where you live, and where you're going.

27
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,600
Here's Italy's form.

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
Pretty much the same thing.

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,900
What kind of free society asks you for your papers just so you can travel?

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,500
It's not just papers, though.

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,800
Westwood Bar boarded up by police after continuing to serve food and drinks indoors.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,400
I mean, it's stupid.

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,200
But what's the problem?

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,700
It's people's choice.

35
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,600
If idiots want to go there and get sick, isn't that their prerogative?

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,300
Isn't it on the individual to be responsible and manage their own life?

37
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:46,200
On Monday night, Queen City Lounge had 40 customers inside drinking and eating from a full buffet.

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,900
On Tuesday afternoon, several arrests later, police boarded the place up.

39
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,400
The Westwood Bar had continued to operate as usual,

40
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,600
despite Ohio Governor Mike DeWine's order that all restaurants and bars in the state of Ohio

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,900
end their dine-in services to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,900
It was more than a risk to patrons, the police chief added.

43
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,000
Now you're putting first responders at risk because we get the information that they're open.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,600
There's 40-plus people inside.

45
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,700
Who knows who may have already come into contact with coronavirus,

46
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,900
and now our first responders are having to interact with those folks.

47
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,000
It wasn't the first warning the Queen City Lounge had received.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,700
It pains us to have to do this.

49
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,000
It pains us that we are in these uncharted waters.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,500
This is new territory for your police department.

51
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,700
What new territory? Being authoritarians?

52
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,500
Yes, I agree with you. It's stupid that they're still open.

53
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,300
It's stupid that people are congregating there.

54
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,400
But are you actually saying that people don't have the right to be stupid?

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,400
It's not good for them to be stupid, but should the government prevent them from being?

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,900
Is safety a more important value than freedom?

57
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,100
Is that where we are now?

58
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,800
Well, this is where that kind of thinking goes.

59
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,400
Rhode Island police to hunt down New Yorkers seeking refuge.

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,200
Cars are stopped, homes to be checked to enforce quarantines.

61
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Officers halt cars on the interstate to start the crackdown.

62
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,800
What's going on here is that the state of New York is seriously suffering from coronavirus,

63
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,200
far worse than most of the rest of the United States.

64
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,500
And so people who have a New York license plate on their vehicles,

65
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,000
but are driving to Rhode Island to get away from it,

66
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
are going to be rounded up by the Rhode Island police.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
This is the type of totalitarian nightmare you get

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,400
when safety is a higher virtue than freedom.

69
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,500
The state can justify violating all sorts of rights

70
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,900
if it views it to be in the person's best interest.

71
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,700
And if the state's view of what your best interest is

72
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,300
comes into conflict with your right of self-determination,

73
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,500
well, fuck you then.

74
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,300
Yesterday I announced, and today I reiterated,

75
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,000
anyone coming to Rhode Island in any way from New York must be quarantined,

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
the governor said.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,100
By order, will be enforced, enforceable by law.

78
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,000
She signed an executive order Thursday that applies to anyone

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,500
who has been in New York during the past two weeks,

80
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,700
and through at least April 25th.

81
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,900
National Guard members will be stationed at the T.F. Green Airport,

82
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,700
Amtrak train stations, and at bus stops.

83
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,600
The citizen soldiers will be following up with people at local residences.

84
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,700
The maximum penalty for not complying is a fine of $500 and 90 days in prison.

85
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,400
The American Civil Liberties Union blasted the new rules,

86
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,600
objecting to the collection of the motorist contact information in particular.

87
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,400
While the governor may have the power to suspend some state laws and regulations

88
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,400
to address this medical emergency, she cannot suspend the constitution.

89
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,800
Under the Fourth Amendment, having a New York state license plate

90
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,500
simply does not, and cannot, constitute probable cause

91
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
to allow police to stop a car and interrogate the driver,

92
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,700
no matter how laudable the goal of the stop may be.

93
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,800
And they're absolutely right.

94
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,200
The ACLU has been kind of hit and miss recently,

95
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,400
but this is absolutely the case.

96
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,900
People's natural rights do not vanish just because of an emergency,

97
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,700
and you can tell exactly which politicians have always been authoritarians in waiting,

98
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,900
based on how they're responding to this crisis.

99
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,100
Speaking of citizen soldiers,

100
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,300
this would not be a complete video if we didn't watch all the various snitches that are floating around right now.

101
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,200
Let's check it out.

102
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,600
You're a little pop, seriously? Seriously, I called the cops.

103
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,400
I can't watch.

104
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,200
I'm so scared. I'm so scared.

105
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,400
Shouldn't she be social distancing from them?

106
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,900
They closed the window on her, dude. She's spitting all over the place.

107
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,100
Like seriously, what's going on here? The road is empty.

108
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,300
These are just two kids driving around in the car.

109
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,000
They're not doing anything. They're not exposing anybody to coronavirus.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,100
Like they leave their house, they hop in the car, they drive around,

111
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,300
they go back to their house, they go back inside.

112
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,600
Just to get, just to get the fuck out for a minute or two.

113
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,000
And you have these moral busybodies who just can't wait to get you in trouble

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,600
because they have nothing else going on in their pathetic lives.

115
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
This one looks like it's from the UK, just based on the signs and what they're wearing

116
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,300
and some of the stuff that's on the road, but we'll see.

117
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,300
Hi guys.

118
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,600
Hello.

119
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,300
Do you work for the NHS?

120
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,500
Uh, no.

121
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,800
Who do you work for?

122
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,300
For community fibre.

123
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,300
So what are you laying?

124
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,100
Fibre.

125
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,000
Fibre. What kind of fibre?

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
Fibre optic, 5G ones.

127
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,100
But you're not supposed to be within two metres of each other

128
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,600
and you're supposed to be essential. Is this essential work?

129
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Uh, I think so. I don't know.

130
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,100
He just sent me to do the job and I just can't.

131
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,900
Dude, they're laying 5G fibre optic cable.

132
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,200
They're causing the coronavirus.

133
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,600
I understand it's not essential and you don't work for the NHS.

134
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
So why are you doing it?

135
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
Does it not negate the government's guidelines?

136
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,900
Yeah, if you want to make a complaint.

137
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,200
Who do I complain to? Who's your boss?

138
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Uh, I have a number for the courtesy board.

139
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,700
Where is the white van and the red barriers.

140
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
If you want to call.

141
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,700
But do you know what you're doing now? You're laying 5G.

142
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
Yeah.

143
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,700
You realise that, don't you?

144
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,200
Yeah.

145
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,700
Yeah?

146
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,200
Yeah.

147
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
So what, do you know that kills people?

148
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
You know, I said that as a joke.

149
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
I didn't know she was actually going to go there.

150
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
They turn this on, it's going to kill everyone

151
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
and that's why they're building the hospitals?

152
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Yep.

153
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,700
How do you feel? Do you have children?

154
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,200
No, I'm young.

155
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
Do you have parents?

156
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Just my mum.

157
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,200
Well, how do you feel when they turn that switch on?

158
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Bye-bye, mama.

159
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Holy shit, lady.

160
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Like, let him get on with his fucking work, dude.

161
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,700
If you want to complain, call his head office.

162
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,700
Like, okay, I've done this kind of work before.

163
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,200
Not laying 5G, obviously, but you know, this kind of,

164
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,200
you're out in the streets and you're doing public service work.

165
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
And we were always told,

166
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,200
listen, if someone has a complaint about the labourer's work,

167
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
they call the head office, they call the town hall,

168
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,700
they call the public works office.

169
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,700
They don't try to get us to stop it,

170
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,700
because even though our salaries were funded by taxes,

171
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
an individual member of the public doesn't have the right

172
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
to liaison directly with an individual worker.

173
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
That's not how the system works.

174
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
There are ways you can complain and change things,

175
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,700
but not by harassing a low-level worker.

176
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,700
We'll all be in hospital on breathing apparatus.

177
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,700
Why do you think they're building 25,000

178
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,700
sort of concentration camps of death?

179
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,700
Are hospitals concentration camps now?

180
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Holy shit.

181
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
They called those camps at the border concentration camps.

182
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,700
I'm pretty sure that they were places to detain people

183
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,700
before they deport them, not places that they put people to keep them in.

184
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
They were throwing them out.

185
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,700
But listen, like, just because the state has to put people somewhere

186
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,700
because of some reason, many of which are legitimate,

187
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,700
doesn't mean that it's a concentration camp.

188
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Video. Americans being forced to take the coronavirus test.

189
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,700
This can't be good.

190
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,700
Please leave me alone.

191
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,700
Please leave me alone.

192
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,700
Please leave me alone.

193
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,700
Please leave me alone.

194
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Please leave me alone, bro.

195
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
Not until you get on the bed.

196
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
I'm not getting on the bed.

197
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
Man, help me out, bro.

198
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,700
It doesn't work like that, bro.

199
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Can anybody know a lawyer, bro?

200
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Somebody sent me a lawyer.

201
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,700
No, no, no!

202
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,700
It don't work like that, man.

203
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,700
This shit ain't right, man.

204
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Nah, don't put the phone down now, motherfucker.

205
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,700
Now, bro, leave me alone.

206
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
I don't want to leave it on my own.

207
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
It don't work like that.

208
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,700
It does not work like that, bro.

209
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
No, no.

210
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,700
Y'all need to change mental health awareness.

211
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,700
Mental health help.

212
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Man, no.

213
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
No, man.

214
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
No, no.

215
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
The time is now.

216
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
The time is now.

217
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
No.

218
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
I'm not on drugs.

219
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
None of that, bro.

220
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,700
I'm insane.

221
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,700
I'm insane, man.

222
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Y'all don't want this crazy.

223
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Y'all don't want this crazy, bro.

224
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
No.

225
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,700
No.

226
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,700
Uh-uh.

227
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,700
No.

228
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
Bro, get your motherfucking hands off me, bro.

229
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
It don't work like this, bro.

230
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
I would tear this bitch up, nigga, on my mother, nigga.

231
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,700
Get off of me.

232
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Get off me, bro.

233
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,700
It don't work like that.

234
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,700
I'm not crazy.

235
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
You crazy, right, man?

236
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
Leave me alone, bro.

237
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Yeah, you did.

238
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
I'm not scared of nothing, bro.

239
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
I'm not scared of nothing, bro.

240
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Please leave me the fuck alone, bro.

241
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
It don't work like that, bro.

242
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Come on.

243
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,700
Get off me.

244
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,700
Holy shit.

245
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
Y'all weak as a bitch.

246
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,700
Right here.

247
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,700
J, come on.

248
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
Come on, bro.

249
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Come on.

250
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Stop.

251
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,700
Stop.

252
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
Hey.

253
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,700
You're choking me.

254
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,700
You're choking me.

255
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
You're choking me, bro.

256
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,700
Stop.

257
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,700
You're choking me, bro.

258
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Uh-uh.

259
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,700
Stop.

260
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
Help.

261
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,700
Stop.

262
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Help, man.

263
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,700
This shit ain't right, bro.

264
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,700
Stop.

265
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
Stop.

266
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Stop.

267
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Stop.

268
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,700
This shit ain't right.

269
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,700
Aah.

270
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
Aah.

271
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
Aah.

272
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Aah.

273
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Aah, motherfucker.

274
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
All right.

275
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,700
It's going to be a revolution now.

276
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
Y'all already know what's ahead of the story.

277
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Y'all have to get it into motion.

278
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Yeah.

279
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Jesus Christ.

280
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:59,960
Okay, so I understand the necessity of testing people for a novel new disease, but it's my

281
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,940
understanding that not only human rights, but medical ethics dictate that until someone

282
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:12,500
falls unconscious, if they are actively refusing treatment, you can't treat them?

283
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,860
This seems wildly unethical.

284
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,180
Like, you always hear about people who, like, they're overdosing on drugs and they're like,

285
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,740
no, man, I don't want treatment, I just want to die.

286
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,020
And the paramedics are there.

287
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,540
And they have to wait for the person to fall unconscious before they can start treating

288
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,780
them because they are explicitly not consenting.

289
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,700
But these people, they just don't fucking care.

290
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,380
It's disgusting.

291
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,380
I've seen this one a few times, but check this shit out, guys.

292
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,660
This is some South American country.

293
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,300
They have squads of people in hazmat suits running around, just chasing down anyone they

294
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,020
see in public.

295
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,580
If you catch somebody, you lock them up.

296
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,620
I think this video is from Massachusetts.

297
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,100
A church here is doing a drive-in method of holding services.

298
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,260
The idea being that I guess they all sit in their cars and they give the service?

299
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
I'm not sure.

300
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,100
Let's see what happens.

301
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Look at this, y'all.

302
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,140
All these, they heard through the grapevine we're having service at 6.30.

303
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,700
And there's more police cars at a church service.

304
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,860
Yes, this is King James Bible Baptist Church where Pastor Hamilton, where I'm the pastor

305
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,140
of the church at.

306
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,820
This is America, private property of a church.

307
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,820
Look at this, y'all.

308
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,820
There's more police pulling up.

309
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
They ain't done.

310
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Yes, sir.

311
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,020
I got a letter from my lawyer, too.

312
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,020
You want to read my letter from my lawyer?

313
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,900
Okay, I'm good.

314
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,900
I got that.

315
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
I know.

316
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
I know about it.

317
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Yes, sir.

318
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
Yes, sir.

319
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Yes, sir.

320
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
Yes, sir.

321
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
We're going to get tickets.

322
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,900
Yes, sir.

323
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Yes.

324
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Yes, sir.

325
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Yes, sir.

326
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
Yes, sir.

327
00:12:46,900 --> 00:13:02,260
No, the government, our right don't come from authority.

328
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,580
It comes from the Bible.

329
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,100
So the authority does not have the right over the Constitution.

330
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
We're talking about the constitutional law.

331
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,660
The first Second Amendment, the U.S. Constitution that was given to us by our forefather, Tate

332
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,500
Reid can't take it away, Eric Simmons can't take it away, nor the police officer.

333
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
It be suspended.

334
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,500
It can't.

335
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
By the military.

336
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
No, it can't.

337
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,740
Hey, look at this, y'all.

338
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,940
I'm a good citizen here.

339
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
I don't sell drugs.

340
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,940
Look at the police.

341
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,300
At least I'm as a pastor.

342
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,620
I got a police officer here, y'all, like I'm commending, like I'm robbing or I can kill

343
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,620
somebody.

344
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,620
This is what you...

345
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,460
They don't have this when a murderer is in Greenville, y'all.

346
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,660
Listen to these fucking pigs, dude.

347
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,660
Your rights are suspended.

348
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,340
Yeah, bullshit they are.

349
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:44,000
Natural rights can never be suspended, and the American Constitution is not suspended

350
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,580
because of a pandemic.

351
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,460
Multiple pandemics have happened throughout American history.

352
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,580
The Constitution was never suspended.

353
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,740
There is no mechanism by which it can be suspended in that way for that reason.

354
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,460
Fuck these power hungry tyrants.

355
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,700
Here's one from Philadelphia.

356
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
Yo, man, what are you saying, man?

357
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,660
That's orange, y'all.

358
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,660
What the fuck am I holding on to?

359
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,660
Yo, you gonna feel this, man?

360
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
Look what the fuck y'all are pulling on me, y'all, man.

361
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
Get the fuck off me.

362
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
Yeah.

363
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
Get the fuck off my fucking legs.

364
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,660
This man's crime was not wearing a mask on a bus.

365
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,660
That's it.

366
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,660
He wasn't causing a scene.

367
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,160
He wasn't coughing on anyone's face.

368
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,660
He wasn't spitting on them.

369
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,660
He was just sitting there without a mask.

370
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,660
Wouldn't it have been easier just to just give him a mask?

371
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,660
If you do not have a mask, you cannot ride public transportation, sir.

372
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,660
Sir.

373
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,660
You have to get off the bus, you have to get off the bus.

374
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Sir.

375
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,660
Sir.

376
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Let's go.

377
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,660
You gotta get off the bus, man.

378
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,660
I'm gonna have the cops take you off, one or the other.

379
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
You have to get off.

380
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,660
You have to get off.

381
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,660
You have to get off.

382
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,660
Let's go.

383
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,660
I have to get off?

384
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
Yes, sir.

385
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,660
You don't have no mask.

386
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,660
Let's go.

387
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,660
Let's go.

388
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,660
You gotta get off.

389
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,660
Let's go.

390
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
Let's go.

391
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,660
You gotta get off.

392
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
Fuck you.

393
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,660
You pay your taxes, you pay that fare, you're fucking entitled to it.

394
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,660
He was throwing people off who, like, they couldn't afford masks or couldn't find them, obviously.

395
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,660
They were wearing bandanas, they were putting stuff around their mouth, they were doing whatever they could.

396
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660
And this guy's just a little fucking weasel.

397
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,660
If you really want to know how these people think, all you have to do is look at this short exchange.

398
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:52,660
We are aware of the reopened North Carolina protest that is occurring in downtown Raleigh on Wilmington and Jones Street and are monitoring the situation.

399
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,660
The protesters are in violation of the governor's executive order and have been asked to leave.

400
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,660
What part of the governor's order was violated here?

401
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,660
Protesting is a non-essential activity.

402
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,660
Protesting is the most essential activity.

403
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,660
The people have an inalienable right to petition the government for a redress of their grievances.

404
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,660
This does not go away just because there's an emergency.

405
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,660
It is you corrupt little shits that are non-essential.

406
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,660
It's not just America having this problem, obviously.

407
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:25,660
And it comes as a man was charged in Sydney after going for a swim at Bondi Beach, seen being pinned to the ground by police.

408
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:31,660
The 54-year-old man allegedly ignored signs that the beach was closed, entering a sectioned-off area.

409
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,660
I didn't break any law, I didn't climb any fences, I didn't do anything at all.

410
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,660
I was, I had to swim, I had to swim off the rocks.

411
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:48,660
That police can do something to absolutely model citizen, law-abiding citizen, who never had treat me like absolute animal.

412
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:57,660
Some eastern suburbs beaches will reopen today for exercise, including Coogee, Maroubra and Clavelli, but sunbathing is still banned.

413
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,660
Look at that beach, dude. There's no one there.

414
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,660
Like, if you show up and you, you know, you flaunt the rules a little bit, you take a dip.

415
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Are you spreading coronavirus? Are you poisoning the ocean with it or something?

416
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,660
If people social distance at the beach, if they social distance while sunbathing or whatever, then whose business is it?

417
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,660
This one's from the UK. I already know it's going to be crazy.

418
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,660
I'm picking up the plan at the same time.

419
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:26,660
But you were just stood, I wasn't stood here and come out because you was, I was come out because you were stood there saying, talking about is this needed and all that.

420
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,660
That's why I've come out.

421
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,660
No, no way. Give me a ticket for what?

422
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
For six hundred and six.

423
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
Give me a ticket for what?

424
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660
You're a board guy.

425
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,660
Are you going to give me an eight out or just lock you up?

426
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,660
Lock me up for what?

427
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
Breaking Covid guy, lads.

428
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,660
Listen, put your hands on your head.

429
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,660
Put your hands on your head.

430
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,660
What?

431
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Am I being threatened? Am I being threatened?

432
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,660
You got a bored, lazy police officer just harassing people for the sheer fucking fun of it.

433
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,660
Here's where things start to get crazy.

434
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,660
This guy's getting harassed for walking his dog.

435
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,660
The police just stroll up and ask him for his papers.

436
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,660
Look at me when I'm on the chat, well you're just a bit rude, innit?

437
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,660
Come on, I'm trying to educate you here and you're just looking at your phone, alright?

438
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,660
I don't want to find you sixty pounds, I'm making my way around Denver before you say something.

439
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,660
Educate you? Like it's the state's place to tell you what to fucking think.

440
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,660
When I seen you lot walking around in a group just then, walking all together, not even masks, you're all stood within six feet of me.

441
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
You want to buy me a mask, yeah?

442
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,660
You're all within six, you're all within six feet.

443
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:43,660
It's not his job to buy you a mask, that's your job. In fact, you have a job still, this guy probably doesn't have one.

444
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:50,660
Right, okay, so while you practice what you preach, yeah I know, you should be filming anyway, you should be filming anyway.

445
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,660
Don't put it on YouTube because my identity is not allowed on YouTube.

446
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,660
Oh.

447
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,660
Hahahaha.

448
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,660
Well, if you want to cross the ocean and try to get me to take the video down, go right the fuck ahead, lady.

449
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,660
Isn't it? 2297, what's your name please?

450
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,660
Sainsbury.

451
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,660
Thank you.

452
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,660
What's your name please?

453
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,660
I'm not going to give it to you, am I?

454
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,660
Well, I actually ended so close, you have to do this.

455
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,660
No, I don't.

456
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,660
I'm actually doing it the best, because I'm actually going to put you down for fine, for being out unnecessarily.

457
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,660
Look at this, he just didn't want to interact with her.

458
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:26,660
And so she's going to be like, uh, nope, now you have to tell me everything about you, even though there's no fucking probable cause.

459
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
Well, you had your dogs not on the lead, just saying.

460
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,660
I haven't got a dog.

461
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,660
Come here, come here.

462
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,660
I haven't got a dog.

463
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
I have a piece of dog control, you alright?

464
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
What's that?

465
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,660
Well, who of those dogs are yours?

466
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,660
Come here, come here.

467
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,660
He was discussing a dog last night, which is day-to-day business.

468
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,660
Day-to-day business is banned.

469
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,660
Well, I don't care if you walk around with dogs, not on a leash, you walk around with dogs.

470
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,660
Don't yell at me, because that's not going to work.

471
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,660
I don't care what you're going to do, alright?

472
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,660
Don't have such a bad attitude, okay?

473
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,660
You're going to have to arrest me.

474
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,660
For what?

475
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,660
Exactly, for what?

476
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,660
For what?

477
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
For what, exactly.

478
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,660
You'll have to arrest me.

479
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,660
Yeah, this is how you do it, man.

480
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,660
This is how you deal with it.

481
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:09,660
Maybe not necessarily as combative as this guy if you're in the States, but you definitely politely but firmly exercise your rights.

482
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,660
Don't consent to talking to the cops, guys.

483
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,660
If they're going to arrest you, they're going to arrest you, and you can argue it later.

484
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,660
Listen to the police.

485
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,660
You walk up to me without masks, and you walk up, and you're within six foot of each other, and you're within six foot of me.

486
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
Practice what you preach.

487
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,660
I'm not within six foot of anyone.

488
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,660
You came to me.

489
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,660
You came to me.

490
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,660
Does it matter?

491
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
My dog with me?

492
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,660
My dog's exercising.

493
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,660
My dog's running around.

494
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,660
I'm not going home.

495
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,660
I'm exercising.

496
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,660
Make your hour.

497
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
Are we living in Nazi Germany or something?

498
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,660
It's a guideline.

499
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Guideline.

500
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,660
You just said the words.

501
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,660
Guideline.

502
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
It's a fucking guideline, dude.

503
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,660
Like she has the actual authority to tell him how long he can stay outside.

504
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,660
Fuck you.

505
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,660
Please don't step any closer towards me.

506
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,660
Please don't step any...

507
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,660
Look at this.

508
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,660
Look at this now.

509
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,660
Look at how close she's getting.

510
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,660
Look how close she's getting.

511
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,660
Yeah, now stay where you are.

512
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,660
I'm exercising my dog.

513
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,660
Well, why didn't you do your job?

514
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,660
What do you mean?

515
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,660
I'm walking my dog.

516
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,660
My dog was running around me.

517
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,660
And then you came up.

518
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,660
You came up without masks.

519
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,660
Within three foot of each other.

520
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,660
Within three foot of me.

521
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,660
Exactly.

522
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,660
Practice what you preach.

523
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
I don't sunbathe.

524
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,660
That's breaking the law.

525
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
What's breaking the law?

526
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
Sunbathing.

527
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,660
Sunbathing?

528
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,660
Yeah, alright.

529
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,660
Look how covered I am.

530
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
Sunbathing.

531
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,660
I've got a hoodie.

532
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,660
She's reaching now.

533
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,660
She just wants to fuck this guy somehow.

534
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,660
She claims he's sunbathing when he's wearing a hoodie.

535
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,660
But still, you know what?

536
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,660
If you're social distancing and you decide to sunbathe,

537
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,660
whose fucking business is that?

538
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
Christ, man.

539
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,660
Yo, have a word with yourself.

540
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,660
A guideline is something that the government wants the people to do.

541
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,660
Thinks it would be in their best interest to do.

542
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,660
But that's not because there'll be punishments from the state if they don't do it.

543
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,660
It's because it's a good idea for themselves.

544
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,660
The police are not meant to enforce guidelines.

545
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,660
They're meant to enforce the law.

546
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,660
Oh, hey.

547
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,660
You want to watch them kick down random people's doors to see if there's parties going on?

548
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,660
Right.

549
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,660
Listen to us.

550
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,660
Hello?

551
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,660
We went to court, haven't we?

552
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
Because we went to court, but otherwise.

553
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,660
No.

554
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,660
There might be something going on in here, so.

555
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,660
You alright?

556
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,660
We need to double check.

557
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,660
What do you want?

558
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,660
I appreciate what you're saying about social distancing, so I'm keeping the distance.

559
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,660
Yeah?

560
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
Yeah, fuck off.

561
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,660
Right, so we need to check the group and make sure nothing's going on.

562
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,660
No, no, no.

563
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
Watch your name.

564
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,660
Stay away from me.

565
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,660
Watch your name.

566
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
Doesn't matter.

567
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,660
What are you doing in my house?

568
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
What are you doing in my house?

569
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
What are you doing in my house?

570
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,660
I just explained to you.

571
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,660
What are you doing in my house?

572
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,660
I just explained to you why we're here.

573
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,660
We've had to call them.

574
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,660
It's a disturbance.

575
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,660
That's why we're here.

576
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,660
What?

577
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,660
So you kicked my door in?

578
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,660
Should you have opened the door?

579
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,660
No.

580
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,660
So they kicked this guy's door down because they think there's a party going on, and now

581
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,660
they're just going to search his house.

582
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,660
This is, unironically, some fascist shit.

583
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,000
I know that that term's kind of been diluted recently because on the radical left side

584
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,240
of things, they call everything that's not them a fascist.

585
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,500
But the police ignoring people's property rights and simply walking around like they

586
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,600
own the place all the time, public or private land, doesn't matter?

587
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
Yeah, that's pretty fascist.

588
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Can I explain that to you?

589
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
No!

590
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,600
I told you why I wouldn't open the door is because of what is going on with this virus.

591
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Now, fuck off.

592
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
You can get out of here.

593
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
One time's satisfied.

594
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
You might have it.

595
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Fucking no.

596
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
One time's satisfied.

597
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
Everything's all right.

598
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
No way.

599
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
Come on.

600
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Get in here, dickhead.

601
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Go on.

602
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
Have a look.

603
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Just check it.

604
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Have a look, dickhead.

605
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
All right.

606
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,760
See, you probably shouldn't have said, have a look, dickhead.

607
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,280
That can be construed as giving consent after the fact.

608
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,200
He should be objecting this whole fucking time.

609
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,660
But yeah, like, he refused to open the door.

610
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,200
They broke down the door.

611
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,460
Jesus.

612
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,760
There's no probable cause for this.

613
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
There's no fucking warrant.

614
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,760
Yeah.

615
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,760
Yeah.

616
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,760
No point only in here, is there?

617
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:17,080
So what do you mean putting me door through, fucking door?

618
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
You're fucking pathetic.

619
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Get out of here.

620
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,560
You absolute disgrace.

621
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,560
And you've got nothing else to do.

622
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
You've put my fucking door through.

623
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
I hope you're going to fucking...

624
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,560
What are you going to fucking do to that?

625
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Oh, shut your fucking mouth, you fucking brain dead cunt.

626
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Get out.

627
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Holy shit, dude.

628
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
I get it.

629
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
I get why he's mad.

630
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,560
It's legitimate, but it's just kind of funny to hear.

631
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Fucking pay, what, 20 grand a year to be a fucking knobhead.

632
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
Fuck off.

633
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Get out.

634
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
Am I fucking out?

635
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Get the fuck out.

636
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
What are you?

637
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Bye.

638
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
Bye.

639
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,040
Fucking idiots.

640
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Broke me fucking door.

641
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,040
Look at the fucking state of this.

642
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Huh?

643
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,040
British fucking police.

644
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,520
Look at the fucking state of it.

645
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,520
You fucking knobheads.

646
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Fuck my life.

647
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Holy shit, dude.

648
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Yeah, they total his door.

649
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
He can't close it now.

650
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
He can't lock it now.

651
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
Now he's going to get robbed.

652
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,520
Oh, and by the way, some places have publicly said that they just don't have the manpower

653
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,520
to stop robberies anymore.

654
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,520
So if someone's robbing you and you call the police, they just can't show up.

655
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Great time to leave somebody with no fucking door then.

656
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,760
With techs doing their part too, landing AI has developed a tool that ensures people keep

657
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,040
their social distance.

658
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,640
The green blocks are people who have kept social distance and the red blocks are people

659
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,740
who aren't.

660
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:03,600
And you can see on the bird's eye view where the red blocks are too close to some people.

661
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,040
Thanks big tech.

662
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,360
Now the police can just monitor every street and give everyone tickets all the fucking

663
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
time.

664
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,000
Google's getting in on it too.

665
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,800
Google's sharing Canadian's location data with the government, but says the privacy

666
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
is assured.

667
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,720
How is the privacy assured if you're sharing it with the government?

668
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,120
It's already been shared.

669
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,600
Let's see what they're actually implementing in all of these locations.

670
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,120
These are the fines you can get in Toronto and Ontario for coronavirus right now.

671
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,380
Residents of Toronto are required to follow the newly implemented social distancing by-law.

672
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,580
The by-law requires any two people who don't live together to keep two meters of distance

673
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,640
between them and a park or public square.

674
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,080
Anyone who fails to comply with the new by-law can receive a maximum set fine of $1,000.

675
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,160
Police officers across Ontario are enforcing provincial orders banning organized social

676
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:56,120
gatherings of more than five people as well as bans on using closed playgrounds in other

677
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
parks.

678
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,320
The city is also issuing fines to non-essential businesses that remain open despite provincial

679
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,720
orders to shut down.

680
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,000
In London, go engulfing on that $750 fine.

681
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,280
Doesn't matter if the course is closed and therefore empty and therefore no one is

682
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,320
getting infected, $750.

683
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:21,040
The city of Laredo, Texas has mandated that people wear masks in public or face a $1,000

684
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,040
fine.

685
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,360
The fines for not complying with social distancing rules in Vancouver is also $1,000.

686
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,000
For businesses, it's $50,000.

687
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,320
Fifty-nine charges have already been laid in Hamilton, including against seven businesses.

688
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:41,600
Hamilton has 331 cases and 16 deaths, while its population is half a million.

689
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,120
Let's see if these various new restrictions are bearing any fruit.

690
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,280
First, UK arrest for failing to self-isolate over the coronavirus as man at 26 is held

691
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,600
on the Isle of Man.

692
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:59,640
A 26-year-old male faces a 10,000-pound fine and three months in jail after arriving on

693
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,400
the Isle of Man then refusing to go into a 14-day quarantine.

694
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,500
The Quebec City Police arrest a coronavirus patient for defying her quarantine.

695
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,120
She tested positive but was still going around town.

696
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,560
A coronavirus patient is now under 24-7 armed guard after refusing to self-isolate.

697
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,680
The governor of the state of Kentucky had to make this decision because the person just

698
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,080
would not stay indoors.

699
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,160
Now, I kind of get it when it's somebody who's actually been confirmed to have the

700
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,960
virus, but it's happening to just random people, too.

701
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,960
In the UK, a woman was wrongly charged £660 under a new coronavirus law.

702
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,480
Two women in Texas were arrested for offering home beauty and salon services out of their

703
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
house.

704
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,280
They were in fact discovered by undercover cops who posed as customers.

705
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:52,120
Six people were shot at a California house party that violated the stay-at-home order.

706
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,320
The victims were five adults and one juvenile.

707
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:01,560
A driver-in-training was fined $1600 for non-essential travel during the coronavirus lockdown.

708
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:07,920
It really does seem like they're going after everybody, but actually it's not everybody.

709
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,000
The police let a wedding with 30 guests and a drummer go ahead in Melbourne despite a

710
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,320
ban on ceremonies with more than five guests, just telling them to keep 1.5 metres apart.

711
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,720
Check out this wedding picture, guys.

712
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,280
I mean, you think there might be something about this as to why they're not enforcing

713
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
the rules equally?

714
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,680
You think it's just random chance or you think something might be going on here?

715
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,720
I don't know.

716
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,760
A French official says the quarantine should not be enforced in migrant areas to avoid

717
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
riots.

718
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,360
It's not a priority to enforce closings in certain neighbourhoods.

719
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,840
Is that all it takes?

720
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,480
In order for us to get our rights back, all we have to do is riot?

721
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,780
Really, is that it?

722
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,160
Or maybe it's just riot while not being white.

723
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,720
There are two headlines, though, that are absolutely insane.

724
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,900
We should blow up the bridges.

725
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,520
Coronavirus leads to class warfare in Hamptons.

726
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,160
I guess they don't want people coming to town.

727
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,240
And check out this Nazi shit.

728
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,960
Montana County demands people wear government-issued armbands to do business.

729
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
Wow.

730
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,040
You literally have to have your papers, not just your papers, but your Nazi armband in

731
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,800
order to buy and sell in this area.

732
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,920
This flyer was given to all the businesses in the area.

733
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,960
Did you see a pink wristband in Valley County?

734
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,360
What does it mean?

735
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,760
Anyone who is from out of town or out of Valley County who has a pink wristband has been here

736
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,700
14 days or more, and no longer needs to do the strict self-quarantine.

737
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,060
They may enter your business.

738
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,720
Anyone who is from out of town or out of Valley County, staying here or working here, and

739
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,200
has not completed the 14-day quarantine is required by the Valley County Health Officer

740
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,680
Order to use curbside delivery only.

741
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,000
They are not to enter your business to shop.

742
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,880
Someone working on each shift must talk to the people and insist that they follow the

743
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
orders.

744
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,920
If, after explaining the requirements, the person doesn't comply, you are to call law

745
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,960
enforcement.

746
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,000
This is probably the most draconian thing to come out of this so far.

747
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,480
Of course, the internet knows exactly how to strike back against this kind of nonsense.

748
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,240
Like when New York City's mayor put this up.

749
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,400
How do you report places that aren't enforcing social distancing?

750
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
It's simple.

751
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,120
Snap a photo and text it to 311692.

752
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,200
Well, no one's surprised that this happened, right?

753
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,160
de Blasio's social distancing tip line was flooded with penis photos and Hitler memes.

754
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,680
Thank you 4chan.

755
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,600
Mayor Bill de Blasio's critics let him know how they really felt about him, ordering New

756
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,440
Yorkers to snitch on each other for violating social distancing rules.

757
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:42,320
By flooding his new tip line with crank complaints including dick pics and people flipping the

758
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,280
bird, photos of extended middle fingers, the mayor dropping the Staten Island groundhog,

759
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:53,160
and news coverage of him going to the gym have all been texted to a special tip line

760
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,440
that de Blasio announced Saturday.

761
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,600
Fuck you, replied Morden L. Schmidt 1, along with a meme showing Adolf Hitler and the words,

762
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,060
To those turning in your neighbors and local businesses, you did the right thing.

763
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:12,000
Other profane messages included a photo of a bowl of gummy candies in the shape of many

764
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:21,480
male genitalia and a sign saying eat a bag of dicks.

765
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:27,200
He looked at me and coofed in my direction, the caller said, according to a photo of the

766
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,920
311 operator's computer screen.

767
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:36,720
Coof is a newly coined term for coughing while infected with the coronavirus.

768
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,560
I love it when like old style media tries to report on memes.

769
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,420
It's been hilarious shit for years man, even going back to the whole exploding van, lulls

770
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,160
is a corruption of lol, kinda stuff that we saw from Fox News in like 2007 or whatever

771
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
it was.

772
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,240
And yes, at this point they actually are mask off tyrants.

773
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,520
Michigan governor considers extending the coronavirus restrictions because of the protesters.

774
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,880
Not for any other reason, not because Michigan for some reason needs it, not for any kind

775
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,380
of health or economic reason or whatever, just because people protested.

776
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,620
This is very much like a one more word from you mister and you're on the ground for another

777
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,980
3 months kind of deal.

778
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:22,180
And I'm not at all surprised because the democratic governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, actually

779
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,180
looks like a Karen.

780
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:29,380
It's that kind of irresponsible action that puts us in this situation where we might have

781
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:34,540
to actually think about extending stay home orders, which is supposedly what they were

782
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,540
protesting.

783
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,260
Thanks mom, I hate it.

784
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,100
And some people really are crying out for the government to be their parent, to swoop

785
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:46,160
in and save them and coddle them and restrict them the way that a parent would.

786
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,300
To beat this coronavirus we must sacrifice our freedoms.

787
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:56,900
South Korea, China, Singapore and Taiwan have demonstrated that draconian methods like tracking

788
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,180
people with technology work.

789
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,180
Have they?

790
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,860
Because we all know that China's cooking the numbers, and we've seen a natural decline

791
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:10,420
in the acceleration of cases all over the world, whether or not they actually used draconian

792
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,420
methods.

793
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:17,060
This disease is so infectious, governments must unleash the big brother bazooka by deploying

794
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,140
technology.

795
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,020
This is the only way to fully halt the contagion.

796
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,940
Testing must be universal and mandatory.

797
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:29,300
Smartphones and other devices can help authorities monitor people's movements in order to enforce

798
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,220
social distancing and prevent them from gathering.

799
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:36,700
Data on the movements of those who are quarantined or known to be infected can help authorities

800
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,300
track down who's been exposed.

801
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,960
Infected Koreans are separated from their family and friends and put into government

802
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,020
isolation shelters.

803
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,520
Their phone and credit card data is used by health authorities to trace their movements

804
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,800
and contacts.

805
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,500
Every contact or person in the vicinity of their journeys is sent a warning on their

806
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:02,340
phones and told they must quarantine themselves at home, where they are monitored by a GPS

807
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,340
app.

808
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,540
If they leave home, they face huge fines.

809
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:11,340
The Chinese require anyone who's tested positive, is isolated or has been exposed to victims

810
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:16,380
to download software on their smartphones that allows police to access a colour code

811
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,280
that defines their health status and whether they should be in quarantine or free to use

812
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,760
public spaces.

813
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,300
These measures are not overkill.

814
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,380
Canadians are mostly compliant, but many need more discipline.

815
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,980
We've all seen reckless people on beaches and parks, oblivious to the wellbeing of others.

816
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,740
Many are refusing to stay home, keep their distance from others or are gathering privately.

817
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:44,140
All of these people are potential spreaders, or as one headline labelled them, Covidiots.

818
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:50,900
Laws with fines and punishments already exist but aren't working, nor is public shaming.

819
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,820
Using Canadians using technology will keep everyone honest.

820
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:00,360
Skittishness about privacy or freedom are valid concerns, but the status quo dictates

821
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,300
that extraordinary action must be undertaken.

822
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,900
This also means truly sealing our borders until the crisis is over.

823
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:13,240
The fact is that freedom is the right to swing your arm, but not to hit anyone with it.

824
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:18,280
And privacy is a cherished privilege, but only if it causes no harm.

825
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,600
This is the socialist paradise.

826
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,820
This is what every young leftist has been screaming about wanting for the past decade.

827
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:30,960
Capitalism has been broken, at least temporarily, replaced by state control of everything.

828
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,880
Freedoms are curtailed for, supposedly, the greater good.

829
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,080
Earning your own money has been replaced with government handouts.

830
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,320
The newly 18 year old socialists were promised paradise, but the realities of this level

831
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,820
of government control are actually quite bleak.

832
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,160
The left has been saying for a while now that they could actually create utopia on earth,

833
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,600
as long as the average person simply surrendered their basic rights to government control and

834
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,640
accepted the nationalization of everything.

835
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,440
And here we are.

836
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,920
Governments around the world, both autocratic and democratic, have begun to seize power

837
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,320
and issue authoritarian crackdowns.

838
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,060
Who knows how many of them will actually give up all of this emergency authority once the

839
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,580
coronavirus crisis has run its course.

840
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:16,720
Our cities now have an extra police presence, sometimes even an extra military presence

841
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,720
in them.

842
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,760
That force will be wielded by the same people that have closed our schools, our businesses,

843
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,720
our churches, our public spaces, our gyms, our libraries, and our clubs.

844
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,120
We still don't know just how far they're willing to go in using that military force to try

845
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,120
to keep people off the streets.

846
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:41,120
But we are being asked by both the state, and frankly, the dumber segments of our population,

847
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,680
to simply accept it, and to hope that the people in charge come good on their promise

848
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,780
to give our civil liberties back.

849
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,120
It's not all bad.

850
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,680
It is true that there are definitely some civil servants out there who are acting out

851
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,760
of a genuine, urgent need to keep people safe right now during a crisis.

852
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,540
But there's just as many hidden authoritarians that are salivating at the prospect of keeping

853
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,240
people in their place.

854
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,520
Don't let them do it.

855
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,520
Protest.

856
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,680
And protest doesn't mean go out there and get into violent brawls with the cops or throw

857
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,840
a brick at them or something, because then it becomes a riot.

858
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,640
Then you've actually broken the law and done something wrong.

859
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,800
Still protesting means that you're willing to get arrested.

860
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,000
It means that you're potentially willing to have a record.

861
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,060
Say what you want about Bernie Sanders, but those old pictures of him being dragged away

862
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,360
by the cops because he was peacefully protesting in what he believed?

863
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,440
That is the kind of thing that you have to do right now, if protest is your aim.

864
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,640
You have to be willing to spend a night or two in jail.

865
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,160
But as long as you don't forfeit the high ground, it will probably be better for you

866
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
in the end.

867
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,960
A couple months ago on this channel I was talking about how it was probably a good idea

868
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,960
to shut things down.

869
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,720
And I actually still agree with that because the whole point of shutting society down,

870
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,480
at least temporarily, and using federal power to grant that authority, it's not because

871
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
there's a coronavirus pandemic.

872
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,720
It's because there's a pandemic of an unknown virus that we have no idea how to combat.

873
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,120
But now we do, at least somewhat.

874
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,280
We have some ideas.

875
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,680
We know a little bit more about it.

876
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,680
Shutting things down was meant to buy us time so that we could actually study this virus,

877
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,300
learn what was going on with it, and figure out what to do about it.

878
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,040
We are largely at that stage.

879
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,480
We don't have a vaccine yet, but we do have some effective treatments.

880
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,440
Our manufacturing capacity has ramped up again, such that the shortages of masks and ventilators,

881
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,020
as well as stuff like food and toilet paper, has largely gone away.

882
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,960
Now is the time to open back up, because we've figured out what to do about it and now we

883
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
can do it.

884
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,960
And there is no good reason to stay indoors anymore.

885
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,220
Even if there is this dreaded second wave, dealing with the second wave is better than

886
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,840
giving up our rights.

887
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,880
Because if those rights are actually gone, they're gone for everyone, not just people

888
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,860
who are infected, and they could be gone for a generation.

889
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,000
We are actually living in the socialist paradise.

890
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,060
It is no wonder that not only does nobody like it, but that governments around the world

891
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:58,680
are turning into, at various speeds, the exact type of thing that we need to prevent.

892
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,340
All humans must keep indoors.

893
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:16,340
All humans must go by the lights, by order of the direct.

894
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,340
All humans must keep indoors.

895
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:25,840
All humans must go by the lights, by order of the direct.
