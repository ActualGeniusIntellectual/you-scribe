WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.500
We are now living in a socialist paradise.

00:02.500 --> 00:03.600
No, really.

00:03.600 --> 00:09.600
Industries are closing down, capitalism is being replaced by Trump bucks, Trudeau bucks, Boris bucks.

00:09.600 --> 00:13.700
We're living simpler lives, less travel, way fewer carbon emissions,

00:13.700 --> 00:16.500
governments are nationalizing and taking over everything.

00:16.500 --> 00:20.000
This is what the far left has been advocating for for years.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
How do you like it?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.200
How does it feel that you can no longer freely consent to enter into employment with somebody,

00:25.200 --> 00:27.800
to negotiate for a wage in a field you're interested in,

00:27.800 --> 00:30.300
and instead you simply have to stay home and take what you're given?

00:30.300 --> 00:32.700
How does it feel that you can no longer go outside?

00:32.700 --> 00:37.400
That those roads, those parks, those schools and libraries that you pay tax money for,

00:37.400 --> 00:38.700
you can no longer use?

00:38.700 --> 00:41.300
How does it feel with all private business shut down?

00:41.300 --> 00:45.300
Because the state has decided that free people can no longer engage in commerce.

00:45.300 --> 00:47.500
How do you like the socialist paradise?

00:47.500 --> 00:50.100
This is a document that Naomi's been given by her workplace

00:50.100 --> 00:52.800
that basically identifies her as an essential worker.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.200
She works at a grocery store.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.700
Canada is not yet at the level where we're checking people's papers.

00:57.700 --> 01:01.600
But various essential businesses have been giving these out anyway, just in case.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.400
Some countries are a lot worse with it.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.800
Here's one from France.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.800
It basically says that in order to leave your house,

01:07.800 --> 01:10.400
you have to fill this out and give it to the police.

01:10.400 --> 01:14.300
It outlines who you are, where you live, and where you're going.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.600
Here's Italy's form.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.200
Pretty much the same thing.

01:17.200 --> 01:21.900
What kind of free society asks you for your papers just so you can travel?

01:21.900 --> 01:23.500
It's not just papers, though.

01:23.500 --> 01:28.800
Westwood Bar boarded up by police after continuing to serve food and drinks indoors.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.400
I mean, it's stupid.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.200
But what's the problem?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.700
It's people's choice.

01:32.700 --> 01:36.600
If idiots want to go there and get sick, isn't that their prerogative?

01:36.600 --> 01:40.300
Isn't it on the individual to be responsible and manage their own life?

01:40.300 --> 01:46.200
On Monday night, Queen City Lounge had 40 customers inside drinking and eating from a full buffet.

01:46.200 --> 01:50.900
On Tuesday afternoon, several arrests later, police boarded the place up.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.400
The Westwood Bar had continued to operate as usual,

01:53.400 --> 01:58.600
despite Ohio Governor Mike DeWine's order that all restaurants and bars in the state of Ohio

01:58.600 --> 02:01.900
end their dine-in services to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.900
It was more than a risk to patrons, the police chief added.

02:04.900 --> 02:09.000
Now you're putting first responders at risk because we get the information that they're open.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.600
There's 40-plus people inside.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.700
Who knows who may have already come into contact with coronavirus,

02:13.700 --> 02:16.900
and now our first responders are having to interact with those folks.

02:16.900 --> 02:20.000
It wasn't the first warning the Queen City Lounge had received.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.700
It pains us to have to do this.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.000
It pains us that we are in these uncharted waters.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.500
This is new territory for your police department.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.700
What new territory? Being authoritarians?

02:28.700 --> 02:31.500
Yes, I agree with you. It's stupid that they're still open.

02:31.500 --> 02:34.300
It's stupid that people are congregating there.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.400
But are you actually saying that people don't have the right to be stupid?

02:37.400 --> 02:41.400
It's not good for them to be stupid, but should the government prevent them from being?

02:41.400 --> 02:43.900
Is safety a more important value than freedom?

02:43.900 --> 02:45.100
Is that where we are now?

02:45.100 --> 02:47.800
Well, this is where that kind of thinking goes.

02:47.900 --> 02:52.400
Rhode Island police to hunt down New Yorkers seeking refuge.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.200
Cars are stopped, homes to be checked to enforce quarantines.

02:56.200 --> 03:00.200
Officers halt cars on the interstate to start the crackdown.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.800
What's going on here is that the state of New York is seriously suffering from coronavirus,

03:03.800 --> 03:06.200
far worse than most of the rest of the United States.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.500
And so people who have a New York license plate on their vehicles,

03:08.500 --> 03:11.000
but are driving to Rhode Island to get away from it,

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
are going to be rounded up by the Rhode Island police.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.800
This is the type of totalitarian nightmare you get

03:16.800 --> 03:19.400
when safety is a higher virtue than freedom.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.500
The state can justify violating all sorts of rights

03:22.500 --> 03:24.900
if it views it to be in the person's best interest.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.700
And if the state's view of what your best interest is

03:27.700 --> 03:30.300
comes into conflict with your right of self-determination,

03:30.300 --> 03:31.500
well, fuck you then.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.300
Yesterday I announced, and today I reiterated,

03:34.300 --> 03:38.000
anyone coming to Rhode Island in any way from New York must be quarantined,

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
the governor said.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.100
By order, will be enforced, enforceable by law.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.000
She signed an executive order Thursday that applies to anyone

03:45.000 --> 03:47.500
who has been in New York during the past two weeks,

03:47.500 --> 03:49.700
and through at least April 25th.

03:49.700 --> 03:53.900
National Guard members will be stationed at the T.F. Green Airport,

03:53.900 --> 03:56.700
Amtrak train stations, and at bus stops.

03:56.700 --> 04:01.600
The citizen soldiers will be following up with people at local residences.

04:01.600 --> 04:06.700
The maximum penalty for not complying is a fine of $500 and 90 days in prison.

04:06.700 --> 04:09.400
The American Civil Liberties Union blasted the new rules,

04:09.400 --> 04:12.600
objecting to the collection of the motorist contact information in particular.

04:12.600 --> 04:16.400
While the governor may have the power to suspend some state laws and regulations

04:16.400 --> 04:20.400
to address this medical emergency, she cannot suspend the constitution.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.800
Under the Fourth Amendment, having a New York state license plate

04:23.800 --> 04:27.500
simply does not, and cannot, constitute probable cause

04:27.500 --> 04:30.500
to allow police to stop a car and interrogate the driver,

04:30.500 --> 04:33.700
no matter how laudable the goal of the stop may be.

04:33.700 --> 04:34.800
And they're absolutely right.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.200
The ACLU has been kind of hit and miss recently,

04:37.200 --> 04:39.400
but this is absolutely the case.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.900
People's natural rights do not vanish just because of an emergency,

04:42.900 --> 04:47.700
and you can tell exactly which politicians have always been authoritarians in waiting,

04:47.700 --> 04:49.900
based on how they're responding to this crisis.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.100
Speaking of citizen soldiers,

04:52.100 --> 04:57.300
this would not be a complete video if we didn't watch all the various snitches that are floating around right now.

04:57.300 --> 04:58.200
Let's check it out.

05:09.400 --> 05:13.600
You're a little pop, seriously? Seriously, I called the cops.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.400
I can't watch.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.200
I'm so scared. I'm so scared.

05:17.200 --> 05:21.400
Shouldn't she be social distancing from them?

05:21.400 --> 05:24.900
They closed the window on her, dude. She's spitting all over the place.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.100
Like seriously, what's going on here? The road is empty.

05:28.100 --> 05:30.300
These are just two kids driving around in the car.

05:30.300 --> 05:33.000
They're not doing anything. They're not exposing anybody to coronavirus.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.100
Like they leave their house, they hop in the car, they drive around,

05:36.100 --> 05:38.300
they go back to their house, they go back inside.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.600
Just to get, just to get the fuck out for a minute or two.

05:41.600 --> 05:45.000
And you have these moral busybodies who just can't wait to get you in trouble

05:45.000 --> 05:47.600
because they have nothing else going on in their pathetic lives.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.600
This one looks like it's from the UK, just based on the signs and what they're wearing

05:50.600 --> 05:54.300
and some of the stuff that's on the road, but we'll see.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.300
Hi guys.

05:55.300 --> 05:55.600
Hello.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.300
Do you work for the NHS?

05:57.300 --> 05:58.500
Uh, no.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.800
Who do you work for?

05:59.800 --> 06:01.300
For community fibre.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.300
So what are you laying?

06:03.300 --> 06:04.100
Fibre.

06:04.100 --> 06:06.000
Fibre. What kind of fibre?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.600
Fibre optic, 5G ones.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.100
But you're not supposed to be within two metres of each other

06:11.100 --> 06:14.600
and you're supposed to be essential. Is this essential work?

06:14.600 --> 06:16.600
Uh, I think so. I don't know.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.100
He just sent me to do the job and I just can't.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.900
Dude, they're laying 5G fibre optic cable.

06:21.900 --> 06:24.200
They're causing the coronavirus.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.600
I understand it's not essential and you don't work for the NHS.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.600
So why are you doing it?

06:27.600 --> 06:30.800
Does it not negate the government's guidelines?

06:30.800 --> 06:32.900
Yeah, if you want to make a complaint.

06:32.900 --> 06:35.200
Who do I complain to? Who's your boss?

06:35.200 --> 06:38.200
Uh, I have a number for the courtesy board.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.700
Where is the white van and the red barriers.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.700
If you want to call.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.700
But do you know what you're doing now? You're laying 5G.

06:43.700 --> 06:44.700
Yeah.

06:44.700 --> 06:45.700
You realise that, don't you?

06:45.700 --> 06:46.200
Yeah.

06:46.200 --> 06:46.700
Yeah?

06:46.700 --> 06:47.200
Yeah.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.200
So what, do you know that kills people?

06:49.200 --> 06:52.200
You know, I said that as a joke.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.200
I didn't know she was actually going to go there.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.200
They turn this on, it's going to kill everyone

06:56.200 --> 06:58.200
and that's why they're building the hospitals?

06:58.200 --> 06:59.200
Yep.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.700
How do you feel? Do you have children?

07:00.700 --> 07:02.200
No, I'm young.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.200
Do you have parents?

07:04.200 --> 07:05.200
Just my mum.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.200
Well, how do you feel when they turn that switch on?

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
Bye-bye, mama.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.200
Holy shit, lady.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.200
Like, let him get on with his fucking work, dude.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.700
If you want to complain, call his head office.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.700
Like, okay, I've done this kind of work before.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.200
Not laying 5G, obviously, but you know, this kind of,

07:20.200 --> 07:23.200
you're out in the streets and you're doing public service work.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.200
And we were always told,

07:25.200 --> 07:29.200
listen, if someone has a complaint about the labourer's work,

07:29.200 --> 07:31.200
they call the head office, they call the town hall,

07:31.200 --> 07:32.700
they call the public works office.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.700
They don't try to get us to stop it,

07:34.700 --> 07:37.700
because even though our salaries were funded by taxes,

07:37.700 --> 07:39.700
an individual member of the public doesn't have the right

07:39.700 --> 07:41.700
to liaison directly with an individual worker.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.700
That's not how the system works.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.700
There are ways you can complain and change things,

07:45.700 --> 07:47.700
but not by harassing a low-level worker.

07:47.700 --> 07:51.700
We'll all be in hospital on breathing apparatus.

07:51.700 --> 07:54.700
Why do you think they're building 25,000

07:54.700 --> 07:57.700
sort of concentration camps of death?

07:57.700 --> 08:00.700
Are hospitals concentration camps now?

08:00.700 --> 08:01.700
Holy shit.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.700
They called those camps at the border concentration camps.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.700
I'm pretty sure that they were places to detain people

08:06.700 --> 08:09.700
before they deport them, not places that they put people to keep them in.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.700
They were throwing them out.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.700
But listen, like, just because the state has to put people somewhere

08:15.700 --> 08:19.700
because of some reason, many of which are legitimate,

08:19.700 --> 08:21.700
doesn't mean that it's a concentration camp.

08:21.700 --> 08:25.700
Video. Americans being forced to take the coronavirus test.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.700
This can't be good.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.700
Please leave me alone.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.700
Please leave me alone.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.700
Please leave me alone.

08:34.700 --> 08:36.700
Please leave me alone.

08:36.700 --> 08:37.700
Please leave me alone, bro.

08:37.700 --> 08:39.700
Not until you get on the bed.

08:39.700 --> 08:40.700
I'm not getting on the bed.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.700
Man, help me out, bro.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.700
It doesn't work like that, bro.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.700
Can anybody know a lawyer, bro?

08:46.700 --> 08:48.700
Somebody sent me a lawyer.

08:48.700 --> 08:51.700
No, no, no!

08:51.700 --> 08:53.700
It don't work like that, man.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.700
This shit ain't right, man.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.700
Nah, don't put the phone down now, motherfucker.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.700
Now, bro, leave me alone.

09:00.700 --> 09:01.700
I don't want to leave it on my own.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.700
It don't work like that.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.700
It does not work like that, bro.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.700
No, no.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.700
Y'all need to change mental health awareness.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.700
Mental health help.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.700
Man, no.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.700
No, man.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.700
No, no.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.700
The time is now.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.700
The time is now.

09:21.700 --> 09:22.700
No.

09:22.700 --> 09:23.700
I'm not on drugs.

09:23.700 --> 09:24.700
None of that, bro.

09:24.700 --> 09:25.700
I'm insane.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.700
I'm insane, man.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.700
Y'all don't want this crazy.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.700
Y'all don't want this crazy, bro.

09:31.700 --> 09:32.700
No.

09:32.700 --> 09:33.700
No.

09:33.700 --> 09:34.700
Uh-uh.

09:34.700 --> 09:35.700
No.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.700
Bro, get your motherfucking hands off me, bro.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.700
It don't work like this, bro.

09:39.700 --> 09:41.700
I would tear this bitch up, nigga, on my mother, nigga.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.700
Get off of me.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.700
Get off me, bro.

09:45.700 --> 09:46.700
It don't work like that.

09:46.700 --> 09:47.700
I'm not crazy.

09:47.700 --> 09:48.700
You crazy, right, man?

09:48.700 --> 09:49.700
Leave me alone, bro.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.700
Yeah, you did.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.700
I'm not scared of nothing, bro.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.700
I'm not scared of nothing, bro.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.700
Please leave me the fuck alone, bro.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.700
It don't work like that, bro.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.700
Come on.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.700
Get off me.

10:02.700 --> 10:03.700
Holy shit.

10:03.700 --> 10:05.700
Y'all weak as a bitch.

10:05.700 --> 10:06.700
Right here.

10:06.700 --> 10:07.700
J, come on.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.700
Come on, bro.

10:08.700 --> 10:12.700
Come on.

10:12.700 --> 10:13.700
Stop.

10:13.700 --> 10:14.700
Stop.

10:14.700 --> 10:15.700
Hey.

10:15.700 --> 10:16.700
You're choking me.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.700
You're choking me.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.700
You're choking me, bro.

10:18.700 --> 10:19.700
Stop.

10:19.700 --> 10:20.700
You're choking me, bro.

10:20.700 --> 10:21.700
Uh-uh.

10:21.700 --> 10:22.700
Stop.

10:22.700 --> 10:23.700
Help.

10:23.700 --> 10:24.700
Stop.

10:24.700 --> 10:25.700
Help, man.

10:25.700 --> 10:26.700
This shit ain't right, bro.

10:26.700 --> 10:27.700
Stop.

10:27.700 --> 10:28.700
Stop.

10:28.700 --> 10:29.700
Stop.

10:29.700 --> 10:30.700
Stop.

10:30.700 --> 10:31.700
This shit ain't right.

10:31.700 --> 10:32.700
Aah.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.700
Aah.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.700
Aah.

10:34.700 --> 10:35.700
Aah.

10:35.700 --> 10:36.700
Aah, motherfucker.

10:36.700 --> 10:37.700
All right.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.700
It's going to be a revolution now.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.700
Y'all already know what's ahead of the story.

10:42.700 --> 10:46.700
Y'all have to get it into motion.

10:46.700 --> 10:47.700
Yeah.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.700
Jesus Christ.

10:49.700 --> 10:59.960
Okay, so I understand the necessity of testing people for a novel new disease, but it's my

10:59.960 --> 11:05.940
understanding that not only human rights, but medical ethics dictate that until someone

11:05.940 --> 11:12.500
falls unconscious, if they are actively refusing treatment, you can't treat them?

11:12.500 --> 11:14.860
This seems wildly unethical.

11:14.860 --> 11:19.180
Like, you always hear about people who, like, they're overdosing on drugs and they're like,

11:19.180 --> 11:21.740
no, man, I don't want treatment, I just want to die.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.020
And the paramedics are there.

11:23.020 --> 11:26.540
And they have to wait for the person to fall unconscious before they can start treating

11:26.540 --> 11:29.780
them because they are explicitly not consenting.

11:29.780 --> 11:31.700
But these people, they just don't fucking care.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.380
It's disgusting.

11:33.380 --> 11:36.380
I've seen this one a few times, but check this shit out, guys.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.660
This is some South American country.

11:38.660 --> 11:43.300
They have squads of people in hazmat suits running around, just chasing down anyone they

11:43.300 --> 11:46.020
see in public.

11:46.020 --> 11:48.580
If you catch somebody, you lock them up.

11:48.580 --> 11:51.620
I think this video is from Massachusetts.

11:51.620 --> 11:56.100
A church here is doing a drive-in method of holding services.

11:56.100 --> 12:00.260
The idea being that I guess they all sit in their cars and they give the service?

12:00.260 --> 12:01.260
I'm not sure.

12:01.260 --> 12:04.100
Let's see what happens.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.100
Look at this, y'all.

12:05.100 --> 12:11.140
All these, they heard through the grapevine we're having service at 6.30.

12:11.140 --> 12:14.700
And there's more police cars at a church service.

12:14.900 --> 12:18.860
Yes, this is King James Bible Baptist Church where Pastor Hamilton, where I'm the pastor

12:18.860 --> 12:20.140
of the church at.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.820
This is America, private property of a church.

12:22.820 --> 12:23.820
Look at this, y'all.

12:23.820 --> 12:24.820
There's more police pulling up.

12:24.820 --> 12:25.820
They ain't done.

12:25.820 --> 12:26.820
Yes, sir.

12:26.820 --> 12:30.020
I got a letter from my lawyer, too.

12:30.020 --> 12:32.020
You want to read my letter from my lawyer?

12:32.020 --> 12:33.900
Okay, I'm good.

12:33.900 --> 12:34.900
I got that.

12:34.900 --> 12:35.900
I know.

12:35.900 --> 12:36.900
I know about it.

12:36.900 --> 12:37.900
Yes, sir.

12:37.900 --> 12:38.900
Yes, sir.

12:38.900 --> 12:39.900
Yes, sir.

12:39.900 --> 12:40.900
Yes, sir.

12:40.900 --> 12:41.900
We're going to get tickets.

12:41.900 --> 12:42.900
Yes, sir.

12:42.900 --> 12:43.900
Yes.

12:43.900 --> 12:44.900
Yes, sir.

12:44.900 --> 12:45.900
Yes, sir.

12:45.900 --> 12:46.900
Yes, sir.

12:46.900 --> 13:02.260
No, the government, our right don't come from authority.

13:02.260 --> 13:03.580
It comes from the Bible.

13:03.580 --> 13:06.100
So the authority does not have the right over the Constitution.

13:06.100 --> 13:08.100
We're talking about the constitutional law.

13:08.100 --> 13:12.660
The first Second Amendment, the U.S. Constitution that was given to us by our forefather, Tate

13:12.660 --> 13:16.500
Reid can't take it away, Eric Simmons can't take it away, nor the police officer.

13:16.500 --> 13:17.500
It be suspended.

13:17.500 --> 13:18.500
It can't.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.500
By the military.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.500
No, it can't.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.740
Hey, look at this, y'all.

13:21.740 --> 13:23.940
I'm a good citizen here.

13:23.940 --> 13:24.940
I don't sell drugs.

13:24.940 --> 13:25.940
Look at the police.

13:25.940 --> 13:27.300
At least I'm as a pastor.

13:27.300 --> 13:30.620
I got a police officer here, y'all, like I'm commending, like I'm robbing or I can kill

13:30.620 --> 13:31.620
somebody.

13:31.620 --> 13:32.620
This is what you...

13:32.620 --> 13:34.460
They don't have this when a murderer is in Greenville, y'all.

13:34.460 --> 13:36.660
Listen to these fucking pigs, dude.

13:36.660 --> 13:37.660
Your rights are suspended.

13:38.220 --> 13:39.340
Yeah, bullshit they are.

13:39.340 --> 13:44.000
Natural rights can never be suspended, and the American Constitution is not suspended

13:44.000 --> 13:45.580
because of a pandemic.

13:45.580 --> 13:48.460
Multiple pandemics have happened throughout American history.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.580
The Constitution was never suspended.

13:50.580 --> 13:54.740
There is no mechanism by which it can be suspended in that way for that reason.

13:54.740 --> 13:57.460
Fuck these power hungry tyrants.

13:57.460 --> 13:58.700
Here's one from Philadelphia.

14:08.660 --> 14:10.660
Yo, man, what are you saying, man?

14:10.660 --> 14:11.660
That's orange, y'all.

14:11.660 --> 14:14.660
What the fuck am I holding on to?

14:14.660 --> 14:16.660
Yo, you gonna feel this, man?

14:16.660 --> 14:18.660
Look what the fuck y'all are pulling on me, y'all, man.

14:18.660 --> 14:19.660
Get the fuck off me.

14:19.660 --> 14:20.660
Yeah.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.660
Get the fuck off my fucking legs.

14:27.660 --> 14:30.660
This man's crime was not wearing a mask on a bus.

14:30.660 --> 14:31.660
That's it.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.660
He wasn't causing a scene.

14:33.660 --> 14:35.160
He wasn't coughing on anyone's face.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.660
He wasn't spitting on them.

14:36.660 --> 14:39.660
He was just sitting there without a mask.

14:39.660 --> 14:42.660
Wouldn't it have been easier just to just give him a mask?

14:42.660 --> 14:48.660
If you do not have a mask, you cannot ride public transportation, sir.

14:48.660 --> 14:49.660
Sir.

14:49.660 --> 14:53.660
You have to get off the bus, you have to get off the bus.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.660
Sir.

14:55.660 --> 14:56.660
Sir.

14:56.660 --> 14:57.660
Let's go.

15:08.660 --> 15:09.660
You gotta get off the bus, man.

15:09.660 --> 15:12.660
I'm gonna have the cops take you off, one or the other.

15:12.660 --> 15:13.660
You have to get off.

15:13.660 --> 15:14.660
You have to get off.

15:14.660 --> 15:15.660
You have to get off.

15:15.660 --> 15:16.660
Let's go.

15:16.660 --> 15:17.660
I have to get off?

15:17.660 --> 15:18.660
Yes, sir.

15:18.660 --> 15:19.660
You don't have no mask.

15:19.660 --> 15:20.660
Let's go.

15:20.660 --> 15:21.660
Let's go.

15:21.660 --> 15:22.660
You gotta get off.

15:22.660 --> 15:23.660
Let's go.

15:23.660 --> 15:24.660
Let's go.

15:24.660 --> 15:25.660
You gotta get off.

15:25.660 --> 15:26.660
Fuck you.

15:26.660 --> 15:30.660
You pay your taxes, you pay that fare, you're fucking entitled to it.

15:30.660 --> 15:34.660
He was throwing people off who, like, they couldn't afford masks or couldn't find them, obviously.

15:34.660 --> 15:38.660
They were wearing bandanas, they were putting stuff around their mouth, they were doing whatever they could.

15:38.660 --> 15:40.660
And this guy's just a little fucking weasel.

15:40.660 --> 15:44.660
If you really want to know how these people think, all you have to do is look at this short exchange.

15:44.660 --> 15:52.660
We are aware of the reopened North Carolina protest that is occurring in downtown Raleigh on Wilmington and Jones Street and are monitoring the situation.

15:52.660 --> 15:56.660
The protesters are in violation of the governor's executive order and have been asked to leave.

15:56.660 --> 15:59.660
What part of the governor's order was violated here?

15:59.660 --> 16:02.660
Protesting is a non-essential activity.

16:02.660 --> 16:05.660
Protesting is the most essential activity.

16:05.660 --> 16:10.660
The people have an inalienable right to petition the government for a redress of their grievances.

16:10.660 --> 16:14.660
This does not go away just because there's an emergency.

16:14.660 --> 16:17.660
It is you corrupt little shits that are non-essential.

16:17.660 --> 16:19.660
It's not just America having this problem, obviously.

16:19.660 --> 16:25.660
And it comes as a man was charged in Sydney after going for a swim at Bondi Beach, seen being pinned to the ground by police.

16:25.660 --> 16:31.660
The 54-year-old man allegedly ignored signs that the beach was closed, entering a sectioned-off area.

16:31.660 --> 16:36.660
I didn't break any law, I didn't climb any fences, I didn't do anything at all.

16:36.660 --> 16:40.660
I was, I had to swim, I had to swim off the rocks.

16:40.660 --> 16:48.660
That police can do something to absolutely model citizen, law-abiding citizen, who never had treat me like absolute animal.

16:49.660 --> 16:57.660
Some eastern suburbs beaches will reopen today for exercise, including Coogee, Maroubra and Clavelli, but sunbathing is still banned.

16:57.660 --> 17:00.660
Look at that beach, dude. There's no one there.

17:00.660 --> 17:04.660
Like, if you show up and you, you know, you flaunt the rules a little bit, you take a dip.

17:04.660 --> 17:08.660
Are you spreading coronavirus? Are you poisoning the ocean with it or something?

17:08.660 --> 17:14.660
If people social distance at the beach, if they social distance while sunbathing or whatever, then whose business is it?

17:14.660 --> 17:17.660
This one's from the UK. I already know it's going to be crazy.

17:17.660 --> 17:19.660
I'm picking up the plan at the same time.

17:19.660 --> 17:26.660
But you were just stood, I wasn't stood here and come out because you was, I was come out because you were stood there saying, talking about is this needed and all that.

17:26.660 --> 17:27.660
That's why I've come out.

17:27.660 --> 17:31.660
No, no way. Give me a ticket for what?

17:31.660 --> 17:32.660
For six hundred and six.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.660
Give me a ticket for what?

17:34.660 --> 17:36.660
You're a board guy.

17:36.660 --> 17:39.660
Are you going to give me an eight out or just lock you up?

17:39.660 --> 17:40.660
Lock me up for what?

17:40.660 --> 17:42.660
Breaking Covid guy, lads.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.660
Listen, put your hands on your head.

17:44.660 --> 17:45.660
Put your hands on your head.

17:45.660 --> 17:47.660
What?

17:47.660 --> 17:57.660
Am I being threatened? Am I being threatened?

17:57.660 --> 18:02.660
You got a bored, lazy police officer just harassing people for the sheer fucking fun of it.

18:02.660 --> 18:04.660
Here's where things start to get crazy.

18:04.660 --> 18:08.660
This guy's getting harassed for walking his dog.

18:08.660 --> 18:11.660
The police just stroll up and ask him for his papers.

18:11.660 --> 18:14.660
Look at me when I'm on the chat, well you're just a bit rude, innit?

18:14.660 --> 18:18.660
Come on, I'm trying to educate you here and you're just looking at your phone, alright?

18:18.660 --> 18:22.660
I don't want to find you sixty pounds, I'm making my way around Denver before you say something.

18:22.660 --> 18:27.660
Educate you? Like it's the state's place to tell you what to fucking think.

18:27.660 --> 18:33.660
When I seen you lot walking around in a group just then, walking all together, not even masks, you're all stood within six feet of me.

18:33.660 --> 18:34.660
You want to buy me a mask, yeah?

18:34.660 --> 18:36.660
You're all within six, you're all within six feet.

18:36.660 --> 18:43.660
It's not his job to buy you a mask, that's your job. In fact, you have a job still, this guy probably doesn't have one.

18:43.660 --> 18:50.660
Right, okay, so while you practice what you preach, yeah I know, you should be filming anyway, you should be filming anyway.

18:50.660 --> 18:53.660
Don't put it on YouTube because my identity is not allowed on YouTube.

18:53.660 --> 18:54.660
Oh.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.660
Hahahaha.

18:56.660 --> 19:01.660
Well, if you want to cross the ocean and try to get me to take the video down, go right the fuck ahead, lady.

19:01.660 --> 19:04.660
Isn't it? 2297, what's your name please?

19:04.660 --> 19:05.660
Sainsbury.

19:05.660 --> 19:06.660
Thank you.

19:06.660 --> 19:07.660
What's your name please?

19:07.660 --> 19:08.660
I'm not going to give it to you, am I?

19:08.660 --> 19:10.660
Well, I actually ended so close, you have to do this.

19:10.660 --> 19:11.660
No, I don't.

19:11.660 --> 19:16.660
I'm actually doing it the best, because I'm actually going to put you down for fine, for being out unnecessarily.

19:16.660 --> 19:19.660
Look at this, he just didn't want to interact with her.

19:19.660 --> 19:26.660
And so she's going to be like, uh, nope, now you have to tell me everything about you, even though there's no fucking probable cause.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.660
Well, you had your dogs not on the lead, just saying.

19:28.660 --> 19:29.660
I haven't got a dog.

19:29.660 --> 19:30.660
Come here, come here.

19:30.660 --> 19:31.660
I haven't got a dog.

19:31.660 --> 19:32.660
I have a piece of dog control, you alright?

19:32.660 --> 19:33.660
What's that?

19:33.660 --> 19:34.660
Well, who of those dogs are yours?

19:35.660 --> 19:36.660
Come here, come here.

19:36.660 --> 19:40.660
He was discussing a dog last night, which is day-to-day business.

19:40.660 --> 19:43.660
Day-to-day business is banned.

19:43.660 --> 19:46.660
Well, I don't care if you walk around with dogs, not on a leash, you walk around with dogs.

19:46.660 --> 19:48.660
Don't yell at me, because that's not going to work.

19:48.660 --> 19:50.660
I don't care what you're going to do, alright?

19:50.660 --> 19:52.660
Don't have such a bad attitude, okay?

19:52.660 --> 19:54.660
You're going to have to arrest me.

19:54.660 --> 19:55.660
For what?

19:55.660 --> 19:56.660
Exactly, for what?

19:56.660 --> 19:57.660
For what?

19:57.660 --> 19:58.660
For what, exactly.

19:58.660 --> 19:59.660
You'll have to arrest me.

19:59.660 --> 20:01.660
Yeah, this is how you do it, man.

20:01.660 --> 20:02.660
This is how you deal with it.

20:02.660 --> 20:09.660
Maybe not necessarily as combative as this guy if you're in the States, but you definitely politely but firmly exercise your rights.

20:09.660 --> 20:11.660
Don't consent to talking to the cops, guys.

20:11.660 --> 20:15.660
If they're going to arrest you, they're going to arrest you, and you can argue it later.

20:19.660 --> 20:20.660
Listen to the police.

20:20.660 --> 20:25.660
You walk up to me without masks, and you walk up, and you're within six foot of each other, and you're within six foot of me.

20:25.660 --> 20:27.660
Practice what you preach.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.660
I'm not within six foot of anyone.

20:29.660 --> 20:30.660
You came to me.

20:33.660 --> 20:34.660
You came to me.

20:37.660 --> 20:38.660
Does it matter?

20:38.660 --> 20:39.660
My dog with me?

20:39.660 --> 20:40.660
My dog's exercising.

20:40.660 --> 20:42.660
My dog's running around.

20:43.660 --> 20:44.660
I'm not going home.

20:44.660 --> 20:45.660
I'm exercising.

20:47.660 --> 20:48.660
Make your hour.

20:48.660 --> 20:50.660
Are we living in Nazi Germany or something?

20:53.660 --> 20:54.660
It's a guideline.

20:54.660 --> 20:55.660
Guideline.

20:55.660 --> 20:56.660
You just said the words.

20:56.660 --> 20:57.660
Guideline.

20:57.660 --> 20:59.660
It's a fucking guideline, dude.

20:59.660 --> 21:03.660
Like she has the actual authority to tell him how long he can stay outside.

21:03.660 --> 21:04.660
Fuck you.

21:04.660 --> 21:07.660
Please don't step any closer towards me.

21:07.660 --> 21:08.660
Please don't step any...

21:08.660 --> 21:09.660
Look at this.

21:09.660 --> 21:10.660
Look at this now.

21:10.660 --> 21:11.660
Look at how close she's getting.

21:11.660 --> 21:12.660
Look how close she's getting.

21:12.660 --> 21:14.660
Yeah, now stay where you are.

21:14.660 --> 21:16.660
I'm exercising my dog.

21:17.660 --> 21:19.660
Well, why didn't you do your job?

21:19.660 --> 21:20.660
What do you mean?

21:20.660 --> 21:21.660
I'm walking my dog.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.660
My dog was running around me.

21:24.660 --> 21:25.660
And then you came up.

21:25.660 --> 21:26.660
You came up without masks.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.660
Within three foot of each other.

21:28.660 --> 21:29.660
Within three foot of me.

21:29.660 --> 21:30.660
Exactly.

21:30.660 --> 21:31.660
Practice what you preach.

21:33.660 --> 21:34.660
I don't sunbathe.

21:35.660 --> 21:36.660
That's breaking the law.

21:36.660 --> 21:37.660
What's breaking the law?

21:37.660 --> 21:38.660
Sunbathing.

21:38.660 --> 21:39.660
Sunbathing?

21:39.660 --> 21:40.660
Yeah, alright.

21:40.660 --> 21:41.660
Look how covered I am.

21:42.660 --> 21:43.660
Sunbathing.

21:43.660 --> 21:44.660
I've got a hoodie.

21:46.660 --> 21:47.660
She's reaching now.

21:47.660 --> 21:49.660
She just wants to fuck this guy somehow.

21:49.660 --> 21:53.660
She claims he's sunbathing when he's wearing a hoodie.

21:53.660 --> 21:54.660
But still, you know what?

21:54.660 --> 21:58.660
If you're social distancing and you decide to sunbathe,

21:58.660 --> 22:00.660
whose fucking business is that?

22:00.660 --> 22:01.660
Christ, man.

22:01.660 --> 22:03.660
Yo, have a word with yourself.

22:03.660 --> 22:08.660
A guideline is something that the government wants the people to do.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.660
Thinks it would be in their best interest to do.

22:10.660 --> 22:13.660
But that's not because there'll be punishments from the state if they don't do it.

22:13.660 --> 22:16.660
It's because it's a good idea for themselves.

22:16.660 --> 22:19.660
The police are not meant to enforce guidelines.

22:19.660 --> 22:21.660
They're meant to enforce the law.

22:21.660 --> 22:22.660
Oh, hey.

22:22.660 --> 22:26.660
You want to watch them kick down random people's doors to see if there's parties going on?

22:28.660 --> 22:29.660
Right.

22:30.660 --> 22:31.660
Listen to us.

22:31.660 --> 22:32.660
Hello?

22:32.660 --> 22:33.660
We went to court, haven't we?

22:33.660 --> 22:34.660
Because we went to court, but otherwise.

22:34.660 --> 22:35.660
No.

22:35.660 --> 22:36.660
There might be something going on in here, so.

22:36.660 --> 22:37.660
You alright?

22:37.660 --> 22:38.660
We need to double check.

22:38.660 --> 22:39.660
What do you want?

22:39.660 --> 22:41.660
I appreciate what you're saying about social distancing, so I'm keeping the distance.

22:41.660 --> 22:42.660
Yeah?

22:42.660 --> 22:43.660
Yeah, fuck off.

22:43.660 --> 22:45.660
Right, so we need to check the group and make sure nothing's going on.

22:45.660 --> 22:46.660
No, no, no.

22:46.660 --> 22:47.660
Watch your name.

22:47.660 --> 22:48.660
Stay away from me.

22:48.660 --> 22:49.660
Watch your name.

22:49.660 --> 22:50.660
Doesn't matter.

22:50.660 --> 22:51.660
What are you doing in my house?

22:51.660 --> 22:52.660
What are you doing in my house?

22:52.660 --> 22:53.660
What are you doing in my house?

22:53.660 --> 22:54.660
I just explained to you.

22:54.660 --> 22:55.660
What are you doing in my house?

22:55.660 --> 22:56.660
I just explained to you why we're here.

22:56.660 --> 22:57.660
We've had to call them.

22:57.660 --> 22:58.660
It's a disturbance.

22:58.660 --> 22:59.660
That's why we're here.

22:59.660 --> 23:00.660
What?

23:00.660 --> 23:01.660
So you kicked my door in?

23:01.660 --> 23:03.660
Should you have opened the door?

23:03.660 --> 23:04.660
No.

23:04.660 --> 23:08.660
So they kicked this guy's door down because they think there's a party going on, and now

23:08.660 --> 23:10.660
they're just going to search his house.

23:10.660 --> 23:13.660
This is, unironically, some fascist shit.

23:13.660 --> 23:18.000
I know that that term's kind of been diluted recently because on the radical left side

23:18.000 --> 23:21.240
of things, they call everything that's not them a fascist.

23:21.240 --> 23:25.500
But the police ignoring people's property rights and simply walking around like they

23:25.500 --> 23:28.600
own the place all the time, public or private land, doesn't matter?

23:28.600 --> 23:29.600
Yeah, that's pretty fascist.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.600
Can I explain that to you?

23:30.600 --> 23:31.600
No!

23:31.600 --> 23:36.600
I told you why I wouldn't open the door is because of what is going on with this virus.

23:36.600 --> 23:37.600
Now, fuck off.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.600
You can get out of here.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.600
One time's satisfied.

23:39.600 --> 23:40.600
You might have it.

23:40.600 --> 23:41.600
Fucking no.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.600
One time's satisfied.

23:42.600 --> 23:43.600
Everything's all right.

23:43.600 --> 23:44.600
No way.

23:44.600 --> 23:45.600
Come on.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.600
Get in here, dickhead.

23:46.600 --> 23:47.600
Go on.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.200
Have a look.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.200
Just check it.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.200
Have a look, dickhead.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.200
All right.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.760
See, you probably shouldn't have said, have a look, dickhead.

23:53.760 --> 23:57.280
That can be construed as giving consent after the fact.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.200
He should be objecting this whole fucking time.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.660
But yeah, like, he refused to open the door.

24:01.660 --> 24:03.200
They broke down the door.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.460
Jesus.

24:04.460 --> 24:05.760
There's no probable cause for this.

24:05.760 --> 24:06.760
There's no fucking warrant.

24:06.760 --> 24:07.760
Yeah.

24:07.760 --> 24:08.760
Yeah.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.760
No point only in here, is there?

24:10.760 --> 24:17.080
So what do you mean putting me door through, fucking door?

24:17.560 --> 24:19.560
You're fucking pathetic.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.560
Get out of here.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.560
You absolute disgrace.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.560
And you've got nothing else to do.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.560
You've put my fucking door through.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.560
I hope you're going to fucking...

24:29.560 --> 24:33.560
What are you going to fucking do to that?

24:33.560 --> 24:38.560
Oh, shut your fucking mouth, you fucking brain dead cunt.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.560
Get out.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.560
Holy shit, dude.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.560
I get it.

24:43.560 --> 24:44.560
I get why he's mad.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.560
It's legitimate, but it's just kind of funny to hear.

24:47.040 --> 24:50.040
Fucking pay, what, 20 grand a year to be a fucking knobhead.

24:50.040 --> 24:51.040
Fuck off.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.040
Get out.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.040
Am I fucking out?

24:54.040 --> 24:56.040
Get the fuck out.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.040
What are you?

24:57.040 --> 24:58.040
Bye.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.040
Bye.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.040
Fucking idiots.

25:04.040 --> 25:06.040
Broke me fucking door.

25:06.040 --> 25:10.040
Look at the fucking state of this.

25:10.040 --> 25:12.040
Huh?

25:12.040 --> 25:15.040
British fucking police.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.520
Look at the fucking state of it.

25:18.520 --> 25:21.520
You fucking knobheads.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.520
Fuck my life.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.520
Holy shit, dude.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.520
Yeah, they total his door.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.520
He can't close it now.

25:29.520 --> 25:31.520
He can't lock it now.

25:31.520 --> 25:32.520
Now he's going to get robbed.

25:32.520 --> 25:36.520
Oh, and by the way, some places have publicly said that they just don't have the manpower

25:36.520 --> 25:38.520
to stop robberies anymore.

25:38.520 --> 25:41.520
So if someone's robbing you and you call the police, they just can't show up.

25:41.520 --> 25:44.520
Great time to leave somebody with no fucking door then.

25:45.000 --> 25:50.760
With techs doing their part too, landing AI has developed a tool that ensures people keep

25:50.760 --> 25:52.040
their social distance.

25:52.040 --> 25:56.640
The green blocks are people who have kept social distance and the red blocks are people

25:56.640 --> 25:57.740
who aren't.

25:57.740 --> 26:03.600
And you can see on the bird's eye view where the red blocks are too close to some people.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.040
Thanks big tech.

26:05.040 --> 26:09.360
Now the police can just monitor every street and give everyone tickets all the fucking

26:09.360 --> 26:10.360
time.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.000
Google's getting in on it too.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.800
Google's sharing Canadian's location data with the government, but says the privacy

26:15.800 --> 26:16.800
is assured.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.720
How is the privacy assured if you're sharing it with the government?

26:19.720 --> 26:21.120
It's already been shared.

26:21.120 --> 26:24.600
Let's see what they're actually implementing in all of these locations.

26:24.600 --> 26:28.120
These are the fines you can get in Toronto and Ontario for coronavirus right now.

26:28.120 --> 26:33.380
Residents of Toronto are required to follow the newly implemented social distancing by-law.

26:33.380 --> 26:37.580
The by-law requires any two people who don't live together to keep two meters of distance

26:37.580 --> 26:40.640
between them and a park or public square.

26:40.800 --> 26:46.080
Anyone who fails to comply with the new by-law can receive a maximum set fine of $1,000.

26:46.080 --> 26:51.160
Police officers across Ontario are enforcing provincial orders banning organized social

26:51.160 --> 26:56.120
gatherings of more than five people as well as bans on using closed playgrounds in other

26:56.120 --> 26:57.120
parks.

26:57.120 --> 27:01.320
The city is also issuing fines to non-essential businesses that remain open despite provincial

27:01.320 --> 27:02.720
orders to shut down.

27:02.720 --> 27:06.000
In London, go engulfing on that $750 fine.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.280
Doesn't matter if the course is closed and therefore empty and therefore no one is

27:11.280 --> 27:14.320
getting infected, $750.

27:14.320 --> 27:21.040
The city of Laredo, Texas has mandated that people wear masks in public or face a $1,000

27:21.040 --> 27:22.040
fine.

27:22.040 --> 27:27.360
The fines for not complying with social distancing rules in Vancouver is also $1,000.

27:27.360 --> 27:30.000
For businesses, it's $50,000.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.320
Fifty-nine charges have already been laid in Hamilton, including against seven businesses.

27:35.320 --> 27:41.600
Hamilton has 331 cases and 16 deaths, while its population is half a million.

27:41.600 --> 27:45.120
Let's see if these various new restrictions are bearing any fruit.

27:45.120 --> 27:51.280
First, UK arrest for failing to self-isolate over the coronavirus as man at 26 is held

27:51.280 --> 27:52.600
on the Isle of Man.

27:52.600 --> 27:59.640
A 26-year-old male faces a 10,000-pound fine and three months in jail after arriving on

27:59.640 --> 28:03.400
the Isle of Man then refusing to go into a 14-day quarantine.

28:03.400 --> 28:07.500
The Quebec City Police arrest a coronavirus patient for defying her quarantine.

28:07.500 --> 28:10.120
She tested positive but was still going around town.

28:10.120 --> 28:15.560
A coronavirus patient is now under 24-7 armed guard after refusing to self-isolate.

28:15.560 --> 28:19.680
The governor of the state of Kentucky had to make this decision because the person just

28:19.680 --> 28:21.080
would not stay indoors.

28:21.080 --> 28:25.160
Now, I kind of get it when it's somebody who's actually been confirmed to have the

28:25.160 --> 28:28.960
virus, but it's happening to just random people, too.

28:28.960 --> 28:34.960
In the UK, a woman was wrongly charged £660 under a new coronavirus law.

28:34.960 --> 28:40.480
Two women in Texas were arrested for offering home beauty and salon services out of their

28:40.480 --> 28:41.480
house.

28:41.480 --> 28:46.280
They were in fact discovered by undercover cops who posed as customers.

28:46.280 --> 28:52.120
Six people were shot at a California house party that violated the stay-at-home order.

28:52.120 --> 28:54.320
The victims were five adults and one juvenile.

28:54.360 --> 29:01.560
A driver-in-training was fined $1600 for non-essential travel during the coronavirus lockdown.

29:01.560 --> 29:07.920
It really does seem like they're going after everybody, but actually it's not everybody.

29:07.920 --> 29:13.000
The police let a wedding with 30 guests and a drummer go ahead in Melbourne despite a

29:13.000 --> 29:19.320
ban on ceremonies with more than five guests, just telling them to keep 1.5 metres apart.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.720
Check out this wedding picture, guys.

29:20.720 --> 29:24.280
I mean, you think there might be something about this as to why they're not enforcing

29:24.280 --> 29:25.280
the rules equally?

29:25.280 --> 29:28.680
You think it's just random chance or you think something might be going on here?

29:28.680 --> 29:30.720
I don't know.

29:30.720 --> 29:35.760
A French official says the quarantine should not be enforced in migrant areas to avoid

29:35.760 --> 29:36.760
riots.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.360
It's not a priority to enforce closings in certain neighbourhoods.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.840
Is that all it takes?

29:40.840 --> 29:43.480
In order for us to get our rights back, all we have to do is riot?

29:43.480 --> 29:44.780
Really, is that it?

29:44.780 --> 29:47.160
Or maybe it's just riot while not being white.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.720
There are two headlines, though, that are absolutely insane.

29:49.720 --> 29:51.900
We should blow up the bridges.

29:51.900 --> 29:54.520
Coronavirus leads to class warfare in Hamptons.

29:54.520 --> 29:57.160
I guess they don't want people coming to town.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.240
And check out this Nazi shit.

29:59.240 --> 30:04.960
Montana County demands people wear government-issued armbands to do business.

30:04.960 --> 30:05.960
Wow.

30:05.960 --> 30:11.040
You literally have to have your papers, not just your papers, but your Nazi armband in

30:11.040 --> 30:13.800
order to buy and sell in this area.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.920
This flyer was given to all the businesses in the area.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.960
Did you see a pink wristband in Valley County?

30:19.960 --> 30:21.360
What does it mean?

30:21.360 --> 30:25.760
Anyone who is from out of town or out of Valley County who has a pink wristband has been here

30:25.760 --> 30:29.700
14 days or more, and no longer needs to do the strict self-quarantine.

30:29.700 --> 30:32.060
They may enter your business.

30:32.060 --> 30:36.720
Anyone who is from out of town or out of Valley County, staying here or working here, and

30:36.720 --> 30:42.200
has not completed the 14-day quarantine is required by the Valley County Health Officer

30:42.200 --> 30:45.680
Order to use curbside delivery only.

30:45.680 --> 30:49.000
They are not to enter your business to shop.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.880
Someone working on each shift must talk to the people and insist that they follow the

30:52.880 --> 30:53.880
orders.

30:53.880 --> 30:58.920
If, after explaining the requirements, the person doesn't comply, you are to call law

30:58.920 --> 30:59.960
enforcement.

30:59.960 --> 31:03.000
This is probably the most draconian thing to come out of this so far.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.480
Of course, the internet knows exactly how to strike back against this kind of nonsense.

31:06.480 --> 31:09.240
Like when New York City's mayor put this up.

31:09.240 --> 31:12.400
How do you report places that aren't enforcing social distancing?

31:12.400 --> 31:13.400
It's simple.

31:13.400 --> 31:16.120
Snap a photo and text it to 311692.

31:16.120 --> 31:20.200
Well, no one's surprised that this happened, right?

31:20.200 --> 31:26.160
de Blasio's social distancing tip line was flooded with penis photos and Hitler memes.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.680
Thank you 4chan.

31:27.680 --> 31:32.600
Mayor Bill de Blasio's critics let him know how they really felt about him, ordering New

31:32.600 --> 31:36.440
Yorkers to snitch on each other for violating social distancing rules.

31:36.440 --> 31:42.320
By flooding his new tip line with crank complaints including dick pics and people flipping the

31:42.320 --> 31:48.280
bird, photos of extended middle fingers, the mayor dropping the Staten Island groundhog,

31:48.280 --> 31:53.160
and news coverage of him going to the gym have all been texted to a special tip line

31:53.160 --> 31:56.440
that de Blasio announced Saturday.

31:56.440 --> 32:02.600
Fuck you, replied Morden L. Schmidt 1, along with a meme showing Adolf Hitler and the words,

32:02.600 --> 32:07.060
To those turning in your neighbors and local businesses, you did the right thing.

32:07.060 --> 32:12.000
Other profane messages included a photo of a bowl of gummy candies in the shape of many

32:12.000 --> 32:21.480
male genitalia and a sign saying eat a bag of dicks.

32:21.480 --> 32:27.200
He looked at me and coofed in my direction, the caller said, according to a photo of the

32:27.200 --> 32:29.920
311 operator's computer screen.

32:29.920 --> 32:36.720
Coof is a newly coined term for coughing while infected with the coronavirus.

32:36.720 --> 32:41.560
I love it when like old style media tries to report on memes.

32:41.560 --> 32:46.420
It's been hilarious shit for years man, even going back to the whole exploding van, lulls

32:46.420 --> 32:51.160
is a corruption of lol, kinda stuff that we saw from Fox News in like 2007 or whatever

32:51.160 --> 32:52.160
it was.

32:52.160 --> 32:56.240
And yes, at this point they actually are mask off tyrants.

32:56.240 --> 33:02.520
Michigan governor considers extending the coronavirus restrictions because of the protesters.

33:02.520 --> 33:06.880
Not for any other reason, not because Michigan for some reason needs it, not for any kind

33:06.880 --> 33:11.380
of health or economic reason or whatever, just because people protested.

33:11.380 --> 33:15.620
This is very much like a one more word from you mister and you're on the ground for another

33:15.620 --> 33:16.980
3 months kind of deal.

33:16.980 --> 33:22.180
And I'm not at all surprised because the democratic governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, actually

33:22.180 --> 33:23.180
looks like a Karen.

33:23.180 --> 33:29.380
It's that kind of irresponsible action that puts us in this situation where we might have

33:29.380 --> 33:34.540
to actually think about extending stay home orders, which is supposedly what they were

33:34.540 --> 33:35.540
protesting.

33:35.540 --> 33:37.260
Thanks mom, I hate it.

33:37.260 --> 33:41.100
And some people really are crying out for the government to be their parent, to swoop

33:41.100 --> 33:46.160
in and save them and coddle them and restrict them the way that a parent would.

33:46.160 --> 33:50.300
To beat this coronavirus we must sacrifice our freedoms.

33:50.300 --> 33:56.900
South Korea, China, Singapore and Taiwan have demonstrated that draconian methods like tracking

33:56.900 --> 34:00.180
people with technology work.

34:00.180 --> 34:01.180
Have they?

34:01.180 --> 34:04.860
Because we all know that China's cooking the numbers, and we've seen a natural decline

34:04.860 --> 34:10.420
in the acceleration of cases all over the world, whether or not they actually used draconian

34:10.420 --> 34:11.420
methods.

34:11.420 --> 34:17.060
This disease is so infectious, governments must unleash the big brother bazooka by deploying

34:17.060 --> 34:18.140
technology.

34:18.140 --> 34:21.020
This is the only way to fully halt the contagion.

34:21.020 --> 34:23.940
Testing must be universal and mandatory.

34:23.940 --> 34:29.300
Smartphones and other devices can help authorities monitor people's movements in order to enforce

34:29.300 --> 34:32.220
social distancing and prevent them from gathering.

34:32.220 --> 34:36.700
Data on the movements of those who are quarantined or known to be infected can help authorities

34:36.700 --> 34:39.300
track down who's been exposed.

34:39.300 --> 34:42.960
Infected Koreans are separated from their family and friends and put into government

34:42.960 --> 34:45.020
isolation shelters.

34:45.020 --> 34:49.520
Their phone and credit card data is used by health authorities to trace their movements

34:49.520 --> 34:51.800
and contacts.

34:51.800 --> 34:56.500
Every contact or person in the vicinity of their journeys is sent a warning on their

34:56.500 --> 35:02.340
phones and told they must quarantine themselves at home, where they are monitored by a GPS

35:02.340 --> 35:03.340
app.

35:03.340 --> 35:05.540
If they leave home, they face huge fines.

35:05.540 --> 35:11.340
The Chinese require anyone who's tested positive, is isolated or has been exposed to victims

35:11.340 --> 35:16.380
to download software on their smartphones that allows police to access a colour code

35:16.380 --> 35:20.280
that defines their health status and whether they should be in quarantine or free to use

35:20.280 --> 35:21.760
public spaces.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.300
These measures are not overkill.

35:24.300 --> 35:28.380
Canadians are mostly compliant, but many need more discipline.

35:28.380 --> 35:33.980
We've all seen reckless people on beaches and parks, oblivious to the wellbeing of others.

35:33.980 --> 35:38.740
Many are refusing to stay home, keep their distance from others or are gathering privately.

35:38.740 --> 35:44.140
All of these people are potential spreaders, or as one headline labelled them, Covidiots.

35:44.140 --> 35:50.900
Laws with fines and punishments already exist but aren't working, nor is public shaming.

35:50.900 --> 35:54.820
Using Canadians using technology will keep everyone honest.

35:54.820 --> 36:00.360
Skittishness about privacy or freedom are valid concerns, but the status quo dictates

36:00.360 --> 36:03.300
that extraordinary action must be undertaken.

36:03.300 --> 36:07.900
This also means truly sealing our borders until the crisis is over.

36:07.900 --> 36:13.240
The fact is that freedom is the right to swing your arm, but not to hit anyone with it.

36:13.240 --> 36:18.280
And privacy is a cherished privilege, but only if it causes no harm.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.600
This is the socialist paradise.

36:20.600 --> 36:25.820
This is what every young leftist has been screaming about wanting for the past decade.

36:25.820 --> 36:30.960
Capitalism has been broken, at least temporarily, replaced by state control of everything.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.880
Freedoms are curtailed for, supposedly, the greater good.

36:33.880 --> 36:37.080
Earning your own money has been replaced with government handouts.

36:37.080 --> 36:42.320
The newly 18 year old socialists were promised paradise, but the realities of this level

36:42.320 --> 36:44.820
of government control are actually quite bleak.

36:44.820 --> 36:50.160
The left has been saying for a while now that they could actually create utopia on earth,

36:50.160 --> 36:54.600
as long as the average person simply surrendered their basic rights to government control and

36:54.600 --> 36:57.640
accepted the nationalization of everything.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.440
And here we are.

36:59.440 --> 37:03.920
Governments around the world, both autocratic and democratic, have begun to seize power

37:03.920 --> 37:06.320
and issue authoritarian crackdowns.

37:06.320 --> 37:10.060
Who knows how many of them will actually give up all of this emergency authority once the

37:10.060 --> 37:12.580
coronavirus crisis has run its course.

37:12.580 --> 37:16.720
Our cities now have an extra police presence, sometimes even an extra military presence

37:16.720 --> 37:17.720
in them.

37:17.720 --> 37:22.760
That force will be wielded by the same people that have closed our schools, our businesses,

37:22.760 --> 37:27.720
our churches, our public spaces, our gyms, our libraries, and our clubs.

37:27.720 --> 37:33.120
We still don't know just how far they're willing to go in using that military force to try

37:33.120 --> 37:35.120
to keep people off the streets.

37:35.120 --> 37:41.120
But we are being asked by both the state, and frankly, the dumber segments of our population,

37:41.120 --> 37:45.680
to simply accept it, and to hope that the people in charge come good on their promise

37:45.680 --> 37:47.780
to give our civil liberties back.

37:47.780 --> 37:49.120
It's not all bad.

37:49.120 --> 37:52.680
It is true that there are definitely some civil servants out there who are acting out

37:52.680 --> 37:57.760
of a genuine, urgent need to keep people safe right now during a crisis.

37:57.760 --> 38:02.540
But there's just as many hidden authoritarians that are salivating at the prospect of keeping

38:02.540 --> 38:04.240
people in their place.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.520
Don't let them do it.

38:05.520 --> 38:06.520
Protest.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.680
And protest doesn't mean go out there and get into violent brawls with the cops or throw

38:09.680 --> 38:12.840
a brick at them or something, because then it becomes a riot.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.640
Then you've actually broken the law and done something wrong.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.800
Still protesting means that you're willing to get arrested.

38:17.800 --> 38:20.000
It means that you're potentially willing to have a record.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.060
Say what you want about Bernie Sanders, but those old pictures of him being dragged away

38:24.060 --> 38:28.360
by the cops because he was peacefully protesting in what he believed?

38:28.360 --> 38:32.440
That is the kind of thing that you have to do right now, if protest is your aim.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.640
You have to be willing to spend a night or two in jail.

38:34.640 --> 38:38.160
But as long as you don't forfeit the high ground, it will probably be better for you

38:38.160 --> 38:39.160
in the end.

38:39.160 --> 38:41.960
A couple months ago on this channel I was talking about how it was probably a good idea

38:41.960 --> 38:42.960
to shut things down.

38:43.160 --> 38:45.720
And I actually still agree with that because the whole point of shutting society down,

38:45.720 --> 38:50.480
at least temporarily, and using federal power to grant that authority, it's not because

38:50.480 --> 38:52.480
there's a coronavirus pandemic.

38:52.480 --> 38:57.720
It's because there's a pandemic of an unknown virus that we have no idea how to combat.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.120
But now we do, at least somewhat.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.280
We have some ideas.

39:01.280 --> 39:02.680
We know a little bit more about it.

39:02.680 --> 39:06.680
Shutting things down was meant to buy us time so that we could actually study this virus,

39:06.680 --> 39:09.300
learn what was going on with it, and figure out what to do about it.

39:09.300 --> 39:11.040
We are largely at that stage.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.480
We don't have a vaccine yet, but we do have some effective treatments.

39:14.480 --> 39:19.440
Our manufacturing capacity has ramped up again, such that the shortages of masks and ventilators,

39:19.440 --> 39:23.020
as well as stuff like food and toilet paper, has largely gone away.

39:23.020 --> 39:26.960
Now is the time to open back up, because we've figured out what to do about it and now we

39:26.960 --> 39:27.960
can do it.

39:27.960 --> 39:30.960
And there is no good reason to stay indoors anymore.

39:30.960 --> 39:36.220
Even if there is this dreaded second wave, dealing with the second wave is better than

39:36.220 --> 39:37.840
giving up our rights.

39:37.840 --> 39:41.880
Because if those rights are actually gone, they're gone for everyone, not just people

39:41.880 --> 39:44.860
who are infected, and they could be gone for a generation.

39:44.860 --> 39:48.000
We are actually living in the socialist paradise.

39:48.000 --> 39:53.060
It is no wonder that not only does nobody like it, but that governments around the world

39:53.060 --> 39:58.680
are turning into, at various speeds, the exact type of thing that we need to prevent.

40:08.340 --> 40:11.340
All humans must keep indoors.

40:11.340 --> 40:16.340
All humans must go by the lights, by order of the direct.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.340
All humans must keep indoors.

40:20.340 --> 40:25.840
All humans must go by the lights, by order of the direct.
