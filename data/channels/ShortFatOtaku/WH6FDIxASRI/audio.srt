1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,160
Another E3 has come and gone, my friends.

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,280
As always, I streamed all of the conferences live on my gaming channel, Game Boomers, and

3
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,640
there's a link in the description if you'd like to see them for yourself.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,300
But all in all, it was a rather lackluster E3.

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:32,720
Not too many interesting games, and not too many hilariously cringey moments.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,160
Seemed rather soulless, in fact.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,640
But there was certainly a lot of social justice influence in games this year.

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,080
And let's take a peek at that, one company at a time.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:48,840
Electronic Arts.

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,000
The only interesting game to come out of EA this year was Jedi Fallen Order, and even

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,360
then I'm really stretching it calling it interesting.

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,980
The combat plays generically, the stealth looks forced, the cutscenes are quite wooden.

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,040
The entire game, at least the part that EA had to show, was a generic on-rails adventure

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,840
that alternated between story cinematics and bland action set pieces that only served as

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,800
a bridge to the next story cinematic.

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,080
It doesn't even feel like Star Wars, not really.

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,980
It feels like a generic third-person action game wearing a Star Wars robe.

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,580
But to talk about Star Wars, we have to talk about Disney.

19
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,240
When Episode VII came out, Disney declared that the entirety of the Star Wars Extended

20
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,560
Canon was struck from the record, both before and after the original movies.

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,600
So no Grand Admiral Thrawn, no Knights of the Old Republic, and worst of all, no Shadows

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,600
of the Empire.

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,840
In its place, we got the new Disney Canon, complete with Han Solo, Mireille Su, whatever

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,440
the fuck this is, an inexplicably bad writing designed to subvert expectations but not actually

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,080
make any narrative sense.

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,280
Jedi Fallen Order is in the new Disney Canon of Star Wars.

27
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,280
That's a big problem itself, but SJWs still aren't satisfied with it.

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,920
Some fans upset Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order protagonist is a white guy.

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,480
Fallen Order looks fun but do I really need another white male Jedi?

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,960
Kinda disappointing that player character is a generic video game white guy.

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,040
The Jedi Fallen Order trailer is enticing enough, I just have trouble getting excited

32
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,920
about playing a broody white dude.

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Jedi Fallen Order, here, play as this nondescript white guy and only him, no customization.

34
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,820
Uh, you're not a vampire princess, dude.

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,340
In fact, you're all white males and we need to hear from you less so how about you just

36
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,340
shut up.

37
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,780
I wouldn't characterize SJWs as fans.

38
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,940
They don't watch the movies, play the games, obsess over the lore, or join the fandom.

39
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,620
They just police creators, forcing their political worldview into everything they can, and calling

40
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,200
people bigots if they resist.

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,620
They don't actually care about the communities that they shit up.

42
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,300
They're happy to destroy a franchise as long as they're the ones who rule over its demise.

43
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,240
That's why nobody went to see Ghostbusters 2016, or why the Boba Fett Star Wars movie

44
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,080
was cancelled after Han Solo's box office failure.

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,880
They're not fans, they're just agitators, and there's no money to be made in bowing

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
to them.

47
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,800
In fact, the far superior Star Wars-related announcement, this E3, was that Limited Run

48
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,240
Games is releasing a compilation of old, remastered Star Wars games, including the old Nintendo

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,360
game, Episode I Racer, and yes, thank you God, Shadows of the Empire on the N64.

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Fuck Disney, man.

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
Microsoft.

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:32,120
The Xbox conference was pretty cool.

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,400
It seems as if the massive failure of the Xbox One has kind of humbled Microsoft a bit.

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,740
Their next generation console, Project Scarlet, is on paper impressive, though let's see

55
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,300
if they can actually pull it off.

56
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,620
And then there's the immortal meme that is Keanu Reeves appearing in Cyberpunk 2077.

57
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,660
You might remember Cyberpunk 2077 as one of the most anticipated games in years.

58
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,420
I know I've got my pre-order ready.

59
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,460
But you also might remember it as the topic of a Eurogamer interview from last year, where

60
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,700
the gender ideologue masquerading as a legitimate journalist grilled the devs over at CD Projekt

61
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,580
Red over trans ideology.

62
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,660
If someone wanted to choose a character that was gender fluid, how would you portray that?

63
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,460
You know, as an example in the character creation, you can do that by not calling the type of

64
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,800
body you choose, man or woman, but just title it as body type.

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,660
And then, from a male or female body type, you can, on this basis, choose how to make

66
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,660
your character.

67
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,520
Beyond the aesthetics, could you choose to have a different pronoun?

68
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,740
Is that an option in the game?

69
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,100
I honestly don't know yet.

70
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,540
What I can say was that it was a part of Cyberpunk 2020, but how exactly will we do it in Cyberpunk

71
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,540
2077?

72
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,540
I don't know yet.

73
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,000
But it is definitely a thing we're aware of.

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,660
I know plenty of fans who would appreciate that, after all.

75
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,980
You have a main character with a name that doesn't specify any gender.

76
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,980
Well, exactly.

77
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,980
That's why we chose that name, because V works for male, it works for female, and we

78
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,140
thought it would be a good option.

79
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,580
For gender fluid as well?

80
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,580
Yeah.

81
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,260
I can only imagine how awkward this sounded IRL.

82
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,740
It already oozes cringe in text form.

83
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,760
This sounds like the morality police coming around to ensure that you're doing everything

84
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,360
according to progressive principles.

85
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,540
Like those videos of Sharia watchdogs in ISIS controlled territories, stopping people on

86
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,580
the street or going shop to shop, ensuring that everybody's thinking is properly checked

87
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,580
and corrected.

88
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,500
A large part of the Hizbah's role is also assuring that the shops and stalls throughout

89
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,700
the city are trading fairly.

90
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,780
The patrol go door to door inspecting products, practices, and pricing.

91
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,900
Like oh, make sure it's for gender fluid as well, we'll come down on you for your sins

92
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,900
if it's not.

93
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,220
So when footage of Cyberpunk came out, SJWs flocked to this advertisement in the background,

94
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,220
calling it transphobic.

95
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,900
It's an ad for a drink with the slogan, mix it up, and mentioning 16 different available

96
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,900
flavors.

97
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,580
It looks like there's a bulge there, which is probably why they're calling it transphobic.

98
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,500
The activists getting angry at this ad are missing the point.

99
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,380
The artist who created it said that her intent was in fact to reflect the dystopian state

100
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,980
of a world in the grip of omnipresent all-powerful corporations.

101
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,220
It's shocking, over-the-top, and exploitative.

102
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,460
And yes, that's the point.

103
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,420
You guys do realize that Cyberpunk is a hyper-capitalist dystopian setting, right?

104
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,500
The kind of thing your socialist brethren screech about non-stop?

105
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,980
Do you think such a world would give two flying fucks about your theories of oppression and

106
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,980
privilege?

107
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,420
But even more basic than that, if there weren't trans people in the game, they'd still complain.

108
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,220
And now that there's trans people, visible trans people, you can't get more visible

109
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,580
than a dick girl, really.

110
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,900
The trans visibility issue is solved.

111
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,300
And now they're wanting that they're visible, or sorry, they're exploited now.

112
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,620
Well, I've got news for you.

113
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,140
In a visual medium, there's three ways to represent trans people.

114
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,040
One, make them perfectly passing and never bring it up, in which case they may as well

115
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
be cis.

116
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,400
Two, make them varying levels of passing, which is frankly more realistic, but then

117
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,960
you cry about exploitation because the audience can tell their trans at a glance due to physical

118
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
features.

119
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,880
Or three, make them perfectly passing and make their trans status a story point reinforced

120
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,300
only by dialogue, which would make the issue shoehorned and massively drop the quality

121
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,300
of writing.

122
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,080
By the way, the reason most woke media sucks is because they always choose option three.

123
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,640
Oh, and in case you didn't pick up that this was all just self-serving tripe, Anna

124
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,840
Valens, one of the people spearheading the charge of drummed-up outrage against this

125
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,080
ad, also took the opportunity to advance her own shit game, Blood Pact, an erotic game

126
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,200
about two trans women and their very visible boners.

127
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,880
How exploitative of you, Anna.

128
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,800
Trans activists are also mad because if you use futuristic tech to achieve a sex change,

129
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,640
you lose a part of your humanity stat.

130
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,800
What they fail to realize is that all futuristic body mods come with a humanity drop.

131
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,960
It's part of the balance and the theming of the game, that replacing parts of your

132
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,240
body with technology comes with ups and downs.

133
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,000
Look, I thought Cyberpunk looked cool too, but I really do not want this to be ignored,

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,160
especially by trans people who may be affected by it.

135
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,720
It's an unfortunate fact of reality that, even today, you have to get some kind of basic

136
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,860
body mod in order to transition, just like how you might have to get a joint replaced

137
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,320
if you're old or injured.

138
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,920
It sucks, but that doesn't change the fact that a post-op trans person has artificially

139
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
created genitals.

140
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,400
That's just how it is.

141
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,000
Hey folks, today let's talk about Cyberpunk Japan in the 80s.

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,760
Have you ever wondered why Cyberpunk as a genre is so steeped with Japanese imagery

143
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
and references?

144
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,880
Well, it's not just flavour text, it's xenophobia.

145
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,140
That's right, I'm here to put politics in your video game.

146
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,140
Please don't.

147
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,960
For fuck's sake, your feminist dance therapy degree does not qualify you to put politics

148
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
in anything.

149
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,460
Asian culture appearing in the Cyberpunk genre isn't a representation of the yellow menace

150
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,460
or something.

151
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,200
It's depictions of a post-national globalism and cultural blending that technological advancement,

152
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,960
open borders, hyper capitalism, and the trivialization of travel would create.

153
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
It's just like the thing with trans people, isn't it?

154
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,520
You hide them, it's bigotry.

155
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,960
You show them, it's bigotry.

156
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,500
Same with Asians for these people, but only when it's politically convenient, of course.

157
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,480
The culture of merit that a lot of Asian countries have, and frankly the Jews too, make them

158
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,720
the forgotten people of colour when it comes to things like reparations or racism.

159
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,040
Asians exist when it's a political talking point for social justice, but when their very

160
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,600
existence in the West disproves white supremacy, they vanish into thin air.

161
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,720
But hey, Cybersloth, you probably shouldn't be using a Tengu mask.

162
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,320
You're not Japanese, and that's cultural appropriation.

163
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
That's digital Japface.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,120
Stay in your lane.

165
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,200
You're talking to a transgender transhumanist in Tokyo who has conducted over 100 body modifications

166
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,280
on herself, who does programming for a living between organizing for socialist and anarchist

167
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
groups.

168
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,800
Please, corn pone with mayo, tell me how I don't get the Cyberpunk genre.

169
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,560
I'm embarrassed that you're living in the same country that I'm in.

170
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,280
Pray that we don't cross paths because I have a milkshake ready.

171
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,920
It doesn't matter how progressive you are, it doesn't matter your rad left credentials.

172
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,800
Step out of line even just once, and you're a Nazi worthy of a milkshake.

173
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,060
And finally, let me read you this fucking thread, dudes, because it sums up everything.

174
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,720
This looks like the most shitty, bland, and regressive game I've seen in years.

175
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,260
Imagine thinking of a Cyberpunk future, and now you can come up with a scruffy white guy

176
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
with a gun.

177
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,460
This box art looks like it would make the kinds of shitty 2014 transphobic jokes CD

178
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,760
Project Red's marketing department is known for.

179
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,680
This box art thinks the age of consent is a form of slavery.

180
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,200
This box art thinks you can stop Nazis by proving their ideas are bad.

181
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,800
This box art thinks it's important we acknowledge that all lives matter.

182
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,800
This box art votes against a woman's right to choose but calls itself apolitical.

183
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,760
This box art has a Clockwork Orange poster on its wall.

184
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,200
This box art thinks that if fast food workers wanted to make more money they should have

185
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,640
gotten STEM degrees.

186
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,800
This box art thinks Tyler Durden was the hero but that breaking a Starbucks window in protest

187
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,840
is not acceptable.

188
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,120
This box art thinks it's not prejudice, just gender critical.

189
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,620
This box art thinks Elon Musk is rich because he worked hard.

190
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,660
This box art thinks you can consent while passed out drunk.

191
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,760
This box art thinks it's good that Black Lives Matter demonstrates but that they'd

192
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,720
make more headway if they didn't block traffic.

193
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,560
This box art thinks the real problem is unions.

194
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,640
This box art is for free speech for everyone except women on YouTube who have opinions

195
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,800
about video games.

196
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,400
This box art imports copies of Japanese swimsuit volleyball games with advanced jiggle physics,

197
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,040
and this box art thinks queer people are just too sexual in public.

198
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,400
This box art just doesn't understand why people don't like PewDiePie.

199
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,440
This box art thinks the reason wages are so low is because employers aren't allowed

200
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,760
giving people even lower wages.

201
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,120
This box art tells you it isn't racist but likes to share articles about how black people's

202
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:10,280
skull shapes mean they have a lot of money.

203
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,640
You know that you can customize your character in Cyberpunk, right?

204
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,360
This isn't Jedi Fallen Order.

205
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,040
Olivia Hill, were you also mad that it was Shepard and not FemShep on the cover of all

206
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,600
the Mass Effect games?

207
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,640
These people will never be satisfied.

208
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,460
There's even one idiot who's complaining that cis white people are happy about trans

209
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,040
representation in Cyberpunk.

210
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,500
You know, the same people that activists have been shrieking at to stop being oppressive,

211
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,760
to be good allies, to be more accepting, to do something.

212
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,880
And now you shit on them for doing exactly that.

213
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,640
I could honestly keep going with this for the entire video because there's legions

214
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,200
of cry-bullies throwing tantrums all around Cyberpunk right now, to the point that white

215
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,680
SJWs are now telling the black creator of the Cyberpunk franchise that he doesn't know

216
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,240
about oppression and that he's the one doing Cyberpunk incorrectly.

217
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
But at some point, we've got to move on.

218
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Ubisoft

219
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:17,120
The new Watch Dogs game takes place in a post-Brexit London, where Sadiq Khan's knife ban has

220
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,000
utterly failed to bring law and order.

221
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,040
The alt-right has come to power and expelled all non-whites from the police force, making

222
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,180
white people the only enemies in the game.

223
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,180
The proud British characters uprising against The Man are almost universally brown punk

224
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,140
kids looking to take back their city, and the entire population is willing to be recruited

225
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,660
in the fight against the state, and all you have to do is go and ask them.

226
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,580
Yeah, this is the most blatantly political game of E3, and I'd highly recommend you

227
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,460
go and watch the gameplay trailer because it tells you so much more than I ever could.

228
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,060
Just a few things of note, though.

229
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,780
The UK's anthem only comes on whenever an old white person shows up, like the retired

230
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,780
assassin.

231
00:12:52,780 --> 00:13:05,340
Is the implication that the only Brits still in London are the old people, and that your

232
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,860
average citizen is not British but rather a proud European like Sadiq?

233
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,700
Considering how diverse the UK's police force actually is IRL, it's a wonder how

234
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,200
exactly they found this many white people that actually play the role of police state

235
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
pig.

236
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,060
I guess Ubisoft doesn't want to show a brown man acting as an oppressor.

237
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,140
Look at these background signs, dude.

238
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:30,100
Hashtag secure London, deport illegal aliens, a pathway to citizenship for immigrants if

239
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,940
they choose to work for the cops.

240
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,060
Even in a fictional universe where SJWs get to craft their perfect vision of what it would

241
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,820
be like for their political enemies to take over, service still guarantees citizenship.

242
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,020
These ads don't even say things like, we'll deport all non-white people or something.

243
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,120
They just say non-citizens.

244
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,120
This is how you know these people think that having open borders is a good thing, or that

245
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,520
the very concept of citizenship is bigoted.

246
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,520
There's actually nothing objectionable in these ads at all, and God only knows the warped

247
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,280
lens that Ubisoft's devs view the world through if they think that immigration control

248
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,160
is a dystopian concept.

249
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,520
Here's what verified hack Patrick Klepek had to say about Watch Dogs Legion.

250
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,200
The recruit everyone for the resistance pitch is undercut by the notion that plenty of people

251
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,600
would enjoy and benefit from an authoritarian regime, and have no interest in fighting back.

252
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,560
Hopeful the game addresses that in some way.

253
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,440
Well the implication, since you didn't pick it up Patrick, is that the powers that be

254
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,800
in London are behaving so badly that the entire population, regardless of their differences,

255
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,560
is willing to rise up against the state.

256
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,120
You think that this would be a lefty's wet dream, because this game obviously depicts

257
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,080
a post-Brexit society, even as Ubisoft tries to publicly spin that the game is apolitical.

258
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,920
But Klepek's complaints about realism actually undermine his own position, although he's

259
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,480
too dense to put it together.

260
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,960
Yes, plenty of people benefit from an authoritarian regime, or more likely, are just apolitical,

261
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,720
or prefer the tyranny of stability to the chaos of upheaval, and therefore would not

262
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
want to participate in the revolution.

263
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,800
That's why Antifa views everyone not them as the fash, or communists view the uninvolved

264
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,080
as counter-revolutionary elements.

265
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,280
You can't be neutral on a moving train and all.

266
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,960
But it's also a possibility that the world Ubisoft has crafted is nothing like reality.

267
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,400
The UK surveillance state is not a right-wing creation, but rather something that all parts

268
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,400
of the political spectrum has contributed to, the radical left with an especially noteworthy

269
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
glee about it.

270
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,000
It's actually more likely that the future depicted in Watch Dogs Legion is a future

271
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,640
where the remainers won out against the Brexiteers, due to the massive social fracturing caused

272
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,640
by the non-integration of anti-British cultures into London, necessitating a heavy police

273
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,720
presence to maintain law and order.

274
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,160
Slapping a few alt-right slogans around the place, and posing like teenage rebels doesn't

275
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,780
change the fact that, insofar as Brexit is concerned, this is something that the left

276
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,200
are more likely to do than the right.

277
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Bethesda

278
00:15:45,200 --> 00:16:01,160
Ok, Bethesda Waifu is adorable.

279
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,240
We all know it.

280
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,600
She came out on stage, excited and nervous, and announced her game in as cute a way as

281
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:34,120
she could.

282
00:16:34,120 --> 00:17:01,140
She became an instant meme, and everyone began drawing fanart of her and her on-stage antics.

283
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,140
And she loved it!

284
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,260
She even tweeted montages with heartfelt thanks to all of her fans.

285
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,780
SJWs were mad, because they are mad as a matter of course.

286
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,060
Stop fetishizing Asian women because they're cute!

287
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,060
This is racism!

288
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,420
I mean, forget about the fact that Ikumi Nakamura designed Bayonetta, a woman with impossibly

289
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,940
long legs, whose clothes disintegrate as she pulls off increasingly more complex combos.

290
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,140
A character that has been an SJW bane for years.

291
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,780
Oh no no no, NOW they're on her side.

292
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,220
I noticed the blue checkmarks reposting this older article.

293
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,220
Stop calling Asian women adorable.

294
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,380
I'm at work, I want to talk about work.

295
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,380
Cute.

296
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,380
Adorable.

297
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,380
I wish I could adopt you.

298
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,380
Pixie.

299
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,980
These are the things said by feminists, writers, and people who take time out of their weekends

300
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,420
to attend a literary festival.

301
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,300
A lot of progressive people.

302
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,560
And would-be well-meaning people, many of whom, I imagine, would be dismayed to learn

303
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,740
anything they've done could be thought racist.

304
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,060
But that's what it is.

305
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,220
However well-intentioned, it's racism.

306
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,620
Fine with me, Miss Kwon.

307
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,460
You're ugly, annoying, and I don't want you to be anywhere near me.

308
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,460
Is that better?

309
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,620
God, imagine living like this.

310
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,340
Imagine turning literally everything into a race issue.

311
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,500
Eventually people are going to get bored of you and tell you to fuck off because you've

312
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,780
got nothing insightful to say about anything without wrapping it back around to the colour

313
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,780
of your skin.

314
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,140
Which is quite white, by the way.

315
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,180
Enjoy your privilege.

316
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,160
In the end, the work that Ikumi Nakamura has done is incredible stuff.

317
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,300
She's actually the empowered, talented, working woman that feminists want to see.

318
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,140
She's actually the game developer that Western SJWs wish they were.

319
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,420
And that's why they hate her.

320
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,820
Of course, for me personally, Bethesda's conference contained one other noteworthy

321
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
bit.

322
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,820
A new Commander Keen game!

323
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,860
Commander Keen was an old PC platformer series released on floppy disks.

324
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,820
That's the save icon for you zoomers.

325
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,540
And I grew up loving those games.

326
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,460
However, the new one is a mobile game, and it's nothing like the original, not even

327
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,460
the same genre.

328
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,820
Yep, just like Command & Conquer last year, another beloved franchise is being flushed

329
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,020
down the fucking drain.

330
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:12,900
It broke my heart, guys.

331
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,700
But this leads me into my next topic.

332
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,020
Fuck you gamers.

333
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,380
Video games have been getting quite bad for a while now.

334
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,760
The blatant mistreatment of old franchises like Commander Keen or Command & Conquer is

335
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,540
just one spoke on that wheel.

336
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,980
Sure, there's the Final Fantasy 7 remake, which looks phenomenal, but for every FF7

337
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,700
there's a poorly optimized kernel trigger Steam port.

338
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,420
For every Trials of Mana, there's a barely functional Secret of Mana remake.

339
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,680
Big name game companies seem to be floundering, with the exception of maybe Nintendo.

340
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,180
On the flip side of the coin, indie games are in a renaissance right now, sure, but

341
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,020
a lot of those are made by SJWs and have their shit politics shoehorned in.

342
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,440
It's the rare indie game that is both high quality and doesn't try to convert you to

343
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,060
fucking communism or something just for turning it on.

344
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,260
Along with the misuse of old beloved franchises and the cancer that is the indie scene, games

345
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,180
are also becoming hyper corporatized.

346
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,900
And this is due to SJW involvement even as they rant about being anti-capitalist.

347
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,540
For example, the Epic Games store is buying up every game in sight.

348
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,080
Even if it's very clearly at the expense of the company's workers like with Borderlands

349
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,820
3, or if it breaks the terms of service of Kickstarter like with Shenmue 3, it's easy

350
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,980
to pin that on capitalism and think you know what's going on, but man it's just not

351
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,980
that simple.

352
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,500
Unionization of tech is worth its own video, so I won't dive too deep into it here, but

353
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,420
consider this, a lot of these game companies are in the same vein as the Silicon Valley

354
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,420
tech giants.

355
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,300
They're run by hyper lefties, they've got progressive leaning HR departments, and they

356
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,860
use social justice logic.

357
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,540
Remember for example when Kickstarter employees wanted to unionize, and Kickstarter's higher

358
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,620
ups said, unions are intended to protect the vulnerable members of society, and we feel

359
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,820
the demographics of this union undermines this important function.

360
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,220
We're concerned with the misappropriation of unions for use by privileged workers.

361
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,720
And what was the progressive reply to having their own rhetoric spewed back at them by

362
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
a company?

363
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,680
Lord, your union is problematic and should check its privilege.

364
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,860
Shit like this is a key danger of letting megacorporations pretend to be progressive.

365
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,920
No you idiot, this is exactly the future you wanted.

366
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,700
Here's the Kickstarter staff page.

367
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,380
Of those employees who opted to provide pictures, they're almost all white, with a sizable

368
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,440
minority being Asian, and only a few of other races.

369
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,080
There's also a lot of men here too.

370
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,240
Kickstarter is right in saying that its workers are privileged and are misappropriating unions

371
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,580
meant for the oppressed, because they're all fucking white males.

372
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,160
Your ideology gave them the tools to do this.

373
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,540
This is exactly how a social justice oriented company would act in this situation.

374
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,060
I know Kickstarter is not a strictly games company even though it funds a lot of games,

375
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,960
but my point is, it's not an exclusive function of capitalism for power or capital or talent

376
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,340
or whatever to pool in the hands of the few.

377
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:47,320
That seems to be a kind of fundamental law of nature at this point, and it's not exclusively

378
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,140
the domain of right-wing politics to create corporations that have shit business practices.

379
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,600
Epic Games, the company buying up exclusives left and right, is funded by Tencent, a Chinese

380
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,660
state-run company, but pointing this out on Twitter is considered both racist and counter-revolutionary

381
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,660
by this crowd.

382
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,160
The same crowd that screams for Japanese anime games to be censored for their problematic

383
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,620
sexual content if they ever come out over here.

384
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,720
It's sort of like how Google refuses to work with the American government but will happily

385
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,920
work with the Chinese one.

386
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,280
It's a level of backwards insanity that I don't think we've ever seen before.

387
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,560
Testified by a mixture of socialist sympathy, white guilt, and a desire to rebel against

388
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,420
the power structure while not really caring about the consequences.

389
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,840
This rant isn't much about video games anymore, because the ramping up of this type of exploitation

390
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,840
in games is only a small part of a larger issue.

391
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,200
Epic Store's shit business practices is only one part of it.

392
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,760
Same with the trend toward virtual rentals and away from physical ownership, like the

393
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,720
Google Stadia or Xbox's monthly Netflix-style service for games.

394
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,920
They want to control what you do with the things you buy after you buy them.

395
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,040
I went into this in-depth in my piracy video, and don't get me started on data collection,

396
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,240
this is just a complete nightmare waiting to happen.

397
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,120
How long until some idiot mouth-breather collaborator journalist tells me it's immoral to play

398
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,600
my old Super Nintendo because all of my old games have been ported to modern platforms?

399
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,440
So I should just shut up and pay again to play the games I already own, except this

400
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,400
time I won't own them because it'll be entirely online.

401
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,000
And my online copy of the game can be taken away for any reason, ranging from punishing

402
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,080
me for my off-platform speech, to deleting games from the service due to a high-profile

403
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,280
scandal surrounding the title, to the service simply shutting down due to age or lack of

404
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
use.

405
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,940
And in participating, all of my data will be collected and sent overseas, and all the

406
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,440
money I spend on the service will go into the pockets of people directly working against

407
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
my own interest.

408
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,600
And if I just refuse them and turn on my SNES in protest, then I'm a bigot that needs

409
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,760
to be punched or milkshaked or something.

410
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,320
Video games suck right now, and I don't even care about representation, like Lesbians

411
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,400
and The Last of Us or whatever, who cares, tell the stories you want to tell.

412
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
As long as you're not being coerced, I'm fine with whatever.

413
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,960
But video games suck right now because today's companies don't have any respect for the

414
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,520
properties they manage.

415
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,940
Finding a quality, non-regressive, non-censored game is like finding a needle in a haystack.

416
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,000
And despite what progressives say about it, social justice ideology is completely compatible

417
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,840
with hypercorporatism, and is the current justification for the game industry's unending

418
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
greed.

419
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,360
The silver lining is that some developers still have a spine.

420
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,160
Like when the official Cyberpunk Twitter account made an assume your gender joke, or when Wolfenstein's

421
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,880
social media compared game journals to the Reich and Nazi propaganda.

422
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,080
Or like when the former president of Nintendo of America, the reginator himself, said that

423
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,360
his company is about making quality games, and that political statements are for others

424
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,360
to make.

425
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,640
Making political statements are for other people to do.

426
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,040
We want people to smile and have fun when they play our games.

427
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,160
Or like when EA donated millions to charity and Anita threw a public fit because her charity

428
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,260
didn't receive any money.

429
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,640
To me, E3 has always been a blast.

430
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,640
I love streaming it.

431
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
I love seeing the new games.

432
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,780
I love the memes and the culture.

433
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,940
But politically, E3 was a garbage fire, and has been for a while now.

434
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,460
Just like gaming as a whole.

435
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,460
Watch who you buy from, don't support these shitty people who think they can pull a fast

436
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,900
one on you, and don't be afraid to pirate liberally if the situation calls for it.

437
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,940
And I'm still pissed about Tifa's titties.

438
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,000
Alright my friends, that about does it for me today.

439
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,220
The new artwork for the video, me flying around a strange void on my chair, was drawn by Panty

440
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,220
Gremlin.

441
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,740
They're actually facing some financial difficulties right now, so I'm going to put a link to

442
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,900
their GoFundMe in the description of this video, because I do want to support those

443
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,900
who support my channel.

444
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,900
Thank you very much.

445
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,500
I love you.
