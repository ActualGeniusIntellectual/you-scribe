WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.160
Another E3 has come and gone, my friends.

00:19.160 --> 00:23.280
As always, I streamed all of the conferences live on my gaming channel, Game Boomers, and

00:23.280 --> 00:25.640
there's a link in the description if you'd like to see them for yourself.

00:25.640 --> 00:28.300
But all in all, it was a rather lackluster E3.

00:28.300 --> 00:32.720
Not too many interesting games, and not too many hilariously cringey moments.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.160
Seemed rather soulless, in fact.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.640
But there was certainly a lot of social justice influence in games this year.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.080
And let's take a peek at that, one company at a time.

00:40.080 --> 00:48.840
Electronic Arts.

00:48.840 --> 00:53.000
The only interesting game to come out of EA this year was Jedi Fallen Order, and even

00:53.000 --> 00:55.360
then I'm really stretching it calling it interesting.

00:55.360 --> 00:59.980
The combat plays generically, the stealth looks forced, the cutscenes are quite wooden.

00:59.980 --> 01:05.040
The entire game, at least the part that EA had to show, was a generic on-rails adventure

01:05.040 --> 01:09.840
that alternated between story cinematics and bland action set pieces that only served as

01:09.840 --> 01:11.800
a bridge to the next story cinematic.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.080
It doesn't even feel like Star Wars, not really.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.980
It feels like a generic third-person action game wearing a Star Wars robe.

01:17.980 --> 01:20.580
But to talk about Star Wars, we have to talk about Disney.

01:20.580 --> 01:24.240
When Episode VII came out, Disney declared that the entirety of the Star Wars Extended

01:24.240 --> 01:28.560
Canon was struck from the record, both before and after the original movies.

01:28.560 --> 01:33.600
So no Grand Admiral Thrawn, no Knights of the Old Republic, and worst of all, no Shadows

01:33.600 --> 01:34.600
of the Empire.

01:34.600 --> 01:39.840
In its place, we got the new Disney Canon, complete with Han Solo, Mireille Su, whatever

01:39.840 --> 01:45.440
the fuck this is, an inexplicably bad writing designed to subvert expectations but not actually

01:45.440 --> 01:47.080
make any narrative sense.

01:47.080 --> 01:50.280
Jedi Fallen Order is in the new Disney Canon of Star Wars.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.280
That's a big problem itself, but SJWs still aren't satisfied with it.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.920
Some fans upset Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order protagonist is a white guy.

01:58.920 --> 02:02.480
Fallen Order looks fun but do I really need another white male Jedi?

02:02.480 --> 02:05.960
Kinda disappointing that player character is a generic video game white guy.

02:05.960 --> 02:10.040
The Jedi Fallen Order trailer is enticing enough, I just have trouble getting excited

02:10.040 --> 02:11.920
about playing a broody white dude.

02:11.920 --> 02:16.920
Jedi Fallen Order, here, play as this nondescript white guy and only him, no customization.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.820
Uh, you're not a vampire princess, dude.

02:19.860 --> 02:24.340
In fact, you're all white males and we need to hear from you less so how about you just

02:24.340 --> 02:25.340
shut up.

02:25.340 --> 02:27.780
I wouldn't characterize SJWs as fans.

02:27.780 --> 02:31.940
They don't watch the movies, play the games, obsess over the lore, or join the fandom.

02:31.940 --> 02:36.620
They just police creators, forcing their political worldview into everything they can, and calling

02:36.620 --> 02:38.200
people bigots if they resist.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.620
They don't actually care about the communities that they shit up.

02:40.620 --> 02:45.300
They're happy to destroy a franchise as long as they're the ones who rule over its demise.

02:45.300 --> 02:49.240
That's why nobody went to see Ghostbusters 2016, or why the Boba Fett Star Wars movie

02:49.240 --> 02:52.080
was cancelled after Han Solo's box office failure.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.880
They're not fans, they're just agitators, and there's no money to be made in bowing

02:55.880 --> 02:56.880
to them.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.800
In fact, the far superior Star Wars-related announcement, this E3, was that Limited Run

03:00.800 --> 03:06.240
Games is releasing a compilation of old, remastered Star Wars games, including the old Nintendo

03:06.240 --> 03:11.360
game, Episode I Racer, and yes, thank you God, Shadows of the Empire on the N64.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.360
Fuck Disney, man.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.360
Microsoft.

03:13.360 --> 03:32.120
The Xbox conference was pretty cool.

03:32.120 --> 03:36.400
It seems as if the massive failure of the Xbox One has kind of humbled Microsoft a bit.

03:36.400 --> 03:40.740
Their next generation console, Project Scarlet, is on paper impressive, though let's see

03:40.740 --> 03:42.300
if they can actually pull it off.

03:42.300 --> 03:46.620
And then there's the immortal meme that is Keanu Reeves appearing in Cyberpunk 2077.

03:46.620 --> 03:50.660
You might remember Cyberpunk 2077 as one of the most anticipated games in years.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.420
I know I've got my pre-order ready.

03:52.420 --> 03:56.460
But you also might remember it as the topic of a Eurogamer interview from last year, where

03:56.460 --> 04:01.700
the gender ideologue masquerading as a legitimate journalist grilled the devs over at CD Projekt

04:01.700 --> 04:03.580
Red over trans ideology.

04:03.580 --> 04:06.660
If someone wanted to choose a character that was gender fluid, how would you portray that?

04:06.660 --> 04:10.460
You know, as an example in the character creation, you can do that by not calling the type of

04:10.460 --> 04:13.800
body you choose, man or woman, but just title it as body type.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.660
And then, from a male or female body type, you can, on this basis, choose how to make

04:17.660 --> 04:18.660
your character.

04:18.660 --> 04:21.520
Beyond the aesthetics, could you choose to have a different pronoun?

04:21.520 --> 04:22.740
Is that an option in the game?

04:22.740 --> 04:24.100
I honestly don't know yet.

04:24.100 --> 04:28.540
What I can say was that it was a part of Cyberpunk 2020, but how exactly will we do it in Cyberpunk

04:28.540 --> 04:29.540
2077?

04:29.540 --> 04:30.540
I don't know yet.

04:30.540 --> 04:32.000
But it is definitely a thing we're aware of.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.660
I know plenty of fans who would appreciate that, after all.

04:34.660 --> 04:37.980
You have a main character with a name that doesn't specify any gender.

04:37.980 --> 04:38.980
Well, exactly.

04:38.980 --> 04:42.980
That's why we chose that name, because V works for male, it works for female, and we

04:42.980 --> 04:44.140
thought it would be a good option.

04:44.140 --> 04:45.580
For gender fluid as well?

04:45.580 --> 04:46.580
Yeah.

04:46.580 --> 04:49.260
I can only imagine how awkward this sounded IRL.

04:49.260 --> 04:51.740
It already oozes cringe in text form.

04:51.740 --> 04:54.760
This sounds like the morality police coming around to ensure that you're doing everything

04:54.760 --> 04:56.360
according to progressive principles.

04:56.360 --> 05:00.540
Like those videos of Sharia watchdogs in ISIS controlled territories, stopping people on

05:00.540 --> 05:04.580
the street or going shop to shop, ensuring that everybody's thinking is properly checked

05:04.580 --> 05:05.580
and corrected.

05:05.580 --> 05:09.500
A large part of the Hizbah's role is also assuring that the shops and stalls throughout

05:09.500 --> 05:12.700
the city are trading fairly.

05:12.700 --> 05:16.780
The patrol go door to door inspecting products, practices, and pricing.

05:16.780 --> 05:20.900
Like oh, make sure it's for gender fluid as well, we'll come down on you for your sins

05:20.900 --> 05:21.900
if it's not.

05:21.900 --> 05:27.220
So when footage of Cyberpunk came out, SJWs flocked to this advertisement in the background,

05:27.220 --> 05:28.220
calling it transphobic.

05:28.220 --> 05:32.900
It's an ad for a drink with the slogan, mix it up, and mentioning 16 different available

05:32.900 --> 05:33.900
flavors.

05:34.220 --> 05:37.580
It looks like there's a bulge there, which is probably why they're calling it transphobic.

05:37.580 --> 05:40.500
The activists getting angry at this ad are missing the point.

05:40.500 --> 05:44.380
The artist who created it said that her intent was in fact to reflect the dystopian state

05:44.380 --> 05:47.980
of a world in the grip of omnipresent all-powerful corporations.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.220
It's shocking, over-the-top, and exploitative.

05:50.220 --> 05:51.460
And yes, that's the point.

05:51.460 --> 05:55.420
You guys do realize that Cyberpunk is a hyper-capitalist dystopian setting, right?

05:55.420 --> 05:58.500
The kind of thing your socialist brethren screech about non-stop?

05:58.500 --> 06:02.980
Do you think such a world would give two flying fucks about your theories of oppression and

06:02.980 --> 06:03.980
privilege?

06:03.980 --> 06:08.420
But even more basic than that, if there weren't trans people in the game, they'd still complain.

06:08.420 --> 06:12.220
And now that there's trans people, visible trans people, you can't get more visible

06:12.220 --> 06:13.580
than a dick girl, really.

06:13.580 --> 06:15.900
The trans visibility issue is solved.

06:15.900 --> 06:19.300
And now they're wanting that they're visible, or sorry, they're exploited now.

06:19.300 --> 06:20.620
Well, I've got news for you.

06:20.620 --> 06:24.140
In a visual medium, there's three ways to represent trans people.

06:24.140 --> 06:28.040
One, make them perfectly passing and never bring it up, in which case they may as well

06:28.040 --> 06:29.040
be cis.

06:29.040 --> 06:33.400
Two, make them varying levels of passing, which is frankly more realistic, but then

06:33.400 --> 06:37.960
you cry about exploitation because the audience can tell their trans at a glance due to physical

06:37.960 --> 06:38.960
features.

06:38.960 --> 06:43.880
Or three, make them perfectly passing and make their trans status a story point reinforced

06:43.880 --> 06:48.300
only by dialogue, which would make the issue shoehorned and massively drop the quality

06:48.300 --> 06:49.300
of writing.

06:49.300 --> 06:54.080
By the way, the reason most woke media sucks is because they always choose option three.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.640
Oh, and in case you didn't pick up that this was all just self-serving tripe, Anna

06:57.640 --> 07:00.840
Valens, one of the people spearheading the charge of drummed-up outrage against this

07:00.840 --> 07:06.080
ad, also took the opportunity to advance her own shit game, Blood Pact, an erotic game

07:06.080 --> 07:09.200
about two trans women and their very visible boners.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.880
How exploitative of you, Anna.

07:10.880 --> 07:15.800
Trans activists are also mad because if you use futuristic tech to achieve a sex change,

07:15.800 --> 07:17.640
you lose a part of your humanity stat.

07:17.640 --> 07:21.800
What they fail to realize is that all futuristic body mods come with a humanity drop.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.960
It's part of the balance and the theming of the game, that replacing parts of your

07:24.960 --> 07:27.240
body with technology comes with ups and downs.

07:27.240 --> 07:32.000
Look, I thought Cyberpunk looked cool too, but I really do not want this to be ignored,

07:32.000 --> 07:35.160
especially by trans people who may be affected by it.

07:35.160 --> 07:39.720
It's an unfortunate fact of reality that, even today, you have to get some kind of basic

07:39.720 --> 07:43.860
body mod in order to transition, just like how you might have to get a joint replaced

07:43.860 --> 07:45.320
if you're old or injured.

07:45.320 --> 07:49.920
It sucks, but that doesn't change the fact that a post-op trans person has artificially

07:49.920 --> 07:50.920
created genitals.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.400
That's just how it is.

07:52.400 --> 07:56.000
Hey folks, today let's talk about Cyberpunk Japan in the 80s.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.760
Have you ever wondered why Cyberpunk as a genre is so steeped with Japanese imagery

07:59.760 --> 08:00.760
and references?

08:00.760 --> 08:02.880
Well, it's not just flavour text, it's xenophobia.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.140
That's right, I'm here to put politics in your video game.

08:06.140 --> 08:07.140
Please don't.

08:07.140 --> 08:10.960
For fuck's sake, your feminist dance therapy degree does not qualify you to put politics

08:10.960 --> 08:11.960
in anything.

08:11.960 --> 08:15.460
Asian culture appearing in the Cyberpunk genre isn't a representation of the yellow menace

08:15.460 --> 08:16.460
or something.

08:16.460 --> 08:21.200
It's depictions of a post-national globalism and cultural blending that technological advancement,

08:21.200 --> 08:24.960
open borders, hyper capitalism, and the trivialization of travel would create.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.160
It's just like the thing with trans people, isn't it?

08:27.160 --> 08:28.520
You hide them, it's bigotry.

08:28.520 --> 08:29.960
You show them, it's bigotry.

08:29.960 --> 08:33.500
Same with Asians for these people, but only when it's politically convenient, of course.

08:33.500 --> 08:37.480
The culture of merit that a lot of Asian countries have, and frankly the Jews too, make them

08:37.480 --> 08:41.720
the forgotten people of colour when it comes to things like reparations or racism.

08:41.720 --> 08:45.040
Asians exist when it's a political talking point for social justice, but when their very

08:45.040 --> 08:49.600
existence in the West disproves white supremacy, they vanish into thin air.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.720
But hey, Cybersloth, you probably shouldn't be using a Tengu mask.

08:53.720 --> 08:56.320
You're not Japanese, and that's cultural appropriation.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.000
That's digital Japface.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.120
Stay in your lane.

09:00.120 --> 09:05.200
You're talking to a transgender transhumanist in Tokyo who has conducted over 100 body modifications

09:05.200 --> 09:09.280
on herself, who does programming for a living between organizing for socialist and anarchist

09:09.280 --> 09:10.280
groups.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.800
Please, corn pone with mayo, tell me how I don't get the Cyberpunk genre.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.560
I'm embarrassed that you're living in the same country that I'm in.

09:16.560 --> 09:19.280
Pray that we don't cross paths because I have a milkshake ready.

09:19.280 --> 09:22.920
It doesn't matter how progressive you are, it doesn't matter your rad left credentials.

09:22.920 --> 09:26.800
Step out of line even just once, and you're a Nazi worthy of a milkshake.

09:26.800 --> 09:31.060
And finally, let me read you this fucking thread, dudes, because it sums up everything.

09:31.060 --> 09:35.720
This looks like the most shitty, bland, and regressive game I've seen in years.

09:35.720 --> 09:39.260
Imagine thinking of a Cyberpunk future, and now you can come up with a scruffy white guy

09:39.260 --> 09:40.260
with a gun.

09:40.260 --> 09:44.460
This box art looks like it would make the kinds of shitty 2014 transphobic jokes CD

09:44.460 --> 09:46.760
Project Red's marketing department is known for.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.680
This box art thinks the age of consent is a form of slavery.

09:49.680 --> 09:53.200
This box art thinks you can stop Nazis by proving their ideas are bad.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.800
This box art thinks it's important we acknowledge that all lives matter.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.800
This box art votes against a woman's right to choose but calls itself apolitical.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.760
This box art has a Clockwork Orange poster on its wall.

10:03.760 --> 10:07.200
This box art thinks that if fast food workers wanted to make more money they should have

10:07.200 --> 10:08.640
gotten STEM degrees.

10:08.640 --> 10:12.800
This box art thinks Tyler Durden was the hero but that breaking a Starbucks window in protest

10:12.800 --> 10:13.840
is not acceptable.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.120
This box art thinks it's not prejudice, just gender critical.

10:17.120 --> 10:23.620
This box art thinks Elon Musk is rich because he worked hard.

10:23.620 --> 10:26.660
This box art thinks you can consent while passed out drunk.

10:26.660 --> 10:30.760
This box art thinks it's good that Black Lives Matter demonstrates but that they'd

10:30.760 --> 10:32.720
make more headway if they didn't block traffic.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.560
This box art thinks the real problem is unions.

10:35.560 --> 10:39.640
This box art is for free speech for everyone except women on YouTube who have opinions

10:39.640 --> 10:40.800
about video games.

10:40.800 --> 10:46.400
This box art imports copies of Japanese swimsuit volleyball games with advanced jiggle physics,

10:46.400 --> 10:49.040
and this box art thinks queer people are just too sexual in public.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.400
This box art just doesn't understand why people don't like PewDiePie.

10:52.400 --> 10:56.440
This box art thinks the reason wages are so low is because employers aren't allowed

10:56.440 --> 10:58.760
giving people even lower wages.

10:58.760 --> 11:03.120
This box art tells you it isn't racist but likes to share articles about how black people's

11:03.120 --> 11:10.280
skull shapes mean they have a lot of money.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.640
You know that you can customize your character in Cyberpunk, right?

11:13.640 --> 11:15.360
This isn't Jedi Fallen Order.

11:15.360 --> 11:20.040
Olivia Hill, were you also mad that it was Shepard and not FemShep on the cover of all

11:20.040 --> 11:21.600
the Mass Effect games?

11:21.600 --> 11:23.640
These people will never be satisfied.

11:23.640 --> 11:27.460
There's even one idiot who's complaining that cis white people are happy about trans

11:27.460 --> 11:29.040
representation in Cyberpunk.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.500
You know, the same people that activists have been shrieking at to stop being oppressive,

11:32.500 --> 11:35.760
to be good allies, to be more accepting, to do something.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.880
And now you shit on them for doing exactly that.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.640
I could honestly keep going with this for the entire video because there's legions

11:41.640 --> 11:46.200
of cry-bullies throwing tantrums all around Cyberpunk right now, to the point that white

11:46.200 --> 11:50.680
SJWs are now telling the black creator of the Cyberpunk franchise that he doesn't know

11:50.680 --> 11:54.240
about oppression and that he's the one doing Cyberpunk incorrectly.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.240
But at some point, we've got to move on.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.240
Ubisoft

11:57.240 --> 12:17.120
The new Watch Dogs game takes place in a post-Brexit London, where Sadiq Khan's knife ban has

12:17.120 --> 12:19.000
utterly failed to bring law and order.

12:19.000 --> 12:23.040
The alt-right has come to power and expelled all non-whites from the police force, making

12:23.040 --> 12:25.180
white people the only enemies in the game.

12:25.180 --> 12:30.180
The proud British characters uprising against The Man are almost universally brown punk

12:30.180 --> 12:34.140
kids looking to take back their city, and the entire population is willing to be recruited

12:34.140 --> 12:37.660
in the fight against the state, and all you have to do is go and ask them.

12:37.660 --> 12:41.580
Yeah, this is the most blatantly political game of E3, and I'd highly recommend you

12:41.580 --> 12:45.460
go and watch the gameplay trailer because it tells you so much more than I ever could.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.060
Just a few things of note, though.

12:47.060 --> 12:51.780
The UK's anthem only comes on whenever an old white person shows up, like the retired

12:51.780 --> 12:52.780
assassin.

12:52.780 --> 13:05.340
Is the implication that the only Brits still in London are the old people, and that your

13:05.340 --> 13:09.860
average citizen is not British but rather a proud European like Sadiq?

13:09.860 --> 13:13.700
Considering how diverse the UK's police force actually is IRL, it's a wonder how

13:13.700 --> 13:18.200
exactly they found this many white people that actually play the role of police state

13:18.200 --> 13:19.200
pig.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.060
I guess Ubisoft doesn't want to show a brown man acting as an oppressor.

13:22.340 --> 13:24.140
Look at these background signs, dude.

13:24.140 --> 13:30.100
Hashtag secure London, deport illegal aliens, a pathway to citizenship for immigrants if

13:30.100 --> 13:31.940
they choose to work for the cops.

13:31.940 --> 13:36.060
Even in a fictional universe where SJWs get to craft their perfect vision of what it would

13:36.060 --> 13:40.820
be like for their political enemies to take over, service still guarantees citizenship.

13:40.820 --> 13:45.020
These ads don't even say things like, we'll deport all non-white people or something.

13:45.020 --> 13:47.120
They just say non-citizens.

13:47.120 --> 13:51.120
This is how you know these people think that having open borders is a good thing, or that

13:51.200 --> 13:53.520
the very concept of citizenship is bigoted.

13:53.520 --> 13:57.520
There's actually nothing objectionable in these ads at all, and God only knows the warped

13:57.520 --> 14:02.280
lens that Ubisoft's devs view the world through if they think that immigration control

14:02.280 --> 14:04.160
is a dystopian concept.

14:04.160 --> 14:08.520
Here's what verified hack Patrick Klepek had to say about Watch Dogs Legion.

14:08.520 --> 14:13.200
The recruit everyone for the resistance pitch is undercut by the notion that plenty of people

14:13.200 --> 14:17.600
would enjoy and benefit from an authoritarian regime, and have no interest in fighting back.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.560
Hopeful the game addresses that in some way.

14:19.560 --> 14:23.440
Well the implication, since you didn't pick it up Patrick, is that the powers that be

14:23.440 --> 14:28.800
in London are behaving so badly that the entire population, regardless of their differences,

14:28.800 --> 14:30.560
is willing to rise up against the state.

14:30.560 --> 14:34.120
You think that this would be a lefty's wet dream, because this game obviously depicts

14:34.120 --> 14:39.080
a post-Brexit society, even as Ubisoft tries to publicly spin that the game is apolitical.

14:39.080 --> 14:42.920
But Klepek's complaints about realism actually undermine his own position, although he's

14:42.920 --> 14:44.480
too dense to put it together.

14:44.480 --> 14:49.960
Yes, plenty of people benefit from an authoritarian regime, or more likely, are just apolitical,

14:49.960 --> 14:53.720
or prefer the tyranny of stability to the chaos of upheaval, and therefore would not

14:53.720 --> 14:55.720
want to participate in the revolution.

14:55.720 --> 15:00.800
That's why Antifa views everyone not them as the fash, or communists view the uninvolved

15:00.800 --> 15:03.080
as counter-revolutionary elements.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.280
You can't be neutral on a moving train and all.

15:05.280 --> 15:09.960
But it's also a possibility that the world Ubisoft has crafted is nothing like reality.

15:09.960 --> 15:14.400
The UK surveillance state is not a right-wing creation, but rather something that all parts

15:14.400 --> 15:18.400
of the political spectrum has contributed to, the radical left with an especially noteworthy

15:18.400 --> 15:19.400
glee about it.

15:19.400 --> 15:23.000
It's actually more likely that the future depicted in Watch Dogs Legion is a future

15:23.000 --> 15:27.640
where the remainers won out against the Brexiteers, due to the massive social fracturing caused

15:27.640 --> 15:32.640
by the non-integration of anti-British cultures into London, necessitating a heavy police

15:32.640 --> 15:34.720
presence to maintain law and order.

15:34.720 --> 15:39.160
Slapping a few alt-right slogans around the place, and posing like teenage rebels doesn't

15:39.160 --> 15:42.780
change the fact that, insofar as Brexit is concerned, this is something that the left

15:42.780 --> 15:44.200
are more likely to do than the right.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.200
Bethesda

15:45.200 --> 16:01.160
Ok, Bethesda Waifu is adorable.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.240
We all know it.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.600
She came out on stage, excited and nervous, and announced her game in as cute a way as

16:05.600 --> 16:34.120
she could.

16:34.120 --> 17:01.140
She became an instant meme, and everyone began drawing fanart of her and her on-stage antics.

17:01.140 --> 17:02.140
And she loved it!

17:02.140 --> 17:05.260
She even tweeted montages with heartfelt thanks to all of her fans.

17:05.260 --> 17:08.780
SJWs were mad, because they are mad as a matter of course.

17:08.780 --> 17:11.060
Stop fetishizing Asian women because they're cute!

17:11.060 --> 17:12.060
This is racism!

17:12.060 --> 17:16.420
I mean, forget about the fact that Ikumi Nakamura designed Bayonetta, a woman with impossibly

17:16.420 --> 17:20.940
long legs, whose clothes disintegrate as she pulls off increasingly more complex combos.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.140
A character that has been an SJW bane for years.

17:23.140 --> 17:25.780
Oh no no no, NOW they're on her side.

17:25.780 --> 17:29.220
I noticed the blue checkmarks reposting this older article.

17:29.220 --> 17:31.220
Stop calling Asian women adorable.

17:31.220 --> 17:33.380
I'm at work, I want to talk about work.

17:33.380 --> 17:34.380
Cute.

17:34.380 --> 17:35.380
Adorable.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.380
I wish I could adopt you.

17:36.380 --> 17:37.380
Pixie.

17:37.380 --> 17:40.980
These are the things said by feminists, writers, and people who take time out of their weekends

17:40.980 --> 17:42.420
to attend a literary festival.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.300
A lot of progressive people.

17:44.300 --> 17:48.560
And would-be well-meaning people, many of whom, I imagine, would be dismayed to learn

17:48.560 --> 17:50.740
anything they've done could be thought racist.

17:50.740 --> 17:52.060
But that's what it is.

17:52.060 --> 17:54.220
However well-intentioned, it's racism.

17:54.220 --> 17:55.620
Fine with me, Miss Kwon.

17:55.620 --> 17:58.460
You're ugly, annoying, and I don't want you to be anywhere near me.

17:58.460 --> 17:59.460
Is that better?

17:59.500 --> 18:01.620
God, imagine living like this.

18:01.620 --> 18:04.340
Imagine turning literally everything into a race issue.

18:04.340 --> 18:06.500
Eventually people are going to get bored of you and tell you to fuck off because you've

18:06.500 --> 18:09.780
got nothing insightful to say about anything without wrapping it back around to the colour

18:09.780 --> 18:10.780
of your skin.

18:10.780 --> 18:12.140
Which is quite white, by the way.

18:12.140 --> 18:13.180
Enjoy your privilege.

18:13.180 --> 18:17.160
In the end, the work that Ikumi Nakamura has done is incredible stuff.

18:17.160 --> 18:21.300
She's actually the empowered, talented, working woman that feminists want to see.

18:21.300 --> 18:25.140
She's actually the game developer that Western SJWs wish they were.

18:25.140 --> 18:26.420
And that's why they hate her.

18:26.420 --> 18:30.820
Of course, for me personally, Bethesda's conference contained one other noteworthy

18:30.820 --> 18:31.820
bit.

18:31.820 --> 18:32.820
A new Commander Keen game!

18:32.820 --> 18:36.860
Commander Keen was an old PC platformer series released on floppy disks.

18:36.860 --> 18:38.820
That's the save icon for you zoomers.

18:38.820 --> 18:40.540
And I grew up loving those games.

18:40.540 --> 18:44.460
However, the new one is a mobile game, and it's nothing like the original, not even

18:44.460 --> 18:45.460
the same genre.

18:45.460 --> 18:49.820
Yep, just like Command & Conquer last year, another beloved franchise is being flushed

18:49.820 --> 18:51.020
down the fucking drain.

18:56.420 --> 19:12.900
It broke my heart, guys.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.700
But this leads me into my next topic.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.020
Fuck you gamers.

19:16.020 --> 19:18.380
Video games have been getting quite bad for a while now.

19:18.380 --> 19:22.760
The blatant mistreatment of old franchises like Commander Keen or Command & Conquer is

19:22.760 --> 19:24.540
just one spoke on that wheel.

19:24.540 --> 19:28.980
Sure, there's the Final Fantasy 7 remake, which looks phenomenal, but for every FF7

19:28.980 --> 19:31.700
there's a poorly optimized kernel trigger Steam port.

19:31.700 --> 19:35.420
For every Trials of Mana, there's a barely functional Secret of Mana remake.

19:35.420 --> 19:39.680
Big name game companies seem to be floundering, with the exception of maybe Nintendo.

19:39.680 --> 19:43.180
On the flip side of the coin, indie games are in a renaissance right now, sure, but

19:43.180 --> 19:47.020
a lot of those are made by SJWs and have their shit politics shoehorned in.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.440
It's the rare indie game that is both high quality and doesn't try to convert you to

19:50.440 --> 19:53.060
fucking communism or something just for turning it on.

19:53.060 --> 19:57.260
Along with the misuse of old beloved franchises and the cancer that is the indie scene, games

19:57.260 --> 19:59.180
are also becoming hyper corporatized.

19:59.180 --> 20:03.900
And this is due to SJW involvement even as they rant about being anti-capitalist.

20:03.900 --> 20:07.540
For example, the Epic Games store is buying up every game in sight.

20:07.540 --> 20:11.080
Even if it's very clearly at the expense of the company's workers like with Borderlands

20:11.080 --> 20:14.820
3, or if it breaks the terms of service of Kickstarter like with Shenmue 3, it's easy

20:14.820 --> 20:17.980
to pin that on capitalism and think you know what's going on, but man it's just not

20:17.980 --> 20:18.980
that simple.

20:18.980 --> 20:22.500
Unionization of tech is worth its own video, so I won't dive too deep into it here, but

20:22.500 --> 20:26.420
consider this, a lot of these game companies are in the same vein as the Silicon Valley

20:26.420 --> 20:27.420
tech giants.

20:27.420 --> 20:31.300
They're run by hyper lefties, they've got progressive leaning HR departments, and they

20:31.300 --> 20:32.860
use social justice logic.

20:32.860 --> 20:36.540
Remember for example when Kickstarter employees wanted to unionize, and Kickstarter's higher

20:36.540 --> 20:40.620
ups said, unions are intended to protect the vulnerable members of society, and we feel

20:40.620 --> 20:43.820
the demographics of this union undermines this important function.

20:43.820 --> 20:47.220
We're concerned with the misappropriation of unions for use by privileged workers.

20:47.220 --> 20:50.720
And what was the progressive reply to having their own rhetoric spewed back at them by

20:50.720 --> 20:51.720
a company?

20:51.940 --> 20:55.680
Lord, your union is problematic and should check its privilege.

20:55.680 --> 20:59.860
Shit like this is a key danger of letting megacorporations pretend to be progressive.

20:59.860 --> 21:02.920
No you idiot, this is exactly the future you wanted.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.700
Here's the Kickstarter staff page.

21:04.700 --> 21:09.380
Of those employees who opted to provide pictures, they're almost all white, with a sizable

21:09.380 --> 21:12.440
minority being Asian, and only a few of other races.

21:12.440 --> 21:15.080
There's also a lot of men here too.

21:15.080 --> 21:19.240
Kickstarter is right in saying that its workers are privileged and are misappropriating unions

21:19.240 --> 21:24.580
meant for the oppressed, because they're all fucking white males.

21:24.580 --> 21:27.160
Your ideology gave them the tools to do this.

21:27.160 --> 21:31.540
This is exactly how a social justice oriented company would act in this situation.

21:31.540 --> 21:35.060
I know Kickstarter is not a strictly games company even though it funds a lot of games,

21:35.060 --> 21:39.960
but my point is, it's not an exclusive function of capitalism for power or capital or talent

21:39.960 --> 21:42.340
or whatever to pool in the hands of the few.

21:42.340 --> 21:47.320
That seems to be a kind of fundamental law of nature at this point, and it's not exclusively

21:47.320 --> 21:52.140
the domain of right-wing politics to create corporations that have shit business practices.

21:52.140 --> 21:56.600
Epic Games, the company buying up exclusives left and right, is funded by Tencent, a Chinese

21:56.600 --> 22:01.660
state-run company, but pointing this out on Twitter is considered both racist and counter-revolutionary

22:01.660 --> 22:02.660
by this crowd.

22:02.660 --> 22:07.160
The same crowd that screams for Japanese anime games to be censored for their problematic

22:07.160 --> 22:09.620
sexual content if they ever come out over here.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.720
It's sort of like how Google refuses to work with the American government but will happily

22:12.720 --> 22:13.920
work with the Chinese one.

22:13.920 --> 22:17.280
It's a level of backwards insanity that I don't think we've ever seen before.

22:17.280 --> 22:21.560
Testified by a mixture of socialist sympathy, white guilt, and a desire to rebel against

22:21.560 --> 22:24.420
the power structure while not really caring about the consequences.

22:24.420 --> 22:28.840
This rant isn't much about video games anymore, because the ramping up of this type of exploitation

22:28.840 --> 22:31.840
in games is only a small part of a larger issue.

22:31.840 --> 22:35.200
Epic Store's shit business practices is only one part of it.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.760
Same with the trend toward virtual rentals and away from physical ownership, like the

22:38.760 --> 22:42.720
Google Stadia or Xbox's monthly Netflix-style service for games.

22:42.720 --> 22:45.920
They want to control what you do with the things you buy after you buy them.

22:45.920 --> 22:50.040
I went into this in-depth in my piracy video, and don't get me started on data collection,

22:50.040 --> 22:52.240
this is just a complete nightmare waiting to happen.

22:52.240 --> 22:57.120
How long until some idiot mouth-breather collaborator journalist tells me it's immoral to play

22:57.120 --> 23:01.600
my old Super Nintendo because all of my old games have been ported to modern platforms?

23:01.600 --> 23:05.440
So I should just shut up and pay again to play the games I already own, except this

23:05.440 --> 23:08.400
time I won't own them because it'll be entirely online.

23:08.400 --> 23:12.000
And my online copy of the game can be taken away for any reason, ranging from punishing

23:12.000 --> 23:16.080
me for my off-platform speech, to deleting games from the service due to a high-profile

23:16.080 --> 23:20.280
scandal surrounding the title, to the service simply shutting down due to age or lack of

23:20.280 --> 23:21.280
use.

23:21.280 --> 23:24.940
And in participating, all of my data will be collected and sent overseas, and all the

23:24.940 --> 23:28.440
money I spend on the service will go into the pockets of people directly working against

23:28.440 --> 23:29.440
my own interest.

23:29.440 --> 23:33.600
And if I just refuse them and turn on my SNES in protest, then I'm a bigot that needs

23:33.600 --> 23:35.760
to be punched or milkshaked or something.

23:35.760 --> 23:39.320
Video games suck right now, and I don't even care about representation, like Lesbians

23:39.320 --> 23:42.400
and The Last of Us or whatever, who cares, tell the stories you want to tell.

23:42.400 --> 23:44.640
As long as you're not being coerced, I'm fine with whatever.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.960
But video games suck right now because today's companies don't have any respect for the

23:47.960 --> 23:49.520
properties they manage.

23:49.520 --> 23:53.940
Finding a quality, non-regressive, non-censored game is like finding a needle in a haystack.

23:53.940 --> 23:58.000
And despite what progressives say about it, social justice ideology is completely compatible

23:58.000 --> 24:01.840
with hypercorporatism, and is the current justification for the game industry's unending

24:01.840 --> 24:02.840
greed.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.360
The silver lining is that some developers still have a spine.

24:05.360 --> 24:09.160
Like when the official Cyberpunk Twitter account made an assume your gender joke, or when Wolfenstein's

24:09.160 --> 24:12.880
social media compared game journals to the Reich and Nazi propaganda.

24:12.880 --> 24:16.080
Or like when the former president of Nintendo of America, the reginator himself, said that

24:16.080 --> 24:19.360
his company is about making quality games, and that political statements are for others

24:19.360 --> 24:20.360
to make.

24:20.360 --> 24:23.640
Making political statements are for other people to do.

24:23.640 --> 24:27.040
We want people to smile and have fun when they play our games.

24:27.040 --> 24:31.160
Or like when EA donated millions to charity and Anita threw a public fit because her charity

24:31.160 --> 24:32.260
didn't receive any money.

24:32.260 --> 24:34.640
To me, E3 has always been a blast.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.640
I love streaming it.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.640
I love seeing the new games.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.780
I love the memes and the culture.

24:38.780 --> 24:42.940
But politically, E3 was a garbage fire, and has been for a while now.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.460
Just like gaming as a whole.

24:44.460 --> 24:48.460
Watch who you buy from, don't support these shitty people who think they can pull a fast

24:48.460 --> 24:53.900
one on you, and don't be afraid to pirate liberally if the situation calls for it.

24:53.900 --> 24:56.940
And I'm still pissed about Tifa's titties.

24:56.940 --> 24:59.000
Alright my friends, that about does it for me today.

24:59.000 --> 25:04.220
The new artwork for the video, me flying around a strange void on my chair, was drawn by Panty

25:04.220 --> 25:05.220
Gremlin.

25:05.220 --> 25:08.740
They're actually facing some financial difficulties right now, so I'm going to put a link to

25:08.740 --> 25:12.900
their GoFundMe in the description of this video, because I do want to support those

25:12.900 --> 25:13.900
who support my channel.

25:13.900 --> 25:14.900
Thank you very much.

25:14.900 --> 25:15.500
I love you.
