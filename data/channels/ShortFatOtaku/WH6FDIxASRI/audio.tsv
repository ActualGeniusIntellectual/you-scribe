0	19160	Another E3 has come and gone, my friends.
19160	23280	As always, I streamed all of the conferences live on my gaming channel, Game Boomers, and
23280	25640	there's a link in the description if you'd like to see them for yourself.
25640	28300	But all in all, it was a rather lackluster E3.
28300	32720	Not too many interesting games, and not too many hilariously cringey moments.
32720	34160	Seemed rather soulless, in fact.
34160	37640	But there was certainly a lot of social justice influence in games this year.
37640	40080	And let's take a peek at that, one company at a time.
40080	48840	Electronic Arts.
48840	53000	The only interesting game to come out of EA this year was Jedi Fallen Order, and even
53000	55360	then I'm really stretching it calling it interesting.
55360	59980	The combat plays generically, the stealth looks forced, the cutscenes are quite wooden.
59980	65040	The entire game, at least the part that EA had to show, was a generic on-rails adventure
65040	69840	that alternated between story cinematics and bland action set pieces that only served as
69840	71800	a bridge to the next story cinematic.
71800	74080	It doesn't even feel like Star Wars, not really.
74080	77980	It feels like a generic third-person action game wearing a Star Wars robe.
77980	80580	But to talk about Star Wars, we have to talk about Disney.
80580	84240	When Episode VII came out, Disney declared that the entirety of the Star Wars Extended
84240	88560	Canon was struck from the record, both before and after the original movies.
88560	93600	So no Grand Admiral Thrawn, no Knights of the Old Republic, and worst of all, no Shadows
93600	94600	of the Empire.
94600	99840	In its place, we got the new Disney Canon, complete with Han Solo, Mireille Su, whatever
99840	105440	the fuck this is, an inexplicably bad writing designed to subvert expectations but not actually
105440	107080	make any narrative sense.
107080	110280	Jedi Fallen Order is in the new Disney Canon of Star Wars.
110320	114280	That's a big problem itself, but SJWs still aren't satisfied with it.
114280	118920	Some fans upset Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order protagonist is a white guy.
118920	122480	Fallen Order looks fun but do I really need another white male Jedi?
122480	125960	Kinda disappointing that player character is a generic video game white guy.
125960	130040	The Jedi Fallen Order trailer is enticing enough, I just have trouble getting excited
130040	131920	about playing a broody white dude.
131920	136920	Jedi Fallen Order, here, play as this nondescript white guy and only him, no customization.
136920	139820	Uh, you're not a vampire princess, dude.
139860	144340	In fact, you're all white males and we need to hear from you less so how about you just
144340	145340	shut up.
145340	147780	I wouldn't characterize SJWs as fans.
147780	151940	They don't watch the movies, play the games, obsess over the lore, or join the fandom.
151940	156620	They just police creators, forcing their political worldview into everything they can, and calling
156620	158200	people bigots if they resist.
158200	160620	They don't actually care about the communities that they shit up.
160620	165300	They're happy to destroy a franchise as long as they're the ones who rule over its demise.
165300	169240	That's why nobody went to see Ghostbusters 2016, or why the Boba Fett Star Wars movie
169240	172080	was cancelled after Han Solo's box office failure.
172080	175880	They're not fans, they're just agitators, and there's no money to be made in bowing
175880	176880	to them.
176880	180800	In fact, the far superior Star Wars-related announcement, this E3, was that Limited Run
180800	186240	Games is releasing a compilation of old, remastered Star Wars games, including the old Nintendo
186240	191360	game, Episode I Racer, and yes, thank you God, Shadows of the Empire on the N64.
191360	192360	Fuck Disney, man.
192360	193360	Microsoft.
193360	212120	The Xbox conference was pretty cool.
212120	216400	It seems as if the massive failure of the Xbox One has kind of humbled Microsoft a bit.
216400	220740	Their next generation console, Project Scarlet, is on paper impressive, though let's see
220740	222300	if they can actually pull it off.
222300	226620	And then there's the immortal meme that is Keanu Reeves appearing in Cyberpunk 2077.
226620	230660	You might remember Cyberpunk 2077 as one of the most anticipated games in years.
230660	232420	I know I've got my pre-order ready.
232420	236460	But you also might remember it as the topic of a Eurogamer interview from last year, where
236460	241700	the gender ideologue masquerading as a legitimate journalist grilled the devs over at CD Projekt
241700	243580	Red over trans ideology.
243580	246660	If someone wanted to choose a character that was gender fluid, how would you portray that?
246660	250460	You know, as an example in the character creation, you can do that by not calling the type of
250460	253800	body you choose, man or woman, but just title it as body type.
253800	257660	And then, from a male or female body type, you can, on this basis, choose how to make
257660	258660	your character.
258660	261520	Beyond the aesthetics, could you choose to have a different pronoun?
261520	262740	Is that an option in the game?
262740	264100	I honestly don't know yet.
264100	268540	What I can say was that it was a part of Cyberpunk 2020, but how exactly will we do it in Cyberpunk
268540	269540	2077?
269540	270540	I don't know yet.
270540	272000	But it is definitely a thing we're aware of.
272000	274660	I know plenty of fans who would appreciate that, after all.
274660	277980	You have a main character with a name that doesn't specify any gender.
277980	278980	Well, exactly.
278980	282980	That's why we chose that name, because V works for male, it works for female, and we
282980	284140	thought it would be a good option.
284140	285580	For gender fluid as well?
285580	286580	Yeah.
286580	289260	I can only imagine how awkward this sounded IRL.
289260	291740	It already oozes cringe in text form.
291740	294760	This sounds like the morality police coming around to ensure that you're doing everything
294760	296360	according to progressive principles.
296360	300540	Like those videos of Sharia watchdogs in ISIS controlled territories, stopping people on
300540	304580	the street or going shop to shop, ensuring that everybody's thinking is properly checked
304580	305580	and corrected.
305580	309500	A large part of the Hizbah's role is also assuring that the shops and stalls throughout
309500	312700	the city are trading fairly.
312700	316780	The patrol go door to door inspecting products, practices, and pricing.
316780	320900	Like oh, make sure it's for gender fluid as well, we'll come down on you for your sins
320900	321900	if it's not.
321900	327220	So when footage of Cyberpunk came out, SJWs flocked to this advertisement in the background,
327220	328220	calling it transphobic.
328220	332900	It's an ad for a drink with the slogan, mix it up, and mentioning 16 different available
332900	333900	flavors.
334220	337580	It looks like there's a bulge there, which is probably why they're calling it transphobic.
337580	340500	The activists getting angry at this ad are missing the point.
340500	344380	The artist who created it said that her intent was in fact to reflect the dystopian state
344380	347980	of a world in the grip of omnipresent all-powerful corporations.
347980	350220	It's shocking, over-the-top, and exploitative.
350220	351460	And yes, that's the point.
351460	355420	You guys do realize that Cyberpunk is a hyper-capitalist dystopian setting, right?
355420	358500	The kind of thing your socialist brethren screech about non-stop?
358500	362980	Do you think such a world would give two flying fucks about your theories of oppression and
362980	363980	privilege?
363980	368420	But even more basic than that, if there weren't trans people in the game, they'd still complain.
368420	372220	And now that there's trans people, visible trans people, you can't get more visible
372220	373580	than a dick girl, really.
373580	375900	The trans visibility issue is solved.
375900	379300	And now they're wanting that they're visible, or sorry, they're exploited now.
379300	380620	Well, I've got news for you.
380620	384140	In a visual medium, there's three ways to represent trans people.
384140	388040	One, make them perfectly passing and never bring it up, in which case they may as well
388040	389040	be cis.
389040	393400	Two, make them varying levels of passing, which is frankly more realistic, but then
393400	397960	you cry about exploitation because the audience can tell their trans at a glance due to physical
397960	398960	features.
398960	403880	Or three, make them perfectly passing and make their trans status a story point reinforced
403880	408300	only by dialogue, which would make the issue shoehorned and massively drop the quality
408300	409300	of writing.
409300	414080	By the way, the reason most woke media sucks is because they always choose option three.
414080	417640	Oh, and in case you didn't pick up that this was all just self-serving tripe, Anna
417640	420840	Valens, one of the people spearheading the charge of drummed-up outrage against this
420840	426080	ad, also took the opportunity to advance her own shit game, Blood Pact, an erotic game
426080	429200	about two trans women and their very visible boners.
429200	430880	How exploitative of you, Anna.
430880	435800	Trans activists are also mad because if you use futuristic tech to achieve a sex change,
435800	437640	you lose a part of your humanity stat.
437640	441800	What they fail to realize is that all futuristic body mods come with a humanity drop.
441800	444960	It's part of the balance and the theming of the game, that replacing parts of your
444960	447240	body with technology comes with ups and downs.
447240	452000	Look, I thought Cyberpunk looked cool too, but I really do not want this to be ignored,
452000	455160	especially by trans people who may be affected by it.
455160	459720	It's an unfortunate fact of reality that, even today, you have to get some kind of basic
459720	463860	body mod in order to transition, just like how you might have to get a joint replaced
463860	465320	if you're old or injured.
465320	469920	It sucks, but that doesn't change the fact that a post-op trans person has artificially
469920	470920	created genitals.
470920	472400	That's just how it is.
472400	476000	Hey folks, today let's talk about Cyberpunk Japan in the 80s.
476000	479760	Have you ever wondered why Cyberpunk as a genre is so steeped with Japanese imagery
479760	480760	and references?
480760	482880	Well, it's not just flavour text, it's xenophobia.
482880	486140	That's right, I'm here to put politics in your video game.
486140	487140	Please don't.
487140	490960	For fuck's sake, your feminist dance therapy degree does not qualify you to put politics
490960	491960	in anything.
491960	495460	Asian culture appearing in the Cyberpunk genre isn't a representation of the yellow menace
495460	496460	or something.
496460	501200	It's depictions of a post-national globalism and cultural blending that technological advancement,
501200	504960	open borders, hyper capitalism, and the trivialization of travel would create.
505160	507160	It's just like the thing with trans people, isn't it?
507160	508520	You hide them, it's bigotry.
508520	509960	You show them, it's bigotry.
509960	513500	Same with Asians for these people, but only when it's politically convenient, of course.
513500	517480	The culture of merit that a lot of Asian countries have, and frankly the Jews too, make them
517480	521720	the forgotten people of colour when it comes to things like reparations or racism.
521720	525040	Asians exist when it's a political talking point for social justice, but when their very
525040	529600	existence in the West disproves white supremacy, they vanish into thin air.
529600	533720	But hey, Cybersloth, you probably shouldn't be using a Tengu mask.
533720	536320	You're not Japanese, and that's cultural appropriation.
536320	538000	That's digital Japface.
538000	540120	Stay in your lane.
540120	545200	You're talking to a transgender transhumanist in Tokyo who has conducted over 100 body modifications
545200	549280	on herself, who does programming for a living between organizing for socialist and anarchist
549280	550280	groups.
550280	553800	Please, corn pone with mayo, tell me how I don't get the Cyberpunk genre.
553800	556560	I'm embarrassed that you're living in the same country that I'm in.
556560	559280	Pray that we don't cross paths because I have a milkshake ready.
559280	562920	It doesn't matter how progressive you are, it doesn't matter your rad left credentials.
562920	566800	Step out of line even just once, and you're a Nazi worthy of a milkshake.
566800	571060	And finally, let me read you this fucking thread, dudes, because it sums up everything.
571060	575720	This looks like the most shitty, bland, and regressive game I've seen in years.
575720	579260	Imagine thinking of a Cyberpunk future, and now you can come up with a scruffy white guy
579260	580260	with a gun.
580260	584460	This box art looks like it would make the kinds of shitty 2014 transphobic jokes CD
584460	586760	Project Red's marketing department is known for.
586760	589680	This box art thinks the age of consent is a form of slavery.
589680	593200	This box art thinks you can stop Nazis by proving their ideas are bad.
593200	596800	This box art thinks it's important we acknowledge that all lives matter.
596800	600800	This box art votes against a woman's right to choose but calls itself apolitical.
600800	603760	This box art has a Clockwork Orange poster on its wall.
603760	607200	This box art thinks that if fast food workers wanted to make more money they should have
607200	608640	gotten STEM degrees.
608640	612800	This box art thinks Tyler Durden was the hero but that breaking a Starbucks window in protest
612800	613840	is not acceptable.
613840	617120	This box art thinks it's not prejudice, just gender critical.
617120	623620	This box art thinks Elon Musk is rich because he worked hard.
623620	626660	This box art thinks you can consent while passed out drunk.
626660	630760	This box art thinks it's good that Black Lives Matter demonstrates but that they'd
630760	632720	make more headway if they didn't block traffic.
632720	635560	This box art thinks the real problem is unions.
635560	639640	This box art is for free speech for everyone except women on YouTube who have opinions
639640	640800	about video games.
640800	646400	This box art imports copies of Japanese swimsuit volleyball games with advanced jiggle physics,
646400	649040	and this box art thinks queer people are just too sexual in public.
649040	652400	This box art just doesn't understand why people don't like PewDiePie.
652400	656440	This box art thinks the reason wages are so low is because employers aren't allowed
656440	658760	giving people even lower wages.
658760	663120	This box art tells you it isn't racist but likes to share articles about how black people's
663120	670280	skull shapes mean they have a lot of money.
670280	673640	You know that you can customize your character in Cyberpunk, right?
673640	675360	This isn't Jedi Fallen Order.
675360	680040	Olivia Hill, were you also mad that it was Shepard and not FemShep on the cover of all
680040	681600	the Mass Effect games?
681600	683640	These people will never be satisfied.
683640	687460	There's even one idiot who's complaining that cis white people are happy about trans
687460	689040	representation in Cyberpunk.
689040	692500	You know, the same people that activists have been shrieking at to stop being oppressive,
692500	695760	to be good allies, to be more accepting, to do something.
695760	697880	And now you shit on them for doing exactly that.
697880	701640	I could honestly keep going with this for the entire video because there's legions
701640	706200	of cry-bullies throwing tantrums all around Cyberpunk right now, to the point that white
706200	710680	SJWs are now telling the black creator of the Cyberpunk franchise that he doesn't know
710680	714240	about oppression and that he's the one doing Cyberpunk incorrectly.
714240	716240	But at some point, we've got to move on.
716240	717240	Ubisoft
717240	737120	The new Watch Dogs game takes place in a post-Brexit London, where Sadiq Khan's knife ban has
737120	739000	utterly failed to bring law and order.
739000	743040	The alt-right has come to power and expelled all non-whites from the police force, making
743040	745180	white people the only enemies in the game.
745180	750180	The proud British characters uprising against The Man are almost universally brown punk
750180	754140	kids looking to take back their city, and the entire population is willing to be recruited
754140	757660	in the fight against the state, and all you have to do is go and ask them.
757660	761580	Yeah, this is the most blatantly political game of E3, and I'd highly recommend you
761580	765460	go and watch the gameplay trailer because it tells you so much more than I ever could.
765460	767060	Just a few things of note, though.
767060	771780	The UK's anthem only comes on whenever an old white person shows up, like the retired
771780	772780	assassin.
772780	785340	Is the implication that the only Brits still in London are the old people, and that your
785340	789860	average citizen is not British but rather a proud European like Sadiq?
789860	793700	Considering how diverse the UK's police force actually is IRL, it's a wonder how
793700	798200	exactly they found this many white people that actually play the role of police state
798200	799200	pig.
799200	802060	I guess Ubisoft doesn't want to show a brown man acting as an oppressor.
802340	804140	Look at these background signs, dude.
804140	810100	Hashtag secure London, deport illegal aliens, a pathway to citizenship for immigrants if
810100	811940	they choose to work for the cops.
811940	816060	Even in a fictional universe where SJWs get to craft their perfect vision of what it would
816060	820820	be like for their political enemies to take over, service still guarantees citizenship.
820820	825020	These ads don't even say things like, we'll deport all non-white people or something.
825020	827120	They just say non-citizens.
827120	831120	This is how you know these people think that having open borders is a good thing, or that
831200	833520	the very concept of citizenship is bigoted.
833520	837520	There's actually nothing objectionable in these ads at all, and God only knows the warped
837520	842280	lens that Ubisoft's devs view the world through if they think that immigration control
842280	844160	is a dystopian concept.
844160	848520	Here's what verified hack Patrick Klepek had to say about Watch Dogs Legion.
848520	853200	The recruit everyone for the resistance pitch is undercut by the notion that plenty of people
853200	857600	would enjoy and benefit from an authoritarian regime, and have no interest in fighting back.
857600	859560	Hopeful the game addresses that in some way.
859560	863440	Well the implication, since you didn't pick it up Patrick, is that the powers that be
863440	868800	in London are behaving so badly that the entire population, regardless of their differences,
868800	870560	is willing to rise up against the state.
870560	874120	You think that this would be a lefty's wet dream, because this game obviously depicts
874120	879080	a post-Brexit society, even as Ubisoft tries to publicly spin that the game is apolitical.
879080	882920	But Klepek's complaints about realism actually undermine his own position, although he's
882920	884480	too dense to put it together.
884480	889960	Yes, plenty of people benefit from an authoritarian regime, or more likely, are just apolitical,
889960	893720	or prefer the tyranny of stability to the chaos of upheaval, and therefore would not
893720	895720	want to participate in the revolution.
895720	900800	That's why Antifa views everyone not them as the fash, or communists view the uninvolved
900800	903080	as counter-revolutionary elements.
903080	905280	You can't be neutral on a moving train and all.
905280	909960	But it's also a possibility that the world Ubisoft has crafted is nothing like reality.
909960	914400	The UK surveillance state is not a right-wing creation, but rather something that all parts
914400	918400	of the political spectrum has contributed to, the radical left with an especially noteworthy
918400	919400	glee about it.
919400	923000	It's actually more likely that the future depicted in Watch Dogs Legion is a future
923000	927640	where the remainers won out against the Brexiteers, due to the massive social fracturing caused
927640	932640	by the non-integration of anti-British cultures into London, necessitating a heavy police
932640	934720	presence to maintain law and order.
934720	939160	Slapping a few alt-right slogans around the place, and posing like teenage rebels doesn't
939160	942780	change the fact that, insofar as Brexit is concerned, this is something that the left
942780	944200	are more likely to do than the right.
944200	945200	Bethesda
945200	961160	Ok, Bethesda Waifu is adorable.
961160	962240	We all know it.
962240	965600	She came out on stage, excited and nervous, and announced her game in as cute a way as
965600	994120	she could.
994120	1021140	She became an instant meme, and everyone began drawing fanart of her and her on-stage antics.
1021140	1022140	And she loved it!
1022140	1025260	She even tweeted montages with heartfelt thanks to all of her fans.
1025260	1028780	SJWs were mad, because they are mad as a matter of course.
1028780	1031060	Stop fetishizing Asian women because they're cute!
1031060	1032060	This is racism!
1032060	1036420	I mean, forget about the fact that Ikumi Nakamura designed Bayonetta, a woman with impossibly
1036420	1040940	long legs, whose clothes disintegrate as she pulls off increasingly more complex combos.
1040940	1043140	A character that has been an SJW bane for years.
1043140	1045780	Oh no no no, NOW they're on her side.
1045780	1049220	I noticed the blue checkmarks reposting this older article.
1049220	1051220	Stop calling Asian women adorable.
1051220	1053380	I'm at work, I want to talk about work.
1053380	1054380	Cute.
1054380	1055380	Adorable.
1055380	1056380	I wish I could adopt you.
1056380	1057380	Pixie.
1057380	1060980	These are the things said by feminists, writers, and people who take time out of their weekends
1060980	1062420	to attend a literary festival.
1062420	1064300	A lot of progressive people.
1064300	1068560	And would-be well-meaning people, many of whom, I imagine, would be dismayed to learn
1068560	1070740	anything they've done could be thought racist.
1070740	1072060	But that's what it is.
1072060	1074220	However well-intentioned, it's racism.
1074220	1075620	Fine with me, Miss Kwon.
1075620	1078460	You're ugly, annoying, and I don't want you to be anywhere near me.
1078460	1079460	Is that better?
1079500	1081620	God, imagine living like this.
1081620	1084340	Imagine turning literally everything into a race issue.
1084340	1086500	Eventually people are going to get bored of you and tell you to fuck off because you've
1086500	1089780	got nothing insightful to say about anything without wrapping it back around to the colour
1089780	1090780	of your skin.
1090780	1092140	Which is quite white, by the way.
1092140	1093180	Enjoy your privilege.
1093180	1097160	In the end, the work that Ikumi Nakamura has done is incredible stuff.
1097160	1101300	She's actually the empowered, talented, working woman that feminists want to see.
1101300	1105140	She's actually the game developer that Western SJWs wish they were.
1105140	1106420	And that's why they hate her.
1106420	1110820	Of course, for me personally, Bethesda's conference contained one other noteworthy
1110820	1111820	bit.
1111820	1112820	A new Commander Keen game!
1112820	1116860	Commander Keen was an old PC platformer series released on floppy disks.
1116860	1118820	That's the save icon for you zoomers.
1118820	1120540	And I grew up loving those games.
1120540	1124460	However, the new one is a mobile game, and it's nothing like the original, not even
1124460	1125460	the same genre.
1125460	1129820	Yep, just like Command & Conquer last year, another beloved franchise is being flushed
1129820	1131020	down the fucking drain.
1136420	1152900	It broke my heart, guys.
1152900	1154700	But this leads me into my next topic.
1154700	1156020	Fuck you gamers.
1156020	1158380	Video games have been getting quite bad for a while now.
1158380	1162760	The blatant mistreatment of old franchises like Commander Keen or Command & Conquer is
1162760	1164540	just one spoke on that wheel.
1164540	1168980	Sure, there's the Final Fantasy 7 remake, which looks phenomenal, but for every FF7
1168980	1171700	there's a poorly optimized kernel trigger Steam port.
1171700	1175420	For every Trials of Mana, there's a barely functional Secret of Mana remake.
1175420	1179680	Big name game companies seem to be floundering, with the exception of maybe Nintendo.
1179680	1183180	On the flip side of the coin, indie games are in a renaissance right now, sure, but
1183180	1187020	a lot of those are made by SJWs and have their shit politics shoehorned in.
1187020	1190440	It's the rare indie game that is both high quality and doesn't try to convert you to
1190440	1193060	fucking communism or something just for turning it on.
1193060	1197260	Along with the misuse of old beloved franchises and the cancer that is the indie scene, games
1197260	1199180	are also becoming hyper corporatized.
1199180	1203900	And this is due to SJW involvement even as they rant about being anti-capitalist.
1203900	1207540	For example, the Epic Games store is buying up every game in sight.
1207540	1211080	Even if it's very clearly at the expense of the company's workers like with Borderlands
1211080	1214820	3, or if it breaks the terms of service of Kickstarter like with Shenmue 3, it's easy
1214820	1217980	to pin that on capitalism and think you know what's going on, but man it's just not
1217980	1218980	that simple.
1218980	1222500	Unionization of tech is worth its own video, so I won't dive too deep into it here, but
1222500	1226420	consider this, a lot of these game companies are in the same vein as the Silicon Valley
1226420	1227420	tech giants.
1227420	1231300	They're run by hyper lefties, they've got progressive leaning HR departments, and they
1231300	1232860	use social justice logic.
1232860	1236540	Remember for example when Kickstarter employees wanted to unionize, and Kickstarter's higher
1236540	1240620	ups said, unions are intended to protect the vulnerable members of society, and we feel
1240620	1243820	the demographics of this union undermines this important function.
1243820	1247220	We're concerned with the misappropriation of unions for use by privileged workers.
1247220	1250720	And what was the progressive reply to having their own rhetoric spewed back at them by
1250720	1251720	a company?
1251940	1255680	Lord, your union is problematic and should check its privilege.
1255680	1259860	Shit like this is a key danger of letting megacorporations pretend to be progressive.
1259860	1262920	No you idiot, this is exactly the future you wanted.
1262920	1264700	Here's the Kickstarter staff page.
1264700	1269380	Of those employees who opted to provide pictures, they're almost all white, with a sizable
1269380	1272440	minority being Asian, and only a few of other races.
1272440	1275080	There's also a lot of men here too.
1275080	1279240	Kickstarter is right in saying that its workers are privileged and are misappropriating unions
1279240	1284580	meant for the oppressed, because they're all fucking white males.
1284580	1287160	Your ideology gave them the tools to do this.
1287160	1291540	This is exactly how a social justice oriented company would act in this situation.
1291540	1295060	I know Kickstarter is not a strictly games company even though it funds a lot of games,
1295060	1299960	but my point is, it's not an exclusive function of capitalism for power or capital or talent
1299960	1302340	or whatever to pool in the hands of the few.
1302340	1307320	That seems to be a kind of fundamental law of nature at this point, and it's not exclusively
1307320	1312140	the domain of right-wing politics to create corporations that have shit business practices.
1312140	1316600	Epic Games, the company buying up exclusives left and right, is funded by Tencent, a Chinese
1316600	1321660	state-run company, but pointing this out on Twitter is considered both racist and counter-revolutionary
1321660	1322660	by this crowd.
1322660	1327160	The same crowd that screams for Japanese anime games to be censored for their problematic
1327160	1329620	sexual content if they ever come out over here.
1329620	1332720	It's sort of like how Google refuses to work with the American government but will happily
1332720	1333920	work with the Chinese one.
1333920	1337280	It's a level of backwards insanity that I don't think we've ever seen before.
1337280	1341560	Testified by a mixture of socialist sympathy, white guilt, and a desire to rebel against
1341560	1344420	the power structure while not really caring about the consequences.
1344420	1348840	This rant isn't much about video games anymore, because the ramping up of this type of exploitation
1348840	1351840	in games is only a small part of a larger issue.
1351840	1355200	Epic Store's shit business practices is only one part of it.
1355200	1358760	Same with the trend toward virtual rentals and away from physical ownership, like the
1358760	1362720	Google Stadia or Xbox's monthly Netflix-style service for games.
1362720	1365920	They want to control what you do with the things you buy after you buy them.
1365920	1370040	I went into this in-depth in my piracy video, and don't get me started on data collection,
1370040	1372240	this is just a complete nightmare waiting to happen.
1372240	1377120	How long until some idiot mouth-breather collaborator journalist tells me it's immoral to play
1377120	1381600	my old Super Nintendo because all of my old games have been ported to modern platforms?
1381600	1385440	So I should just shut up and pay again to play the games I already own, except this
1385440	1388400	time I won't own them because it'll be entirely online.
1388400	1392000	And my online copy of the game can be taken away for any reason, ranging from punishing
1392000	1396080	me for my off-platform speech, to deleting games from the service due to a high-profile
1396080	1400280	scandal surrounding the title, to the service simply shutting down due to age or lack of
1400280	1401280	use.
1401280	1404940	And in participating, all of my data will be collected and sent overseas, and all the
1404940	1408440	money I spend on the service will go into the pockets of people directly working against
1408440	1409440	my own interest.
1409440	1413600	And if I just refuse them and turn on my SNES in protest, then I'm a bigot that needs
1413600	1415760	to be punched or milkshaked or something.
1415760	1419320	Video games suck right now, and I don't even care about representation, like Lesbians
1419320	1422400	and The Last of Us or whatever, who cares, tell the stories you want to tell.
1422400	1424640	As long as you're not being coerced, I'm fine with whatever.
1424640	1427960	But video games suck right now because today's companies don't have any respect for the
1427960	1429520	properties they manage.
1429520	1433940	Finding a quality, non-regressive, non-censored game is like finding a needle in a haystack.
1433940	1438000	And despite what progressives say about it, social justice ideology is completely compatible
1438000	1441840	with hypercorporatism, and is the current justification for the game industry's unending
1441840	1442840	greed.
1442840	1445360	The silver lining is that some developers still have a spine.
1445360	1449160	Like when the official Cyberpunk Twitter account made an assume your gender joke, or when Wolfenstein's
1449160	1452880	social media compared game journals to the Reich and Nazi propaganda.
1452880	1456080	Or like when the former president of Nintendo of America, the reginator himself, said that
1456080	1459360	his company is about making quality games, and that political statements are for others
1459360	1460360	to make.
1460360	1463640	Making political statements are for other people to do.
1463640	1467040	We want people to smile and have fun when they play our games.
1467040	1471160	Or like when EA donated millions to charity and Anita threw a public fit because her charity
1471160	1472260	didn't receive any money.
1472260	1474640	To me, E3 has always been a blast.
1474640	1475640	I love streaming it.
1475640	1476640	I love seeing the new games.
1476640	1478780	I love the memes and the culture.
1478780	1482940	But politically, E3 was a garbage fire, and has been for a while now.
1482940	1484460	Just like gaming as a whole.
1484460	1488460	Watch who you buy from, don't support these shitty people who think they can pull a fast
1488460	1493900	one on you, and don't be afraid to pirate liberally if the situation calls for it.
1493900	1496940	And I'm still pissed about Tifa's titties.
1496940	1499000	Alright my friends, that about does it for me today.
1499000	1504220	The new artwork for the video, me flying around a strange void on my chair, was drawn by Panty
1504220	1505220	Gremlin.
1505220	1508740	They're actually facing some financial difficulties right now, so I'm going to put a link to
1508740	1512900	their GoFundMe in the description of this video, because I do want to support those
1512900	1513900	who support my channel.
1513900	1514900	Thank you very much.
1514900	1515500	I love you.
