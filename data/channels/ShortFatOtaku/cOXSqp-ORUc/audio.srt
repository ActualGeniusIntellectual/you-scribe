1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,160
Trump's back, baby, and it's probably not going to go nearly as well as everyone thinks.

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,120
We all saw this coming, obviously. In that Piers Morgan interview a few weeks back, Trump

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,240
said it was illegal for him to comment, but that he had plans to announce something very

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:52,320
soon. But even before that, was there ever any doubt that Trump was going to run in 2024?

5
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,400
Seems obvious to me. There's one big issue, though, and that is DeSantis. Like him or

6
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,160
hate him, he's popular with the Republicans right now. Libertarian-oriented voters are

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,880
happy that he refused to implement long-term COVID-related policies like mask mandates,

8
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,440
lockdowns, or vaccine passes. Though they do tend to forget, he did implement an initial

9
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,480
lockdown in the summer of 2020, while the more religious conservative types are happy

10
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,200
about the Don't Say Gay bill that his government passed earlier this year. In 2016, Trump basically

11
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,200
bulldozed through the entire Republican establishment entirely on the force of his personality.

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,080
But it didn't hurt him that the Republican field was pretty boring aside from him. Was

13
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,940
anybody really excited about Rand Paul or Ted Cruz or heaven forbid Jeb Bush? Not really.

14
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,480
To contrast, DeSantis is relatively young, well-spoken, liked by the GOP establishment

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,840
— at least in comparison to Trump — popular among the core rightoid voter base, and unlike

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,000
all of Trump's 2016 opponents, he's charismatic enough that Trump can't just steamroll over

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,180
him like he did with Jeb. Trump isn't stupid, though. He recognizes DeSantis as his main

18
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,820
rival for the Republican nomination, which is why he's gone on the attack, nicknaming

19
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:10,300
him — in true Trumpian style — DeSanctimonious. And DeSantis fired back by doing nothing.

20
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,880
No, really. Here's an interview that DeSantis gave after the failure of the red wave to

21
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,620
materialize in the 2022 midterms. And it's long, so I won't play the whole thing for

22
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,300
you. But when reporters ask him about Trump entering the race and Trump's comments and

23
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:44,180
things like that, he just doesn't respond. He talks about how he won the Florida governorship

24
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,320
by the largest margins for a Republican in the history of the state, how the Republicans

25
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,540
now have a supermajority in the state's legislature, and how Florida has shown itself to be a model

26
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,420
for how to elect Republicans nationwide by appealing to the Independent Center. All of

27
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,940
which, by the way, are true statements.

28
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,600
Well, the one place I think that people can look to is the blueprint is Florida. Because

29
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,240
what have we done? I mean, you know, we came in at a very close election. In fact, before

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:14,140
I became governor, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, all the major races, governor, presidential,

31
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:21,380
were one point or less for that time. So in my race was less than a point in 2018. And

32
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:31,140
so we came in to a very, very large, diverse swing state. And we led. And we were on offense.

33
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,060
And we didn't shy away from big issues. We took on those issues. And we won victory after

34
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,740
victory for the people of Florida.

35
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,900
But the Trump comments? He had nothing to say. DeSantis just isn't engaging with Trump

36
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,980
baiting him. And it makes Trump look, to use one of his own terms, sad. Trump's out here

37
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,580
flailing around, and DeSantis just isn't falling for it. 2016 was a lesson on how,

38
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,120
if you engage with Trump's bluster, you pretty much automatically lose. Trump loves rolling

39
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,340
in the mud. He's a TV guy. He knows how to do it well. And DeSantis is making Trump look

40
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,900
worse, simply by ignoring him. Hell, maybe DeSantis even learned from the constant four-year

41
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,500
leftoid meltdown over Trump's presidency, where everybody from politicians to journalists

42
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,940
to pundits to YouTubers completely shredded their own credibility to take potshots at

43
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,760
Trump. And ironically enough, the person who didn't learn the lesson that Trump taught

44
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,520
seems to be Trump himself.

45
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,180
I'll talk about the Elon Twitter kerfuffle in a future video. Don't you worry. That

46
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,420
story is hyper on my radar for sure. But let's just go over one droplet from it today. Elon

47
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,020
unbanning Trump's Twitter account. The legendary at Real Donald Trump. The day it happened,

48
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,420
my Twitter timeline was full of retweeting the legendary old Trump tweets about fucked

49
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,340
up losers and garbage diet coke. All of it. It was glorious. What was also glorious was

50
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,620
the immense amount of salt unearthed by his return. Look at all of these blue checkmarks

51
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,420
running scared. A lot of them are decreeing they refuse to use Twitter if Trump returns.

52
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,440
And that really speaks to the mindset of these people. They've all stuck to Twitter because

53
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,980
it was basically the place that leftoids always de facto won. You could find leftists calling

54
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,460
for violence and whatever else. No problem. Their accounts remain unbanned. But if you're

55
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,260
not a leftist, you are shared to luck. And the crown jewel, the apex, was Trump getting

56
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,840
banned after January 6th. This was their playground. Only their narrative was allowed. And now

57
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,580
that Twitter isn't their playground, it's not even explicitly their opponent's playground.

58
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,280
Leftoids are still allowed to spout leftoid nonsense, as far as I can tell. They don't

59
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,180
want to play on it anymore. Except they still kind of do. Because Twitter is hyper addicting.

60
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,560
That's why the goalposts eventually shifted to if Trump tweets once, I'm out. All right,

61
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,040
dude. You always say you're done right after that one final hit. But as it turns out, Trump

62
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,540
actually hasn't tweeted once since getting unbanned. And apparently he's not going to.

63
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,920
When asked if he would, he said he didn't feel the need to because he now runs his own

64
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,560
social media platform, Truth Social. And sure, if you're a Trumpster, you might think

65
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,000
this is a gigachad move. But I don't. 2016 Trump would have come back to Twitter after

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,620
getting unbanned. 2022 Trump seems to be too proud to do so. There's been a fundamental

67
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,800
shift in his personality that I think makes DeSantis a better shot at winning the 2024

68
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,120
race. If you go back and listen to Trump's debates in 2016, he doesn't sound like a radical

69
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,560
at all. He sounds like a 90s era Democrat. Probably because he was a 90s era Democrat.

70
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,800
But as you examine his behavior during the course of his presidency, I think it slowly

71
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,200
became clear he did not know how to actually be the president of the United States. Now,

72
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,640
almost all the Trump derangement syndrome stuff that you heard back then was false.

73
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,760
Trump was never actually going to round up Latinos and the Muslims and put into the sword

74
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,100
or whatever. But really, what did Trump actually get done during his term? The first step act

75
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,080
was pretty good. Operation Warp Speed to kickstart the vaccine production seems to have worked

76
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,400
out. He built what, 25% of the wall? It's better than zero. The Supreme Court is a big

77
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,640
one. But any Republican president would have probably made the same picks that he did.

78
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,200
The actual accomplishments of the Trump administration are few and far between. He was overwhelmingly

79
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,360
a seat warmer. This means that he wasn't actually a crypto-fascist hidden and playing

80
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,120
the long game who orchestrated this masterful dismantling of American democratic institutions.

81
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,800
At best, you can say he gave a limp-wrist attempt at the very end while high in his

82
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,120
own copium. If he actually planned to steal the election from the get-go, he would have

83
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,080
done a lot more a lot earlier. But this also means he didn't actually do anything good

84
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,280
with his office either. And the reason he did almost nothing, positive or negative,

85
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,160
is because Trump doesn't actually know how to lead people. Trump sold himself as this

86
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,160
great negotiator, the art of the deal, guys. But over the course of his term, he became

87
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,600
the most obstinate president in recent memory, barely willing to cut deals with Democrats

88
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,840
at all. Trump's idea of a deal seems to be, I get everything I want, and in return, you

89
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,320
get nothing. And yeah, okay, giga chad. But that's not going to get anything done. And

90
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,680
that just doesn't seem to be the guy that Trump was in 2016. I don't know what changed.

91
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,800
Maybe the nature of actually having political power fucked him up. You know, take the throne

92
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,680
to act and the throne acts upon you. Maybe he actually was a Twitter addict like everyone

93
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,200
else's. Too terminally online to see the real world around him. A digital denithor.

94
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,400
Maybe he legitimately believed his own propaganda. That in his heart of hearts, he actually thinks

95
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,400
he won 2020. That everyone loves him. And it was entirely stolen from him by a corrupt

96
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,640
establishment. In fact, it's probably all three. In 2016, Trump embodied a heroic narrative.

97
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,600
You've got the American Uniparty aiming for a completely banal election between Hillary

98
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,880
and Jeb. Bernie, the outsider on the left, has already been cucked out of the race. Meanwhile,

99
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,000
Trump, with massive popular support among the common working man, is a wrecking ball

100
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,340
crashing through the Republican establishment, destroying political careers and dynasties

101
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,080
in the process, overcoming all odds and all common sense to capture the institution from

102
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,160
the inside. He's the rebellion winning against the empire. But what is the Trumpian heroic

103
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,560
narrative now? That he's a loser? That he was robbed two years ago and he won't stop

104
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,240
whining to anyone who will listen? You know, like, boo hoo, the game was rigged against

105
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,600
me. This isn't fair. Okay, let's accept for the argument, the game was actually rigged

106
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,640
against Trump. Heroes face unfair odds all the time. Part of the heroic narrative is

107
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,100
having the game stacked against you and still overcoming. Your enemy is corrupted, underhanded.

108
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,240
You are righteous and pure. You might take a few hits sticking to your principles, but

109
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,400
by golly, good wins in the end and you overcome. Now, real life isn't a story, obviously.

110
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,820
If Trump actually did have the election stolen from him, saying, haha, you didn't stick

111
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,620
to the heroic narrative and overcome the impossible odds, isn't really a criticism. But what

112
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,720
it does mean is that Trump's story for 2024 is no longer a heroic narrative, and the heroic

113
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,060
narrative is what attracted people to Trump in the first place. It is frankly the only

114
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,440
thing he had going for him in 2016. All that charisma that everyone loved, that was built

115
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,840
atop the heroic foundation, that he was this outsider taking on the establishment, speaking

116
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,780
in the voice of the common person, and now that's all gone. Which is why when Trump prowls

117
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,600
around the stage and calls DeSantis names, and DeSantis just ignores him, and continues

118
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,080
on diligently working, Trump looks desperate and pathetic. Maybe I'll be proven wrong,

119
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,220
who knows. It wouldn't be the first time I've had egg on my face, but I think the lifeblood

120
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,700
of the MAGA movement is spent. GOP Senate candidates in 2022 consistently outperformed

121
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,180
Trump in 2020. MAGA-aligned or Trump-endorsed candidates in the midterms either significantly

122
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,020
underperformed their expectations or outright lost, while more traditional GOP candidates

123
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,580
were more successful. The final death knell for the MAGA Republicans might even be Trump

124
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,060
himself. If DeSantis wins the Republican primaries fair and square, do you think Trump is humble

125
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,300
enough to stand aside? Hell no. He'll just run as independent, split the right-wing vote,

126
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,260
and give Biden, or whoever, another Democratic White House. And if Trump does win the GOP

127
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,020
primary, he will have to destroy the party's only true rising star in order to do it. In

128
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,660
other words, unless DeSantis just chooses not to run and waits six more years for a

129
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,380
shot at the big seat, Trump will have to destroy the future of right-wing politics in America

130
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,860
in order to even have a shot at redeeming himself. And as we all know, Trump is egotistical

131
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,940
enough to do it. Which probably means, for the foreseeable future, the American right

132
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,460
is fucked.
