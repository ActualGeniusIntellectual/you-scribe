0	20160	Trump's back, baby, and it's probably not going to go nearly as well as everyone thinks.
20160	24120	We all saw this coming, obviously. In that Piers Morgan interview a few weeks back, Trump
24120	28240	said it was illegal for him to comment, but that he had plans to announce something very
28240	52320	soon. But even before that, was there ever any doubt that Trump was going to run in 2024?
52320	56400	Seems obvious to me. There's one big issue, though, and that is DeSantis. Like him or
56400	60160	hate him, he's popular with the Republicans right now. Libertarian-oriented voters are
60160	64880	happy that he refused to implement long-term COVID-related policies like mask mandates,
64880	69440	lockdowns, or vaccine passes. Though they do tend to forget, he did implement an initial
69440	73480	lockdown in the summer of 2020, while the more religious conservative types are happy
73480	78200	about the Don't Say Gay bill that his government passed earlier this year. In 2016, Trump basically
78200	83200	bulldozed through the entire Republican establishment entirely on the force of his personality.
83200	87080	But it didn't hurt him that the Republican field was pretty boring aside from him. Was
87080	92940	anybody really excited about Rand Paul or Ted Cruz or heaven forbid Jeb Bush? Not really.
92940	97480	To contrast, DeSantis is relatively young, well-spoken, liked by the GOP establishment
97480	101840	— at least in comparison to Trump — popular among the core rightoid voter base, and unlike
101840	107000	all of Trump's 2016 opponents, he's charismatic enough that Trump can't just steamroll over
107000	111180	him like he did with Jeb. Trump isn't stupid, though. He recognizes DeSantis as his main
111180	114820	rival for the Republican nomination, which is why he's gone on the attack, nicknaming
114820	130300	him — in true Trumpian style — DeSanctimonious. And DeSantis fired back by doing nothing.
130300	133880	No, really. Here's an interview that DeSantis gave after the failure of the red wave to
133880	137620	materialize in the 2022 midterms. And it's long, so I won't play the whole thing for
137620	141300	you. But when reporters ask him about Trump entering the race and Trump's comments and
141300	164180	things like that, he just doesn't respond. He talks about how he won the Florida governorship
164180	167320	by the largest margins for a Republican in the history of the state, how the Republicans
167320	171540	now have a supermajority in the state's legislature, and how Florida has shown itself to be a model
171540	175420	for how to elect Republicans nationwide by appealing to the Independent Center. All of
175420	176940	which, by the way, are true statements.
176940	181600	Well, the one place I think that people can look to is the blueprint is Florida. Because
181600	186240	what have we done? I mean, you know, we came in at a very close election. In fact, before
186240	194140	I became governor, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, all the major races, governor, presidential,
194140	201380	were one point or less for that time. So in my race was less than a point in 2018. And
201380	211140	so we came in to a very, very large, diverse swing state. And we led. And we were on offense.
211140	217060	And we didn't shy away from big issues. We took on those issues. And we won victory after
217060	218740	victory for the people of Florida.
218740	222900	But the Trump comments? He had nothing to say. DeSantis just isn't engaging with Trump
222900	227980	baiting him. And it makes Trump look, to use one of his own terms, sad. Trump's out here
227980	232580	flailing around, and DeSantis just isn't falling for it. 2016 was a lesson on how,
232580	237120	if you engage with Trump's bluster, you pretty much automatically lose. Trump loves rolling
237120	241340	in the mud. He's a TV guy. He knows how to do it well. And DeSantis is making Trump look
241340	245900	worse, simply by ignoring him. Hell, maybe DeSantis even learned from the constant four-year
245900	250500	leftoid meltdown over Trump's presidency, where everybody from politicians to journalists
250500	254940	to pundits to YouTubers completely shredded their own credibility to take potshots at
254940	258760	Trump. And ironically enough, the person who didn't learn the lesson that Trump taught
258760	260520	seems to be Trump himself.
260520	264180	I'll talk about the Elon Twitter kerfuffle in a future video. Don't you worry. That
264180	269420	story is hyper on my radar for sure. But let's just go over one droplet from it today. Elon
269420	274020	unbanning Trump's Twitter account. The legendary at Real Donald Trump. The day it happened,
274020	278420	my Twitter timeline was full of retweeting the legendary old Trump tweets about fucked
278420	283340	up losers and garbage diet coke. All of it. It was glorious. What was also glorious was
283340	287620	the immense amount of salt unearthed by his return. Look at all of these blue checkmarks
287620	292420	running scared. A lot of them are decreeing they refuse to use Twitter if Trump returns.
292420	295440	And that really speaks to the mindset of these people. They've all stuck to Twitter because
295440	299980	it was basically the place that leftoids always de facto won. You could find leftists calling
299980	303460	for violence and whatever else. No problem. Their accounts remain unbanned. But if you're
303460	307260	not a leftist, you are shared to luck. And the crown jewel, the apex, was Trump getting
307260	311840	banned after January 6th. This was their playground. Only their narrative was allowed. And now
311840	315580	that Twitter isn't their playground, it's not even explicitly their opponent's playground.
315580	318280	Leftoids are still allowed to spout leftoid nonsense, as far as I can tell. They don't
318280	322180	want to play on it anymore. Except they still kind of do. Because Twitter is hyper addicting.
322180	326560	That's why the goalposts eventually shifted to if Trump tweets once, I'm out. All right,
326560	331040	dude. You always say you're done right after that one final hit. But as it turns out, Trump
331040	335540	actually hasn't tweeted once since getting unbanned. And apparently he's not going to.
335540	338920	When asked if he would, he said he didn't feel the need to because he now runs his own
338920	342560	social media platform, Truth Social. And sure, if you're a Trumpster, you might think
342560	347000	this is a gigachad move. But I don't. 2016 Trump would have come back to Twitter after
347000	351620	getting unbanned. 2022 Trump seems to be too proud to do so. There's been a fundamental
351620	356800	shift in his personality that I think makes DeSantis a better shot at winning the 2024
356800	361120	race. If you go back and listen to Trump's debates in 2016, he doesn't sound like a radical
361120	365560	at all. He sounds like a 90s era Democrat. Probably because he was a 90s era Democrat.
365560	369800	But as you examine his behavior during the course of his presidency, I think it slowly
369800	375200	became clear he did not know how to actually be the president of the United States. Now,
375200	378640	almost all the Trump derangement syndrome stuff that you heard back then was false.
378640	381760	Trump was never actually going to round up Latinos and the Muslims and put into the sword
381760	387100	or whatever. But really, what did Trump actually get done during his term? The first step act
387100	391080	was pretty good. Operation Warp Speed to kickstart the vaccine production seems to have worked
391080	395400	out. He built what, 25% of the wall? It's better than zero. The Supreme Court is a big
395400	399640	one. But any Republican president would have probably made the same picks that he did.
399640	405200	The actual accomplishments of the Trump administration are few and far between. He was overwhelmingly
405200	409360	a seat warmer. This means that he wasn't actually a crypto-fascist hidden and playing
409360	414120	the long game who orchestrated this masterful dismantling of American democratic institutions.
414120	417800	At best, you can say he gave a limp-wrist attempt at the very end while high in his
417800	421120	own copium. If he actually planned to steal the election from the get-go, he would have
421120	425080	done a lot more a lot earlier. But this also means he didn't actually do anything good
425080	429280	with his office either. And the reason he did almost nothing, positive or negative,
429280	433160	is because Trump doesn't actually know how to lead people. Trump sold himself as this
433160	437160	great negotiator, the art of the deal, guys. But over the course of his term, he became
437160	441600	the most obstinate president in recent memory, barely willing to cut deals with Democrats
441600	446840	at all. Trump's idea of a deal seems to be, I get everything I want, and in return, you
446840	451320	get nothing. And yeah, okay, giga chad. But that's not going to get anything done. And
451320	455680	that just doesn't seem to be the guy that Trump was in 2016. I don't know what changed.
455680	459800	Maybe the nature of actually having political power fucked him up. You know, take the throne
459800	463680	to act and the throne acts upon you. Maybe he actually was a Twitter addict like everyone
463680	468200	else's. Too terminally online to see the real world around him. A digital denithor.
468200	472400	Maybe he legitimately believed his own propaganda. That in his heart of hearts, he actually thinks
472400	476400	he won 2020. That everyone loves him. And it was entirely stolen from him by a corrupt
476400	481640	establishment. In fact, it's probably all three. In 2016, Trump embodied a heroic narrative.
481640	485600	You've got the American Uniparty aiming for a completely banal election between Hillary
485600	489880	and Jeb. Bernie, the outsider on the left, has already been cucked out of the race. Meanwhile,
489880	494000	Trump, with massive popular support among the common working man, is a wrecking ball
494000	498340	crashing through the Republican establishment, destroying political careers and dynasties
498340	503080	in the process, overcoming all odds and all common sense to capture the institution from
503080	507160	the inside. He's the rebellion winning against the empire. But what is the Trumpian heroic
507160	511560	narrative now? That he's a loser? That he was robbed two years ago and he won't stop
511560	515240	whining to anyone who will listen? You know, like, boo hoo, the game was rigged against
515240	518600	me. This isn't fair. Okay, let's accept for the argument, the game was actually rigged
518600	522640	against Trump. Heroes face unfair odds all the time. Part of the heroic narrative is
522640	527100	having the game stacked against you and still overcoming. Your enemy is corrupted, underhanded.
527100	530240	You are righteous and pure. You might take a few hits sticking to your principles, but
530240	535400	by golly, good wins in the end and you overcome. Now, real life isn't a story, obviously.
535400	539820	If Trump actually did have the election stolen from him, saying, haha, you didn't stick
539820	544620	to the heroic narrative and overcome the impossible odds, isn't really a criticism. But what
544620	550720	it does mean is that Trump's story for 2024 is no longer a heroic narrative, and the heroic
550720	555060	narrative is what attracted people to Trump in the first place. It is frankly the only
555060	559440	thing he had going for him in 2016. All that charisma that everyone loved, that was built
559440	563840	atop the heroic foundation, that he was this outsider taking on the establishment, speaking
563840	567780	in the voice of the common person, and now that's all gone. Which is why when Trump prowls
567780	572600	around the stage and calls DeSantis names, and DeSantis just ignores him, and continues
572600	577080	on diligently working, Trump looks desperate and pathetic. Maybe I'll be proven wrong,
577080	581220	who knows. It wouldn't be the first time I've had egg on my face, but I think the lifeblood
581220	586700	of the MAGA movement is spent. GOP Senate candidates in 2022 consistently outperformed
586700	592180	Trump in 2020. MAGA-aligned or Trump-endorsed candidates in the midterms either significantly
592180	597020	underperformed their expectations or outright lost, while more traditional GOP candidates
597020	601580	were more successful. The final death knell for the MAGA Republicans might even be Trump
601580	606060	himself. If DeSantis wins the Republican primaries fair and square, do you think Trump is humble
606060	610300	enough to stand aside? Hell no. He'll just run as independent, split the right-wing vote,
610300	615260	and give Biden, or whoever, another Democratic White House. And if Trump does win the GOP
615260	620020	primary, he will have to destroy the party's only true rising star in order to do it. In
620020	624660	other words, unless DeSantis just chooses not to run and waits six more years for a
624660	629380	shot at the big seat, Trump will have to destroy the future of right-wing politics in America
629380	633860	in order to even have a shot at redeeming himself. And as we all know, Trump is egotistical
633860	637940	enough to do it. Which probably means, for the foreseeable future, the American right
637940	638460	is fucked.
