WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.160
Trump's back, baby, and it's probably not going to go nearly as well as everyone thinks.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.120
We all saw this coming, obviously. In that Piers Morgan interview a few weeks back, Trump

00:24.120 --> 00:28.240
said it was illegal for him to comment, but that he had plans to announce something very

00:28.240 --> 00:52.320
soon. But even before that, was there ever any doubt that Trump was going to run in 2024?

00:52.320 --> 00:56.400
Seems obvious to me. There's one big issue, though, and that is DeSantis. Like him or

00:56.400 --> 01:00.160
hate him, he's popular with the Republicans right now. Libertarian-oriented voters are

01:00.160 --> 01:04.880
happy that he refused to implement long-term COVID-related policies like mask mandates,

01:04.880 --> 01:09.440
lockdowns, or vaccine passes. Though they do tend to forget, he did implement an initial

01:09.440 --> 01:13.480
lockdown in the summer of 2020, while the more religious conservative types are happy

01:13.480 --> 01:18.200
about the Don't Say Gay bill that his government passed earlier this year. In 2016, Trump basically

01:18.200 --> 01:23.200
bulldozed through the entire Republican establishment entirely on the force of his personality.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.080
But it didn't hurt him that the Republican field was pretty boring aside from him. Was

01:27.080 --> 01:32.940
anybody really excited about Rand Paul or Ted Cruz or heaven forbid Jeb Bush? Not really.

01:32.940 --> 01:37.480
To contrast, DeSantis is relatively young, well-spoken, liked by the GOP establishment

01:37.480 --> 01:41.840
— at least in comparison to Trump — popular among the core rightoid voter base, and unlike

01:41.840 --> 01:47.000
all of Trump's 2016 opponents, he's charismatic enough that Trump can't just steamroll over

01:47.000 --> 01:51.180
him like he did with Jeb. Trump isn't stupid, though. He recognizes DeSantis as his main

01:51.180 --> 01:54.820
rival for the Republican nomination, which is why he's gone on the attack, nicknaming

01:54.820 --> 02:10.300
him — in true Trumpian style — DeSanctimonious. And DeSantis fired back by doing nothing.

02:10.300 --> 02:13.880
No, really. Here's an interview that DeSantis gave after the failure of the red wave to

02:13.880 --> 02:17.620
materialize in the 2022 midterms. And it's long, so I won't play the whole thing for

02:17.620 --> 02:21.300
you. But when reporters ask him about Trump entering the race and Trump's comments and

02:21.300 --> 02:44.180
things like that, he just doesn't respond. He talks about how he won the Florida governorship

02:44.180 --> 02:47.320
by the largest margins for a Republican in the history of the state, how the Republicans

02:47.320 --> 02:51.540
now have a supermajority in the state's legislature, and how Florida has shown itself to be a model

02:51.540 --> 02:55.420
for how to elect Republicans nationwide by appealing to the Independent Center. All of

02:55.420 --> 02:56.940
which, by the way, are true statements.

02:56.940 --> 03:01.600
Well, the one place I think that people can look to is the blueprint is Florida. Because

03:01.600 --> 03:06.240
what have we done? I mean, you know, we came in at a very close election. In fact, before

03:06.240 --> 03:14.140
I became governor, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, all the major races, governor, presidential,

03:14.140 --> 03:21.380
were one point or less for that time. So in my race was less than a point in 2018. And

03:21.380 --> 03:31.140
so we came in to a very, very large, diverse swing state. And we led. And we were on offense.

03:31.140 --> 03:37.060
And we didn't shy away from big issues. We took on those issues. And we won victory after

03:37.060 --> 03:38.740
victory for the people of Florida.

03:38.740 --> 03:42.900
But the Trump comments? He had nothing to say. DeSantis just isn't engaging with Trump

03:42.900 --> 03:47.980
baiting him. And it makes Trump look, to use one of his own terms, sad. Trump's out here

03:47.980 --> 03:52.580
flailing around, and DeSantis just isn't falling for it. 2016 was a lesson on how,

03:52.580 --> 03:57.120
if you engage with Trump's bluster, you pretty much automatically lose. Trump loves rolling

03:57.120 --> 04:01.340
in the mud. He's a TV guy. He knows how to do it well. And DeSantis is making Trump look

04:01.340 --> 04:05.900
worse, simply by ignoring him. Hell, maybe DeSantis even learned from the constant four-year

04:05.900 --> 04:10.500
leftoid meltdown over Trump's presidency, where everybody from politicians to journalists

04:10.500 --> 04:14.940
to pundits to YouTubers completely shredded their own credibility to take potshots at

04:14.940 --> 04:18.760
Trump. And ironically enough, the person who didn't learn the lesson that Trump taught

04:18.760 --> 04:20.520
seems to be Trump himself.

04:20.520 --> 04:24.180
I'll talk about the Elon Twitter kerfuffle in a future video. Don't you worry. That

04:24.180 --> 04:29.420
story is hyper on my radar for sure. But let's just go over one droplet from it today. Elon

04:29.420 --> 04:34.020
unbanning Trump's Twitter account. The legendary at Real Donald Trump. The day it happened,

04:34.020 --> 04:38.420
my Twitter timeline was full of retweeting the legendary old Trump tweets about fucked

04:38.420 --> 04:43.340
up losers and garbage diet coke. All of it. It was glorious. What was also glorious was

04:43.340 --> 04:47.620
the immense amount of salt unearthed by his return. Look at all of these blue checkmarks

04:47.620 --> 04:52.420
running scared. A lot of them are decreeing they refuse to use Twitter if Trump returns.

04:52.420 --> 04:55.440
And that really speaks to the mindset of these people. They've all stuck to Twitter because

04:55.440 --> 04:59.980
it was basically the place that leftoids always de facto won. You could find leftists calling

04:59.980 --> 05:03.460
for violence and whatever else. No problem. Their accounts remain unbanned. But if you're

05:03.460 --> 05:07.260
not a leftist, you are shared to luck. And the crown jewel, the apex, was Trump getting

05:07.260 --> 05:11.840
banned after January 6th. This was their playground. Only their narrative was allowed. And now

05:11.840 --> 05:15.580
that Twitter isn't their playground, it's not even explicitly their opponent's playground.

05:15.580 --> 05:18.280
Leftoids are still allowed to spout leftoid nonsense, as far as I can tell. They don't

05:18.280 --> 05:22.180
want to play on it anymore. Except they still kind of do. Because Twitter is hyper addicting.

05:22.180 --> 05:26.560
That's why the goalposts eventually shifted to if Trump tweets once, I'm out. All right,

05:26.560 --> 05:31.040
dude. You always say you're done right after that one final hit. But as it turns out, Trump

05:31.040 --> 05:35.540
actually hasn't tweeted once since getting unbanned. And apparently he's not going to.

05:35.540 --> 05:38.920
When asked if he would, he said he didn't feel the need to because he now runs his own

05:38.920 --> 05:42.560
social media platform, Truth Social. And sure, if you're a Trumpster, you might think

05:42.560 --> 05:47.000
this is a gigachad move. But I don't. 2016 Trump would have come back to Twitter after

05:47.000 --> 05:51.620
getting unbanned. 2022 Trump seems to be too proud to do so. There's been a fundamental

05:51.620 --> 05:56.800
shift in his personality that I think makes DeSantis a better shot at winning the 2024

05:56.800 --> 06:01.120
race. If you go back and listen to Trump's debates in 2016, he doesn't sound like a radical

06:01.120 --> 06:05.560
at all. He sounds like a 90s era Democrat. Probably because he was a 90s era Democrat.

06:05.560 --> 06:09.800
But as you examine his behavior during the course of his presidency, I think it slowly

06:09.800 --> 06:15.200
became clear he did not know how to actually be the president of the United States. Now,

06:15.200 --> 06:18.640
almost all the Trump derangement syndrome stuff that you heard back then was false.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.760
Trump was never actually going to round up Latinos and the Muslims and put into the sword

06:21.760 --> 06:27.100
or whatever. But really, what did Trump actually get done during his term? The first step act

06:27.100 --> 06:31.080
was pretty good. Operation Warp Speed to kickstart the vaccine production seems to have worked

06:31.080 --> 06:35.400
out. He built what, 25% of the wall? It's better than zero. The Supreme Court is a big

06:35.400 --> 06:39.640
one. But any Republican president would have probably made the same picks that he did.

06:39.640 --> 06:45.200
The actual accomplishments of the Trump administration are few and far between. He was overwhelmingly

06:45.200 --> 06:49.360
a seat warmer. This means that he wasn't actually a crypto-fascist hidden and playing

06:49.360 --> 06:54.120
the long game who orchestrated this masterful dismantling of American democratic institutions.

06:54.120 --> 06:57.800
At best, you can say he gave a limp-wrist attempt at the very end while high in his

06:57.800 --> 07:01.120
own copium. If he actually planned to steal the election from the get-go, he would have

07:01.120 --> 07:05.080
done a lot more a lot earlier. But this also means he didn't actually do anything good

07:05.080 --> 07:09.280
with his office either. And the reason he did almost nothing, positive or negative,

07:09.280 --> 07:13.160
is because Trump doesn't actually know how to lead people. Trump sold himself as this

07:13.160 --> 07:17.160
great negotiator, the art of the deal, guys. But over the course of his term, he became

07:17.160 --> 07:21.600
the most obstinate president in recent memory, barely willing to cut deals with Democrats

07:21.600 --> 07:26.840
at all. Trump's idea of a deal seems to be, I get everything I want, and in return, you

07:26.840 --> 07:31.320
get nothing. And yeah, okay, giga chad. But that's not going to get anything done. And

07:31.320 --> 07:35.680
that just doesn't seem to be the guy that Trump was in 2016. I don't know what changed.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.800
Maybe the nature of actually having political power fucked him up. You know, take the throne

07:39.800 --> 07:43.680
to act and the throne acts upon you. Maybe he actually was a Twitter addict like everyone

07:43.680 --> 07:48.200
else's. Too terminally online to see the real world around him. A digital denithor.

07:48.200 --> 07:52.400
Maybe he legitimately believed his own propaganda. That in his heart of hearts, he actually thinks

07:52.400 --> 07:56.400
he won 2020. That everyone loves him. And it was entirely stolen from him by a corrupt

07:56.400 --> 08:01.640
establishment. In fact, it's probably all three. In 2016, Trump embodied a heroic narrative.

08:01.640 --> 08:05.600
You've got the American Uniparty aiming for a completely banal election between Hillary

08:05.600 --> 08:09.880
and Jeb. Bernie, the outsider on the left, has already been cucked out of the race. Meanwhile,

08:09.880 --> 08:14.000
Trump, with massive popular support among the common working man, is a wrecking ball

08:14.000 --> 08:18.340
crashing through the Republican establishment, destroying political careers and dynasties

08:18.340 --> 08:23.080
in the process, overcoming all odds and all common sense to capture the institution from

08:23.080 --> 08:27.160
the inside. He's the rebellion winning against the empire. But what is the Trumpian heroic

08:27.160 --> 08:31.560
narrative now? That he's a loser? That he was robbed two years ago and he won't stop

08:31.560 --> 08:35.240
whining to anyone who will listen? You know, like, boo hoo, the game was rigged against

08:35.240 --> 08:38.600
me. This isn't fair. Okay, let's accept for the argument, the game was actually rigged

08:38.600 --> 08:42.640
against Trump. Heroes face unfair odds all the time. Part of the heroic narrative is

08:42.640 --> 08:47.100
having the game stacked against you and still overcoming. Your enemy is corrupted, underhanded.

08:47.100 --> 08:50.240
You are righteous and pure. You might take a few hits sticking to your principles, but

08:50.240 --> 08:55.400
by golly, good wins in the end and you overcome. Now, real life isn't a story, obviously.

08:55.400 --> 08:59.820
If Trump actually did have the election stolen from him, saying, haha, you didn't stick

08:59.820 --> 09:04.620
to the heroic narrative and overcome the impossible odds, isn't really a criticism. But what

09:04.620 --> 09:10.720
it does mean is that Trump's story for 2024 is no longer a heroic narrative, and the heroic

09:10.720 --> 09:15.060
narrative is what attracted people to Trump in the first place. It is frankly the only

09:15.060 --> 09:19.440
thing he had going for him in 2016. All that charisma that everyone loved, that was built

09:19.440 --> 09:23.840
atop the heroic foundation, that he was this outsider taking on the establishment, speaking

09:23.840 --> 09:27.780
in the voice of the common person, and now that's all gone. Which is why when Trump prowls

09:27.780 --> 09:32.600
around the stage and calls DeSantis names, and DeSantis just ignores him, and continues

09:32.600 --> 09:37.080
on diligently working, Trump looks desperate and pathetic. Maybe I'll be proven wrong,

09:37.080 --> 09:41.220
who knows. It wouldn't be the first time I've had egg on my face, but I think the lifeblood

09:41.220 --> 09:46.700
of the MAGA movement is spent. GOP Senate candidates in 2022 consistently outperformed

09:46.700 --> 09:52.180
Trump in 2020. MAGA-aligned or Trump-endorsed candidates in the midterms either significantly

09:52.180 --> 09:57.020
underperformed their expectations or outright lost, while more traditional GOP candidates

09:57.020 --> 10:01.580
were more successful. The final death knell for the MAGA Republicans might even be Trump

10:01.580 --> 10:06.060
himself. If DeSantis wins the Republican primaries fair and square, do you think Trump is humble

10:06.060 --> 10:10.300
enough to stand aside? Hell no. He'll just run as independent, split the right-wing vote,

10:10.300 --> 10:15.260
and give Biden, or whoever, another Democratic White House. And if Trump does win the GOP

10:15.260 --> 10:20.020
primary, he will have to destroy the party's only true rising star in order to do it. In

10:20.020 --> 10:24.660
other words, unless DeSantis just chooses not to run and waits six more years for a

10:24.660 --> 10:29.380
shot at the big seat, Trump will have to destroy the future of right-wing politics in America

10:29.380 --> 10:33.860
in order to even have a shot at redeeming himself. And as we all know, Trump is egotistical

10:33.860 --> 10:37.940
enough to do it. Which probably means, for the foreseeable future, the American right

10:37.940 --> 10:38.460
is fucked.
