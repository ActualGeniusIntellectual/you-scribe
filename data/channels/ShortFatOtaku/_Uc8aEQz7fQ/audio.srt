1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
US President Donald Trump gave his first State of the Union address on January 30th, 2018.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,200
It was, in my opinion, an average speech.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,840
Probably the highlight of it all was the story of Based Crutchman, who managed to escape

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,580
from North Korea after losing a leg in an accident, an event that Donald Trump used

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,800
to emphasize the brutality of the North Korean regime.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,480
That's not to say that there weren't a few low points either.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,040
Nancy Pelosi spent the entire night looking like she was playing with her dentures.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,200
The Democratic side of the room booed when Trump motioned to the two sets of parents

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,040
of kids killed due to illegal immigrant gang violence that were in attendance.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,600
And the Black Caucus looked like somebody shat in their dinner when it was announced

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,320
that, statistically, poor black people were economically doing better than ever.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:53,480
I guess it's going to be hard to convince them to vote for you solely on the basis of

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,600
race, if they're not stuck in perpetual grinding poverty, eh guys?

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,740
But everybody expected the Nunes memo to drop during the State of the Union.

15
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,080
The timing was right, and it would have been a great way to decisively win that conversation

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
once and for all.

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,440
Personally, I'm glad that Trump didn't do it, though.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,560
I don't know about you guys, but I'm fine with the State of the Union being a little

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,800
less partisan than normal political affairs.

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:22,080
Nonetheless, during Trump's walk out of the room, the memo did come up.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
And there you have it.

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Trump's agreed to release the memo.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,520
And it's about at this point in the timeline of events that Democratic propaganda went

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
into overdrive.

25
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,160
But it was all for naught, because on February 2nd, 2018, the Nunes memo was finally released.

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,560
Let's give it a read.

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,120
Oh, and if you've already read it, timestamp on the screen is where you want to skip ahead

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,120
to.

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,040
This memorandum provides members an update on significant facts relating to the committee's

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,920
ongoing investigation into the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,200
and their use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act during the 2016 presidential

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,220
election cycle.

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,720
Our findings, which are detailed below, raise concerns with the legitimacy and legality

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,700
of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and

35
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,480
represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,300
from abuses related to the FISA process.

37
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:12,660
On October 21st, 2016, DOJ and FBI sought and received a FISA probable cause order,

38
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,700
not under Title VII, authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page from the FISC.

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,700
Page is a US citizen who served as a volunteer advisor to the Trump presidential campaign.

40
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,540
Consistent with requirements under FISA, the application had to be first certified

41
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,860
by the director or deputy director of the FBI.

42
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,420
It then required the approval of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, or the Senate-confirmed

43
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,900
Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division.

44
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,140
The FBI and DOJ obtained one initial FISA warrant targeting Carter Page and three FISA

45
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,380
renewals from the FISC.

46
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,780
As required by statute, a FISA order on an American citizen must be renewed by the FISC

47
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,440
every 90 days and each renewal requires a separate finding of probable cause.

48
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,120
Then Director James Comey signed three FISA applications in question on behalf of the

49
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,720
FBI and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one.

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:06,000
Then DAG Sally Yates, then acting DAG Dana Boente, and DAG Rod Rosenstein each signed

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,920
one or more FISA applications on behalf of the DOJ.

52
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,120
Due to the sensitive nature of foreign intelligence activity, FISA submissions, including renewals

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,320
before the FISC, are classified.

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,320
As such, the public's confidence in the integrity of the FISA process depends on the

55
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,360
court's ability to hold the government to the highest standard, particularly as it

56
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
relates to the surveillance of American citizens.

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,080
However, the FISC's rigor in protecting the rights of Americans, which is reinforced

58
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,000
by 90-day renewals of surveillance orders, is necessarily dependent on the government's

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,840
production to the court of all material and relevant facts.

60
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,520
This should include information potentially favorable to the target of the FISC application

61
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,580
that is known by the government.

62
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,640
In the case of Carter Page, the government had at least four independent opportunities

63
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,040
before the FISC to accurately provide an accounting of the relevant facts.

64
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,720
However, our findings indicate that, as described below, material and relevant information was

65
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
omitted.

66
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,480
The dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, the Steele dossier, on behalf of the Democratic

67
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,400
National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, formed an essential part of the

68
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,320
Carter Page FISA application.

69
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,460
Steele was a longtime FBI source who was paid over $160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign

70
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:13,040
via the law firm Perkins Coie and research firm Fusion GPS to obtain derogatory information

71
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,920
on Donald Trump's ties to Russia.

72
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,480
Neither the initial application in October 2016 nor any of the renewals disclose or reference

73
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,600
the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party or campaign in funding Steele's

74
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,580
efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior

75
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,400
DOJ and FBI officials.

76
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,080
The initial FISA application notes Steele was working for a named U.S. person, but does

77
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,000
not name Fusion GPS and principal Glenn Simpson, who was paid by a U.S. law firm, Perkins Coie,

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,720
representing the DNC, even though it was known by the DOJ at the time that political

79
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,920
actors were involved with the Steele dossier.

80
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,760
The application does not mention Steele was ultimately working on behalf of and paid by

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,800
the DNC and Clinton campaign, or that the FBI had separately authorized payment to Steele

82
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,960
for the same information.

83
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,440
The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016 Yahoo News

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,920
article by Michael Iscoff, which focuses on Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow.

85
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,100
This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information

86
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,240
leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News.

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,780
The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide the information

88
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,980
to Yahoo News.

89
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,220
Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News and several other

90
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,480
outlets in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS.

91
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,100
Perkins Coie was aware of Steele's initial media contacts because they hosted at least

92
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,500
one meeting in Washington D.C. in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was

93
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
discussed.

94
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,020
Steele was suspended and then terminated as an FBI source for what the FBI defines

95
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,940
as the most serious of violations, an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his relationship

96
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,260
with the FBI in an October 30, 2016 Mother Jones article by David Corn.

97
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,260
Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contacts with Yahoo and

98
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,940
other outlets in September before the Page application was submitted to the FISC in October,

99
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,620
but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about those contacts.

100
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,620
Steele's numerous encounters with the media violated the cardinal rule of source handling,

101
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,060
maintaining confidentiality, and demonstrated that Steele had become a less than reliable

102
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,660
source for the FBI.

103
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,100
Before and after Steele was terminated as a source, he maintained contact with DOJ via

104
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,000
then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, a senior DOJ official who worked closely

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,540
with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein.

106
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,060
Shortly after the election, the FBI began interviewing Ohr, documenting his communications

107
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,060
with Steele.

108
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,340
For example, in September 2016, Steele admitted to Ohr his feelings against then-candidate

109
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,620
Trump when Steele said that he was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was

110
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,660
passionate about him not being President.

111
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,160
This clear evidence of Steele's bias was recorded by Ohr at the time, and subsequently

112
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,100
in official FBI files, but not reflected in any of the Page visa applications.

113
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,880
During this same period, Ohr's wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation

114
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,600
of opposition research on Trump.

115
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,140
Ohr later provided the FBI with all of his wife's opposition research, paid for by

116
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,460
the DNC and Clinton campaign, via Fusion GPS.

117
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,340
The Ohr's relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably concealed from the FISC.

118
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,140
According to the head of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division, Assistant Director Bill Priestap,

119
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,300
corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its infancy at the time of the initial Page

120
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,700
visa application.

121
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,300
After Steele was terminated, a source validation report conducted by an independent unit within

122
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,340
FBI assessed Steele's reporting as only minimally corroborated.

123
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,420
Yet in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary

124
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,840
of the Steele dossier, even though it was, according to his June 2017 testimony, salacious

125
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,220
and unverified.

126
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,740
While the FISA application relied on Steele's past record of credible reporting on other

127
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,220
unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations.

128
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,300
Furthermore, Deputy Director McCabe testified before the committee in December 2017 that

129
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,680
no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.

130
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,860
The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign advisor George

131
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,860
Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page

132
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,860
and Papadopoulos.

133
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,220
The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation

134
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,620
in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strozik.

135
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,680
Strozik was reassigned by the Special Counsel's Office to FBI Human Resources for improper

136
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,960
text messages with his mistress, FBI attorney Lisa Page, no known relation to Carter Page,

137
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,720
where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton, whom

138
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,480
Strozik had also investigated.

139
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,000
The Strozik-Lisa-Page texts also reflect extensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,780
leaks to the media, and include a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an

141
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,600
insurance policy against President Trump's election.

142
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,760
Also, yes, that was a steam key in my mentions.

143
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,400
And yes, by the time this video goes up, I will have claimed it.

144
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Too bad, suckers.

145
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,840
Boy, there's a lot to unpack here.

146
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,080
First of all, I want to make it clear that the Nunes memo is not evidence of anything

147
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
in itself.

148
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,000
It's a description of evidence that the FBI has in its possession, that the members

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,320
of the HPSCI have viewed and reviewed personally.

150
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,080
I think it's important that the actual evidence behind this memo also sees the light of day,

151
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,620
at least in some kind of media-digestible format, which to be fair, not all evidence

152
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,880
can be, sometimes due to its very nature.

153
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,320
Secondly, a lot of people are calling the Nunes memo a dud because it focuses on Christopher

154
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,600
Steele's personal bias against Donald Trump.

155
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,720
The FBI deals in biased sources all the time, and Steele's public opposition to Trump's

156
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,600
campaign shouldn't be enough to discount his information used in the FBI's FISA

157
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
warrant application.

158
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,700
But the Nunes memo implies that it is.

159
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,240
And well, those detractors are partially right.

160
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,140
Steele's personal opinions alone aren't enough to dismiss the FISA warrant application.

161
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,820
But you know what is enough to dismiss it?

162
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,860
The fact that the money for Steele's investigations came from the Democratic National Committee

163
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,500
in the Hillary Clinton campaign, as stated in the memo.

164
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,300
But not only that, in 2016 the community organizing group, Obama for America, the group that President

165
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,680
Obama's campaign infrastructure eventually morphed into after a second presidential win,

166
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,860
also contributed money to Steele's project.

167
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,560
Moreover, the FBI corroborated Steele's data in the FISA warrant application using

168
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,860
a Yahoo News article, an article that instead of acting as an independent source of information,

169
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,520
used leaks from Steele's dossier, covertly provided by Steele himself to Yahoo News.

170
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,180
And none of these obvious conflicts of interest were included in the FISA warrant application.

171
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,060
Yeah, those facts might give the Nunes memo a bit more clout, eh?

172
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,720
It doesn't matter that Steele opposed Trump personally.

173
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,320
What matters was Steele's conduct.

174
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,580
What matters is that Obama's FBI was so willing to ignore the obvious red flags in the pursuit

175
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,580
of a political agenda.

176
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,620
There's also been criticism of Nunes himself for not personally looking at some of the

177
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,180
evidence used in the memo.

178
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,340
On the surface, this sounds like a valid criticism, but it's pretty clear that it's coming

179
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,140
from people who have no idea how politics actually works.

180
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,500
Senators and congressmen don't actually write legislation themselves, you know?

181
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,540
They have an army of aides that each study a specific strand of an issue, bring their

182
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,260
research together, construct a bill or a speech, and then the official they work for looks

183
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,940
the final product over, revises it, and receives a briefing on its contents.

184
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,680
The honest truth is, elected officials are simply too busy to spend thousands of hours

185
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,320
researching every fine grain of every issue they come across.

186
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,920
The demands of the job require that they hire people that they trust to be politically aligned

187
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,880
with them to do a lot of the legwork.

188
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,720
In the case of the Nunes memo, no, Nunes didn't actually read the FISA applications

189
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,800
themselves, as a lot of outlets are now reporting.

190
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,500
But do you know who did read them?

191
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,700
Trey Gowdy, another member of the HPSCI, and one that co-authored the Nunes memo.

192
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,800
The implication that Nunes just shat out a memo without anybody even taking a peek at

193
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,960
the evidence is a ridiculous falsehood.

194
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,480
Frankly, it's really telling that the democratic narrative switched from the Nunes memo being

195
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,960
a grave danger to national security if released, revealing intelligence sources, compromising

196
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,200
the nation, and on one occasion from Nancy Pelosi, being too complicated for the American

197
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
public to read, to the Nunes memo being a nothingburger.

198
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,120
It can't be simultaneously destructive and benign.

199
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,680
And really, you just listened to it here.

200
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,960
Did any of that sound like sensitive information?

201
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,920
Was any of it especially hard to grasp?

202
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,840
It's almost like I said in the previous video, the response to the democrats has been

203
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,720
one of desperation, grasping at anything they can.

204
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,200
It's also really telling just how firmly under the democratic thumb the mainstream

205
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,400
media is too.

206
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,160
Let's think back over the past, say, 40 or 50 years of politics.

207
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,720
Do you guys remember the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, the Iran-Contra affair?

208
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,680
Do you remember any situation in the past in which the government would have preferred

209
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,360
the media simply ignored them, and the media flat out refused?

210
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,060
This whole Nunes memo situation is one of the first times I can recall that the press

211
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,160
would rather conceal government misdeeds instead of expose them.

212
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,720
Oh, but you want to talk about the Trump-Russia connection?

213
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,520
Sure, go right ahead, shit up the entire Overton window with that garbage endlessly.

214
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,560
I'm not even taking a firm stance on the Russian collusion issue right now, I'm actually

215
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,000
in the middle of the road on that one.

216
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,200
But when the media will blow up the smallest scrap of half-baked evidence, the smallest

217
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,640
whisper of 5th party hearsay, but completely shut down all reporting when it comes to a

218
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,700
government authored memo that may swing Trump's way?

219
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,840
Journalism is dead, guys, at least in the mainstream media.

220
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,160
Even the pretense of ethics is gone now.

221
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,680
And finally, if we needed a glittering reminder of the absolute cancer that the Third Way

222
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,920
Democrats are, this is it, and it's been a long time coming.

223
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,000
Ever since the Clinton years, the Democratic party has had no problems with weaponizing

224
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
apolitical branches of the government against the Republicans.

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,960
Obama's use of the FBI in this manner was only the latest incident.

226
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,920
For some reason, today's Democratic voters have completely forgotten the rapid expansion

227
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,080
of surveillance under Obama's NSA, or Bill Clinton's use of the Internal Revenue Service

228
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,820
to target his political opponents, or Filegate.

229
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,040
Of course, the left has more important things to do than worry about stuff like that.

230
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,280
Like hey, how about complaining about the State of the Union address as another way

231
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,680
to distract from the whole thing?

232
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,840
I mean, the ACLU is angry that Trump used the word America a lot, because the word America

233
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,720
is exclusionary to illegal immigrants.

234
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,520
Yes, the American Civil Liberties Union is mad at Trump, the American President, for

235
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,320
using the word America in the State of the American Union address, because illegal immigrants,

236
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,240
who have illegally immigrated to America, are going to be angry about being reminded

237
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,540
exactly whose borders they illegally crossed.

238
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,520
Jesus fucking Christ.

239
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,720
That offense doesn't stop them from crossing over, though, and it also doesn't stop those

240
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,280
poor innocent Dreamers from the last video from breaking the law, too.

241
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,360
Border agents arrest DACA recipient in Texas for smuggling immigrants.

242
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,120
It's almost like everything I fucking said in part two of this series has come to pass.

243
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,040
But this is okay, because Democrats want Dreamers and DACA, and even illegal immigrants too,

244
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,400
because that's more Democratic voters in their pocket.

245
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,160
That's why California is experimenting with granting anybody who holds a driver's license

246
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,420
the ability to vote.

247
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,300
Even illegal immigrants who hold a variation of the license, specifically for illegals.

248
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,280
Yeah, I'm just going to stop here.

249
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,380
The deeper I go down this rabbit hole, the dumber this shit gets.

250
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,940
At this point, it's a long shot that the New News memo was crafted to draw attention

251
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,200
away from the government shutdown, and I now have another reason to disbelieve that possibility.

252
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,500
If that were actually the case, it would be the dumbest Republican stratagem yet, because

253
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,860
the Democrats shutting down the government over DACA is increasingly making them look

254
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
like villains.

255
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,680
Honestly, this story has a lot of little pieces that don't fit together cleanly, but are

256
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,380
still important enough to include as context.

257
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,760
Like this older video of Comey admitting under oath that he had no knowledge of a campaign

258
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,560
by the FBI to wiretap then-candidate Trump's campaign, which we now know to be a lie.

259
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,240
The president stated, I bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that

260
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,520
President Obama was tapping my phones in October just prior to the election.

261
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,600
Director Comey, you're a good lawyer.

262
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,720
Can you make out a great case that President Obama wiretapped Mr. Trump's phones just

263
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,480
part of the election, in light of the fact you've said there's no evidence of that?

264
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,600
All I can say is what I said before, that we don't have any information that supports

265
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
those tweets.

266
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:37,040
Now, here I think you've said there's been no evidence of an illegal wiretap by President

267
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,520
Obama, is that right?

268
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,640
I've said the FBI and the Department of Justice have no information to support those tweets.

269
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,120
Or like the upcoming second memo on the FISA applications, this one authored by Adam Schiff,

270
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,200
designed to report from the other side of the issue, since the Democratic position is

271
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,740
that the Nunes memo is inaccurate.

272
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,960
The Schiff memo still hasn't been voted on, and the mainstream media is claiming that

273
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,360
the Republicans are blocking the release, when the more likely answer is that they're

274
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
still just working through the process.

275
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,960
And to be clear, I support the release of both memos, as well as the available evidence.

276
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,760
Or like Feinstein and Schiff's request that Twitter and Facebook block the Release the

277
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,240
Memo hashtag, and docks the accounts that use the hashtag to the US government.

278
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,440
All the while, groups sympathetic to the Democrats set up spam bots to flood Twitter

279
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,180
with we need to be heard loud and clear, followed by hashtag remove Nunes 12 times, followed

280
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,460
by retweet, copy and paste, let's get it everyone.

281
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,780
To summarize, I'm not sure if everything in the Nunes memo is 100% accurate.

282
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,000
But let's take a look at the situation.

283
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,560
Democrats regularly weaponize arms of the government against their opponents.

284
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,180
Democrat money was involved in obtaining the evidence, and then laundering that evidence

285
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,320
through Yahoo News, for a FISA warrant.

286
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,980
Democrats used every trick in the book to either stop the memo's release, or downplay

287
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,860
and discredit it after the fact.

288
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:53,740
And at least so far, nothing in the Nunes memo has actually been directly argued against

289
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,100
by the Democrats.

290
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,580
Taking all this into account, I'm currently leaning towards believing the Nunes memo.

291
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,420
I mean my opinion is not finalized, the Schiff memo still needs to come out, and even if

292
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,580
it never sees the light of day, the reasoning Republicans use to block it will speak volumes

293
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,580
itself.

294
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,900
Like I said earlier, I'm still on the fence regarding the whole Trump Russia thing.

295
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,180
But at the end of the day, did Obama, Hillary and other forces in the Democratic Party weaponize

296
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,460
the FBI against Trump's insurgent presidential campaign?

297
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,380
I think the answer might be yes.

298
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,460
Thank you.
