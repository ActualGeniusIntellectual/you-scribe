0	5440	US President Donald Trump gave his first State of the Union address on January 30th, 2018.
5440	8200	It was, in my opinion, an average speech.
8200	11840	Probably the highlight of it all was the story of Based Crutchman, who managed to escape
11840	15580	from North Korea after losing a leg in an accident, an event that Donald Trump used
15580	17800	to emphasize the brutality of the North Korean regime.
17800	20480	That's not to say that there weren't a few low points either.
20480	24040	Nancy Pelosi spent the entire night looking like she was playing with her dentures.
24040	28200	The Democratic side of the room booed when Trump motioned to the two sets of parents
28200	32040	of kids killed due to illegal immigrant gang violence that were in attendance.
32040	35600	And the Black Caucus looked like somebody shat in their dinner when it was announced
35600	39320	that, statistically, poor black people were economically doing better than ever.
39320	53480	I guess it's going to be hard to convince them to vote for you solely on the basis of
53480	56600	race, if they're not stuck in perpetual grinding poverty, eh guys?
56600	59740	But everybody expected the Nunes memo to drop during the State of the Union.
59740	63080	The timing was right, and it would have been a great way to decisively win that conversation
63080	64080	once and for all.
64080	66440	Personally, I'm glad that Trump didn't do it, though.
66440	69560	I don't know about you guys, but I'm fine with the State of the Union being a little
69560	71800	less partisan than normal political affairs.
71800	82080	Nonetheless, during Trump's walk out of the room, the memo did come up.
82080	83080	And there you have it.
83080	84080	Trump's agreed to release the memo.
84080	87520	And it's about at this point in the timeline of events that Democratic propaganda went
87520	88520	into overdrive.
88520	93160	But it was all for naught, because on February 2nd, 2018, the Nunes memo was finally released.
93160	94560	Let's give it a read.
94560	98120	Oh, and if you've already read it, timestamp on the screen is where you want to skip ahead
98120	99120	to.
99120	103040	This memorandum provides members an update on significant facts relating to the committee's
103040	107920	ongoing investigation into the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation
107920	112200	and their use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act during the 2016 presidential
112200	113220	election cycle.
113220	116720	Our findings, which are detailed below, raise concerns with the legitimacy and legality
116720	120700	of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and
120700	124480	represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people
124480	126300	from abuses related to the FISA process.
126300	132660	On October 21st, 2016, DOJ and FBI sought and received a FISA probable cause order,
132660	137700	not under Title VII, authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page from the FISC.
137700	141700	Page is a US citizen who served as a volunteer advisor to the Trump presidential campaign.
141700	145540	Consistent with requirements under FISA, the application had to be first certified
145540	147860	by the director or deputy director of the FBI.
147860	152420	It then required the approval of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, or the Senate-confirmed
152420	154900	Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division.
154900	160140	The FBI and DOJ obtained one initial FISA warrant targeting Carter Page and three FISA
160140	162380	renewals from the FISC.
162380	167780	As required by statute, a FISA order on an American citizen must be renewed by the FISC
167780	171440	every 90 days and each renewal requires a separate finding of probable cause.
171440	175120	Then Director James Comey signed three FISA applications in question on behalf of the
175120	178720	FBI and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one.
178720	186000	Then DAG Sally Yates, then acting DAG Dana Boente, and DAG Rod Rosenstein each signed
186000	188920	one or more FISA applications on behalf of the DOJ.
188920	193120	Due to the sensitive nature of foreign intelligence activity, FISA submissions, including renewals
193120	195320	before the FISC, are classified.
195320	198320	As such, the public's confidence in the integrity of the FISA process depends on the
198320	201360	court's ability to hold the government to the highest standard, particularly as it
201360	203360	relates to the surveillance of American citizens.
203360	207080	However, the FISC's rigor in protecting the rights of Americans, which is reinforced
207080	211000	by 90-day renewals of surveillance orders, is necessarily dependent on the government's
211000	213840	production to the court of all material and relevant facts.
213840	218520	This should include information potentially favorable to the target of the FISC application
218520	219580	that is known by the government.
219580	222640	In the case of Carter Page, the government had at least four independent opportunities
222640	226040	before the FISC to accurately provide an accounting of the relevant facts.
226040	230720	However, our findings indicate that, as described below, material and relevant information was
230720	231720	omitted.
231720	235480	The dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, the Steele dossier, on behalf of the Democratic
235480	239400	National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, formed an essential part of the
239400	241320	Carter Page FISA application.
241320	247460	Steele was a longtime FBI source who was paid over $160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign
247460	253040	via the law firm Perkins Coie and research firm Fusion GPS to obtain derogatory information
253040	254920	on Donald Trump's ties to Russia.
254920	259480	Neither the initial application in October 2016 nor any of the renewals disclose or reference
259480	264600	the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party or campaign in funding Steele's
264600	268580	efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior
268580	270400	DOJ and FBI officials.
270400	275080	The initial FISA application notes Steele was working for a named U.S. person, but does
275080	281000	not name Fusion GPS and principal Glenn Simpson, who was paid by a U.S. law firm, Perkins Coie,
281000	284720	representing the DNC, even though it was known by the DOJ at the time that political
284720	286920	actors were involved with the Steele dossier.
286920	290760	The application does not mention Steele was ultimately working on behalf of and paid by
290760	294800	the DNC and Clinton campaign, or that the FBI had separately authorized payment to Steele
294800	295960	for the same information.
295960	301440	The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016 Yahoo News
301440	305920	article by Michael Iscoff, which focuses on Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow.
305920	310100	This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information
310100	312240	leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News.
312240	316780	The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide the information
316780	317980	to Yahoo News.
317980	322220	Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News and several other
322220	326480	outlets in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS.
326480	330100	Perkins Coie was aware of Steele's initial media contacts because they hosted at least
330100	335500	one meeting in Washington D.C. in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was
335500	336500	discussed.
336500	340020	Steele was suspended and then terminated as an FBI source for what the FBI defines
340020	343940	as the most serious of violations, an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his relationship
343940	349260	with the FBI in an October 30, 2016 Mother Jones article by David Corn.
349260	352260	Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contacts with Yahoo and
352260	356940	other outlets in September before the Page application was submitted to the FISC in October,
356940	361620	but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about those contacts.
361620	365620	Steele's numerous encounters with the media violated the cardinal rule of source handling,
365620	369060	maintaining confidentiality, and demonstrated that Steele had become a less than reliable
369060	370660	source for the FBI.
370660	375100	Before and after Steele was terminated as a source, he maintained contact with DOJ via
375100	380000	then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, a senior DOJ official who worked closely
380000	382540	with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein.
382540	387060	Shortly after the election, the FBI began interviewing Ohr, documenting his communications
387060	388060	with Steele.
388060	392340	For example, in September 2016, Steele admitted to Ohr his feelings against then-candidate
392340	397620	Trump when Steele said that he was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was
397620	399660	passionate about him not being President.
399660	404160	This clear evidence of Steele's bias was recorded by Ohr at the time, and subsequently
404160	409100	in official FBI files, but not reflected in any of the Page visa applications.
409100	413880	During this same period, Ohr's wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation
413880	415600	of opposition research on Trump.
415600	419140	Ohr later provided the FBI with all of his wife's opposition research, paid for by
419140	422460	the DNC and Clinton campaign, via Fusion GPS.
422460	427340	The Ohr's relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably concealed from the FISC.
427340	432140	According to the head of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division, Assistant Director Bill Priestap,
432140	435300	corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its infancy at the time of the initial Page
435300	436700	visa application.
436700	441300	After Steele was terminated, a source validation report conducted by an independent unit within
441300	445340	FBI assessed Steele's reporting as only minimally corroborated.
445580	450420	Yet in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary
450420	455840	of the Steele dossier, even though it was, according to his June 2017 testimony, salacious
455840	457220	and unverified.
457220	461740	While the FISA application relied on Steele's past record of credible reporting on other
461740	467220	unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations.
467220	472300	Furthermore, Deputy Director McCabe testified before the committee in December 2017 that
472540	477680	no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.
477680	482860	The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign advisor George
482860	486860	Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page
486860	487860	and Papadopoulos.
487860	492220	The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation
492220	495620	in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strozik.
495620	499680	Strozik was reassigned by the Special Counsel's Office to FBI Human Resources for improper
499680	504960	text messages with his mistress, FBI attorney Lisa Page, no known relation to Carter Page,
504960	508720	where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton, whom
508720	510480	Strozik had also investigated.
510480	516000	The Strozik-Lisa-Page texts also reflect extensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating
516000	519780	leaks to the media, and include a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an
519780	522600	insurance policy against President Trump's election.
522600	525760	Also, yes, that was a steam key in my mentions.
525760	528400	And yes, by the time this video goes up, I will have claimed it.
528400	529400	Too bad, suckers.
529400	531840	Boy, there's a lot to unpack here.
531840	535080	First of all, I want to make it clear that the Nunes memo is not evidence of anything
535080	536080	in itself.
536080	539000	It's a description of evidence that the FBI has in its possession, that the members
539000	542320	of the HPSCI have viewed and reviewed personally.
542320	546080	I think it's important that the actual evidence behind this memo also sees the light of day,
546080	550620	at least in some kind of media-digestible format, which to be fair, not all evidence
550620	552880	can be, sometimes due to its very nature.
552880	557320	Secondly, a lot of people are calling the Nunes memo a dud because it focuses on Christopher
557320	559600	Steele's personal bias against Donald Trump.
559600	563720	The FBI deals in biased sources all the time, and Steele's public opposition to Trump's
563720	567600	campaign shouldn't be enough to discount his information used in the FBI's FISA
567600	568600	warrant application.
568600	570700	But the Nunes memo implies that it is.
570700	573240	And well, those detractors are partially right.
573240	577140	Steele's personal opinions alone aren't enough to dismiss the FISA warrant application.
577140	578820	But you know what is enough to dismiss it?
578820	582860	The fact that the money for Steele's investigations came from the Democratic National Committee
582860	585500	in the Hillary Clinton campaign, as stated in the memo.
585500	591300	But not only that, in 2016 the community organizing group, Obama for America, the group that President
591300	595680	Obama's campaign infrastructure eventually morphed into after a second presidential win,
595680	597860	also contributed money to Steele's project.
597860	601560	Moreover, the FBI corroborated Steele's data in the FISA warrant application using
601560	605860	a Yahoo News article, an article that instead of acting as an independent source of information,
605860	610520	used leaks from Steele's dossier, covertly provided by Steele himself to Yahoo News.
610520	614180	And none of these obvious conflicts of interest were included in the FISA warrant application.
614360	618060	Yeah, those facts might give the Nunes memo a bit more clout, eh?
618060	620720	It doesn't matter that Steele opposed Trump personally.
620720	622320	What matters was Steele's conduct.
622320	626580	What matters is that Obama's FBI was so willing to ignore the obvious red flags in the pursuit
626580	627580	of a political agenda.
627580	631620	There's also been criticism of Nunes himself for not personally looking at some of the
631620	633180	evidence used in the memo.
633180	636340	On the surface, this sounds like a valid criticism, but it's pretty clear that it's coming
636340	639140	from people who have no idea how politics actually works.
639140	642500	Senators and congressmen don't actually write legislation themselves, you know?
642500	646540	They have an army of aides that each study a specific strand of an issue, bring their
646540	651260	research together, construct a bill or a speech, and then the official they work for looks
651260	654940	the final product over, revises it, and receives a briefing on its contents.
654940	659680	The honest truth is, elected officials are simply too busy to spend thousands of hours
659680	663320	researching every fine grain of every issue they come across.
663320	666920	The demands of the job require that they hire people that they trust to be politically aligned
666920	668880	with them to do a lot of the legwork.
668880	672720	In the case of the Nunes memo, no, Nunes didn't actually read the FISA applications
672720	675800	themselves, as a lot of outlets are now reporting.
675800	677500	But do you know who did read them?
677500	682700	Trey Gowdy, another member of the HPSCI, and one that co-authored the Nunes memo.
682700	686800	The implication that Nunes just shat out a memo without anybody even taking a peek at
686800	688960	the evidence is a ridiculous falsehood.
688960	692480	Frankly, it's really telling that the democratic narrative switched from the Nunes memo being
692480	696960	a grave danger to national security if released, revealing intelligence sources, compromising
696960	701200	the nation, and on one occasion from Nancy Pelosi, being too complicated for the American
701200	704200	public to read, to the Nunes memo being a nothingburger.
704200	707120	It can't be simultaneously destructive and benign.
707120	708680	And really, you just listened to it here.
708680	710960	Did any of that sound like sensitive information?
710960	712920	Was any of it especially hard to grasp?
712920	715840	It's almost like I said in the previous video, the response to the democrats has been
715840	718720	one of desperation, grasping at anything they can.
718720	722200	It's also really telling just how firmly under the democratic thumb the mainstream
722200	723400	media is too.
723400	727160	Let's think back over the past, say, 40 or 50 years of politics.
727160	731720	Do you guys remember the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, the Iran-Contra affair?
731720	734680	Do you remember any situation in the past in which the government would have preferred
734680	738360	the media simply ignored them, and the media flat out refused?
738360	742060	This whole Nunes memo situation is one of the first times I can recall that the press
742060	745160	would rather conceal government misdeeds instead of expose them.
745160	747720	Oh, but you want to talk about the Trump-Russia connection?
747720	752520	Sure, go right ahead, shit up the entire Overton window with that garbage endlessly.
752520	755560	I'm not even taking a firm stance on the Russian collusion issue right now, I'm actually
755560	757000	in the middle of the road on that one.
757000	761200	But when the media will blow up the smallest scrap of half-baked evidence, the smallest
761200	765640	whisper of 5th party hearsay, but completely shut down all reporting when it comes to a
765640	768700	government authored memo that may swing Trump's way?
768700	771840	Journalism is dead, guys, at least in the mainstream media.
771840	774160	Even the pretense of ethics is gone now.
774160	777680	And finally, if we needed a glittering reminder of the absolute cancer that the Third Way
777680	780920	Democrats are, this is it, and it's been a long time coming.
780920	785000	Ever since the Clinton years, the Democratic party has had no problems with weaponizing
785000	788000	apolitical branches of the government against the Republicans.
788000	791960	Obama's use of the FBI in this manner was only the latest incident.
791960	795920	For some reason, today's Democratic voters have completely forgotten the rapid expansion
795920	800080	of surveillance under Obama's NSA, or Bill Clinton's use of the Internal Revenue Service
800080	802820	to target his political opponents, or Filegate.
802820	806040	Of course, the left has more important things to do than worry about stuff like that.
806040	809280	Like hey, how about complaining about the State of the Union address as another way
809280	810680	to distract from the whole thing?
810680	815840	I mean, the ACLU is angry that Trump used the word America a lot, because the word America
815840	817720	is exclusionary to illegal immigrants.
817720	823520	Yes, the American Civil Liberties Union is mad at Trump, the American President, for
823520	829320	using the word America in the State of the American Union address, because illegal immigrants,
829320	833240	who have illegally immigrated to America, are going to be angry about being reminded
833240	835540	exactly whose borders they illegally crossed.
835540	837520	Jesus fucking Christ.
837520	840720	That offense doesn't stop them from crossing over, though, and it also doesn't stop those
840720	844280	poor innocent Dreamers from the last video from breaking the law, too.
844280	848360	Border agents arrest DACA recipient in Texas for smuggling immigrants.
848360	852120	It's almost like everything I fucking said in part two of this series has come to pass.
852120	857040	But this is okay, because Democrats want Dreamers and DACA, and even illegal immigrants too,
857040	859400	because that's more Democratic voters in their pocket.
859400	863160	That's why California is experimenting with granting anybody who holds a driver's license
863160	864420	the ability to vote.
864420	868300	Even illegal immigrants who hold a variation of the license, specifically for illegals.
868300	870280	Yeah, I'm just going to stop here.
870280	873380	The deeper I go down this rabbit hole, the dumber this shit gets.
873380	876940	At this point, it's a long shot that the New News memo was crafted to draw attention
876940	881200	away from the government shutdown, and I now have another reason to disbelieve that possibility.
881200	885500	If that were actually the case, it would be the dumbest Republican stratagem yet, because
885500	888860	the Democrats shutting down the government over DACA is increasingly making them look
888860	889860	like villains.
889860	893680	Honestly, this story has a lot of little pieces that don't fit together cleanly, but are
893680	896380	still important enough to include as context.
896380	900760	Like this older video of Comey admitting under oath that he had no knowledge of a campaign
900760	905560	by the FBI to wiretap then-candidate Trump's campaign, which we now know to be a lie.
905560	909240	The president stated, I bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that
909240	914520	President Obama was tapping my phones in October just prior to the election.
914520	916600	Director Comey, you're a good lawyer.
916600	920720	Can you make out a great case that President Obama wiretapped Mr. Trump's phones just
920720	925480	part of the election, in light of the fact you've said there's no evidence of that?
925480	928600	All I can say is what I said before, that we don't have any information that supports
928600	929600	those tweets.
929600	937040	Now, here I think you've said there's been no evidence of an illegal wiretap by President
937040	938520	Obama, is that right?
938520	943640	I've said the FBI and the Department of Justice have no information to support those tweets.
943640	948120	Or like the upcoming second memo on the FISA applications, this one authored by Adam Schiff,
948120	951200	designed to report from the other side of the issue, since the Democratic position is
951200	952740	that the Nunes memo is inaccurate.
952740	955960	The Schiff memo still hasn't been voted on, and the mainstream media is claiming that
955960	959360	the Republicans are blocking the release, when the more likely answer is that they're
959360	961360	still just working through the process.
961360	964960	And to be clear, I support the release of both memos, as well as the available evidence.
964960	968760	Or like Feinstein and Schiff's request that Twitter and Facebook block the Release the
968760	973240	Memo hashtag, and docks the accounts that use the hashtag to the US government.
973240	977440	All the while, groups sympathetic to the Democrats set up spam bots to flood Twitter
977440	983180	with we need to be heard loud and clear, followed by hashtag remove Nunes 12 times, followed
983180	986460	by retweet, copy and paste, let's get it everyone.
986460	990780	To summarize, I'm not sure if everything in the Nunes memo is 100% accurate.
990780	993000	But let's take a look at the situation.
993000	996560	Democrats regularly weaponize arms of the government against their opponents.
996560	1000180	Democrat money was involved in obtaining the evidence, and then laundering that evidence
1000180	1003320	through Yahoo News, for a FISA warrant.
1003320	1006980	Democrats used every trick in the book to either stop the memo's release, or downplay
1006980	1008860	and discredit it after the fact.
1008860	1013740	And at least so far, nothing in the Nunes memo has actually been directly argued against
1013740	1015100	by the Democrats.
1015100	1019580	Taking all this into account, I'm currently leaning towards believing the Nunes memo.
1019580	1023420	I mean my opinion is not finalized, the Schiff memo still needs to come out, and even if
1023420	1027580	it never sees the light of day, the reasoning Republicans use to block it will speak volumes
1027580	1028580	itself.
1028580	1031900	Like I said earlier, I'm still on the fence regarding the whole Trump Russia thing.
1031900	1036180	But at the end of the day, did Obama, Hillary and other forces in the Democratic Party weaponize
1036180	1039460	the FBI against Trump's insurgent presidential campaign?
1039460	1041380	I think the answer might be yes.
1058580	1065460	Thank you.
