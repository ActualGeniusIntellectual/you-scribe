00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
US President Donald Trump gave his first State of the Union address on January 30th, 2018.

00:05.440 --> 00:08.200
It was, in my opinion, an average speech.

00:08.200 --> 00:11.840
Probably the highlight of it all was the story of Based Crutchman, who managed to escape

00:11.840 --> 00:15.580
from North Korea after losing a leg in an accident, an event that Donald Trump used

00:15.580 --> 00:17.800
to emphasize the brutality of the North Korean regime.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.480
That's not to say that there weren't a few low points either.

00:20.480 --> 00:24.040
Nancy Pelosi spent the entire night looking like she was playing with her dentures.

00:24.040 --> 00:28.200
The Democratic side of the room booed when Trump motioned to the two sets of parents

00:28.200 --> 00:32.040
of kids killed due to illegal immigrant gang violence that were in attendance.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.600
And the Black Caucus looked like somebody shat in their dinner when it was announced

00:35.600 --> 00:39.320
that, statistically, poor black people were economically doing better than ever.

00:39.320 --> 00:53.480
I guess it's going to be hard to convince them to vote for you solely on the basis of

00:53.480 --> 00:56.600
race, if they're not stuck in perpetual grinding poverty, eh guys?

00:56.600 --> 00:59.740
But everybody expected the Nunes memo to drop during the State of the Union.

00:59.740 --> 01:03.080
The timing was right, and it would have been a great way to decisively win that conversation

01:03.080 --> 01:04.080
once and for all.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.440
Personally, I'm glad that Trump didn't do it, though.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.560
I don't know about you guys, but I'm fine with the State of the Union being a little

01:09.560 --> 01:11.800
less partisan than normal political affairs.

01:11.800 --> 01:22.080
Nonetheless, during Trump's walk out of the room, the memo did come up.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.080
And there you have it.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.080
Trump's agreed to release the memo.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.520
And it's about at this point in the timeline of events that Democratic propaganda went

01:27.520 --> 01:28.520
into overdrive.

01:28.520 --> 01:33.160
But it was all for naught, because on February 2nd, 2018, the Nunes memo was finally released.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.560
Let's give it a read.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.120
Oh, and if you've already read it, timestamp on the screen is where you want to skip ahead

01:38.120 --> 01:39.120
to.

01:39.120 --> 01:43.040
This memorandum provides members an update on significant facts relating to the committee's

01:43.040 --> 01:47.920
ongoing investigation into the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation

01:47.920 --> 01:52.200
and their use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act during the 2016 presidential

01:52.200 --> 01:53.220
election cycle.

01:53.220 --> 01:56.720
Our findings, which are detailed below, raise concerns with the legitimacy and legality

01:56.720 --> 02:00.700
of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and

02:00.700 --> 02:04.480
represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people

02:04.480 --> 02:06.300
from abuses related to the FISA process.

02:06.300 --> 02:12.660
On October 21st, 2016, DOJ and FBI sought and received a FISA probable cause order,

02:12.660 --> 02:17.700
not under Title VII, authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page from the FISC.

02:17.700 --> 02:21.700
Page is a US citizen who served as a volunteer advisor to the Trump presidential campaign.

02:21.700 --> 02:25.540
Consistent with requirements under FISA, the application had to be first certified

02:25.540 --> 02:27.860
by the director or deputy director of the FBI.

02:27.860 --> 02:32.420
It then required the approval of the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, or the Senate-confirmed

02:32.420 --> 02:34.900
Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division.

02:34.900 --> 02:40.140
The FBI and DOJ obtained one initial FISA warrant targeting Carter Page and three FISA

02:40.140 --> 02:42.380
renewals from the FISC.

02:42.380 --> 02:47.780
As required by statute, a FISA order on an American citizen must be renewed by the FISC

02:47.780 --> 02:51.440
every 90 days and each renewal requires a separate finding of probable cause.

02:51.440 --> 02:55.120
Then Director James Comey signed three FISA applications in question on behalf of the

02:55.120 --> 02:58.720
FBI and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one.

02:58.720 --> 03:06.000
Then DAG Sally Yates, then acting DAG Dana Boente, and DAG Rod Rosenstein each signed

03:06.000 --> 03:08.920
one or more FISA applications on behalf of the DOJ.

03:08.920 --> 03:13.120
Due to the sensitive nature of foreign intelligence activity, FISA submissions, including renewals

03:13.120 --> 03:15.320
before the FISC, are classified.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.320
As such, the public's confidence in the integrity of the FISA process depends on the

03:18.320 --> 03:21.360
court's ability to hold the government to the highest standard, particularly as it

03:21.360 --> 03:23.360
relates to the surveillance of American citizens.

03:23.360 --> 03:27.080
However, the FISC's rigor in protecting the rights of Americans, which is reinforced

03:27.080 --> 03:31.000
by 90-day renewals of surveillance orders, is necessarily dependent on the government's

03:31.000 --> 03:33.840
production to the court of all material and relevant facts.

03:33.840 --> 03:38.520
This should include information potentially favorable to the target of the FISC application

03:38.520 --> 03:39.580
that is known by the government.

03:39.580 --> 03:42.640
In the case of Carter Page, the government had at least four independent opportunities

03:42.640 --> 03:46.040
before the FISC to accurately provide an accounting of the relevant facts.

03:46.040 --> 03:50.720
However, our findings indicate that, as described below, material and relevant information was

03:50.720 --> 03:51.720
omitted.

03:51.720 --> 03:55.480
The dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, the Steele dossier, on behalf of the Democratic

03:55.480 --> 03:59.400
National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign, formed an essential part of the

03:59.400 --> 04:01.320
Carter Page FISA application.

04:01.320 --> 04:07.460
Steele was a longtime FBI source who was paid over $160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign

04:07.460 --> 04:13.040
via the law firm Perkins Coie and research firm Fusion GPS to obtain derogatory information

04:13.040 --> 04:14.920
on Donald Trump's ties to Russia.

04:14.920 --> 04:19.480
Neither the initial application in October 2016 nor any of the renewals disclose or reference

04:19.480 --> 04:24.600
the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party or campaign in funding Steele's

04:24.600 --> 04:28.580
efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior

04:28.580 --> 04:30.400
DOJ and FBI officials.

04:30.400 --> 04:35.080
The initial FISA application notes Steele was working for a named U.S. person, but does

04:35.080 --> 04:41.000
not name Fusion GPS and principal Glenn Simpson, who was paid by a U.S. law firm, Perkins Coie,

04:41.000 --> 04:44.720
representing the DNC, even though it was known by the DOJ at the time that political

04:44.720 --> 04:46.920
actors were involved with the Steele dossier.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.760
The application does not mention Steele was ultimately working on behalf of and paid by

04:50.760 --> 04:54.800
the DNC and Clinton campaign, or that the FBI had separately authorized payment to Steele

04:54.800 --> 04:55.960
for the same information.

04:55.960 --> 05:01.440
The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016 Yahoo News

05:01.440 --> 05:05.920
article by Michael Iscoff, which focuses on Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow.

05:05.920 --> 05:10.100
This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information

05:10.100 --> 05:12.240
leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News.

05:12.240 --> 05:16.780
The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide the information

05:16.780 --> 05:17.980
to Yahoo News.

05:17.980 --> 05:22.220
Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News and several other

05:22.220 --> 05:26.480
outlets in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS.

05:26.480 --> 05:30.100
Perkins Coie was aware of Steele's initial media contacts because they hosted at least

05:30.100 --> 05:35.500
one meeting in Washington D.C. in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was

05:35.500 --> 05:36.500
discussed.

05:36.500 --> 05:40.020
Steele was suspended and then terminated as an FBI source for what the FBI defines

05:40.020 --> 05:43.940
as the most serious of violations, an unauthorized disclosure to the media of his relationship

05:43.940 --> 05:49.260
with the FBI in an October 30, 2016 Mother Jones article by David Corn.

05:49.260 --> 05:52.260
Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contacts with Yahoo and

05:52.260 --> 05:56.940
other outlets in September before the Page application was submitted to the FISC in October,

05:56.940 --> 06:01.620
but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about those contacts.

06:01.620 --> 06:05.620
Steele's numerous encounters with the media violated the cardinal rule of source handling,

06:05.620 --> 06:09.060
maintaining confidentiality, and demonstrated that Steele had become a less than reliable

06:09.060 --> 06:10.660
source for the FBI.

06:10.660 --> 06:15.100
Before and after Steele was terminated as a source, he maintained contact with DOJ via

06:15.100 --> 06:20.000
then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, a senior DOJ official who worked closely

06:20.000 --> 06:22.540
with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein.

06:22.540 --> 06:27.060
Shortly after the election, the FBI began interviewing Ohr, documenting his communications

06:27.060 --> 06:28.060
with Steele.

06:28.060 --> 06:32.340
For example, in September 2016, Steele admitted to Ohr his feelings against then-candidate

06:32.340 --> 06:37.620
Trump when Steele said that he was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was

06:37.620 --> 06:39.660
passionate about him not being President.

06:39.660 --> 06:44.160
This clear evidence of Steele's bias was recorded by Ohr at the time, and subsequently

06:44.160 --> 06:49.100
in official FBI files, but not reflected in any of the Page visa applications.

06:49.100 --> 06:53.880
During this same period, Ohr's wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation

06:53.880 --> 06:55.600
of opposition research on Trump.

06:55.600 --> 06:59.140
Ohr later provided the FBI with all of his wife's opposition research, paid for by

06:59.140 --> 07:02.460
the DNC and Clinton campaign, via Fusion GPS.

07:02.460 --> 07:07.340
The Ohr's relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably concealed from the FISC.

07:07.340 --> 07:12.140
According to the head of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division, Assistant Director Bill Priestap,

07:12.140 --> 07:15.300
corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its infancy at the time of the initial Page

07:15.300 --> 07:16.700
visa application.

07:16.700 --> 07:21.300
After Steele was terminated, a source validation report conducted by an independent unit within

07:21.300 --> 07:25.340
FBI assessed Steele's reporting as only minimally corroborated.

07:25.580 --> 07:30.420
Yet in early January 2017, Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary

07:30.420 --> 07:35.840
of the Steele dossier, even though it was, according to his June 2017 testimony, salacious

07:35.840 --> 07:37.220
and unverified.

07:37.220 --> 07:41.740
While the FISA application relied on Steele's past record of credible reporting on other

07:41.740 --> 07:47.220
unrelated matters, it ignored or concealed his anti-Trump financial and ideological motivations.

07:47.220 --> 07:52.300
Furthermore, Deputy Director McCabe testified before the committee in December 2017 that

07:52.540 --> 07:57.680
no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.

07:57.680 --> 08:02.860
The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign advisor George

08:02.860 --> 08:06.860
Papadopoulos, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page

08:06.860 --> 08:07.860
and Papadopoulos.

08:07.860 --> 08:12.220
The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation

08:12.220 --> 08:15.620
in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strozik.

08:15.620 --> 08:19.680
Strozik was reassigned by the Special Counsel's Office to FBI Human Resources for improper

08:19.680 --> 08:24.960
text messages with his mistress, FBI attorney Lisa Page, no known relation to Carter Page,

08:24.960 --> 08:28.720
where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton, whom

08:28.720 --> 08:30.480
Strozik had also investigated.

08:30.480 --> 08:36.000
The Strozik-Lisa-Page texts also reflect extensive discussions about the investigation, orchestrating

08:36.000 --> 08:39.780
leaks to the media, and include a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an

08:39.780 --> 08:42.600
insurance policy against President Trump's election.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.760
Also, yes, that was a steam key in my mentions.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.400
And yes, by the time this video goes up, I will have claimed it.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.400
Too bad, suckers.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.840
Boy, there's a lot to unpack here.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.080
First of all, I want to make it clear that the Nunes memo is not evidence of anything

08:55.080 --> 08:56.080
in itself.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.000
It's a description of evidence that the FBI has in its possession, that the members

08:59.000 --> 09:02.320
of the HPSCI have viewed and reviewed personally.

09:02.320 --> 09:06.080
I think it's important that the actual evidence behind this memo also sees the light of day,

09:06.080 --> 09:10.620
at least in some kind of media-digestible format, which to be fair, not all evidence

09:10.620 --> 09:12.880
can be, sometimes due to its very nature.

09:12.880 --> 09:17.320
Secondly, a lot of people are calling the Nunes memo a dud because it focuses on Christopher

09:17.320 --> 09:19.600
Steele's personal bias against Donald Trump.

09:19.600 --> 09:23.720
The FBI deals in biased sources all the time, and Steele's public opposition to Trump's

09:23.720 --> 09:27.600
campaign shouldn't be enough to discount his information used in the FBI's FISA

09:27.600 --> 09:28.600
warrant application.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.700
But the Nunes memo implies that it is.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.240
And well, those detractors are partially right.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.140
Steele's personal opinions alone aren't enough to dismiss the FISA warrant application.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.820
But you know what is enough to dismiss it?

09:38.820 --> 09:42.860
The fact that the money for Steele's investigations came from the Democratic National Committee

09:42.860 --> 09:45.500
in the Hillary Clinton campaign, as stated in the memo.

09:45.500 --> 09:51.300
But not only that, in 2016 the community organizing group, Obama for America, the group that President

09:51.300 --> 09:55.680
Obama's campaign infrastructure eventually morphed into after a second presidential win,

09:55.680 --> 09:57.860
also contributed money to Steele's project.

09:57.860 --> 10:01.560
Moreover, the FBI corroborated Steele's data in the FISA warrant application using

10:01.560 --> 10:05.860
a Yahoo News article, an article that instead of acting as an independent source of information,

10:05.860 --> 10:10.520
used leaks from Steele's dossier, covertly provided by Steele himself to Yahoo News.

10:10.520 --> 10:14.180
And none of these obvious conflicts of interest were included in the FISA warrant application.

10:14.360 --> 10:18.060
Yeah, those facts might give the Nunes memo a bit more clout, eh?

10:18.060 --> 10:20.720
It doesn't matter that Steele opposed Trump personally.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.320
What matters was Steele's conduct.

10:22.320 --> 10:26.580
What matters is that Obama's FBI was so willing to ignore the obvious red flags in the pursuit

10:26.580 --> 10:27.580
of a political agenda.

10:27.580 --> 10:31.620
There's also been criticism of Nunes himself for not personally looking at some of the

10:31.620 --> 10:33.180
evidence used in the memo.

10:33.180 --> 10:36.340
On the surface, this sounds like a valid criticism, but it's pretty clear that it's coming

10:36.340 --> 10:39.140
from people who have no idea how politics actually works.

10:39.140 --> 10:42.500
Senators and congressmen don't actually write legislation themselves, you know?

10:42.500 --> 10:46.540
They have an army of aides that each study a specific strand of an issue, bring their

10:46.540 --> 10:51.260
research together, construct a bill or a speech, and then the official they work for looks

10:51.260 --> 10:54.940
the final product over, revises it, and receives a briefing on its contents.

10:54.940 --> 10:59.680
The honest truth is, elected officials are simply too busy to spend thousands of hours

10:59.680 --> 11:03.320
researching every fine grain of every issue they come across.

11:03.320 --> 11:06.920
The demands of the job require that they hire people that they trust to be politically aligned

11:06.920 --> 11:08.880
with them to do a lot of the legwork.

11:08.880 --> 11:12.720
In the case of the Nunes memo, no, Nunes didn't actually read the FISA applications

11:12.720 --> 11:15.800
themselves, as a lot of outlets are now reporting.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.500
But do you know who did read them?

11:17.500 --> 11:22.700
Trey Gowdy, another member of the HPSCI, and one that co-authored the Nunes memo.

11:22.700 --> 11:26.800
The implication that Nunes just shat out a memo without anybody even taking a peek at

11:26.800 --> 11:28.960
the evidence is a ridiculous falsehood.

11:28.960 --> 11:32.480
Frankly, it's really telling that the democratic narrative switched from the Nunes memo being

11:32.480 --> 11:36.960
a grave danger to national security if released, revealing intelligence sources, compromising

11:36.960 --> 11:41.200
the nation, and on one occasion from Nancy Pelosi, being too complicated for the American

11:41.200 --> 11:44.200
public to read, to the Nunes memo being a nothingburger.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.120
It can't be simultaneously destructive and benign.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.680
And really, you just listened to it here.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.960
Did any of that sound like sensitive information?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.920
Was any of it especially hard to grasp?

11:52.920 --> 11:55.840
It's almost like I said in the previous video, the response to the democrats has been

11:55.840 --> 11:58.720
one of desperation, grasping at anything they can.

11:58.720 --> 12:02.200
It's also really telling just how firmly under the democratic thumb the mainstream

12:02.200 --> 12:03.400
media is too.

12:03.400 --> 12:07.160
Let's think back over the past, say, 40 or 50 years of politics.

12:07.160 --> 12:11.720
Do you guys remember the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, the Iran-Contra affair?

12:11.720 --> 12:14.680
Do you remember any situation in the past in which the government would have preferred

12:14.680 --> 12:18.360
the media simply ignored them, and the media flat out refused?

12:18.360 --> 12:22.060
This whole Nunes memo situation is one of the first times I can recall that the press

12:22.060 --> 12:25.160
would rather conceal government misdeeds instead of expose them.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.720
Oh, but you want to talk about the Trump-Russia connection?

12:27.720 --> 12:32.520
Sure, go right ahead, shit up the entire Overton window with that garbage endlessly.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.560
I'm not even taking a firm stance on the Russian collusion issue right now, I'm actually

12:35.560 --> 12:37.000
in the middle of the road on that one.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.200
But when the media will blow up the smallest scrap of half-baked evidence, the smallest

12:41.200 --> 12:45.640
whisper of 5th party hearsay, but completely shut down all reporting when it comes to a

12:45.640 --> 12:48.700
government authored memo that may swing Trump's way?

12:48.700 --> 12:51.840
Journalism is dead, guys, at least in the mainstream media.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.160
Even the pretense of ethics is gone now.

12:54.160 --> 12:57.680
And finally, if we needed a glittering reminder of the absolute cancer that the Third Way

12:57.680 --> 13:00.920
Democrats are, this is it, and it's been a long time coming.

13:00.920 --> 13:05.000
Ever since the Clinton years, the Democratic party has had no problems with weaponizing

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
apolitical branches of the government against the Republicans.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.960
Obama's use of the FBI in this manner was only the latest incident.

13:11.960 --> 13:15.920
For some reason, today's Democratic voters have completely forgotten the rapid expansion

13:15.920 --> 13:20.080
of surveillance under Obama's NSA, or Bill Clinton's use of the Internal Revenue Service

13:20.080 --> 13:22.820
to target his political opponents, or Filegate.

13:22.820 --> 13:26.040
Of course, the left has more important things to do than worry about stuff like that.

13:26.040 --> 13:29.280
Like hey, how about complaining about the State of the Union address as another way

13:29.280 --> 13:30.680
to distract from the whole thing?

13:30.680 --> 13:35.840
I mean, the ACLU is angry that Trump used the word America a lot, because the word America

13:35.840 --> 13:37.720
is exclusionary to illegal immigrants.

13:37.720 --> 13:43.520
Yes, the American Civil Liberties Union is mad at Trump, the American President, for

13:43.520 --> 13:49.320
using the word America in the State of the American Union address, because illegal immigrants,

13:49.320 --> 13:53.240
who have illegally immigrated to America, are going to be angry about being reminded

13:53.240 --> 13:55.540
exactly whose borders they illegally crossed.

13:55.540 --> 13:57.520
Jesus fucking Christ.

13:57.520 --> 14:00.720
That offense doesn't stop them from crossing over, though, and it also doesn't stop those

14:00.720 --> 14:04.280
poor innocent Dreamers from the last video from breaking the law, too.

14:04.280 --> 14:08.360
Border agents arrest DACA recipient in Texas for smuggling immigrants.

14:08.360 --> 14:12.120
It's almost like everything I fucking said in part two of this series has come to pass.

14:12.120 --> 14:17.040
But this is okay, because Democrats want Dreamers and DACA, and even illegal immigrants too,

14:17.040 --> 14:19.400
because that's more Democratic voters in their pocket.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.160
That's why California is experimenting with granting anybody who holds a driver's license

14:23.160 --> 14:24.420
the ability to vote.

14:24.420 --> 14:28.300
Even illegal immigrants who hold a variation of the license, specifically for illegals.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.280
Yeah, I'm just going to stop here.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.380
The deeper I go down this rabbit hole, the dumber this shit gets.

14:33.380 --> 14:36.940
At this point, it's a long shot that the New News memo was crafted to draw attention

14:36.940 --> 14:41.200
away from the government shutdown, and I now have another reason to disbelieve that possibility.

14:41.200 --> 14:45.500
If that were actually the case, it would be the dumbest Republican stratagem yet, because

14:45.500 --> 14:48.860
the Democrats shutting down the government over DACA is increasingly making them look

14:48.860 --> 14:49.860
like villains.

14:49.860 --> 14:53.680
Honestly, this story has a lot of little pieces that don't fit together cleanly, but are

14:53.680 --> 14:56.380
still important enough to include as context.

14:56.380 --> 15:00.760
Like this older video of Comey admitting under oath that he had no knowledge of a campaign

15:00.760 --> 15:05.560
by the FBI to wiretap then-candidate Trump's campaign, which we now know to be a lie.

15:05.560 --> 15:09.240
The president stated, I bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that

15:09.240 --> 15:14.520
President Obama was tapping my phones in October just prior to the election.

15:14.520 --> 15:16.600
Director Comey, you're a good lawyer.

15:16.600 --> 15:20.720
Can you make out a great case that President Obama wiretapped Mr. Trump's phones just

15:20.720 --> 15:25.480
part of the election, in light of the fact you've said there's no evidence of that?

15:25.480 --> 15:28.600
All I can say is what I said before, that we don't have any information that supports

15:28.600 --> 15:29.600
those tweets.

15:29.600 --> 15:37.040
Now, here I think you've said there's been no evidence of an illegal wiretap by President

15:37.040 --> 15:38.520
Obama, is that right?

15:38.520 --> 15:43.640
I've said the FBI and the Department of Justice have no information to support those tweets.

15:43.640 --> 15:48.120
Or like the upcoming second memo on the FISA applications, this one authored by Adam Schiff,

15:48.120 --> 15:51.200
designed to report from the other side of the issue, since the Democratic position is

15:51.200 --> 15:52.740
that the Nunes memo is inaccurate.

15:52.740 --> 15:55.960
The Schiff memo still hasn't been voted on, and the mainstream media is claiming that

15:55.960 --> 15:59.360
the Republicans are blocking the release, when the more likely answer is that they're

15:59.360 --> 16:01.360
still just working through the process.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.960
And to be clear, I support the release of both memos, as well as the available evidence.

16:04.960 --> 16:08.760
Or like Feinstein and Schiff's request that Twitter and Facebook block the Release the

16:08.760 --> 16:13.240
Memo hashtag, and docks the accounts that use the hashtag to the US government.

16:13.240 --> 16:17.440
All the while, groups sympathetic to the Democrats set up spam bots to flood Twitter

16:17.440 --> 16:23.180
with we need to be heard loud and clear, followed by hashtag remove Nunes 12 times, followed

16:23.180 --> 16:26.460
by retweet, copy and paste, let's get it everyone.

16:26.460 --> 16:30.780
To summarize, I'm not sure if everything in the Nunes memo is 100% accurate.

16:30.780 --> 16:33.000
But let's take a look at the situation.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.560
Democrats regularly weaponize arms of the government against their opponents.

16:36.560 --> 16:40.180
Democrat money was involved in obtaining the evidence, and then laundering that evidence

16:40.180 --> 16:43.320
through Yahoo News, for a FISA warrant.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.980
Democrats used every trick in the book to either stop the memo's release, or downplay

16:46.980 --> 16:48.860
and discredit it after the fact.

16:48.860 --> 16:53.740
And at least so far, nothing in the Nunes memo has actually been directly argued against

16:53.740 --> 16:55.100
by the Democrats.

16:55.100 --> 16:59.580
Taking all this into account, I'm currently leaning towards believing the Nunes memo.

16:59.580 --> 17:03.420
I mean my opinion is not finalized, the Schiff memo still needs to come out, and even if

17:03.420 --> 17:07.580
it never sees the light of day, the reasoning Republicans use to block it will speak volumes

17:07.580 --> 17:08.580
itself.

17:08.580 --> 17:11.900
Like I said earlier, I'm still on the fence regarding the whole Trump Russia thing.

17:11.900 --> 17:16.180
But at the end of the day, did Obama, Hillary and other forces in the Democratic Party weaponize

17:16.180 --> 17:19.460
the FBI against Trump's insurgent presidential campaign?

17:19.460 --> 17:21.380
I think the answer might be yes.

17:38.580 --> 17:45.460
Thank you.
