0	4980	Good morning, everyone. Dev and Naomi are back together again. We broke up for a while, but...
5660	8180	They're gonna actually believe that, you know.
11180	16780	What I mean... What I mean by this is we haven't done a Dev and Naomi talks about
17440	20920	TV or movie or whatever since I think... How was the dragon?
20920	21420	Was it?
21420	21920	It was because you're lazy.
21920	23420	Because you're lazy, too.
23420	26320	I am lazy in my own way.
26820	28320	Well, you can't even complain!
28380	30720	No, no, you're lazy when it comes to your work.
30720	32720	Listen, okay? That's not true and you know it.
33720	34720	Yes, it is.
36720	37720	That's what you get.
37720	38720	Stop.
40020	43720	So we have our morning coffees. It's reasonably in the morning for us and uh...
43720	45720	Yeah, okay.
46820	52320	We have our coffees and we're gonna be here to talk about Star Trek Picard season 3.
52320	54320	Episode 1!
54720	57720	Okay, so here. Let me give you the TLDR, alright?
57720	60720	When I first met Naomi, she didn't know what Star Trek was.
60720	61720	Yep.
61720	64720	And I was like, you know what? I think you'd actually like it. Even though it's not like...
64720	67720	You thought before me it was like just another generic sci-fi action series, right?
67720	70720	Yeah, because hashtag Star Wars was always bad.
70720	72720	How is that related?
72720	77720	Because that's another generic sci-fi series that was, you know, really popular that I didn't know that much about.
77720	80720	You're getting more beatings for that. Here they are. Here they are.
80720	81720	Ow.
82120	84120	Okay, so listen.
85120	90120	But Star Trek is not a generic sci-fi action series. It has action.
90120	93120	But it's also like, it's kind of comedic, it's kind of dramatic.
93120	95120	But it's like a procedural, you know?
95120	96120	Yeah.
96120	98120	And it's a very good procedural.
98120	102120	And it probably... it basically started the genre of what it is.
102120	104120	It's like...
105120	107120	Wait, what other shows are like Star Trek?
108120	110120	That are not Star Trek related?
110520	111520	Like other Star Trek shows?
111520	113520	And The Orville doesn't count.
113520	115520	Because it's a Star Trek parody, right?
115520	116520	Yeah. The Orville doesn't count.
116520	117520	I guess it is kind of something...
117520	123520	Well, here's the thing. If you go back really far, like before Star Trek, you can find stuff like Flash Gordon.
123520	125520	Which is very much... which is very similar.
125520	130520	But it's like... it was that way because that was like a black and white convention.
130520	132520	And they couldn't really do what they could do with tech.
132520	134520	But with Star Trek...
134520	138520	I don't know, like there's one... like firstly, Star Trek was always like an optimistic series.
138520	139520	Yeah, definitely.
139920	141920	It was never like the grim dark future.
141920	142920	It was always like...
142920	146920	You know, yeah, humanity had some bad spots and you can see some of the bad spots in Star Trek.
146920	149920	But you pulled through it and now things are like better.
149920	151920	It's like... it's a bright future overall.
152920	157920	And secondly, it was always about the characters and their relationships.
157920	160920	And they were always mature.
160920	162920	They never pulled punches.
163920	166920	The episode that comes to mind, now that I'm thinking about it,
167320	171320	is that one episode where Worf is asked to donate blood to a Romulan.
171320	173320	Of TNG, you should say.
173320	176320	Yeah, and he... and you know, Worf hates Romulans.
176320	177320	Yeah.
177320	178320	Because he's being racist.
178320	179320	He has a reason, but still.
179320	180320	Yeah, he has a...
180320	187320	I don't know, like if you know a race... like a specific race kills your entire family, spoilers.
187320	189320	You're a racist, Naomi.
189320	190320	Naomi's a racist.
190320	192320	Then you get to be a little bit racist.
192320	193320	Just a little.
193720	194720	Here's the thing.
195720	199720	You know, a show... another show, especially another show nowadays,
199720	203720	would resolve the moral dilemma by having like a third option.
203720	205720	Like just give you an easy way out.
205720	206720	But TNG didn't.
206720	212720	TNG said, listen, either you let Worf be racist and let this Romulan die
212720	217720	or you violate his rights and make him donate the blood.
217720	219720	And the show doesn't pull that punch.
219720	222720	It allows Worf to be racist and the Romulan dies
223120	224120	and then there's actually a consequence to it.
224120	226120	And it's like, OK, so...
226120	233120	It's nice because you get... it's more realistic than having that magical third option.
233120	236120	Because oftentimes in real life, you don't get the magical third option.
236120	238120	You get two shitty options and that's all you get.
238120	241120	Sometimes there's only one shitty option, but that's the conversation.
241120	242120	Yes.
242120	249120	But that was what made TNG... like all of Star Trek, but TNG especially special to me.
249120	250120	Yeah.
250520	255520	And there weren't like fucking Marvel style quips 24-7.
255520	261520	It didn't mind being a bit grimy and edgy when it had to be,
261520	264520	but that wasn't like... humans were kind of past that.
264520	269520	That wasn't the theme of any of the shows in the Star Trek universe.
269520	274520	Even the darkest show, Deep Space Nine, still had that thread of optimism going through it.
274920	279920	Because when we encounter the darker sections of Starfleet, like section 31,
279920	283920	our heroes are rightly disgusted by what they do.
283920	285920	So there's...
285920	291920	It basically... it provided like this sense of liberal optimism towards the future
291920	294920	and about how humanity is going to turn out.
294920	297920	It's not going to be perfect, it's not going to be Utopia,
297920	302920	but basically the idea that it's not going to be a fucking cyberpunk grimdark hellhole
303320	305320	where everything sucks.
305320	310320	However, after 9-11, that type of science fiction became way more...
310320	314320	it was already popular in the 80s, but it became way more popular after 9-11.
314320	318320	And they tried to like make... they tried to like update Star Trek in that way,
318320	322320	so like they did the whole like an enterprise, like the Xindi attacking Earth
322320	326320	and that didn't help the show, it still got cancelled.
326320	332320	They tried to like make it just a straight action movie with the J.J. Abrams reboot
332720	336720	and I think... like those were okay movies, but they weren't really Star Trek movies.
336720	340720	Yeah, after... like I really enjoyed those movies before I knew anything about Star Trek
340720	344720	because of course I saw those first, because I didn't watch old things before you, because you know...
344720	346720	Because you're a fucking Zoomer, I know.
346720	348720	Yeah, totally.
348720	350720	But they were... they were really good.
350720	354720	I really enjoyed watching them, but then after watching Star Trek, I'm just like...
354720	355720	Oh.
355720	356720	Yeah, that's not what they were supposed to be.
356720	357720	Oh.
357720	359720	The reason... okay, I know, here's like what Picard sees in 3 episode 1.
360120	364120	The reason I'm doing all this is because... I'm describing all this because Naomi didn't know
364120	367120	what Star Trek was really before she met me.
367120	370120	And maybe some of you watching still don't know what Star Trek is, and that's okay.
370120	371120	No, it's not.
371120	372120	You should watch it.
372120	376120	But no, we sat down, over the course of like the first half of our relationship,
376120	379120	we sat down and watched every single Star Trek.
379120	380120	Yeah, everything.
380120	381120	We started chronologically.
381120	383120	Yes, we started with the original series.
383120	385120	Which was surprisingly good.
385120	386120	For the time.
386120	388120	You have to remember that it was a 50s show?
388120	389120	60s show.
389520	390520	I think it was a 60s show.
390520	391520	I don't remember.
391520	393520	I think it was like 1969?
393520	397520	So once you go into the mindset of this is a really old show and it's not gonna be perfect,
397520	400520	but it's still gonna, you know, it's still gonna be Star Trek, it's great.
400520	401520	Yes.
401520	402520	Then we watched the animated series.
402520	403520	Yeah.
403520	404520	Which was just kind of goofy.
404520	406520	Yeah, that was goofy, but also a product of its time.
406520	407520	Yeah.
407520	408520	Yeah.
408520	409520	It's like watching Scooby-Doo again.
409520	410520	Yep.
410520	411520	Then we watched TNG.
411520	415520	But here's the thing, we watched them in order of release.
415920	420920	So back in the day, TNG, DS9, and Voyager all came out at the same time, like overlapping.
420920	421920	Yeah.
421920	423920	So we actually watched the episodes overlapping the way they came out.
423920	424920	Yeah.
424920	425920	Because I had never done that before.
425920	426920	That was a fun experience.
426920	427920	Yeah, that was interesting.
427920	428920	Yeah.
428920	429920	Yeah.
429920	431920	Going back and forth between like different casts and having to keep them all in our heads.
431920	435920	Well, yeah, but also like being able to like get the story slightly better than being like,
435920	437520	instead of instead of like watching like...
437520	438520	There was crossovers between.
438520	442920	Yeah, because there was crossovers like in later seasons and instead of being able to
443320	446320	like watching an entire series and watching the next one and being like, oh, who was that
446320	447320	person?
447320	448320	Why is this crossover relevant?
448320	449320	Yeah.
449320	450320	You actually...
450320	451320	You got it.
451320	452320	...understand why it's relevant.
452320	453320	Yeah.
453320	456320	I know Julian Bashir from DS9 was guest starring on TNG for one episode.
456320	457320	Was he?
457320	458320	Yep.
458320	459320	He was like doing...
459320	460320	I remember it on Data.
460320	461320	Oh.
461320	462320	Yeah.
462320	463320	I don't remember that.
463320	464320	It was like in season six or something.
464320	465320	I don't remember this.
465320	468320	I remember when Will came to DS9 for like a day.
468320	469320	Will?
469320	470320	Riker.
470320	472320	Oh, but it was actually Thomas Riker?
472720	473720	Oh, yeah.
473720	474720	That's right.
474720	475720	Yeah.
475720	476720	It was the duplicate.
476720	477720	But then also...
477720	478720	Spoilers.
478720	479720	Spoilers.
479720	482720	The guy who made the EMH in Voyager came to DS9 for a day too.
482720	483720	It's been too long.
483720	486520	I have to watch them all again, so I fully remember all these references.
486520	487520	Yeah.
487520	488520	We haven't watched DS9 in like three or four years.
488520	489520	Yeah.
489520	490520	It's been a while.
490520	491520	Yeah.
491520	492520	Jesus.
492520	493520	It's because we keep watching new bad Trek.
493520	498520	So the idea was we were going to go through the entire Star Trek canon in order of release.
498520	501600	So we go through all the shows, you go through Enterprise, and then I'm like, okay, Naomi,
501880	502880	here's...
502880	503880	We also watched the movies as well.
503880	504880	Yeah.
504880	505880	We did watch the movies.
505880	506880	Like all the various like TNG movies, original series movies.
506880	507880	Yeah.
507880	510000	Then we get to the reboots, we watch the reboots, and they're like, well, they're not very good.
510000	511000	But they're okay.
511000	512560	And I'm like, okay, Naomi, here's where it gets bad.
512560	514240	Now we're gonna start watching Discovery.
514240	515240	And Naomi's like...
515240	517240	And here's the thing, okay?
517240	523640	It's like Discovery season one, like, there was a skeleton of a decent show, but they
523640	525600	needed to do it completely differently, and they just didn't do it.
525600	526600	Also the Klingons.
526600	527600	Yeah.
527600	528600	In the beginning.
528600	529600	That was bad.
529600	530600	The Trump Klingons.
530600	536880	But like there was... if you just told me a bare bones synopsis of Star Trek Discovery
536880	540760	season one, I'd be like, that could be good, but it wasn't because they did everything
540760	541760	wrong.
541760	542760	Yeah.
542760	543760	But also...
543760	544760	Same with season two, actually.
544760	545760	Season two was better than season one, in fact.
545760	546760	Yeah.
546760	549440	But Discovery is a good science fiction show.
549440	551240	It's not a good Star Trek show.
551240	552240	Not a Star Trek show.
552240	556440	Like it's better now in the later seasons where we're actually...
556440	557440	In the future.
557440	560440	In the future, like attempting to re... spoilers.
560440	561440	Attempting to rebuild...
561440	562440	Civilization?
562440	563440	Because it all fell apart?
563440	564440	No.
564440	565440	Well, not civilization, but rebuild the...
565440	567440	Well, I've forgotten all of my words.
567440	568440	The Federation?
568440	569440	Thank you.
569440	570440	Jesus Christ.
570440	571440	Yes, it is early in the morning for Naomi.
571440	572440	Holy fuck.
572440	573440	Drink some more of that coffee over there.
573440	574440	Why don't you?
574440	575440	I'm going.
575440	576440	I've already half done.
576440	577440	It's not helping.
577440	578440	Okay.
578440	580280	So Star Trek Discovery season one was not very good.
580280	585040	Star Trek Discovery season two was better, but I think it was just... looking back on
585040	586040	that.
586040	589800	I think it was just for the fan service because you had Captain Pike, you had Spock.
589800	590800	You know, just having...
590800	591800	You had number one come back.
591800	592800	Yeah.
592800	593800	You know, I think...
593800	594800	And you had the Enterprise.
594800	595800	The original Enterprise.
595800	596800	Yeah.
596800	597800	I think it was all just fan service for season two.
597800	599440	Season three was like...
599440	600440	That's when we went to the future?
600440	601440	Yeah.
601440	602440	They went to the future.
602440	603440	Right.
603440	604440	Yes.
604440	605440	That's where it started getting better.
605440	606440	Yeah.
606440	607440	Yeah.
607440	608440	And season three and season four are now like...
608440	609440	mediocre.
609440	617080	It's about as good as like a slightly bad episode of Voyager, which is still pretty
617080	618880	bad, but it's better than it has been.
618880	621160	No, I don't know.
621160	624720	I think they're on par with like a mediocre episode of Voyager.
624720	628080	You know, like not a specifically bad episode, but like a mediocre episode, you know?
628080	629080	Yeah.
629080	630080	Okay.
630080	631080	Like, yeah, I watched it and it was, you know, it was okay.
631080	632080	You know.
632080	634200	You know, we watched Lower Decks, which is just a comedy show and it's funny for a comedy
634200	635200	show.
635200	636200	Yeah.
636200	638840	Lower Decks is like actually pretty good, but it's like... it's a comedy show.
638840	639840	It's strictly comedy.
639840	640840	Yeah.
640840	641840	And you have to know all the Star Trek references.
641840	643080	You're like, oh, Tom Parrish was up in this episode.
643080	644080	Yeah.
644080	646600	Like you have to have seen all of Star Trek to get it, but for what it is, it's good.
646600	647600	Yeah.
647600	648600	I really enjoy Lower Decks.
648600	649600	Yeah.
649600	651800	If you haven't seen all of Star Trek, you're not gonna really like it that much.
651800	652800	No.
652800	656720	And like, it's very specifically like, yes, this is part of the Star Trek universe, but
656720	662240	it's also like, here's a shit ton of fan service and like just goof about the Star Trek universe.
662240	663240	Yeah.
663240	664240	But it's good.
664240	665240	I enjoyed it.
665240	667920	And of course, we mentioned the Orville briefly because the Orville is literally just TNG
667920	668920	again.
668920	669920	And I can kind of enjoy that.
669920	670920	Yeah.
670920	671920	I mean, I will say I do.
671920	674520	Okay, guys, I really, really like the Orville and this is probably going to be shown as
674520	676920	a bad take, at least according to things I've seen online.
676920	677920	Yeah.
677920	678920	Yeah.
678920	686360	But I, in the latest season of the Orville, I miss the comedy that was in season one.
686360	687360	Yeah.
687360	689520	Season three, like I think Seth MacFarlane was like, I can do a real show now.
689520	690520	It's like, no, it's supposed to be a comedy.
690520	691520	It's a parody.
691520	692520	You gotta chill the fuck out.
692520	693520	It's a parody.
693520	694520	But he wanted to try and make it like a real show.
694520	700280	The thing is, I still like it, but I actually really miss all the comedy in season one because
700280	705560	now it just feels like a generic Star Trek adjacent.
705560	706560	You know?
706560	708040	I'm not saying it's a bad show.
708040	714080	I just, I felt like it was more unique when it was more, not like, yeah, it was a parody,
714080	723480	but it didn't specifically mention Star Trek things, but it was a unique, this is obviously
723480	725200	a Star Trek reference show.
725200	726200	They can't see you with your hands.
726200	727200	I don't care.
727200	728200	This is for me.
728200	730200	Naomi is dressing with her hands right now.
730200	732520	It's for me to help me focus, goddammit.
732520	733520	Okay, tell me about it.
733520	739480	It didn't specifically comment that it was a Star Trek show.
739480	740480	You know?
740480	744760	It just like, if you've seen Star Trek and you watch the show, you're just like, oh yeah,
744760	747520	this is kind of like Star Trek, but with a lot more comedy.
747520	752960	And I felt that it was, it was very unique for, but now in the latest season, I'm just
752960	757780	like, this is mildly boring and I'm not laughing as nearly as much as I did, you know?
757780	759120	But it's still a good show.
759120	763760	I just miss what it was, but I understand wanting to move on from that.
763760	764760	I just wish-
764760	765760	Yeah, they shouldn't have.
765760	766760	They shouldn't have.
766760	767760	I just wish they didn't.
767760	768760	That's just my personal opinion.
768760	771760	I'm sure a lot of the commenters aren't going to like it, but that's okay.
771760	775120	No, I'm pretty sure that I'll actually agree with you if they have a brain.
775120	779740	So listen, listen, to quickly go through this then, because we're getting bogged down.
779740	781840	We watched Star Trek Prodigy, which is the kid's show.
781840	783840	It's good for a kid's show.
783840	784840	It's written for children.
784840	785840	It's a children's show.
785840	789960	If you like Star Trek and you don't like shows written for children, don't watch it.
789960	790960	Yeah.
790960	791960	But you know what?
791960	794820	It's basically set up so that if you're a parent and you're a longtime Trek fan and
794820	798280	you want to get your kids into Star Trek, what you could do is you could sit down, watch
798280	799380	this with your kids.
799380	801920	They're going to enjoy it as a kid's show and you're going to enjoy all the, all the
801920	805780	lore references because Janeway comes back, Chakotay comes back.
805780	806780	They have like-
806780	807780	Comes back.
807780	808780	Spoilers.
808780	812940	The Cindy's show up for a little bit, you know, the, the Tellarites show up for a little
812940	813940	bit.
813940	814940	Yeah.
814940	817220	There's, there's a bunch of lore that's built into the show.
817220	820460	And there's a lot more aliens, so that's neat.
820460	821460	Yeah.
821460	822460	Yeah.
822460	824020	We watched Strange New Worlds.
824020	826540	That was the, the Christopher Pike box show.
826540	827540	It's so good.
827540	828540	It's okay.
828540	829860	Well, there's still some serious problems with it.
829860	830860	Okay.
830860	831860	I don't care.
831860	832860	You know what?
832860	833860	After watching Picard.
833860	834860	Okay.
834860	835860	So it's such a good show.
835940	842420	Strange New Worlds is, it is actually kind of a delight just because it is Trek again.
842420	846620	Now it still has the Marvel quips that I'm kind of getting tired of at this point and
846620	855780	being in fucking everything, but they had self-contained one episode stories, you know,
855780	857340	they had like their villains of the week.
857340	860420	They had their going around, going to different plants, having adventures.
860420	864280	They structured it like an actual Star Trek show.
864760	870040	You have characters that we know like Christopher Pike and Spock and number one, Christopher
870040	871040	Pike.
871040	872280	The actor is way too hot.
872280	874800	Listen, you were also into Spock when we first met.
874800	875800	Remember?
875800	876800	Yeah.
876800	877800	You just like all of them.
877800	878800	You fucking, you Horno.
878800	879800	Yeah.
879800	880800	You like all the girls too, I bet.
880800	881800	Yeah.
881800	882800	Do you like Ortega?
882800	885080	The girl with like the short hair on the sides?
885080	886080	Probably.
886080	887080	Yeah.
887080	888080	Honestly.
888080	889520	I don't remember anyone's name is anymore from anything.
889520	893760	I know that you like the fucking blue GF girl from Lower Decks.
894760	895760	Yeah.
895760	898760	Because you just want a blue girl.
898760	899760	Yeah.
899760	902040	Blue is my favorite color.
902040	903760	How can I not want a girl who's blue?
903760	905760	I'll take the man who's blue too.
905760	906760	Yeah.
906760	908760	Oh, the one that was blind?
908760	909760	Well, no.
909760	910760	I mean, just a blue man.
910760	911760	Oh, you're ableist.
911760	913760	Oh my God, Naomi.
913760	917920	Ableist and racist because he was an Aenar, so all of his race is blind.
917920	918920	It's part of his race.
918920	920180	I can't fucking believe you, Naomi.
920180	922800	How terrible of a person are you?
922840	923840	Wasn't he Andorian?
923840	926840	He was just a sub race of the Andorians?
926840	928840	Yeah, the Aenar are all blind.
928840	931840	That's not being racist.
931840	935340	Listen, if a quality of your race is that you can't see and then you're like, I don't
935340	936840	like people who can't see, you're being racist towards them.
936840	938840	I didn't say I don't like people who can't see.
938840	940840	I just said I don't want to date someone who can't see.
940840	941840	Naomi.
941840	942840	Oh, wow.
942840	943840	Listen, if you wouldn't-
943840	944840	Fine.
944840	945840	You know what?
945840	946840	If you go blind, I'm dumping you.
946840	947840	In 2023, if you wouldn't date a trans woman, you're a transphobics.
947840	951400	Therefore, if you wouldn't date a blind person, you're blindphobic.
951400	952400	That's how it works.
953000	954000	Fine.
954000	956000	If you wouldn't date a Muslim, you're Islamophobic, too.
956000	957000	Okay.
957000	958000	Fine.
958000	960000	You're just like, gigachad, yes.
960000	961000	Fine.
961000	962000	I'll take it.
962000	963000	Okay.
963000	964000	Fine.
964000	970360	But anyway, Strange New Worlds, good show, as close to as close to old Star Trek as Ugan.
970360	971360	Yeah.
971360	972360	And enjoyable.
972360	973360	After Discovery.
973360	974360	Yeah.
974360	977800	So basically, in Discovery season two, the main cast goes off to the future.
977800	979480	The side cast stays behind.
979480	984440	And then season one of Strange New Worlds continues with the side cast story with Pike
984440	985440	and Spock.
985440	986440	Yes.
986440	987440	Because they are the side cast of Discovery season two.
987440	988440	Yes.
988440	992160	So basically, all the new Star Trek shows have never really hit the heights of good
992160	993760	TNG or good DS9.
993760	995960	They've never gotten there.
995960	996960	But-
996960	997960	Strange New Worlds is the closest.
997960	998960	It's the closest.
998960	1004720	And Strange New Worlds is as good as, in my opinion, an average episode of TNG.
1004720	1006240	Yeah, which is really good.
1006240	1007240	Which is still pretty good.
1007680	1015760	You know, Discovery is now like a mediocre episode of Voyager, which is not as good.
1015760	1017840	It's watchable, but it's not as good.
1017840	1021960	And then the other shows are all like gimmicks, because the kid show, the cartoon show, you
1021960	1022960	know.
1022960	1023960	Then you have Picard.
1023960	1026080	And then you have Picard.
1026080	1028640	We finally got there, like 20 minutes or whatever later.
1028640	1029640	Okay.
1029640	1030640	Well, you know what?
1030640	1031640	The Star Trek universe is a large-
1031640	1032640	It's large.
1033080	1034080	Because-
1034080	1037500	Da da da da da da da da.
1037500	1038500	Okay.
1038500	1040500	Da da da da da da.
1040500	1050160	So, they set up in Discovery season three, a storyline where Empress Georgiou goes back
1050160	1051620	in time.
1051620	1053220	Do you recall?
1053220	1054220	Yes.
1054220	1055400	And she leaves the show.
1055400	1059480	And that's supposed to be the setup for a section 31 show because she's going to be
1059480	1060480	the star of it.
1060480	1061480	Yeah.
1061480	1067000	So far that hasn't happened yet. And the reason that it hasn't happened is because Paramount only,
1067560	1073080	they set aside a budget for five shows at once. They're only making five Star Trek shows at once.
1074040	1080040	And the Christopher Pike and Spock, like first of all, all their shows have fucking failed and
1080040	1086760	sucked. But fans loved Pike and Spock so much in Discovery Season Two, they were like, everyone
1086760	1090520	on the internet was like, give these guys their own show, make a show, make a show, make a show,
1090520	1094680	and they're like, oh my god, everything about our show suck. No one likes anything,
1094680	1097960	we have to do something. And then I'm sure someone at Paramount was like, okay, fucking
1098520	1102440	this is the only thing anyone likes, make this show. So they're like, okay, if we're making
1102440	1106520	Strange New Worlds, we've got to preempt a show. What are we doing? We can't preempt Discovery,
1106520	1110440	it's the flagship. We can't preempt Picard, because we just spent like a billion dollars
1110440	1115160	getting Patrick Stewart back. So I guess we'll just cancel the section 31 one.
1116040	1120280	So basically, what they did was until Picard is done, because they only have Patrick Stewart for
1120760	1128120	three seasons. They shelved section 31. That show's not happening till Picard is done. And then it
1128120	1134120	will take the Picard slot. So instead of what might be an okay show in section, we don't know,
1134120	1139880	we don't know. Georgiou is fucking baller. Yeah, she's pretty fun. She's a badass bitch and I love
1139880	1143320	her. But like the other characters from section 31 that they introduced back in the Discovery
1143320	1149240	era were not very interesting. Picard is like the albatross hanging around the entire Star Trek
1149240	1158120	franchise because Picard's season one and two. They're not just bad Star Trek. They're bad TV.
1158120	1164200	They are I think the worst TV I've ever seen. No, I can't think of anything worse. Like they're
1164200	1168760	I feel like there's probably shows we haven't watched that are worse. You've never seen Heroes,
1168760	1172680	right? Uh, I saw some of it like season one or two. Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. Like
1172680	1177160	afterwards. I don't know because I haven't seen it. But that's what the internet says. So I have
1177160	1185880	to believe them. Fair enough. The worst episode of, you know, pre Alex Kurtzman Trek was probably
1185880	1190120	Voyager's threshold where they go faster than warp 10 and then like turn into salamanders.
1190120	1195240	Yeah, that was a weird episode. That was like abysmally bad. Yeah, that was very bad. That was
1195240	1201560	a weird episode. And Picard is like, it's not just slightly it's not on par. It's worse than
1201960	1208040	it's not just slightly worse. It is significantly worse. Like Picard. Picard goes from like,
1208040	1213320	like you can't even laugh at how bad it is. No, we tried. It didn't work. Naomi,
1213320	1217640	you watched it and you legitimately got went into a depression. Yeah. Like I
1218360	1223080	wait. It was the last episode of season two or one. I don't remember. What happened in it?
1223080	1229880	I don't remember. Half of this is like just going out of my brain as I'm saying it.
1229880	1234040	Once season three of Picard is done and Patrick Stewart is safely in the fucking grave.
1234600	1238200	I'm going to like, I'm sure he'll die immediately after this. If anything, keep him alive is the
1238200	1246200	Star Trek books. But like, as soon as yeah, Naomi, as soon as the show is done, I'm going to do like
1246200	1252360	a big review like I did with Obi-Wan Kenobi for Picard because like of everything, because it's
1252360	1259160	so bad. It's so bad. But I did. I like legitimately just felt fucking depressed at how terrible this
1259160	1262680	show was. And I just like laid in bed for the rest of the day being like, nope, I'm done with
1262680	1268360	humanity. Yep. You were like, it actually like shut you down for a day because Jesus. Yeah. So
1268360	1274920	bad. Like Picard season one, they ruined Picard himself. Yeah. They ruined Data. They ruined the
1274920	1279640	Borg. They ruined the Romulans. They ruined. Yes, they did. They didn't ruin the Borg till season
1279640	1284520	two. Nope. They had the, they had the artifact that, that reclaimed Borg cube in the middle of
1284520	1289800	Romulan space they were working on. They ruined the Borg. They were in the Romulans. They ruined
1289800	1296520	seven of nine. They introduced a bunch of new characters only to ruin them. So Jurati was
1296520	1304200	terrible. Rios was terrible. He was more ruined in season two than season one, but he still was
1304200	1310920	interesting. No. Oh, actually I read online. So the shit, sorry, if her season three, the ship that
1311320	1317560	um, drug, drug girl, whatever, Rammy, Raffi, Raffi. I don't know why I keep calling her
1317560	1322120	Remy. I don't know either. Is there, do you know her like a Remy? Remy sounds like a familiar name.
1322120	1327000	I don't know a Remy, but there's definitely been a Remy in some sort of media I've been consuming
1327000	1332120	recently. Oh, it's house. It's house. That's right. Yep. Did you notice that Raffi was in
1332680	1337880	Rios's old ship? Yeah. Guess what? That's not supposed to be Rios's ship. What?
1338520	1343480	They're there. No, no, no. They're reusing the same set, but it's a different ship,
1343480	1347480	but you have to make it look different. It looks the same. It's not Rios's ship.
1348760	1355400	Moving on, moving on. How angry with that. I'm annoyed. Okay. They fucked like Elnor was a big
1355400	1360120	fucking waste. The Romulan, the Romulan Ninja. Okay. I want to point out that you're talking
1360120	1364760	about season one and like most of these characters got more ruined in season two. Season two was
1364760	1369720	worse than season one was. Yeah, I'm just going, okay, so here, here, fine, fine, fine. I'll
1369720	1374680	rewind it then. Fuck. All right. Here's everything that Star Trek Picard ruined in seasons one and
1374680	1379720	two. Okay. Picard and his relationships to the entire old cast by replacing with a new cast that
1379720	1383960	all suck. All the new characters that were added were introduced. They were terrible. And then they
1383960	1388760	were ruined over the course. Like they were made even worse. So Jurati was terrible. Raffi was
1388760	1394760	terrible. Fucking Rios was terrible. Elnor was terrible. They ruined Seven of Nine. They ruined
1394760	1400360	Seven of Nine's relationship with Janeway by basically like, like she just, she does so many
1400360	1404440	things that are like completely against her character arc in Voyager. It's like, remember
1404440	1410360	when she goes and like gets revenge for Icheb's fucking murder. Yeah. And like, he just has like
1410360	1417560	a gruesome murder for no fucking reason. Other than because the, the actor that played Icheb
1417560	1423240	back in the 90s spoke out against, there was some drama that he spoke out against and the,
1423240	1427960	and the, and the Star Trek company like turned on him for it because it was against another actor
1427960	1431240	and the, it was, it was, I don't know the full details. If I ever make a, if I ever make a big
1431240	1435400	video, I'll get the details. But like, I do recall it was fucking stupid. All right. And they just
1435400	1439080	pedally like had his character ripped apart for no fucking reason. They, they ruined the Borg. They
1439080	1444760	ruined the Borg Queen specifically by making fucking, that was really bad. Yeah. They made,
1444760	1451560	they made Jurati. So back in time, in the second season, in the second season, they're in 2024,
1451560	1457880	Jurati becomes the board queen. Yep. She then survives all the way through TNG and Voyager.
1457880	1463480	And it's like, hold on. So Jurati was in charge of, yeah. So the whole, why, what, why did you
1463480	1469000	get, if Jurati was on our side the whole time, why did she do all that shit? It was so bad. No,
1469000	1473080	no, no. They time traveled back. Remember? No, no, no, no. I think the Borg did. Yeah,
1473080	1478360	they did too. No, they didn't. You sure? No. What happened was Jurati took Rios' ship,
1478360	1486920	which by the way, Rios' ship is now gone. Oh yeah. But they took Rios', she took Gios' ship
1486920	1492120	and then she flew off to the Borg Collective to become its queen. Yeah. Make the Borg good.
1492120	1497000	And so. Make the Borg good. And basically over the next however many years it has been.
1497640	1501160	Yeah. She gets to the Collective, she takes over, she becomes the queen.
1501560	1508520	The issue is that in the actual timeline, the Borg attacked Earth several times,
1509400	1513160	the Borg attacked Voyager several times, the Borg assimilated 709's family, like the Borg
1513160	1516520	did all this terrible shit and Jurati was apparently at the head of it the whole time.
1517640	1524120	Why? None of it makes sense. None of it makes sense. I swear. They ruined Q. Oh God. Yeah,
1524120	1528200	that was. They fucking ruined Q. That was unfortunate. They brought back Wil Wheaton
1528200	1532760	for one like. That was stupid. When Wil Wheaton came back in season two,
1532760	1538440	he looked like Wil Wheaton, not like Wesley Crusher. I was just like, hey, that's Wil Wheaton.
1538440	1543960	And I was like, wait, who did he play again? Oh shit, that's right, it's Wesley. But he's not
1543960	1547400	actually Wesley, he's just fucking Wil Wheaton. He's just Wil Wheaton and I was just like,
1547400	1552360	he should have shaved. At least that, yeah. He should have like, not because the character
1552360	1557400	can't grow up, but because we haven't seen the character since he was a teenager.
1558200	1563240	So he should have shaved to make himself look younger. So and they they fuck. Oh yeah,
1563240	1569240	they ruined like the Khan shit. Project Khan. Remember that? Oh yeah. Yeah. I think with the
1569240	1575560	exception of the Dominion War, Picard season one and two touched on every single popular,
1575560	1583160	beloved component of Star Trek lore and then raped it. All of it. All of it. And now it's all
1583160	1590760	ruined. And also, there wasn't even any, it wasn't well acted, it wasn't well written.
1590760	1596920	The characters weren't interesting. No. And there's so many plot holes. Where did that
1596920	1601240	Romulan guy go? Which one? The villain at the end of season one. I don't even remember who
1601240	1606040	the villain was. He was just like, he was locked up and he was like, I'm here to save the world.
1606040	1611480	And then he just disappears from the show. He's never seen him again. Yep. Right? Okay,
1611720	1617560	there's apparently another dimension full of synthetic life forms that can be called through
1617560	1626760	a portal to destroy all biological life. Mass Effect style, by the way. Season one's dilemma,
1626760	1630600	which was taken was straight from Mass Effect. It's the fucking Reapers. I want to point out
1630600	1635800	that as we were watching it for the first time, Dev was just screaming, it's the fucking Reapers.
1636760	1641480	Like throughout the entire episode. It was obvious. I know, but you were just
1641480	1646280	yelling it at the TV throughout like the whole episode. Yep. And that's just,
1646280	1651240	oh, they closed the portal, then it's unresolved. Okay. In season two, the entire setup for season
1651240	1657320	two, the going back in time, Jiradi becomes the Borg queen. There's always like commentary about
1657320	1662440	Trump and capitalism and fucking and like homelessness in LA and environmentalism. Oh
1662440	1668920	my God. Everything in season two. And then they get back to the present. It turns out the whole
1668920	1677000	endeavor was to reveal that Jiradi was actually the queen of the Borg and the Borg were there to
1677000	1681800	help stop a random anomaly that was coming out of a portal. It was a big energy beam and they
1681800	1684840	force it back in the portal and they close it. And then it's several ships and then it's done.
1684840	1691400	Yeah. It was never explained and fucking Elnor dies. And then he's like, they hail their ship
1691400	1695000	and then there's like, Elnor's like, I just woke up here on the other ship, dude. It's like,
1695000	1703240	listen, you weren't even there before. You're a cadet. Like, listen, I'm going to have to do like
1704200	1709720	a huge video on just how bad seasons one and two were. You're actually going to have to
1709720	1714680	separate it into like at least three videos. They were the worst TV I've seen. Yeah. That
1714680	1719400	was pretty bad. On a technical level, on a writing level, on an acting level, on a lore level, like
1719400	1723640	everything was bad. Yeah. There was like, okay, here, you know what? They tug at the heartstrings
1723640	1729480	in two scenes, one when Data dies, two when Q dies, when Q dies, when Q says goodbye. That's
1729480	1734200	it. And you know what? The entire seasons were set up. Yeah. So you have to wade through just
1734200	1738440	tons of bullshit. And they're like, you'll forget about it because you felt something when you saw
1738440	1743080	a character that you remember from your childhood die. And it's like, I see what you're doing,
1743080	1750120	but I'm not. That's fucking stupid. All right. Yep. Yep. Yep. So the thing is,
1751160	1754200	what I'm getting at half hour in, I haven't gotten to the actual show we're talking about.
1754200	1758120	Yeah. Well, we got to the actual show, which is not this season. What I'm getting at is that
1758120	1762520	the cards season one and two were the worst TV I've ever seen in my life. Worst Trek,
1762520	1766440	worst TV. They're both super bad. Worse than any movie that I've seen.
1767240	1771080	Well, what about some of the bad movies? You know what? I'll sit down and watch
1771080	1776440	Schizophrenia. I can laugh at it. I can't laugh it. No, but no. Okay. I'm gonna,
1776440	1780280	I'll get a few laughs at a driller killer. Shout out to red letter media here with their best of
1780280	1785960	the worst series. I'm sure that a few movies on there, they made it look good because we,
1785960	1789480	they didn't, we didn't have to watch the full thing they did. I watched some of those movies
1789480	1793000	though. I watched some of those movies and I enjoyed watching better ones. I enjoyed watching
1793000	1798600	them more. Okay. I enjoyed watching them more than fucking Picard. Okay. Well, cause here's the
1798600	1804440	thing, like a bad movie is sometimes it's funny bad. Sometimes a really bad movie is just boring.
1804440	1811880	Okay. It's very rare that a show becomes like personally offensive. And that is what Picard is.
1813160	1816520	It's worse than funny bad. Cause you can have a good time. It's worse than boring cause you're
1816520	1820520	just bored. But now it's like, Oh, here's the thing that you love and we're going to ruin it
1820520	1826680	actively. That makes it like so much worse. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty bad. It's really bad.
1827240	1831480	So we get to, we get to season three of Picard and Naomi's like, I don't want to watch it.
1831480	1838360	I don't want to fuck you. We watched it. No, you watched it first. And then you were just
1838360	1843960	like, listen, it's not as bad as season two or season one or season two is worse though
1844600	1850520	than season one. That's my baseline. So it's not as bad as your low line. It's not a base,
1851160	1855880	whatever for now. It's the base. Cause I didn't realize that you can get lower than bedrock.
1857640	1863960	So that was like, listen, it's not as bad. And I think that you're not going to like,
1863960	1869400	hate yourself for watching this. And I was like, fine. And so we watched it together.
1869400	1872680	And here's the thing. All right. Season three, episode one of Picard.
1875080	1880840	It is about as bad as a bad episode of Voyager, which is now on par with discovery.
1881160	1887640	And the thing is, it's still really bad, but it's not like,
1887640	1893320	apocalyptically bad the way that Picard was. Yeah, no, I can't guys, my skew, my like,
1893320	1899400	is a media bad now is very skewed by Picard. So like anything that's better than Picard,
1899400	1904360	I'm just like, it's great. The fucking Rotten Tomatoes scores for Picard season
1904360	1909080	three are through the roof. And I'm like, listen, listen, it's not a 90. It's not a 100. This is
1909080	1917080	like a show that is like, maybe a 45. But that's far better than the zero. All right.
1917080	1923160	So it's season one or two, like watching watching Picard, season three, episode one
1923160	1931960	is kind of like watching Voyager threshold. And that it's really bad and really fucking stupid.
1933000	1938280	But it could be so much worse. And you know what? Can I say my piece now?
1938360	1938920	Yes, sure. Go ahead.
1938920	1943560	Is that Will fucking Riker is like keeping that show together.
1943560	1944280	He is, yeah.
1944280	1951320	Will Riker is keep Will Riker with Picard that we haven't seen in so many years is what's
1951320	1954200	what kept the episode going for me because I was just enjoying that.
1954200	1954440	Yeah.
1954440	1957320	That's all I was enjoying. I was just like, this is great. I miss Will Riker.
1957320	1958600	Having them back together again.
1958600	1960120	Yeah. Like he like...
1960120	1963640	We get some Riker in Lord X. He's kind of fun in that too.
1963640	1967240	Yeah. Will Riker is always fun everywhere he is. I like his character so much.
1968600	1972200	I like that he's like old man grumpy Riker now. He's like, oh, my knees hurt. Fuck.
1972200	1973320	I got to pee so much.
1973320	1975720	Yeah, but like he's still his character.
1975720	1976120	Yeah.
1976120	1977800	Unlike Patrick Stewart.
1978440	1983560	Yeah. So Will, like the guy who plays Will Riker. Fuck. What was his name?
1983560	1987720	I entirely forget. I'm so sorry to the actor, but you were just Will Riker to me now.
1991640	1992600	I'm not going to remember it.
1992600	1993480	No, you're not.
1993480	1995240	But you should edit it in.
1995240	1999880	Yeah, well, the the the character is still Will Riker.
1999880	2001720	Yeah. However, his old Will Riker.
2001720	2005880	Yeah. But the issue is, and this is something that we saw in Picard season one and two,
2005880	2009000	is that the character of Picard is no longer Captain Picard.
2009000	2010360	Now it's just Patrick Stewart.
2010360	2014840	Yeah. That's what it feels like, which is so it's so strange, too, because like.
2016920	2023080	I loved Patrick Stewart before Picard, but he was one of my favorite actors, like I, I, I,
2023800	2027960	unlike most people, because I watched them really young, I fucking love the X-Men movies,
2027960	2032360	the old X-Men movies. I watched them as a kid, guys. I watched it as a kid. I was biased,
2032360	2036280	but I thought I loved Patrick Stewart. And you know what? I also really liked
2036280	2041240	Patrick Stewart in American Dead. This character was of Commander Bullock. So fucking funny.
2041240	2043640	He was great. And now after watching Picard.
2043640	2045320	Also, you saw him in TNG. That was good.
2046840	2047320	Of course.
2048440	2051560	What's funny is like all through the 90s, everyone was saying if you're going to do
2051560	2054680	an X-Men movie, you have to get Patrick Stewart before they did it. Yeah.
2054680	2057720	Yeah. To play Xavier, because, like, he's the perfect character. And he was. It was great.
2057720	2063160	It was the perfect casting. And I'm just I'm so upset that I kind of hate him.
2064440	2067480	I don't I don't actually hate Patrick Stewart. I'm just I'm just.
2067480	2071880	Well, it's clear that, like, upset about this character is because of meddling by
2071880	2075640	Patrick Stewart. Well, he's an executive producer now.
2075640	2078520	And I think I think the reason they can even do the show is because they brought him in and he's
2078520	2085240	like, I want to do everything my way. And they're like, OK, OK, Mr. Star. Yep. Yep.
2085240	2086840	Also, I'm fucking 90.
2087400	2090520	Yeah. Like you like you can tell that Patrick Stewart is like
2090520	2094200	feeling his age now with the way he like moves on set and stuff.
2094200	2098600	Yeah. Will Riker. He's he's pretty old, too. But he's like, I'm still good. Let's go.
2101800	2107000	But OK, so I'm going to give you the quick overview of the plot of season three, episode one.
2107000	2113240	OK, so it starts out Beverly Crusher. She's been away from she's cut off everyone for 20 years.
2113240	2116200	She's talked to anyone. She's been off on her own ship doing something.
2116200	2119720	We don't know what you don't know what yet, but she's being attacked. There's some weird
2119720	2123400	aliens and masks. They come in with their guns, weird aliens that we can't understand
2123400	2129640	through the universe translator. I don't know if it was a writing plot hole or if is significant.
2129640	2132200	You know what it is? It's the fact that they're making an action show.
2132200	2134840	That's it. They're making like a dumb action hour show. Yeah.
2134840	2138200	So they come in, there's a firefight. And of course, you know, Beverly gets hit.
2138200	2142520	She goes, I'm bleeding. She like shoots them. She incinerates one.
2142520	2146840	It's a very normal, like sci fi action sequence. There's nothing really special about it.
2146840	2151480	And then afterwards, she sends like a really overly dramatic coded message to Picard
2151480	2158040	on a 20 year old translator or on his bed, on his old badge, which is clearly just like fan service.
2158040	2160920	But it makes sense in that she doesn't want to be picked up by Starfleet. She's like,
2160920	2162760	don't tell Starfleet I'm doing something secret out here.
2163560	2169560	I can tell you either. Fuck you. Yeah. And so the message gets to Picard and Picard is back
2169560	2175320	at the Chateau Picard. And he's like, you know what? Despite my entire character, even my entire,
2175320	2179880	my entire characterization in seasons when I'm to a Picard, I'm going to sell everything
2180440	2184200	and get rid of all my shit, including all those artifacts I've collected
2184200	2188840	before he gets the message, by the way. Yeah. Before he gets even he's even like,
2188840	2192920	man, this this flute that I got from the inner light, I just want to get rid of this thing.
2194840	2199960	And his new girlfriend is like this Romulan housekeeper of his who was in season two.
2199960	2204760	No, she's she wasn't a spy, but she was she was a spy for the Romans.
2204760	2208600	Yeah, but wasn't she a shell? Shall we are tall?
2208600	2213480	Tal Shiar. Fuck. You're a racist. I'm not racist. I forgot all the words to everything in the
2213480	2218280	English language. She was an old Tal Shiar. But then after the Romans collapsed, she like ended
2218280	2221880	up being a refugee and then she was she was just living at Picard's place. Yeah. OK, so.
2223800	2227480	Yeah, yeah. Basically, at the end of season two, they've got a relationship. Yeah. And so
2227480	2233080	also that Picard and Laris was her name there in this relationship and she's moving off to be some
2233080	2237640	kind of diplomat on another planet. And Picard's like, I'll go with you. Is she? I didn't even.
2237640	2241640	I know that's why they're moving. Oh, and Picard is like, you know what? Fuck it. I'll go with you.
2241640	2246120	I want to abandon everything on my old life and get rid of all my old stuff. Give my old painting
2246680	2250120	of the Enterprise to Geordi. I don't give a shit. I'm done with this stuff. I want to go have a new
2250120	2256360	adventure with you, my new life partner for the few years I have left. Yeah. He didn't say that.
2256360	2261080	Even though he's a robot, by the way, he's a robot. Oh, fuck. That's right. They should have
2261080	2266280	just killed him at the end of season one and then put him put like put him into like a new body or
2266280	2275000	something. You know, he's a robot. You forgot about that. I. Maybe forgot that they never
2275000	2278920	mentioned it again. They never mentioned it again. But all throughout season two and season
2278920	2290040	three, Picard's a robot now. OK, so they're going off. To have this this this new adventure,
2290040	2293400	and then he gets the message and he's like, oh, and then she looks at it and she's like,
2293400	2299640	OK, this looks legit. You got to go. And he goes off. He decides to go to ten forward,
2299640	2306040	which, by the way, now after the season's two events, that was retcon to Guinan is she aged
2306040	2310680	because she wanted to. Yeah, that was weird. That was such a weird explanation of that.
2310680	2316440	Just wanted to explain what the Goldberg being like fat in her old age. It's always aged.
2316440	2320360	Exactly. But here's the here's the issue, though. The issue. Yeah, that's right. They said that she
2320360	2325800	was ageless. Yeah. Not that she was ageless, but that we saw her back in the eighteen hundreds and
2325800	2331480	she looked the exact same as she did in the yeah, on the enterprise. Yeah, but that was also weird,
2331480	2337320	too, because fucking they show like Guinan in twenty twenty four as being really bitter. And
2337320	2342280	it's like that wasn't Guinan. And also, if they went back in time in TNG for Time's Arrow and
2342280	2346840	had this this big adventure, why didn't Guinan mention the second adventure that they had
2346840	2354520	together? It's so every all it's all focus on season one, season three focus. They all go to
2354520	2359240	ten forward, which is now a bar in L.A. Nope. You said it was L.A.? It was San Francisco. Okay.
2360040	2368920	It's now a bar in San Francisco. It was just named after deck ten forward. No, fuck. Yeah.
2368920	2372920	But now it's like apparently it's like a street address, whatever. Okay. They go to the new ten
2372920	2376840	four, which is actually the old pre enterprise ten forward that existed back in twenty fucking
2376840	2385000	twenty four in San Francisco. And Picard meets Will Riker there. Yeah. And they look over
2385960	2390280	and there's always like to try and smooth over how shit the show is. They always throw it through
2390280	2393480	a few like little references. So they're like, oh, hey, Picard, you wouldn't remember this because
2393480	2398440	you were you were still recovering from being being fucked up as the cutest. There was there
2398440	2402040	was a storyline where like there was a computer virus on this. I'm pretty sure this actually
2402040	2407080	happened. There's a computer virus in the enterprise and it added three to every single
2407080	2413960	digit in the computer. Yeah. Because Picard couldn't figure out how to get the coordinates
2413960	2420360	that Beverly had encoded into this transmission on his very old communicator because he didn't know
2420360	2428120	because of age old history lore reference. Yeah. So Beverly says the name of the virus and Will's
2428120	2432360	like, I know what that is. You don't, but I do. Yeah. And then adds three to every coordinate.
2432360	2435320	It turns out it leads to a system outside of Federation space and like, we got to go.
2435320	2440280	You got to go see what's going on out there. Yeah. So here comes the more stupidity. So this is
2440280	2445960	the stupid part. So their plan is stupid part. Their plan is to go back to Will Riker's old ship
2445960	2451080	that he hasn't been captain of in five years now of the Titan, the Titan. He goes back to the
2451080	2459080	Titan. They pretend to be doing an inspection. For frontier day. This was also a lore reference.
2459080	2465240	No. Pretty sure. Oh, you know what it was? It was 250 years after the start of enterprise where
2465240	2468520	Jonathan Archer launched the NX-01. That's what it was. They didn't say it in the show,
2468520	2473080	but that's what it is. I looked it up. So they're celebrating frontier day. There's going to be a
2473080	2479320	parade. They're going to go inspect the ship. A space parade. Yep. They get there. Seven of nine
2479320	2483240	is the second officer, first officer. Yeah. Which was very surprising. Like how did she,
2483240	2490920	she just joined Starfleet? Well, apparently it's been a while since season two. It's been several,
2490920	2495000	it's been several years. Yeah. Still only several years. They didn't say that, but yeah. Cause I
2495000	2499240	think, see, I think seven of nine was like, I mean, this is, this is part of the lore rate
2499240	2503240	by the way, because in season one, seven of nine was part of the Fenris Rangers, which is some
2503240	2507960	organization they never fucking explain. It's she was literally just like a lone ranger. Yeah.
2508600	2512440	And then in season two, she had joined Starfleet and she was like a Lieutenant or something. And
2512440	2516840	now she's a commander. Oh, did she, was she in Starfleet in season two? Okay. I actually just
2516840	2521880	forgot, but also this like makes slightly more sense then. Okay. In one year between season
2521880	2528280	one and season two. All right. They have fucking. All right. Eleanor goes from Ninja to, what was
2528280	2534600	that? Oh, it was you, Jesus Christ. Eleanor goes, goes from, Eleanor goes from Ninja to graduating
2534600	2538840	a four year Academy in one, one and a half years or something ridiculous. He's amazing.
2539800	2545960	You know, he's Legolas. You know, Kirk made a bet he could do it in three. Yeah. Yeah. And
2545960	2550920	like that was considered a feat. Yep. And then Eleanor does it in 1.5. Yeah. Okay. Sure. All
2550920	2560360	right. Rios who hates Starfleet is now a captain in Starfleet. Rejoins Starfleet. Rafi who was a
2560360	2564840	drug addict who was out on the out rejoined Starfleet. She was already part of Starfleet.
2564840	2569240	And then she just, well, so Rios was too. No, no, I know. But like Rafi, like Rios
2570200	2574760	stopped because he hated it. Cause he was already a captain, right? I forget. I thought I kind of
2574760	2581960	forget Rios, the story. I don't care for one. I remember he commanded a star ship. They got in
2581960	2586680	a battle. He lost people. And he was like, fuck this. I'm out. And then Rafi was just having
2586680	2593800	personal issues and she turned to drugs. Yeah. Seven of nine joins up. I mean,
2593800	2596600	maybe like all the stuff she did under Janeway got her some extra credit or something,
2596600	2600280	but I don't fucking know. She's she's now a Lieutenant. Well, she was also like,
2600280	2605960	she's still smart. Like you don't see it in the show at all in Picard, but like Janeway
2605960	2609640	seven and nine is like really, really smart because of all the Borg stuff. Right. So,
2609640	2617720	um, and, and Jurati, despite being convicted for murder in season one, they hand that away
2617720	2621640	in season two. They hand, they hand, they hand wave it away in season two by saying,
2621640	2627800	Oh, I'm out in parole. Cause they need me for this job. I'm helping out. Yep. So stupid. So,
2627800	2632520	but anyway, like, so all that shit changes in one year between season one and season two.
2632520	2635720	Now between season two and season three is apparently several years, but I don't know
2635720	2639640	how long it is exactly. But basically, seven of nine has been promoted. She's now a commander.
2639640	2645880	She's first mate of the Titan of the Titan. Um, the show really wants to play up the captain of
2645880	2650600	the Titan as an asshole. But he's actually correct. They, they really, like, I felt it.
2650600	2656760	Like I was like, Oh, I hate this guy because I, cause like my brain was going TNG rules, TNG.
2657400	2662200	Like I just kept going. So basically really want you to hate the captain, like really,
2663000	2666600	Picard and Riker show up and they're like, we got to like sweet talk our way into like getting out
2666600	2671560	to this, this, what is it called? The Rylak system or something? My brain is like, it was the Rio
2671560	2676680	system. I think it was Rylas, Rylos. It doesn't matter. It's, it's a, it's a far away system
2676680	2680440	inside of space. Starts with an R. We got to, we got to get, we got to sweet talk this guy into
2680440	2685000	doing it. And the guy's like, you think I'm a fucking idiot? No. Like I, I read, I know who
2685000	2690280	you guys are. You guys play loosey goosey with the rules. You're going to fucking try to get my ship.
2690280	2693800	You're going to get me fucked up. You're going to get my crew fucked up. All right.
2693800	2697560	Well, you're going to, the ship's going to get blown up or the fucking like, like, no,
2697560	2701400	I'm going to follow the rules. Fuck you. Yeah. Like, but like, and he's correct.
2701400	2704840	Yeah. He's actually correct. But said in a much more assholist way,
2704840	2708680	like all the passive aggressiveness. Ashholist. Ash, Ashholist.
2709160	2709660	Yeah.
2713960	2714460	Go on.
2715240	2721160	But like said in like the most passive aggressive way, without actually being blunt,
2721160	2725400	like Dev just wasn't saying all that, you know? He was definitely being a dick towards them.
2725400	2728360	Cause he was like, he knew something was up though. He's not an idiot.
2728360	2735400	No. And, and, but also seven of nine hated his guts. That was the one thing I was just like, man.
2735400	2739320	And also I think that if you guys, if you guys end up watching, I hope you guys don't watch
2739320	2745240	season season, season three, episode one. But if you do, I actually think that the main reason
2745240	2755320	that she hates region, I can't fucking talk. Let it go. Let it go. Yes. I think the main reason
2755320	2760920	that she hates like the captain so much is that she shouldn't actually be a first officer.
2760920	2767080	She should just be the, uh, no, like the, like head science officer. Yeah. Because that's what
2767080	2772280	she was doing on a Voyager. She was an officer, but yeah. Yeah. But like, she was pretty much the
2772280	2776120	head science officer, but come on. And, but like, she was great and really good at that. But now
2776120	2780200	she's first officer and just hates her fucking job because she has to work immediately under
2780200	2783960	a cabinet. She doesn't really like, um, just like, okay, so go do science stuff. Cause that's what
2783960	2791160	made you happy. Yeah. You know, I don't know. Like it feels like it's just the whole thing of
2791160	2797400	her character being very different, but there being no lead up to her being very different.
2798120	2801880	So if you think about Voyager, it's like, well, that doesn't exist anymore.
2802920	2807960	So here's the thing to actually get along with it, with the story though. Uh, so the sweet talking
2807960	2811240	doesn't work. She doesn't work seven times. Like fuck it. And then they go there anyway.
2811240	2815000	And then the captain is like, you know what? You just fucked yourself out of your career.
2815000	2821720	And someone's like, yeah, I did. Um, Picard and Riker steal a shuttle. They fly out. They find
2821720	2829160	Beverly ship. They dock, um, Beverly's like, by the way, I have another son. No. Okay. Beverly
2829160	2835640	was unconscious in the ship and she was in a medical thing and this guy just randomly attacks
2835640	2842840	Will and Picard. And it turns out that it's Beverly's son who knows who the dad is. I have
2842840	2847400	a feeling it's probably Picard though. They didn't bang though. You sure? I'm pretty sure
2847400	2851560	it's going to be retcon that they did right before she left. Okay. But basically this kid is old
2851560	2856840	enough that he could be like 20 or 21, which means that they might've had it. It also could be the
2856840	2861560	case that she had the kid after they split up. I am 100% telling you right now that it's going to
2861560	2871160	be Picard's kid who, and part of the reason that she left is because they had like a, like a,
2871160	2876040	we're going to get back together, bang. And then they didn't and she left, but was pregnant. So
2876040	2879880	they're just doing the exact story that they did with Kirk. Yes. Where Kirk had like a random son
2879880	2884520	from like a scientist woman. 100% that's going to be. Do you think he's going to get killed like
2884520	2890760	Kirk's son did? Maybe. Is this the same story? Maybe. Okay. Here's the thing though. What's
2890760	2895480	really weird about it is that this kid has to be at least 20 years younger than Wesley.
2895480	2901320	Yeah. Yeah. Like that's a, that's a weird feeling. It's like, wow. Imagine like having a sibling
2901320	2905000	that is like 20 or 25 years older than you. Like, holy fuck. For a while I actually thought like,
2905000	2910600	is this just going to be Wesley with like, like de-aged? Do you go with like a de-aging machine
2910600	2914680	or did he like, did he get like, like plastic surgery done? He's like, no, it's probably a
2914680	2919080	new kid. It's probably a new kid. 100%. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I don't think Wesley would have
2919080	2922680	attacked Will like that. Though it would be good to see Wesley get bitch slapped.
2924280	2927960	Cause Will just fucking smacks him. You mean Will Wheaton get bitch slapped? Yes.
2929560	2934440	I like how whenever like Will Wheaton has a bad take on Twitter, people just spin him with,
2934440	2941480	shut up Wesley. It's really fucking funny. Yeah. That's pretty funny. Funny. Yeah.
2941480	2946680	Funnily. Funnily. Funnily funny. That's my name. Don't wear it out. But that's the end of the show
2946680	2954760	because not Will Wheaton. Not Wesley Crusher is like, Hey, by the way, guys look out the window
2954760	2958520	and they look out and it's like this giant fucking ship that's meant to be really intimidating. But
2958520	2963640	I'm like, listen, we've seen this with the scimitar and it was at nemesis or insurrection. We've seen
2963640	2968360	this with the, with the Romulan mining ship and the reboot. There's, there's been a lot of
2968360	2970840	Star Trek villain ships where they come out of the nub and it's like,
2970920	2979400	dah, dah, dah. And it's like a central pod with like a bunch of like spiky bits pointing forward
2979400	2984360	off the sides to make it look like it's yeah. Yeah. And it's like, okay, I get it. You're
2984360	2988120	trying to be intimidating, but we've seen this in Star Trek so many times now this exact fucking
2988120	2994600	ship. It's like, okay. Yep. Didn't matter. Yeah. So like clearly this episode that's the end of the
2994600	3001400	episode. Um, clearly the episode is meant to be, it's like a set up episode. We're not going to
3001400	3008760	get any of these questions answered right away. Um, and it feels like they were the, uh, for,
3008760	3011400	for this episode and the season, they're like, listen, we know we fucked up, dude,
3011400	3014680	can you please just give us another chance? And the reason it feels like that is because
3014680	3020920	one there's so many old lore call. Oh, wait, we forgot all about, uh, Raffi. Oh, that's right.
3021880	3027640	Raffi has a completely, completely unconnected story. Yep. So Raffi is like an undercover
3027640	3032760	officer somewhere, somewhere on some, on some like party planet. Cause every planet is just
3032760	3038200	like the party planet or the ice planet or the city planet or whatever the bad city planet,
3038200	3043080	the fire planet, where the bad Orion's hang out the desert planet. Yep. Yeah. So she's like
3043080	3048200	undercover. She gets information about an incoming terrorist attack. Yep. And she's like, what the
3048200	3052680	fuck does it mean, dude? And she's talking to like either an AI or a person with like a coded voice
3052680	3056200	or something. No, no. She's, she's talking to a secret handler. That's what they said. Yeah.
3056200	3059640	Cause she's part of Starfleet intelligence and Starfleet intelligence is like, doesn't want to
3059640	3063800	reveal who they are to her. The handler doesn't because it's like, it's undercover. Right. Yeah.
3064680	3068760	And Raffi is like, listen, dude, there's something, something big is going to happen. They, they,
3068760	3072760	they stole this experimental portal technology. It's literally portals from the game portal.
3072760	3075720	You open up two fucking portals. You can walk through it. It's like, that's what it is. All
3075720	3080280	right. But it's really big. And she like flies into it's not earth. It's like a different planet.
3080280	3083720	Yeah. And she flies, there's like a Federation like city on a different planet. And she flies
3083720	3087800	down and she's like, guys, there's like a Starfleet base there. And she's like, listen,
3087800	3091240	guys, you're going to get fucked. There's a terrorist attack incoming. I need to talk to
3091240	3096120	someone like several times the words I need to talk to someone right now, like no Starfleet
3096120	3100360	codes or anything. Just I'm screaming into the PA. I need to talk to someone. Because Raffi is
3100360	3105560	fucking incompetent. Yeah. Always has been. Yeah. And then, and then she watches like a portal open
3105560	3111160	up underneath the building and the entire building falls into the portal. Yeah. The portal opens
3111160	3116120	right above the building to the right. Yeah. It's like, it's like one city block over. Yeah. So it
3116120	3120920	doesn't even like, it's not even in another part of like the city, like somewhere like, especially
3120920	3127240	like, Oh God, there's, there's an orphanage here. No, it's just like, Oh, and here's the
3127240	3132040	building. And I was like, Oh, okay. And the building just like falls onto the street. Yeah.
3132040	3135560	And like, it's, it's clearly like a big fucking disaster. There's probably a lot of people who
3135560	3139560	died. There was a lot of screaming. Yeah. Yeah. But then, which is kind of funny because she's
3139560	3143160	like, how did Raffi hear that? She's in her ship. She's above the city. She's like watching this.
3143160	3147320	And you're also, even the camera's really far away from it. Like, but basically it was also,
3147320	3151960	what would be screaming? They're all like dead. Well, the people around the people who didn't get
3151960	3155480	squished. To be fair, I actually watched because I watched this episode twice, once on my own,
3155480	3159240	once with you. And I watched like the second time through, I watched all the little cars
3159240	3163560	driving around the city and like they did a decent job with detail because like cars that
3163560	3168840	were approaching the disaster stopped and like cars that were on the way away, like sped up.
3168840	3173880	I was like, they actually made it look like it was nice. Yeah. That was like their big
3173880	3179320	effect shot for the episode. Yeah. I do always appreciate when, uh, the, a show will go like
3179320	3183800	in depth and far away shots. Even, even if you don't notice them on a first watch, you notice
3183800	3186840	them, you'll notice them on like a second or third and be like, Oh, that's neat. Like I,
3187640	3193640	it does definitely boost points in the, how much do I like the show skill? Yeah. So this
3193640	3200760	Starfleet outpost or whatever is destroyed and Rafi's like, Oh my God. Didn't she just start
3200760	3205720	crying? Kind of. I don't remember. Kind of. Her reaction was very kind of blase. Well,
3205720	3209000	she's not a very good actress to be honest. She's, she's talked about everything the entire show.
3209000	3212920	No, listen, I actually think that the actress is pretty good. Oh yeah. It's just the character
3212920	3219080	was really bad. Oh, okay. No, no. I legit like she, cause she's done good because like she isn't
3219080	3224600	like, she isn't like a Kristen Stewart where like she just hasn't had any like facial changes or
3224600	3227480	anything. Apparently she's actually a good actress too. It's just the Twilight sucked.
3228440	3233400	No, because I saw her in, um, snow white. There, there was a snow white movie with
3233400	3237880	Kristen Stewart as snow white. Yeah. Like it was, it was like a snow white, like not a parody,
3237880	3242520	not cause of comedy, but like a shitty one. Sure. I don't even remember, but she was in that. I'm
3242520	3246920	like, she's just doing the same thing with her face. Okay. Apparently though she has a new movie,
3246920	3251160	I think about some, it has something to do with British royalty and she looks pretty good in that.
3251160	3255640	I saw different emotions on her face and I was like, Oh shit. For the first time she experienced
3255640	3261560	emotion. I'm sure she experienced most in other times, but like in, in the very few things I've
3261560	3266680	seen her in, I haven't really seen her face change very much. Right. But anyway, like it's not the
3267480	3271880	actress is not like doing that and she's not only just doing one thing, but she has different,
3271880	3278360	like she has very hammy. Well, yeah, but like the characters hammy, you know, like this character
3278360	3285400	is like a, like a semi crazed like drug addict who is not a drug addict at the moment, but at least
3285400	3289560	was, you know, and it has like, it's fucked up her family life. It's fucked up her work life,
3289560	3297880	like, and just like is very, very emotional person, emotional reacting person first.
3297880	3303640	But I actually thought that her reaction to the, like the disaster, the disaster was very,
3303640	3308200	just like, and tears because like she was just getting really frustrated with not being able
3308200	3313320	to figure out like what was happening. The issue with, with Rafi's story is that it's completely
3313320	3317800	disconnected and separate from the rest of the story. The moment it is, there's no crossover
3317800	3322440	scenes. There's definitely going to be, of course there's, but like the main cast doesn't even
3322440	3327080	mention Rafi. No one knows what she's doing. No one cares. Oh, you know what? I bet it is.
3327080	3331720	I bet that the aliens who were attacking Beverly's ship are also the ones who have that
3331720	3336760	portal technology. Yeah. That's going to be what the connection is. Yeah, probably. But anyway,
3339160	3347400	the episode itself, not very good, but at least not offensively bad. No. Yeah. It's not as bad
3347400	3352120	as Picard seasons one and two. And that's like high praise for this. That's why it's getting
3352520	3356280	such high marks on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, also because everyone's like,
3356280	3361480	Oh my God, everyone's back. Beverly crushers. Well, here's the thing. So they expelled all
3361480	3367000	the cast of season one and two. Except for Rafi, Seven of Nine and Rafi. And Rafi's in a new
3367000	3372520	character. What's her name? The housekeeper. Oh, Laris. Yeah, Laris and Laris. Those are the only
3372520	3375560	three we see. And I have a feeling that Laris is also going to be out for the season. She's not
3375560	3379400	going to show back up. No, of course she will. No. Me at the very end. Listen, she wasn't in
3379400	3384680	season two at all. She was a different character. Yeah, but they still had the actress. Yeah, I
3384680	3387880	know. But still it wasn't Laris. And in season one, she was there for half a season. Yeah,
3387880	3391640	but that's because she had to protect Picard. Yeah. For a little bit. And she wasn't there
3391640	3398120	that much. Just when he went back to the Chateau. She wasn't there that much. You're, I think. No,
3398120	3403800	no, no. Because Picard spent like before he was in the Chateau for like four out of 10 episodes
3403800	3411240	of season one. Yeah, well, that's because the robot girl, spoilers, you know, had to rest and
3411240	3415480	heal and not be attacked. No, I know. There was reasons for it. But no, Laris was around for a
3415480	3419320	good chunk of season one and she came back at the end of season one too. But no, here, let me, let
3419320	3426680	me, let me put it this way. Let me put it this way, okay? All the characters were so annoying
3426680	3432280	from season one and two. All the new characters. And they had, they basically had concluded all
3432280	3435960	of their stories, even though the conclusions were terrible and the stories were terrible.
3435960	3440840	They were done. So they just kicked all them out and they're like, fuck it. As I mentioned before,
3440840	3445960	they really wanted this to be like the worst story show. So they brought back all the regulars from
3445960	3451320	TNG as main story season. Yeah, it was still, it's still the worst story show of the season. But
3451320	3459800	anyway, they brought back all the regulars of TNG. So Worf's gonna be in it. And that, that,
3459800	3465160	that's already been announced. Yes. He's not in it yet. But we've seen Will and Beverly
3465160	3472760	Crusher, but Geordi's coming back. Worf's coming back. Deanna? Deanna Troi's coming back. Data's
3472760	3478040	dead, but apparently his actor is playing Lor. So Lor's coming back. Okay, one thing I want to
3478040	3485240	say about the Star Trek universe is that I love the fact that like Data and Lor and all of what's,
3485240	3489480	what's the scientist's name? The Soong family. Yeah, the Soong family is all just fucking played
3489800	3495240	by Brent Spiner. That's my favorite trope of Star Trek and it's great. Like even in season two,
3495240	3503320	Brent Spiner is like, like Asian ancestors, still Brent Spiner. Yeah. It's great. I love it. Yep.
3503320	3510120	But it's so stupid. But Lor's coming back because you got to have Brent Spiner in the show.
3510120	3514600	Apparently Tasha Yar's coming back. Okay, you told me she was dead. She is dead.
3515240	3519480	How? Maybe Picard hallucinates or something on his deathbed again. It's like 15th deathbed.
3519800	3525480	Who knows? Not Tasha Yar. Tasha Yar is dead. I meant the actress. The actress is dead,
3525480	3530280	according to Dev. No, you told me. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. You told me the actress was dead.
3530280	3534120	100%. I said the character was dead. No, you told me the actress was also dead.
3534120	3538920	Because she was the one that turned to like drug use and such, right? No, no, no, no, no, no.
3538920	3543960	That was Kesa's actress from Voyager. She's not dead though. She's like a drug-addled freak
3543960	3547560	living in like Ohio or like fucking Wyoming or something. They're both white and blonde,
3547640	3553160	mixed it up. Oh, white blonde and short hair? Yeah. No, man. Dude, Kesa's actress. Oh,
3553160	3556760	fuck. Like you've seen those pictures, right? Okay, no. She's like, she's like running around
3556760	3561240	like a fucking crack shack, exposing herself, like exposing her naked body of children
3561240	3565960	on the street. She's like driving while like fucking heroin'd up. Like she, she's fucked.
3565960	3570760	Yeah. She, she was like, yeah, you know, I, I had a few problems like back in 2012. She was like,
3570760	3573000	I had a few problems. I got my life turned around. I'm gonna go back to school for like
3573000	3578600	culinary arts. Nope. She just, she's, she's just, she's just fucking meth. That's all she is now.
3578600	3583160	She's just meth. She's a person of meth. Okay. No, I thought Tasha Yara's actress was dead.
3583160	3587480	Nope. Okay. Denise Crosby's still alive. That makes more sense then. Yeah.
3587480	3591480	There's going to be either time travel, shenanigans or hallucinations then.
3591480	3595000	Yeah. And I have a feeling it might be hallucinations this time because they already
3595000	3600760	did the time travel. Yeah. So it's probably hallucinations. Or maybe they'll like bring
3600760	3604600	back the actress, actress, but have her play that half Romulan child that she had.
3605240	3609400	Oh, maybe. That might be it. Is there anyone else they're getting from TNG to come back?
3609400	3615160	I think some side characters. Oh, we're on the Wikipedia right now. Jack Crusher is coming back.
3615880	3620040	Who's Jack? Oh, that's the kid. That's the spoiler.
3620040	3623160	Oh, I thought it was, well, wasn't, wasn't her husband named Jack Crusher?
3624040	3626280	Pretty sure he was not. Is this Jack Crusher Jr.?
3626280	3630200	Oh yeah. They're adding a couple of the Forge kids.
3630200	3631240	Which is great.
3631240	3636680	Yep. Oh, and they're bringing back Professor Moriarty. The holodeck guy.
3636680	3637480	Oh my God.
3637480	3639000	They got him back for some reason.
3640520	3642600	It's going to be bad, but I'm excited, but it's going to be bad.
3642600	3650280	It is going to be bad. Like he's supposed to be, I guess, a villain in this. Why? Okay.
3650280	3654280	No, he might just be there to like help them out because he was just stuck in the holodeck,
3654280	3656760	remember? Like, but they saved his program because he was alive.
3656760	3657560	Yeah. Yeah.
3657560	3658440	Because, yeah.
3659240	3663560	Instead of letting him be like the doctor on Voyager, they just, yeah.
3663560	3671480	Well, they didn't have, they didn't have, what are they called? Portable, portable emitters.
3671480	3672920	Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah.
3673720	3675160	Mobile emitter is what they called it.
3675160	3675640	Yep.
3675640	3676440	They didn't have that.
3676440	3679720	There's not much to say about season three, episode one, because it's...
3679720	3680440	It's just the setup.
3680440	3681080	It's just the setup.
3681080	3681480	But like...
3681480	3683800	This is why we probably should have waited to do this video.
3683800	3687560	No. Well, here's the... I didn't have anything else ready for today. So this is my filler.
3687560	3691960	See, I want to point out that I said that Dev is lazy with his work at the beginning of this.
3691960	3694520	Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here.
3698360	3700280	I am excited to see Geordi, though.
3700280	3700760	Yeah.
3700760	3701160	I'll say that.
3701160	3703080	Apparently the visor's gone. He has eyes now.
3703720	3705720	Yeah, but there was always an option for him, Dev.
3705720	3709160	It was, but remember he said, I don't want them. I like the visor.
3709160	3712760	He said that he made it a part of his identity that he didn't want to get real eyes.
3712760	3713800	Then he got real eyes.
3713800	3719080	Okay. I do want to point out that that one is slightly more okay. Only, only...
3719080	3722840	No. They're erasing blind representation. It's bigoted.
3722840	3729480	Fine. Only because he mentioned that the visor gives him headaches every single day.
3729480	3730040	Yeah.
3730040	3736360	Yeah. If I'm an old person, I'm already in pain. I don't want the additional pain of headaches.
3736360	3738840	If I can get rid of it. So...
3739560	3740520	Yeah, I guess.
3740520	3744440	And also it's like way in the future. It's probably just visor eyes.
3745080	3745880	That's what they are, yeah.
3745880	3747320	Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm saying.
3748200	3750200	Why wouldn't you give everyone visor eyes, though?
3750200	3753560	Because not everyone's comfortable with taking their eyes out.
3753560	3755000	Yeah, I guess, but they're better.
3755000	3757480	This is not cyberpunk. This doesn't happen that often.
3757480	3763880	Yeah. I think there's an idea that, in Trek at least, there's this idea that the reason
3763880	3767800	humans don't augment their body all the time, even though they could, is because they're...
3767800	3768600	It's partially illegal.
3769240	3773560	No, no, it's not. Because they gave Nog a fake leg after the Dominion War.
3773560	3776520	Yeah, because he lost his actual leg.
3776520	3782120	But here's the thing. They basically say, we don't feel this need anymore to constantly
3782120	3786040	improve ourselves. We're comfortable the way that we are. And they play it off as some sort
3786040	3790840	of maturity, where humanity has grown up. They're not vain anymore. They're not greedy anymore.
3790840	3794680	So they don't feel the need to replace their body with robot parts all the time.
3795560	3798200	They're comfortable in their own skin, and they only do it if they have to.
3798760	3805240	So it's almost like a moral component of their society, that they're not doing the cyberpunk
3805240	3805960	thing.
3805960	3809720	Yeah, I think... I have a feeling that their morality is probably based around plastic
3809720	3811000	surgery. You know?
3812040	3818760	Well, yeah, because we're, at the moment, in real life, society is not at the level
3818760	3824680	of being able to comfortably replace body parts with much more functional...
3825640	3826680	We'll get there eventually, I think.
3826680	3829640	No, no, we definitely will, because we're getting pretty close. But the thing is, there's
3829640	3834520	also phantom pain and stuff, and you'd have to get past that part first. There's extra
3834520	3838760	stuff. We're getting close. We're not there yet, though. So since we're not there yet,
3838760	3844760	the only closest thing that you could associate actual morality to when it comes to cyberpunk
3844760	3851080	like stuff, like the whole replacing your body with robot parts, is plastic surgery
3851080	3855880	for vaneness. Because generally, people who are not getting plastic surgery for a specific
3855880	3860280	medical reason, just to look better, are technically being vain. I am not against plastic
3860280	3862120	surgery, by the way. I'm not.
3862120	3864760	You like giant Brazilian butts right in your face?
3864760	3867720	Sure, why not? I'm attracted to Kim Kardashian, I'll say it.
3868360	3869000	Jesus Christ.
3869000	3869480	Yeah.
3869480	3870440	I'm done with you.
3870440	3875160	Yeah, but like, I'm not against plastic surgery for people who want to do that. But I think
3875160	3880200	that if we're just like, especially in the 50s or 60s or whatever, like for the old show,
3880840	3886280	no one's augmenting anything. You could only really relate that back to probably plastic surgery.
3886280	3886840	Maybe, yeah.
3886840	3892280	Yeah. Of course, I don't know how good plastic surgery was in the 50s to make this comparison.
3892280	3896680	So maybe I'm just totally fucking wrong. I don't fucking know. But I'm just saying,
3897400	3902360	it probably stems from that. And then, you know, cyberpunk is slightly more newish thing.
3903320	3903800	Well, in terms of-
3903800	3905400	More mainstream newish thing.
3905400	3906680	In terms of Picard, though.
3906680	3907160	Yeah.
3907160	3908280	It's not a good show.
3908280	3908440	No.
3908440	3909480	I wouldn't recommend anyone watch it.
3909480	3910440	Nobody should watch it.
3913400	3918520	There's nothing really like good about it, frankly. I didn't enjoy watching it. I didn't,
3918520	3924920	I don't think that like, there's lower callbacks, but it's cheap. It feels cheap. Everything does
3924920	3933960	not, nothing in the show is good. The only plus that I can give this show is that it's not Picard
3933960	3939160	seasons one and two. That's it. It's still a bad show. Everything's still negative. I still
3939160	3940520	wouldn't watch it if I was on my own.
3940520	3945400	No. I would not have missed anything in my life if I'd never watched this.
3945400	3950440	I have heard some people say that they did the reset button on season three so cleanly
3951000	3956200	that if you just went from like Nemesis and Insurrection to Picard season three,
3956200	3956920	You wouldn't have missed anything.
3956920	3962920	You wouldn't miss anything because nothing that happens in seasons one and two really matter that
3963000	3970440	Which is a really bad episode. Like that's a such a bad show. Take like, Oh yeah,
3970440	3974760	you're going to skip the first two seasons of the show and it won't have been anything. It's fine.
3974760	3976360	I'm just like, wow, that's just sad.
3976360	3979800	Cause none of the lore stuck. None of the characters stuck around except for Raffi.
3982040	3987720	Her character can just be explained away by, Oh, she's an intelligence. Obviously has it like,
3987720	3989080	obviously was a drug addict.
3989080	3990840	Yeah. Cause she drops the drugs in the scene.
3991640	3994760	There's there's, you know what I'll say for that moment of,
3994760	3998520	since I'm watching house currently, I'm binge watching, watching Dr. House.
4000040	4004440	They did the, her like looking at the drugs and like dropping them. And like, I think she was,
4005000	4009240	was she still holding drugs in the ship? No.
4009240	4012120	No. Okay. So she dropped the drugs that she definitely kind of wanted to take.
4012120	4015320	And they did that moment very well. I enjoy that. I was like, is she going to do it?
4015320	4018280	Cause I wasn't sure. Cause like with lots of Picard,
4018280	4021080	as soon as a character encounters a crossroads like that,
4021080	4023800	I can almost instantly be like, they're going to do that. And then they do.
4023800	4026760	And I'm always right. Which is like, I'm not smart. So this is like,
4026760	4032920	that's a really bad sign of a show that I can just immediately tell what a character is going to do
4032920	4035240	when they come to a crossroads and they don't surprise me.
4036040	4039560	You know, but they did that moment very well. Like she definitely, she dropped it,
4039560	4044600	but it was a very uncertain moment. So I th I think they might do that storyline a bit
4045160	4049080	better than what they currently were doing. Cause in season two, it wasn't an issue at all.
4049960	4052600	I think she was over it. Yeah. Yeah. But now she's not.
4053400	4058600	Whatever. Yeah. So that's bad. But if you forget about season two, that is fine.
4059240	4062760	You can forget about season one. You can forget about the entire show.
4062760	4065960	Yeah. Well, no, actually, cause. If you forget that all of Picard
4066600	4069880	existed, your life will probably be better. Your life will be better. Yeah, definitely.
4069880	4077480	Yeah. So I guess that's, that's what happened in season, in season three, episode one. It's,
4078120	4085240	it's still not good. I'm still not enjoying watching the show, but it's not, it's not.
4085800	4091400	I'm now enjoying it. Yeah, no, I, I legitimately have been so scarred by season one and two of
4091400	4099080	Picard that like my bad, like levels of is media bad or actually ruined. Anything that is not as
4099080	4103160	bad as season two, Picard and was like, it's good. I can watch this. It's great. Like, like,
4103160	4109240	like with Velma. Yeah. I can watch this. It's fine. I have been ruined and it's your fault.
4109240	4112920	Oh, it's my fault. Yes. You made me watch it. I would not have watched it otherwise.
4112920	4118280	I'd have watched a couple, a few episodes of Picard season one and been like, fuck this show.
4118280	4121560	I hate everything. I don't want to watch star Trek stuff for a while now.
4123000	4126680	No, because of you, I've been ruined and you've been kind of ruined too.
4127000	4133000	And it's all your fault. It's all your fault for making me watch it.
4133000	4136040	That's okay. We're going to get a good video out of it one day.
4136680	4140600	No, you'll get a good video. I will just be ruined with nothing to show for it.
4140600	4141480	I'll put you into the video.
4143640	4147800	Don't watch Picard. Don't do it. It's bad.
