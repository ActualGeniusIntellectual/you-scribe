1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
Good morning, everyone. Dev and Naomi are back together again. We broke up for a while, but...

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,180
They're gonna actually believe that, you know.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,780
What I mean... What I mean by this is we haven't done a Dev and Naomi talks about

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,920
TV or movie or whatever since I think... How was the dragon?

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,420
Was it?

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:21,920
It was because you're lazy.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,420
Because you're lazy, too.

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,320
I am lazy in my own way.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,320
Well, you can't even complain!

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,720
No, no, you're lazy when it comes to your work.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,720
Listen, okay? That's not true and you know it.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,720
Yes, it is.

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,720
That's what you get.

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,720
Stop.

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,720
So we have our morning coffees. It's reasonably in the morning for us and uh...

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,720
Yeah, okay.

17
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,320
We have our coffees and we're gonna be here to talk about Star Trek Picard season 3.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Episode 1!

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,720
Okay, so here. Let me give you the TLDR, alright?

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,720
When I first met Naomi, she didn't know what Star Trek was.

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Yep.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,720
And I was like, you know what? I think you'd actually like it. Even though it's not like...

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,720
You thought before me it was like just another generic sci-fi action series, right?

24
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,720
Yeah, because hashtag Star Wars was always bad.

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
How is that related?

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,720
Because that's another generic sci-fi series that was, you know, really popular that I didn't know that much about.

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,720
You're getting more beatings for that. Here they are. Here they are.

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Ow.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,120
Okay, so listen.

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,120
But Star Trek is not a generic sci-fi action series. It has action.

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,120
But it's also like, it's kind of comedic, it's kind of dramatic.

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,120
But it's like a procedural, you know?

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,120
Yeah.

34
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,120
And it's a very good procedural.

35
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,120
And it probably... it basically started the genre of what it is.

36
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,120
It's like...

37
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
Wait, what other shows are like Star Trek?

38
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,120
That are not Star Trek related?

39
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,520
Like other Star Trek shows?

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
And The Orville doesn't count.

41
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Because it's a Star Trek parody, right?

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Yeah. The Orville doesn't count.

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
I guess it is kind of something...

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,520
Well, here's the thing. If you go back really far, like before Star Trek, you can find stuff like Flash Gordon.

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Which is very much... which is very similar.

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,520
But it's like... it was that way because that was like a black and white convention.

47
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,520
And they couldn't really do what they could do with tech.

48
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,520
But with Star Trek...

49
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,520
I don't know, like there's one... like firstly, Star Trek was always like an optimistic series.

50
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Yeah, definitely.

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
It was never like the grim dark future.

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
It was always like...

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,920
You know, yeah, humanity had some bad spots and you can see some of the bad spots in Star Trek.

54
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,920
But you pulled through it and now things are like better.

55
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
It's like... it's a bright future overall.

56
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,920
And secondly, it was always about the characters and their relationships.

57
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,920
And they were always mature.

58
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,920
They never pulled punches.

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,920
The episode that comes to mind, now that I'm thinking about it,

60
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,320
is that one episode where Worf is asked to donate blood to a Romulan.

61
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
Of TNG, you should say.

62
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,320
Yeah, and he... and you know, Worf hates Romulans.

63
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
Yeah.

64
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Because he's being racist.

65
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
He has a reason, but still.

66
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Yeah, he has a...

67
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,320
I don't know, like if you know a race... like a specific race kills your entire family, spoilers.

68
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,320
You're a racist, Naomi.

69
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Naomi's a racist.

70
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
Then you get to be a little bit racist.

71
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Just a little.

72
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Here's the thing.

73
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,720
You know, a show... another show, especially another show nowadays,

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,720
would resolve the moral dilemma by having like a third option.

75
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Like just give you an easy way out.

76
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
But TNG didn't.

77
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,720
TNG said, listen, either you let Worf be racist and let this Romulan die

78
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,720
or you violate his rights and make him donate the blood.

79
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,720
And the show doesn't pull that punch.

80
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,720
It allows Worf to be racist and the Romulan dies

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
and then there's actually a consequence to it.

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,120
And it's like, OK, so...

83
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:53,120
It's nice because you get... it's more realistic than having that magical third option.

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Because oftentimes in real life, you don't get the magical third option.

85
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
You get two shitty options and that's all you get.

86
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Sometimes there's only one shitty option, but that's the conversation.

87
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
Yes.

88
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:09,120
But that was what made TNG... like all of Star Trek, but TNG especially special to me.

89
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Yeah.

90
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,520
And there weren't like fucking Marvel style quips 24-7.

91
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,520
It didn't mind being a bit grimy and edgy when it had to be,

92
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,520
but that wasn't like... humans were kind of past that.

93
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,520
That wasn't the theme of any of the shows in the Star Trek universe.

94
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Even the darkest show, Deep Space Nine, still had that thread of optimism going through it.

95
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Because when we encounter the darker sections of Starfleet, like section 31,

96
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,920
our heroes are rightly disgusted by what they do.

97
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
So there's...

98
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,920
It basically... it provided like this sense of liberal optimism towards the future

99
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,920
and about how humanity is going to turn out.

100
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,920
It's not going to be perfect, it's not going to be Utopia,

101
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,920
but basically the idea that it's not going to be a fucking cyberpunk grimdark hellhole

102
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,320
where everything sucks.

103
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,320
However, after 9-11, that type of science fiction became way more...

104
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,320
it was already popular in the 80s, but it became way more popular after 9-11.

105
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,320
And they tried to like make... they tried to like update Star Trek in that way,

106
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,320
so like they did the whole like an enterprise, like the Xindi attacking Earth

107
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,320
and that didn't help the show, it still got cancelled.

108
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,320
They tried to like make it just a straight action movie with the J.J. Abrams reboot

109
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,720
and I think... like those were okay movies, but they weren't really Star Trek movies.

110
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Yeah, after... like I really enjoyed those movies before I knew anything about Star Trek

111
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,720
because of course I saw those first, because I didn't watch old things before you, because you know...

112
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Because you're a fucking Zoomer, I know.

113
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Yeah, totally.

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
But they were... they were really good.

115
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,720
I really enjoyed watching them, but then after watching Star Trek, I'm just like...

116
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Oh.

117
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Yeah, that's not what they were supposed to be.

118
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Oh.

119
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
The reason... okay, I know, here's like what Picard sees in 3 episode 1.

120
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,120
The reason I'm doing all this is because... I'm describing all this because Naomi didn't know

121
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,120
what Star Trek was really before she met me.

122
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,120
And maybe some of you watching still don't know what Star Trek is, and that's okay.

123
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
No, it's not.

124
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
You should watch it.

125
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,120
But no, we sat down, over the course of like the first half of our relationship,

126
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,120
we sat down and watched every single Star Trek.

127
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Yeah, everything.

128
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
We started chronologically.

129
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
Yes, we started with the original series.

130
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Which was surprisingly good.

131
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
For the time.

132
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
You have to remember that it was a 50s show?

133
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
60s show.

134
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
I think it was a 60s show.

135
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
I don't remember.

136
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
I think it was like 1969?

137
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,520
So once you go into the mindset of this is a really old show and it's not gonna be perfect,

138
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,520
but it's still gonna, you know, it's still gonna be Star Trek, it's great.

139
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,520
Yes.

140
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
Then we watched the animated series.

141
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Yeah.

142
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Which was just kind of goofy.

143
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
Yeah, that was goofy, but also a product of its time.

144
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,520
Yeah.

145
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
Yeah.

146
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
It's like watching Scooby-Doo again.

147
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
Yep.

148
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Then we watched TNG.

149
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,520
But here's the thing, we watched them in order of release.

150
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,920
So back in the day, TNG, DS9, and Voyager all came out at the same time, like overlapping.

151
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Yeah.

152
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
So we actually watched the episodes overlapping the way they came out.

153
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Yeah.

154
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Because I had never done that before.

155
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
That was a fun experience.

156
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Yeah, that was interesting.

157
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Yeah.

158
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Yeah.

159
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
Going back and forth between like different casts and having to keep them all in our heads.

160
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Well, yeah, but also like being able to like get the story slightly better than being like,

161
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,520
instead of instead of like watching like...

162
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
There was crossovers between.

163
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,920
Yeah, because there was crossovers like in later seasons and instead of being able to

164
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,320
like watching an entire series and watching the next one and being like, oh, who was that

165
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
person?

166
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Why is this crossover relevant?

167
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Yeah.

168
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
You actually...

169
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
You got it.

170
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
...understand why it's relevant.

171
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Yeah.

172
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,320
I know Julian Bashir from DS9 was guest starring on TNG for one episode.

173
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
Was he?

174
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
Yep.

175
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
He was like doing...

176
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
I remember it on Data.

177
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Oh.

178
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
Yeah.

179
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
I don't remember that.

180
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
It was like in season six or something.

181
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
I don't remember this.

182
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,320
I remember when Will came to DS9 for like a day.

183
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Will?

184
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Riker.

185
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Oh, but it was actually Thomas Riker?

186
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Oh, yeah.

187
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
That's right.

188
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Yeah.

189
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
It was the duplicate.

190
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
But then also...

191
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Spoilers.

192
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Spoilers.

193
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,720
The guy who made the EMH in Voyager came to DS9 for a day too.

194
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
It's been too long.

195
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,520
I have to watch them all again, so I fully remember all these references.

196
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
Yeah.

197
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
We haven't watched DS9 in like three or four years.

198
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Yeah.

199
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
It's been a while.

200
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Yeah.

201
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
Jesus.

202
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
It's because we keep watching new bad Trek.

203
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,520
So the idea was we were going to go through the entire Star Trek canon in order of release.

204
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,600
So we go through all the shows, you go through Enterprise, and then I'm like, okay, Naomi,

205
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
here's...

206
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
We also watched the movies as well.

207
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Yeah.

208
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
We did watch the movies.

209
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
Like all the various like TNG movies, original series movies.

210
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Yeah.

211
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,000
Then we get to the reboots, we watch the reboots, and they're like, well, they're not very good.

212
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But they're okay.

213
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,560
And I'm like, okay, Naomi, here's where it gets bad.

214
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,240
Now we're gonna start watching Discovery.

215
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
And Naomi's like...

216
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
And here's the thing, okay?

217
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,640
It's like Discovery season one, like, there was a skeleton of a decent show, but they

218
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,600
needed to do it completely differently, and they just didn't do it.

219
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Also the Klingons.

220
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Yeah.

221
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
In the beginning.

222
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
That was bad.

223
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
The Trump Klingons.

224
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:56,880
But like there was... if you just told me a bare bones synopsis of Star Trek Discovery

225
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,760
season one, I'd be like, that could be good, but it wasn't because they did everything

226
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
wrong.

227
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Yeah.

228
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
But also...

229
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Same with season two, actually.

230
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Season two was better than season one, in fact.

231
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Yeah.

232
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,440
But Discovery is a good science fiction show.

233
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,240
It's not a good Star Trek show.

234
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
Not a Star Trek show.

235
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,440
Like it's better now in the later seasons where we're actually...

236
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
In the future.

237
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,440
In the future, like attempting to re... spoilers.

238
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Attempting to rebuild...

239
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Civilization?

240
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Because it all fell apart?

241
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
No.

242
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Well, not civilization, but rebuild the...

243
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Well, I've forgotten all of my words.

244
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
The Federation?

245
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Thank you.

246
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Jesus Christ.

247
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Yes, it is early in the morning for Naomi.

248
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Holy fuck.

249
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Drink some more of that coffee over there.

250
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Why don't you?

251
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
I'm going.

252
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
I've already half done.

253
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
It's not helping.

254
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Okay.

255
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,280
So Star Trek Discovery season one was not very good.

256
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:45,040
Star Trek Discovery season two was better, but I think it was just... looking back on

257
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
that.

258
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,800
I think it was just for the fan service because you had Captain Pike, you had Spock.

259
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
You know, just having...

260
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
You had number one come back.

261
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Yeah.

262
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
You know, I think...

263
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
And you had the Enterprise.

264
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
The original Enterprise.

265
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Yeah.

266
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
I think it was all just fan service for season two.

267
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,440
Season three was like...

268
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
That's when we went to the future?

269
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Yeah.

270
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
They went to the future.

271
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Right.

272
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
Yes.

273
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,440
That's where it started getting better.

274
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Yeah.

275
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
Yeah.

276
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
And season three and season four are now like...

277
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
mediocre.

278
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:17,080
It's about as good as like a slightly bad episode of Voyager, which is still pretty

279
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,880
bad, but it's better than it has been.

280
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,160
No, I don't know.

281
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,720
I think they're on par with like a mediocre episode of Voyager.

282
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,080
You know, like not a specifically bad episode, but like a mediocre episode, you know?

283
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
Yeah.

284
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
Okay.

285
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
Like, yeah, I watched it and it was, you know, it was okay.

286
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
You know.

287
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,200
You know, we watched Lower Decks, which is just a comedy show and it's funny for a comedy

288
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
show.

289
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
Yeah.

290
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,840
Lower Decks is like actually pretty good, but it's like... it's a comedy show.

291
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,840
It's strictly comedy.

292
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
Yeah.

293
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,840
And you have to know all the Star Trek references.

294
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,080
You're like, oh, Tom Parrish was up in this episode.

295
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
Yeah.

296
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,600
Like you have to have seen all of Star Trek to get it, but for what it is, it's good.

297
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Yeah.

298
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I really enjoy Lower Decks.

299
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Yeah.

300
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,800
If you haven't seen all of Star Trek, you're not gonna really like it that much.

301
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
No.

302
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,720
And like, it's very specifically like, yes, this is part of the Star Trek universe, but

303
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,240
it's also like, here's a shit ton of fan service and like just goof about the Star Trek universe.

304
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
Yeah.

305
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
But it's good.

306
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,240
I enjoyed it.

307
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,920
And of course, we mentioned the Orville briefly because the Orville is literally just TNG

308
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
again.

309
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
And I can kind of enjoy that.

310
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Yeah.

311
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
I mean, I will say I do.

312
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,520
Okay, guys, I really, really like the Orville and this is probably going to be shown as

313
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,920
a bad take, at least according to things I've seen online.

314
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Yeah.

315
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Yeah.

316
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:26,360
But I, in the latest season of the Orville, I miss the comedy that was in season one.

317
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Yeah.

318
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,520
Season three, like I think Seth MacFarlane was like, I can do a real show now.

319
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
It's like, no, it's supposed to be a comedy.

320
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
It's a parody.

321
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
You gotta chill the fuck out.

322
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
It's a parody.

323
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
But he wanted to try and make it like a real show.

324
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,280
The thing is, I still like it, but I actually really miss all the comedy in season one because

325
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,560
now it just feels like a generic Star Trek adjacent.

326
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
You know?

327
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,040
I'm not saying it's a bad show.

328
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,080
I just, I felt like it was more unique when it was more, not like, yeah, it was a parody,

329
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:03,480
but it didn't specifically mention Star Trek things, but it was a unique, this is obviously

330
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,200
a Star Trek reference show.

331
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
They can't see you with your hands.

332
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
I don't care.

333
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
This is for me.

334
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Naomi is dressing with her hands right now.

335
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,520
It's for me to help me focus, goddammit.

336
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Okay, tell me about it.

337
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,480
It didn't specifically comment that it was a Star Trek show.

338
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
You know?

339
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,760
It just like, if you've seen Star Trek and you watch the show, you're just like, oh yeah,

340
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,520
this is kind of like Star Trek, but with a lot more comedy.

341
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,960
And I felt that it was, it was very unique for, but now in the latest season, I'm just

342
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,780
like, this is mildly boring and I'm not laughing as nearly as much as I did, you know?

343
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,120
But it's still a good show.

344
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,760
I just miss what it was, but I understand wanting to move on from that.

345
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,760
I just wish-

346
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Yeah, they shouldn't have.

347
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
They shouldn't have.

348
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,760
I just wish they didn't.

349
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
That's just my personal opinion.

350
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,760
I'm sure a lot of the commenters aren't going to like it, but that's okay.

351
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,120
No, I'm pretty sure that I'll actually agree with you if they have a brain.

352
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,740
So listen, listen, to quickly go through this then, because we're getting bogged down.

353
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,840
We watched Star Trek Prodigy, which is the kid's show.

354
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
It's good for a kid's show.

355
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
It's written for children.

356
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
It's a children's show.

357
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,960
If you like Star Trek and you don't like shows written for children, don't watch it.

358
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Yeah.

359
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
But you know what?

360
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,820
It's basically set up so that if you're a parent and you're a longtime Trek fan and

361
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,280
you want to get your kids into Star Trek, what you could do is you could sit down, watch

362
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,380
this with your kids.

363
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,920
They're going to enjoy it as a kid's show and you're going to enjoy all the, all the

364
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,780
lore references because Janeway comes back, Chakotay comes back.

365
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,780
They have like-

366
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,780
Comes back.

367
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,780
Spoilers.

368
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,940
The Cindy's show up for a little bit, you know, the, the Tellarites show up for a little

369
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,940
bit.

370
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,940
Yeah.

371
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,220
There's, there's a bunch of lore that's built into the show.

372
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,460
And there's a lot more aliens, so that's neat.

373
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,460
Yeah.

374
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,460
Yeah.

375
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,020
We watched Strange New Worlds.

376
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,540
That was the, the Christopher Pike box show.

377
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,540
It's so good.

378
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,540
It's okay.

379
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,860
Well, there's still some serious problems with it.

380
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,860
Okay.

381
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,860
I don't care.

382
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,860
You know what?

383
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,860
After watching Picard.

384
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,860
Okay.

385
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,860
So it's such a good show.

386
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:02,420
Strange New Worlds is, it is actually kind of a delight just because it is Trek again.

387
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,620
Now it still has the Marvel quips that I'm kind of getting tired of at this point and

388
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:15,780
being in fucking everything, but they had self-contained one episode stories, you know,

389
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,340
they had like their villains of the week.

390
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,420
They had their going around, going to different plants, having adventures.

391
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,280
They structured it like an actual Star Trek show.

392
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,040
You have characters that we know like Christopher Pike and Spock and number one, Christopher

393
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Pike.

394
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,280
The actor is way too hot.

395
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,800
Listen, you were also into Spock when we first met.

396
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Remember?

397
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Yeah.

398
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
You just like all of them.

399
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
You fucking, you Horno.

400
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Yeah.

401
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
You like all the girls too, I bet.

402
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Yeah.

403
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Do you like Ortega?

404
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,080
The girl with like the short hair on the sides?

405
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Probably.

406
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Yeah.

407
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Honestly.

408
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,520
I don't remember anyone's name is anymore from anything.

409
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,760
I know that you like the fucking blue GF girl from Lower Decks.

410
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
Yeah.

411
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Because you just want a blue girl.

412
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Yeah.

413
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,040
Blue is my favorite color.

414
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,760
How can I not want a girl who's blue?

415
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,760
I'll take the man who's blue too.

416
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Yeah.

417
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Oh, the one that was blind?

418
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
Well, no.

419
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
I mean, just a blue man.

420
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Oh, you're ableist.

421
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
Oh my God, Naomi.

422
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,920
Ableist and racist because he was an Aenar, so all of his race is blind.

423
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
It's part of his race.

424
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,180
I can't fucking believe you, Naomi.

425
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,800
How terrible of a person are you?

426
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Wasn't he Andorian?

427
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,840
He was just a sub race of the Andorians?

428
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Yeah, the Aenar are all blind.

429
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,840
That's not being racist.

430
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,340
Listen, if a quality of your race is that you can't see and then you're like, I don't

431
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,840
like people who can't see, you're being racist towards them.

432
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
I didn't say I don't like people who can't see.

433
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,840
I just said I don't want to date someone who can't see.

434
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Naomi.

435
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Oh, wow.

436
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
Listen, if you wouldn't-

437
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Fine.

438
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
You know what?

439
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
If you go blind, I'm dumping you.

440
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
In 2023, if you wouldn't date a trans woman, you're a transphobics.

441
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,400
Therefore, if you wouldn't date a blind person, you're blindphobic.

442
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
That's how it works.

443
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Fine.

444
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If you wouldn't date a Muslim, you're Islamophobic, too.

445
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Okay.

446
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Fine.

447
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're just like, gigachad, yes.

448
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Fine.

449
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll take it.

450
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay.

451
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Fine.

452
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,360
But anyway, Strange New Worlds, good show, as close to as close to old Star Trek as Ugan.

453
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Yeah.

454
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
And enjoyable.

455
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
After Discovery.

456
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Yeah.

457
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,800
So basically, in Discovery season two, the main cast goes off to the future.

458
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,480
The side cast stays behind.

459
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,440
And then season one of Strange New Worlds continues with the side cast story with Pike

460
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
and Spock.

461
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,440
Yes.

462
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Because they are the side cast of Discovery season two.

463
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
Yes.

464
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,160
So basically, all the new Star Trek shows have never really hit the heights of good

465
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,760
TNG or good DS9.

466
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,960
They've never gotten there.

467
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,960
But-

468
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Strange New Worlds is the closest.

469
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
It's the closest.

470
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,720
And Strange New Worlds is as good as, in my opinion, an average episode of TNG.

471
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,240
Yeah, which is really good.

472
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Which is still pretty good.

473
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:55,760
You know, Discovery is now like a mediocre episode of Voyager, which is not as good.

474
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,840
It's watchable, but it's not as good.

475
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,960
And then the other shows are all like gimmicks, because the kid show, the cartoon show, you

476
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
know.

477
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Then you have Picard.

478
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,080
And then you have Picard.

479
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,640
We finally got there, like 20 minutes or whatever later.

480
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
Okay.

481
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Well, you know what?

482
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
The Star Trek universe is a large-

483
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
It's large.

484
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,080
Because-

485
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,500
Da da da da da da da da.

486
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Okay.

487
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Da da da da da da.

488
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:30,160
So, they set up in Discovery season three, a storyline where Empress Georgiou goes back

489
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,620
in time.

490
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,220
Do you recall?

491
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,220
Yes.

492
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,400
And she leaves the show.

493
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,480
And that's supposed to be the setup for a section 31 show because she's going to be

494
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
the star of it.

495
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Yeah.

496
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:47,000
So far that hasn't happened yet. And the reason that it hasn't happened is because Paramount only,

497
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:53,080
they set aside a budget for five shows at once. They're only making five Star Trek shows at once.

498
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:00,040
And the Christopher Pike and Spock, like first of all, all their shows have fucking failed and

499
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:06,760
sucked. But fans loved Pike and Spock so much in Discovery Season Two, they were like, everyone

500
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,520
on the internet was like, give these guys their own show, make a show, make a show, make a show,

501
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,680
and they're like, oh my god, everything about our show suck. No one likes anything,

502
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,960
we have to do something. And then I'm sure someone at Paramount was like, okay, fucking

503
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,440
this is the only thing anyone likes, make this show. So they're like, okay, if we're making

504
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,520
Strange New Worlds, we've got to preempt a show. What are we doing? We can't preempt Discovery,

505
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,440
it's the flagship. We can't preempt Picard, because we just spent like a billion dollars

506
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,160
getting Patrick Stewart back. So I guess we'll just cancel the section 31 one.

507
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,280
So basically, what they did was until Picard is done, because they only have Patrick Stewart for

508
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:48,120
three seasons. They shelved section 31. That show's not happening till Picard is done. And then it

509
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,120
will take the Picard slot. So instead of what might be an okay show in section, we don't know,

510
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,880
we don't know. Georgiou is fucking baller. Yeah, she's pretty fun. She's a badass bitch and I love

511
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,320
her. But like the other characters from section 31 that they introduced back in the Discovery

512
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,240
era were not very interesting. Picard is like the albatross hanging around the entire Star Trek

513
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:18,120
franchise because Picard's season one and two. They're not just bad Star Trek. They're bad TV.

514
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,200
They are I think the worst TV I've ever seen. No, I can't think of anything worse. Like they're

515
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,760
I feel like there's probably shows we haven't watched that are worse. You've never seen Heroes,

516
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,680
right? Uh, I saw some of it like season one or two. Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. Like

517
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,160
afterwards. I don't know because I haven't seen it. But that's what the internet says. So I have

518
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:45,880
to believe them. Fair enough. The worst episode of, you know, pre Alex Kurtzman Trek was probably

519
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,120
Voyager's threshold where they go faster than warp 10 and then like turn into salamanders.

520
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,240
Yeah, that was a weird episode. That was like abysmally bad. Yeah, that was very bad. That was

521
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,560
a weird episode. And Picard is like, it's not just slightly it's not on par. It's worse than

522
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,040
it's not just slightly worse. It is significantly worse. Like Picard. Picard goes from like,

523
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,320
like you can't even laugh at how bad it is. No, we tried. It didn't work. Naomi,

524
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,640
you watched it and you legitimately got went into a depression. Yeah. Like I

525
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,080
wait. It was the last episode of season two or one. I don't remember. What happened in it?

526
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:29,880
I don't remember. Half of this is like just going out of my brain as I'm saying it.

527
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,040
Once season three of Picard is done and Patrick Stewart is safely in the fucking grave.

528
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,200
I'm going to like, I'm sure he'll die immediately after this. If anything, keep him alive is the

529
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Star Trek books. But like, as soon as yeah, Naomi, as soon as the show is done, I'm going to do like

530
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,360
a big review like I did with Obi-Wan Kenobi for Picard because like of everything, because it's

531
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:59,160
so bad. It's so bad. But I did. I like legitimately just felt fucking depressed at how terrible this

532
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,680
show was. And I just like laid in bed for the rest of the day being like, nope, I'm done with

533
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:08,360
humanity. Yep. You were like, it actually like shut you down for a day because Jesus. Yeah. So

534
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:14,920
bad. Like Picard season one, they ruined Picard himself. Yeah. They ruined Data. They ruined the

535
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,640
Borg. They ruined the Romulans. They ruined. Yes, they did. They didn't ruin the Borg till season

536
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,520
two. Nope. They had the, they had the artifact that, that reclaimed Borg cube in the middle of

537
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,800
Romulan space they were working on. They ruined the Borg. They were in the Romulans. They ruined

538
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:36,520
seven of nine. They introduced a bunch of new characters only to ruin them. So Jurati was

539
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:44,200
terrible. Rios was terrible. He was more ruined in season two than season one, but he still was

540
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,920
interesting. No. Oh, actually I read online. So the shit, sorry, if her season three, the ship that

541
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:57,560
um, drug, drug girl, whatever, Rammy, Raffi, Raffi. I don't know why I keep calling her

542
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,120
Remy. I don't know either. Is there, do you know her like a Remy? Remy sounds like a familiar name.

543
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't know a Remy, but there's definitely been a Remy in some sort of media I've been consuming

544
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,120
recently. Oh, it's house. It's house. That's right. Yep. Did you notice that Raffi was in

545
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:17,880
Rios's old ship? Yeah. Guess what? That's not supposed to be Rios's ship. What?

546
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,480
They're there. No, no, no. They're reusing the same set, but it's a different ship,

547
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,480
but you have to make it look different. It looks the same. It's not Rios's ship.

548
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:35,400
Moving on, moving on. How angry with that. I'm annoyed. Okay. They fucked like Elnor was a big

549
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,120
fucking waste. The Romulan, the Romulan Ninja. Okay. I want to point out that you're talking

550
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,760
about season one and like most of these characters got more ruined in season two. Season two was

551
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,720
worse than season one was. Yeah, I'm just going, okay, so here, here, fine, fine, fine. I'll

552
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,680
rewind it then. Fuck. All right. Here's everything that Star Trek Picard ruined in seasons one and

553
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,720
two. Okay. Picard and his relationships to the entire old cast by replacing with a new cast that

554
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,960
all suck. All the new characters that were added were introduced. They were terrible. And then they

555
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,760
were ruined over the course. Like they were made even worse. So Jurati was terrible. Raffi was

556
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,760
terrible. Fucking Rios was terrible. Elnor was terrible. They ruined Seven of Nine. They ruined

557
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,360
Seven of Nine's relationship with Janeway by basically like, like she just, she does so many

558
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,440
things that are like completely against her character arc in Voyager. It's like, remember

559
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,360
when she goes and like gets revenge for Icheb's fucking murder. Yeah. And like, he just has like

560
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:37,560
a gruesome murder for no fucking reason. Other than because the, the actor that played Icheb

561
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:43,240
back in the 90s spoke out against, there was some drama that he spoke out against and the,

562
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,960
and the, and the Star Trek company like turned on him for it because it was against another actor

563
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,240
and the, it was, it was, I don't know the full details. If I ever make a, if I ever make a big

564
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,400
video, I'll get the details. But like, I do recall it was fucking stupid. All right. And they just

565
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,080
pedally like had his character ripped apart for no fucking reason. They, they ruined the Borg. They

566
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,760
ruined the Borg Queen specifically by making fucking, that was really bad. Yeah. They made,

567
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:11,560
they made Jurati. So back in time, in the second season, in the second season, they're in 2024,

568
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:17,880
Jurati becomes the board queen. Yep. She then survives all the way through TNG and Voyager.

569
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,480
And it's like, hold on. So Jurati was in charge of, yeah. So the whole, why, what, why did you

570
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,000
get, if Jurati was on our side the whole time, why did she do all that shit? It was so bad. No,

571
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,080
no, no. They time traveled back. Remember? No, no, no, no. I think the Borg did. Yeah,

572
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,360
they did too. No, they didn't. You sure? No. What happened was Jurati took Rios' ship,

573
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:46,920
which by the way, Rios' ship is now gone. Oh yeah. But they took Rios', she took Gios' ship

574
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,120
and then she flew off to the Borg Collective to become its queen. Yeah. Make the Borg good.

575
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,000
And so. Make the Borg good. And basically over the next however many years it has been.

576
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,160
Yeah. She gets to the Collective, she takes over, she becomes the queen.

577
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:08,520
The issue is that in the actual timeline, the Borg attacked Earth several times,

578
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,160
the Borg attacked Voyager several times, the Borg assimilated 709's family, like the Borg

579
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,520
did all this terrible shit and Jurati was apparently at the head of it the whole time.

580
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:24,120
Why? None of it makes sense. None of it makes sense. I swear. They ruined Q. Oh God. Yeah,

581
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,200
that was. They fucking ruined Q. That was unfortunate. They brought back Wil Wheaton

582
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,760
for one like. That was stupid. When Wil Wheaton came back in season two,

583
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,440
he looked like Wil Wheaton, not like Wesley Crusher. I was just like, hey, that's Wil Wheaton.

584
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,960
And I was like, wait, who did he play again? Oh shit, that's right, it's Wesley. But he's not

585
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,400
actually Wesley, he's just fucking Wil Wheaton. He's just Wil Wheaton and I was just like,

586
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,360
he should have shaved. At least that, yeah. He should have like, not because the character

587
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:57,400
can't grow up, but because we haven't seen the character since he was a teenager.

588
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,240
So he should have shaved to make himself look younger. So and they they fuck. Oh yeah,

589
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:09,240
they ruined like the Khan shit. Project Khan. Remember that? Oh yeah. Yeah. I think with the

590
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,560
exception of the Dominion War, Picard season one and two touched on every single popular,

591
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:23,160
beloved component of Star Trek lore and then raped it. All of it. All of it. And now it's all

592
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:30,760
ruined. And also, there wasn't even any, it wasn't well acted, it wasn't well written.

593
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,920
The characters weren't interesting. No. And there's so many plot holes. Where did that

594
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,240
Romulan guy go? Which one? The villain at the end of season one. I don't even remember who

595
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,040
the villain was. He was just like, he was locked up and he was like, I'm here to save the world.

596
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,480
And then he just disappears from the show. He's never seen him again. Yep. Right? Okay,

597
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,560
there's apparently another dimension full of synthetic life forms that can be called through

598
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:06,760
a portal to destroy all biological life. Mass Effect style, by the way. Season one's dilemma,

599
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,600
which was taken was straight from Mass Effect. It's the fucking Reapers. I want to point out

600
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,800
that as we were watching it for the first time, Dev was just screaming, it's the fucking Reapers.

601
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,480
Like throughout the entire episode. It was obvious. I know, but you were just

602
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,280
yelling it at the TV throughout like the whole episode. Yep. And that's just,

603
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,240
oh, they closed the portal, then it's unresolved. Okay. In season two, the entire setup for season

604
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,320
two, the going back in time, Jiradi becomes the Borg queen. There's always like commentary about

605
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,440
Trump and capitalism and fucking and like homelessness in LA and environmentalism. Oh

606
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:48,920
my God. Everything in season two. And then they get back to the present. It turns out the whole

607
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:57,000
endeavor was to reveal that Jiradi was actually the queen of the Borg and the Borg were there to

608
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,800
help stop a random anomaly that was coming out of a portal. It was a big energy beam and they

609
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,840
force it back in the portal and they close it. And then it's several ships and then it's done.

610
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:11,400
Yeah. It was never explained and fucking Elnor dies. And then he's like, they hail their ship

611
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,000
and then there's like, Elnor's like, I just woke up here on the other ship, dude. It's like,

612
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,240
listen, you weren't even there before. You're a cadet. Like, listen, I'm going to have to do like

613
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,720
a huge video on just how bad seasons one and two were. You're actually going to have to

614
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,680
separate it into like at least three videos. They were the worst TV I've seen. Yeah. That

615
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,400
was pretty bad. On a technical level, on a writing level, on an acting level, on a lore level, like

616
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,640
everything was bad. Yeah. There was like, okay, here, you know what? They tug at the heartstrings

617
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,480
in two scenes, one when Data dies, two when Q dies, when Q dies, when Q says goodbye. That's

618
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,200
it. And you know what? The entire seasons were set up. Yeah. So you have to wade through just

619
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,440
tons of bullshit. And they're like, you'll forget about it because you felt something when you saw

620
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,080
a character that you remember from your childhood die. And it's like, I see what you're doing,

621
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:10,120
but I'm not. That's fucking stupid. All right. Yep. Yep. Yep. So the thing is,

622
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,200
what I'm getting at half hour in, I haven't gotten to the actual show we're talking about.

623
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,120
Yeah. Well, we got to the actual show, which is not this season. What I'm getting at is that

624
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,520
the cards season one and two were the worst TV I've ever seen in my life. Worst Trek,

625
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,440
worst TV. They're both super bad. Worse than any movie that I've seen.

626
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,080
Well, what about some of the bad movies? You know what? I'll sit down and watch

627
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,440
Schizophrenia. I can laugh at it. I can't laugh it. No, but no. Okay. I'm gonna,

628
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,280
I'll get a few laughs at a driller killer. Shout out to red letter media here with their best of

629
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,960
the worst series. I'm sure that a few movies on there, they made it look good because we,

630
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,480
they didn't, we didn't have to watch the full thing they did. I watched some of those movies

631
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,000
though. I watched some of those movies and I enjoyed watching better ones. I enjoyed watching

632
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,600
them more. Okay. I enjoyed watching them more than fucking Picard. Okay. Well, cause here's the

633
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:04,440
thing, like a bad movie is sometimes it's funny bad. Sometimes a really bad movie is just boring.

634
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:11,880
Okay. It's very rare that a show becomes like personally offensive. And that is what Picard is.

635
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,520
It's worse than funny bad. Cause you can have a good time. It's worse than boring cause you're

636
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,520
just bored. But now it's like, Oh, here's the thing that you love and we're going to ruin it

637
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:26,680
actively. That makes it like so much worse. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty bad. It's really bad.

638
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,480
So we get to, we get to season three of Picard and Naomi's like, I don't want to watch it.

639
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:38,360
I don't want to fuck you. We watched it. No, you watched it first. And then you were just

640
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,960
like, listen, it's not as bad as season two or season one or season two is worse though

641
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:50,520
than season one. That's my baseline. So it's not as bad as your low line. It's not a base,

642
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,880
whatever for now. It's the base. Cause I didn't realize that you can get lower than bedrock.

643
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,960
So that was like, listen, it's not as bad. And I think that you're not going to like,

644
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,400
hate yourself for watching this. And I was like, fine. And so we watched it together.

645
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,680
And here's the thing. All right. Season three, episode one of Picard.

646
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,840
It is about as bad as a bad episode of Voyager, which is now on par with discovery.

647
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:27,640
And the thing is, it's still really bad, but it's not like,

648
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:33,320
apocalyptically bad the way that Picard was. Yeah, no, I can't guys, my skew, my like,

649
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,400
is a media bad now is very skewed by Picard. So like anything that's better than Picard,

650
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,360
I'm just like, it's great. The fucking Rotten Tomatoes scores for Picard season

651
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,080
three are through the roof. And I'm like, listen, listen, it's not a 90. It's not a 100. This is

652
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:57,080
like a show that is like, maybe a 45. But that's far better than the zero. All right.

653
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:03,160
So it's season one or two, like watching watching Picard, season three, episode one

654
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:11,960
is kind of like watching Voyager threshold. And that it's really bad and really fucking stupid.

655
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,280
But it could be so much worse. And you know what? Can I say my piece now?

656
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:18,920
Yes, sure. Go ahead.

657
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,560
Is that Will fucking Riker is like keeping that show together.

658
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,280
He is, yeah.

659
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:31,320
Will Riker is keep Will Riker with Picard that we haven't seen in so many years is what's

660
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,200
what kept the episode going for me because I was just enjoying that.

661
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,440
Yeah.

662
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,320
That's all I was enjoying. I was just like, this is great. I miss Will Riker.

663
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,600
Having them back together again.

664
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,120
Yeah. Like he like...

665
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,640
We get some Riker in Lord X. He's kind of fun in that too.

666
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,240
Yeah. Will Riker is always fun everywhere he is. I like his character so much.

667
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,200
I like that he's like old man grumpy Riker now. He's like, oh, my knees hurt. Fuck.

668
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,320
I got to pee so much.

669
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,720
Yeah, but like he's still his character.

670
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,120
Yeah.

671
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,800
Unlike Patrick Stewart.

672
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,560
Yeah. So Will, like the guy who plays Will Riker. Fuck. What was his name?

673
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,720
I entirely forget. I'm so sorry to the actor, but you were just Will Riker to me now.

674
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,600
I'm not going to remember it.

675
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,480
No, you're not.

676
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,240
But you should edit it in.

677
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,880
Yeah, well, the the the character is still Will Riker.

678
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,720
Yeah. However, his old Will Riker.

679
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,880
Yeah. But the issue is, and this is something that we saw in Picard season one and two,

680
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,000
is that the character of Picard is no longer Captain Picard.

681
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,360
Now it's just Patrick Stewart.

682
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,840
Yeah. That's what it feels like, which is so it's so strange, too, because like.

683
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:43,080
I loved Patrick Stewart before Picard, but he was one of my favorite actors, like I, I, I,

684
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,960
unlike most people, because I watched them really young, I fucking love the X-Men movies,

685
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,360
the old X-Men movies. I watched them as a kid, guys. I watched it as a kid. I was biased,

686
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,280
but I thought I loved Patrick Stewart. And you know what? I also really liked

687
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,240
Patrick Stewart in American Dead. This character was of Commander Bullock. So fucking funny.

688
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,640
He was great. And now after watching Picard.

689
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,320
Also, you saw him in TNG. That was good.

690
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,320
Of course.

691
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,560
What's funny is like all through the 90s, everyone was saying if you're going to do

692
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,680
an X-Men movie, you have to get Patrick Stewart before they did it. Yeah.

693
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,720
Yeah. To play Xavier, because, like, he's the perfect character. And he was. It was great.

694
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:23,160
It was the perfect casting. And I'm just I'm so upset that I kind of hate him.

695
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,480
I don't I don't actually hate Patrick Stewart. I'm just I'm just.

696
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,880
Well, it's clear that, like, upset about this character is because of meddling by

697
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,640
Patrick Stewart. Well, he's an executive producer now.

698
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,520
And I think I think the reason they can even do the show is because they brought him in and he's

699
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:45,240
like, I want to do everything my way. And they're like, OK, OK, Mr. Star. Yep. Yep.

700
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,840
Also, I'm fucking 90.

701
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,520
Yeah. Like you like you can tell that Patrick Stewart is like

702
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,200
feeling his age now with the way he like moves on set and stuff.

703
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,600
Yeah. Will Riker. He's he's pretty old, too. But he's like, I'm still good. Let's go.

704
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,000
But OK, so I'm going to give you the quick overview of the plot of season three, episode one.

705
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,240
OK, so it starts out Beverly Crusher. She's been away from she's cut off everyone for 20 years.

706
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,200
She's talked to anyone. She's been off on her own ship doing something.

707
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,720
We don't know what you don't know what yet, but she's being attacked. There's some weird

708
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,400
aliens and masks. They come in with their guns, weird aliens that we can't understand

709
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,640
through the universe translator. I don't know if it was a writing plot hole or if is significant.

710
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,200
You know what it is? It's the fact that they're making an action show.

711
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,840
That's it. They're making like a dumb action hour show. Yeah.

712
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,200
So they come in, there's a firefight. And of course, you know, Beverly gets hit.

713
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,520
She goes, I'm bleeding. She like shoots them. She incinerates one.

714
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,840
It's a very normal, like sci fi action sequence. There's nothing really special about it.

715
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,480
And then afterwards, she sends like a really overly dramatic coded message to Picard

716
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:58,040
on a 20 year old translator or on his bed, on his old badge, which is clearly just like fan service.

717
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,920
But it makes sense in that she doesn't want to be picked up by Starfleet. She's like,

718
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,760
don't tell Starfleet I'm doing something secret out here.

719
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:09,560
I can tell you either. Fuck you. Yeah. And so the message gets to Picard and Picard is back

720
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:15,320
at the Chateau Picard. And he's like, you know what? Despite my entire character, even my entire,

721
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,880
my entire characterization in seasons when I'm to a Picard, I'm going to sell everything

722
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,200
and get rid of all my shit, including all those artifacts I've collected

723
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,840
before he gets the message, by the way. Yeah. Before he gets even he's even like,

724
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,920
man, this this flute that I got from the inner light, I just want to get rid of this thing.

725
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,960
And his new girlfriend is like this Romulan housekeeper of his who was in season two.

726
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,760
No, she's she wasn't a spy, but she was she was a spy for the Romans.

727
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,600
Yeah, but wasn't she a shell? Shall we are tall?

728
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,480
Tal Shiar. Fuck. You're a racist. I'm not racist. I forgot all the words to everything in the

729
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,280
English language. She was an old Tal Shiar. But then after the Romans collapsed, she like ended

730
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,880
up being a refugee and then she was she was just living at Picard's place. Yeah. OK, so.

731
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,480
Yeah, yeah. Basically, at the end of season two, they've got a relationship. Yeah. And so

732
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:13,080
also that Picard and Laris was her name there in this relationship and she's moving off to be some

733
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,640
kind of diplomat on another planet. And Picard's like, I'll go with you. Is she? I didn't even.

734
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,640
I know that's why they're moving. Oh, and Picard is like, you know what? Fuck it. I'll go with you.

735
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,120
I want to abandon everything on my old life and get rid of all my old stuff. Give my old painting

736
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,120
of the Enterprise to Geordi. I don't give a shit. I'm done with this stuff. I want to go have a new

737
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:36,360
adventure with you, my new life partner for the few years I have left. Yeah. He didn't say that.

738
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,080
Even though he's a robot, by the way, he's a robot. Oh, fuck. That's right. They should have

739
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,280
just killed him at the end of season one and then put him put like put him into like a new body or

740
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:55,000
something. You know, he's a robot. You forgot about that. I. Maybe forgot that they never

741
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,920
mentioned it again. They never mentioned it again. But all throughout season two and season

742
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:10,040
three, Picard's a robot now. OK, so they're going off. To have this this this new adventure,

743
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,400
and then he gets the message and he's like, oh, and then she looks at it and she's like,

744
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:19,640
OK, this looks legit. You got to go. And he goes off. He decides to go to ten forward,

745
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:26,040
which, by the way, now after the season's two events, that was retcon to Guinan is she aged

746
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,680
because she wanted to. Yeah, that was weird. That was such a weird explanation of that.

747
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,440
Just wanted to explain what the Goldberg being like fat in her old age. It's always aged.

748
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,360
Exactly. But here's the here's the issue, though. The issue. Yeah, that's right. They said that she

749
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:45,800
was ageless. Yeah. Not that she was ageless, but that we saw her back in the eighteen hundreds and

750
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,480
she looked the exact same as she did in the yeah, on the enterprise. Yeah, but that was also weird,

751
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,320
too, because fucking they show like Guinan in twenty twenty four as being really bitter. And

752
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:02,280
it's like that wasn't Guinan. And also, if they went back in time in TNG for Time's Arrow and

753
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,840
had this this big adventure, why didn't Guinan mention the second adventure that they had

754
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:14,520
together? It's so every all it's all focus on season one, season three focus. They all go to

755
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,240
ten forward, which is now a bar in L.A. Nope. You said it was L.A.? It was San Francisco. Okay.

756
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:28,920
It's now a bar in San Francisco. It was just named after deck ten forward. No, fuck. Yeah.

757
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,920
But now it's like apparently it's like a street address, whatever. Okay. They go to the new ten

758
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,840
four, which is actually the old pre enterprise ten forward that existed back in twenty fucking

759
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:45,000
twenty four in San Francisco. And Picard meets Will Riker there. Yeah. And they look over

760
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,280
and there's always like to try and smooth over how shit the show is. They always throw it through

761
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,480
a few like little references. So they're like, oh, hey, Picard, you wouldn't remember this because

762
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,440
you were you were still recovering from being being fucked up as the cutest. There was there

763
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,040
was a storyline where like there was a computer virus on this. I'm pretty sure this actually

764
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,080
happened. There's a computer virus in the enterprise and it added three to every single

765
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:13,960
digit in the computer. Yeah. Because Picard couldn't figure out how to get the coordinates

766
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:20,360
that Beverly had encoded into this transmission on his very old communicator because he didn't know

767
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:28,120
because of age old history lore reference. Yeah. So Beverly says the name of the virus and Will's

768
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,360
like, I know what that is. You don't, but I do. Yeah. And then adds three to every coordinate.

769
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,320
It turns out it leads to a system outside of Federation space and like, we got to go.

770
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,280
You got to go see what's going on out there. Yeah. So here comes the more stupidity. So this is

771
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,960
the stupid part. So their plan is stupid part. Their plan is to go back to Will Riker's old ship

772
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,080
that he hasn't been captain of in five years now of the Titan, the Titan. He goes back to the

773
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Titan. They pretend to be doing an inspection. For frontier day. This was also a lore reference.

774
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:05,240
No. Pretty sure. Oh, you know what it was? It was 250 years after the start of enterprise where

775
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,520
Jonathan Archer launched the NX-01. That's what it was. They didn't say it in the show,

776
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,080
but that's what it is. I looked it up. So they're celebrating frontier day. There's going to be a

777
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:19,320
parade. They're going to go inspect the ship. A space parade. Yep. They get there. Seven of nine

778
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,240
is the second officer, first officer. Yeah. Which was very surprising. Like how did she,

779
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:30,920
she just joined Starfleet? Well, apparently it's been a while since season two. It's been several,

780
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,000
it's been several years. Yeah. Still only several years. They didn't say that, but yeah. Cause I

781
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,240
think, see, I think seven of nine was like, I mean, this is, this is part of the lore rate

782
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,240
by the way, because in season one, seven of nine was part of the Fenris Rangers, which is some

783
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,960
organization they never fucking explain. It's she was literally just like a lone ranger. Yeah.

784
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,440
And then in season two, she had joined Starfleet and she was like a Lieutenant or something. And

785
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,840
now she's a commander. Oh, did she, was she in Starfleet in season two? Okay. I actually just

786
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,880
forgot, but also this like makes slightly more sense then. Okay. In one year between season

787
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:08,280
one and season two. All right. They have fucking. All right. Eleanor goes from Ninja to, what was

788
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:14,600
that? Oh, it was you, Jesus Christ. Eleanor goes, goes from, Eleanor goes from Ninja to graduating

789
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,840
a four year Academy in one, one and a half years or something ridiculous. He's amazing.

790
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,960
You know, he's Legolas. You know, Kirk made a bet he could do it in three. Yeah. Yeah. And

791
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,920
like that was considered a feat. Yep. And then Eleanor does it in 1.5. Yeah. Okay. Sure. All

792
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:40,360
right. Rios who hates Starfleet is now a captain in Starfleet. Rejoins Starfleet. Rafi who was a

793
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,840
drug addict who was out on the out rejoined Starfleet. She was already part of Starfleet.

794
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,240
And then she just, well, so Rios was too. No, no, I know. But like Rafi, like Rios

795
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,760
stopped because he hated it. Cause he was already a captain, right? I forget. I thought I kind of

796
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:01,960
forget Rios, the story. I don't care for one. I remember he commanded a star ship. They got in

797
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,680
a battle. He lost people. And he was like, fuck this. I'm out. And then Rafi was just having

798
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:13,800
personal issues and she turned to drugs. Yeah. Seven of nine joins up. I mean,

799
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,600
maybe like all the stuff she did under Janeway got her some extra credit or something,

800
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,280
but I don't fucking know. She's she's now a Lieutenant. Well, she was also like,

801
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:25,960
she's still smart. Like you don't see it in the show at all in Picard, but like Janeway

802
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:29,640
seven and nine is like really, really smart because of all the Borg stuff. Right. So,

803
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:37,720
um, and, and Jurati, despite being convicted for murder in season one, they hand that away

804
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,640
in season two. They hand, they hand, they hand wave it away in season two by saying,

805
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,800
Oh, I'm out in parole. Cause they need me for this job. I'm helping out. Yep. So stupid. So,

806
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,520
but anyway, like, so all that shit changes in one year between season one and season two.

807
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,720
Now between season two and season three is apparently several years, but I don't know

808
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,640
how long it is exactly. But basically, seven of nine has been promoted. She's now a commander.

809
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:05,880
She's first mate of the Titan of the Titan. Um, the show really wants to play up the captain of

810
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,600
the Titan as an asshole. But he's actually correct. They, they really, like, I felt it.

811
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,760
Like I was like, Oh, I hate this guy because I, cause like my brain was going TNG rules, TNG.

812
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,200
Like I just kept going. So basically really want you to hate the captain, like really,

813
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,600
Picard and Riker show up and they're like, we got to like sweet talk our way into like getting out

814
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:31,560
to this, this, what is it called? The Rylak system or something? My brain is like, it was the Rio

815
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,680
system. I think it was Rylas, Rylos. It doesn't matter. It's, it's a, it's a far away system

816
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,440
inside of space. Starts with an R. We got to, we got to get, we got to sweet talk this guy into

817
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,000
doing it. And the guy's like, you think I'm a fucking idiot? No. Like I, I read, I know who

818
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,280
you guys are. You guys play loosey goosey with the rules. You're going to fucking try to get my ship.

819
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,800
You're going to get me fucked up. You're going to get my crew fucked up. All right.

820
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,560
Well, you're going to, the ship's going to get blown up or the fucking like, like, no,

821
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,400
I'm going to follow the rules. Fuck you. Yeah. Like, but like, and he's correct.

822
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,840
Yeah. He's actually correct. But said in a much more assholist way,

823
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,680
like all the passive aggressiveness. Ashholist. Ash, Ashholist.

824
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:09,660
Yeah.

825
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,460
Go on.

826
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:21,160
But like said in like the most passive aggressive way, without actually being blunt,

827
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,400
like Dev just wasn't saying all that, you know? He was definitely being a dick towards them.

828
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,360
Cause he was like, he knew something was up though. He's not an idiot.

829
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:35,400
No. And, and, but also seven of nine hated his guts. That was the one thing I was just like, man.

830
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,320
And also I think that if you guys, if you guys end up watching, I hope you guys don't watch

831
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:45,240
season season, season three, episode one. But if you do, I actually think that the main reason

832
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:55,320
that she hates region, I can't fucking talk. Let it go. Let it go. Yes. I think the main reason

833
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:00,920
that she hates like the captain so much is that she shouldn't actually be a first officer.

834
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:07,080
She should just be the, uh, no, like the, like head science officer. Yeah. Because that's what

835
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,280
she was doing on a Voyager. She was an officer, but yeah. Yeah. But like, she was pretty much the

836
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,120
head science officer, but come on. And, but like, she was great and really good at that. But now

837
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:20,200
she's first officer and just hates her fucking job because she has to work immediately under

838
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,960
a cabinet. She doesn't really like, um, just like, okay, so go do science stuff. Cause that's what

839
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:31,160
made you happy. Yeah. You know, I don't know. Like it feels like it's just the whole thing of

840
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:37,400
her character being very different, but there being no lead up to her being very different.

841
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,880
So if you think about Voyager, it's like, well, that doesn't exist anymore.

842
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,960
So here's the thing to actually get along with it, with the story though. Uh, so the sweet talking

843
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,240
doesn't work. She doesn't work seven times. Like fuck it. And then they go there anyway.

844
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,000
And then the captain is like, you know what? You just fucked yourself out of your career.

845
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,720
And someone's like, yeah, I did. Um, Picard and Riker steal a shuttle. They fly out. They find

846
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:09,160
Beverly ship. They dock, um, Beverly's like, by the way, I have another son. No. Okay. Beverly

847
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:15,640
was unconscious in the ship and she was in a medical thing and this guy just randomly attacks

848
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:22,840
Will and Picard. And it turns out that it's Beverly's son who knows who the dad is. I have

849
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,400
a feeling it's probably Picard though. They didn't bang though. You sure? I'm pretty sure

850
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,560
it's going to be retcon that they did right before she left. Okay. But basically this kid is old

851
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:36,840
enough that he could be like 20 or 21, which means that they might've had it. It also could be the

852
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:41,560
case that she had the kid after they split up. I am 100% telling you right now that it's going to

853
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:51,160
be Picard's kid who, and part of the reason that she left is because they had like a, like a,

854
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:56,040
we're going to get back together, bang. And then they didn't and she left, but was pregnant. So

855
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,880
they're just doing the exact story that they did with Kirk. Yes. Where Kirk had like a random son

856
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,520
from like a scientist woman. 100% that's going to be. Do you think he's going to get killed like

857
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:10,760
Kirk's son did? Maybe. Is this the same story? Maybe. Okay. Here's the thing though. What's

858
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,480
really weird about it is that this kid has to be at least 20 years younger than Wesley.

859
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:21,320
Yeah. Yeah. Like that's a, that's a weird feeling. It's like, wow. Imagine like having a sibling

860
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:25,000
that is like 20 or 25 years older than you. Like, holy fuck. For a while I actually thought like,

861
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,600
is this just going to be Wesley with like, like de-aged? Do you go with like a de-aging machine

862
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,680
or did he like, did he get like, like plastic surgery done? He's like, no, it's probably a

863
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:39,080
new kid. It's probably a new kid. 100%. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I don't think Wesley would have

864
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,680
attacked Will like that. Though it would be good to see Wesley get bitch slapped.

865
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,960
Cause Will just fucking smacks him. You mean Will Wheaton get bitch slapped? Yes.

866
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:54,440
I like how whenever like Will Wheaton has a bad take on Twitter, people just spin him with,

867
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:01,480
shut up Wesley. It's really fucking funny. Yeah. That's pretty funny. Funny. Yeah.

868
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:06,680
Funnily. Funnily. Funnily funny. That's my name. Don't wear it out. But that's the end of the show

869
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:14,760
because not Will Wheaton. Not Wesley Crusher is like, Hey, by the way, guys look out the window

870
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,520
and they look out and it's like this giant fucking ship that's meant to be really intimidating. But

871
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,640
I'm like, listen, we've seen this with the scimitar and it was at nemesis or insurrection. We've seen

872
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,360
this with the, with the Romulan mining ship and the reboot. There's, there's been a lot of

873
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,840
Star Trek villain ships where they come out of the nub and it's like,

874
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:39,400
dah, dah, dah. And it's like a central pod with like a bunch of like spiky bits pointing forward

875
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,360
off the sides to make it look like it's yeah. Yeah. And it's like, okay, I get it. You're

876
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,120
trying to be intimidating, but we've seen this in Star Trek so many times now this exact fucking

877
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:54,600
ship. It's like, okay. Yep. Didn't matter. Yeah. So like clearly this episode that's the end of the

878
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:01,400
episode. Um, clearly the episode is meant to be, it's like a set up episode. We're not going to

879
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:08,760
get any of these questions answered right away. Um, and it feels like they were the, uh, for,

880
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,400
for this episode and the season, they're like, listen, we know we fucked up, dude,

881
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,680
can you please just give us another chance? And the reason it feels like that is because

882
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:20,920
one there's so many old lore call. Oh, wait, we forgot all about, uh, Raffi. Oh, that's right.

883
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:27,640
Raffi has a completely, completely unconnected story. Yep. So Raffi is like an undercover

884
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,760
officer somewhere, somewhere on some, on some like party planet. Cause every planet is just

885
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:38,200
like the party planet or the ice planet or the city planet or whatever the bad city planet,

886
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:43,080
the fire planet, where the bad Orion's hang out the desert planet. Yep. Yeah. So she's like

887
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:48,200
undercover. She gets information about an incoming terrorist attack. Yep. And she's like, what the

888
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:52,680
fuck does it mean, dude? And she's talking to like either an AI or a person with like a coded voice

889
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,200
or something. No, no. She's, she's talking to a secret handler. That's what they said. Yeah.

890
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:59,640
Cause she's part of Starfleet intelligence and Starfleet intelligence is like, doesn't want to

891
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,800
reveal who they are to her. The handler doesn't because it's like, it's undercover. Right. Yeah.

892
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,760
And Raffi is like, listen, dude, there's something, something big is going to happen. They, they,

893
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,760
they stole this experimental portal technology. It's literally portals from the game portal.

894
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,720
You open up two fucking portals. You can walk through it. It's like, that's what it is. All

895
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,280
right. But it's really big. And she like flies into it's not earth. It's like a different planet.

896
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:23,720
Yeah. And she flies, there's like a Federation like city on a different planet. And she flies

897
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,800
down and she's like, guys, there's like a Starfleet base there. And she's like, listen,

898
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,240
guys, you're going to get fucked. There's a terrorist attack incoming. I need to talk to

899
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:36,120
someone like several times the words I need to talk to someone right now, like no Starfleet

900
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:40,360
codes or anything. Just I'm screaming into the PA. I need to talk to someone. Because Raffi is

901
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,560
fucking incompetent. Yeah. Always has been. Yeah. And then, and then she watches like a portal open

902
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:51,160
up underneath the building and the entire building falls into the portal. Yeah. The portal opens

903
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:56,120
right above the building to the right. Yeah. It's like, it's like one city block over. Yeah. So it

904
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:00,920
doesn't even like, it's not even in another part of like the city, like somewhere like, especially

905
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:07,240
like, Oh God, there's, there's an orphanage here. No, it's just like, Oh, and here's the

906
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:12,040
building. And I was like, Oh, okay. And the building just like falls onto the street. Yeah.

907
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:15,560
And like, it's, it's clearly like a big fucking disaster. There's probably a lot of people who

908
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,560
died. There was a lot of screaming. Yeah. Yeah. But then, which is kind of funny because she's

909
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:23,160
like, how did Raffi hear that? She's in her ship. She's above the city. She's like watching this.

910
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,320
And you're also, even the camera's really far away from it. Like, but basically it was also,

911
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,960
what would be screaming? They're all like dead. Well, the people around the people who didn't get

912
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,480
squished. To be fair, I actually watched because I watched this episode twice, once on my own,

913
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,240
once with you. And I watched like the second time through, I watched all the little cars

914
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:43,560
driving around the city and like they did a decent job with detail because like cars that

915
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,840
were approaching the disaster stopped and like cars that were on the way away, like sped up.

916
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:53,880
I was like, they actually made it look like it was nice. Yeah. That was like their big

917
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:59,320
effect shot for the episode. Yeah. I do always appreciate when, uh, the, a show will go like

918
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:03,800
in depth and far away shots. Even, even if you don't notice them on a first watch, you notice

919
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,840
them, you'll notice them on like a second or third and be like, Oh, that's neat. Like I,

920
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,640
it does definitely boost points in the, how much do I like the show skill? Yeah. So this

921
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:20,760
Starfleet outpost or whatever is destroyed and Rafi's like, Oh my God. Didn't she just start

922
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,720
crying? Kind of. I don't remember. Kind of. Her reaction was very kind of blase. Well,

923
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,000
she's not a very good actress to be honest. She's, she's talked about everything the entire show.

924
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,920
No, listen, I actually think that the actress is pretty good. Oh yeah. It's just the character

925
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:39,080
was really bad. Oh, okay. No, no. I legit like she, cause she's done good because like she isn't

926
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:44,600
like, she isn't like a Kristen Stewart where like she just hasn't had any like facial changes or

927
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,480
anything. Apparently she's actually a good actress too. It's just the Twilight sucked.

928
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:53,400
No, because I saw her in, um, snow white. There, there was a snow white movie with

929
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,880
Kristen Stewart as snow white. Yeah. Like it was, it was like a snow white, like not a parody,

930
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:02,520
not cause of comedy, but like a shitty one. Sure. I don't even remember, but she was in that. I'm

931
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,920
like, she's just doing the same thing with her face. Okay. Apparently though she has a new movie,

932
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,160
I think about some, it has something to do with British royalty and she looks pretty good in that.

933
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,640
I saw different emotions on her face and I was like, Oh shit. For the first time she experienced

934
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:21,560
emotion. I'm sure she experienced most in other times, but like in, in the very few things I've

935
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:26,680
seen her in, I haven't really seen her face change very much. Right. But anyway, like it's not the

936
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,880
actress is not like doing that and she's not only just doing one thing, but she has different,

937
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:38,360
like she has very hammy. Well, yeah, but like the characters hammy, you know, like this character

938
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:45,400
is like a, like a semi crazed like drug addict who is not a drug addict at the moment, but at least

939
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,560
was, you know, and it has like, it's fucked up her family life. It's fucked up her work life,

940
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:57,880
like, and just like is very, very emotional person, emotional reacting person first.

941
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:03,640
But I actually thought that her reaction to the, like the disaster, the disaster was very,

942
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:08,200
just like, and tears because like she was just getting really frustrated with not being able

943
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:13,320
to figure out like what was happening. The issue with, with Rafi's story is that it's completely

944
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,800
disconnected and separate from the rest of the story. The moment it is, there's no crossover

945
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,440
scenes. There's definitely going to be, of course there's, but like the main cast doesn't even

946
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,080
mention Rafi. No one knows what she's doing. No one cares. Oh, you know what? I bet it is.

947
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,720
I bet that the aliens who were attacking Beverly's ship are also the ones who have that

948
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,760
portal technology. Yeah. That's going to be what the connection is. Yeah, probably. But anyway,

949
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:47,400
the episode itself, not very good, but at least not offensively bad. No. Yeah. It's not as bad

950
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,120
as Picard seasons one and two. And that's like high praise for this. That's why it's getting

951
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,280
such high marks on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, also because everyone's like,

952
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:01,480
Oh my God, everyone's back. Beverly crushers. Well, here's the thing. So they expelled all

953
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:07,000
the cast of season one and two. Except for Rafi, Seven of Nine and Rafi. And Rafi's in a new

954
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,520
character. What's her name? The housekeeper. Oh, Laris. Yeah, Laris and Laris. Those are the only

955
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,560
three we see. And I have a feeling that Laris is also going to be out for the season. She's not

956
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,400
going to show back up. No, of course she will. No. Me at the very end. Listen, she wasn't in

957
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:24,680
season two at all. She was a different character. Yeah, but they still had the actress. Yeah, I

958
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,880
know. But still it wasn't Laris. And in season one, she was there for half a season. Yeah,

959
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,640
but that's because she had to protect Picard. Yeah. For a little bit. And she wasn't there

960
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:38,120
that much. Just when he went back to the Chateau. She wasn't there that much. You're, I think. No,

961
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:43,800
no, no. Because Picard spent like before he was in the Chateau for like four out of 10 episodes

962
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:51,240
of season one. Yeah, well, that's because the robot girl, spoilers, you know, had to rest and

963
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,480
heal and not be attacked. No, I know. There was reasons for it. But no, Laris was around for a

964
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,320
good chunk of season one and she came back at the end of season one too. But no, here, let me, let

965
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:06,680
me, let me put it this way. Let me put it this way, okay? All the characters were so annoying

966
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:12,280
from season one and two. All the new characters. And they had, they basically had concluded all

967
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,960
of their stories, even though the conclusions were terrible and the stories were terrible.

968
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,840
They were done. So they just kicked all them out and they're like, fuck it. As I mentioned before,

969
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:25,960
they really wanted this to be like the worst story show. So they brought back all the regulars from

970
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:31,320
TNG as main story season. Yeah, it was still, it's still the worst story show of the season. But

971
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:39,800
anyway, they brought back all the regulars of TNG. So Worf's gonna be in it. And that, that,

972
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:45,160
that's already been announced. Yes. He's not in it yet. But we've seen Will and Beverly

973
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:52,760
Crusher, but Geordi's coming back. Worf's coming back. Deanna? Deanna Troi's coming back. Data's

974
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:58,040
dead, but apparently his actor is playing Lor. So Lor's coming back. Okay, one thing I want to

975
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:05,240
say about the Star Trek universe is that I love the fact that like Data and Lor and all of what's,

976
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:09,480
what's the scientist's name? The Soong family. Yeah, the Soong family is all just fucking played

977
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:15,240
by Brent Spiner. That's my favorite trope of Star Trek and it's great. Like even in season two,

978
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:23,320
Brent Spiner is like, like Asian ancestors, still Brent Spiner. Yeah. It's great. I love it. Yep.

979
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:30,120
But it's so stupid. But Lor's coming back because you got to have Brent Spiner in the show.

980
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:34,600
Apparently Tasha Yar's coming back. Okay, you told me she was dead. She is dead.

981
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,480
How? Maybe Picard hallucinates or something on his deathbed again. It's like 15th deathbed.

982
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:45,480
Who knows? Not Tasha Yar. Tasha Yar is dead. I meant the actress. The actress is dead,

983
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:50,280
according to Dev. No, you told me. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. You told me the actress was dead.

984
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,120
100%. I said the character was dead. No, you told me the actress was also dead.

985
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:58,920
Because she was the one that turned to like drug use and such, right? No, no, no, no, no, no.

986
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,960
That was Kesa's actress from Voyager. She's not dead though. She's like a drug-addled freak

987
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:07,560
living in like Ohio or like fucking Wyoming or something. They're both white and blonde,

988
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:13,160
mixed it up. Oh, white blonde and short hair? Yeah. No, man. Dude, Kesa's actress. Oh,

989
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,760
fuck. Like you've seen those pictures, right? Okay, no. She's like, she's like running around

990
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:21,240
like a fucking crack shack, exposing herself, like exposing her naked body of children

991
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,960
on the street. She's like driving while like fucking heroin'd up. Like she, she's fucked.

992
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,760
Yeah. She, she was like, yeah, you know, I, I had a few problems like back in 2012. She was like,

993
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,000
I had a few problems. I got my life turned around. I'm gonna go back to school for like

994
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,600
culinary arts. Nope. She just, she's, she's just, she's just fucking meth. That's all she is now.

995
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:43,160
She's just meth. She's a person of meth. Okay. No, I thought Tasha Yara's actress was dead.

996
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,480
Nope. Okay. Denise Crosby's still alive. That makes more sense then. Yeah.

997
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,480
There's going to be either time travel, shenanigans or hallucinations then.

998
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,000
Yeah. And I have a feeling it might be hallucinations this time because they already

999
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,760
did the time travel. Yeah. So it's probably hallucinations. Or maybe they'll like bring

1000
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,600
back the actress, actress, but have her play that half Romulan child that she had.

1001
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,400
Oh, maybe. That might be it. Is there anyone else they're getting from TNG to come back?

1002
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:15,160
I think some side characters. Oh, we're on the Wikipedia right now. Jack Crusher is coming back.

1003
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:20,040
Who's Jack? Oh, that's the kid. That's the spoiler.

1004
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,160
Oh, I thought it was, well, wasn't, wasn't her husband named Jack Crusher?

1005
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,280
Pretty sure he was not. Is this Jack Crusher Jr.?

1006
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,200
Oh yeah. They're adding a couple of the Forge kids.

1007
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,240
Which is great.

1008
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:36,680
Yep. Oh, and they're bringing back Professor Moriarty. The holodeck guy.

1009
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,480
Oh my God.

1010
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,000
They got him back for some reason.

1011
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,600
It's going to be bad, but I'm excited, but it's going to be bad.

1012
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:50,280
It is going to be bad. Like he's supposed to be, I guess, a villain in this. Why? Okay.

1013
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,280
No, he might just be there to like help them out because he was just stuck in the holodeck,

1014
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,760
remember? Like, but they saved his program because he was alive.

1015
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,560
Yeah. Yeah.

1016
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,440
Because, yeah.

1017
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,560
Instead of letting him be like the doctor on Voyager, they just, yeah.

1018
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:11,480
Well, they didn't have, they didn't have, what are they called? Portable, portable emitters.

1019
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,920
Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah.

1020
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,160
Mobile emitter is what they called it.

1021
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:15,640
Yep.

1022
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,440
They didn't have that.

1023
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,720
There's not much to say about season three, episode one, because it's...

1024
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:20,440
It's just the setup.

1025
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,080
It's just the setup.

1026
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:21,480
But like...

1027
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,800
This is why we probably should have waited to do this video.

1028
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,560
No. Well, here's the... I didn't have anything else ready for today. So this is my filler.

1029
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,960
See, I want to point out that I said that Dev is lazy with his work at the beginning of this.

1030
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,520
Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here.

1031
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,280
I am excited to see Geordi, though.

1032
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:40,760
Yeah.

1033
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,160
I'll say that.

1034
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,080
Apparently the visor's gone. He has eyes now.

1035
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:45,720
Yeah, but there was always an option for him, Dev.

1036
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,160
It was, but remember he said, I don't want them. I like the visor.

1037
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,760
He said that he made it a part of his identity that he didn't want to get real eyes.

1038
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,800
Then he got real eyes.

1039
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:59,080
Okay. I do want to point out that that one is slightly more okay. Only, only...

1040
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:02,840
No. They're erasing blind representation. It's bigoted.

1041
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:09,480
Fine. Only because he mentioned that the visor gives him headaches every single day.

1042
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,040
Yeah.

1043
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:16,360
Yeah. If I'm an old person, I'm already in pain. I don't want the additional pain of headaches.

1044
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:18,840
If I can get rid of it. So...

1045
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:20,520
Yeah, I guess.

1046
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:24,440
And also it's like way in the future. It's probably just visor eyes.

1047
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:25,880
That's what they are, yeah.

1048
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,320
Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm saying.

1049
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,200
Why wouldn't you give everyone visor eyes, though?

1050
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,560
Because not everyone's comfortable with taking their eyes out.

1051
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:35,000
Yeah, I guess, but they're better.

1052
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,480
This is not cyberpunk. This doesn't happen that often.

1053
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:43,880
Yeah. I think there's an idea that, in Trek at least, there's this idea that the reason

1054
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,800
humans don't augment their body all the time, even though they could, is because they're...

1055
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,600
It's partially illegal.

1056
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,560
No, no, it's not. Because they gave Nog a fake leg after the Dominion War.

1057
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,520
Yeah, because he lost his actual leg.

1058
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:02,120
But here's the thing. They basically say, we don't feel this need anymore to constantly

1059
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:06,040
improve ourselves. We're comfortable the way that we are. And they play it off as some sort

1060
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,840
of maturity, where humanity has grown up. They're not vain anymore. They're not greedy anymore.

1061
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,680
So they don't feel the need to replace their body with robot parts all the time.

1062
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,200
They're comfortable in their own skin, and they only do it if they have to.

1063
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:25,240
So it's almost like a moral component of their society, that they're not doing the cyberpunk

1064
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:25,960
thing.

1065
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,720
Yeah, I think... I have a feeling that their morality is probably based around plastic

1066
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,000
surgery. You know?

1067
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:38,760
Well, yeah, because we're, at the moment, in real life, society is not at the level

1068
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:44,680
of being able to comfortably replace body parts with much more functional...

1069
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,680
We'll get there eventually, I think.

1070
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,640
No, no, we definitely will, because we're getting pretty close. But the thing is, there's

1071
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:54,520
also phantom pain and stuff, and you'd have to get past that part first. There's extra

1072
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:58,760
stuff. We're getting close. We're not there yet, though. So since we're not there yet,

1073
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:04,760
the only closest thing that you could associate actual morality to when it comes to cyberpunk

1074
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:11,080
like stuff, like the whole replacing your body with robot parts, is plastic surgery

1075
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:15,880
for vaneness. Because generally, people who are not getting plastic surgery for a specific

1076
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:20,280
medical reason, just to look better, are technically being vain. I am not against plastic

1077
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,120
surgery, by the way. I'm not.

1078
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,760
You like giant Brazilian butts right in your face?

1079
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,720
Sure, why not? I'm attracted to Kim Kardashian, I'll say it.

1080
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,000
Jesus Christ.

1081
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,480
Yeah.

1082
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,440
I'm done with you.

1083
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:35,160
Yeah, but like, I'm not against plastic surgery for people who want to do that. But I think

1084
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:40,200
that if we're just like, especially in the 50s or 60s or whatever, like for the old show,

1085
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:46,280
no one's augmenting anything. You could only really relate that back to probably plastic surgery.

1086
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:46,840
Maybe, yeah.

1087
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:52,280
Yeah. Of course, I don't know how good plastic surgery was in the 50s to make this comparison.

1088
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,680
So maybe I'm just totally fucking wrong. I don't fucking know. But I'm just saying,

1089
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:02,360
it probably stems from that. And then, you know, cyberpunk is slightly more newish thing.

1090
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:03,800
Well, in terms of-

1091
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,400
More mainstream newish thing.

1092
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,680
In terms of Picard, though.

1093
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,160
Yeah.

1094
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,280
It's not a good show.

1095
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:08,440
No.

1096
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,480
I wouldn't recommend anyone watch it.

1097
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,440
Nobody should watch it.

1098
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:18,520
There's nothing really like good about it, frankly. I didn't enjoy watching it. I didn't,

1099
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:24,920
I don't think that like, there's lower callbacks, but it's cheap. It feels cheap. Everything does

1100
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:33,960
not, nothing in the show is good. The only plus that I can give this show is that it's not Picard

1101
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:39,160
seasons one and two. That's it. It's still a bad show. Everything's still negative. I still

1102
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:40,520
wouldn't watch it if I was on my own.

1103
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:45,400
No. I would not have missed anything in my life if I'd never watched this.

1104
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:50,440
I have heard some people say that they did the reset button on season three so cleanly

1105
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:56,200
that if you just went from like Nemesis and Insurrection to Picard season three,

1106
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:56,920
You wouldn't have missed anything.

1107
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:02,920
You wouldn't miss anything because nothing that happens in seasons one and two really matter that

1108
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:10,440
Which is a really bad episode. Like that's a such a bad show. Take like, Oh yeah,

1109
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:14,760
you're going to skip the first two seasons of the show and it won't have been anything. It's fine.

1110
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,360
I'm just like, wow, that's just sad.

1111
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,800
Cause none of the lore stuck. None of the characters stuck around except for Raffi.

1112
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:27,720
Her character can just be explained away by, Oh, she's an intelligence. Obviously has it like,

1113
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,080
obviously was a drug addict.

1114
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,840
Yeah. Cause she drops the drugs in the scene.

1115
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,760
There's there's, you know what I'll say for that moment of,

1116
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,520
since I'm watching house currently, I'm binge watching, watching Dr. House.

1117
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:44,440
They did the, her like looking at the drugs and like dropping them. And like, I think she was,

1118
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,240
was she still holding drugs in the ship? No.

1119
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,120
No. Okay. So she dropped the drugs that she definitely kind of wanted to take.

1120
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,320
And they did that moment very well. I enjoy that. I was like, is she going to do it?

1121
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,280
Cause I wasn't sure. Cause like with lots of Picard,

1122
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:01,080
as soon as a character encounters a crossroads like that,

1123
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:03,800
I can almost instantly be like, they're going to do that. And then they do.

1124
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,760
And I'm always right. Which is like, I'm not smart. So this is like,

1125
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:12,920
that's a really bad sign of a show that I can just immediately tell what a character is going to do

1126
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,240
when they come to a crossroads and they don't surprise me.

1127
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:19,560
You know, but they did that moment very well. Like she definitely, she dropped it,

1128
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:24,600
but it was a very uncertain moment. So I th I think they might do that storyline a bit

1129
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:29,080
better than what they currently were doing. Cause in season two, it wasn't an issue at all.

1130
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,600
I think she was over it. Yeah. Yeah. But now she's not.

1131
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:38,600
Whatever. Yeah. So that's bad. But if you forget about season two, that is fine.

1132
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:42,760
You can forget about season one. You can forget about the entire show.

1133
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,960
Yeah. Well, no, actually, cause. If you forget that all of Picard

1134
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,880
existed, your life will probably be better. Your life will be better. Yeah, definitely.

1135
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:57,480
Yeah. So I guess that's, that's what happened in season, in season three, episode one. It's,

1136
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:05,240
it's still not good. I'm still not enjoying watching the show, but it's not, it's not.

1137
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:11,400
I'm now enjoying it. Yeah, no, I, I legitimately have been so scarred by season one and two of

1138
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:19,080
Picard that like my bad, like levels of is media bad or actually ruined. Anything that is not as

1139
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:23,160
bad as season two, Picard and was like, it's good. I can watch this. It's great. Like, like,

1140
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:29,240
like with Velma. Yeah. I can watch this. It's fine. I have been ruined and it's your fault.

1141
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:32,920
Oh, it's my fault. Yes. You made me watch it. I would not have watched it otherwise.

1142
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:38,280
I'd have watched a couple, a few episodes of Picard season one and been like, fuck this show.

1143
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,560
I hate everything. I don't want to watch star Trek stuff for a while now.

1144
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,680
No, because of you, I've been ruined and you've been kind of ruined too.

1145
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:53,000
And it's all your fault. It's all your fault for making me watch it.

1146
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,040
That's okay. We're going to get a good video out of it one day.

1147
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:00,600
No, you'll get a good video. I will just be ruined with nothing to show for it.

1148
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:01,480
I'll put you into the video.

1149
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,800
Don't watch Picard. Don't do it. It's bad.
