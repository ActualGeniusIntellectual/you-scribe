WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.980
Good morning, everyone. Dev and Naomi are back together again. We broke up for a while, but...

00:05.660 --> 00:08.180
They're gonna actually believe that, you know.

00:11.180 --> 00:16.780
What I mean... What I mean by this is we haven't done a Dev and Naomi talks about

00:17.440 --> 00:20.920
TV or movie or whatever since I think... How was the dragon?

00:20.920 --> 00:21.420
Was it?

00:21.420 --> 00:21.920
It was because you're lazy.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.420
Because you're lazy, too.

00:23.420 --> 00:26.320
I am lazy in my own way.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.320
Well, you can't even complain!

00:28.380 --> 00:30.720
No, no, you're lazy when it comes to your work.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.720
Listen, okay? That's not true and you know it.

00:33.720 --> 00:34.720
Yes, it is.

00:36.720 --> 00:37.720
That's what you get.

00:37.720 --> 00:38.720
Stop.

00:40.020 --> 00:43.720
So we have our morning coffees. It's reasonably in the morning for us and uh...

00:43.720 --> 00:45.720
Yeah, okay.

00:46.820 --> 00:52.320
We have our coffees and we're gonna be here to talk about Star Trek Picard season 3.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.320
Episode 1!

00:54.720 --> 00:57.720
Okay, so here. Let me give you the TLDR, alright?

00:57.720 --> 01:00.720
When I first met Naomi, she didn't know what Star Trek was.

01:00.720 --> 01:01.720
Yep.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.720
And I was like, you know what? I think you'd actually like it. Even though it's not like...

01:04.720 --> 01:07.720
You thought before me it was like just another generic sci-fi action series, right?

01:07.720 --> 01:10.720
Yeah, because hashtag Star Wars was always bad.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.720
How is that related?

01:12.720 --> 01:17.720
Because that's another generic sci-fi series that was, you know, really popular that I didn't know that much about.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.720
You're getting more beatings for that. Here they are. Here they are.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.720
Ow.

01:22.120 --> 01:24.120
Okay, so listen.

01:25.120 --> 01:30.120
But Star Trek is not a generic sci-fi action series. It has action.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.120
But it's also like, it's kind of comedic, it's kind of dramatic.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.120
But it's like a procedural, you know?

01:35.120 --> 01:36.120
Yeah.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.120
And it's a very good procedural.

01:38.120 --> 01:42.120
And it probably... it basically started the genre of what it is.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.120
It's like...

01:45.120 --> 01:47.120
Wait, what other shows are like Star Trek?

01:48.120 --> 01:50.120
That are not Star Trek related?

01:50.520 --> 01:51.520
Like other Star Trek shows?

01:51.520 --> 01:53.520
And The Orville doesn't count.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.520
Because it's a Star Trek parody, right?

01:55.520 --> 01:56.520
Yeah. The Orville doesn't count.

01:56.520 --> 01:57.520
I guess it is kind of something...

01:57.520 --> 02:03.520
Well, here's the thing. If you go back really far, like before Star Trek, you can find stuff like Flash Gordon.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.520
Which is very much... which is very similar.

02:05.520 --> 02:10.520
But it's like... it was that way because that was like a black and white convention.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.520
And they couldn't really do what they could do with tech.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.520
But with Star Trek...

02:14.520 --> 02:18.520
I don't know, like there's one... like firstly, Star Trek was always like an optimistic series.

02:18.520 --> 02:19.520
Yeah, definitely.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.920
It was never like the grim dark future.

02:21.920 --> 02:22.920
It was always like...

02:22.920 --> 02:26.920
You know, yeah, humanity had some bad spots and you can see some of the bad spots in Star Trek.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.920
But you pulled through it and now things are like better.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.920
It's like... it's a bright future overall.

02:32.920 --> 02:37.920
And secondly, it was always about the characters and their relationships.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.920
And they were always mature.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.920
They never pulled punches.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.920
The episode that comes to mind, now that I'm thinking about it,

02:47.320 --> 02:51.320
is that one episode where Worf is asked to donate blood to a Romulan.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.320
Of TNG, you should say.

02:53.320 --> 02:56.320
Yeah, and he... and you know, Worf hates Romulans.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.320
Yeah.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.320
Because he's being racist.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.320
He has a reason, but still.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.320
Yeah, he has a...

03:00.320 --> 03:07.320
I don't know, like if you know a race... like a specific race kills your entire family, spoilers.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.320
You're a racist, Naomi.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.320
Naomi's a racist.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.320
Then you get to be a little bit racist.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.320
Just a little.

03:13.720 --> 03:14.720
Here's the thing.

03:15.720 --> 03:19.720
You know, a show... another show, especially another show nowadays,

03:19.720 --> 03:23.720
would resolve the moral dilemma by having like a third option.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.720
Like just give you an easy way out.

03:25.720 --> 03:26.720
But TNG didn't.

03:26.720 --> 03:32.720
TNG said, listen, either you let Worf be racist and let this Romulan die

03:32.720 --> 03:37.720
or you violate his rights and make him donate the blood.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.720
And the show doesn't pull that punch.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.720
It allows Worf to be racist and the Romulan dies

03:43.120 --> 03:44.120
and then there's actually a consequence to it.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.120
And it's like, OK, so...

03:46.120 --> 03:53.120
It's nice because you get... it's more realistic than having that magical third option.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.120
Because oftentimes in real life, you don't get the magical third option.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.120
You get two shitty options and that's all you get.

03:58.120 --> 04:01.120
Sometimes there's only one shitty option, but that's the conversation.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.120
Yes.

04:02.120 --> 04:09.120
But that was what made TNG... like all of Star Trek, but TNG especially special to me.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.120
Yeah.

04:10.520 --> 04:15.520
And there weren't like fucking Marvel style quips 24-7.

04:15.520 --> 04:21.520
It didn't mind being a bit grimy and edgy when it had to be,

04:21.520 --> 04:24.520
but that wasn't like... humans were kind of past that.

04:24.520 --> 04:29.520
That wasn't the theme of any of the shows in the Star Trek universe.

04:29.520 --> 04:34.520
Even the darkest show, Deep Space Nine, still had that thread of optimism going through it.

04:34.920 --> 04:39.920
Because when we encounter the darker sections of Starfleet, like section 31,

04:39.920 --> 04:43.920
our heroes are rightly disgusted by what they do.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.920
So there's...

04:45.920 --> 04:51.920
It basically... it provided like this sense of liberal optimism towards the future

04:51.920 --> 04:54.920
and about how humanity is going to turn out.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.920
It's not going to be perfect, it's not going to be Utopia,

04:57.920 --> 05:02.920
but basically the idea that it's not going to be a fucking cyberpunk grimdark hellhole

05:03.320 --> 05:05.320
where everything sucks.

05:05.320 --> 05:10.320
However, after 9-11, that type of science fiction became way more...

05:10.320 --> 05:14.320
it was already popular in the 80s, but it became way more popular after 9-11.

05:14.320 --> 05:18.320
And they tried to like make... they tried to like update Star Trek in that way,

05:18.320 --> 05:22.320
so like they did the whole like an enterprise, like the Xindi attacking Earth

05:22.320 --> 05:26.320
and that didn't help the show, it still got cancelled.

05:26.320 --> 05:32.320
They tried to like make it just a straight action movie with the J.J. Abrams reboot

05:32.720 --> 05:36.720
and I think... like those were okay movies, but they weren't really Star Trek movies.

05:36.720 --> 05:40.720
Yeah, after... like I really enjoyed those movies before I knew anything about Star Trek

05:40.720 --> 05:44.720
because of course I saw those first, because I didn't watch old things before you, because you know...

05:44.720 --> 05:46.720
Because you're a fucking Zoomer, I know.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.720
Yeah, totally.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.720
But they were... they were really good.

05:50.720 --> 05:54.720
I really enjoyed watching them, but then after watching Star Trek, I'm just like...

05:54.720 --> 05:55.720
Oh.

05:55.720 --> 05:56.720
Yeah, that's not what they were supposed to be.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.720
Oh.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.720
The reason... okay, I know, here's like what Picard sees in 3 episode 1.

06:00.120 --> 06:04.120
The reason I'm doing all this is because... I'm describing all this because Naomi didn't know

06:04.120 --> 06:07.120
what Star Trek was really before she met me.

06:07.120 --> 06:10.120
And maybe some of you watching still don't know what Star Trek is, and that's okay.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.120
No, it's not.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.120
You should watch it.

06:12.120 --> 06:16.120
But no, we sat down, over the course of like the first half of our relationship,

06:16.120 --> 06:19.120
we sat down and watched every single Star Trek.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.120
Yeah, everything.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.120
We started chronologically.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.120
Yes, we started with the original series.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.120
Which was surprisingly good.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.120
For the time.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.120
You have to remember that it was a 50s show?

06:28.120 --> 06:29.120
60s show.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.520
I think it was a 60s show.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.520
I don't remember.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.520
I think it was like 1969?

06:33.520 --> 06:37.520
So once you go into the mindset of this is a really old show and it's not gonna be perfect,

06:37.520 --> 06:40.520
but it's still gonna, you know, it's still gonna be Star Trek, it's great.

06:40.520 --> 06:41.520
Yes.

06:41.520 --> 06:42.520
Then we watched the animated series.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.520
Yeah.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.520
Which was just kind of goofy.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.520
Yeah, that was goofy, but also a product of its time.

06:46.520 --> 06:47.520
Yeah.

06:47.520 --> 06:48.520
Yeah.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.520
It's like watching Scooby-Doo again.

06:49.520 --> 06:50.520
Yep.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.520
Then we watched TNG.

06:51.520 --> 06:55.520
But here's the thing, we watched them in order of release.

06:55.920 --> 07:00.920
So back in the day, TNG, DS9, and Voyager all came out at the same time, like overlapping.

07:00.920 --> 07:01.920
Yeah.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.920
So we actually watched the episodes overlapping the way they came out.

07:03.920 --> 07:04.920
Yeah.

07:04.920 --> 07:05.920
Because I had never done that before.

07:05.920 --> 07:06.920
That was a fun experience.

07:06.920 --> 07:07.920
Yeah, that was interesting.

07:07.920 --> 07:08.920
Yeah.

07:08.920 --> 07:09.920
Yeah.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.920
Going back and forth between like different casts and having to keep them all in our heads.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.920
Well, yeah, but also like being able to like get the story slightly better than being like,

07:15.920 --> 07:17.520
instead of instead of like watching like...

07:17.520 --> 07:18.520
There was crossovers between.

07:18.520 --> 07:22.920
Yeah, because there was crossovers like in later seasons and instead of being able to

07:23.320 --> 07:26.320
like watching an entire series and watching the next one and being like, oh, who was that

07:26.320 --> 07:27.320
person?

07:27.320 --> 07:28.320
Why is this crossover relevant?

07:28.320 --> 07:29.320
Yeah.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.320
You actually...

07:30.320 --> 07:31.320
You got it.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.320
...understand why it's relevant.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.320
Yeah.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.320
I know Julian Bashir from DS9 was guest starring on TNG for one episode.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.320
Was he?

07:37.320 --> 07:38.320
Yep.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.320
He was like doing...

07:39.320 --> 07:40.320
I remember it on Data.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.320
Oh.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.320
Yeah.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.320
I don't remember that.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.320
It was like in season six or something.

07:44.320 --> 07:45.320
I don't remember this.

07:45.320 --> 07:48.320
I remember when Will came to DS9 for like a day.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.320
Will?

07:49.320 --> 07:50.320
Riker.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.320
Oh, but it was actually Thomas Riker?

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
Oh, yeah.

07:53.720 --> 07:54.720
That's right.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.720
Yeah.

07:55.720 --> 07:56.720
It was the duplicate.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.720
But then also...

07:57.720 --> 07:58.720
Spoilers.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.720
Spoilers.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.720
The guy who made the EMH in Voyager came to DS9 for a day too.

08:02.720 --> 08:03.720
It's been too long.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.520
I have to watch them all again, so I fully remember all these references.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.520
Yeah.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.520
We haven't watched DS9 in like three or four years.

08:08.520 --> 08:09.520
Yeah.

08:09.520 --> 08:10.520
It's been a while.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.520
Yeah.

08:11.520 --> 08:12.520
Jesus.

08:12.520 --> 08:13.520
It's because we keep watching new bad Trek.

08:13.520 --> 08:18.520
So the idea was we were going to go through the entire Star Trek canon in order of release.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.600
So we go through all the shows, you go through Enterprise, and then I'm like, okay, Naomi,

08:21.880 --> 08:22.880
here's...

08:22.880 --> 08:23.880
We also watched the movies as well.

08:23.880 --> 08:24.880
Yeah.

08:24.880 --> 08:25.880
We did watch the movies.

08:25.880 --> 08:26.880
Like all the various like TNG movies, original series movies.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.880
Yeah.

08:27.880 --> 08:30.000
Then we get to the reboots, we watch the reboots, and they're like, well, they're not very good.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
But they're okay.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.560
And I'm like, okay, Naomi, here's where it gets bad.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.240
Now we're gonna start watching Discovery.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.240
And Naomi's like...

08:35.240 --> 08:37.240
And here's the thing, okay?

08:37.240 --> 08:43.640
It's like Discovery season one, like, there was a skeleton of a decent show, but they

08:43.640 --> 08:45.600
needed to do it completely differently, and they just didn't do it.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.600
Also the Klingons.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.600
Yeah.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.600
In the beginning.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.600
That was bad.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.600
The Trump Klingons.

08:50.600 --> 08:56.880
But like there was... if you just told me a bare bones synopsis of Star Trek Discovery

08:56.880 --> 09:00.760
season one, I'd be like, that could be good, but it wasn't because they did everything

09:00.760 --> 09:01.760
wrong.

09:01.760 --> 09:02.760
Yeah.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.760
But also...

09:03.760 --> 09:04.760
Same with season two, actually.

09:04.760 --> 09:05.760
Season two was better than season one, in fact.

09:05.760 --> 09:06.760
Yeah.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.440
But Discovery is a good science fiction show.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.240
It's not a good Star Trek show.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.240
Not a Star Trek show.

09:12.240 --> 09:16.440
Like it's better now in the later seasons where we're actually...

09:16.440 --> 09:17.440
In the future.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.440
In the future, like attempting to re... spoilers.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.440
Attempting to rebuild...

09:21.440 --> 09:22.440
Civilization?

09:22.440 --> 09:23.440
Because it all fell apart?

09:23.440 --> 09:24.440
No.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.440
Well, not civilization, but rebuild the...

09:25.440 --> 09:27.440
Well, I've forgotten all of my words.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.440
The Federation?

09:28.440 --> 09:29.440
Thank you.

09:29.440 --> 09:30.440
Jesus Christ.

09:30.440 --> 09:31.440
Yes, it is early in the morning for Naomi.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.440
Holy fuck.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.440
Drink some more of that coffee over there.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.440
Why don't you?

09:34.440 --> 09:35.440
I'm going.

09:35.440 --> 09:36.440
I've already half done.

09:36.440 --> 09:37.440
It's not helping.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.440
Okay.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.280
So Star Trek Discovery season one was not very good.

09:40.280 --> 09:45.040
Star Trek Discovery season two was better, but I think it was just... looking back on

09:45.040 --> 09:46.040
that.

09:46.040 --> 09:49.800
I think it was just for the fan service because you had Captain Pike, you had Spock.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.800
You know, just having...

09:50.800 --> 09:51.800
You had number one come back.

09:51.800 --> 09:52.800
Yeah.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.800
You know, I think...

09:53.800 --> 09:54.800
And you had the Enterprise.

09:54.800 --> 09:55.800
The original Enterprise.

09:55.800 --> 09:56.800
Yeah.

09:56.800 --> 09:57.800
I think it was all just fan service for season two.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.440
Season three was like...

09:59.440 --> 10:00.440
That's when we went to the future?

10:00.440 --> 10:01.440
Yeah.

10:01.440 --> 10:02.440
They went to the future.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.440
Right.

10:03.440 --> 10:04.440
Yes.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.440
That's where it started getting better.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.440
Yeah.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.440
Yeah.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.440
And season three and season four are now like...

10:08.440 --> 10:09.440
mediocre.

10:09.440 --> 10:17.080
It's about as good as like a slightly bad episode of Voyager, which is still pretty

10:17.080 --> 10:18.880
bad, but it's better than it has been.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.160
No, I don't know.

10:21.160 --> 10:24.720
I think they're on par with like a mediocre episode of Voyager.

10:24.720 --> 10:28.080
You know, like not a specifically bad episode, but like a mediocre episode, you know?

10:28.080 --> 10:29.080
Yeah.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.080
Okay.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.080
Like, yeah, I watched it and it was, you know, it was okay.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.080
You know.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.200
You know, we watched Lower Decks, which is just a comedy show and it's funny for a comedy

10:34.200 --> 10:35.200
show.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.200
Yeah.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.840
Lower Decks is like actually pretty good, but it's like... it's a comedy show.

10:38.840 --> 10:39.840
It's strictly comedy.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.840
Yeah.

10:40.840 --> 10:41.840
And you have to know all the Star Trek references.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.080
You're like, oh, Tom Parrish was up in this episode.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.080
Yeah.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.600
Like you have to have seen all of Star Trek to get it, but for what it is, it's good.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.600
Yeah.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.600
I really enjoy Lower Decks.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.600
Yeah.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.800
If you haven't seen all of Star Trek, you're not gonna really like it that much.

10:51.800 --> 10:52.800
No.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.720
And like, it's very specifically like, yes, this is part of the Star Trek universe, but

10:56.720 --> 11:02.240
it's also like, here's a shit ton of fan service and like just goof about the Star Trek universe.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.240
Yeah.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.240
But it's good.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.240
I enjoyed it.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.920
And of course, we mentioned the Orville briefly because the Orville is literally just TNG

11:07.920 --> 11:08.920
again.

11:08.920 --> 11:09.920
And I can kind of enjoy that.

11:09.920 --> 11:10.920
Yeah.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.920
I mean, I will say I do.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.520
Okay, guys, I really, really like the Orville and this is probably going to be shown as

11:14.520 --> 11:16.920
a bad take, at least according to things I've seen online.

11:16.920 --> 11:17.920
Yeah.

11:17.920 --> 11:18.920
Yeah.

11:18.920 --> 11:26.360
But I, in the latest season of the Orville, I miss the comedy that was in season one.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.360
Yeah.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.520
Season three, like I think Seth MacFarlane was like, I can do a real show now.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.520
It's like, no, it's supposed to be a comedy.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.520
It's a parody.

11:31.520 --> 11:32.520
You gotta chill the fuck out.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.520
It's a parody.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.520
But he wanted to try and make it like a real show.

11:34.520 --> 11:40.280
The thing is, I still like it, but I actually really miss all the comedy in season one because

11:40.280 --> 11:45.560
now it just feels like a generic Star Trek adjacent.

11:45.560 --> 11:46.560
You know?

11:46.560 --> 11:48.040
I'm not saying it's a bad show.

11:48.040 --> 11:54.080
I just, I felt like it was more unique when it was more, not like, yeah, it was a parody,

11:54.080 --> 12:03.480
but it didn't specifically mention Star Trek things, but it was a unique, this is obviously

12:03.480 --> 12:05.200
a Star Trek reference show.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.200
They can't see you with your hands.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.200
I don't care.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.200
This is for me.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.200
Naomi is dressing with her hands right now.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.520
It's for me to help me focus, goddammit.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.520
Okay, tell me about it.

12:13.520 --> 12:19.480
It didn't specifically comment that it was a Star Trek show.

12:19.480 --> 12:20.480
You know?

12:20.480 --> 12:24.760
It just like, if you've seen Star Trek and you watch the show, you're just like, oh yeah,

12:24.760 --> 12:27.520
this is kind of like Star Trek, but with a lot more comedy.

12:27.520 --> 12:32.960
And I felt that it was, it was very unique for, but now in the latest season, I'm just

12:32.960 --> 12:37.780
like, this is mildly boring and I'm not laughing as nearly as much as I did, you know?

12:37.780 --> 12:39.120
But it's still a good show.

12:39.120 --> 12:43.760
I just miss what it was, but I understand wanting to move on from that.

12:43.760 --> 12:44.760
I just wish-

12:44.760 --> 12:45.760
Yeah, they shouldn't have.

12:45.760 --> 12:46.760
They shouldn't have.

12:46.760 --> 12:47.760
I just wish they didn't.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.760
That's just my personal opinion.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.760
I'm sure a lot of the commenters aren't going to like it, but that's okay.

12:51.760 --> 12:55.120
No, I'm pretty sure that I'll actually agree with you if they have a brain.

12:55.120 --> 12:59.740
So listen, listen, to quickly go through this then, because we're getting bogged down.

12:59.740 --> 13:01.840
We watched Star Trek Prodigy, which is the kid's show.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.840
It's good for a kid's show.

13:03.840 --> 13:04.840
It's written for children.

13:04.840 --> 13:05.840
It's a children's show.

13:05.840 --> 13:09.960
If you like Star Trek and you don't like shows written for children, don't watch it.

13:09.960 --> 13:10.960
Yeah.

13:10.960 --> 13:11.960
But you know what?

13:11.960 --> 13:14.820
It's basically set up so that if you're a parent and you're a longtime Trek fan and

13:14.820 --> 13:18.280
you want to get your kids into Star Trek, what you could do is you could sit down, watch

13:18.280 --> 13:19.380
this with your kids.

13:19.380 --> 13:21.920
They're going to enjoy it as a kid's show and you're going to enjoy all the, all the

13:21.920 --> 13:25.780
lore references because Janeway comes back, Chakotay comes back.

13:25.780 --> 13:26.780
They have like-

13:26.780 --> 13:27.780
Comes back.

13:27.780 --> 13:28.780
Spoilers.

13:28.780 --> 13:32.940
The Cindy's show up for a little bit, you know, the, the Tellarites show up for a little

13:32.940 --> 13:33.940
bit.

13:33.940 --> 13:34.940
Yeah.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.220
There's, there's a bunch of lore that's built into the show.

13:37.220 --> 13:40.460
And there's a lot more aliens, so that's neat.

13:40.460 --> 13:41.460
Yeah.

13:41.460 --> 13:42.460
Yeah.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.020
We watched Strange New Worlds.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.540
That was the, the Christopher Pike box show.

13:46.540 --> 13:47.540
It's so good.

13:47.540 --> 13:48.540
It's okay.

13:48.540 --> 13:49.860
Well, there's still some serious problems with it.

13:49.860 --> 13:50.860
Okay.

13:50.860 --> 13:51.860
I don't care.

13:51.860 --> 13:52.860
You know what?

13:52.860 --> 13:53.860
After watching Picard.

13:53.860 --> 13:54.860
Okay.

13:54.860 --> 13:55.860
So it's such a good show.

13:55.940 --> 14:02.420
Strange New Worlds is, it is actually kind of a delight just because it is Trek again.

14:02.420 --> 14:06.620
Now it still has the Marvel quips that I'm kind of getting tired of at this point and

14:06.620 --> 14:15.780
being in fucking everything, but they had self-contained one episode stories, you know,

14:15.780 --> 14:17.340
they had like their villains of the week.

14:17.340 --> 14:20.420
They had their going around, going to different plants, having adventures.

14:20.420 --> 14:24.280
They structured it like an actual Star Trek show.

14:24.760 --> 14:30.040
You have characters that we know like Christopher Pike and Spock and number one, Christopher

14:30.040 --> 14:31.040
Pike.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.280
The actor is way too hot.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.800
Listen, you were also into Spock when we first met.

14:34.800 --> 14:35.800
Remember?

14:35.800 --> 14:36.800
Yeah.

14:36.800 --> 14:37.800
You just like all of them.

14:37.800 --> 14:38.800
You fucking, you Horno.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.800
Yeah.

14:39.800 --> 14:40.800
You like all the girls too, I bet.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.800
Yeah.

14:41.800 --> 14:42.800
Do you like Ortega?

14:42.800 --> 14:45.080
The girl with like the short hair on the sides?

14:45.080 --> 14:46.080
Probably.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.080
Yeah.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.080
Honestly.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.520
I don't remember anyone's name is anymore from anything.

14:49.520 --> 14:53.760
I know that you like the fucking blue GF girl from Lower Decks.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.760
Yeah.

14:55.760 --> 14:58.760
Because you just want a blue girl.

14:58.760 --> 14:59.760
Yeah.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.040
Blue is my favorite color.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.760
How can I not want a girl who's blue?

15:03.760 --> 15:05.760
I'll take the man who's blue too.

15:05.760 --> 15:06.760
Yeah.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.760
Oh, the one that was blind?

15:08.760 --> 15:09.760
Well, no.

15:09.760 --> 15:10.760
I mean, just a blue man.

15:10.760 --> 15:11.760
Oh, you're ableist.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.760
Oh my God, Naomi.

15:13.760 --> 15:17.920
Ableist and racist because he was an Aenar, so all of his race is blind.

15:17.920 --> 15:18.920
It's part of his race.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.180
I can't fucking believe you, Naomi.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.800
How terrible of a person are you?

15:22.840 --> 15:23.840
Wasn't he Andorian?

15:23.840 --> 15:26.840
He was just a sub race of the Andorians?

15:26.840 --> 15:28.840
Yeah, the Aenar are all blind.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.840
That's not being racist.

15:31.840 --> 15:35.340
Listen, if a quality of your race is that you can't see and then you're like, I don't

15:35.340 --> 15:36.840
like people who can't see, you're being racist towards them.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.840
I didn't say I don't like people who can't see.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.840
I just said I don't want to date someone who can't see.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.840
Naomi.

15:41.840 --> 15:42.840
Oh, wow.

15:42.840 --> 15:43.840
Listen, if you wouldn't-

15:43.840 --> 15:44.840
Fine.

15:44.840 --> 15:45.840
You know what?

15:45.840 --> 15:46.840
If you go blind, I'm dumping you.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.840
In 2023, if you wouldn't date a trans woman, you're a transphobics.

15:47.840 --> 15:51.400
Therefore, if you wouldn't date a blind person, you're blindphobic.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.400
That's how it works.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Fine.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
If you wouldn't date a Muslim, you're Islamophobic, too.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Okay.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Fine.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
You're just like, gigachad, yes.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
Fine.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
I'll take it.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Okay.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
Fine.

16:04.000 --> 16:10.360
But anyway, Strange New Worlds, good show, as close to as close to old Star Trek as Ugan.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.360
Yeah.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.360
And enjoyable.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.360
After Discovery.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.360
Yeah.

16:14.360 --> 16:17.800
So basically, in Discovery season two, the main cast goes off to the future.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.480
The side cast stays behind.

16:19.480 --> 16:24.440
And then season one of Strange New Worlds continues with the side cast story with Pike

16:24.440 --> 16:25.440
and Spock.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.440
Yes.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.440
Because they are the side cast of Discovery season two.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.440
Yes.

16:28.440 --> 16:32.160
So basically, all the new Star Trek shows have never really hit the heights of good

16:32.160 --> 16:33.760
TNG or good DS9.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.960
They've never gotten there.

16:35.960 --> 16:36.960
But-

16:36.960 --> 16:37.960
Strange New Worlds is the closest.

16:37.960 --> 16:38.960
It's the closest.

16:38.960 --> 16:44.720
And Strange New Worlds is as good as, in my opinion, an average episode of TNG.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.240
Yeah, which is really good.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.240
Which is still pretty good.

16:47.680 --> 16:55.760
You know, Discovery is now like a mediocre episode of Voyager, which is not as good.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.840
It's watchable, but it's not as good.

16:57.840 --> 17:01.960
And then the other shows are all like gimmicks, because the kid show, the cartoon show, you

17:01.960 --> 17:02.960
know.

17:02.960 --> 17:03.960
Then you have Picard.

17:03.960 --> 17:06.080
And then you have Picard.

17:06.080 --> 17:08.640
We finally got there, like 20 minutes or whatever later.

17:08.640 --> 17:09.640
Okay.

17:09.640 --> 17:10.640
Well, you know what?

17:10.640 --> 17:11.640
The Star Trek universe is a large-

17:11.640 --> 17:12.640
It's large.

17:13.080 --> 17:14.080
Because-

17:14.080 --> 17:17.500
Da da da da da da da da.

17:17.500 --> 17:18.500
Okay.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.500
Da da da da da da.

17:20.500 --> 17:30.160
So, they set up in Discovery season three, a storyline where Empress Georgiou goes back

17:30.160 --> 17:31.620
in time.

17:31.620 --> 17:33.220
Do you recall?

17:33.220 --> 17:34.220
Yes.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.400
And she leaves the show.

17:35.400 --> 17:39.480
And that's supposed to be the setup for a section 31 show because she's going to be

17:39.480 --> 17:40.480
the star of it.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.480
Yeah.

17:41.480 --> 17:47.000
So far that hasn't happened yet. And the reason that it hasn't happened is because Paramount only,

17:47.560 --> 17:53.080
they set aside a budget for five shows at once. They're only making five Star Trek shows at once.

17:54.040 --> 18:00.040
And the Christopher Pike and Spock, like first of all, all their shows have fucking failed and

18:00.040 --> 18:06.760
sucked. But fans loved Pike and Spock so much in Discovery Season Two, they were like, everyone

18:06.760 --> 18:10.520
on the internet was like, give these guys their own show, make a show, make a show, make a show,

18:10.520 --> 18:14.680
and they're like, oh my god, everything about our show suck. No one likes anything,

18:14.680 --> 18:17.960
we have to do something. And then I'm sure someone at Paramount was like, okay, fucking

18:18.520 --> 18:22.440
this is the only thing anyone likes, make this show. So they're like, okay, if we're making

18:22.440 --> 18:26.520
Strange New Worlds, we've got to preempt a show. What are we doing? We can't preempt Discovery,

18:26.520 --> 18:30.440
it's the flagship. We can't preempt Picard, because we just spent like a billion dollars

18:30.440 --> 18:35.160
getting Patrick Stewart back. So I guess we'll just cancel the section 31 one.

18:36.040 --> 18:40.280
So basically, what they did was until Picard is done, because they only have Patrick Stewart for

18:40.760 --> 18:48.120
three seasons. They shelved section 31. That show's not happening till Picard is done. And then it

18:48.120 --> 18:54.120
will take the Picard slot. So instead of what might be an okay show in section, we don't know,

18:54.120 --> 18:59.880
we don't know. Georgiou is fucking baller. Yeah, she's pretty fun. She's a badass bitch and I love

18:59.880 --> 19:03.320
her. But like the other characters from section 31 that they introduced back in the Discovery

19:03.320 --> 19:09.240
era were not very interesting. Picard is like the albatross hanging around the entire Star Trek

19:09.240 --> 19:18.120
franchise because Picard's season one and two. They're not just bad Star Trek. They're bad TV.

19:18.120 --> 19:24.200
They are I think the worst TV I've ever seen. No, I can't think of anything worse. Like they're

19:24.200 --> 19:28.760
I feel like there's probably shows we haven't watched that are worse. You've never seen Heroes,

19:28.760 --> 19:32.680
right? Uh, I saw some of it like season one or two. Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. Like

19:32.680 --> 19:37.160
afterwards. I don't know because I haven't seen it. But that's what the internet says. So I have

19:37.160 --> 19:45.880
to believe them. Fair enough. The worst episode of, you know, pre Alex Kurtzman Trek was probably

19:45.880 --> 19:50.120
Voyager's threshold where they go faster than warp 10 and then like turn into salamanders.

19:50.120 --> 19:55.240
Yeah, that was a weird episode. That was like abysmally bad. Yeah, that was very bad. That was

19:55.240 --> 20:01.560
a weird episode. And Picard is like, it's not just slightly it's not on par. It's worse than

20:01.960 --> 20:08.040
it's not just slightly worse. It is significantly worse. Like Picard. Picard goes from like,

20:08.040 --> 20:13.320
like you can't even laugh at how bad it is. No, we tried. It didn't work. Naomi,

20:13.320 --> 20:17.640
you watched it and you legitimately got went into a depression. Yeah. Like I

20:18.360 --> 20:23.080
wait. It was the last episode of season two or one. I don't remember. What happened in it?

20:23.080 --> 20:29.880
I don't remember. Half of this is like just going out of my brain as I'm saying it.

20:29.880 --> 20:34.040
Once season three of Picard is done and Patrick Stewart is safely in the fucking grave.

20:34.600 --> 20:38.200
I'm going to like, I'm sure he'll die immediately after this. If anything, keep him alive is the

20:38.200 --> 20:46.200
Star Trek books. But like, as soon as yeah, Naomi, as soon as the show is done, I'm going to do like

20:46.200 --> 20:52.360
a big review like I did with Obi-Wan Kenobi for Picard because like of everything, because it's

20:52.360 --> 20:59.160
so bad. It's so bad. But I did. I like legitimately just felt fucking depressed at how terrible this

20:59.160 --> 21:02.680
show was. And I just like laid in bed for the rest of the day being like, nope, I'm done with

21:02.680 --> 21:08.360
humanity. Yep. You were like, it actually like shut you down for a day because Jesus. Yeah. So

21:08.360 --> 21:14.920
bad. Like Picard season one, they ruined Picard himself. Yeah. They ruined Data. They ruined the

21:14.920 --> 21:19.640
Borg. They ruined the Romulans. They ruined. Yes, they did. They didn't ruin the Borg till season

21:19.640 --> 21:24.520
two. Nope. They had the, they had the artifact that, that reclaimed Borg cube in the middle of

21:24.520 --> 21:29.800
Romulan space they were working on. They ruined the Borg. They were in the Romulans. They ruined

21:29.800 --> 21:36.520
seven of nine. They introduced a bunch of new characters only to ruin them. So Jurati was

21:36.520 --> 21:44.200
terrible. Rios was terrible. He was more ruined in season two than season one, but he still was

21:44.200 --> 21:50.920
interesting. No. Oh, actually I read online. So the shit, sorry, if her season three, the ship that

21:51.320 --> 21:57.560
um, drug, drug girl, whatever, Rammy, Raffi, Raffi. I don't know why I keep calling her

21:57.560 --> 22:02.120
Remy. I don't know either. Is there, do you know her like a Remy? Remy sounds like a familiar name.

22:02.120 --> 22:07.000
I don't know a Remy, but there's definitely been a Remy in some sort of media I've been consuming

22:07.000 --> 22:12.120
recently. Oh, it's house. It's house. That's right. Yep. Did you notice that Raffi was in

22:12.680 --> 22:17.880
Rios's old ship? Yeah. Guess what? That's not supposed to be Rios's ship. What?

22:18.520 --> 22:23.480
They're there. No, no, no. They're reusing the same set, but it's a different ship,

22:23.480 --> 22:27.480
but you have to make it look different. It looks the same. It's not Rios's ship.

22:28.760 --> 22:35.400
Moving on, moving on. How angry with that. I'm annoyed. Okay. They fucked like Elnor was a big

22:35.400 --> 22:40.120
fucking waste. The Romulan, the Romulan Ninja. Okay. I want to point out that you're talking

22:40.120 --> 22:44.760
about season one and like most of these characters got more ruined in season two. Season two was

22:44.760 --> 22:49.720
worse than season one was. Yeah, I'm just going, okay, so here, here, fine, fine, fine. I'll

22:49.720 --> 22:54.680
rewind it then. Fuck. All right. Here's everything that Star Trek Picard ruined in seasons one and

22:54.680 --> 22:59.720
two. Okay. Picard and his relationships to the entire old cast by replacing with a new cast that

22:59.720 --> 23:03.960
all suck. All the new characters that were added were introduced. They were terrible. And then they

23:03.960 --> 23:08.760
were ruined over the course. Like they were made even worse. So Jurati was terrible. Raffi was

23:08.760 --> 23:14.760
terrible. Fucking Rios was terrible. Elnor was terrible. They ruined Seven of Nine. They ruined

23:14.760 --> 23:20.360
Seven of Nine's relationship with Janeway by basically like, like she just, she does so many

23:20.360 --> 23:24.440
things that are like completely against her character arc in Voyager. It's like, remember

23:24.440 --> 23:30.360
when she goes and like gets revenge for Icheb's fucking murder. Yeah. And like, he just has like

23:30.360 --> 23:37.560
a gruesome murder for no fucking reason. Other than because the, the actor that played Icheb

23:37.560 --> 23:43.240
back in the 90s spoke out against, there was some drama that he spoke out against and the,

23:43.240 --> 23:47.960
and the, and the Star Trek company like turned on him for it because it was against another actor

23:47.960 --> 23:51.240
and the, it was, it was, I don't know the full details. If I ever make a, if I ever make a big

23:51.240 --> 23:55.400
video, I'll get the details. But like, I do recall it was fucking stupid. All right. And they just

23:55.400 --> 23:59.080
pedally like had his character ripped apart for no fucking reason. They, they ruined the Borg. They

23:59.080 --> 24:04.760
ruined the Borg Queen specifically by making fucking, that was really bad. Yeah. They made,

24:04.760 --> 24:11.560
they made Jurati. So back in time, in the second season, in the second season, they're in 2024,

24:11.560 --> 24:17.880
Jurati becomes the board queen. Yep. She then survives all the way through TNG and Voyager.

24:17.880 --> 24:23.480
And it's like, hold on. So Jurati was in charge of, yeah. So the whole, why, what, why did you

24:23.480 --> 24:29.000
get, if Jurati was on our side the whole time, why did she do all that shit? It was so bad. No,

24:29.000 --> 24:33.080
no, no. They time traveled back. Remember? No, no, no, no. I think the Borg did. Yeah,

24:33.080 --> 24:38.360
they did too. No, they didn't. You sure? No. What happened was Jurati took Rios' ship,

24:38.360 --> 24:46.920
which by the way, Rios' ship is now gone. Oh yeah. But they took Rios', she took Gios' ship

24:46.920 --> 24:52.120
and then she flew off to the Borg Collective to become its queen. Yeah. Make the Borg good.

24:52.120 --> 24:57.000
And so. Make the Borg good. And basically over the next however many years it has been.

24:57.640 --> 25:01.160
Yeah. She gets to the Collective, she takes over, she becomes the queen.

25:01.560 --> 25:08.520
The issue is that in the actual timeline, the Borg attacked Earth several times,

25:09.400 --> 25:13.160
the Borg attacked Voyager several times, the Borg assimilated 709's family, like the Borg

25:13.160 --> 25:16.520
did all this terrible shit and Jurati was apparently at the head of it the whole time.

25:17.640 --> 25:24.120
Why? None of it makes sense. None of it makes sense. I swear. They ruined Q. Oh God. Yeah,

25:24.120 --> 25:28.200
that was. They fucking ruined Q. That was unfortunate. They brought back Wil Wheaton

25:28.200 --> 25:32.760
for one like. That was stupid. When Wil Wheaton came back in season two,

25:32.760 --> 25:38.440
he looked like Wil Wheaton, not like Wesley Crusher. I was just like, hey, that's Wil Wheaton.

25:38.440 --> 25:43.960
And I was like, wait, who did he play again? Oh shit, that's right, it's Wesley. But he's not

25:43.960 --> 25:47.400
actually Wesley, he's just fucking Wil Wheaton. He's just Wil Wheaton and I was just like,

25:47.400 --> 25:52.360
he should have shaved. At least that, yeah. He should have like, not because the character

25:52.360 --> 25:57.400
can't grow up, but because we haven't seen the character since he was a teenager.

25:58.200 --> 26:03.240
So he should have shaved to make himself look younger. So and they they fuck. Oh yeah,

26:03.240 --> 26:09.240
they ruined like the Khan shit. Project Khan. Remember that? Oh yeah. Yeah. I think with the

26:09.240 --> 26:15.560
exception of the Dominion War, Picard season one and two touched on every single popular,

26:15.560 --> 26:23.160
beloved component of Star Trek lore and then raped it. All of it. All of it. And now it's all

26:23.160 --> 26:30.760
ruined. And also, there wasn't even any, it wasn't well acted, it wasn't well written.

26:30.760 --> 26:36.920
The characters weren't interesting. No. And there's so many plot holes. Where did that

26:36.920 --> 26:41.240
Romulan guy go? Which one? The villain at the end of season one. I don't even remember who

26:41.240 --> 26:46.040
the villain was. He was just like, he was locked up and he was like, I'm here to save the world.

26:46.040 --> 26:51.480
And then he just disappears from the show. He's never seen him again. Yep. Right? Okay,

26:51.720 --> 26:57.560
there's apparently another dimension full of synthetic life forms that can be called through

26:57.560 --> 27:06.760
a portal to destroy all biological life. Mass Effect style, by the way. Season one's dilemma,

27:06.760 --> 27:10.600
which was taken was straight from Mass Effect. It's the fucking Reapers. I want to point out

27:10.600 --> 27:15.800
that as we were watching it for the first time, Dev was just screaming, it's the fucking Reapers.

27:16.760 --> 27:21.480
Like throughout the entire episode. It was obvious. I know, but you were just

27:21.480 --> 27:26.280
yelling it at the TV throughout like the whole episode. Yep. And that's just,

27:26.280 --> 27:31.240
oh, they closed the portal, then it's unresolved. Okay. In season two, the entire setup for season

27:31.240 --> 27:37.320
two, the going back in time, Jiradi becomes the Borg queen. There's always like commentary about

27:37.320 --> 27:42.440
Trump and capitalism and fucking and like homelessness in LA and environmentalism. Oh

27:42.440 --> 27:48.920
my God. Everything in season two. And then they get back to the present. It turns out the whole

27:48.920 --> 27:57.000
endeavor was to reveal that Jiradi was actually the queen of the Borg and the Borg were there to

27:57.000 --> 28:01.800
help stop a random anomaly that was coming out of a portal. It was a big energy beam and they

28:01.800 --> 28:04.840
force it back in the portal and they close it. And then it's several ships and then it's done.

28:04.840 --> 28:11.400
Yeah. It was never explained and fucking Elnor dies. And then he's like, they hail their ship

28:11.400 --> 28:15.000
and then there's like, Elnor's like, I just woke up here on the other ship, dude. It's like,

28:15.000 --> 28:23.240
listen, you weren't even there before. You're a cadet. Like, listen, I'm going to have to do like

28:24.200 --> 28:29.720
a huge video on just how bad seasons one and two were. You're actually going to have to

28:29.720 --> 28:34.680
separate it into like at least three videos. They were the worst TV I've seen. Yeah. That

28:34.680 --> 28:39.400
was pretty bad. On a technical level, on a writing level, on an acting level, on a lore level, like

28:39.400 --> 28:43.640
everything was bad. Yeah. There was like, okay, here, you know what? They tug at the heartstrings

28:43.640 --> 28:49.480
in two scenes, one when Data dies, two when Q dies, when Q dies, when Q says goodbye. That's

28:49.480 --> 28:54.200
it. And you know what? The entire seasons were set up. Yeah. So you have to wade through just

28:54.200 --> 28:58.440
tons of bullshit. And they're like, you'll forget about it because you felt something when you saw

28:58.440 --> 29:03.080
a character that you remember from your childhood die. And it's like, I see what you're doing,

29:03.080 --> 29:10.120
but I'm not. That's fucking stupid. All right. Yep. Yep. Yep. So the thing is,

29:11.160 --> 29:14.200
what I'm getting at half hour in, I haven't gotten to the actual show we're talking about.

29:14.200 --> 29:18.120
Yeah. Well, we got to the actual show, which is not this season. What I'm getting at is that

29:18.120 --> 29:22.520
the cards season one and two were the worst TV I've ever seen in my life. Worst Trek,

29:22.520 --> 29:26.440
worst TV. They're both super bad. Worse than any movie that I've seen.

29:27.240 --> 29:31.080
Well, what about some of the bad movies? You know what? I'll sit down and watch

29:31.080 --> 29:36.440
Schizophrenia. I can laugh at it. I can't laugh it. No, but no. Okay. I'm gonna,

29:36.440 --> 29:40.280
I'll get a few laughs at a driller killer. Shout out to red letter media here with their best of

29:40.280 --> 29:45.960
the worst series. I'm sure that a few movies on there, they made it look good because we,

29:45.960 --> 29:49.480
they didn't, we didn't have to watch the full thing they did. I watched some of those movies

29:49.480 --> 29:53.000
though. I watched some of those movies and I enjoyed watching better ones. I enjoyed watching

29:53.000 --> 29:58.600
them more. Okay. I enjoyed watching them more than fucking Picard. Okay. Well, cause here's the

29:58.600 --> 30:04.440
thing, like a bad movie is sometimes it's funny bad. Sometimes a really bad movie is just boring.

30:04.440 --> 30:11.880
Okay. It's very rare that a show becomes like personally offensive. And that is what Picard is.

30:13.160 --> 30:16.520
It's worse than funny bad. Cause you can have a good time. It's worse than boring cause you're

30:16.520 --> 30:20.520
just bored. But now it's like, Oh, here's the thing that you love and we're going to ruin it

30:20.520 --> 30:26.680
actively. That makes it like so much worse. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty bad. It's really bad.

30:27.240 --> 30:31.480
So we get to, we get to season three of Picard and Naomi's like, I don't want to watch it.

30:31.480 --> 30:38.360
I don't want to fuck you. We watched it. No, you watched it first. And then you were just

30:38.360 --> 30:43.960
like, listen, it's not as bad as season two or season one or season two is worse though

30:44.600 --> 30:50.520
than season one. That's my baseline. So it's not as bad as your low line. It's not a base,

30:51.160 --> 30:55.880
whatever for now. It's the base. Cause I didn't realize that you can get lower than bedrock.

30:57.640 --> 31:03.960
So that was like, listen, it's not as bad. And I think that you're not going to like,

31:03.960 --> 31:09.400
hate yourself for watching this. And I was like, fine. And so we watched it together.

31:09.400 --> 31:12.680
And here's the thing. All right. Season three, episode one of Picard.

31:15.080 --> 31:20.840
It is about as bad as a bad episode of Voyager, which is now on par with discovery.

31:21.160 --> 31:27.640
And the thing is, it's still really bad, but it's not like,

31:27.640 --> 31:33.320
apocalyptically bad the way that Picard was. Yeah, no, I can't guys, my skew, my like,

31:33.320 --> 31:39.400
is a media bad now is very skewed by Picard. So like anything that's better than Picard,

31:39.400 --> 31:44.360
I'm just like, it's great. The fucking Rotten Tomatoes scores for Picard season

31:44.360 --> 31:49.080
three are through the roof. And I'm like, listen, listen, it's not a 90. It's not a 100. This is

31:49.080 --> 31:57.080
like a show that is like, maybe a 45. But that's far better than the zero. All right.

31:57.080 --> 32:03.160
So it's season one or two, like watching watching Picard, season three, episode one

32:03.160 --> 32:11.960
is kind of like watching Voyager threshold. And that it's really bad and really fucking stupid.

32:13.000 --> 32:18.280
But it could be so much worse. And you know what? Can I say my piece now?

32:18.360 --> 32:18.920
Yes, sure. Go ahead.

32:18.920 --> 32:23.560
Is that Will fucking Riker is like keeping that show together.

32:23.560 --> 32:24.280
He is, yeah.

32:24.280 --> 32:31.320
Will Riker is keep Will Riker with Picard that we haven't seen in so many years is what's

32:31.320 --> 32:34.200
what kept the episode going for me because I was just enjoying that.

32:34.200 --> 32:34.440
Yeah.

32:34.440 --> 32:37.320
That's all I was enjoying. I was just like, this is great. I miss Will Riker.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.600
Having them back together again.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.120
Yeah. Like he like...

32:40.120 --> 32:43.640
We get some Riker in Lord X. He's kind of fun in that too.

32:43.640 --> 32:47.240
Yeah. Will Riker is always fun everywhere he is. I like his character so much.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.200
I like that he's like old man grumpy Riker now. He's like, oh, my knees hurt. Fuck.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.320
I got to pee so much.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.720
Yeah, but like he's still his character.

32:55.720 --> 32:56.120
Yeah.

32:56.120 --> 32:57.800
Unlike Patrick Stewart.

32:58.440 --> 33:03.560
Yeah. So Will, like the guy who plays Will Riker. Fuck. What was his name?

33:03.560 --> 33:07.720
I entirely forget. I'm so sorry to the actor, but you were just Will Riker to me now.

33:11.640 --> 33:12.600
I'm not going to remember it.

33:12.600 --> 33:13.480
No, you're not.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.240
But you should edit it in.

33:15.240 --> 33:19.880
Yeah, well, the the the character is still Will Riker.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.720
Yeah. However, his old Will Riker.

33:21.720 --> 33:25.880
Yeah. But the issue is, and this is something that we saw in Picard season one and two,

33:25.880 --> 33:29.000
is that the character of Picard is no longer Captain Picard.

33:29.000 --> 33:30.360
Now it's just Patrick Stewart.

33:30.360 --> 33:34.840
Yeah. That's what it feels like, which is so it's so strange, too, because like.

33:36.920 --> 33:43.080
I loved Patrick Stewart before Picard, but he was one of my favorite actors, like I, I, I,

33:43.800 --> 33:47.960
unlike most people, because I watched them really young, I fucking love the X-Men movies,

33:47.960 --> 33:52.360
the old X-Men movies. I watched them as a kid, guys. I watched it as a kid. I was biased,

33:52.360 --> 33:56.280
but I thought I loved Patrick Stewart. And you know what? I also really liked

33:56.280 --> 34:01.240
Patrick Stewart in American Dead. This character was of Commander Bullock. So fucking funny.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.640
He was great. And now after watching Picard.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.320
Also, you saw him in TNG. That was good.

34:06.840 --> 34:07.320
Of course.

34:08.440 --> 34:11.560
What's funny is like all through the 90s, everyone was saying if you're going to do

34:11.560 --> 34:14.680
an X-Men movie, you have to get Patrick Stewart before they did it. Yeah.

34:14.680 --> 34:17.720
Yeah. To play Xavier, because, like, he's the perfect character. And he was. It was great.

34:17.720 --> 34:23.160
It was the perfect casting. And I'm just I'm so upset that I kind of hate him.

34:24.440 --> 34:27.480
I don't I don't actually hate Patrick Stewart. I'm just I'm just.

34:27.480 --> 34:31.880
Well, it's clear that, like, upset about this character is because of meddling by

34:31.880 --> 34:35.640
Patrick Stewart. Well, he's an executive producer now.

34:35.640 --> 34:38.520
And I think I think the reason they can even do the show is because they brought him in and he's

34:38.520 --> 34:45.240
like, I want to do everything my way. And they're like, OK, OK, Mr. Star. Yep. Yep.

34:45.240 --> 34:46.840
Also, I'm fucking 90.

34:47.400 --> 34:50.520
Yeah. Like you like you can tell that Patrick Stewart is like

34:50.520 --> 34:54.200
feeling his age now with the way he like moves on set and stuff.

34:54.200 --> 34:58.600
Yeah. Will Riker. He's he's pretty old, too. But he's like, I'm still good. Let's go.

35:01.800 --> 35:07.000
But OK, so I'm going to give you the quick overview of the plot of season three, episode one.

35:07.000 --> 35:13.240
OK, so it starts out Beverly Crusher. She's been away from she's cut off everyone for 20 years.

35:13.240 --> 35:16.200
She's talked to anyone. She's been off on her own ship doing something.

35:16.200 --> 35:19.720
We don't know what you don't know what yet, but she's being attacked. There's some weird

35:19.720 --> 35:23.400
aliens and masks. They come in with their guns, weird aliens that we can't understand

35:23.400 --> 35:29.640
through the universe translator. I don't know if it was a writing plot hole or if is significant.

35:29.640 --> 35:32.200
You know what it is? It's the fact that they're making an action show.

35:32.200 --> 35:34.840
That's it. They're making like a dumb action hour show. Yeah.

35:34.840 --> 35:38.200
So they come in, there's a firefight. And of course, you know, Beverly gets hit.

35:38.200 --> 35:42.520
She goes, I'm bleeding. She like shoots them. She incinerates one.

35:42.520 --> 35:46.840
It's a very normal, like sci fi action sequence. There's nothing really special about it.

35:46.840 --> 35:51.480
And then afterwards, she sends like a really overly dramatic coded message to Picard

35:51.480 --> 35:58.040
on a 20 year old translator or on his bed, on his old badge, which is clearly just like fan service.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.920
But it makes sense in that she doesn't want to be picked up by Starfleet. She's like,

36:00.920 --> 36:02.760
don't tell Starfleet I'm doing something secret out here.

36:03.560 --> 36:09.560
I can tell you either. Fuck you. Yeah. And so the message gets to Picard and Picard is back

36:09.560 --> 36:15.320
at the Chateau Picard. And he's like, you know what? Despite my entire character, even my entire,

36:15.320 --> 36:19.880
my entire characterization in seasons when I'm to a Picard, I'm going to sell everything

36:20.440 --> 36:24.200
and get rid of all my shit, including all those artifacts I've collected

36:24.200 --> 36:28.840
before he gets the message, by the way. Yeah. Before he gets even he's even like,

36:28.840 --> 36:32.920
man, this this flute that I got from the inner light, I just want to get rid of this thing.

36:34.840 --> 36:39.960
And his new girlfriend is like this Romulan housekeeper of his who was in season two.

36:39.960 --> 36:44.760
No, she's she wasn't a spy, but she was she was a spy for the Romans.

36:44.760 --> 36:48.600
Yeah, but wasn't she a shell? Shall we are tall?

36:48.600 --> 36:53.480
Tal Shiar. Fuck. You're a racist. I'm not racist. I forgot all the words to everything in the

36:53.480 --> 36:58.280
English language. She was an old Tal Shiar. But then after the Romans collapsed, she like ended

36:58.280 --> 37:01.880
up being a refugee and then she was she was just living at Picard's place. Yeah. OK, so.

37:03.800 --> 37:07.480
Yeah, yeah. Basically, at the end of season two, they've got a relationship. Yeah. And so

37:07.480 --> 37:13.080
also that Picard and Laris was her name there in this relationship and she's moving off to be some

37:13.080 --> 37:17.640
kind of diplomat on another planet. And Picard's like, I'll go with you. Is she? I didn't even.

37:17.640 --> 37:21.640
I know that's why they're moving. Oh, and Picard is like, you know what? Fuck it. I'll go with you.

37:21.640 --> 37:26.120
I want to abandon everything on my old life and get rid of all my old stuff. Give my old painting

37:26.680 --> 37:30.120
of the Enterprise to Geordi. I don't give a shit. I'm done with this stuff. I want to go have a new

37:30.120 --> 37:36.360
adventure with you, my new life partner for the few years I have left. Yeah. He didn't say that.

37:36.360 --> 37:41.080
Even though he's a robot, by the way, he's a robot. Oh, fuck. That's right. They should have

37:41.080 --> 37:46.280
just killed him at the end of season one and then put him put like put him into like a new body or

37:46.280 --> 37:55.000
something. You know, he's a robot. You forgot about that. I. Maybe forgot that they never

37:55.000 --> 37:58.920
mentioned it again. They never mentioned it again. But all throughout season two and season

37:58.920 --> 38:10.040
three, Picard's a robot now. OK, so they're going off. To have this this this new adventure,

38:10.040 --> 38:13.400
and then he gets the message and he's like, oh, and then she looks at it and she's like,

38:13.400 --> 38:19.640
OK, this looks legit. You got to go. And he goes off. He decides to go to ten forward,

38:19.640 --> 38:26.040
which, by the way, now after the season's two events, that was retcon to Guinan is she aged

38:26.040 --> 38:30.680
because she wanted to. Yeah, that was weird. That was such a weird explanation of that.

38:30.680 --> 38:36.440
Just wanted to explain what the Goldberg being like fat in her old age. It's always aged.

38:36.440 --> 38:40.360
Exactly. But here's the here's the issue, though. The issue. Yeah, that's right. They said that she

38:40.360 --> 38:45.800
was ageless. Yeah. Not that she was ageless, but that we saw her back in the eighteen hundreds and

38:45.800 --> 38:51.480
she looked the exact same as she did in the yeah, on the enterprise. Yeah, but that was also weird,

38:51.480 --> 38:57.320
too, because fucking they show like Guinan in twenty twenty four as being really bitter. And

38:57.320 --> 39:02.280
it's like that wasn't Guinan. And also, if they went back in time in TNG for Time's Arrow and

39:02.280 --> 39:06.840
had this this big adventure, why didn't Guinan mention the second adventure that they had

39:06.840 --> 39:14.520
together? It's so every all it's all focus on season one, season three focus. They all go to

39:14.520 --> 39:19.240
ten forward, which is now a bar in L.A. Nope. You said it was L.A.? It was San Francisco. Okay.

39:20.040 --> 39:28.920
It's now a bar in San Francisco. It was just named after deck ten forward. No, fuck. Yeah.

39:28.920 --> 39:32.920
But now it's like apparently it's like a street address, whatever. Okay. They go to the new ten

39:32.920 --> 39:36.840
four, which is actually the old pre enterprise ten forward that existed back in twenty fucking

39:36.840 --> 39:45.000
twenty four in San Francisco. And Picard meets Will Riker there. Yeah. And they look over

39:45.960 --> 39:50.280
and there's always like to try and smooth over how shit the show is. They always throw it through

39:50.280 --> 39:53.480
a few like little references. So they're like, oh, hey, Picard, you wouldn't remember this because

39:53.480 --> 39:58.440
you were you were still recovering from being being fucked up as the cutest. There was there

39:58.440 --> 40:02.040
was a storyline where like there was a computer virus on this. I'm pretty sure this actually

40:02.040 --> 40:07.080
happened. There's a computer virus in the enterprise and it added three to every single

40:07.080 --> 40:13.960
digit in the computer. Yeah. Because Picard couldn't figure out how to get the coordinates

40:13.960 --> 40:20.360
that Beverly had encoded into this transmission on his very old communicator because he didn't know

40:20.360 --> 40:28.120
because of age old history lore reference. Yeah. So Beverly says the name of the virus and Will's

40:28.120 --> 40:32.360
like, I know what that is. You don't, but I do. Yeah. And then adds three to every coordinate.

40:32.360 --> 40:35.320
It turns out it leads to a system outside of Federation space and like, we got to go.

40:35.320 --> 40:40.280
You got to go see what's going on out there. Yeah. So here comes the more stupidity. So this is

40:40.280 --> 40:45.960
the stupid part. So their plan is stupid part. Their plan is to go back to Will Riker's old ship

40:45.960 --> 40:51.080
that he hasn't been captain of in five years now of the Titan, the Titan. He goes back to the

40:51.080 --> 40:59.080
Titan. They pretend to be doing an inspection. For frontier day. This was also a lore reference.

40:59.080 --> 41:05.240
No. Pretty sure. Oh, you know what it was? It was 250 years after the start of enterprise where

41:05.240 --> 41:08.520
Jonathan Archer launched the NX-01. That's what it was. They didn't say it in the show,

41:08.520 --> 41:13.080
but that's what it is. I looked it up. So they're celebrating frontier day. There's going to be a

41:13.080 --> 41:19.320
parade. They're going to go inspect the ship. A space parade. Yep. They get there. Seven of nine

41:19.320 --> 41:23.240
is the second officer, first officer. Yeah. Which was very surprising. Like how did she,

41:23.240 --> 41:30.920
she just joined Starfleet? Well, apparently it's been a while since season two. It's been several,

41:30.920 --> 41:35.000
it's been several years. Yeah. Still only several years. They didn't say that, but yeah. Cause I

41:35.000 --> 41:39.240
think, see, I think seven of nine was like, I mean, this is, this is part of the lore rate

41:39.240 --> 41:43.240
by the way, because in season one, seven of nine was part of the Fenris Rangers, which is some

41:43.240 --> 41:47.960
organization they never fucking explain. It's she was literally just like a lone ranger. Yeah.

41:48.600 --> 41:52.440
And then in season two, she had joined Starfleet and she was like a Lieutenant or something. And

41:52.440 --> 41:56.840
now she's a commander. Oh, did she, was she in Starfleet in season two? Okay. I actually just

41:56.840 --> 42:01.880
forgot, but also this like makes slightly more sense then. Okay. In one year between season

42:01.880 --> 42:08.280
one and season two. All right. They have fucking. All right. Eleanor goes from Ninja to, what was

42:08.280 --> 42:14.600
that? Oh, it was you, Jesus Christ. Eleanor goes, goes from, Eleanor goes from Ninja to graduating

42:14.600 --> 42:18.840
a four year Academy in one, one and a half years or something ridiculous. He's amazing.

42:19.800 --> 42:25.960
You know, he's Legolas. You know, Kirk made a bet he could do it in three. Yeah. Yeah. And

42:25.960 --> 42:30.920
like that was considered a feat. Yep. And then Eleanor does it in 1.5. Yeah. Okay. Sure. All

42:30.920 --> 42:40.360
right. Rios who hates Starfleet is now a captain in Starfleet. Rejoins Starfleet. Rafi who was a

42:40.360 --> 42:44.840
drug addict who was out on the out rejoined Starfleet. She was already part of Starfleet.

42:44.840 --> 42:49.240
And then she just, well, so Rios was too. No, no, I know. But like Rafi, like Rios

42:50.200 --> 42:54.760
stopped because he hated it. Cause he was already a captain, right? I forget. I thought I kind of

42:54.760 --> 43:01.960
forget Rios, the story. I don't care for one. I remember he commanded a star ship. They got in

43:01.960 --> 43:06.680
a battle. He lost people. And he was like, fuck this. I'm out. And then Rafi was just having

43:06.680 --> 43:13.800
personal issues and she turned to drugs. Yeah. Seven of nine joins up. I mean,

43:13.800 --> 43:16.600
maybe like all the stuff she did under Janeway got her some extra credit or something,

43:16.600 --> 43:20.280
but I don't fucking know. She's she's now a Lieutenant. Well, she was also like,

43:20.280 --> 43:25.960
she's still smart. Like you don't see it in the show at all in Picard, but like Janeway

43:25.960 --> 43:29.640
seven and nine is like really, really smart because of all the Borg stuff. Right. So,

43:29.640 --> 43:37.720
um, and, and Jurati, despite being convicted for murder in season one, they hand that away

43:37.720 --> 43:41.640
in season two. They hand, they hand, they hand wave it away in season two by saying,

43:41.640 --> 43:47.800
Oh, I'm out in parole. Cause they need me for this job. I'm helping out. Yep. So stupid. So,

43:47.800 --> 43:52.520
but anyway, like, so all that shit changes in one year between season one and season two.

43:52.520 --> 43:55.720
Now between season two and season three is apparently several years, but I don't know

43:55.720 --> 43:59.640
how long it is exactly. But basically, seven of nine has been promoted. She's now a commander.

43:59.640 --> 44:05.880
She's first mate of the Titan of the Titan. Um, the show really wants to play up the captain of

44:05.880 --> 44:10.600
the Titan as an asshole. But he's actually correct. They, they really, like, I felt it.

44:10.600 --> 44:16.760
Like I was like, Oh, I hate this guy because I, cause like my brain was going TNG rules, TNG.

44:17.400 --> 44:22.200
Like I just kept going. So basically really want you to hate the captain, like really,

44:23.000 --> 44:26.600
Picard and Riker show up and they're like, we got to like sweet talk our way into like getting out

44:26.600 --> 44:31.560
to this, this, what is it called? The Rylak system or something? My brain is like, it was the Rio

44:31.560 --> 44:36.680
system. I think it was Rylas, Rylos. It doesn't matter. It's, it's a, it's a far away system

44:36.680 --> 44:40.440
inside of space. Starts with an R. We got to, we got to get, we got to sweet talk this guy into

44:40.440 --> 44:45.000
doing it. And the guy's like, you think I'm a fucking idiot? No. Like I, I read, I know who

44:45.000 --> 44:50.280
you guys are. You guys play loosey goosey with the rules. You're going to fucking try to get my ship.

44:50.280 --> 44:53.800
You're going to get me fucked up. You're going to get my crew fucked up. All right.

44:53.800 --> 44:57.560
Well, you're going to, the ship's going to get blown up or the fucking like, like, no,

44:57.560 --> 45:01.400
I'm going to follow the rules. Fuck you. Yeah. Like, but like, and he's correct.

45:01.400 --> 45:04.840
Yeah. He's actually correct. But said in a much more assholist way,

45:04.840 --> 45:08.680
like all the passive aggressiveness. Ashholist. Ash, Ashholist.

45:09.160 --> 45:09.660
Yeah.

45:13.960 --> 45:14.460
Go on.

45:15.240 --> 45:21.160
But like said in like the most passive aggressive way, without actually being blunt,

45:21.160 --> 45:25.400
like Dev just wasn't saying all that, you know? He was definitely being a dick towards them.

45:25.400 --> 45:28.360
Cause he was like, he knew something was up though. He's not an idiot.

45:28.360 --> 45:35.400
No. And, and, but also seven of nine hated his guts. That was the one thing I was just like, man.

45:35.400 --> 45:39.320
And also I think that if you guys, if you guys end up watching, I hope you guys don't watch

45:39.320 --> 45:45.240
season season, season three, episode one. But if you do, I actually think that the main reason

45:45.240 --> 45:55.320
that she hates region, I can't fucking talk. Let it go. Let it go. Yes. I think the main reason

45:55.320 --> 46:00.920
that she hates like the captain so much is that she shouldn't actually be a first officer.

46:00.920 --> 46:07.080
She should just be the, uh, no, like the, like head science officer. Yeah. Because that's what

46:07.080 --> 46:12.280
she was doing on a Voyager. She was an officer, but yeah. Yeah. But like, she was pretty much the

46:12.280 --> 46:16.120
head science officer, but come on. And, but like, she was great and really good at that. But now

46:16.120 --> 46:20.200
she's first officer and just hates her fucking job because she has to work immediately under

46:20.200 --> 46:23.960
a cabinet. She doesn't really like, um, just like, okay, so go do science stuff. Cause that's what

46:23.960 --> 46:31.160
made you happy. Yeah. You know, I don't know. Like it feels like it's just the whole thing of

46:31.160 --> 46:37.400
her character being very different, but there being no lead up to her being very different.

46:38.120 --> 46:41.880
So if you think about Voyager, it's like, well, that doesn't exist anymore.

46:42.920 --> 46:47.960
So here's the thing to actually get along with it, with the story though. Uh, so the sweet talking

46:47.960 --> 46:51.240
doesn't work. She doesn't work seven times. Like fuck it. And then they go there anyway.

46:51.240 --> 46:55.000
And then the captain is like, you know what? You just fucked yourself out of your career.

46:55.000 --> 47:01.720
And someone's like, yeah, I did. Um, Picard and Riker steal a shuttle. They fly out. They find

47:01.720 --> 47:09.160
Beverly ship. They dock, um, Beverly's like, by the way, I have another son. No. Okay. Beverly

47:09.160 --> 47:15.640
was unconscious in the ship and she was in a medical thing and this guy just randomly attacks

47:15.640 --> 47:22.840
Will and Picard. And it turns out that it's Beverly's son who knows who the dad is. I have

47:22.840 --> 47:27.400
a feeling it's probably Picard though. They didn't bang though. You sure? I'm pretty sure

47:27.400 --> 47:31.560
it's going to be retcon that they did right before she left. Okay. But basically this kid is old

47:31.560 --> 47:36.840
enough that he could be like 20 or 21, which means that they might've had it. It also could be the

47:36.840 --> 47:41.560
case that she had the kid after they split up. I am 100% telling you right now that it's going to

47:41.560 --> 47:51.160
be Picard's kid who, and part of the reason that she left is because they had like a, like a,

47:51.160 --> 47:56.040
we're going to get back together, bang. And then they didn't and she left, but was pregnant. So

47:56.040 --> 47:59.880
they're just doing the exact story that they did with Kirk. Yes. Where Kirk had like a random son

47:59.880 --> 48:04.520
from like a scientist woman. 100% that's going to be. Do you think he's going to get killed like

48:04.520 --> 48:10.760
Kirk's son did? Maybe. Is this the same story? Maybe. Okay. Here's the thing though. What's

48:10.760 --> 48:15.480
really weird about it is that this kid has to be at least 20 years younger than Wesley.

48:15.480 --> 48:21.320
Yeah. Yeah. Like that's a, that's a weird feeling. It's like, wow. Imagine like having a sibling

48:21.320 --> 48:25.000
that is like 20 or 25 years older than you. Like, holy fuck. For a while I actually thought like,

48:25.000 --> 48:30.600
is this just going to be Wesley with like, like de-aged? Do you go with like a de-aging machine

48:30.600 --> 48:34.680
or did he like, did he get like, like plastic surgery done? He's like, no, it's probably a

48:34.680 --> 48:39.080
new kid. It's probably a new kid. 100%. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I don't think Wesley would have

48:39.080 --> 48:42.680
attacked Will like that. Though it would be good to see Wesley get bitch slapped.

48:44.280 --> 48:47.960
Cause Will just fucking smacks him. You mean Will Wheaton get bitch slapped? Yes.

48:49.560 --> 48:54.440
I like how whenever like Will Wheaton has a bad take on Twitter, people just spin him with,

48:54.440 --> 49:01.480
shut up Wesley. It's really fucking funny. Yeah. That's pretty funny. Funny. Yeah.

49:01.480 --> 49:06.680
Funnily. Funnily. Funnily funny. That's my name. Don't wear it out. But that's the end of the show

49:06.680 --> 49:14.760
because not Will Wheaton. Not Wesley Crusher is like, Hey, by the way, guys look out the window

49:14.760 --> 49:18.520
and they look out and it's like this giant fucking ship that's meant to be really intimidating. But

49:18.520 --> 49:23.640
I'm like, listen, we've seen this with the scimitar and it was at nemesis or insurrection. We've seen

49:23.640 --> 49:28.360
this with the, with the Romulan mining ship and the reboot. There's, there's been a lot of

49:28.360 --> 49:30.840
Star Trek villain ships where they come out of the nub and it's like,

49:30.920 --> 49:39.400
dah, dah, dah. And it's like a central pod with like a bunch of like spiky bits pointing forward

49:39.400 --> 49:44.360
off the sides to make it look like it's yeah. Yeah. And it's like, okay, I get it. You're

49:44.360 --> 49:48.120
trying to be intimidating, but we've seen this in Star Trek so many times now this exact fucking

49:48.120 --> 49:54.600
ship. It's like, okay. Yep. Didn't matter. Yeah. So like clearly this episode that's the end of the

49:54.600 --> 50:01.400
episode. Um, clearly the episode is meant to be, it's like a set up episode. We're not going to

50:01.400 --> 50:08.760
get any of these questions answered right away. Um, and it feels like they were the, uh, for,

50:08.760 --> 50:11.400
for this episode and the season, they're like, listen, we know we fucked up, dude,

50:11.400 --> 50:14.680
can you please just give us another chance? And the reason it feels like that is because

50:14.680 --> 50:20.920
one there's so many old lore call. Oh, wait, we forgot all about, uh, Raffi. Oh, that's right.

50:21.880 --> 50:27.640
Raffi has a completely, completely unconnected story. Yep. So Raffi is like an undercover

50:27.640 --> 50:32.760
officer somewhere, somewhere on some, on some like party planet. Cause every planet is just

50:32.760 --> 50:38.200
like the party planet or the ice planet or the city planet or whatever the bad city planet,

50:38.200 --> 50:43.080
the fire planet, where the bad Orion's hang out the desert planet. Yep. Yeah. So she's like

50:43.080 --> 50:48.200
undercover. She gets information about an incoming terrorist attack. Yep. And she's like, what the

50:48.200 --> 50:52.680
fuck does it mean, dude? And she's talking to like either an AI or a person with like a coded voice

50:52.680 --> 50:56.200
or something. No, no. She's, she's talking to a secret handler. That's what they said. Yeah.

50:56.200 --> 50:59.640
Cause she's part of Starfleet intelligence and Starfleet intelligence is like, doesn't want to

50:59.640 --> 51:03.800
reveal who they are to her. The handler doesn't because it's like, it's undercover. Right. Yeah.

51:04.680 --> 51:08.760
And Raffi is like, listen, dude, there's something, something big is going to happen. They, they,

51:08.760 --> 51:12.760
they stole this experimental portal technology. It's literally portals from the game portal.

51:12.760 --> 51:15.720
You open up two fucking portals. You can walk through it. It's like, that's what it is. All

51:15.720 --> 51:20.280
right. But it's really big. And she like flies into it's not earth. It's like a different planet.

51:20.280 --> 51:23.720
Yeah. And she flies, there's like a Federation like city on a different planet. And she flies

51:23.720 --> 51:27.800
down and she's like, guys, there's like a Starfleet base there. And she's like, listen,

51:27.800 --> 51:31.240
guys, you're going to get fucked. There's a terrorist attack incoming. I need to talk to

51:31.240 --> 51:36.120
someone like several times the words I need to talk to someone right now, like no Starfleet

51:36.120 --> 51:40.360
codes or anything. Just I'm screaming into the PA. I need to talk to someone. Because Raffi is

51:40.360 --> 51:45.560
fucking incompetent. Yeah. Always has been. Yeah. And then, and then she watches like a portal open

51:45.560 --> 51:51.160
up underneath the building and the entire building falls into the portal. Yeah. The portal opens

51:51.160 --> 51:56.120
right above the building to the right. Yeah. It's like, it's like one city block over. Yeah. So it

51:56.120 --> 52:00.920
doesn't even like, it's not even in another part of like the city, like somewhere like, especially

52:00.920 --> 52:07.240
like, Oh God, there's, there's an orphanage here. No, it's just like, Oh, and here's the

52:07.240 --> 52:12.040
building. And I was like, Oh, okay. And the building just like falls onto the street. Yeah.

52:12.040 --> 52:15.560
And like, it's, it's clearly like a big fucking disaster. There's probably a lot of people who

52:15.560 --> 52:19.560
died. There was a lot of screaming. Yeah. Yeah. But then, which is kind of funny because she's

52:19.560 --> 52:23.160
like, how did Raffi hear that? She's in her ship. She's above the city. She's like watching this.

52:23.160 --> 52:27.320
And you're also, even the camera's really far away from it. Like, but basically it was also,

52:27.320 --> 52:31.960
what would be screaming? They're all like dead. Well, the people around the people who didn't get

52:31.960 --> 52:35.480
squished. To be fair, I actually watched because I watched this episode twice, once on my own,

52:35.480 --> 52:39.240
once with you. And I watched like the second time through, I watched all the little cars

52:39.240 --> 52:43.560
driving around the city and like they did a decent job with detail because like cars that

52:43.560 --> 52:48.840
were approaching the disaster stopped and like cars that were on the way away, like sped up.

52:48.840 --> 52:53.880
I was like, they actually made it look like it was nice. Yeah. That was like their big

52:53.880 --> 52:59.320
effect shot for the episode. Yeah. I do always appreciate when, uh, the, a show will go like

52:59.320 --> 53:03.800
in depth and far away shots. Even, even if you don't notice them on a first watch, you notice

53:03.800 --> 53:06.840
them, you'll notice them on like a second or third and be like, Oh, that's neat. Like I,

53:07.640 --> 53:13.640
it does definitely boost points in the, how much do I like the show skill? Yeah. So this

53:13.640 --> 53:20.760
Starfleet outpost or whatever is destroyed and Rafi's like, Oh my God. Didn't she just start

53:20.760 --> 53:25.720
crying? Kind of. I don't remember. Kind of. Her reaction was very kind of blase. Well,

53:25.720 --> 53:29.000
she's not a very good actress to be honest. She's, she's talked about everything the entire show.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.920
No, listen, I actually think that the actress is pretty good. Oh yeah. It's just the character

53:32.920 --> 53:39.080
was really bad. Oh, okay. No, no. I legit like she, cause she's done good because like she isn't

53:39.080 --> 53:44.600
like, she isn't like a Kristen Stewart where like she just hasn't had any like facial changes or

53:44.600 --> 53:47.480
anything. Apparently she's actually a good actress too. It's just the Twilight sucked.

53:48.440 --> 53:53.400
No, because I saw her in, um, snow white. There, there was a snow white movie with

53:53.400 --> 53:57.880
Kristen Stewart as snow white. Yeah. Like it was, it was like a snow white, like not a parody,

53:57.880 --> 54:02.520
not cause of comedy, but like a shitty one. Sure. I don't even remember, but she was in that. I'm

54:02.520 --> 54:06.920
like, she's just doing the same thing with her face. Okay. Apparently though she has a new movie,

54:06.920 --> 54:11.160
I think about some, it has something to do with British royalty and she looks pretty good in that.

54:11.160 --> 54:15.640
I saw different emotions on her face and I was like, Oh shit. For the first time she experienced

54:15.640 --> 54:21.560
emotion. I'm sure she experienced most in other times, but like in, in the very few things I've

54:21.560 --> 54:26.680
seen her in, I haven't really seen her face change very much. Right. But anyway, like it's not the

54:27.480 --> 54:31.880
actress is not like doing that and she's not only just doing one thing, but she has different,

54:31.880 --> 54:38.360
like she has very hammy. Well, yeah, but like the characters hammy, you know, like this character

54:38.360 --> 54:45.400
is like a, like a semi crazed like drug addict who is not a drug addict at the moment, but at least

54:45.400 --> 54:49.560
was, you know, and it has like, it's fucked up her family life. It's fucked up her work life,

54:49.560 --> 54:57.880
like, and just like is very, very emotional person, emotional reacting person first.

54:57.880 --> 55:03.640
But I actually thought that her reaction to the, like the disaster, the disaster was very,

55:03.640 --> 55:08.200
just like, and tears because like she was just getting really frustrated with not being able

55:08.200 --> 55:13.320
to figure out like what was happening. The issue with, with Rafi's story is that it's completely

55:13.320 --> 55:17.800
disconnected and separate from the rest of the story. The moment it is, there's no crossover

55:17.800 --> 55:22.440
scenes. There's definitely going to be, of course there's, but like the main cast doesn't even

55:22.440 --> 55:27.080
mention Rafi. No one knows what she's doing. No one cares. Oh, you know what? I bet it is.

55:27.080 --> 55:31.720
I bet that the aliens who were attacking Beverly's ship are also the ones who have that

55:31.720 --> 55:36.760
portal technology. Yeah. That's going to be what the connection is. Yeah, probably. But anyway,

55:39.160 --> 55:47.400
the episode itself, not very good, but at least not offensively bad. No. Yeah. It's not as bad

55:47.400 --> 55:52.120
as Picard seasons one and two. And that's like high praise for this. That's why it's getting

55:52.520 --> 55:56.280
such high marks on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, also because everyone's like,

55:56.280 --> 56:01.480
Oh my God, everyone's back. Beverly crushers. Well, here's the thing. So they expelled all

56:01.480 --> 56:07.000
the cast of season one and two. Except for Rafi, Seven of Nine and Rafi. And Rafi's in a new

56:07.000 --> 56:12.520
character. What's her name? The housekeeper. Oh, Laris. Yeah, Laris and Laris. Those are the only

56:12.520 --> 56:15.560
three we see. And I have a feeling that Laris is also going to be out for the season. She's not

56:15.560 --> 56:19.400
going to show back up. No, of course she will. No. Me at the very end. Listen, she wasn't in

56:19.400 --> 56:24.680
season two at all. She was a different character. Yeah, but they still had the actress. Yeah, I

56:24.680 --> 56:27.880
know. But still it wasn't Laris. And in season one, she was there for half a season. Yeah,

56:27.880 --> 56:31.640
but that's because she had to protect Picard. Yeah. For a little bit. And she wasn't there

56:31.640 --> 56:38.120
that much. Just when he went back to the Chateau. She wasn't there that much. You're, I think. No,

56:38.120 --> 56:43.800
no, no. Because Picard spent like before he was in the Chateau for like four out of 10 episodes

56:43.800 --> 56:51.240
of season one. Yeah, well, that's because the robot girl, spoilers, you know, had to rest and

56:51.240 --> 56:55.480
heal and not be attacked. No, I know. There was reasons for it. But no, Laris was around for a

56:55.480 --> 56:59.320
good chunk of season one and she came back at the end of season one too. But no, here, let me, let

56:59.320 --> 57:06.680
me, let me put it this way. Let me put it this way, okay? All the characters were so annoying

57:06.680 --> 57:12.280
from season one and two. All the new characters. And they had, they basically had concluded all

57:12.280 --> 57:15.960
of their stories, even though the conclusions were terrible and the stories were terrible.

57:15.960 --> 57:20.840
They were done. So they just kicked all them out and they're like, fuck it. As I mentioned before,

57:20.840 --> 57:25.960
they really wanted this to be like the worst story show. So they brought back all the regulars from

57:25.960 --> 57:31.320
TNG as main story season. Yeah, it was still, it's still the worst story show of the season. But

57:31.320 --> 57:39.800
anyway, they brought back all the regulars of TNG. So Worf's gonna be in it. And that, that,

57:39.800 --> 57:45.160
that's already been announced. Yes. He's not in it yet. But we've seen Will and Beverly

57:45.160 --> 57:52.760
Crusher, but Geordi's coming back. Worf's coming back. Deanna? Deanna Troi's coming back. Data's

57:52.760 --> 57:58.040
dead, but apparently his actor is playing Lor. So Lor's coming back. Okay, one thing I want to

57:58.040 --> 58:05.240
say about the Star Trek universe is that I love the fact that like Data and Lor and all of what's,

58:05.240 --> 58:09.480
what's the scientist's name? The Soong family. Yeah, the Soong family is all just fucking played

58:09.800 --> 58:15.240
by Brent Spiner. That's my favorite trope of Star Trek and it's great. Like even in season two,

58:15.240 --> 58:23.320
Brent Spiner is like, like Asian ancestors, still Brent Spiner. Yeah. It's great. I love it. Yep.

58:23.320 --> 58:30.120
But it's so stupid. But Lor's coming back because you got to have Brent Spiner in the show.

58:30.120 --> 58:34.600
Apparently Tasha Yar's coming back. Okay, you told me she was dead. She is dead.

58:35.240 --> 58:39.480
How? Maybe Picard hallucinates or something on his deathbed again. It's like 15th deathbed.

58:39.800 --> 58:45.480
Who knows? Not Tasha Yar. Tasha Yar is dead. I meant the actress. The actress is dead,

58:45.480 --> 58:50.280
according to Dev. No, you told me. No, I didn't. Yes, you did. You told me the actress was dead.

58:50.280 --> 58:54.120
100%. I said the character was dead. No, you told me the actress was also dead.

58:54.120 --> 58:58.920
Because she was the one that turned to like drug use and such, right? No, no, no, no, no, no.

58:58.920 --> 59:03.960
That was Kesa's actress from Voyager. She's not dead though. She's like a drug-addled freak

59:03.960 --> 59:07.560
living in like Ohio or like fucking Wyoming or something. They're both white and blonde,

59:07.640 --> 59:13.160
mixed it up. Oh, white blonde and short hair? Yeah. No, man. Dude, Kesa's actress. Oh,

59:13.160 --> 59:16.760
fuck. Like you've seen those pictures, right? Okay, no. She's like, she's like running around

59:16.760 --> 59:21.240
like a fucking crack shack, exposing herself, like exposing her naked body of children

59:21.240 --> 59:25.960
on the street. She's like driving while like fucking heroin'd up. Like she, she's fucked.

59:25.960 --> 59:30.760
Yeah. She, she was like, yeah, you know, I, I had a few problems like back in 2012. She was like,

59:30.760 --> 59:33.000
I had a few problems. I got my life turned around. I'm gonna go back to school for like

59:33.000 --> 59:38.600
culinary arts. Nope. She just, she's, she's just, she's just fucking meth. That's all she is now.

59:38.600 --> 59:43.160
She's just meth. She's a person of meth. Okay. No, I thought Tasha Yara's actress was dead.

59:43.160 --> 59:47.480
Nope. Okay. Denise Crosby's still alive. That makes more sense then. Yeah.

59:47.480 --> 59:51.480
There's going to be either time travel, shenanigans or hallucinations then.

59:51.480 --> 59:55.000
Yeah. And I have a feeling it might be hallucinations this time because they already

59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.760
did the time travel. Yeah. So it's probably hallucinations. Or maybe they'll like bring

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.600
back the actress, actress, but have her play that half Romulan child that she had.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:09.400
Oh, maybe. That might be it. Is there anyone else they're getting from TNG to come back?

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:15.160
I think some side characters. Oh, we're on the Wikipedia right now. Jack Crusher is coming back.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:20.040
Who's Jack? Oh, that's the kid. That's the spoiler.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.160
Oh, I thought it was, well, wasn't, wasn't her husband named Jack Crusher?

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.280
Pretty sure he was not. Is this Jack Crusher Jr.?

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:30.200
Oh yeah. They're adding a couple of the Forge kids.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.240
Which is great.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:36.680
Yep. Oh, and they're bringing back Professor Moriarty. The holodeck guy.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.480
Oh my God.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.000
They got him back for some reason.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.600
It's going to be bad, but I'm excited, but it's going to be bad.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:50.280
It is going to be bad. Like he's supposed to be, I guess, a villain in this. Why? Okay.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.280
No, he might just be there to like help them out because he was just stuck in the holodeck,

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.760
remember? Like, but they saved his program because he was alive.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.560
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.440
Because, yeah.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.560
Instead of letting him be like the doctor on Voyager, they just, yeah.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:11.480
Well, they didn't have, they didn't have, what are they called? Portable, portable emitters.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.920
Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:15.160
Mobile emitter is what they called it.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:15.640
Yep.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.440
They didn't have that.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.720
There's not much to say about season three, episode one, because it's...

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.440
It's just the setup.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.080
It's just the setup.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:21.480
But like...

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:23.800
This is why we probably should have waited to do this video.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.560
No. Well, here's the... I didn't have anything else ready for today. So this is my filler.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:31.960
See, I want to point out that I said that Dev is lazy with his work at the beginning of this.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.520
Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.280
I am excited to see Geordi, though.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:40.760
Yeah.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.160
I'll say that.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.080
Apparently the visor's gone. He has eyes now.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.720
Yeah, but there was always an option for him, Dev.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.160
It was, but remember he said, I don't want them. I like the visor.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.760
He said that he made it a part of his identity that he didn't want to get real eyes.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.800
Then he got real eyes.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:59.080
Okay. I do want to point out that that one is slightly more okay. Only, only...

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:02.840
No. They're erasing blind representation. It's bigoted.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:09.480
Fine. Only because he mentioned that the visor gives him headaches every single day.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.040
Yeah.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:16.360
Yeah. If I'm an old person, I'm already in pain. I don't want the additional pain of headaches.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.840
If I can get rid of it. So...

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:20.520
Yeah, I guess.

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.440
And also it's like way in the future. It's probably just visor eyes.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:25.880
That's what they are, yeah.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.320
Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm saying.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.200
Why wouldn't you give everyone visor eyes, though?

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.560
Because not everyone's comfortable with taking their eyes out.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.000
Yeah, I guess, but they're better.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.480
This is not cyberpunk. This doesn't happen that often.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:43.880
Yeah. I think there's an idea that, in Trek at least, there's this idea that the reason

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:47.800
humans don't augment their body all the time, even though they could, is because they're...

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.600
It's partially illegal.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:53.560
No, no, it's not. Because they gave Nog a fake leg after the Dominion War.

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.520
Yeah, because he lost his actual leg.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:02.120
But here's the thing. They basically say, we don't feel this need anymore to constantly

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.040
improve ourselves. We're comfortable the way that we are. And they play it off as some sort

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.840
of maturity, where humanity has grown up. They're not vain anymore. They're not greedy anymore.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.680
So they don't feel the need to replace their body with robot parts all the time.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.200
They're comfortable in their own skin, and they only do it if they have to.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:25.240
So it's almost like a moral component of their society, that they're not doing the cyberpunk

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:25.960
thing.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.720
Yeah, I think... I have a feeling that their morality is probably based around plastic

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.000
surgery. You know?

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:38.760
Well, yeah, because we're, at the moment, in real life, society is not at the level

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:44.680
of being able to comfortably replace body parts with much more functional...

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:46.680
We'll get there eventually, I think.

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.640
No, no, we definitely will, because we're getting pretty close. But the thing is, there's

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:54.520
also phantom pain and stuff, and you'd have to get past that part first. There's extra

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:58.760
stuff. We're getting close. We're not there yet, though. So since we're not there yet,

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:04.760
the only closest thing that you could associate actual morality to when it comes to cyberpunk

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:11.080
like stuff, like the whole replacing your body with robot parts, is plastic surgery

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.880
for vaneness. Because generally, people who are not getting plastic surgery for a specific

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:20.280
medical reason, just to look better, are technically being vain. I am not against plastic

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.120
surgery, by the way. I'm not.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.760
You like giant Brazilian butts right in your face?

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.720
Sure, why not? I'm attracted to Kim Kardashian, I'll say it.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.000
Jesus Christ.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:29.480
Yeah.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:30.440
I'm done with you.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:35.160
Yeah, but like, I'm not against plastic surgery for people who want to do that. But I think

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:40.200
that if we're just like, especially in the 50s or 60s or whatever, like for the old show,

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:46.280
no one's augmenting anything. You could only really relate that back to probably plastic surgery.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:46.840
Maybe, yeah.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:52.280
Yeah. Of course, I don't know how good plastic surgery was in the 50s to make this comparison.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.680
So maybe I'm just totally fucking wrong. I don't fucking know. But I'm just saying,

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:02.360
it probably stems from that. And then, you know, cyberpunk is slightly more newish thing.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:03.800
Well, in terms of-

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.400
More mainstream newish thing.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.680
In terms of Picard, though.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.160
Yeah.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.280
It's not a good show.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:08.440
No.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.480
I wouldn't recommend anyone watch it.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.440
Nobody should watch it.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:18.520
There's nothing really like good about it, frankly. I didn't enjoy watching it. I didn't,

01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:24.920
I don't think that like, there's lower callbacks, but it's cheap. It feels cheap. Everything does

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:33.960
not, nothing in the show is good. The only plus that I can give this show is that it's not Picard

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:39.160
seasons one and two. That's it. It's still a bad show. Everything's still negative. I still

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.520
wouldn't watch it if I was on my own.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:45.400
No. I would not have missed anything in my life if I'd never watched this.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:50.440
I have heard some people say that they did the reset button on season three so cleanly

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.200
that if you just went from like Nemesis and Insurrection to Picard season three,

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:56.920
You wouldn't have missed anything.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:02.920
You wouldn't miss anything because nothing that happens in seasons one and two really matter that

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:10.440
Which is a really bad episode. Like that's a such a bad show. Take like, Oh yeah,

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.760
you're going to skip the first two seasons of the show and it won't have been anything. It's fine.

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.360
I'm just like, wow, that's just sad.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:19.800
Cause none of the lore stuck. None of the characters stuck around except for Raffi.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:27.720
Her character can just be explained away by, Oh, she's an intelligence. Obviously has it like,

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.080
obviously was a drug addict.

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.840
Yeah. Cause she drops the drugs in the scene.

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.760
There's there's, you know what I'll say for that moment of,

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:38.520
since I'm watching house currently, I'm binge watching, watching Dr. House.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:44.440
They did the, her like looking at the drugs and like dropping them. And like, I think she was,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.240
was she still holding drugs in the ship? No.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.120
No. Okay. So she dropped the drugs that she definitely kind of wanted to take.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.320
And they did that moment very well. I enjoy that. I was like, is she going to do it?

01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:58.280
Cause I wasn't sure. Cause like with lots of Picard,

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.080
as soon as a character encounters a crossroads like that,

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.800
I can almost instantly be like, they're going to do that. And then they do.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.760
And I'm always right. Which is like, I'm not smart. So this is like,

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:12.920
that's a really bad sign of a show that I can just immediately tell what a character is going to do

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.240
when they come to a crossroads and they don't surprise me.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.560
You know, but they did that moment very well. Like she definitely, she dropped it,

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:24.600
but it was a very uncertain moment. So I th I think they might do that storyline a bit

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:29.080
better than what they currently were doing. Cause in season two, it wasn't an issue at all.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.600
I think she was over it. Yeah. Yeah. But now she's not.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:38.600
Whatever. Yeah. So that's bad. But if you forget about season two, that is fine.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.760
You can forget about season one. You can forget about the entire show.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.960
Yeah. Well, no, actually, cause. If you forget that all of Picard

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.880
existed, your life will probably be better. Your life will be better. Yeah, definitely.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:57.480
Yeah. So I guess that's, that's what happened in season, in season three, episode one. It's,

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:05.240
it's still not good. I'm still not enjoying watching the show, but it's not, it's not.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:11.400
I'm now enjoying it. Yeah, no, I, I legitimately have been so scarred by season one and two of

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:19.080
Picard that like my bad, like levels of is media bad or actually ruined. Anything that is not as

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:23.160
bad as season two, Picard and was like, it's good. I can watch this. It's great. Like, like,

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:29.240
like with Velma. Yeah. I can watch this. It's fine. I have been ruined and it's your fault.

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:32.920
Oh, it's my fault. Yes. You made me watch it. I would not have watched it otherwise.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.280
I'd have watched a couple, a few episodes of Picard season one and been like, fuck this show.

01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:41.560
I hate everything. I don't want to watch star Trek stuff for a while now.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.680
No, because of you, I've been ruined and you've been kind of ruined too.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:53.000
And it's all your fault. It's all your fault for making me watch it.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.040
That's okay. We're going to get a good video out of it one day.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:00.600
No, you'll get a good video. I will just be ruined with nothing to show for it.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.480
I'll put you into the video.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.800
Don't watch Picard. Don't do it. It's bad.
