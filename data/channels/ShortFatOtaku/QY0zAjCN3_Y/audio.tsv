0	3840	Hello, everyone. How's it going? This is a bit of a different video today.
4680	8200	We're going to be talking about the Project Veritas Exposing Google
8200	13440	Political Bias video that came out on June 25th.
13440	16320	Now, those of you who don't know,
16320	19880	this video has basically been banned from the entire Internet.
20120	22560	They won't let you talk about it on Facebook or Twitter.
22960	25600	It's certainly not up on YouTube. You can't talk about it on Reddit.
25920	28160	The only place you can find it, in fact, is on Bitchute.
28160	29400	And that's where I'm watching it now.
29400	34760	Also, you can't even upload parts of it or clips of it to YouTube to talk about.
34880	38440	You can talk about it on YouTube because Tim Pool and V and others
38440	42280	have talked about it on YouTube, but you can't upload clips of it or images.
42280	43880	I don't even think you can upload audio of it.
43880	45240	So here's what we're going to do.
45240	46240	We're going to watch this video.
46240	47840	You may follow along.
47840	51040	And when I pause to commentate, you will see a timestamp.
51120	53120	Make sure to be watching it on Bitchute.
53120	55560	It's pretty easy to find there. So.
57160	58360	Let's begin.
58400	62000	OK, I skipped ahead to one minute and fifty six seconds,
62440	65200	just because the first two minutes of the thing is basically
65200	67840	like a trailer or a teaser for what's inside of it. So let's go.
70080	73080	I personally don't think it's Google's place
73560	76080	to be preventing what happened in 2016.
76640	79600	People voted. People voted for Trump. Trump won.
79960	82240	People didn't want Hillary.
82240	85120	It's not Google's place to put a president into power.
86120	89080	So, yeah, it sounds like Google was all for free speech
89080	91240	until it swung against their way.
91720	95720	They definitely enjoyed the benefits of it when progressivism was on the rise.
95720	100800	But now that centrism and even rightism is on the rise, they want to stifle it.
100800	102720	They want to control everyone online.
102720	106320	This is almost like an emperor has no clothes situation.
106320	108920	Everyone was willing to play the game with Google and with Facebook
108920	112120	and with Twitter. But as soon as Trump won, all bets were off.
116040	117840	The way this woman talks,
117840	122000	it sounds like she really does live in that Southern California bubble,
122280	125960	doesn't it? Like she's she's talking about fairness
126200	129280	as if it's something that everyone agrees on, like it's a settled issue.
129600	132600	Like, oh, who would disagree with my idea of fairness
133000	136080	helping marginalized communities like obviously that's fair, right?
136280	139040	My subjective definition, that's obviously what's correct.
139320	141040	And everyone should listen to it, right?
141040	144160	It's almost like she hasn't ever left her bubble.
144520	146200	So she has no idea.
146200	150440	She hasn't even conceived of people objecting to her or why they might.
150440	153960	What good reasons they might have for objecting to her definition of fairness.
154240	157800	And moreover, again, it's not really Google's job to do any of this.
158000	163440	Use A.I. to tweak algorithms for fairness, for your idea of fairness
163440	164880	regarding marginalized communities.
164880	166520	It's it's insane. It's insanity.
169720	172200	So so basically exactly what we've all been saying this whole time.
172240	175040	They have no problem with suppressing speech and putting forward
175040	178560	their subjective ideas if it prevents Trump, if it prevents Brexit,
178920	180240	if it prevents Gamergate, probably.
180240	183560	I'm sure there are some people in Google who are still crying over Gamergate.
183960	185880	This is not the place of a private company.
188480	189400	Hold on, we got to try this.
189400	191560	We got to hold on a second. Let's go.
191560	193240	Here we go. Google,
194040	196400	google.com. Women can.
198120	200960	Women Canada soccer, women cancer, women can fly, women can do it.
201000	203880	Women canvas shoes, vote, do anything, be drafted.
203920	205680	OK, men can have babies.
205680	207320	Men can get pregnant and babies now.
207320	212120	Yeah. Jesus, it actually actually works port inappropriate predictions.
212520	213920	How about fucking all of them?
216080	217200	So hold on, hold on.
217200	222280	Algorithmic unfairness specifically refers to things that are true,
222800	224840	but they don't like politically.
224840	228200	So the whole 12 percent, 51 percent statistic.
229200	231680	You know, that's algorithmic unfairness, it's the truth,
232160	234920	but that's not the world as they want to see it, so they're going to censor it.
235120	238840	Is that what we're talking about here or the whole male CEOs thing?
239400	241440	Why there are a lot of Jewish people in the one percent?
241760	245800	I wonder if they're applying algorithmic unfairness to things that that do not
245800	250480	benefit these minorities or these protected classes like like male suicide
250480	254160	or something, are they going to show more pictures of female suicides
254160	255600	just just to equal it out?
255600	256480	I mean, probably not.
258200	263400	Product intervention.
264960	268200	See, I remember
268200	271880	some people were talking about how like selling your data isn't a big deal.
272560	275200	You know, what does it matter if Facebook and Amazon and Google,
275240	278920	you know, install cookies onto your computer and track what you're doing
278920	281760	and track your purchases and sell that data to other companies?
282080	283000	What does it matter?
283000	285560	Well, sorry, I'm still a little bit sick.
285560	288120	Well, it matters because you have to be able to
289520	291400	freely think.
291400	293280	And if you have an idea
293280	295600	and you know, it's maybe it's like a half articulated idea
295600	296840	and you want to go look it up
296840	298840	or you want to see if somebody else has an idea
298840	300320	or you want to post it on a form
300320	303440	or you want to maybe search up some terms related to the idea
303440	307000	and see if you can figure a few things out and get to the bottom of something.
308120	312400	If Google actively fights against you, because that's an idea
312400	316360	that they have not approved or that they explicitly disapprove of.
316440	318960	That's social engineering. That's actively.
319160	321880	I mean, I don't know if it really qualifies as
322680	325040	infringing on your rights because they're a private company
325040	326680	and they do have rights themselves.
326680	328800	But it's certainly social engineering.
329120	331920	And I don't think I have to say this, but but that is a bad thing.
331920	334200	That's frankly, it's an evil thing.
334200	337600	If Google understands that there's a set of ideas
337760	341440	that if they remain unarticulated, they they become weak
341960	344840	in people's minds and they can easily kind of steamroll them
344840	348480	with with collectivized thought or with propaganda or whatever.
348920	352080	And if they can prevent people from properly articulating those ideas
352080	356480	through censorship and they and they have the willingness to do that.
356640	359320	That's evil. That is pure evil.
360280	362800	And it's and frankly, it's it's anti-democratic.
367160	370920	We can't be evil because we have defined ourselves as good.
372160	375320	Holy fuck. OK.
376160	379560	This is why every single independent news or political channel on YouTube
379560	385600	is is getting throttled in place of of CNN and MSNBC and ABC and others.
385720	387720	I mean, I did that video yesterday where I kind of showed that
387720	391160	there was Bloomberg with 111 hits in 52 minutes,
391160	394160	and I blew past that in about 10 minutes on that video.
394960	397600	So it's very clear what they're choosing for trending.
398000	399200	It's not actually trends.
401920	404280	I think we can kind of see this to be true.
404280	408120	For example, compare Christ Church, the Christ Church massacre
408640	412120	and how social media responded and the news media responded.
412400	417080	Compare that with the attack on the ice facility just a couple of days ago.
417320	420440	Christ Church was all over the news, all over the mainstream media.
420760	422920	It was on Google and YouTube,
423720	428200	but only sources that were, say, roundly condemning them
428200	430360	and also blaming the entire conservative sphere.
430360	433240	And frankly, the centrist and center left sphere as well
433240	435720	for Christ Church blaming everything under the sun.
435720	439280	You got video games, you got 4chan, you got memes, you got the Internet,
439640	443800	you got everything but the SJW is blaming it all on everything.
443920	445320	The whole Christ Church thing.
445320	446440	And that's what was pushed.
446440	447960	That's what was pushed to the front page.
447960	450600	Those videos from those networks are pushed to the front page.
450640	453200	That was the allowed opinion on Twitter and Facebook.
453480	455520	But compare that to the ice facility attack.
456360	458920	People are praising that guy for his terrorism.
459640	460760	Doesn't seem to matter.
460760	462080	No one's getting banned for it.
462080	463160	Videos aren't getting taken.
463160	465440	Videos of people praising him, they're not getting taken down.
466480	468520	The media is largely silent.
468520	469840	Nothing is getting pushed.
469840	471960	And when the mainstream media does talk about it,
472280	475880	they don't mention Antifa, even though he was a member of Antifa
475880	478920	and he talks about Antifa in his manifesto.
478960	482600	And all of that is, again, what Google pushes on YouTube and other places.
482880	484480	It's obvious who these guys play for.
485480	488320	Holy shit, they actually have people are programmed.
489760	492760	Really, is that remember Google?
492760	496240	Google's Google's catchphrase was, don't be evil.
497400	499960	Programming people is pretty much the definition of evil.
503200	504640	That's incredible.
504640	509640	The the complete disdain they have for the legitimate government
509640	512080	of their own country is wild.
512080	514200	The representatives of the people, they don't care.
514400	515240	They want to fuck the people.
515240	516320	They don't want to be accountable to them.
519160	521120	Oh, my God, I can't believe I have to say this.
521320	524760	It's not Google's place to prevent Trump 2020.
525120	528360	If you OK, if you want Trump to not get elected again,
528920	531720	put forward somebody who can actually beat him.
532360	534520	That's it. That's how you win.
534760	537560	It's not through all this social engineering bullshit here.
537560	539680	Here you want to beat Trump?
539680	541400	Put forward Tulsi Gabbard.
541400	543680	There you go. Stop being cucks.
543680	545320	Democrats, stop being cucks.
545320	547960	Put forward Tulsi Gabbard.
547960	549680	She's the only one who's going to beat Trump.
549680	551120	Everyone else is a loser.
553120	555120	Hold on a minute. That can't be true.
557760	560200	Hillary Clinton's emails.
560200	561760	Yeah, nothing.
561760	565640	How about just like Clinton emails?
565880	568040	Clinton emails.
569000	571040	Well, there's a few things.
571040	572680	Data set.
574880	578720	OK, well, maybe, hmm, I don't know what Trump's
580280	583760	emails. No, nothing for Trump's emails either.
585880	587600	I don't know about this one.
591400	594280	Yeah, see, it's it's one thing to put forward
594520	596240	a preferred point of view.
596240	599120	It's another thing entirely to delete points of view,
599120	601680	because like the first one's bad enough.
601840	603720	The second one is abominable.
603720	604840	I think about it this way.
604840	606440	OK, you have preferred speech.
606440	607680	You know, you can say whatever you want,
607680	610960	but the government or whoever prefers that you would say this.
611240	613280	But you can say whatever you want. OK.
613280	616440	At least then you have the choice to take in their in their view,
616440	617520	the less optimum route.
617520	619640	You still have the choice as a free person.
619640	623520	However, when you only have the choice to do what they want,
623520	625160	that's compelled speech.
625160	626240	That's a very different situation.
626240	627840	I know that this isn't strictly that.
627840	632080	You know, this is not like you can't search for Hillary Clinton's emails.
632080	633040	You very obviously can.
633040	634640	It's just not going to auto complete.
634640	636880	So it's not straight up compelled speech,
637200	640000	but they are kind of shepherding you in that direction.
640280	643600	It's like it's like the first baby steps leading to compelled speech,
643880	646840	which is absolutely terrifying.
647680	648960	I did a video on this.
648960	652080	This is unfortunately not true, but it's a very popular misconception.
652400	656720	Even even Senator Ted Cruz in his grilling of somebody at Google
656880	660200	after this video came out, even he repeated this.
660240	663280	It is not the case that Section 230 requires them to be impartial.
663280	665240	And there's actually an amendment
665240	668400	coming forward from a Republican that wants to make it so.
668680	670200	And hopefully they do.
671040	672800	I have to admit, I haven't seen this,
672800	674840	but I think I'm too small to be affected by it.
674840	677960	You know, my videos might get 10, 20, sometimes 30,000,
678280	679280	maybe six figures.
679280	682160	If it's if it's a really good one or one that goes viral.
682160	686440	I've had that happen a handful of times, but it stayed around that that point.
687320	689480	Maybe they still think that I'm an anime channel.
689480	692520	You know, the name Shortfire Otaku kind of kind of lends itself to it.
692520	695560	Maybe I'm flying into the radar. Who knows?
695560	698280	Oh, my God, Dave, Dave Rubin has right wing.
698280	701440	I mean, if anything, he's like slightly right of center.
701720	703840	Tim Pool is definitely not right wing.
703840	705760	He's center left. He's like me.
705760	707440	I'm a center lefty, too.
707440	709800	I think for them, the Overton window has shifted so far
709800	712000	that right wing is just whatever is not them.
713880	716720	OK, that that that that that's a meme.
716720	717640	OK, that's a meme.
717640	720720	Um, I do have to say this about 1984 at this point.
721240	723720	Read another book just like Harry Potter.
723720	724360	Read another book.
727840	729720	So there we are. That was it.
730600	734680	Um, I don't know if there's much else to say, my friends, like.
735680	739240	This is all stuff we knew was was happening,
739720	743120	but it's something else to hear it straight from the horse's mouth.
743400	746360	It's kind of like with CNN member Veritas did, I think,
746640	748840	back during the 2016 election.
748840	752120	They got somebody from CNN to laugh at the idea of ethics
752880	756480	and talk about how their business and they're they're there to push Hillary.
757320	759640	That was a Veritas leak as well.
759640	761400	And we all knew that was the case.
761400	764440	But again, it was important to hear it from the horse's mouth.
765240	766440	And that's what this is.
766440	768040	I think it's going to get worse.
768040	769960	I think Google is going to crack down through YouTube
769960	772080	is going to crack down on all of us.
772080	774520	They will probably eventually come for me.
774520	778160	I know I haven't shown a single thing from the actual video.
778160	781280	I've only talked about it, but they'll probably still find a way.
781400	783400	This will be up on Bitchute, though, as always.
783400	786320	And frankly, at this point, we just have to hope that
786760	789480	that Trump can do something before he's he's voted out.
789480	793920	Like if Google has their way, it won't be Trump in 2020.
794000	795880	So something has to be done about this.
795880	798480	This is this is quite literally destroying the Internet
798480	801440	and not just the Internet, but also American politics.
801480	802520	And on a more personal note,
802520	805920	it's destroying the reason why I wanted to be a YouTuber in the first place,
805920	808240	because I actually believed in the platform
808240	811680	and in the idea of directly communicating with an audience.
812680	816200	Google is literally fucking everything and everyone
816200	817640	for their own personal benefit.
817640	819080	And it's got to stop.
819080	820720	I don't know if there's anything more to say than that.
820720	821880	It's got to stop.
821880	822960	I thank you very much for watching.
823000	824800	Thank you very much for supporting me.
824800	826560	If you feel like supporting me financially,
826560	829840	there's SubscribeStar at SubscribeStar.com
829840	835120	For a one time tip, there's always PayPal.me
835320	838560	and as I like to commonly point out,
838760	840800	I have a gaming channel called Game Boomers.
841080	844120	I stream on it every night, twitch.tv slash Game Boomers,
844640	849800	and I upload the the stream archives to YouTube.com slash Game Boomer.
850600	853200	Any one of those things where there's donations
853200	856600	or supporting side projects or supporting even just SFO generally,
856880	858000	they all help me out.
858000	861680	So I've got another video coming out a little bit later in the week,
861680	863880	and I'm probably going to go start working on that right now.
863880	866400	In any case, I'll catch you later. I love you.
