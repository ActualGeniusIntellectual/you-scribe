WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
Hello, everyone. How's it going? This is a bit of a different video today.

00:04.680 --> 00:08.200
We're going to be talking about the Project Veritas Exposing Google

00:08.200 --> 00:13.440
Political Bias video that came out on June 25th.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.320
Now, those of you who don't know,

00:16.320 --> 00:19.880
this video has basically been banned from the entire Internet.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.560
They won't let you talk about it on Facebook or Twitter.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.600
It's certainly not up on YouTube. You can't talk about it on Reddit.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.160
The only place you can find it, in fact, is on Bitchute.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.400
And that's where I'm watching it now.

00:29.400 --> 00:34.760
Also, you can't even upload parts of it or clips of it to YouTube to talk about.

00:34.880 --> 00:38.440
You can talk about it on YouTube because Tim Pool and V and others

00:38.440 --> 00:42.280
have talked about it on YouTube, but you can't upload clips of it or images.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.880
I don't even think you can upload audio of it.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.240
So here's what we're going to do.

00:45.240 --> 00:46.240
We're going to watch this video.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.840
You may follow along.

00:47.840 --> 00:51.040
And when I pause to commentate, you will see a timestamp.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.120
Make sure to be watching it on Bitchute.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.560
It's pretty easy to find there. So.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.360
Let's begin.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.000
OK, I skipped ahead to one minute and fifty six seconds,

01:02.440 --> 01:05.200
just because the first two minutes of the thing is basically

01:05.200 --> 01:07.840
like a trailer or a teaser for what's inside of it. So let's go.

01:10.080 --> 01:13.080
I personally don't think it's Google's place

01:13.560 --> 01:16.080
to be preventing what happened in 2016.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.600
People voted. People voted for Trump. Trump won.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.240
People didn't want Hillary.

01:22.240 --> 01:25.120
It's not Google's place to put a president into power.

01:26.120 --> 01:29.080
So, yeah, it sounds like Google was all for free speech

01:29.080 --> 01:31.240
until it swung against their way.

01:31.720 --> 01:35.720
They definitely enjoyed the benefits of it when progressivism was on the rise.

01:35.720 --> 01:40.800
But now that centrism and even rightism is on the rise, they want to stifle it.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.720
They want to control everyone online.

01:42.720 --> 01:46.320
This is almost like an emperor has no clothes situation.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.920
Everyone was willing to play the game with Google and with Facebook

01:48.920 --> 01:52.120
and with Twitter. But as soon as Trump won, all bets were off.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.840
The way this woman talks,

01:57.840 --> 02:02.000
it sounds like she really does live in that Southern California bubble,

02:02.280 --> 02:05.960
doesn't it? Like she's she's talking about fairness

02:06.200 --> 02:09.280
as if it's something that everyone agrees on, like it's a settled issue.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.600
Like, oh, who would disagree with my idea of fairness

02:13.000 --> 02:16.080
helping marginalized communities like obviously that's fair, right?

02:16.280 --> 02:19.040
My subjective definition, that's obviously what's correct.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.040
And everyone should listen to it, right?

02:21.040 --> 02:24.160
It's almost like she hasn't ever left her bubble.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.200
So she has no idea.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.440
She hasn't even conceived of people objecting to her or why they might.

02:30.440 --> 02:33.960
What good reasons they might have for objecting to her definition of fairness.

02:34.240 --> 02:37.800
And moreover, again, it's not really Google's job to do any of this.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.440
Use A.I. to tweak algorithms for fairness, for your idea of fairness

02:43.440 --> 02:44.880
regarding marginalized communities.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.520
It's it's insane. It's insanity.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.200
So so basically exactly what we've all been saying this whole time.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.040
They have no problem with suppressing speech and putting forward

02:55.040 --> 02:58.560
their subjective ideas if it prevents Trump, if it prevents Brexit,

02:58.920 --> 03:00.240
if it prevents Gamergate, probably.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.560
I'm sure there are some people in Google who are still crying over Gamergate.

03:03.960 --> 03:05.880
This is not the place of a private company.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.400
Hold on, we got to try this.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.560
We got to hold on a second. Let's go.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.240
Here we go. Google,

03:14.040 --> 03:16.400
google.com. Women can.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.960
Women Canada soccer, women cancer, women can fly, women can do it.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.880
Women canvas shoes, vote, do anything, be drafted.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.680
OK, men can have babies.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.320
Men can get pregnant and babies now.

03:27.320 --> 03:32.120
Yeah. Jesus, it actually actually works port inappropriate predictions.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.920
How about fucking all of them?

03:36.080 --> 03:37.200
So hold on, hold on.

03:37.200 --> 03:42.280
Algorithmic unfairness specifically refers to things that are true,

03:42.800 --> 03:44.840
but they don't like politically.

03:44.840 --> 03:48.200
So the whole 12 percent, 51 percent statistic.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.680
You know, that's algorithmic unfairness, it's the truth,

03:52.160 --> 03:54.920
but that's not the world as they want to see it, so they're going to censor it.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.840
Is that what we're talking about here or the whole male CEOs thing?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.440
Why there are a lot of Jewish people in the one percent?

04:01.760 --> 04:05.800
I wonder if they're applying algorithmic unfairness to things that that do not

04:05.800 --> 04:10.480
benefit these minorities or these protected classes like like male suicide

04:10.480 --> 04:14.160
or something, are they going to show more pictures of female suicides

04:14.160 --> 04:15.600
just just to equal it out?

04:15.600 --> 04:16.480
I mean, probably not.

04:18.200 --> 04:23.400
Product intervention.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.200
See, I remember

04:28.200 --> 04:31.880
some people were talking about how like selling your data isn't a big deal.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.200
You know, what does it matter if Facebook and Amazon and Google,

04:35.240 --> 04:38.920
you know, install cookies onto your computer and track what you're doing

04:38.920 --> 04:41.760
and track your purchases and sell that data to other companies?

04:42.080 --> 04:43.000
What does it matter?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.560
Well, sorry, I'm still a little bit sick.

04:45.560 --> 04:48.120
Well, it matters because you have to be able to

04:49.520 --> 04:51.400
freely think.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.280
And if you have an idea

04:53.280 --> 04:55.600
and you know, it's maybe it's like a half articulated idea

04:55.600 --> 04:56.840
and you want to go look it up

04:56.840 --> 04:58.840
or you want to see if somebody else has an idea

04:58.840 --> 05:00.320
or you want to post it on a form

05:00.320 --> 05:03.440
or you want to maybe search up some terms related to the idea

05:03.440 --> 05:07.000
and see if you can figure a few things out and get to the bottom of something.

05:08.120 --> 05:12.400
If Google actively fights against you, because that's an idea

05:12.400 --> 05:16.360
that they have not approved or that they explicitly disapprove of.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.960
That's social engineering. That's actively.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.880
I mean, I don't know if it really qualifies as

05:22.680 --> 05:25.040
infringing on your rights because they're a private company

05:25.040 --> 05:26.680
and they do have rights themselves.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.800
But it's certainly social engineering.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.920
And I don't think I have to say this, but but that is a bad thing.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.200
That's frankly, it's an evil thing.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.600
If Google understands that there's a set of ideas

05:37.760 --> 05:41.440
that if they remain unarticulated, they they become weak

05:41.960 --> 05:44.840
in people's minds and they can easily kind of steamroll them

05:44.840 --> 05:48.480
with with collectivized thought or with propaganda or whatever.

05:48.920 --> 05:52.080
And if they can prevent people from properly articulating those ideas

05:52.080 --> 05:56.480
through censorship and they and they have the willingness to do that.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.320
That's evil. That is pure evil.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.800
And it's and frankly, it's it's anti-democratic.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.920
We can't be evil because we have defined ourselves as good.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.320
Holy fuck. OK.

06:16.160 --> 06:19.560
This is why every single independent news or political channel on YouTube

06:19.560 --> 06:25.600
is is getting throttled in place of of CNN and MSNBC and ABC and others.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.720
I mean, I did that video yesterday where I kind of showed that

06:27.720 --> 06:31.160
there was Bloomberg with 111 hits in 52 minutes,

06:31.160 --> 06:34.160
and I blew past that in about 10 minutes on that video.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.600
So it's very clear what they're choosing for trending.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.200
It's not actually trends.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.280
I think we can kind of see this to be true.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.120
For example, compare Christ Church, the Christ Church massacre

06:48.640 --> 06:52.120
and how social media responded and the news media responded.

06:52.400 --> 06:57.080
Compare that with the attack on the ice facility just a couple of days ago.

06:57.320 --> 07:00.440
Christ Church was all over the news, all over the mainstream media.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.920
It was on Google and YouTube,

07:03.720 --> 07:08.200
but only sources that were, say, roundly condemning them

07:08.200 --> 07:10.360
and also blaming the entire conservative sphere.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.240
And frankly, the centrist and center left sphere as well

07:13.240 --> 07:15.720
for Christ Church blaming everything under the sun.

07:15.720 --> 07:19.280
You got video games, you got 4chan, you got memes, you got the Internet,

07:19.640 --> 07:23.800
you got everything but the SJW is blaming it all on everything.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.320
The whole Christ Church thing.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.440
And that's what was pushed.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.960
That's what was pushed to the front page.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.600
Those videos from those networks are pushed to the front page.

07:30.640 --> 07:33.200
That was the allowed opinion on Twitter and Facebook.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.520
But compare that to the ice facility attack.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.920
People are praising that guy for his terrorism.

07:39.640 --> 07:40.760
Doesn't seem to matter.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.080
No one's getting banned for it.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.160
Videos aren't getting taken.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.440
Videos of people praising him, they're not getting taken down.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.520
The media is largely silent.

07:48.520 --> 07:49.840
Nothing is getting pushed.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.960
And when the mainstream media does talk about it,

07:52.280 --> 07:55.880
they don't mention Antifa, even though he was a member of Antifa

07:55.880 --> 07:58.920
and he talks about Antifa in his manifesto.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.600
And all of that is, again, what Google pushes on YouTube and other places.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.480
It's obvious who these guys play for.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.320
Holy shit, they actually have people are programmed.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.760
Really, is that remember Google?

08:12.760 --> 08:16.240
Google's Google's catchphrase was, don't be evil.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.960
Programming people is pretty much the definition of evil.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.640
That's incredible.

08:24.640 --> 08:29.640
The the complete disdain they have for the legitimate government

08:29.640 --> 08:32.080
of their own country is wild.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.200
The representatives of the people, they don't care.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.240
They want to fuck the people.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.320
They don't want to be accountable to them.

08:39.160 --> 08:41.120
Oh, my God, I can't believe I have to say this.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.760
It's not Google's place to prevent Trump 2020.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.360
If you OK, if you want Trump to not get elected again,

08:48.920 --> 08:51.720
put forward somebody who can actually beat him.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.520
That's it. That's how you win.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.560
It's not through all this social engineering bullshit here.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.680
Here you want to beat Trump?

08:59.680 --> 09:01.400
Put forward Tulsi Gabbard.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.680
There you go. Stop being cucks.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.320
Democrats, stop being cucks.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.960
Put forward Tulsi Gabbard.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.680
She's the only one who's going to beat Trump.

09:09.680 --> 09:11.120
Everyone else is a loser.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.120
Hold on a minute. That can't be true.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.200
Hillary Clinton's emails.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.760
Yeah, nothing.

09:21.760 --> 09:25.640
How about just like Clinton emails?

09:25.880 --> 09:28.040
Clinton emails.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.040
Well, there's a few things.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.680
Data set.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.720
OK, well, maybe, hmm, I don't know what Trump's

09:40.280 --> 09:43.760
emails. No, nothing for Trump's emails either.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.600
I don't know about this one.

09:51.400 --> 09:54.280
Yeah, see, it's it's one thing to put forward

09:54.520 --> 09:56.240
a preferred point of view.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.120
It's another thing entirely to delete points of view,

09:59.120 --> 10:01.680
because like the first one's bad enough.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.720
The second one is abominable.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.840
I think about it this way.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.440
OK, you have preferred speech.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.680
You know, you can say whatever you want,

10:07.680 --> 10:10.960
but the government or whoever prefers that you would say this.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.280
But you can say whatever you want. OK.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.440
At least then you have the choice to take in their in their view,

10:16.440 --> 10:17.520
the less optimum route.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.640
You still have the choice as a free person.

10:19.640 --> 10:23.520
However, when you only have the choice to do what they want,

10:23.520 --> 10:25.160
that's compelled speech.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.240
That's a very different situation.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.840
I know that this isn't strictly that.

10:27.840 --> 10:32.080
You know, this is not like you can't search for Hillary Clinton's emails.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.040
You very obviously can.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.640
It's just not going to auto complete.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.880
So it's not straight up compelled speech,

10:37.200 --> 10:40.000
but they are kind of shepherding you in that direction.

10:40.280 --> 10:43.600
It's like it's like the first baby steps leading to compelled speech,

10:43.880 --> 10:46.840
which is absolutely terrifying.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.960
I did a video on this.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.080
This is unfortunately not true, but it's a very popular misconception.

10:52.400 --> 10:56.720
Even even Senator Ted Cruz in his grilling of somebody at Google

10:56.880 --> 11:00.200
after this video came out, even he repeated this.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.280
It is not the case that Section 230 requires them to be impartial.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.240
And there's actually an amendment

11:05.240 --> 11:08.400
coming forward from a Republican that wants to make it so.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.200
And hopefully they do.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.800
I have to admit, I haven't seen this,

11:12.800 --> 11:14.840
but I think I'm too small to be affected by it.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.960
You know, my videos might get 10, 20, sometimes 30,000,

11:18.280 --> 11:19.280
maybe six figures.

11:19.280 --> 11:22.160
If it's if it's a really good one or one that goes viral.

11:22.160 --> 11:26.440
I've had that happen a handful of times, but it stayed around that that point.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.480
Maybe they still think that I'm an anime channel.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.520
You know, the name Shortfire Otaku kind of kind of lends itself to it.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.560
Maybe I'm flying into the radar. Who knows?

11:35.560 --> 11:38.280
Oh, my God, Dave, Dave Rubin has right wing.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.440
I mean, if anything, he's like slightly right of center.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.840
Tim Pool is definitely not right wing.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.760
He's center left. He's like me.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.440
I'm a center lefty, too.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.800
I think for them, the Overton window has shifted so far

11:49.800 --> 11:52.000
that right wing is just whatever is not them.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.720
OK, that that that that that's a meme.

11:56.720 --> 11:57.640
OK, that's a meme.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.720
Um, I do have to say this about 1984 at this point.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.720
Read another book just like Harry Potter.

12:03.720 --> 12:04.360
Read another book.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.720
So there we are. That was it.

12:10.600 --> 12:14.680
Um, I don't know if there's much else to say, my friends, like.

12:15.680 --> 12:19.240
This is all stuff we knew was was happening,

12:19.720 --> 12:23.120
but it's something else to hear it straight from the horse's mouth.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.360
It's kind of like with CNN member Veritas did, I think,

12:26.640 --> 12:28.840
back during the 2016 election.

12:28.840 --> 12:32.120
They got somebody from CNN to laugh at the idea of ethics

12:32.880 --> 12:36.480
and talk about how their business and they're they're there to push Hillary.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.640
That was a Veritas leak as well.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.400
And we all knew that was the case.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.440
But again, it was important to hear it from the horse's mouth.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.440
And that's what this is.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.040
I think it's going to get worse.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.960
I think Google is going to crack down through YouTube

12:49.960 --> 12:52.080
is going to crack down on all of us.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.520
They will probably eventually come for me.

12:54.520 --> 12:58.160
I know I haven't shown a single thing from the actual video.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.280
I've only talked about it, but they'll probably still find a way.

13:01.400 --> 13:03.400
This will be up on Bitchute, though, as always.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.320
And frankly, at this point, we just have to hope that

13:06.760 --> 13:09.480
that Trump can do something before he's he's voted out.

13:09.480 --> 13:13.920
Like if Google has their way, it won't be Trump in 2020.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.880
So something has to be done about this.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.480
This is this is quite literally destroying the Internet

13:18.480 --> 13:21.440
and not just the Internet, but also American politics.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.520
And on a more personal note,

13:22.520 --> 13:25.920
it's destroying the reason why I wanted to be a YouTuber in the first place,

13:25.920 --> 13:28.240
because I actually believed in the platform

13:28.240 --> 13:31.680
and in the idea of directly communicating with an audience.

13:32.680 --> 13:36.200
Google is literally fucking everything and everyone

13:36.200 --> 13:37.640
for their own personal benefit.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.080
And it's got to stop.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.720
I don't know if there's anything more to say than that.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.880
It's got to stop.

13:41.880 --> 13:42.960
I thank you very much for watching.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.800
Thank you very much for supporting me.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.560
If you feel like supporting me financially,

13:46.560 --> 13:49.840
there's SubscribeStar at SubscribeStar.com

13:49.840 --> 13:55.120
For a one time tip, there's always PayPal.me

13:55.320 --> 13:58.560
and as I like to commonly point out,

13:58.760 --> 14:00.800
I have a gaming channel called Game Boomers.

14:01.080 --> 14:04.120
I stream on it every night, twitch.tv slash Game Boomers,

14:04.640 --> 14:09.800
and I upload the the stream archives to YouTube.com slash Game Boomer.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.200
Any one of those things where there's donations

14:13.200 --> 14:16.600
or supporting side projects or supporting even just SFO generally,

14:16.880 --> 14:18.000
they all help me out.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.680
So I've got another video coming out a little bit later in the week,

14:21.680 --> 14:23.880
and I'm probably going to go start working on that right now.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.400
In any case, I'll catch you later. I love you.
