00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello, everyone. How's it going? This is a bit of a different video today.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,200
We're going to be talking about the Project Veritas Exposing Google

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,440
Political Bias video that came out on June 25th.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,320
Now, those of you who don't know,

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,880
this video has basically been banned from the entire Internet.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,560
They won't let you talk about it on Facebook or Twitter.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,600
It's certainly not up on YouTube. You can't talk about it on Reddit.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
The only place you can find it, in fact, is on Bitchute.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,400
And that's where I'm watching it now.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,760
Also, you can't even upload parts of it or clips of it to YouTube to talk about.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,440
You can talk about it on YouTube because Tim Pool and V and others

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,280
have talked about it on YouTube, but you can't upload clips of it or images.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,880
I don't even think you can upload audio of it.

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,240
So here's what we're going to do.

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
We're going to watch this video.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,840
You may follow along.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,040
And when I pause to commentate, you will see a timestamp.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Make sure to be watching it on Bitchute.

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,560
It's pretty easy to find there. So.

20
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,360
Let's begin.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,000
OK, I skipped ahead to one minute and fifty six seconds,

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,200
just because the first two minutes of the thing is basically

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,840
like a trailer or a teaser for what's inside of it. So let's go.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,080
I personally don't think it's Google's place

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,080
to be preventing what happened in 2016.

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,600
People voted. People voted for Trump. Trump won.

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,240
People didn't want Hillary.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,120
It's not Google's place to put a president into power.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,080
So, yeah, it sounds like Google was all for free speech

30
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,240
until it swung against their way.

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,720
They definitely enjoyed the benefits of it when progressivism was on the rise.

32
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,800
But now that centrism and even rightism is on the rise, they want to stifle it.

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,720
They want to control everyone online.

34
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,320
This is almost like an emperor has no clothes situation.

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,920
Everyone was willing to play the game with Google and with Facebook

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,120
and with Twitter. But as soon as Trump won, all bets were off.

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,840
The way this woman talks,

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,000
it sounds like she really does live in that Southern California bubble,

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,960
doesn't it? Like she's she's talking about fairness

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,280
as if it's something that everyone agrees on, like it's a settled issue.

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Like, oh, who would disagree with my idea of fairness

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,080
helping marginalized communities like obviously that's fair, right?

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,040
My subjective definition, that's obviously what's correct.

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,040
And everyone should listen to it, right?

45
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,160
It's almost like she hasn't ever left her bubble.

46
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,200
So she has no idea.

47
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,440
She hasn't even conceived of people objecting to her or why they might.

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,960
What good reasons they might have for objecting to her definition of fairness.

49
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,800
And moreover, again, it's not really Google's job to do any of this.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,440
Use A.I. to tweak algorithms for fairness, for your idea of fairness

51
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,880
regarding marginalized communities.

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,520
It's it's insane. It's insanity.

53
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,200
So so basically exactly what we've all been saying this whole time.

54
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,040
They have no problem with suppressing speech and putting forward

55
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,560
their subjective ideas if it prevents Trump, if it prevents Brexit,

56
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
if it prevents Gamergate, probably.

57
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,560
I'm sure there are some people in Google who are still crying over Gamergate.

58
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,880
This is not the place of a private company.

59
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,400
Hold on, we got to try this.

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,560
We got to hold on a second. Let's go.

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,240
Here we go. Google,

62
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,400
google.com. Women can.

63
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,960
Women Canada soccer, women cancer, women can fly, women can do it.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,880
Women canvas shoes, vote, do anything, be drafted.

65
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,680
OK, men can have babies.

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,320
Men can get pregnant and babies now.

67
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,120
Yeah. Jesus, it actually actually works port inappropriate predictions.

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,920
How about fucking all of them?

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,200
So hold on, hold on.

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,280
Algorithmic unfairness specifically refers to things that are true,

71
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,840
but they don't like politically.

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,200
So the whole 12 percent, 51 percent statistic.

73
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,680
You know, that's algorithmic unfairness, it's the truth,

74
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,920
but that's not the world as they want to see it, so they're going to censor it.

75
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,840
Is that what we're talking about here or the whole male CEOs thing?

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,440
Why there are a lot of Jewish people in the one percent?

77
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,800
I wonder if they're applying algorithmic unfairness to things that that do not

78
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,480
benefit these minorities or these protected classes like like male suicide

79
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,160
or something, are they going to show more pictures of female suicides

80
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,600
just just to equal it out?

81
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,480
I mean, probably not.

82
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,400
Product intervention.

83
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,200
See, I remember

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,880
some people were talking about how like selling your data isn't a big deal.

85
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,200
You know, what does it matter if Facebook and Amazon and Google,

86
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,920
you know, install cookies onto your computer and track what you're doing

87
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,760
and track your purchases and sell that data to other companies?

88
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,000
What does it matter?

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,560
Well, sorry, I'm still a little bit sick.

90
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,120
Well, it matters because you have to be able to

91
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,400
freely think.

92
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,280
And if you have an idea

93
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,600
and you know, it's maybe it's like a half articulated idea

94
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,840
and you want to go look it up

95
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,840
or you want to see if somebody else has an idea

96
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,320
or you want to post it on a form

97
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,440
or you want to maybe search up some terms related to the idea

98
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,000
and see if you can figure a few things out and get to the bottom of something.

99
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,400
If Google actively fights against you, because that's an idea

100
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,360
that they have not approved or that they explicitly disapprove of.

101
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,960
That's social engineering. That's actively.

102
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,880
I mean, I don't know if it really qualifies as

103
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,040
infringing on your rights because they're a private company

104
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,680
and they do have rights themselves.

105
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,800
But it's certainly social engineering.

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,920
And I don't think I have to say this, but but that is a bad thing.

107
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,200
That's frankly, it's an evil thing.

108
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,600
If Google understands that there's a set of ideas

109
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,440
that if they remain unarticulated, they they become weak

110
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,840
in people's minds and they can easily kind of steamroll them

111
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,480
with with collectivized thought or with propaganda or whatever.

112
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,080
And if they can prevent people from properly articulating those ideas

113
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,480
through censorship and they and they have the willingness to do that.

114
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,320
That's evil. That is pure evil.

115
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,800
And it's and frankly, it's it's anti-democratic.

116
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,920
We can't be evil because we have defined ourselves as good.

117
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,320
Holy fuck. OK.

118
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,560
This is why every single independent news or political channel on YouTube

119
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,600
is is getting throttled in place of of CNN and MSNBC and ABC and others.

120
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,720
I mean, I did that video yesterday where I kind of showed that

121
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,160
there was Bloomberg with 111 hits in 52 minutes,

122
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,160
and I blew past that in about 10 minutes on that video.

123
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,600
So it's very clear what they're choosing for trending.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,200
It's not actually trends.

125
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,280
I think we can kind of see this to be true.

126
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,120
For example, compare Christ Church, the Christ Church massacre

127
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,120
and how social media responded and the news media responded.

128
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,080
Compare that with the attack on the ice facility just a couple of days ago.

129
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,440
Christ Church was all over the news, all over the mainstream media.

130
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,920
It was on Google and YouTube,

131
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,200
but only sources that were, say, roundly condemning them

132
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,360
and also blaming the entire conservative sphere.

133
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,240
And frankly, the centrist and center left sphere as well

134
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,720
for Christ Church blaming everything under the sun.

135
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,280
You got video games, you got 4chan, you got memes, you got the Internet,

136
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,800
you got everything but the SJW is blaming it all on everything.

137
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,320
The whole Christ Church thing.

138
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,440
And that's what was pushed.

139
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,960
That's what was pushed to the front page.

140
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,600
Those videos from those networks are pushed to the front page.

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,200
That was the allowed opinion on Twitter and Facebook.

142
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,520
But compare that to the ice facility attack.

143
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,920
People are praising that guy for his terrorism.

144
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,760
Doesn't seem to matter.

145
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,080
No one's getting banned for it.

146
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,160
Videos aren't getting taken.

147
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,440
Videos of people praising him, they're not getting taken down.

148
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,520
The media is largely silent.

149
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,840
Nothing is getting pushed.

150
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,960
And when the mainstream media does talk about it,

151
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,880
they don't mention Antifa, even though he was a member of Antifa

152
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,920
and he talks about Antifa in his manifesto.

153
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,600
And all of that is, again, what Google pushes on YouTube and other places.

154
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,480
It's obvious who these guys play for.

155
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,320
Holy shit, they actually have people are programmed.

156
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Really, is that remember Google?

157
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,240
Google's Google's catchphrase was, don't be evil.

158
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,960
Programming people is pretty much the definition of evil.

159
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,640
That's incredible.

160
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,640
The the complete disdain they have for the legitimate government

161
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,080
of their own country is wild.

162
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,200
The representatives of the people, they don't care.

163
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,240
They want to fuck the people.

164
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,320
They don't want to be accountable to them.

165
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,120
Oh, my God, I can't believe I have to say this.

166
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,760
It's not Google's place to prevent Trump 2020.

167
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,360
If you OK, if you want Trump to not get elected again,

168
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,720
put forward somebody who can actually beat him.

169
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,520
That's it. That's how you win.

170
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,560
It's not through all this social engineering bullshit here.

171
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,680
Here you want to beat Trump?

172
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,400
Put forward Tulsi Gabbard.

173
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,680
There you go. Stop being cucks.

174
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,320
Democrats, stop being cucks.

175
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,960
Put forward Tulsi Gabbard.

176
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,680
She's the only one who's going to beat Trump.

177
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,120
Everyone else is a loser.

178
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Hold on a minute. That can't be true.

179
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,200
Hillary Clinton's emails.

180
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,760
Yeah, nothing.

181
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,640
How about just like Clinton emails?

182
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,040
Clinton emails.

183
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,040
Well, there's a few things.

184
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,680
Data set.

185
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,720
OK, well, maybe, hmm, I don't know what Trump's

186
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,760
emails. No, nothing for Trump's emails either.

187
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,600
I don't know about this one.

188
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,280
Yeah, see, it's it's one thing to put forward

189
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,240
a preferred point of view.

190
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,120
It's another thing entirely to delete points of view,

191
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,680
because like the first one's bad enough.

192
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,720
The second one is abominable.

193
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,840
I think about it this way.

194
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,440
OK, you have preferred speech.

195
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,680
You know, you can say whatever you want,

196
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,960
but the government or whoever prefers that you would say this.

197
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,280
But you can say whatever you want. OK.

198
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,440
At least then you have the choice to take in their in their view,

199
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,520
the less optimum route.

200
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,640
You still have the choice as a free person.

201
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,520
However, when you only have the choice to do what they want,

202
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,160
that's compelled speech.

203
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,240
That's a very different situation.

204
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,840
I know that this isn't strictly that.

205
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,080
You know, this is not like you can't search for Hillary Clinton's emails.

206
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,040
You very obviously can.

207
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,640
It's just not going to auto complete.

208
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,880
So it's not straight up compelled speech,

209
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,000
but they are kind of shepherding you in that direction.

210
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,600
It's like it's like the first baby steps leading to compelled speech,

211
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,840
which is absolutely terrifying.

212
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,960
I did a video on this.

213
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,080
This is unfortunately not true, but it's a very popular misconception.

214
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,720
Even even Senator Ted Cruz in his grilling of somebody at Google

215
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,200
after this video came out, even he repeated this.

216
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,280
It is not the case that Section 230 requires them to be impartial.

217
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,240
And there's actually an amendment

218
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,400
coming forward from a Republican that wants to make it so.

219
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,200
And hopefully they do.

220
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,800
I have to admit, I haven't seen this,

221
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,840
but I think I'm too small to be affected by it.

222
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,960
You know, my videos might get 10, 20, sometimes 30,000,

223
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
maybe six figures.

224
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,160
If it's if it's a really good one or one that goes viral.

225
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,440
I've had that happen a handful of times, but it stayed around that that point.

226
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,480
Maybe they still think that I'm an anime channel.

227
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,520
You know, the name Shortfire Otaku kind of kind of lends itself to it.

228
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,560
Maybe I'm flying into the radar. Who knows?

229
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,280
Oh, my God, Dave, Dave Rubin has right wing.

230
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,440
I mean, if anything, he's like slightly right of center.

231
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,840
Tim Pool is definitely not right wing.

232
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,760
He's center left. He's like me.

233
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,440
I'm a center lefty, too.

234
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,800
I think for them, the Overton window has shifted so far

235
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,000
that right wing is just whatever is not them.

236
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,720
OK, that that that that that's a meme.

237
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,640
OK, that's a meme.

238
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,720
Um, I do have to say this about 1984 at this point.

239
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,720
Read another book just like Harry Potter.

240
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,360
Read another book.

241
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,720
So there we are. That was it.

242
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,680
Um, I don't know if there's much else to say, my friends, like.

243
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,240
This is all stuff we knew was was happening,

244
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,120
but it's something else to hear it straight from the horse's mouth.

245
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,360
It's kind of like with CNN member Veritas did, I think,

246
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,840
back during the 2016 election.

247
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,120
They got somebody from CNN to laugh at the idea of ethics

248
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,480
and talk about how their business and they're they're there to push Hillary.

249
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,640
That was a Veritas leak as well.

250
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,400
And we all knew that was the case.

251
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,440
But again, it was important to hear it from the horse's mouth.

252
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,440
And that's what this is.

253
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,040
I think it's going to get worse.

254
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,960
I think Google is going to crack down through YouTube

255
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,080
is going to crack down on all of us.

256
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,520
They will probably eventually come for me.

257
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,160
I know I haven't shown a single thing from the actual video.

258
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,280
I've only talked about it, but they'll probably still find a way.

259
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
This will be up on Bitchute, though, as always.

260
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,320
And frankly, at this point, we just have to hope that

261
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,480
that Trump can do something before he's he's voted out.

262
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,920
Like if Google has their way, it won't be Trump in 2020.

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,880
So something has to be done about this.

264
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,480
This is this is quite literally destroying the Internet

265
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,440
and not just the Internet, but also American politics.

266
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,520
And on a more personal note,

267
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,920
it's destroying the reason why I wanted to be a YouTuber in the first place,

268
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
because I actually believed in the platform

269
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,680
and in the idea of directly communicating with an audience.

270
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,200
Google is literally fucking everything and everyone

271
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,640
for their own personal benefit.

272
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,080
And it's got to stop.

273
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,720
I don't know if there's anything more to say than that.

274
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,880
It's got to stop.

275
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,960
I thank you very much for watching.

276
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,800
Thank you very much for supporting me.

277
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,560
If you feel like supporting me financially,

278
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,840
there's SubscribeStar at SubscribeStar.com

279
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,120
For a one time tip, there's always PayPal.me

280
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,560
and as I like to commonly point out,

281
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,800
I have a gaming channel called Game Boomers.

282
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,120
I stream on it every night, twitch.tv slash Game Boomers,

283
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,800
and I upload the the stream archives to YouTube.com slash Game Boomer.

284
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,200
Any one of those things where there's donations

285
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,600
or supporting side projects or supporting even just SFO generally,

286
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,000
they all help me out.

287
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,680
So I've got another video coming out a little bit later in the week,

288
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,880
and I'm probably going to go start working on that right now.

289
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,400
In any case, I'll catch you later. I love you.
