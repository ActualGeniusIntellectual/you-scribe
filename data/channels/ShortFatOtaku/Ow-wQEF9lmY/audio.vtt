WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Just so we're clear, I pirate stuff sometimes. And honestly, you'd be hard pressed to find

00:04.400 --> 00:09.360
somebody that hasn't downloaded a movie, game, or bit of software at least once in their lives.

00:09.360 --> 00:13.280
I'm one of the millions of people who haven't paid a cent for any of Game of Thrones.

00:13.280 --> 00:18.000
And somebody from HBO has been quoted saying that Game of Thrones is the most pirated show

00:18.000 --> 00:22.320
in the world, and that's better than an Emmy. During the days of Napster MP3 downloads,

00:22.320 --> 00:27.520
the prevailing idea among out-of-touch corporate suits was that every download was a lost sale.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.720
This mentality led to Metallica killing Napster in court.

00:30.720 --> 00:35.600
But clearly common thought has evolved since then, if HBO's attitude is to be believed.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.320
People now recognize that, while it's obviously better if people pay for the content they consume,

00:40.320 --> 00:43.760
piracy is what gives properties the push to enter the zeitgeist.

00:43.760 --> 00:48.800
Game of Thrones may be the most pirated TV show in history, but it's also the most popular TV show in

00:48.800 --> 00:53.600
history. And that popularity stemmed from so many people watching it and talking about it and

00:53.600 --> 00:57.040
sharing it with their friends, even though some of them just couldn't afford it.

00:57.040 --> 01:00.320
I usually argue against the idea of paying somebody an exposure,

01:00.320 --> 01:04.080
but when millions of people do it simultaneously, yeah, it can be worth something.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.560
There will always be a percentage of people who pirate stuff,

01:06.560 --> 01:08.800
because they can't afford it or they just don't care.

01:08.800 --> 01:12.560
And although there's certainly efforts to stamp out piracy, the smarter publishers are

01:12.560 --> 01:16.720
silently turning a blind eye to all but the most egregious offenses, because they understand that

01:16.720 --> 01:20.720
the underground community nourishes their brand culturally, if not financially.

01:20.720 --> 01:25.040
But a good company with a quality product and honest business practices can generally

01:25.040 --> 01:27.920
keep the percentage of people who pirate its products at a minimum.

01:27.920 --> 01:32.560
A good example of this would be Sony from the launch of the PS4 up until the past 6 months or so,

01:32.560 --> 01:34.560
or Nintendo since the launch of the Switch.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.040
The behavior of these companies during those time periods,

01:37.040 --> 01:41.600
along with quality goods and services, helped cement a lasting brand loyalty.

01:41.600 --> 01:45.760
Compare this with a company like Blizzard. For example, in order to chat in the Overwatch

01:45.760 --> 01:49.600
League live chat room during the games, you have to link up your Battle.net account with

01:49.600 --> 01:52.960
your Twitch account. Once they're linked, Blizzard can keep an eye on your account

01:52.960 --> 01:56.640
for what they consider to be toxic behavior in Twitch channels other than their own.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.680
And if you're caught, you're banned. Blizzard has also decided to ban people

01:59.680 --> 02:03.520
from Battle.net if they can trace toxic YouTube comments back to their accounts.

02:03.520 --> 02:08.560
By the way, these bans? If you've got games on Battle.net that you've purchased, kiss them goodbye.

02:08.560 --> 02:12.880
Just so we're clear here, if you buy a legitimate copy of Overwatch on Battle.net,

02:12.880 --> 02:17.360
and then say something that Blizzard can deem hateful or offensive by their estimation

02:17.360 --> 02:20.560
on other platforms, you lose the copy of the game you bought.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.560
The same thing is happening with Sony, by the way.

02:22.560 --> 02:26.640
I did say earlier that up until the past six months or so, Sony's been pretty good.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.240
Well, nowadays, if you violate Sony's hate speech policy,

02:30.240 --> 02:33.600
you will lose your entire library of games on the PlayStation 4.

02:33.600 --> 02:36.800
It doesn't matter that you bought them, or that you consider them your property,

02:36.800 --> 02:41.280
they just get taken away because fuck you. That, combined with Sony's recent censorship of

02:41.280 --> 02:46.400
games that contain sexual content, and by sexual I mean anime girls in bikinis at the beach,

02:46.400 --> 02:50.480
yeah, nobody likes Sony too much right now. But this isn't just a video game issue.

02:50.480 --> 02:54.400
When Netflix was the top dog in the streaming world, everybody just got a Netflix account.

02:54.400 --> 02:58.400
And when Netflix started producing exclusive content, it was a welcome surprise.

02:58.400 --> 03:02.880
But then competitors like Crave or Amazon TV or Hulu started showing up,

03:02.880 --> 03:05.360
and they all started producing exclusive content as well.

03:05.360 --> 03:09.600
You would be hard-pressed to find somebody that isn't at least mildly interested in one

03:09.600 --> 03:13.520
exclusive show on each of these services, and you'd be equally hard-pressed to find

03:13.520 --> 03:16.960
somebody willing to pay monthly fees for like 10 different streaming accounts

03:16.960 --> 03:19.440
just to watch the exclusives. So guess what happened?

03:19.440 --> 03:23.840
Piracy is on the rise again. My generation left cable TV behind for a reason.

03:23.840 --> 03:27.840
We're not going to pay the same amount or more our parents did each month in the form

03:27.840 --> 03:31.840
of subscribing to a handful of redundant services simply for one or two exclusives.

03:31.840 --> 03:35.840
Most people will simply pay for the service they use the most, and pirate the rest.

03:35.840 --> 03:41.040
At best, they'll buy one month of a service, binge-watch all the exclusive content on it,

03:41.040 --> 03:42.480
and then immediately cancel.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.200
Think about it. Game of Thrones is exclusive to HBO.

03:45.200 --> 03:49.040
House of Cards is exclusive to Netflix. Jack Ryan is exclusive to Amazon TV.

03:49.040 --> 03:52.800
Handmaid's Tale is on Hulu. Star Trek Discovery is on CBS All Access.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.560
Disney has decided to remove all of its stuff from competitors in order to start up a Disney

03:56.560 --> 03:58.960
exclusive service. Apple's starting something up too.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.320
YouTube Premium's got its own shows. Nobody's going to pay for all this.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.880
They'll pick the one they're using the most and pirate the rest.

04:04.880 --> 04:08.640
There's a legitimate conundrum here, and it's one that the libertarian and free-market

04:08.640 --> 04:11.280
capitalist types just don't have the tools to solve.

04:11.280 --> 04:16.400
A completely free market with no regulation will begin in a state of fierce competition,

04:16.400 --> 04:20.320
naturally gravitate towards monopoly. And once a strong monopoly has been achieved,

04:20.320 --> 04:25.200
the owner of the monopoly will use its resources and influence to raise the cost of entry to the

04:25.200 --> 04:28.480
industry so high that no competitor could ever hope to topple them.

04:28.480 --> 04:31.840
And then they'll begin to massively abuse their customer base because hey,

04:31.840 --> 04:34.720
where else are you going to go for the product or service? They've got the monopoly.

04:34.720 --> 04:39.520
If the companies involved are not honest, both market states are toxic to consumers.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.920
Like I just said, a monopoly run by a dishonest company will exploit its consumers knowing they

04:43.920 --> 04:47.920
have no escape. But a competitive market filled with dishonest companies will either run a cartel

04:47.920 --> 04:50.880
like internet providers do, preventing infrastructure growth in the process,

04:50.880 --> 04:54.160
or their competition will come in the form of exclusivity enforced by

04:54.160 --> 04:56.720
offering services rather than offering ownership.

04:56.720 --> 05:01.520
Here's what I mean. I use Adobe Premiere Pro 5.5 to edit my videos.

05:01.520 --> 05:05.920
Adobe Premiere Pro 6 has been out for a while, and I absolutely refuse to upgrade.

05:05.920 --> 05:09.520
Why? Because the sixth edition line of all of Adobe's software,

05:09.520 --> 05:15.360
called Creative Suite 6, isn't actually purchasable. With CS 5.5, you buy the software

05:15.360 --> 05:21.120
and you own it. It's yours. But you can't buy CS 6. CS 6 is offered as a monthly subscription.

05:21.120 --> 05:25.040
You never buy the rights to own a copy of the software. You never have ownership of what you've

05:25.040 --> 05:29.440
bought. You buy the right to use their software for a month, with a monthly fee. They're not

05:29.440 --> 05:33.760
offering ownership, they're offering a service. That's why Sony can get away with taking all your

05:33.760 --> 05:38.320
PS4 games, if you're banned for saying naughty words. You've never really bought the games.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.840
You've bought the right to play them, a right that Sony can revoke at any time.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.760
You don't actually own anything. Imagine you went to IKEA and picked up a table,

05:45.760 --> 05:49.040
only you don't actually own the table. You own the right to borrow the table from IKEA to put

05:49.040 --> 05:53.120
it in your kitchen and to eat off of it. But IKEA can come and take it back from you at any time,

05:53.120 --> 05:57.200
should you do something they don't like. That sounds insane, but things are actually trending

05:57.200 --> 06:01.840
that way. For example, the right to repair battle revolves around whether or not people should have

06:01.840 --> 06:06.160
the right to repair or modify smartphones after they buy them. The terms of service that Apple,

06:06.160 --> 06:10.960
Samsung, and others employ strictly outlines that by buying their phones, you don't have the right

06:10.960 --> 06:15.120
to do certain things with them, lest you void their warranty. This goes against both American

06:15.120 --> 06:19.280
and Canadian law, stating that warranties can only be voided through tampering if the company

06:19.280 --> 06:24.080
provides free repairs. But so far, those laws have not been enforced. And new legislation designed to

06:24.080 --> 06:28.640
allow people to tamper with their property as they see fit has been consistently lobbied against by,

06:28.640 --> 06:34.400
you guessed it, Apple and Samsung. This is the first step on the road to devices as a service,

06:34.400 --> 06:39.760
a phenomenon where you don't actually own that phone, tablet, or computer. You simply rent it

06:39.760 --> 06:44.560
from the company for a monthly fee. You don't own that application, movie, or game. You just get

06:44.560 --> 06:49.120
access to it for a monthly fee. And those who think this is a good thing offer up a convincing

06:49.120 --> 06:52.640
argument. When something goes wrong, it's not your fault to fix it, as long as you haven't tampered

06:52.640 --> 06:56.480
with the device, of course. For small companies renting software and hardware, they don't need

06:56.480 --> 07:00.240
IT departments to constantly manage their infrastructure. Replacement is inexpensive,

07:00.240 --> 07:04.240
perhaps even free. And although those are perks that ownership can't provide,

07:04.240 --> 07:08.800
this is just a technological variant of the same old argument of freedom versus security.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.960
Do you want the freedom to own your own stuff, with the responsibility to fix it placed on your

07:12.960 --> 07:17.040
shoulders? Or do you want a company to own everything that you use, but you're off the hook

07:17.040 --> 07:20.960
when things go south? Personally, I'll choose freedom every time, and I do it because I don't

07:20.960 --> 07:24.400
know where this is going to stop. What if Microsoft or Google decide to take ownership

07:24.400 --> 07:28.480
of the novel that you write, because you write it on Word or Google Docs? What if companies use

07:28.480 --> 07:32.560
sensitive data in ways that you wouldn't want used, but you have no ownership over it so you

07:32.560 --> 07:37.440
can't stop it? Oh wait, this stuff is already starting to happen. So on the one hand, you have

07:37.440 --> 07:41.760
the brutalization of the monopoly, where a shitty corporation destroys all legitimate competition

07:41.760 --> 07:45.840
and then turns the screws on its consumers. On the other hand, you have a gaggle of competing

07:45.840 --> 07:50.800
companies who, in an attempt to get ahead, employ all manners of awful business practices. I know,

07:50.800 --> 07:54.640
I'm sounding like a socialist here. But you can be a capitalist and still see that this is a huge

07:54.640 --> 07:58.800
problem. Property rights are the great equalizer. Companies own what they produce, and people own

07:58.800 --> 08:02.640
what they buy. But companies have realized that if they stop selling what they produce,

08:02.640 --> 08:06.640
and simply rent it out, then the people have no rights because they're not buying any property

08:06.640 --> 08:10.880
at all. There's two solutions, as far as I can see. One is to support companies that have good

08:10.880 --> 08:14.960
business practices. Steam is still pretty good, and the marketplace has rewarded them well.

08:14.960 --> 08:19.040
Epic's been throwing that Chinese money around in an effort to dethrone Steam from the top spot,

08:19.040 --> 08:22.400
and considering that the Epic store is implementing almost every single shitty

08:22.400 --> 08:25.680
business practice I've talked about today, that's all the more reason to reject them.

08:25.680 --> 08:30.000
The consumer boycott is powerful. Vote with your wallet. But the second solution comes into play

08:30.000 --> 08:35.120
when the consumer boycott isn't working. Pirate fucking everything. And I do not say that lightly.

08:35.120 --> 08:39.360
I know how much damage rampant piracy can do to an industry. I know it breaks good,

08:39.360 --> 08:43.200
reasonable laws. I know it can fuck over people who are trying to make an honest living. If you

08:43.200 --> 08:47.760
can support a good company offering a fair price, do it. But piracy will always be an option,

08:47.760 --> 08:51.600
and it always should be an option, because we absolutely cannot let this whole

08:51.600 --> 08:56.640
everything-as-a-service garbage slip by unopposed. If companies, especially monopolies,

08:56.640 --> 09:00.640
will not play fair, if they continue to stand between the people and property rights,

09:00.640 --> 09:04.960
then we have a duty to bleed them dry. Hey Adobe, I pirated CS6,

09:04.960 --> 09:08.080
and it's still not as good as 5.5. You're a fucking joke.
