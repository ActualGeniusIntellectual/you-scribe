0	4400	Just so we're clear, I pirate stuff sometimes. And honestly, you'd be hard pressed to find
4400	9360	somebody that hasn't downloaded a movie, game, or bit of software at least once in their lives.
9360	13280	I'm one of the millions of people who haven't paid a cent for any of Game of Thrones.
13280	18000	And somebody from HBO has been quoted saying that Game of Thrones is the most pirated show
18000	22320	in the world, and that's better than an Emmy. During the days of Napster MP3 downloads,
22320	27520	the prevailing idea among out-of-touch corporate suits was that every download was a lost sale.
27520	30720	This mentality led to Metallica killing Napster in court.
30720	35600	But clearly common thought has evolved since then, if HBO's attitude is to be believed.
35600	40320	People now recognize that, while it's obviously better if people pay for the content they consume,
40320	43760	piracy is what gives properties the push to enter the zeitgeist.
43760	48800	Game of Thrones may be the most pirated TV show in history, but it's also the most popular TV show in
48800	53600	history. And that popularity stemmed from so many people watching it and talking about it and
53600	57040	sharing it with their friends, even though some of them just couldn't afford it.
57040	60320	I usually argue against the idea of paying somebody an exposure,
60320	64080	but when millions of people do it simultaneously, yeah, it can be worth something.
64080	66560	There will always be a percentage of people who pirate stuff,
66560	68800	because they can't afford it or they just don't care.
68800	72560	And although there's certainly efforts to stamp out piracy, the smarter publishers are
72560	76720	silently turning a blind eye to all but the most egregious offenses, because they understand that
76720	80720	the underground community nourishes their brand culturally, if not financially.
80720	85040	But a good company with a quality product and honest business practices can generally
85040	87920	keep the percentage of people who pirate its products at a minimum.
87920	92560	A good example of this would be Sony from the launch of the PS4 up until the past 6 months or so,
92560	94560	or Nintendo since the launch of the Switch.
94560	97040	The behavior of these companies during those time periods,
97040	101600	along with quality goods and services, helped cement a lasting brand loyalty.
101600	105760	Compare this with a company like Blizzard. For example, in order to chat in the Overwatch
105760	109600	League live chat room during the games, you have to link up your Battle.net account with
109600	112960	your Twitch account. Once they're linked, Blizzard can keep an eye on your account
112960	116640	for what they consider to be toxic behavior in Twitch channels other than their own.
116640	119680	And if you're caught, you're banned. Blizzard has also decided to ban people
119680	123520	from Battle.net if they can trace toxic YouTube comments back to their accounts.
123520	128560	By the way, these bans? If you've got games on Battle.net that you've purchased, kiss them goodbye.
128560	132880	Just so we're clear here, if you buy a legitimate copy of Overwatch on Battle.net,
132880	137360	and then say something that Blizzard can deem hateful or offensive by their estimation
137360	140560	on other platforms, you lose the copy of the game you bought.
140560	142560	The same thing is happening with Sony, by the way.
142560	146640	I did say earlier that up until the past six months or so, Sony's been pretty good.
146640	150240	Well, nowadays, if you violate Sony's hate speech policy,
150240	153600	you will lose your entire library of games on the PlayStation 4.
153600	156800	It doesn't matter that you bought them, or that you consider them your property,
156800	161280	they just get taken away because fuck you. That, combined with Sony's recent censorship of
161280	166400	games that contain sexual content, and by sexual I mean anime girls in bikinis at the beach,
166400	170480	yeah, nobody likes Sony too much right now. But this isn't just a video game issue.
170480	174400	When Netflix was the top dog in the streaming world, everybody just got a Netflix account.
174400	178400	And when Netflix started producing exclusive content, it was a welcome surprise.
178400	182880	But then competitors like Crave or Amazon TV or Hulu started showing up,
182880	185360	and they all started producing exclusive content as well.
185360	189600	You would be hard-pressed to find somebody that isn't at least mildly interested in one
189600	193520	exclusive show on each of these services, and you'd be equally hard-pressed to find
193520	196960	somebody willing to pay monthly fees for like 10 different streaming accounts
196960	199440	just to watch the exclusives. So guess what happened?
199440	203840	Piracy is on the rise again. My generation left cable TV behind for a reason.
203840	207840	We're not going to pay the same amount or more our parents did each month in the form
207840	211840	of subscribing to a handful of redundant services simply for one or two exclusives.
211840	215840	Most people will simply pay for the service they use the most, and pirate the rest.
215840	221040	At best, they'll buy one month of a service, binge-watch all the exclusive content on it,
221040	222480	and then immediately cancel.
222480	225200	Think about it. Game of Thrones is exclusive to HBO.
225200	229040	House of Cards is exclusive to Netflix. Jack Ryan is exclusive to Amazon TV.
229040	232800	Handmaid's Tale is on Hulu. Star Trek Discovery is on CBS All Access.
232800	236560	Disney has decided to remove all of its stuff from competitors in order to start up a Disney
236560	238960	exclusive service. Apple's starting something up too.
238960	242320	YouTube Premium's got its own shows. Nobody's going to pay for all this.
242320	244880	They'll pick the one they're using the most and pirate the rest.
244880	248640	There's a legitimate conundrum here, and it's one that the libertarian and free-market
248640	251280	capitalist types just don't have the tools to solve.
251280	256400	A completely free market with no regulation will begin in a state of fierce competition,
256400	260320	naturally gravitate towards monopoly. And once a strong monopoly has been achieved,
260320	265200	the owner of the monopoly will use its resources and influence to raise the cost of entry to the
265200	268480	industry so high that no competitor could ever hope to topple them.
268480	271840	And then they'll begin to massively abuse their customer base because hey,
271840	274720	where else are you going to go for the product or service? They've got the monopoly.
274720	279520	If the companies involved are not honest, both market states are toxic to consumers.
279520	283920	Like I just said, a monopoly run by a dishonest company will exploit its consumers knowing they
283920	287920	have no escape. But a competitive market filled with dishonest companies will either run a cartel
287920	290880	like internet providers do, preventing infrastructure growth in the process,
290880	294160	or their competition will come in the form of exclusivity enforced by
294160	296720	offering services rather than offering ownership.
296720	301520	Here's what I mean. I use Adobe Premiere Pro 5.5 to edit my videos.
301520	305920	Adobe Premiere Pro 6 has been out for a while, and I absolutely refuse to upgrade.
305920	309520	Why? Because the sixth edition line of all of Adobe's software,
309520	315360	called Creative Suite 6, isn't actually purchasable. With CS 5.5, you buy the software
315360	321120	and you own it. It's yours. But you can't buy CS 6. CS 6 is offered as a monthly subscription.
321120	325040	You never buy the rights to own a copy of the software. You never have ownership of what you've
325040	329440	bought. You buy the right to use their software for a month, with a monthly fee. They're not
329440	333760	offering ownership, they're offering a service. That's why Sony can get away with taking all your
333760	338320	PS4 games, if you're banned for saying naughty words. You've never really bought the games.
338320	341840	You've bought the right to play them, a right that Sony can revoke at any time.
341840	345760	You don't actually own anything. Imagine you went to IKEA and picked up a table,
345760	349040	only you don't actually own the table. You own the right to borrow the table from IKEA to put
349040	353120	it in your kitchen and to eat off of it. But IKEA can come and take it back from you at any time,
353120	357200	should you do something they don't like. That sounds insane, but things are actually trending
357200	361840	that way. For example, the right to repair battle revolves around whether or not people should have
361840	366160	the right to repair or modify smartphones after they buy them. The terms of service that Apple,
366160	370960	Samsung, and others employ strictly outlines that by buying their phones, you don't have the right
370960	375120	to do certain things with them, lest you void their warranty. This goes against both American
375120	379280	and Canadian law, stating that warranties can only be voided through tampering if the company
379280	384080	provides free repairs. But so far, those laws have not been enforced. And new legislation designed to
384080	388640	allow people to tamper with their property as they see fit has been consistently lobbied against by,
388640	394400	you guessed it, Apple and Samsung. This is the first step on the road to devices as a service,
394400	399760	a phenomenon where you don't actually own that phone, tablet, or computer. You simply rent it
399760	404560	from the company for a monthly fee. You don't own that application, movie, or game. You just get
404560	409120	access to it for a monthly fee. And those who think this is a good thing offer up a convincing
409120	412640	argument. When something goes wrong, it's not your fault to fix it, as long as you haven't tampered
412640	416480	with the device, of course. For small companies renting software and hardware, they don't need
416480	420240	IT departments to constantly manage their infrastructure. Replacement is inexpensive,
420240	424240	perhaps even free. And although those are perks that ownership can't provide,
424240	428800	this is just a technological variant of the same old argument of freedom versus security.
428800	432960	Do you want the freedom to own your own stuff, with the responsibility to fix it placed on your
432960	437040	shoulders? Or do you want a company to own everything that you use, but you're off the hook
437040	440960	when things go south? Personally, I'll choose freedom every time, and I do it because I don't
440960	444400	know where this is going to stop. What if Microsoft or Google decide to take ownership
444400	448480	of the novel that you write, because you write it on Word or Google Docs? What if companies use
448480	452560	sensitive data in ways that you wouldn't want used, but you have no ownership over it so you
452560	457440	can't stop it? Oh wait, this stuff is already starting to happen. So on the one hand, you have
457440	461760	the brutalization of the monopoly, where a shitty corporation destroys all legitimate competition
461760	465840	and then turns the screws on its consumers. On the other hand, you have a gaggle of competing
465840	470800	companies who, in an attempt to get ahead, employ all manners of awful business practices. I know,
470800	474640	I'm sounding like a socialist here. But you can be a capitalist and still see that this is a huge
474640	478800	problem. Property rights are the great equalizer. Companies own what they produce, and people own
478800	482640	what they buy. But companies have realized that if they stop selling what they produce,
482640	486640	and simply rent it out, then the people have no rights because they're not buying any property
486640	490880	at all. There's two solutions, as far as I can see. One is to support companies that have good
490880	494960	business practices. Steam is still pretty good, and the marketplace has rewarded them well.
494960	499040	Epic's been throwing that Chinese money around in an effort to dethrone Steam from the top spot,
499040	502400	and considering that the Epic store is implementing almost every single shitty
502400	505680	business practice I've talked about today, that's all the more reason to reject them.
505680	510000	The consumer boycott is powerful. Vote with your wallet. But the second solution comes into play
510000	515120	when the consumer boycott isn't working. Pirate fucking everything. And I do not say that lightly.
515120	519360	I know how much damage rampant piracy can do to an industry. I know it breaks good,
519360	523200	reasonable laws. I know it can fuck over people who are trying to make an honest living. If you
523200	527760	can support a good company offering a fair price, do it. But piracy will always be an option,
527760	531600	and it always should be an option, because we absolutely cannot let this whole
531600	536640	everything-as-a-service garbage slip by unopposed. If companies, especially monopolies,
536640	540640	will not play fair, if they continue to stand between the people and property rights,
540640	544960	then we have a duty to bleed them dry. Hey Adobe, I pirated CS6,
544960	548080	and it's still not as good as 5.5. You're a fucking joke.
