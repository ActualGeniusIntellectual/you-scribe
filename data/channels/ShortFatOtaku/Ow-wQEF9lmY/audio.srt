1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Just so we're clear, I pirate stuff sometimes. And honestly, you'd be hard pressed to find

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,360
somebody that hasn't downloaded a movie, game, or bit of software at least once in their lives.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,280
I'm one of the millions of people who haven't paid a cent for any of Game of Thrones.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,000
And somebody from HBO has been quoted saying that Game of Thrones is the most pirated show

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,320
in the world, and that's better than an Emmy. During the days of Napster MP3 downloads,

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,520
the prevailing idea among out-of-touch corporate suits was that every download was a lost sale.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,720
This mentality led to Metallica killing Napster in court.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,600
But clearly common thought has evolved since then, if HBO's attitude is to be believed.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,320
People now recognize that, while it's obviously better if people pay for the content they consume,

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,760
piracy is what gives properties the push to enter the zeitgeist.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,800
Game of Thrones may be the most pirated TV show in history, but it's also the most popular TV show in

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,600
history. And that popularity stemmed from so many people watching it and talking about it and

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,040
sharing it with their friends, even though some of them just couldn't afford it.

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,320
I usually argue against the idea of paying somebody an exposure,

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,080
but when millions of people do it simultaneously, yeah, it can be worth something.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,560
There will always be a percentage of people who pirate stuff,

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,800
because they can't afford it or they just don't care.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,560
And although there's certainly efforts to stamp out piracy, the smarter publishers are

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,720
silently turning a blind eye to all but the most egregious offenses, because they understand that

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,720
the underground community nourishes their brand culturally, if not financially.

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,040
But a good company with a quality product and honest business practices can generally

22
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,920
keep the percentage of people who pirate its products at a minimum.

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,560
A good example of this would be Sony from the launch of the PS4 up until the past 6 months or so,

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
or Nintendo since the launch of the Switch.

25
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,040
The behavior of these companies during those time periods,

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,600
along with quality goods and services, helped cement a lasting brand loyalty.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,760
Compare this with a company like Blizzard. For example, in order to chat in the Overwatch

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,600
League live chat room during the games, you have to link up your Battle.net account with

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,960
your Twitch account. Once they're linked, Blizzard can keep an eye on your account

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,640
for what they consider to be toxic behavior in Twitch channels other than their own.

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,680
And if you're caught, you're banned. Blizzard has also decided to ban people

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,520
from Battle.net if they can trace toxic YouTube comments back to their accounts.

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,560
By the way, these bans? If you've got games on Battle.net that you've purchased, kiss them goodbye.

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,880
Just so we're clear here, if you buy a legitimate copy of Overwatch on Battle.net,

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,360
and then say something that Blizzard can deem hateful or offensive by their estimation

36
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,560
on other platforms, you lose the copy of the game you bought.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560
The same thing is happening with Sony, by the way.

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
I did say earlier that up until the past six months or so, Sony's been pretty good.

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,240
Well, nowadays, if you violate Sony's hate speech policy,

40
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,600
you will lose your entire library of games on the PlayStation 4.

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,800
It doesn't matter that you bought them, or that you consider them your property,

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,280
they just get taken away because fuck you. That, combined with Sony's recent censorship of

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,400
games that contain sexual content, and by sexual I mean anime girls in bikinis at the beach,

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,480
yeah, nobody likes Sony too much right now. But this isn't just a video game issue.

45
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,400
When Netflix was the top dog in the streaming world, everybody just got a Netflix account.

46
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
And when Netflix started producing exclusive content, it was a welcome surprise.

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,880
But then competitors like Crave or Amazon TV or Hulu started showing up,

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,360
and they all started producing exclusive content as well.

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,600
You would be hard-pressed to find somebody that isn't at least mildly interested in one

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,520
exclusive show on each of these services, and you'd be equally hard-pressed to find

51
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,960
somebody willing to pay monthly fees for like 10 different streaming accounts

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,440
just to watch the exclusives. So guess what happened?

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,840
Piracy is on the rise again. My generation left cable TV behind for a reason.

54
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,840
We're not going to pay the same amount or more our parents did each month in the form

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,840
of subscribing to a handful of redundant services simply for one or two exclusives.

56
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,840
Most people will simply pay for the service they use the most, and pirate the rest.

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,040
At best, they'll buy one month of a service, binge-watch all the exclusive content on it,

58
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,480
and then immediately cancel.

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,200
Think about it. Game of Thrones is exclusive to HBO.

60
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,040
House of Cards is exclusive to Netflix. Jack Ryan is exclusive to Amazon TV.

61
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,800
Handmaid's Tale is on Hulu. Star Trek Discovery is on CBS All Access.

62
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,560
Disney has decided to remove all of its stuff from competitors in order to start up a Disney

63
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,960
exclusive service. Apple's starting something up too.

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,320
YouTube Premium's got its own shows. Nobody's going to pay for all this.

65
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,880
They'll pick the one they're using the most and pirate the rest.

66
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,640
There's a legitimate conundrum here, and it's one that the libertarian and free-market

67
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,280
capitalist types just don't have the tools to solve.

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,400
A completely free market with no regulation will begin in a state of fierce competition,

69
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,320
naturally gravitate towards monopoly. And once a strong monopoly has been achieved,

70
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,200
the owner of the monopoly will use its resources and influence to raise the cost of entry to the

71
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,480
industry so high that no competitor could ever hope to topple them.

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,840
And then they'll begin to massively abuse their customer base because hey,

73
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,720
where else are you going to go for the product or service? They've got the monopoly.

74
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,520
If the companies involved are not honest, both market states are toxic to consumers.

75
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,920
Like I just said, a monopoly run by a dishonest company will exploit its consumers knowing they

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,920
have no escape. But a competitive market filled with dishonest companies will either run a cartel

77
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,880
like internet providers do, preventing infrastructure growth in the process,

78
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,160
or their competition will come in the form of exclusivity enforced by

79
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,720
offering services rather than offering ownership.

80
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,520
Here's what I mean. I use Adobe Premiere Pro 5.5 to edit my videos.

81
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,920
Adobe Premiere Pro 6 has been out for a while, and I absolutely refuse to upgrade.

82
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,520
Why? Because the sixth edition line of all of Adobe's software,

83
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,360
called Creative Suite 6, isn't actually purchasable. With CS 5.5, you buy the software

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,120
and you own it. It's yours. But you can't buy CS 6. CS 6 is offered as a monthly subscription.

85
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,040
You never buy the rights to own a copy of the software. You never have ownership of what you've

86
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,440
bought. You buy the right to use their software for a month, with a monthly fee. They're not

87
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,760
offering ownership, they're offering a service. That's why Sony can get away with taking all your

88
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,320
PS4 games, if you're banned for saying naughty words. You've never really bought the games.

89
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,840
You've bought the right to play them, a right that Sony can revoke at any time.

90
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,760
You don't actually own anything. Imagine you went to IKEA and picked up a table,

91
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,040
only you don't actually own the table. You own the right to borrow the table from IKEA to put

92
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,120
it in your kitchen and to eat off of it. But IKEA can come and take it back from you at any time,

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,200
should you do something they don't like. That sounds insane, but things are actually trending

94
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,840
that way. For example, the right to repair battle revolves around whether or not people should have

95
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,160
the right to repair or modify smartphones after they buy them. The terms of service that Apple,

96
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,960
Samsung, and others employ strictly outlines that by buying their phones, you don't have the right

97
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,120
to do certain things with them, lest you void their warranty. This goes against both American

98
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,280
and Canadian law, stating that warranties can only be voided through tampering if the company

99
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,080
provides free repairs. But so far, those laws have not been enforced. And new legislation designed to

100
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,640
allow people to tamper with their property as they see fit has been consistently lobbied against by,

101
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,400
you guessed it, Apple and Samsung. This is the first step on the road to devices as a service,

102
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,760
a phenomenon where you don't actually own that phone, tablet, or computer. You simply rent it

103
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,560
from the company for a monthly fee. You don't own that application, movie, or game. You just get

104
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,120
access to it for a monthly fee. And those who think this is a good thing offer up a convincing

105
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,640
argument. When something goes wrong, it's not your fault to fix it, as long as you haven't tampered

106
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,480
with the device, of course. For small companies renting software and hardware, they don't need

107
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,240
IT departments to constantly manage their infrastructure. Replacement is inexpensive,

108
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,240
perhaps even free. And although those are perks that ownership can't provide,

109
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,800
this is just a technological variant of the same old argument of freedom versus security.

110
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,960
Do you want the freedom to own your own stuff, with the responsibility to fix it placed on your

111
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,040
shoulders? Or do you want a company to own everything that you use, but you're off the hook

112
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,960
when things go south? Personally, I'll choose freedom every time, and I do it because I don't

113
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,400
know where this is going to stop. What if Microsoft or Google decide to take ownership

114
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,480
of the novel that you write, because you write it on Word or Google Docs? What if companies use

115
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,560
sensitive data in ways that you wouldn't want used, but you have no ownership over it so you

116
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,440
can't stop it? Oh wait, this stuff is already starting to happen. So on the one hand, you have

117
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,760
the brutalization of the monopoly, where a shitty corporation destroys all legitimate competition

118
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,840
and then turns the screws on its consumers. On the other hand, you have a gaggle of competing

119
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,800
companies who, in an attempt to get ahead, employ all manners of awful business practices. I know,

120
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm sounding like a socialist here. But you can be a capitalist and still see that this is a huge

121
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,800
problem. Property rights are the great equalizer. Companies own what they produce, and people own

122
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,640
what they buy. But companies have realized that if they stop selling what they produce,

123
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,640
and simply rent it out, then the people have no rights because they're not buying any property

124
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,880
at all. There's two solutions, as far as I can see. One is to support companies that have good

125
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,960
business practices. Steam is still pretty good, and the marketplace has rewarded them well.

126
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,040
Epic's been throwing that Chinese money around in an effort to dethrone Steam from the top spot,

127
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,400
and considering that the Epic store is implementing almost every single shitty

128
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,680
business practice I've talked about today, that's all the more reason to reject them.

129
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,000
The consumer boycott is powerful. Vote with your wallet. But the second solution comes into play

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,120
when the consumer boycott isn't working. Pirate fucking everything. And I do not say that lightly.

131
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,360
I know how much damage rampant piracy can do to an industry. I know it breaks good,

132
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,200
reasonable laws. I know it can fuck over people who are trying to make an honest living. If you

133
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,760
can support a good company offering a fair price, do it. But piracy will always be an option,

134
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,600
and it always should be an option, because we absolutely cannot let this whole

135
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,640
everything-as-a-service garbage slip by unopposed. If companies, especially monopolies,

136
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,640
will not play fair, if they continue to stand between the people and property rights,

137
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,960
then we have a duty to bleed them dry. Hey Adobe, I pirated CS6,

138
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,080
and it's still not as good as 5.5. You're a fucking joke.
