0	10140	Oh, hello. Hi. Hello, friend. How's it going? Hi. So what's what's up? What's the scoop?
10140	15100	Scoop on which? You're in Alberta, right? What's going on over in Alberta? Uh, you know,
15100	20300	it's snowing. It's about, uh, the maximum amount of news you're going to get from Alberta.
20300	23340	Actually, there's really cool research happening in Alberta, but I don't know how many people
23340	29040	will care about that. What's the research? So I don't know if people know this, but Alberta
29040	36080	and Canada in general are some of the world leaders in research on forensic studies. Um,
36080	41140	most of the, most of the most commonly used like risk assessments in forensic psychology,
41140	48320	for example, have been developed in Canada and, um, we have two unique data sets being
48320	54200	built in Canada right now that basically don't exist on in any other part of the world at
54200	59200	all. Um, which is really cool. So that's kind of the most exciting news going on for Alberta
59200	65180	is the research game in Alberta is for like child psychology and forensic psychology is
65180	69020	fucking top notch. It's really cool stuff coming out of it, which is crazy because we're
69020	73780	such a small province and everyone treats us like we're like backwater rednecks and
73780	80360	we're leading in like FASD neuroscience and, uh, this new forensic youth forensic, uh,
80360	85440	data set that we have. So, so what are the two data sets? So the first data set that
85440	89560	I think, okay, I'm biased because I'm really, I'm on both of these projects as well. So
89560	95480	I'll be clear that I'm biased, but they are really unique. This is just your stuff then
95480	101440	not my stuff at all. I'm involved in the projects, but I'm not like the lead PI, but I'm not
101440	108000	the lead PI. Like I don't want to claim extra. I I'm just like, I'm just part of the studies.
108000	112000	Like I'll be on the papers when they're released and stuff like that potentially. But the
112000	117800	first one is Alberta recently released, um, the last 50 years of assessments that's been
117800	123240	done on every single juvenile offender in our province to, uh, one of my, uh, potential
123240	130680	supervisors. Um, and the amount of data we have on these kiddos is crazy because it's
130680	136560	the last 50 years. So we have, we have 50 years of longitudinal data on some of them.
136560	140720	We have, and the level of assessment Canada does on like offenders in general, but especially
140720	144720	juvenile offenders is insane. Like we could tell you they're grade three teacher, like
144720	150220	we have everything on these kiddos. Um, which means what we can do is there's not a lot
150220	155640	of like forensic knowledge that focuses on predicting outcomes for teen offenders. And
155640	158940	there's this big question of essentially, is there prevention work being missed with
158940	164640	teen offenders? Um, and so I'm hoping I would really like to do a study that, so usually
164640	169200	in forensic psychology, what we're trying to predict is factors that contribute to recidivism.
169200	176680	So future crime. Um, but I think we should actually focus on, we should do that too,
176680	180520	but I think we should actually focus on certain protective factors. So what predicts a teen
180520	185720	completing highest levels of education, specifically completing high school, because one of the
185720	192160	best protective factors of later life success is level of education achieved. So we know
192160	195160	a lot of factors that predict whether somebody is going to do a crime again, but we don't
195160	199160	know a ton of factors about what predicts if offenders are going to complete education.
199160	202320	And if they get educated, there's a much higher chance that they're going to move out of the
202320	207320	life of like criminality and into like a more like functional element in society. So that's
207320	211700	one data set. I mean, that data set is like, that's the piece I want to study within it,
211700	217400	but you can do infinite amounts of studies with this. Like we have, it's crazy. It's
217400	221420	crazy the amount of information we have on these teens. It's going to be like the forensic
221420	227580	data on teens coming out of Alberta is going to be just infinite. It's going to be, it's
227580	233020	probably another 50 years worth of research within it. Like there's just so much data
233020	234020	there.
234020	237840	Well, well, this isn't something that I know much about, but I mean, I have heard that
237840	241860	generally when it comes to at least male offenders, the best thing to do is to wait from the age
241860	243540	out of puberty, you know?
243540	249620	Yeah, that is one thing, but there is actually benefits. And for example, you can treat them,
249620	254260	depending on what kind of psychiatric conditions are going on. The issue is treating them.
254260	260500	So the more severe psychopathology, the more severe the intervention needs to be. And it's
260500	266440	really, really hard to affect, to deliver really highly intensive and effective treatment
266440	271340	for forensic people in general, but specifically like forensic teens, just because of like
271340	275860	things like resistance. So they tend to get really resistant of like therapists. So there
275860	280580	are assigned therapy hours, but they often don't engage in them. Um, and so you can actually
280580	284780	give really good therapy. There are some predictive factors, one of the best predictive factors
284780	288700	of them not reoffending before the age of 25, because that's what we really want to
288700	293100	do is can we stop them from offending before they just like get too old and get tired of
293100	297720	it, is things like education, things like hobbies and things like support networks.
297720	303660	And so, um, that's kind of the angle I want to go with my career is figuring out how do
303660	307580	we build those things for these teens so that we're giving them hobbies, education
307580	312100	and support networks that help them move away from crime before they're 25. Because if you're
312100	316460	25 and you're finally getting out of crime, you're still really fucked for getting education.
316460	320580	Like these people are not aging out and then leading, going on to lead. Like, I'm just
320580	323740	happy Dorian, middle, middle class. Like a lot of these people are going on to like live
323740	328580	in like poverty, very low class. They often are getting like very, very bare minimum jobs
328580	333740	and they're like pretty life dissatisfied. So, um, yeah, that's one thing that we're
333740	338660	doing in Alberta. That's really cool. Right. What's number two? Number two is, uh, we're
338660	344660	currently collecting the largest data set of, uh, neuropsychiatric comparisons of FASD
344660	349280	brains to normal brains, um, in a longitudinal fashion. So we're running a study. It's been
349280	354500	running for about eight years. We're going to run it for another 10, um, basically taking
354500	361020	in kiddos with FASD and not FASD, giving them brain scans, um, in two different periods
361020	364260	and then comparing them to normal kids that are aging in the same brackets. And then doing
364260	370900	a bunch of things like IQ testing, neuropsych testing, achievement testing, um, functionality
370900	374900	testing, behavioral analysis, testing, a whole bunch of data, blah, blah, blah. Um, so that
374900	381800	we can, again, start comparing functionality and whatnot between kids with FASD and kids
381800	385880	with a normal brain, because people don't know this FASD is actually one of the most
385880	390440	common forms of like, basically like brain injury and brain impairment. It's it's more
390440	397240	people have FASD than have autism, um, which fetal alcohol syndrome. Okay. All right. Yeah.
397240	401040	So more people have fetal alcohol syndrome than have autism, which a lot of people don't
401040	407260	realize. Um, it's about 4% in Canada. So it's really, really high. We have like no data
407260	414680	on them. It's crazy. 4% of kids in Canada have fetal alcohol syndrome. Jesus. It's higher
414680	419820	in like Norway, actually. Norway is a really high amount as well. Oh, really? Hold on just
419820	425540	out of curiosity. What's Russia? I assume Russia is like, I have no idea. Uh, cause
425540	429020	the prevalence rates across countries is going to really depend on if they're testing for
429020	435100	certain things. So I watched a crowd video recently. It's about, I think it's two years
435100	440020	old now at this point, but it was basically an analysis of Russian alcoholism and how
440020	444540	it's kind of a unique situation there because it's basically become an instant, like a social
444540	449740	institution to be an alcoholic in Russia, which is a scary idea. It's very good video
449740	453620	though, but it seems like everyone over there is alcoholic. It's just part of being a Russian
453620	458340	now. Yeah. Well, I mean like vodka is a pretty like integral part of it's I think their culture,
458340	461300	not that I can like speak too much on it, but you know, I always feel like Russians
461300	467020	refer to like vodkas, like their bread and stuff like that. So, um, uh, what it is is
467020	472540	that there's something about, I mean, it's best to watch his video, hear me on it. Right.
472540	478200	I think the TLDR is there's something to do with Russian history regarding the geography
478200	482780	of the area and the invasions by the Mongols and the other social institutions that were
482780	488700	set up in Eastern Europe. Like we're talking the medieval period that basically led to
488700	494680	every Russian government, regardless of its political persuasion, um, using cheap booze
494680	500700	as the primary way to control the population. Hmm. And that's like a thousand years of alcoholism.
500700	505740	So yeah, that's really interesting. Yeah. A lot of people don't know much about fetal
505740	510860	alcohol syndrome. Uh, especially I find a lot of Americans don't I in Canada, like when
510860	516220	I grew up, I was like very abundantly aware of it. Um, yeah, same. I mean, I'm Canadian
516220	520940	too, right? I'm over. Okay. Yeah. Where's that? When I talk to a lot of, uh, Americans,
520940	523820	for example, a lot of them don't even know what the acronym stands for, which is really
523820	531140	interesting to me. Um, I should look up the prevalence rate of FASD in America. I didn't
531140	535060	know the acronym, but I do know what fetal alcohol syndrome is. Yeah. Oh, okay. That's
535060	539940	fair. That's fair. Um, but a lot of people don't realize there's a bunch of people asking
539940	543220	in chat. So I'll just explain fetal alcohol syndrome. The common effects of it is the
543220	548420	most pervasive is going to be the brain effects. So it does like massive, whole-scale brain
548420	555020	damage to infants in, in, in the womb. Um, there are some, uh, bodily stuff that can
555020	560220	occur as well. It really depends. The symptoms of FAS is going to really depend on the amount
560220	565480	of alcohol they're exposed to. And when in development in like, like neonatal development,
565480	570500	they are when they're being exposed to the alcohol. Um, so they can have physical defects
570500	574820	on their face. There's kind of like the classic, like FASD, like phenotypic expression on the
574820	578620	face with like the flattened lip, uh, eyes that are a little bit like lower set with
578620	582860	a deeper brow that are like a little bit wider apart. Um, but some kids have FASD and have
582860	587060	none of those like physical images, but if you look at their brain, they're like, you
587060	592540	can tell, like, for example, their brains tend to be like, um, the gaps between like
592540	598100	the brains have big wrinkles in them forward to the smoke and, uh, the gaps that you can
598100	603580	tell how healthy a brain is, is that the wrinkle, the, the down part of the wrinkle,
603580	606660	I'm trying to describe this without using like esoteric language, the part that like
606660	611340	folds in, it should be like, it should be a really clear line and it should be really,
611340	616100	really plump kind of like brain meat flesh around it. Whereas if you look at like people
616100	619460	with like pervasive, like holistic brain damage, you're going to start seeing these wrinkles
619460	624460	getting like bigger and wider, which is queuing that like actual brain matter between these
624460	630580	lobes in, within the wrinkles are not present because they're not occupying the space. Um,
630580	633820	you will also see less folding in FAS brains as well.
633820	637620	Does this mean that the meme about smooth brains is technically incorrect? Cause it
637620	640260	sounds like they're getting less smooth. The more damage there is.
640260	645700	Well, the smooth brains is more of like a comparative cog thing where like the less
645700	649620	folded a brain is the less wrinkles there are the less complex the brain is. Right.
649620	652740	So like our brains are kind of like our colon where they fold in on themselves so that it
652740	657260	gives maximal surface area while taking up a very small amount of volume. So the less
657260	661140	folded the brain is the less complex it is. Right. So if you look at like less intelligent
661140	664820	species, typically you're going to see less folding in the brain. It just shows that like,
664820	667620	so like that's what people mean by smooth brains. There's like less wrinkles.
667620	672380	Right. Right. So I gotta be honest. Um, well, first of all, it sounds like you're doing
672380	680100	two really cool things that are a bit out of my depth. I mean, I'm, um, my psychology
680100	686220	education education comes from taking abnormal, uh, intro to psych and abnormal psych in university.
686220	690860	Okay. Nice. The only, the only reason I did that is because the professor was like, listen,
690860	694580	if you're not getting a psych degree, at least go to abnormal psych. That's where all the
694580	698220	fun stuff is. Yeah. I'm normal psych is really fun. It's where you get to diagnose all your
698220	704820	friends. But that was, that was still almost 15 years ago at this point. Okay. Yeah. I've
704820	708660	been like, I've been watching you and I've been watching Aidan Paladin and I've been
708660	713180	watching like some other psych people online. So I don't have any formal education in this
713180	716820	stuff. Okay. Well, you gotta be careful of psych people online, including myself. I very
716820	722900	much say like in psychology, there is absolutely a hierarchy of expertise and the greatest
722900	729180	number one thing on that hierarchy is having a data, having data behind your words. Um,
729180	735460	right. There's a, there's a lot of pop psych that is very bad and full of misinformation.
735460	738780	And I've been seeing more and more like tick talkers and different like psychologists starting
738780	744740	to like jump in social media and just like debunk really bad pop psych because it's like,
744740	750180	it's crazy how much like bad information there is on psychology. It's wild. It's when you
750180	755680	can like go to some kind of strange places on the internet and see people using evolutionary
755680	761060	psychology to talk about like why some races are inferior and stuff like that's that junk.
761660	766180	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. To be fair, there's always, there's always been like,
766180	773100	um, a, a scientism streak, I think in psychology, even since like, I, Oh God,
773100	777380	I don't recall who it was that said this, but there was an American psychologist,
777380	782220	or actually this would have been pre psychology, but it still would have, hold on. What, what year
782220	786380	we were talking about the slavery era. And I think psychology hadn't been formalized at that
786380	793700	point. Uh, psychology like really formalized with William Vunt in like 1890. So, okay,
793700	798580	this would be a bit before that, but basically there was a guy who decided to say that slaves
798580	806020	who wanted to be free had some sort of a, of a psych related mental problem. And he, he wrote,
806020	810340	uh, this, this would have been like the w what was it? Early 18 hundreds. Um, he,
810340	815060	he wrote some sort of literature that was all complete nonsense, but it was basically just
815060	822900	justifying the current political situation using, using mental health. I feel like there's,
822900	829460	there's probably, um, maybe, maybe not a tradition, but at least like a strain of psych
829460	833020	that probably has some bad actors doing that all throughout its history. For sure. I mean,
833020	837440	if you go to any field of science, especially any science that can be like mapped onto human,
837440	842020	like human expression existence, there's absolutely bad actors who have tried to like
842020	846620	weaponize science for like bad means. Um, and I would, so like you see the most of it in like
846620	851980	biology and psychology, um, not as much in sociology, but that's also because it's like
851980	857260	not a super strong science, um, in comparison, not that I'm saying like psychology is a hard
857260	861620	science by any means. Um, there's just like some level of like empirical rigor that's applied to
861620	865980	it. Um, but yeah, absolutely. There are bad actors and we have to be careful, right? Like that,
865980	870460	this is why people are afraid of IQ is because IQ was weaponized in a really, really bad way.
870460	875460	The issue is like, we don't need to solve that problem by dismissing IQ tests. What we need to
875460	882380	do is like prove why, for example, if they're like prove, prove why basically racist can be racist,
882380	886060	but that doesn't mean that like they can weaponize science. So like explaining things like, you know,
886060	894280	um, IQ isn't the same thing as moral value at all. Weird concept, you know, which our society still
894280	899300	struggles with. I mean, I, I started my pro my platform by talking about IQ tests and then I
899300	903740	realized it seems like nobody can engage with IQ tests like, well, because it's really hard to
903740	909500	like disentangle IQ from like moral value for a lot of people. Right. If I say like somebody,
909660	914500	if I say like somebody is less at sale, like, yeah, my one friend has like a lower IQ. Um, what
914500	919700	they hear is my friend is worse. And it's like, well, that's not necessarily true. Like say I have
919700	924020	a friend who does have a lower IQ, which I've never talked about my friend's IQ. They might be
924020	928420	super gifted in a million other areas. Like IQ is predictive of certain things and success in
928420	932180	certain areas and in areas that our society values. But I would argue, like, isn't it a
932180	938660	problem that we don't value other things that are predicted for outside of IQ? Um, but like being,
938940	945020	yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, there's, uh, there's, I think there's just a natural tendency
945020	951260	to have a chuckle at someone who like, okay, I'll just use an example. Okay. So, so Zander Hall, you
951260	951900	know who Zander Hall is?
952460	956620	Uh, yes. I've seen a bit of his content, not a ton, but yeah, I know he is.
956620	962860	He, he did an IQ test on, on a stream and he got like a 93 or something, which is below.
962860	967260	Okay. Well, any tests that you do that you could just do on your screen is garbage just as a heads
967260	972060	up, but also if he got 93, that is surprising because these things always inflate you by like
974460	979180	well, he got a 93 and then he turned around and said that, well, IQ isn't real anyway. And it's
979180	983980	all just, it's all just a tool of capitalism to try and keep working people down to create a class,
983980	988300	a class structure. And I was like, this just sounds like coping at this point. And it was just,
988300	992140	it was funny. And it's kind of cruel because, you know, we're laughing at a guy because of
992140	996460	intelligence, but there's also still like some, some short and fried there, especially since he's
996460	1003260	been not very nice to me over the four years. I can have a laugh and understand that it's also
1003260	1010540	probably a little bit cruel too. Yeah. Um, it can be cruel and like our societies really do like
1010540	1017740	Mo most infrastructure in our society absolutely abuses IQ. Um, and like how,
1017740	1023580	like I'm actually extremely quiet for your audience. Oh, really? Oh, bumpy guys. Even
1023580	1028380	more. Can you hear me? No, I'll bump you up even more. You're at 148. I'll bump you up to 200.
1028380	1031180	Oh, well, sorry. Hold on. I can, maybe I can do something on my end. Just me.
1032220	1036060	If you like. Yeah, no, no, please. If they can't hear you, then this is a one-sided conversation.
1036060	1039740	And then everyone's I saw a couple of like, this is awkward. And I feel like maybe that's,
1039740	1045020	that's why they were saying this. Can you imagine that it's just you talking to yourself actually,
1045020	1048940	and they couldn't hear me at all. That would be kind of awkward. I'm not going to lie. So
1048940	1054220	you're way louder for me, but I'm checking your decibels on my thing and it's not higher,
1054220	1059660	but everything on my site is maxed. I gave it a short nudge on my audio interface here.
1060220	1067980	I can give it another short nudge. Well, I'll watch the chat just in case they, um,
1067980	1073180	your voice is a little distorted now. So it's, it hasn't bumped up in volume. It's just kind of
1073180	1076540	distorted your voice. Like it's like peaking really hard now. So you can probably drop it
1076540	1079900	down. You're staying at the same decibel now. So you can probably drop it down a little bit.
1079900	1082140	It sounds like people are saying it's okay. Um,
1084460	1089820	yeah. Okay. Here's, I'll turn down the game, but I'll turn up the level. I think. Okay.
1090460	1090960	Okay.
1094140	1098620	Because game like affects the sound that your mic takes in and level just
1098620	1101580	takes that sound afterwards and then boosts it.
1102540	1108140	Um, thank you cowboy Christ for letting people know about FAS. It is called both technically
1108140	1115980	FAS is fetal syndrome, but yeah, you sound good. Let's do a couple more tests.
1115980	1121020	Test, test, test. Hello. Yeah. You're pretty good. You're a little peaky still,
1121020	1127180	but it's okay. It's not the end of the world or clipping or something. I'm clipping. All right.
1129820	1133660	No Dev that he's dummy thick. Yeah. I know. I mean, fat's in the name, right?
1136220	1141900	Yeah. Isn't it? I love when you get insults about things that you're like, I like, I don't know how
1141980	1145820	often to get insults like that, but I'll often get insults. It'll be like using the not so like,
1145820	1151340	they'll be like, not so smart indeed. And I'm like, good one. Like it's kind of implied with
1151340	1159100	the name, but go for it. King go off. So I guess the, the quick TLDR and who I am for your audience
1159100	1162620	since, I mean, we just talked for like five minutes, but I might as well act like we just
1162620	1174300	started. Yeah. So I started in 2009 on YouTube and wow. The, the name short fat otaku was because
1174300	1180300	it was me and my friends. And we were younger goofing around with a camera making like channel
1180300	1184940	awesome style, anime videos, rather than cause channel awesome had people doing games and people
1184940	1189420	doing movies, but not really that many anime people. And I liked anime and my friends like
1189420	1194620	anime. So we're going to do an anime show and we did that for a bit and we had like a few viral
1194620	1201660	hits, but in 2009, you're not really making a living on you. This is pre-patron. So, but you
1201660	1204940	know, we got like, you know, the first video we put up got like a quarter of a million views,
1204940	1208380	which is a lot back then. And it was like, oh shit, maybe we can actually make this work.
1209180	1214380	But there was no money in it. And also copyright strikes back then were just your video got
1214380	1221180	deleted. There was no appeals process. Oh, wow. It was. Yeah. So it was hard to actually kind of
1221740	1225660	keep the momentum going on the channel. Yeah. And also like we were going off to university
1225660	1232540	and we kind of had things to do that were, you know, real life things. And we tried to do like,
1232540	1236940	let's place and we did less plays a couple of years and those were actually more successful.
1236940	1240860	I turned those into a side channel where I do like gaming content on the side and I still get like
1240860	1245020	100 viewers whenever I stream over there, like 50 to 100. It's pretty good. It's a nice little
1245020	1252140	side hustle. But gamergate came along in 2014. And I was like, maybe I should, you know, toss my hand
1252140	1257500	into the online politics ring. And I did that. And that's when the channel really started growing.
1258140	1265900	And so, you know, I did some videos that had some traction. I got a shout out from Sargon in like
1265900	1271820	2018. And that gave me like 40,000 subs. And I got to a point where I could I could like quit
1271820	1275660	my job. And so I was like, maybe I should know to talk time. And I've been doing that for maybe
1275660	1282700	a year and a half now. Wow. That's crazy. Yeah. Living the dream. At least for me, it's it's my
1282700	1289100	dream. So like, so you're full time full time now, like you're able to basically afford life.
1289820	1297980	I'm full time. And I also have employees who really made it. Yeah. One full time editor. And
1297980	1305020	then my girlfriend also pitches in. She's she's part time, though. Okay. The goal is to eventually
1305020	1310460	like, hire all my friends and just spend our days having fun. Hmm. So that's the goal.
1311500	1315260	I'm so curious now that you've been because you've been in the space way longer than me. And I know
1315260	1319020	kind of obviously I'm stealing this directly from Devin Nash. But I always hear that there's
1319020	1324300	kind of two major like forms of monetization that you can pursue as a content creator,
1324300	1329180	which is maximize views, maximize numbers of like subscribers and everything and assume that
1329740	1333340	a very small percentage of them will give money and they'll give a very small amount of money.
1333340	1339980	Or maximize like a niche have a lot less people. But those people give a lot more money in total
1339980	1344060	because they like really value the niche content that essentially that you're providing. Do you
1344140	1345740	think that you're catering to one or the other?
1348140	1353580	I don't know. I haven't thought about it like that. I've, I have always treated my channel as
1354380	1360860	a personal project that I never expect to make any money on. I just so happen to. So that's why
1360860	1363820	there will always be like, sometimes there'll be a conflict. It's like, listen, this is the
1363820	1367020	video that I feel like making today. This is the stream that I feel like doing today.
1367020	1370300	And some people are like, well, that's not what I wanted to see today. Well, it's like, okay,
1370300	1374620	well, you can come, you can come by tomorrow then. But like, I've always kind of put my own
1375260	1380220	interests first and the audience second, as selfish as that kind of sounds.
1380220	1384300	Because I realized that like, if I faked it, it just wouldn't be very good. You know, if I,
1384300	1388460	if I talked about a topic that I don't really care about, but it's the big thing right now,
1388460	1391500	I think it would just, it would, it would be shallow and it would be,
1393100	1397100	I wouldn't care. And it would, it would, people could tell the audience could tell that I didn't
1397100	1400860	care. And it would just, you do that too much and you lose everything because then it's like,
1400860	1406540	oh, this guy's just solid, you know? So I don't really look at my numbers that much.
1407580	1411900	I don't look at my like, oh, did this video do better or worse? You know, I don't really watch
1411900	1416540	that too hard. It's probably, it's actually probably to my detriment that I'm not data driven
1416540	1422460	on, on YouTube, but I feel like I might end up destroying myself if I try to.
1423180	1429740	Yeah, I mean, I try to never look at numbers at all. I like, let my editor do that almost
1429740	1436700	exclusively. Because it's just like, yeah, it's just not a, not a good situation if I do. I'll
1436700	1443580	get obsessive for sure. Yeah, I can definitely, you know, I do like, at my size, you have to at
1443580	1449500	least sometimes. But I can tell whenever I go into the analytics panel, I can like, feel the itch
1449500	1453260	in the back of my brain. And it's like, okay, I can't spend more than a few minutes here just
1453260	1455900	to do what I need to do. And then I need to get out of here. I can't just watch these numbers for
1455900	1461100	like the next six hours. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, I agree. You just get in your head. And like,
1461100	1464780	the problem is that yeah, if you're making content that you feel like obliged to make,
1464780	1468860	I feel like the content quality necessarily goes down, which like hurts the wallet,
1468860	1472060	but also is like kind of disappointing your viewers, which is like, why you're kind of
1472060	1475580	doing this. And there's like this very weird inverse relationship that you can have with it.
1476380	1481820	Mm hmm. So Artemis Fowl is somebody who watches me quite a bit. He just sent you a $5. He said,
1481820	1485340	This is money I would give to SFO, but he's Canadian. Erudite's Canadian.
1485340	1490060	Yeah, that's true. It's still going up north, man, no matter what you do.
1491020	1498300	That fucked up. Oh, no. This is money I would give to SFO, but he's a Canadian.
1498300	1501660	He's a nice guy. He's a bit autistic. I've talked to him a few times. He's kind of nuts.
1501660	1503980	He's been on my stream a few times. And I always
1503980	1508300	an autistic person online. That's crazy. There's no neurodivergent people online.
1509020	1516780	I've hosted Artemis Fowl, who's very libertarian versus Econoboi on economics. And that was a shit
1516780	1521820	show of a stream. Was it? My God, it was fun. It was really fun. Because like, they both seem
1521820	1527900	to be pretty educated and pretty intelligent people. But they, they hard disagree. And it
1527900	1531260	was like, Oh, okay. And then I'm just kind of sitting there watching sound really know too
1531260	1535660	much. I got a little bit of economics. I took intro, but like, my university career, by the
1535660	1540940	way, is like intro in every single field. Did you get a degree? Did you ever get a degree or
1540940	1545180	I did? Yeah. But I took like, I took seven years to get a four year degree.
1545180	1549580	Oh, wow. So what what is your degree in English literature?
1551980	1556780	Wait, you generalized on everything. And then you settled on English lit. How the fuck? I feel like
1556780	1560860	that is not not the direction I would expect. Why did you settle on English lit?
1563340	1568780	Um, cuz I liked it. You know, yeah, a lot. Yeah, like, it's the same as my YouTube channel,
1568780	1574460	I found that like, okay, so, you know, I miss people going to university. And I understand
1574460	1578540	why people don't do this, because university has just become like the bare minimum for most jobs.
1578540	1583260	But I wish we had a university system where people just went into things because they wanted to
1583260	1591020	think Artemis and they wanted to be researchers. Thank you for making fun of Artemis publicly and
1591020	1596380	loudly. Appreciate that. He is also one of my guys, too. I did I did an ad everyone on my
1596380	1601420	Discord to annoy everyone to get them all. Oh, wow. I was telling my chat that you and I've been
1601420	1608620	like, DM friends for quite a while. I know, but we've never chatted publicly. It's crazy.
1608620	1614940	So I so I started watching you because of destiny, which is probably a story you've heard a lot.
1614940	1618940	What? You found me the destiny? No way. Oh, my gosh. Hashtag orbiter life.
1621420	1627020	Um, I'm in DGG chat a fair amount. He gave me a shiny checkmark covering capacity. It was actually
1627020	1632860	me chat. And I don't I don't pop out. I don't I don't have a discord permissions to actually
1632860	1637900	jump on the streams at all. But I watch. And, you know, it's been pretty interesting conversations
1637900	1642220	until like the current orbiter arc that just seems to be pure fucking cancer right now.
1642220	1645820	So I'm not watching right now. But I've watched a fair amount now for about a year.
1648140	1654460	So I was like, Oh, great, erudite. She seems really cool and interesting. I'm gonna go check
1654460	1659660	out her stream since since destiny is not online right now. And I go over to your stream. And
1659660	1665580	you're watching one of my videos. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then you're like, now, guys, this is not a very
1665580	1669740	good video. But there's at least a nugget of truth in here that we should probably consider. And I
1669740	1678620	was like, Oh, okay. I don't know what that means. I was amazing. What video was that? I was calm,
1678620	1685580	reasonable and centrist in my opinion. It might have changed a few views since then. It was old.
1685580	1691340	Thank you. Artemis again. Artemis is shit talking him. Of course he is. Yeah, I was amazing on the
1691340	1697020	election and I was calm reasonable centrist in my opinions economy. That's fair to kind of boy.
1697020	1702940	Um, I was a nice guy. I disagree with him a lot. But he's a really nice guy. I've enjoyed talking
1702940	1706620	I've talked to like four times now. He's great. Yeah, he's got a pretty big brain,
1706620	1709340	a pretty big brain for economics. And I've learned a lot from him.
1710220	1715420	See, if I go to your page, I wonder if it'll just like, I'll be able to see like, which one is got
1715420	1719820	a view bar on it. I talked about Mass Effect in it. It was like a video game oriented.
1720060	1726060	It was like, it was something like, the right in the 90s was censorious, and the left was free
1726060	1730700	speech. And now things have switched around on the on its head. It was a video kind of about that.
1730700	1734780	Because I talked about like, Jack Thompson, if you know who he is, he was like a politician in
1734780	1741340	the US who wanted to get video games banned. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I talked about like the
1741340	1747980	the Mass Effect controversy where in 2007, Mass Effect comes out and you can play as a human lady
1748860	1753820	and have a lesbian sex scene with a with a blue alien lady and you can see like a blue bum
1753820	1759820	for a few seconds in the game. And so Fox News back in 2007 stirred up this big controversy
1759820	1764700	about it and how it was it was the degeneracy that was destroying the youth of today was in video
1764700	1773020	games. I love blue bums. Yeah, did you play Mass Effect? Are you a gamer at all? Ah, I play games.
1773020	1778700	I don't know if anyone would honor me with the title of gamer by any means. Okay. Yeah.
1778700	1785740	Well, it actually came out because they did a remaster of the Mass Effect trilogy last winter,
1785740	1791100	I think. And it came out in the hype to the release of that, that because of the Fox News
1791100	1796620	backlash towards the lesbian sex and Mass Effect one, they took a character in Mass Effect two,
1796620	1801260	who was very clearly a lesbian or at least bisexual, a very butch character.
1802140	1806140	And they had recorded voice lines with the actors for a lesbian romance option and,
1806140	1810620	and they took it out. They took it out. And they had no gay sex in Mass Effect two because they
1810620	1817980	didn't want any backlash from Fox News again. Damn. Well, damn outshot by the by the Christians
1817980	1823180	back when Christians used to be the ones who are censoring people. Yeah, the old religious guard
1823180	1828300	and now we have a new religious guard. So yeah, the video is something about house like the
1828300	1833260	censorious nature of politics has inverted that I think about that. And you had some kind of
1833260	1837180	problem with it. But I remember the problem. I can't remember at this point. I can't remember
1837180	1841580	either. It was like six months ago. I'm sure I felt very strongly though. And I hated you in that
1841580	1848780	moment. Oh, yeah, yeah. But that was that was like a 2019 video, I think. And I might have changed,
1848780	1852860	I might have been softened on opinions or change things since since then. But I mean, I still think
1852860	1857820	that the general thesis is the same, that I think the left right now is pretty censorious. And it's
1857900	1863020	probably not good for us. Because I'm, I'm in my 30s. At this point, I remember an era when the
1863020	1866940	left wasn't that. And that's why I called myself a leftist. And now I don't call myself a leftist
1866940	1868540	because I don't like where things are going.
1869900	1873660	Yeah, plus the left is kind of hate you. Although the right hates you too. So
1875180	1881340	yeah, oh, yeah. Both of them hate me. It's great. So I've, you know, Vashj has called me a fascist
1881340	1887180	at least once on the stream. And I do know, the serfs have done the same, you know, Lance over
1887740	1891260	pretty much all the bread tubers. I don't come up often, so I'm not that big of a figure. But
1891260	1894460	when I do come up, it's like, Oh, he's that fascist guy. And it's like, Oh, all right.
1894460	1895340	Where's the right call you?
1896620	1901820	Communist. Okay, because I'm, for me, I'm just like, Hey, you know, I don't mind a universal
1901820	1905340	health care service in the government. It's probably a decent use of tax dollars, guys.
1905340	1910540	And they're like, Oh, so you're a redistributive commie cuck, who wants the state to just give you
1910540	1919260	handouts? It's like, All right, guys. All right. However, I was just gonna ask, what do you think
1919260	1923980	is your least popular take with the left? Where do you think we would most disagree?
1925260	1926780	You and I will do you consider yourself a leftist?
1927660	1929100	No, I've never been a leftist.
1929900	1930400	No.
1930700	1935020	I mean, I thought I was a leftist when I was in normie land. Because I'm quite progressive.
1935020	1940860	But then I realized that on the internet, I'm at minimum, I'm probably a moderate progressive.
1941820	1945980	Yeah. Yeah. So I've heard a lot of people say you're a liberal, not a leftist, right? When
1945980	1951420	you talk about like, people who aren't socialists. Yes, like, fair enough. Yeah. And if that's the
1951420	1955420	definition, fine, I don't have any emotional attachment to the label of left, I will take
1955420	1959180	the centrist position. I'm okay with that, you know. As for what you and I disagree with, I'm
1959180	1962700	not sure. Um, I've watched a fair amount. I think I've watched more of yourself than you've watched
1962700	1969980	mine at this point. So I'm not sure. Yeah, I'm a bad consumer of content. I need to do it more.
1969980	1973980	I get stressed, though. I don't I get stressed watching other people's content. Because every
1973980	1977260	time I watch somebody's content, I'll be like, man, they do this really well. And then I'm like,
1977260	1979260	oh, fuck, I'm not doing that. I need to be doing this.
1980300	1985100	Oh, I feel the exact same way with everyone that I watch. Oh, oh.
1985100	1989500	So it's a problem. I literally like some people's streams. I can't like watch sometimes because I
1989740	1996860	whole time, I'm just stressing about like, where they excel, which is the most self focused thing
1996860	2001260	you could ever do of being like, I know, I'm trying to watch my friend make content here.
2001260	2008140	But gosh, I feel insecure. Like it's so late. It makes me so bad. But I'm always doing this balance
2008140	2011100	of like, yeah, but I also need to be like, mentally healthy. And I have a lot of work
2011100	2014300	to do as well. So like, how do I how do I juggle all these fish? I don't know.
2014540	2018860	I know what I did, because I feel the exact same way. I got to a point where I'm just like, okay,
2018860	2021900	so what can I learn from this, and I become more analytical. And now it's like, okay,
2021900	2026460	I've, I've taken enough criticism over the years that now I'm just in the pure, like,
2026460	2029500	okay, how do I improve mode, you know, I'll watch something, I'll be like, oh, I should do this.
2030140	2032380	I don't like, I don't beat myself up nearly as much.
2032380	2037020	Okay, I'll do it found you through destiny a while back. Subscribing.
2037020	2041420	I think you are more interesting than destiny in many ways. Much love.
2044300	2053340	Oh, okay. So you also, however, watched my three forms of fascism video.
2053340	2056460	That was my most recent magnum opus. That's been like a year in the making.
2057020	2060380	Yes. And you got in a lot of trouble for that. I heard.
2060380	2061180	Wait, did I?
2061180	2064220	I thought you said that the right came out and just was fucking were we talking about
2064220	2065020	how they were attacking you?
2066140	2072620	I actually forgot that it happened so often. I have like a new because Okay, so for example,
2072620	2077340	since that video came out, let me just quickly see because it's been a little bit. I did.
2079420	2086220	I'm in my back end right now. Where's that video? Okay, so since then, I did my our trans woman
2086220	2093420	actually woman video. And my answer to that was like, mostly no. However, I did leave like the
2093420	2098540	door open for like a tiny yes at the end. And that got a lot of right wing people kind of angry.
2098540	2103820	Um, I did. I did a video on where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
2107020	2110620	I did a video on the mega republicans. You know how Biden did that speech,
2110620	2114620	like two months ago, where he was like, the mega republicans, they want to overthrow democracy.
2114620	2116380	Yeah. And the right got really good.
2116380	2119900	And he had like the red background and people like clicked it. So he looked like an evil
2119900	2120780	Sith overlord.
2121420	2125900	Yeah, yeah. So the right got like highly offended at that. And I was like, I'm going to examine this
2125900	2130300	and actually look into it. Yeah. And what I found is that, you know, from an outsider's point of
2130300	2135260	view, he didn't say anything too bad. However, if you filter, if you like, put yourself in the
2135260	2143740	shoes of a rightoid, and try to examine it from there, from what I don't, there's probably a
2143740	2151660	worldview. No, no, no, no. It's worldview, but it's more than that. It's that a, when you hold
2151660	2157100	the belief, it never feels like a belief. It just feels like the way the world is. Does that make
2157100	2158460	sense? Yes.
2159660	2165500	So if you were to say, hey, you know, rightoids have this belief, but to them, it doesn't feel
2165500	2171340	like a belief. It feels like reality. So you have to like, really say, okay, what they believe is
2171340	2175660	the truth. And so and so they kind of reorient your brain for a few minutes and be like, okay,
2175660	2181500	so the right wingers actually think the election was rigged and stolen from them. And that January
2182380	2186780	6th was a populist uprising against a corrupt government, desperately trying to take back
2186780	2191900	democracy, and it failed and it was put down. Okay, so put yourself in that headspace. And
2192460	2195980	now listen to what Biden's saying. And it sounds extremely scary.
2199820	2205100	Now, I don't agree with them, by the way, just so we're clear here that I'm not, I don't believe
2205100	2209340	that the election was stolen in 2020. I'm not one of those guys. But I've talked to a lot of
2209340	2214700	people who believe that. And I've, I've tried to like, understand their point of view, try to make
2214700	2223100	them understand my point of view. And a lot of them are extremely frightened. So when I made
2223100	2229580	that video I went through, I'd saved up since 2017, a series of events where left wing people
2229580	2234620	had been physically attacking right wing people, just for wearing a mega hat. And I had like half
2234620	2239100	a dozen of them, where you see people coming up to like one guy, I know Stardust watched this video
2239100	2244620	on her stream. And she, she was surprised at how much of this violence was going unreported in the
2244620	2249340	mainstream media. One guy in New York, he's an Asian guy who he owned an art gallery in New York,
2249340	2253340	he had a mega hat on just walking around town. And a crowd of people came up and just beat the
2253340	2257180	shit out of him. He had a broken eye socket, his eye was like all red and bloodied, and his face
2257180	2261500	was swollen up to like double the size of what it normally is, it was pretty, it was a pretty brutal
2261500	2267500	attack. And you, on right wing media, you see this all the time, right? If you go over to parlor or
2267500	2273180	getter or whatever, you're gonna see another leftoid has attacked a mega patriot. And you're
2273180	2277420	gonna see a picture of like a guy who's like, like all bruised and bloodied up. And these are
2277420	2282060	real attacks. Like, you know, a week before the election, the midterm election, a Republican
2282060	2286300	candidate got his house shot up. And no one mainstream you talked about that, like that,
2286300	2290220	that went completely under the radar. But this guy had his family at home. And, you know,
2290220	2295260	the FBI investigated it was it was some deranged leftoid went did a drive by on his house. No one
2295260	2299420	said a thing about it. Oh, this is the problem with this. This type of criminal type of
2299420	2305260	conversation is right on one side, we're only hearing air at night. Do you believe that
2305260	2313820	conservatives view the repeal of Roe v. Wade as progressive? I see what I see when the left is
2313820	2319100	victims too. Yeah, I was gonna say is interesting, right? Is that the conservatives will look at
2319100	2322220	this and be like, See, look at all these crazy things happening. And I'm like, Okay, but if I
2322220	2327740	just literally I just googled transgender woman attacked. And I can also find just like stories
2327740	2332860	from like, a month ago, three days ago, two months ago, two days ago. Yes. Right. And so it's like,
2332860	2338700	the issue is like, all sorts of crime is going on all the time, all the time. And just to be clear,
2338700	2343260	it's all bad. I grabs back a fucking obviously. And the problem is that if you have a worldview,
2343260	2348460	that's only talking about one of them, then you like because both sides feel afraid. I think
2348460	2354620	that's the issue. And the issue is I sympathize. I think both sides. I think this is a criticism I
2354620	2360220	would give of like the center is there is cause for concern. There is cause for concern. We are
2360220	2365900	attacking both of these groups. There is increasing in like violence and division. And like, the
2365900	2370140	institutions are really, really fucked. Like both sides are now concerned about the institution
2370140	2374860	integrity. And I think that there's good reason for this, right? I'm like, there's all of this.
2374860	2378620	And I think we have to be really careful in the center to not like do the both sides would be
2378620	2382700	like, but both sides have validity. It's like one of them probably has they might have equal
2382700	2386380	validity. One side might have more validity. It's really, really, really fucking hard to tell. This
2386380	2393020	is where we need like science and data. But yes, yeah, they're both afraid. And I think both sides
2393020	2398140	should be a little bit afraid. I can understand why they would be on both ends. Yeah. So so what
2398140	2402380	you said is completely correct. But if you were to go up to that guy who had like a broken eye
2402380	2406460	socket and a swelled up face and told him that it wouldn't be very convincing to him, you know,
2406460	2410220	he'd be like, I just got the shit kicked out of me simply for being a republican. What are you
2410220	2418860	talking about? And that's not an unreasonable reaction to have. So like, I watch people who
2418860	2422620	are much further left than me. And I watch people who are much further right than me, you know, I'll
2422620	2426140	watch some bread tubers that don't really like, you know, I'll watch there's there's some really
2426140	2430220	crazy people on the right that I don't really, really like, but I'll, I'll check out everything,
2430220	2436140	you know, and I see. So I made a video. And this video was basically, um, here's a collection
2436860	2441820	of things that I know the left has ignored, where right wing people have been legitimate victims of
2441820	2448300	crime. And I know and I know you guys know this. So we're coming into 2020. You the right has four
2448300	2453100	years of feeling like the victim and feeling like no one's listening to them whenever it whenever
2453100	2457980	they get attacked, whenever they get shot up whenever something happens. And now we're asking
2457980	2462780	them to accept Oh, by the way, you actually did lose the election. That's even though it's true.
2463340	2468860	It's a really hard pill to swallow. You know, when you have four years of victimizing these people
2468860	2473580	and then ignoring them, and then turning around and saying, Oh, yeah, even though the media
2473580	2478460	ignored all this shit for four years. Now you got to believe us when we say that you actually
2478460	2482620	aren't the victim this time. Like good luck getting to believe that. You know what I mean?
2483500	2490620	Yeah. Yeah. And the issue is, it's really hard. It's really hard, because
2492540	2495500	I, this is where I struggle with the conservatives, right? This is why like,
2495500	2501180	I don't think I'd ever fall into the conservatives is, I think, at an anecdotal level, I understand
2501180	2512540	them. All of the data I find, makes me hesitant. But then I take into mind, I'm like, I know that
2512540	2516220	they don't trust the institutions. I know the institutions are left leaning and stuff like
2516220	2521740	that. Not that I think the FBI is, but it's like, I understand at an anecdotal level, why people on
2521740	2527420	both sides are afraid. The issue is that it doesn't mean that equivalency is actually occurring here.
2528380	2530620	Keep up the good work. Fire.
2530620	2536620	Fuck, figuring out if it is an equivalency, or if there actually is one side that has a much
2536620	2541900	more legitimate claim to concern is really, is really fucking hard to tease apart. Because like,
2541900	2546220	for example, like I can get stats on like, increases on like crime, like there's pretty
2546220	2550540	clear stats on the increase of anti trans crime, but by the FBI, right, that's pretty clear.
2550540	2556300	If I look up like MAGA hat crime, I don't find anything, but I don't know if the FBI is even
2556300	2560780	categorizing those types of assaults as MAGA hat related assaults, like I don't know.
2562060	2565180	Like, I'll have to keep looking. But it's like, how are these things being like anti trans
2565180	2569420	categorization makes sense? What would they be categorizing as like an assault based on like,
2569420	2573260	being conservative? Are they even tracking that as like a politically based assault? Or are they
2573260	2577180	just counting that as an assault? Or they're counting it as a racial, like poverty? Like,
2577180	2581820	how is this getting categorized? And so like, a lot of these things are like super hard,
2581820	2587020	but I think like a very legitimate criticism of the sense of the moderate is that they just want
2587020	2592140	to fence it and say both sides are equal. And it's like, sometimes they're not. Sometimes there is a
2592140	2597900	there is a worst case. And it's really important. I would argue for everyone to figure out which it
2597900	2604220	is. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely agree. As somebody who does a lot of fence sitting myself, I
2604220	2608700	definitely agree. The issue is like, I'll talk to the right, and they'll say the same thing,
2608700	2612460	but for their side, right? They'll be like, Dev, you got to get off the fence. You're clearly
2612460	2615740	clearly the left's evil. And they're coming after us, man. And I'm like, well, I don't know about
2615740	2618540	that, you know, and then I'll hear people on the left say the same thing. And I'm like, well,
2618540	2623500	sometimes I don't know about that either. Or I do know, or like, I'll hear like, they're like,
2623500	2627420	but they're D platforming conservatives. I'm like, that's fucking true. And then like, but like,
2627420	2632380	anti trans, like sentiment is on the rise. And I'm like, that's fucking true. Like, both of
2632380	2637180	these things are true, right? And like, I get somebody was like, Okay, well, is D platforming
2637180	2641980	the same thing as being anti trans. And it's like, they're obviously not the same construct.
2641980	2647020	The issue is we have to analyze like impact. And that's really fucking hard to do. Because the
2647020	2651340	anti trans stuff feels at face validity as having the more impact like that feels self evident.
2651340	2656140	However, like D platforming has major major consequences that we're really only starting
2656140	2660860	to see that are not as self evident or like intuitive. So yeah.
2660860	2668300	Yeah. And then like, I don't know if there's a formal name for this fallacy. I've just been
2668300	2672140	taking I've been taking to calling it the spotlight effect. Where you look at like
2672140	2677180	libs of tik tok, for example, right? Yeah. And libs of tik tok might show you a video.
2677740	2683980	And that video is going to be of a person who is trans or genderqueer or something who is actually
2683980	2687580	acting quite poorly. And they should maybe they shouldn't have their job in the school where
2687820	2693020	they're talking about doing these weird things. But then you scroll through libs of tik tok and
2693020	2697500	you see another one of those videos. And you might see five of those videos. And so now and
2697500	2701500	let's just assume just for the sake of the argument that these are five cases of people
2701500	2706460	who probably should be fired for what they're doing. Then you're gonna think this is walking
2706460	2713020	everywhere. This is every teacher now in 2018. Congress asked FBI if they are trapped in the
2713020	2721020	violence. And the FBI said no, then FBI claims what are the most dangerous democracy like
2721020	2727740	a huge systemic problem with every single school in the United States. Yeah. So I don't know. I
2727740	2730700	just call it the spotlight effects that kind of intuitive that makes sense. I don't know what we
2730700	2735980	should call that sampling bias. Something availability confirmation bias, motivated thinking,
2735980	2742620	kind of all these. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And then I've also seen like, an equivalent account called
2742620	2748620	chuds of tik tok from the left. And the and they're like, they're posting tik toks of these
2748620	2753180	rednecks, we're talking about how they want to overthrow the government and how democracy isn't
2753180	2755820	legitimate anymore. And it's like, well, look at these people. It's like, yeah, but these are still
2755820	2759980	just five rednecks, you know, it's what it's, yeah, it's why we need to like, we need to figure
2759980	2765340	out as a society how to think well. And we tried critical thinking. And that has been fucking
2765340	2771900	garbage. Critical thinking, like, education doesn't work at all. It's basically just like,
2771900	2782220	it feels nice. Yeah, we just need a society that thinks well, like an amazing, amazing researcher
2782220	2787020	who like talks about this type of shit, who's talked to like, people that probably we wouldn't
2787020	2791180	usually respect, like Jonathan Haidt and like other researchers is Julia Galef. Like she talks
2791180	2797420	her entire works, life's work is literally talking about how to think well, because like, these are
2798060	2802300	heavily complicated, highly politicized. So it's like, even if I say, let's get the data.
2802300	2806140	Okay, well, what if the institutions aren't working very well? Well, they're slow as well.
2806140	2810940	What if there's a bias within the institution, for example, like sometimes the FBI does tend
2810940	2814220	to overflow certain things and call like things like terrorism, when it's like, maybe it's
2814220	2819020	terrorism, maybe it's not. But also, like, we have academic institutions who are maybe like dismissive
2819020	2824380	sometimes of like conservative talking points. And so it's like, trust, like we want to use the data,
2824380	2828940	but interpretation of data can be corrupted by like human political bias. This is like why
2828940	2832060	when you try to look at like trans athletes, when you try to look at the literature and
2832060	2837820	trans athletes, it is like so complicated to actually work through, which is why I love
2837820	2841900	talking with Jangles, right? Because he's somebody who's really dominant on the left side of
2841900	2845260	understanding this. And it was a really, I don't know if you ever saw our conversation. It was like
2845260	2849740	one of the best conversations that I think I've ever had in this space. It was a debate.
2849740	2853100	I actually don't watch any Jangles. And I don't think he likes me very much.
2853660	2855660	Oh, that's too bad. He's...
2855660	2860540	I don't know why. Maybe I trolled him on Twitter once and he, like, I don't, it was,
2860540	2861580	I don't know. But...
2862220	2867740	That's fair. But he was, he was insanely good faith, right? And we basically came to the
2867740	2875740	space of being like, look, the literature on trans athletes is pathetic. There's not a lot.
2875740	2879900	We don't really know fully what's going on. There's a lot of theoretical speculation.
2879900	2885180	And there's some data that is starting to fall in a certain direction. The problem is that on
2885180	2890540	both sides of the spectrum, most of the data is being interpreted by heavily biased researchers.
2890540	2895100	It's incredibly difficult to find a researcher who's just going into this and in a much more
2895100	2902140	open way, just trying to explore and see what the data actually says. There's one now, there's one
2902140	2905900	lead. I can't remember her name. That's she's doing some really, really interesting. She's
2905980	2909980	coming out with a meta analysis in 2024. And I'm really excited for, but it's like,
2909980	2915820	even in preparing for my trans athlete debates, I went through basically every single study released
2915820	2920540	on trans athletes that I could possibly find. And I've never seen anybody cite a study outside of
2920540	2926140	the list that I look through. And it was like, alarming how little we know, like nobody even
2926140	2930780	controlled for body fat percentage. I think there's one study now that's come out very recently that
2930780	2934620	finally controlled for body fat percentage, when this is like the most obvious thing that you
2934620	2939260	should be controlling for. Like my husband thought of that based erudite. It's crazy.
2939260	2942460	And so it's like, when we're talking about these things, both sides want to see like,
2942460	2947180	it's so fucking obvious. And I'm like, you don't know the first thing about data analysis,
2947180	2952700	if you think that this is fucking obvious, especially complex shit, like political crime,
2952700	2957580	terrorism type shit. It's not fucking obvious. And so it's like, you don't want to be a fence
2957580	2960220	sitter who does like the false equivalency and be like, Yeah, but both sides are being
2960220	2964700	mean to go babies, right? What you want to do is being like, what if both sides have legitimate
2964700	2969340	claim, but they're very different claims that require different responses, and also are one
2969340	2973900	of these sides posing greater threat to the other is one side more inclined towards violence,
2973900	2979180	things like that, right? Thanks for the service. Sorry. And the raid. Thank you so much for the
2979180	2984460	raid. There was like, yeah, you got like 20 gifted memberships there. It's a big bundle.
2985020	2990860	Congrats. Thanks, guys. I had see I think it was actually today I saw a Reddit post of somebody
2990860	2996300	who's just like, Listen, it's from a left wing point of view. Listen, the data doesn't matter.
2996860	3002300	And self ID is more important for political reasons. So ignore all that shit. And if someone
3002300	3005980	identifies, you should just let them play in the sport of their choice. And it's like, well,
3006700	3011900	no, sorry about that. But I'm not gonna agree with that at all. What is your I haven't watched any of
3011900	3015900	your transports debates. I watched like, actually, you know what, I think I watched one with destiny
3015900	3020060	where it was with jangles. In fact, I guess the only jangles video I've seen in like the past year.
3020060	3025020	Yeah, yeah. So what is your take on the whole thing anyway? Well, we mutually came to actually
3025020	3028780	good conclusion debate was the most productive shit I've ever come because we came up with a
3028780	3033260	number of prescriptions that seems to do the best at balancing certain things because my orientation
3033260	3040540	is sports is vital for people's well being and functioning. There is one group Hold on, I gotta
3040540	3044700	sorry. Thank you so much, Anthony Rojas. I gotta skip this alert because I am getting so distracted.
3047660	3053580	But thank you so much, Anthony. I really, really appreciate it. So here's what we see in the data
3053580	3060780	is it's really important to get teens connected to sports. Sports is one of the most supportive
3060780	3066460	community based well being promoting protective factors that we can give teams that tends to be
3066460	3070860	affordable and accessible. Pretty much across the board, there is still a bit of a financial
3070860	3074940	gatekeep. But depending on the sport, a lot of those gatekeeps can be somewhat overcome, because
3074940	3079420	it'll be like 20 to $30. Whereas like hockey would be something like 600. Right? So you got things
3079420	3084620	like soccer and track, which are going to be really, really important sports to try to get your
3084620	3089900	lower income individuals, right? So I would, my whole goal in the trans athlete conversation is
3089900	3094380	saying, how do we get trans athletes competing and ensuring that we're maintaining sport fairness,
3094380	3099260	because sport fairness is not like a simple thing. Sport fairness is a very scientifically
3099260	3105260	defined construct that is heavily researched, dominantly because of the Paralympics, actually,
3105260	3109340	this is where a lot of the sports fairness research really butted out of was looking at
3109340	3114700	people with certain amputations. So I think one of the most famous cases that people talk about
3114700	3119180	is there was a guy who had a leg amputated and had one, actually, I think both of his legs were
3119180	3124700	amputated from from, I think, just above the knee. And he had two prosthetic legs that were
3124700	3128460	somewhat springy. And what they did when they found out when they researched him is that he
3128460	3135980	couldn't engage with basically like, bio legged people like people who were not amputees because
3135980	3141180	he actually had a fair play advantage because his springs gave a certain increase of force
3141180	3145420	per muscle mass because of the density and the flexibility of the metal springs, right?
3145420	3151660	Something that is fucking complex, by the way, like not self evident. It, you know, it's,
3151660	3158860	it's complicated. So yeah, anyone who was a kid in the 90s, who watched who watched or played
3158860	3162460	video games or shows where you had like a character with robot legs can see that coming
3162460	3166540	from a mile away. I guarantee you because it's the first thing I thought of. I don't even know
3166540	3171180	the story. The first thing I thought of was he's gonna have bionic legs, he's gonna be able to jump
3171180	3177900	like way higher. Yeah. So what we found with trans athletes right now is this,
3177900	3185020	we do know that it seems that certain advantages are maintained, even after so I would recommend
3185020	3190620	basically always making sure that you have had HRT for about a year, ideally, the actual amount
3190620	3197900	should be two years, we see that hemoglobin levels, red blood cells, and just testosterone as well,
3198460	3203980	tend to be mostly regulated and balanced by that time. The recommendation for T levels is still
3203980	3209740	under five milligrams per like deciliter. That's pretty standard, because most women are between
3209740	3216380	like two to four, and it can be really dangerous and difficult. So that's, that's kind of where
3216380	3221340	most people end. What I suggested to jangles is that that isn't sufficient because it seems to be
3221340	3226700	the case that most trans athletes maintain strength benefits. It's not super clear why
3227420	3233900	my, so my theory based on not just me, obviously, based on what I've read, theoretically speculative,
3233900	3238220	is that the reason that they maintain some of this is because, so a lot of people don't know this,
3238220	3242860	a muscle cell is multi-nucleic. So you can have multiple nucleuses within a single cell. So muscle
3242860	3247820	cells are massive, right? You can have a cell, a single cell spanning the entire length of your
3247820	3252860	bicep because there's multiple nucleuses along it. You can also have them be wider than regular
3252860	3258060	cells, because again, you can add nucleuses to maintain the function across greater volume and
3258060	3265180	space. So these little nucleuses, my own nucleic cells, when you build them up, so say I get a
3265180	3269100	really big pump, right? I get really strong. And then I maybe get like a major back injury. What
3269100	3273900	we discover is that if I stopped training, say for a year, my muscles deplete, they atrophy,
3273900	3279260	I'm very skinny and small, no muscles, no gains, but go back to the gym. The first little while at
3279260	3284940	the gym, I'm going to see explosive growth up until basically just a little bit below where
3284940	3290940	I was before. The reason why we see that is because of the nuclei. They never go away.
3290940	3297580	So like for really simply, if I have six extra nucleuses in my motor, in my muscle cell,
3297580	3305420	those things never disappear ever, ever, ever. And that means that your cap for actual cross-sectional
3305420	3309900	space in your muscle is higher because you already made those nucleuses. Whereas the
3309900	3314540	process of adding new nucleuses in just takes a really long time and a lot of really rigorous
3314540	3319500	training. So that's my theory. And I didn't get into this, but I also suspect that they have
3319500	3326140	greater like motor neuronal. So motor neurons in your body need space. And so the bigger
3326140	3330780	cross-sectional space and muscle is the more space there is for motor neuron, like the really small
3330780	3337100	ones to develop and exist within there. And so you can have two people with similar bicep size,
3337100	3341180	and one of them has developed more motor neurons in that space because they've just done a lot
3341180	3345980	more specific type of training who can be way, way stronger. But if you've already had a lot
3345980	3350780	more cross-sectional space, those motor neurons don't really disappear either. So these are two
3350780	3357500	things that even after HRT, even after all these things, these two things maintain from what we see
3358060	3361900	permanently or permanently for at least an athlete's career. It might be possible that
3361900	3365820	like, because cells die and renew every like seven years or so. So it's possible that these
3365820	3371420	things will go away after like a certain number of years, but most athletes careers like five to
3371420	3375100	six years max, right? And they're really peaking. Their peak performances are going to be within
3375100	3381820	like three to four years for most explosive sports. So how do we accommodate this? Well,
3382460	3386700	one of the best things we can do is control for the amount of muscle mass that's being
3386700	3391420	available to a person's body. Women have to maintain a higher body fat percentage,
3391420	3395820	their organs shut down. If they get below a certain percent, men can go significantly lower.
3395820	3400780	Typically women need to stay above 12 to 13%, again, depending on genetics. Whereas typically
3400780	3405260	men, some men can go as low as four before their organs start showing up. That's really low. Most
3405260	3413420	men can get to five or 6% and maintain. So that means there is a 6% gap of weight on your body
3413420	3418460	that can be fat or muscle. And so if you're doing explosive sports, you want as much of
3418460	3424700	your body weight devoted to muscle and not fat because muscle generates the force. Fat is inertia,
3424700	3430220	right? Except for in swimming where fat is buoyancy as well. So what I suggested is
3430220	3437100	essentially having like a minimum body fat requirement for specifically at least trans
3437100	3442060	women. And my goal is to also let trans men compete because here's the thing, if trans women
3442060	3447020	maintain an advantage, that means trans men maintain a disadvantage as well, potentially.
3447020	3452300	And so we actually need to accommodate both athletes. So Jangles and I both kind of came
3452300	3457020	to this together, but suggested basically having a body fat minimum, especially for weight category
3457020	3461100	sports. So it's not a solution to team sports, and it's not a solution to all like track sports,
3461100	3465580	but it is a solution to like, actually, most sports in the Olympics are there's a ton of
3465580	3470700	weight categorized sports, like most fighting sports and stuff like that. So that is one
3470700	3475020	solution that I can come up with. But this is based on very paucity of literature. And it's
3475020	3479260	like, and that's just my fucking idea and Jangles idea. Okay. Somebody else who's much smarter than
3479260	3482140	me and much more trained in the space probably can come up with a better idea.
3483020	3489340	Right. So as somebody who's a layman on this, I'm learning stuff, so I enjoy it. As somebody
3489340	3495740	who's a layman on this, I did my own layman video looking at some data as I understood it as a
3495740	3501820	layman, making sure to tell my audience always that, hey, I'm an English literature guy. I don't
3501820	3507100	have the prerequisite background to really understand this stuff. But here's what things
3507100	3515900	look like to me. And the layman's conclusion that I came to is if you start on HRT when puberty
3515900	3520140	starts, you're probably fine to compete with cis women. Otherwise, you're probably not fine
3520140	3525420	to compete with cis women. If we're talking at like the the the extremely high end of competitive
3525420	3531100	sports, like Olympic level sports, you know. But I mean, if we have no data, we have no data to
3531100	3536860	suggest that one way or the other. That's literally speculative. So possible. It sounds good. I just
3536860	3542460	you know, it sounds good. No idea if that's true. Yeah. Right. However, because you're more educated
3542460	3547100	on this stuff than me. I wanted to talk about the fascism. Maybe we'll come back to the fascism
3547100	3551820	video after this, but I want to throw something at you that I don't understand, but I think you'll
3551820	3559740	understand, OK? Because you have a big brain for psych, it sounds like. I try to. Yeah.
3561100	3567180	So I know a trans person from Scotland named Chloe who's involved in the do it yourself HRT
3567180	3571580	scene. It's not Bob posting different Chloe, somebody who's completely unknown to your side
3571580	3579740	of the Internet. And I went to them and asked them, hey, how does how does how do puberty
3579740	3586060	blockers work? Because she was under the opinion that puberty blockers without HRT accompanying
3586060	3592060	them is bad. And I was like, well, tell me, tell me about it, Chloe, what's your opinion?
3592060	3597580	And she drew me this diagram and tried to explain it to me, but I did I don't I kind of get it,
3597580	3600620	but I think I need somebody who's smarter than me on this stuff.
3601180	3605180	OK, can I show you the diagrams? Sure. You want me to pull it up in chat?
3605980	3610940	Sure. Well, are you going to show your screen? You know, I'll just post the links to you. Let's
3610940	3615420	see if this works. So here's a diagram. Can you can you chat? See that? Or can you see that?
3615420	3621580	I'm going to pull it up like in two seconds. So she painted this. All right. OK, beautiful.
3622140	3628460	Paint for me. She's very wrong, but that's OK. Yes. She's Scottish. I don't blame her.
3630460	3635020	But she had good ideas and spell incorrectly. OK, let's just be super clear about that.
3635020	3639020	She also I think she also spelled receptor wrong. Isn't it a C? Not an S.
3640540	3647500	It is a C. But yeah. So she said that this was basically the the hormonal cycle of what
3647500	3653020	hormones trigger what glands in a in a normal cis person. OK. Does that sound about does this look
3653020	3658460	right? I am I am actually not very well versed in endocrinology, specifically like hormonal
3658460	3668060	endocrinology. Oh, no. So I'm not really sure. I I'm not really sure. And it is gonadotropin
3668060	3676700	is my understanding. My sex hormone receptor. Yeah, I cannot confirm nor deny somebody more
3676700	3679660	true. You know, who would be good to answer? This is probably somebody like Corey Campbell.
3679660	3683420	He'd be probably more likely to answer this than me. I have no idea who that is.
3685180	3690380	I don't know. He's a he's a biologist who streams. OK. All right. Well, anyway,
3691340	3695740	maybe we can just kind of look at it then, I guess. But the way she described it to me
3695740	3701740	is you have the pituitary gram, which produces gonadotropin. The gonadotropin tells the sex organ.
3701740	3708060	There's a gonadotropin. OK. All right. Well, it tells the sex organ to make
3708620	3716060	your primary sex hormone. And then the the presence of the primary sex hormone
3716060	3722220	tells the hypothalamus to tell the pituitary gland to stop making the gonadotropin.
3723740	3728940	And so there's like two there's two chemicals at play here where one turns the other one off,
3728940	3734620	basically. And this is how she described it to me. And then for all gonadotropins.
3736220	3741340	I'm not sure. I don't know. She said this was a layman's understanding for a layman like me.
3742780	3749260	Then she sent me this second diagram here, and this was what blockers do.
3751100	3754460	And so the blocker takes the place of the gonadotropin, which means that
3755260	3762540	now your body isn't isn't making any like the pituitary gland thinks that there's gonadotropin
3762540	3767100	around, so it's not making any more. But then your sex organ doesn't see any gonadotropin,
3767100	3772700	so it doesn't make any primary sex hormone. OK, because that makes the GNRH analog. Yeah,
3772700	3776540	it looks like I'm finding a similar type of like it's a simplified.
3777740	3782620	OK. Yeah. You just posted to me something that looks very similar. Yeah. Just not made an MS paint.
3785340	3790780	So she said that this is this is what happens when you go on blockers. And the fact that you
3790780	3796620	have no primary sex hormone when you're only on blockers, that's that causes what all the
3796620	3800620	problems that we hear about people going on. It's like bone density problems and stuff
3800620	3806700	that causes those problems. So her solution, she sent me this third diagram. Here's the
3806700	3816780	third diagram. And so her solution is that. You need to have some kind of sex hormone
3816780	3821180	in your system if you're going to go on blockers, you can't just go on blockers
3821820	3825580	because it's the presence of a sex hormone, whether it's the one associated with your
3825580	3832540	birth sex or the other one that basically allows that prevents the problems from happening,
3832540	3838780	basically. OK, and I was like, well, I don't understand any of this, but you would probably
3838780	3845100	need both of them available, right, because men and women both have. Estrogen and testosterone
3845100	3848060	and stuff like that, because they're all needed for different developmental things. Yeah,
3848700	3853500	but if if you're not producing any from your sex from your sex organ because of the blockers,
3853500	3859980	and that seems like that would probably be a problem. And so this was her logic. And I mean,
3859980	3863100	she's more educated on this than me, but I also don't completely understand it. So
3864300	3868700	unfortunately, I can't comment. I mean, honestly, like this is this is the reality of where the
3868700	3873580	literature is at. We don't understand endocrinology super, super well. Like, obviously, I'm a layman
3873580	3878300	on it. But my understanding when I talk to people who study in the field of endocrinology is that
3878300	3884060	it's like it's a budding field. It's just like most medical shit. There's a lot we know. There's
3884060	3891740	even more that we don't know. Right. And I'm open to any solution that works empirically, because I
3891740	3896300	want trans athletes to compete. I want trans people to transition. I want them to have provided
3896300	3900460	medical care. That is not a problem for me at all. So I'm open to all this, I would just say,
3901100	3905980	just test it, make sure it does work. Make sure it is tanning out. Because I don't know enough
3905980	3910380	about endocrinology to comment on this one way or the other other than saying, sounds cool,
3910380	3914140	makes sense. I don't know enough to criticize it if it didn't make sense.
3916140	3920860	That's where I am, too. But you should definitely test it. Like if this if this would offset a
3920860	3925660	number of the problems with like puberty blockers in like, youth and stuff and like offset some of
3925660	3930140	the like negative effects like bodily that they have based I mean, that would be good. Let's
3930140	3933580	not have people being harmed by their medical transition as much as possible. That would be
3933660	3934780	something I'm obviously for. So
3935820	3941420	well, um, she does some some DIY HRT out of Scotland. And it's the main reason that she
3941420	3947100	won't give anyone blockers without HRT. She's like, No, you have to take them both. And that's
3947100	3952620	kind of her her policy for the stuff that she does. Oh, this Chloe, the one who used to run
3952620	3958060	the DIY directory? No, no, no, no, no, no different Chloe. That's not it's not sorry.
3958860	3963420	Okay. No, completely different Chloe. I'm not I'm not going down a couple's rabbit hole right now.
3963420	3968300	No. Um, there's there's a it also like I've actually made the joke with her a few times
3968300	3972700	like, you know, your your DIY HRT involved in your name's Chloe. And she's like, Yeah, I know.
3972700	3980940	I know I did. But it's a different person. She does a different organization. But she she won't
3980940	3986460	give she won't give anybody just blockers because she believes that it's actually quite harmful to
3986460	3991420	people to go on just blockers. Right. And I just wanted to show you what she had shown me because
3991420	3995420	I don't fully understand it. But oh, well, it was interesting to think about anyway.
3997820	4000700	That is interesting to think about. I unfortunately have no
4000700	4002540	intelligent commentary to make on it. So
4003420	4011660	Oh, well. Um, so to roll back, if you don't mind, okay. Rewind a little bit. You said you had
4011660	4016060	watched my three forms of fascism video. And yes, it did actually gotten get me in trouble with
4016620	4020620	with some people who are, let's say, on the dissident, right? They don't call themselves
4020620	4025420	alt right. They call themselves dissident, right? Um, because they thought that I was singling them
4025420	4029980	out with my third form. The problem with that is that I wasn't really giving my own opinion. I was
4029980	4033180	summarizing the books that I had read. Right. What do you think the video?
4035980	4039580	Um, I thought it was I thought it was good. It was interesting. I think you outlined some
4039580	4044060	interesting positions. I watched it quite a while ago. Now I feel like I should have prepped it and
4044060	4047580	watched it so that I could have given you more specific feedback because it's been a while and
4047580	4051900	I didn't take notes on it. And if I don't take notes on something, I, I don't remember it very
4051900	4056540	well. Fair enough. Um, but yeah, it was really interesting. Um, I thought you like handled it
4056540	4060060	really carefully. Oh, I feel bad because this is your like magnum openness. Opus. This is important.
4062460	4067820	Yeah, this is this was a big one. So basically, um, do I have an active Twitter? Uh,
4067820	4070940	I'm currently banned off Twitter. I can't be there. But if you want,
4070940	4077500	you can follow an account called Morbius Devo. It's not a bad account. Um, but okay, so
4079820	4089740	wonder how detailed. Okay, so at a podcast co host for for a few years, we were pretty good friends.
4090540	4096940	Um, however, the TLDR is it basically he, he had stabbed me in the back. And that was kind of the
4096940	4102860	end of that friendship in the end of that podcast. And it was fundamentally over political
4102860	4107660	differences because he had radicalized over the course of lockdowns. He was treated very badly
4107660	4114300	by his government, because he had he had he had a job that brought him a lot of money, and had him
4114300	4120300	traveling a lot. And suddenly he was locked in his house by government for like over a year. He
4120380	4128460	didn't take it very well. So he radicalized. And he was he had like, he had a bunch of very
4128460	4135260	esoteric dissident right literature in his house. He had two trans women who were who were very far
4135260	4140220	right themselves and more than happy to educate him. And he had a giant pile of cocaine. Okay,
4140220	4144700	he was stuck in this house for a year. And he completely morphed into a person that I just
4144700	4149420	didn't want to associate with anymore. Not even because of the politics. I can I can be friends
4149420	4154620	with almost anyone, regardless of politics, but in terms of his personality, his his behaviors,
4154620	4160460	the way he would treat people, I was like, I don't think I want to be. And then of course, he he had
4160460	4166300	backstabbed me and he had backstabbed Sargon and like our entire friend group. So he was just
4166300	4170700	kicked out of our like, we have like a discovery, hang out, we removed him from actually couldn't
4170700	4173500	trust him anymore. We didn't want no one wanted to talk to him anymore. It was like, okay,
4173500	4180700	we're kind of set. We're kind of burning this bridge here. Um, but afterward, I kind of
4180700	4188140	thought I don't understand what happened to him enough. So I started reading the books on his
4188140	4194540	reading list. And there were some fascist writers in there. And there were some socialist writers in
4194540	4199820	there. There were some libertarians and anarcho capitalists. Basically, his his reading list was
4199820	4205500	like a hodgepodge of everyone who is not the current establishment. I was like, I want to
4205500	4213020	understand this. So I did I spent like a year reading stuff. And then I compiled all of that
4213020	4217260	down into what's, you know, a 20 minute video and put out the three forms of fascism.
4219900	4227260	And the TLDR of it is that the first form is Mussolini's classical fascism,
4227260	4234940	where he Yes, yes, yes. I'm remembering this now. Remembering. So from that, that comes out of
4234940	4241420	the socialism of George Sorel, who was a French socialist. Yeah. And basically, in like the was
4241420	4247980	1890s, maybe there was a big debate among various socialists and communists. And the debate was,
4247980	4254140	why was Marx wrong about the impending socialist revolution? If you read Marx's political theory,
4254140	4261260	there's a lot in there about about, there's a predictive, almost prophetic element to his
4261260	4269660	theory. He says, Listen, that that the the movement from feudalism to capitalism was natural
4269660	4275500	and inevitable, as the forces of history converge, and it was going to happen no matter what. And so
4275500	4279820	he said, the same thing will happen with the socialist revolution. Eventually, the capitalist
4279820	4285420	mode of production will be brought to its maximum capacity, inequality will ramp up to it to its
4285420	4291260	breaking point. And there will just naturally be a revolution, we will have the dictatorship of the
4291260	4298220	proletariat. And then as the society educates itself to be more socialist oriented, the state
4298220	4303340	will fall away on its own. And then you will have your your stateless moneyless classless society.
4303340	4307980	This is a natural to Marx, this was a natural occurrence, it was just going to happen.
4308460	4315820	Without any sort of outside intervention. And Marx predicted that there was going to be a huge war
4315820	4320540	that was coming up in Europe, that would kickstart the whole thing. That was World War One, and it
4320540	4326380	didn't happen. And so from the 1890s, there's actually a previous war, I think was it was it
4326380	4331100	was the Boer War? They also said it might be, I don't remember exactly that. Basically, there's
4331100	4336860	a period of about 30 years in there, where socialists were writing, hey, why, why was Marx
4337740	4341420	wrong about this predictive element of his theory? Where did Marx go wrong? And there was two schools
4341420	4346780	that came out of that. And the first one was Antonio Gramsci in Italy. And he was a member
4346780	4352780	of the Communist Party of Italy. He was eventually purged by Mussolini, and he died in prison. But he
4352780	4357660	wrote the prison notebooks. And the prison notebooks are just a collection of writings
4357660	4363500	that were smuggled out of the prison that he was in. And he wrote about how the reason Marx was
4363500	4371340	wrong. The reason Marx was wrong was that the values that we all share, the moral values,
4371340	4378540	the religious values, these were actually tools of the bourgeois to make the proletariat become
4378540	4384140	invested in bourgeois culture. So for example, the reason that you shouldn't steal is not because
4384140	4391660	stealing is immoral, but because the priest class of your society is indoctrinating you to not to
4391660	4400380	not steal from the bourgeois class. And so all of morality is simply a tool used by elites to
4400380	4407820	prevent the socialist revolution. And Gramsci's prescription to solve this problem was to
4407820	4414620	infiltrate cultural institutions, to infiltrate religious institutions, to infiltrate academic
4414620	4420140	institutions. And once you've taken up positions of power in these institutions, you start to
4420140	4425180	make them more political. You say, Oh, well, every you know, you see here on the progressive
4425180	4430300	side a lot, everything's political. So we will, we will what we'll do is, there's the liberal idea
4430300	4435260	of a neutral space where we can objectively examine things doesn't exist, the liberals are
4435260	4441180	wrong. Everything's political, everything has some sort of a political bent. So we have a moral
4441180	4445980	obligation to make sure that it's our political bent, and not anyone else's that is privileged
4445980	4451900	in any institution. And the people who the the Gramsci people ended up becoming like
4451900	4455100	the Frankfurt School people. And that's where you get like a lot of critical theory stuff
4455100	4459420	that you see the critical race theory and stuff that the right is kind of correct about,
4459420	4462300	but they don't know why they're correct about it, because they haven't read Gramsci.
4463420	4467580	That was one school of thought. And so you have Gramsci, which then splits off into
4467580	4472460	modern progressivism. The second school of thought was George Sorel. George Sorel believed
4473340	4480620	that the reason that Marx was wrong, was that democracy itself castrated the revolution.
4481420	4486300	Because if you're engaging in a parliamentary democratic system, you are making concessions,
4486300	4491020	you're making deals with these other non socialist groups that do not want a socialist revolution.
4491020	4496700	And basically, they will co-opt you and they will turn you into just an element of the bourgeois
4496700	4504060	that has no revolutionary potential. So for Sorel, the idea was, reject democracy,
4504060	4512140	reject compromise, and be violent, violence, violence for violence's sake. Because if you
4512140	4517180	if you wait for a moral reason to be violent, like a revolutionary reason, you're just going
4517180	4525420	to be co-opted. You must value violence a priori. That this is okay, so far.
4525980	4533100	Okay, so from George Sorel, that's where you get Mussolini, because Mussolini spent most of his
4533100	4538380	life as a Sorelian socialist. And then he developed fascism, basically, the classical
4538380	4546780	fascism basically, as the Sorelian socialism kind of come to its full potential. And he had
4547740	4551900	his, you know, working in a Hegelian sense, he had this idea that the state was supposed to be
4551900	4556460	this ultimate arbiter of all that is good and moral in society. And so everything should be
4556460	4561340	brought into the state. And then he had the corporate economy, the corporate economy,
4561340	4565420	economy was like a series of councils that controlled from the top down all of society's
4565420	4571260	production for the good of the state. And classical fascism, as a political theory,
4571820	4577900	is pretty close to socialism. And a lot of people on the left don't like to hear that,
4577900	4583020	even though it is the truth. What in that it's like, in what way specifically?
4588780	4594460	Basically, that, at least from their point of view, it was because if you're going to be a
4594460	4602220	socialist who rejects democracy, in the way that George Sorel prescribed, the fascist state was
4602220	4606940	kind of the natural end result of that. And that's how they viewed, they viewed themselves
4606940	4614860	as the inheritor of the socialist project. So the Mussolini fascists basically like
4614860	4621820	utilized and weaponized the socialist eradication of democracy, because they realized that in that
4621820	4625900	eradication, the process by which it's done necessarily leads to a fascist state?
4626940	4631900	It's something like that. Yeah. It's also that, um, another another difference was that when,
4631900	4638780	when Marx was talking about revolting against the bourgeois, the bourgeois was like a nationalist
4638780	4642300	oriented force, you had like landowners, and you had people in the government and stuff.
4642860	4648220	But by the time the 1890s came around in the 1910s, capitalism had become more globalized.
4648220	4653660	And if you were fighting the bourgeois at that point, you were fighting almost like a landless
4653660	4659420	internationalist movement that had that viewed nations as a, an impediment to their goals,
4659420	4664460	because they, you know, neolibs want free trade, they want to, they view the borders between
4664460	4671180	nations as things that are hurting their business interests. So it turns out that the the Mussolini
4671820	4675580	fascists, they looked at socialism and said, well, if we're going to implement any sort of
4675580	4681020	workers revolution against the capitalist system, it has to be a nationalist revolution.
4681980	4687980	It has to be a revolution from the right. Because, because the the interconnectedness
4687980	4693740	that kind of comes along with, with the left's broader ideology has led to the problem of
4693740	4699500	globalist capitalism. Um, and then you have then after that, you have neo fascists, which is which
4699500	4705420	are just Hitler, and Hitler kind of took that, and really, one, he racialized it, because he noticed,
4705420	4713180	at least in Germany, that there was a slightly disproportionate amount of Jews working in banking
4713180	4718220	and stuff. And there's reasons for that, that aren't conspiracy. I'm not a conspiracy theorist
4718220	4721820	here. Like, the reason for that is because in the in the days of the Holy Roman Empire,
4721820	4728060	there was a religious, there was a religious persecution of people who handled money,
4728060	4731340	the Christians couldn't do it, but the Jews could, because they had different religions.
4731900	4736060	And so basically, you had a lot of Christian lords saying, hey, I can't actually do anything
4736060	4740060	with banking, but can you do it for me? And the Jews said, of course, we'll just take a cut.
4740060	4743820	And then they became like banking families, right? And same thing happened in the Ottoman
4743820	4748700	Empire. So there was there's a completely reasonable reason as to why this is happening,
4748700	4756940	that it isn't, you know, the Jews secretly control everything. All right. But basically,
4756940	4763980	what ends up happening is, Hitler took this conception of capitalism as being a globalist
4763980	4769660	problem, and said, hey, the Jews don't have a nation. Like the Germans have a nation,
4769660	4776060	the Italians have a nation. The Jews don't have land. They are a class of people that floats
4776060	4782940	throughout Europe, without a homeland. And does that not make them at least kind of representative
4782940	4790940	of of the the global capitalism that is currently controlling the German working class? So he
4790940	4799260	racialized this idea, and he kind of pushed it to its extreme. And those were those two movements.
4800620	4803980	Someone in the chat says the dude's running a fanfiction. No, no, no, I'm quoting political
4803980	4807420	theory here. I don't agree with any of this. I want to be clear, like I'm not I don't agree
4807420	4812220	with it. So this is it sounds insane. We're still saying so we've transferred from Sorel,
4812220	4817900	who basically argued that in the process of a socialist movement, movement overtaking and
4817900	4823340	destroying democracy, it would inevitably become fascism because violence is presumed,
4823900	4830220	essentially, for the takeover. I'm not I'm still not really seeing Sorel's link of socialism.
4831260	4835820	The violence is necessary. And because violence is necessary, he essentially equates violence with
4835820	4841660	a fascistic state. And that's why a socialist overthrow will lead to a fascistic state.
4842300	4845820	I'm just trying to understand Sorel because that that gap isn't quite making sense. I would
4845820	4851100	understand a socialist overtake would lead to a socialist state authoritarian state.
4851100	4857260	So so the violence is part of it. The other part of it was that the the fascists basically believed
4857260	4862940	that to revolt against the capitalist system, it has to be a nationalist revolt against an
4862940	4869820	international capitalism. So it had to be like a nation coming together as a people and uniting
4869820	4874860	and throwing off because it's national. Okay, so the nationalistic nature of the overthrowing.
4875660	4881420	Yes. So part of the reason that the Italians believe this is because they had just fought
4881420	4885260	a war of reunification, right? They had been a bunch of city states that were decentralized
4885260	4889900	in the end, the Austrian Empire owned some other land. And they said, No, we want we want a United
4889900	4892940	Italy. And so they had like three wars over over trying to unite Italy.
4893660	4900540	Is there any? Is there any socialist revolts that we see that follows what Sorel predicted? Like
4900540	4905980	we're because I think we're political theorists get their like meat tested as if their political
4905980	4911020	theories seem predictive of like multiple, multiple instances of this incurring in later
4911020	4917020	history. Right? I would say the Soviets. I think that's why after the Second World War,
4919100	4923500	after the First World War, Sorel ended up throwing his lot in with the Soviet Union.
4923500	4927580	He was an old man at that point. Was that a democratic? I didn't believe Russia was
4927580	4932620	democratic before I thought it was a form of like, monarchy or something. I thought it was
4932620	4938460	much more of like, I, I didn't believe it'd be a democratic state. They they tried to do like,
4938460	4943580	uh, a Western European style parliamentary democracy that pretty much instantly fell apart.
4944460	4951260	Um, but yeah, like there was like, there was the czar, the czar. Thank you. Yeah. So it was a
4951260	4956540	monarchy. So it's, this is where Sorel's thing breaks down is he said that a democratic revolution
4956540	4961180	overtake that socialist in nature would lead to fascism, but then the only evidence, how come
4961180	4964620	you're stating the evidence as, and I know this isn't your position. I'm just trying to, I'm,
4964620	4971260	I'm grilling you as, as the, as the one with more information, why would the evidence of Sorel's
4971260	4976540	predictive power of his theory be Soviet Union, where it was a monarchy state and the Nash,
4976540	4981340	was it even a, so was it even a socialist movement specifically? Because, oh, are you,
4981340	4986300	and are you saying Soviet Union is fascistic, not communist and they're not at all.
4986300	4992140	So what's communist? Is anyone communist? Um, well, per Marx, this is why they always
4992140	4996540	say it wasn't real socialism, right? Because per Marx, it wasn't. Marx said that communism was
4996540	5002140	a stateless moneyless classless society and the Soviet Union wasn't any of those.
5003660	5011260	So, but, but basically the, the Soviets had a lot in common with the fascists when you actually
5011260	5014940	look at their political institutions and a lot of their rhetoric, a lot of their propaganda,
5014940	5018860	the way that they kind of organized things in their society, they were a lot more fascistic
5018860	5023420	than anyone likes to. And, and, and, and people on the left, like on the online left, like the
5023420	5027740	modern day left, they will say like, they call them red fascists because they were like fascists
5027740	5032460	with, with, uh, with leftists, uh, leftist. Um, and you agree with this assertion? Like,
5032460	5039340	would you agree that, cause I feel like no one except coping communists say that it was fascistic
5039340	5043980	unless basically we're saying that like communism and fascism are kind of like, this is the issue
5043980	5047740	is fascism is an undefined construct in everything that I can like, look into like,
5047740	5052700	nobody agrees. What is fascism? This is why when you say is the GOP becoming fascistic,
5052700	5056780	there's arguments to make for and against it, depending on whose definition of fascism you're
5056780	5061500	using and what tenants of fascism you're using as well. Right. Like with like masculinity and like
5061500	5067660	stuff like this. And so like, I could see elements of it within the Soviet Union. However, I feel
5067660	5073980	like everyone dominantly would agree because these like, like when we talk about communism,
5073980	5077020	right, the class is going to be like, okay, well, what kind of mark, what kind of comments are you?
5077020	5081660	Are you Marxist? Are you Leninist? Are you Maoist? Or are you Stalinist? Right? Like these things
5081660	5086380	are all lumped together. And so I feel like if we say that they're fascistic and not communistic,
5087260	5091260	then essentially, are you saying like the communists are right. There's never been a true
5091260	5096300	communist state, which maybe is true. Maybe the reality is that communist state just cannot get
5096300	5104620	up and kicking. But that seems to fly in the face of like, communism seems much more defined
5104620	5107500	than fascism. So I can understand why you would label that. But I wouldn't be comfortable saying
5107500	5111420	that it wasn't communist as well, because it has so many obvious structures of communism,
5111420	5116780	like government overtaking private businesses, and redistributing land and wealth and like resources
5116780	5121660	as they see fit and redistributing people as they see fit. There's like minimal privatization and
5121660	5125980	dominantly, like huge bureaucratic government bloat, dictating everything and fucking everything
5125980	5130620	over. To be fair, that is what the classical fascist did too. They did all those things as well.
5132540	5136460	So but I thought I thought one of the there's a lot. I thought there was private businesses that
5136460	5140060	were allowed. It's just like Hitler, for example, would go to a private business and be like, okay,
5140060	5143580	you can stay private, you can still run it, but you have to make this thing. Like that was my
5143580	5148860	understanding of how he was versus like Stalin. With the classical fascist with Mussolini, it was
5148860	5153900	much more like the Soviet Union, it was much more state direct control of things. And also,
5153900	5159340	in Japan, there was a lot of there's a lot of nationalization in Japan. With Hitler was unique,
5159340	5166060	because he had no problem taking control of businesses. But he was all but he would always
5166060	5172140	ultimately give them to party elites to control. So they were owned privately. But they did
5172140	5178620	ultimately still work for the government. It's just that the if you had a position in the Nazi
5178620	5183660	Party, you were allowed to enrich yourself off of these businesses. Can I take it still wasn't
5183660	5187420	any sort of free market by any stretch of the imagination, though? Yeah, sorry. Can I be the
5187420	5191180	worst? Can I take a two minute? I just need to use the washrooms for quickly. Yeah, no problem.
5191180	5195340	No problem. Sorry about going on my own rent. So we're going on my own rent, by the way. I'm not
5195340	5205980	even done it. But yeah. Um, hello, chat. How's it going? You know what, I probably should have
5205980	5212860	also rewatched my video. You know, if I was going to be talking about the the in depth ideas of my
5212860	5221740	video, I probably should have also rewatched it. Oops. Here, you know what, maybe I'll if you guys
5221740	5232620	want to see it. I cite all the books that I use in the video. Here. I'll post it in the YouTube
5232620	5245260	chat if you guys like. Here it is. Hopefully that is allowed. Oh, didn't appear. I can't post a link
5245260	5254620	in the YouTube chat here. If I do like, it's called three forms of fascism. By short, fat,
5255260	5259980	otaku. There are no depths your ideas dude, read, watch the video, read the books, man.
5261980	5269820	Dead being unprepared. Okay, here, here. So let me I'll post this in YouTube and in Twitch. Okay.
5269820	5279900	And I would highly recommend you guys check out the reading list in there.
5281100	5285980	If you don't mind. I'll post in Twitch too. Here it is in Twitch. This is my Twitch account. Hello.
5287740	5291980	Um, and the books that I cited were George Sorrell's reflections on violence.
5291980	5297580	Um, the mass psychology of fascism, the open society and its enemies.
5299420	5305020	Uh, the origins of totalitarianism. Um, what was there was another big one.
5307100	5312060	I can't recall. Shit. I did. I debuted my camp for the video.
5316460	5321180	There's one more that I can't remember what it was called. Oh, neither right nor left.
5321820	5328060	By Zeeb sternhill. That's a very boring book, but it's packed full of information. So chat,
5328060	5332460	that's all the that's all the books that I used. And please consider checking the video
5332460	5342940	because I also haven't rewatched it. So oops. Um, I I am back. What's up?
5343500	5347980	Apparently, there's like a big thing getting dropped right now with laughs saying that
5347980	5351420	destiny sleeps with all the females that he streams within grooms them.
5352140	5358220	Uh, and somebody said that he might've my name might've been dropped. Um, which if that's the
5358220	5363420	case, there's a big problem because that's not true at all. We were fully platonic. So,
5364540	5369500	uh, I don't really want somebody. I have a husband actually. Oh, okay. All right. Well,
5369500	5372140	there you go. Well, I just want to make somebody who's like lying about
5373100	5379580	my friend being a groomer and then using my name. Um, yeah, that's, yeah, that's going to
5379580	5385580	be a problem. So I'm just having somebody check. Okay. That's true. Cause if, okay.
5387340	5390860	I'm just getting somebody to check through the clip and see if, uh, if my name is actually
5390860	5397020	being dropped or not. I see. Does that mean that we'll have to talk another time and you have to
5397020	5404460	go and you have to go to war against this person? We'll see. Okay. Well, I'll see if I can finish
5404460	5408060	up. So yeah, by the way, sorry about my own scatterbrainness because I also haven't watched
5408060	5415020	the video in like a month. Um, but basically the two prongs of Mussolini's fascism was
5415020	5422540	one violence for violence sake. And two was, um, was capitalism is an internationalist movement.
5422540	5426860	And so the, so the revolution has to be a nationalist revolution. And he based that on
5426860	5433980	this idea that Italy fought very hard to, to unify during its three wars of unification.
5434780	5441180	The final war of unification was what we call world war one. And after Italy sacrificed half
5441180	5448460	a million men and went into economic debt, the other, um, the other world war one victors,
5448460	5454380	most notably the Americans basically denied Italy's promise because they were promised by
5454380	5458540	France and Britain, certain components of the Austrian empire that had ethnically Italian
5458540	5463340	people living there. And the Americans said, ah, no, you don't get that actually. And so
5463340	5467500	the socialists, the Italian socialists at the time, they were writing political theory
5467500	5473260	about what they called the proletarian nation. And the proletarian nation was this idea that
5473260	5478220	if we have a proletariat class of people that are being exploited by the bourgeois,
5478940	5484220	you also have proletarian nations that are exploited by bourgeois nations.
5484220	5490220	So you have nations that are, that are highly developed, highly financial. They purchase the
5490220	5494460	products of other nations. They come into other nations with their foreign money and they,
5494460	5499340	and they make these nations dependent on them and their commerce. And then the proletarian nations
5499340	5502860	have no choice to basically go along with whatever is being given to them.
5503420	5508700	And this is how the Italian socialists viewed what they called the mutilated victory,
5508700	5517260	which was when Italy lost a lot and gained nothing in world war one. And it was kind of this view
5517260	5522140	that shaped Mussolini's view of if we're going to be revolting against capitalism,
5522140	5526380	it's gotta be a nationalist revolt. And that's where you get classical fascism.
5526380	5531980	And then Hitler didn't care so much about the whole anti-capitalist thing,
5531980	5536380	though he did try to frame the anti-capitalist stuff as being anti-Jewish stuff.
5538860	5545020	And then after those two, you have the modern day fascists. And the modern day fascists are,
5545020	5550620	they're the libertarian fascists, which sounds like insane if you actually think of it. But
5551340	5556300	basically their idea is fascist ideology without a fascist state.
5557500	5560620	And that's where you have like a lot of, a lot of like modern day,
5561900	5568300	like dissident right people, they call them Christo-fascists sometimes, Islamo-fascists,
5568300	5571820	you know, those people that we see floating around the right wing right now,
5572460	5576700	that's those people. It's fascist ideology without a fascist state.
5576700	5584620	So do you think then that in pockets of the alt-right there is a growing and moving
5584620	5591420	fascistic state, basically? It is specifically post-fascist,
5591420	5595180	because they don't care about any of Sorel's work. They don't care about Sorel's conception
5595180	5599340	of socialism or about Mussolini's conception of the corporative economy. They don't care about
5599340	5609020	any of that stuff. For them it is fascist tactics. And it's like, what's the word, it's like,
5614300	5622460	it's something like violence as its own virtue pushed to the extreme, because all forms of
5622460	5626380	libertarianism, libertarian capitalism, libertarian socialism, and libertarian fascism,
5626380	5631020	they all view politics as violence itself. So if you go to a ballot box and you cast a vote,
5631580	5635340	to them that is the same thing as punching someone in the street.
5636060	5640700	Because if you're casting a vote for say a law, and that law is now being enforced on somebody
5640700	5645820	who didn't vote for the law, and then they break the law, the police have to come in,
5645820	5651900	make them follow the law, punish them if they don't, to the entire libertarian wing
5652780	5658540	of politics, socialist, fascist, capitalist. They all view politics as inherently violent. They view
5658540	5666380	voting as violent. They view just because it's all society imposing itself on you.
5667660	5668380	So I think...
5669260	5674460	Do they think their bosses are violent? Do they think any form... Do you think parents
5674460	5677020	are violent towards their children, even if they're not physically abusing them,
5677020	5681820	they're just like dictating them? If everything's violence, then nothing is violence.
5683500	5687260	I hate the violence argument of being like, if somebody imposes their will on you, it's violence.
5687820	5692540	No, it's posing their will on you. We have words for these things. If somebody coerces you,
5692540	5696300	it's called coercion. We already have a word for that thing. We don't need to call it violence.
5696300	5697500	We have the word coercion.
5699980	5705180	You see... What was his name? Was it Proudhon? Proudhon wrote something like property is theft.
5705180	5709740	The idea of property is theft is that if you've taken property from the common unclaimed
5709740	5714940	property, you have now exclusivized it. So you build your little house and now nobody else can
5714940	5721180	access that house. It's no longer common anymore. So property as a concept is always stealing from
5721180	5725580	everyone else. It's a ridiculous concept, but that's kind of how a lot of people think.
5726700	5729020	This is a very common libertarian thing specifically.
5729980	5737260	Proudhon was an anarchist leftist. This does kind of filter out through because, for example,
5737260	5743500	I've listened to Vash say this. Vash has said at least a few times that employment in a capitalist
5743500	5748780	system is always exploitative, even if you consent because of the power dynamics involved
5748780	5753420	and the fact that you need money and your boss has money, your boss controls the workplace.
5753420	5762860	It's always some form of violence. I've seen anarcho-capitalists will say that taxation,
5763820	5767420	the taxation is theft thing, right? Where it's like, well, you never consent to that.
5767420	5769820	The government always comes in and takes your taxes.
5769820	5776300	So every flavor of libertarianism has a redefinition of violence and coercion
5776300	5780060	that I'm personally not comfortable with. And when it comes to libertarian fascists,
5780940	5784220	they, for them, it is the voting process.
5784780	5789180	For them, the voting process is the same thing as punching someone in the face.
5792700	5797420	Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, anarchists are crazy to me in a lot of ways. Like,
5797980	5802700	yes, this is this is why so like politics in political theory, this is part of why I've
5802700	5806940	actually like pulled back a little bit from politics is multifolded. Number one,
5806940	5809660	there's not a lot of interest in politics right now, which is unfortunate.
5810140	5815740	Number two, I try to do my best to be like decently. Like I realize I'm a person who
5815740	5821500	speaks with a lot of like authority in my voice. Like I make, I make statements, right? And I often
5821500	5828060	don't caveat maybe as much as I should or always need to. And I realized that political theory
5828060	5834140	and political science is a field that I'm not an expert in, um, and is highly complex.
5835020	5839020	And I'm always extremely reticent to
5843180	5849500	add into a world that's already like adding to add into a court of like, conversation,
5850220	5855180	that more muddying and more garbage, right? Because if I'm like sharing information,
5855180	5858940	that's incorrect. That's bad, even if I'm not intending to.
5859980	5863820	Well, firstly, so if we're gonna back up, then sorry for dragging you back in to the vortex.
5863900	5868060	No, you're good. It is interesting. I find it really, especially political theory. I
5868060	5873020	really love political theory. I just, one thing I like think about a lot when I think about
5873020	5879740	politics that I think is really important to me is that when people sell worldviews, specifically
5879740	5885820	like political ideologies that are selling a lie to everyone and will make the world a worse place
5885820	5891340	for not only the people who don't hold that value and are like maybe antagonistic to it,
5891340	5894700	but it'll actually make the world worse for even those holding the value.
5894700	5899180	I think that those ideas need to be like bludgeoned brutally out of the court of common,
5899180	5904300	like thing, not by deplatforming them, by the way, by like proving why they're fucking stupid
5904300	5909340	and that we shouldn't listen to them. Right. And I, I feel like this hasn't been done.
5909340	5912460	I feel like it has been done pretty well with anarchists. The problem is that
5915020	5921020	there's been this growing anti-institutional movement for a lot of good reasons, actually,
5921020	5925580	because the institutions are failing and the institutions are failing for a ton of reasons.
5925580	5930780	Right. Most of which I probably don't understand. One of them is that young people tend not to vote.
5932060	5937900	There is an unfettered corruption within like money and lobbying and who can like basically
5937900	5942780	like buy the ear of politicians. Right. There is the nepotism that occurs within government
5942780	5946540	bureaucracies of like hiring their family members and their friends. First and foremost,
5946540	5950300	there is like all of these layers of things that seem to be like breaking our institutions,
5950300	5955980	even in academia. Right. Academia is, I mean, I love science and I love academics,
5955980	5960780	but there's really big problems with it. For example, like there is kind of an ivory tower
5960780	5965180	issue within academia where they really don't touch grass a lot. They don't really understand
5965180	5969260	like normal people. Right. When I tell academics, for example, that even in Canada,
5970140	5974860	the bulk of the population still doesn't have a bachelor's degree. They say, that can't be true.
5975500	5979980	Everyone I know and my extended family all has bachelor's degrees. And I'm just like,
5980300	5985500	yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, but that's just because you've never gone to a gas plant
5985500	5990540	where you drive up. It's a parking lot as wide as the fucking sea. It's just a cement sea
5990540	5996860	with 80000 white trucks and just blue men and blue overalls are getting out and walking into
5996860	6001820	this power plant. That is like that is that is a very common experience of North America
6001820	6006780	that like academia has no conception of. Right. Absolutely. Absolutely. And like,
6006780	6011500	space culture has ruined academia as well. Right. Like it has it is Rooney. It is bad
6011500	6015740	for academics. It is anti-scientific in many ways. And it's a really big problem.
6015740	6019900	Right. And so like these ants, anti-institutionalists have validity.
6019900	6023420	And so I worry, though, that the answer the anti-institutionalist is going to lead into
6023420	6028140	the anarchist. And I think like the anarchist worldview, I don't know how if the like more
6028140	6033980	anarchist worldviews don't pop off, that we don't fall into like civil war because I completely
6033980	6039740	agree. Yeah. The problem is that anarchy is a lie. Anarchy is a lie. It's a lie. And it is
6039740	6045100	worse for everyone. Every single person will be worse off for anarchy. This is self-evident.
6045100	6049260	But the problem is that I feel like, again, I think it's important to criticize your own in
6049260	6052780	group, my own in group, the liberals and the moderates are trying to be like, yeah,
6052780	6058140	but these institutions do work. It's like they do, but they there's massive problems.
6058140	6061980	There are major areas where they're not working, working very well. And it's like,
6061980	6065980	the problem is that we have a really big, old, slow moving ship and we haven't been
6065980	6069580	maintaining it very well. And there's rats in, you know, and there's rats in the attic.
6070300	6074620	And we need to look at this. Right. They're chewing out the bottom. And the moderate
6074620	6078860	progressives are hesitant to engage in this because they're afraid that if they give any,
6078860	6083180	any credence to anti-institutionalist rhetoric, that they're going to become conspiratorial.
6083900	6087260	You see it the moment, the moment I say this, I know there's going to be some
6087260	6090540	schizo poster in my chappy, like, yeah, and the Jews are actually lizards.
6091980	6096300	And it's all lots of the vaccines. You're just like, stop, like,
6096300	6100940	fuck, there are criticisms to be levied, but your conclusions are wrong. Like, chill out.
6103100	6110540	So you have basically described like my life story, like to a T. Exactly. So I was here,
6110540	6114220	you know, I will toot my own horn a little bit. OK, I'll fluff myself just slightly.
6115100	6122220	Um, I was maybe considered one of those gifted children that didn't really take off in adulthood.
6122220	6126620	It's a pretty common story. I was offered like I was offered the choice to skip three grades
6126620	6130940	throughout grade school. I always said no, because I like my friends. I liked my friends. I don't
6130940	6137420	talk to him anymore. I probably should have taken it. But, you know, I was I was the kid who got
6137420	6143020	90 percent or higher on everything and never did any studying and never did any homework and just
6143020	6149260	floated through school, no problem. And I had a giant, big, fat ego about it, you know.
6151180	6155420	And then I got to university and didn't know how to actually study and didn't know how to live on
6155420	6159900	my own and I failed out. It's a pretty common story, I think. Right. So that's why I took
6159900	6163900	four years to to do a seven year degree. And I get disillusioned too, right? Like,
6163900	6166540	I understand my people like, I don't really want to go to university. Like,
6166540	6171020	what a waste of my fucking time, because like, this is why I say not all degrees are the same.
6171020	6176460	Right. The reality is that, like, I'm working in a master's lab and people are going to think I'm
6176460	6182620	cocky for this. But the reality is, like, my undergrad was I don't know how the fuck I looked
6182620	6188220	into my undergrad. Holy shit. Like most people, my undergrad, it's kind of known now that people
6188220	6192620	who go to my undergrad program and do an honors program in psychology usually are about a year
6192620	6197020	and a half ahead of anyone else. But when they enter a clinical psych Ph.D. master's program,
6197100	6199740	which is like the highest tier of education you can get in psychology.
6200940	6205500	And it's it's insane how much I can like echo that, even though I've been out of my undergrad
6205500	6210380	for a couple of years. Like, it's insane. It's insanely true. Like, not all degrees are the
6210380	6213420	same. This is why I like when somebody's like, yeah, but I have a bachelor's in biology. I'm
6213420	6218540	an authority on it. I'm like, well, did you get C's? Because then I don't know. Also,
6218540	6222300	most people who go to university realize that they don't need their bio degree. They need to get
6222300	6227500	enough of a grade so that they can get the piece of paper so that they can work in whatever other
6227500	6231500	field they actually want to work in and make money in. Right. And so it's like most people do pump
6231500	6235980	and dump. They study and cram like two nights before their exams and then they dump it all
6235980	6239980	onto a piece of paper and then they walk away and they're like, all right, beer and forget time.
6239980	6243820	And it's like, you're not learning this material in the way that somebody who, for example,
6243820	6247900	studies one hour every single day and really tries to consume and absorb it, which is fine,
6247900	6251340	by the way. Like if you just need the piece of paper, I don't expect you to study in any
6251340	6255100	different way. Like that makes the most sense. To be honest, you maximize your enjoyment of
6255100	6259580	the university experience and you still get the degree at the end of the day. Like that makes
6259580	6263420	sense to me. Right. But like so many people cope and try to pretend like these things are all the
6263420	6268140	same when it's like, the reality is like, I did the nerd shit. I did an hour every single day.
6268140	6271900	I never pulled a single all-nighter. I never started studying a night before a test ever.
6271900	6275980	I was always studying three to four weeks beforehand. I was studying at all times,
6275980	6280940	September, like first, second day of class. I was already building myself self-tests and testing
6280940	6284620	myself on the concepts that I learned. I was reading ahead. Like I was a fucking nerd,
6284620	6289020	which is losership, by the way. Most people don't need to do this. I just actually want to be a
6289020	6292860	scientist in this field. Like I actually, this is what I want to do. I wouldn't recommend most
6292860	6296220	people who do a psych degree to do what I want to do. If you just like want to like go into HR or
6296220	6300300	shit like that, you don't, you don't need to do what I'm doing, but these things are not the same.
6300300	6303980	But the problem is that people keep trying to act like they are the same. And then the
6303980	6308460	anti-introduce lines are like, they're fucking obviously not the same thing, right? There's
6308460	6313180	obviously garbage degrees. There's obviously stupid morons who don't know anything.
6313820	6317740	Yeah. I have one of the garbage degrees. Well, see, that also sounds like me too, because
6317740	6323340	so I was, I was like a young communist, you know, being 19, 20 years old, thinking I knew how the
6323340	6327340	whole world worked, you know, drum daddy. Well, here's the thing. It was partially I didn't know
6327340	6332140	how to, didn't know how to study, didn't know how to work, didn't know how to live without my
6332140	6337580	parents. But also, I mean, I started to actually get attention from women more than I had in high
6337580	6343340	school. And that, that also changed how I was viewing, viewing school. So I dropped out after
6343340	6349020	a couple years, went to go work blue collar. First time I'd ever done that. I always floated by just
6349020	6355180	on my natural talents and it finally failed. So I worked a blue collar night shift job for a while.
6355180	6360620	Actually, no, no, no, no, hold on. Sorry. Sorry. I worked for municipalities. So public sector,
6361500	6366940	plowing snow, picking up garbage, cutting grass, whenever you see, whenever you see someone in a
6366940	6371980	park doing a work, like with a vest and a helmet on, and you kind of ignore his existence. That
6371980	6377260	was me. I did that for two years. And the one thing that made me not a socialist anymore was
6377260	6382060	working with the working class. Like my God, that changed my entire outlook on life was doing that
6382060	6385980	job. And then I was like, okay, you know, I think I should go back to school. So there were some
6385980	6389580	other like personal problems in there. They don't really matter too much for the story. I went back
6389580	6394220	to school though. And I found out when I went back to school, I was like, Oh, I can, I know how to
6394460	6398940	work now. And getting the degree was actually really easy. And in fact, I worked night. That's
6398940	6402540	when I worked night shift and did the degree during the day. And that kind of sucked. But I
6402540	6409900	mean, I came out with no debt. So man, yeah, taking time off between like, the number one
6409900	6416060	thing I could recommend any high school student is unless you know, for fucking sure, take a year,
6416060	6423580	just take a year. Because you don't like, ideally, you shouldn't have to treat university like you do
6423580	6427420	public education, public education, you just gotta fucking get through it. I don't remember.
6428220	6433100	I remember getting into like one of my mathematics 100 class in university and looking at shit and
6433100	6437500	being like, I don't feel like I've ever learned this. I remember getting into my English classes
6437500	6442140	and being like, I don't know what grammar is. Like, I've never heard of these things, right?
6442780	6447820	Like, I feel like I really did most of my like, learning in university, which like, you know,
6447820	6451020	proves that the failing of our public education system, but also like your approach to it is
6451020	6453980	different. Like you just realize you do want to pump and dump. You're like, I fucking hate this
6453980	6458780	shit. I don't want to do it. I just want to get through this forced schooling. And it's like,
6458780	6462940	God, don't do that with university if you can avoid it. Like, this is why I'm like really big
6462940	6466300	on technical schools. Like I would always say before somebody should go to university, you
6466300	6469900	should go to a technical school. Like unless you know precisely what you want to do, and it requires
6469900	6475020	a university pathway, do technical, get a trade, even if you're not sure what you want to do,
6475020	6479260	getting some sort of certificate so that you have a fallback plan B like trade that you can always
6479260	6484860	do is such a base move. Like if you're really uncertain, just like do a year getting like
6484860	6491660	a trade in hairdressing, cosmetology, like those are trades. There's lots of like youth work
6491660	6495900	certificates that you can get. So you can do like respite care and government like government kind
6495900	6501100	of contracted stuff that pays really well. It's got good contracting, but it's like six, like six
6501100	6507420	months to like a year max of training. Yeah, I'm just like really big about pushing trades more.
6507420	6512060	And I think this is where I think Europe is really out-competing North America in our education
6512060	6516220	academic system specifically is right as they've like shortened all of their bachelor's to like
6516220	6520220	three years on average. And they really try to streamline it of recognizing like,
6521100	6525820	we're trying to prepare you for a occupation, right? So like if you're taking a degree,
6525820	6529260	you're moving the direction of working within that field. And we're going to tailor
6529260	6534620	our bachelor's in that direction, like for the most part, which is just like, it makes way more
6534620	6538860	sense, right? Like that's why like my friends in like the EU will be like, I already got a PhD at
6538860	6546780	like eight years old. And I'm like, fuck you. Yeah. You know, for me, like I went to university
6546780	6551740	because I was expected to based on my immense success in high school and in grade school.
6551740	6556380	And it was one of the worst decisions in my life. I fucking ruined myself. To be fair,
6556380	6562300	like I came out of it pretty well in the end. Like I was working on a master's and then I realized
6562300	6565580	I don't really want to do I thought I wanted to be a professor. I was like, I want to be a professor.
6565580	6568780	And then the channel took off. So I guess I want to do this. And I do want to do this. So you know,
6568780	6575820	it all worked out in the end. But like, I have a friend who was also pretty intelligent, but he's
6575820	6580700	like, you know what, I want to be a plumber. And he got like a plumber's apprenticeship with
6580700	6583820	somebody else who is a plumber in the city. And he's doing fine for himself. You know,
6584780	6588780	I think I think the X, even though university is very important, the expectation that everyone
6588780	6592860	should go to it probably isn't that good for us. It's not good because it's not what university
6592860	6599740	was even designed for. Like university should be for fucking loser fucks like me who want to like
6599740	6604540	study and do research and wrestle with ideas and inquire. And the reality is like, the problem is
6604540	6609020	that our society has convinced us that everyone needs to do this and that you're a bad person if
6609020	6613020	you're not doing it. It's like, that's not fucking true. Like most people have kids, they've worked,
6613020	6617340	they've got family, they don't have fucking time to be like, I wonder what it means to be a human.
6617340	6622140	And it's fine. Like if you're interested in that, that's based, but I don't think everyone's
6622140	6626460	actually required to do that at all time. And it's like, this is actually like, I just said in my,
6626460	6631420	my grad like statement of intent. And I like opened my statement of intent by basically being
6631420	6637660	like, university used to be a place of like inquiry and scholarship. And unfortunately,
6637660	6642540	at least on an undergraduate level, like it no longer is that, which is why in part, I want to
6642540	6647260	go to graduate school because in many more ways, graduate school is, especially in thesis-based
6647260	6652060	programs, that space where the whole goal of you being there isn't to rush through and get the
6652060	6657260	degree. The goal is to like be mentored by greater minds than yourself to stand on the shoulders of
6657260	6662220	giants and like look into space and wonder why. Like that's the point of university. That's what
6662220	6667660	makes it fucking cool. But now like university is just like this cringey shit. And it's, it's not
6667660	6672460	like it's not, it's not all bad. Like the institution itself still works to some extent,
6672460	6677260	but it's like, if we can't be honest about the failings of it, then how the fuck are we ever
6677260	6681820	going to correct it? And if we lie about the failings of it, all you do, we've already proven
6681820	6685500	this, is you radicalize the extreme who like don't understand it. Like, well, if they're not
6685500	6689100	going to be willing to talk about it and they keep lying that the institution's broken, it must mean
6689100	6694140	that there's some deep sinister plot and you know, like the, the higher ups, the great bourgeois are
6694140	6697500	in on it and they're trying to control us and they're lying because they don't want us to know
6697500	6701260	but I see it, I see the truth and I see through all the murk and the misery and right and then,
6701260	6705180	and then build into this like paranoid thing. You have a great Alex Jones voice.
6707180	6711260	Is that what I'm doing? You kind of slip into it sometimes. Yeah.
6713180	6715820	You know what you should do? You should get like a tinfoil hat off to the side and just
6715820	6723980	put it on whenever you do one of those. But yeah, that, that definitely, are you,
6723980	6730300	hold on. I'm going to be tactful. Have you revealed your age? Yeah, I'm 28.
6731180	6737340	Okay. Was it, you're, you're a bit younger than me. Was it the case when you were in high school
6737340	6740620	and you were talking to guidance counselors about what to do after you graduate,
6741180	6744860	that they were really, were they still really pushing hard for people to become high school
6744860	6753420	teachers? Not in my, I don't remember. I, I'm a bitch. I've been a disagreeable child since the
6753420	6757580	moment I was fucking born. Okay. I've always been like, I do it my own way. Don't fucking talk to
6757580	6761820	me. Don't, don't tell me what to do. I know. Right. Like that's, uh, that's my propensity.
6762700	6766380	Yeah. I've worked really hard on it because it's fucking annoying and it's not very,
6766380	6769980	how it's bad epistemic humility. And I really come to value that. But, uh,
6771020	6774460	you know, when I was 18, I didn't have it. And I had decided at that point that I was
6774460	6778380	going to be a vet and I had known that since grade like nine, that was my plan.
6778380	6782380	So I sat down the forced guidance counselor thing and I was like, I don't need this.
6782380	6786060	I've known since grade nine, I'm going to go to the university to get a pre-vet Medicaid,
6786060	6789900	pre-vet, uh, education. And then I'm going to go to, and then I listed like the three
6789900	6793660	major universities and I'm going to specialize in equine at this university, ideally with this
6793660	6798220	professor, if I can, I don't need your help. I've already got it figured out. Can I leave now? And
6798220	6802940	she was like, but have you ever thought about going into nursing? And I was like, she wanted
6802940	6807100	nurse. I was in a Dutch school. So I was just like nurses and engineers for everyone. And I was like,
6807500	6811740	my mom's a nurse. I'm not going to be a nurse. Hashtag mommy issues. So yeah.
6813900	6819820	Jesus. Well, for me, something like one third of my graduating class in high school ended
6819820	6824780	up going into some sort of concurrent education program because they pushed high school teachers
6824780	6828860	that hard. Everyone wanted to be a high school teacher. They were talking about the big high
6828860	6832940	school teacher shortage coming up. There'll be so many jobs. And now my generation over
6832940	6836220	here in Ontario, there's so many high school teachers and no one has any work.
6837260	6841900	Like, well, that didn't work out for me. Like I took a drama class in grade 11
6842860	6846540	and something kind of sparked in me that felt different for everything else I had done in
6846540	6850540	school. But I was kind of, I was kind of expected by my parents to do something,
6851260	6857180	something more tangible. So I, uh, I, I suppressed it and I got an English lit degree.
6858220	6862780	Yes. Well, actually I was originally going for programming, but I changed over to English lit
6862780	6868460	after one year. Cause I was like, nope, not for me. I just like the stories, man. I just want to
6868460	6874140	study stories. Yeah. Kind of, kind of, but like in, in, in grade school, I think starting in grade
6874140	6877500	six, I started learning basic programming just to like, I wanted to make my own video games. I'm,
6877500	6881180	I'm a big gamer at heart. I want to make my own video games. So I was making computer games in
6881180	6885020	grade six and I was like, I can be a programmer. And then I realized, fuck, I don't want to be a
6885020	6889660	programmer. This sucks. I can, if you ask me a programmer right now, I probably could, but like,
6889660	6895980	I do it for myself now, you know? Um, but, but drama, the drama class was it sparked something
6895980	6900300	and then I suppressed it basically until we started the YouTube channel, me and my friends.
6900300	6905100	And I was like, Oh, this is what it is. This is what I want to do. Actually. I like making videos,
6905100	6910140	like talking to people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's, that's what I do. Had a great conversation
6910140	6915740	with Stardust a couple of days ago. Yeah. Cool. What'd you guys talk about? I authoritarian
6915740	6921100	pilled her. Oh, really? I convinced her that it's based or what does that mean?
6921100	6928940	Yes. Yes. I gave her the anti-democracy pill. Okay. Um, here's the thing. I'm not even an
6928940	6932380	anti like, I'm not an anti-democratic kind of guy. Like I, I'm still ultimately like a liberal,
6932380	6937020	like pro democracy, pro capitalism, pro, you know, functional institutions. But like,
6937020	6942380	I know the anti-democratic arguments very well, partially for making the fascism video.
6942380	6945820	So I know how they think. And I was like, I'm going to, you know, she, she was, she was cool
6945820	6949420	with it. Like it was okay. I was like, I'm going to troll Stardust a bit here and I'm going to try
6949420	6955420	to convince her that, that overthrowing democracy is the way to go. So I gave her all the hardest
6955420	6959980	arguments that I could, and she was just like, Oh shit. I was like, don't worry. Don't worry. We
6959980	6963980	can answer all these. It was, it was just, it was really fun. She's actually great. She's a great
6963980	6969420	sport. She's very funny. I really enjoyed talking to her. Good. I'm glad you enjoy talking to her.
6969420	6976700	Yeah. She's a very nice woman. Do you want me, do you want me to authoritarian pill you?
6979100	6982620	I'm an uppity bitch. I already told you I am way more disagreeable.
6982620	6988140	Even if I don't have reasons, I'm just like, I already, I just, you probably will. I am dubious
6988140	6993900	that you can do it. Not even because I necessarily can like out contend with it. I just, I'm just not
6993900	6998940	as agreeable. It's just, it's just kind of fun. It's something that it's just kind of like a fun
6998940	7005580	little thing. You can try. I'm curious to see. Oh, sure. Uh, what was that? I know there's what,
7005580	7011260	um, new taftages, right? I love tough. She's great. I talked to her all the time. She's,
7011260	7019260	she's got a big brain and big boobah. Well, I wasn't going to say it. No, actually, um,
7019260	7028300	after her, what I said she has a nice boobah. Okay. Um, after her, um, her first discussion
7028300	7031900	with destiny, I messaged her and I was like, you know, you're, you're really cool. Like I really
7031900	7036540	enjoyed your appearance on destiny. And then she immediately follows me back. Okay. And it's like
7036540	7041180	in my DMS, she's like, Oh my God, are you the real SFO? I've been watching your videos for years.
7041180	7046860	And I was like, um, all right. But she's, she's, she's really nice. She's really smart. Um,
7046860	7053260	I love bouncing ideas off of her, but she threw this around in a stream with destiny
7054220	7059420	and here, let me just, I'll just post it in the DM. Have you seen this before testing
7059420	7062780	theories of American politics, elites, interest groups, and average citizens.
7066380	7075340	Okay. So the TLDR of this study is basically, it correlates a voter's preferences to policy
7075340	7082780	outcomes such that the lowest income bracket in the United States, who they vote for makes
7082780	7087660	no difference at whatsoever. So if you're a poor person and you vote for a candidate,
7087660	7092940	because he says he will implement policies X, Y, and Z, the chances he will actually implement
7092940	7099740	policies X, Y, and Z is basically nothing. There's a zero correlation. However, at the highest income
7099740	7108780	bracket, the correlation is 0.6. So there's a lot of people who are, who are very anti anti-democratic
7108860	7114860	oriented who like to lean on this study and say, look, voting doesn't matter. It's all what the
7114860	7120540	upper-class wants. And that's just how it's going to be. And this is like the entryway into the
7120540	7126780	anti-democracy component of the internet is usually this study. Does anybody look up any
7126780	7131340	counter studies that like, uh, challenge this or like any meta analysis that challenges?
7131340	7137340	Um, well, in, in the destiny TAFTAD discussion, he said that there was some problems with
7137340	7142860	reproducing it, but I don't know the full details of reproducing it. If what, what the problems
7142860	7150300	were, but, um, there's a, there's a political theory that also comes out of the, it's always
7150300	7154300	the fucking Italians, you know, it comes out of the, it comes out of the Italians called elite
7154300	7161980	theory. And the idea is basically just that democracy is a post hoc justification of what
7162060	7165820	the elites want and they will make you vote for it using propaganda.
7169420	7170620	Hmm. Interesting.
7171500	7177180	And, and when they talk about this sort of thing, they have some real world examples they can cite.
7177180	7181900	So for example, these people believe that the problem of NIMBYism is a uniquely democratic
7181900	7188780	problem. And they'll point out the urban sprawl issue in LA as being the best example of what
7188780	7192540	they're talking about. So I'm sure you've been to LA. I think, I think I've actually seen you
7192540	7196620	stream that. Haven't you? No, that was Miami. You were doing an IRL with Miami with destiny,
7196620	7201420	but anyway, most cities have this problem. They have urban sprawl. So hundreds of miles
7201420	7207100	of just tiny shitty little houses and tiny shitty little backyards, no apartment blocks.
7207740	7213820	And everyone's just renting these falling apart, little shit shacks. And, and, and the poor have
7213820	7218700	nowhere to live. And the land owners don't want the situation to change because that will ruin
7219340	7224300	property investment. So the correct thing to do to solve the issue would be to build apartment
7224300	7228380	blocks. So now there's apartments, they're cheaper. Poor people can go live there. That
7228380	7234460	reduces demand on housing. So now suddenly you have more people in one place in the apartment
7234460	7239420	block. Now suddenly house prices go down. The middle class can have houses again, but every
7239420	7244700	single landowner will never vote for a zoning change that actually allows you to build apartment
7244700	7250940	blocks in these neighborhoods. Because that means that their housing prices, the value of their
7250940	7258700	investment will just plummet into the ground. And so this is an instance where every single voter
7258700	7263900	will always vote for what is best for them and what is worst for society and things don't get
7263900	7269900	changed. And they use this model to talk about prisons. Nobody wants a prison in their backyard.
7269900	7273660	Nobody wants prisoners released into their community. They use it to talk about nuclear
7273660	7280540	power. Nobody wants the nuclear reactor in their town because everyone has the shadow of Chernobyl
7280540	7286780	over their minds. And so basically, if you had, say, a benevolent philosopher king,
7287500	7292460	he would just build the apartment blocks as society needs them, because he has absolute
7292460	7296780	authority. He could just build the nuclear reactor. He could just build the prison. He
7296780	7302140	could do what is good for everyone and ignore the votes of the people who basically,
7302940	7307820	they make, like, they're not being unreasonable. They make rational decisions. But it's the
7307820	7311180	collective rational decisions of every individual that makes society worse.
7315020	7318860	And so this is kind of where the anti-democratic Yeah.
7321820	7328380	Yeah. How do you feel about gatekept democracy? I'd be curious what you think about that. So
7328460	7332700	there's some element of gatekeeping, for example, like people can't vote unless they
7333580	7338220	meet a bare minimum test, which could be as simple as like, can you name three candidates on the
7338220	7342060	ballot or like something like that? I guess that would work for you guys, because you guys
7342060	7347980	typically only have two on ballots. But I'm a Canadian. Oh, yeah, you're Canadian. Fuck,
7347980	7353420	I always seem to forget that you're Canadian. Don't I have the accent? Yeah.
7353420	7357740	Uh, I don't know. I don't really think Canadians have an accent, so.
7358620	7360300	All right, really? I mean, I hear it in you sometimes.
7362220	7367900	You have like an Albertan accent for sure. Do I? I don't know. I mean, probably. Probably
7367900	7371820	technically, yes. I just don't hear like a major deviation from Americans other than like a couple
7371820	7377900	of our like, ah, like ah sounds usually that are different. I sometimes slip into a Newfoundland
7377900	7382540	accent because that's where my family's from. And I spent like some of my youth there. But for the
7382540	7390700	most part, I'm pure Ontario. So gate kept democracy. There's like a few forms of that.
7390700	7394700	So some people, you know, believe that should only be landowners, because if you're a landowner,
7394700	7401020	you have like, yeah, that's a bad one. I don't like that. And an investment. It is. I agree,
7401020	7404780	it's a bad one. But just to steel man their argument, you have an investment that needs
7404780	7409580	protecting. So if you own land, somebody else doesn't own land, you probably have more of a
7409580	7412860	buy in into the stability of the country because you have more to lose. That's gonna be their
7412860	7418700	argument. Some people based on the draft, which is why women, they believe women shouldn't vote
7418700	7422540	and men should because if you're voting for the country to go to war, you should have to be the
7422540	7427580	one who dies in that war. And there's maybe something to that argument because death is
7427580	7437420	kind of final. I know. Yeah, that's kind of related to like the Starship Troopers argument where
7437420	7443420	you only get the you can only get the opportunity to vote if you if you either work for the
7443420	7447340	government for two years or for the military for two years. That's how it was in Starship Troopers.
7449660	7456060	Did you hear the news? What's the news? So I don't know what's going on. But destiny just
7456060	7461340	started his streams saying that he's going nuclear. So I'm curious if you'd want to
7461340	7466220	watch some of that with me. There's a clip I'm I don't want to totally pivot. But I feel like
7466220	7469420	I'd be interested to get your thoughts on a couple of clips that have been sent to me.
7470300	7473900	Sure, sure. I mean, I guess I could like 30 seconds to do this up. Um,
7475260	7479020	because I really like this is really interesting. I just know that everyone is going to be
7479020	7482220	distracted and wants you to watch this right now. And I'm getting like pummeled with DMS about it
7482220	7486220	right now. Also, like if you want me to bow out, you know, it's your show. You just let me know,
7486220	7488940	right? I don't want to I want to actually get your thoughts on it because I think you're actually
7488940	7494620	really good. I like how you think a lot. Oh, really? I don't think I wouldn't be able to
7494620	7498700	categorize at all. Ah, okay. I think you actually do really good critical thinking.
7499420	7504460	Oh, well, thanks. I always view myself as exceptionally stupid. Like, I've had some people
7504460	7508780	ask, like, despite my academic, like early academic success, I've had some people ask you
7508780	7514300	some very tough questions. And I'm like, I don't fucking know. I don't know. But here, I'll TLDR
7514300	7519740	this 30 seconds. And then we can watch the clips if you don't mind. Regarding regarding gate kept
7519740	7525900	voting, I think there are strong arguments for many different systems. But I think they all have
7525900	7533020	the same fatal flaw. And the fatal flaw is, in a social contract society, the point of the
7533020	7539660	government is that it is, it wields the monopoly on force. And that is what makes the government
7539660	7544380	different from a corporation and from an individual, an individual person. It wields
7544380	7548620	a monopoly on force, it is the decider of what justice is, it will be the thing that comes and
7548620	7552460	arrest you if you if you violate a crime, it will be what sticks up for you, if you have been the
7552460	7559420	victim of a crime, it has to be the thing that uses force in ways that no other body can. And so
7559420	7564940	if you are going to be subject to the violence of the government, you should even if you have no
7564940	7570860	money, even if you don't pay enough in taxes or own land or, or serve as a soldier, you should
7570860	7578300	probably have some say in how that force is applied. So if the cops are coming to arrest you,
7578300	7581980	because you broke a law, you probably should have had some opportunity to vote on whether or not
7581980	7587100	that should have been a law. I think that is something that all the other systems kind of
7587100	7594540	disregard. But like, there's, there's something to those systems that can't simply be ignored.
7594540	7597900	Because there's lots of people, it seems to be more on the progressive side of things. They say,
7597900	7602780	like, well, if you want to restrict democracy in any way, that means you're a fascist. And it's
7602780	7606940	like, well, not necessarily, right? Like, clearly, democracy should be restricted to citizens of the
7607180	7611740	nation. And you can't have a bunch of people who aren't citizens voting in your democracy.
7612380	7617260	Like, there's reasonable things. And I even see the appeal of like, intelligence, like, like,
7617260	7622780	are you should like a 65 IQ person be able to vote? You can't even write on the page like,
7622780	7629980	I get it. But I think that the the worst evil is the possibility of government violence being
7629980	7637180	used against somebody who had no conceivable option to even avoid it. And there's my rent.
7639500	7640060	What do you think?
7642540	7649580	What do I think? I think I need to read a lot more political theory before I can offer you good
7649580	7657580	interesting conversation, because it's obvious to me that you have way more knowledge in this space.
7657580	7662140	And so like you, like, you know, when you're talking to somebody who's like,
7662140	7665340	way more trained in a field, and then you ask a question, and then give you that look where you're
7665340	7671260	like, fuck, that question makes no sense within the field. That's it. That's it. That's where
7671260	7677420	I feel where I'm like, interesting guys, I can I have some thoughts about this. I'll fully admit,
7677420	7683900	I'm slightly distracted. Because there's stuff going on privately in my DMS that is like,
7683900	7688540	very distracting. It was the other way around when it was psychology earlier, because I know
7688540	7692060	some I know enough to know what you're saying, but not enough to comment on it. Right. So,
7692620	7701340	like, I understand completely. Yeah. Um, but, yeah, I guess that's something that we could
7702060	7707900	always I mean, I, I, I've enjoyed what we've talked about anyway, you know, it's been fun.
7708620	7712300	But if you want me to stick around and see what you've got going on, I can do that. Sure.
7713260	7718860	I've got maybe I got maybe an hour left of my night. And you can have the hour or we can or
7718860	7725900	I can go do something else. It's up to you. Well, I got it. But I do I do. I do kind of want to see
7726620	7733820	some of the shit show that's happening right now. Okay. Got a clip. Okay. Can you see my stream?
7734700	7741100	I can. You're on Firefox right now. Use Firefox. Yeah. Isn't it Firefox like a memory hog?
7741100	7744620	It's better than Chrome. I use brave man.
7745900	7751420	Using those alt options. Yes, wanting to load me. Oh, it's downloading. That's why
7752220	7754300	I even have a fair phone, believe it or not.
7757100	7762140	Their phone. Is that? Yeah. Do you do programming? Are you one of those nerds who like programs your
7762140	7767980	own phones and stuff? Kind of. So a fair phone is a completely open source phone made in Europe.
7767980	7771660	So it has like it has stuff that both lefties and righties kind of like about it.
7772300	7778060	So it's completely made out of recycled material. I think it's like 75% reticle at least. And also,
7778060	7782540	there's a lot of right to repair stuff because every component of it can be easily dismantled
7782540	7788300	and bought on the fair phone website. So lefties like that because of the the openness of the of
7788300	7792860	the hardware and the recyclability. Righties like it, though, because it also has a bunch of
7793100	7798940	like anti tracking and anti data harvesting components to it as well. So it's basically
7798940	7805980	like that the the best phone if you if you hate big tech and want to be like a Greenpeace advocate.
7805980	7807900	Okay, so I just I got one of those.
7807900	7813580	Look at you living out your ethics like a fucking loser.
7814460	7818860	It cost me extra $200 to for what I otherwise got, but it was important to me. So I got it.
7819820	7821740	Yes. Right. You ready for this?
7823900	7827100	I am watching. Is that Overwatch? Yeah, Overwatch.
7827100	7830780	Yes. I like it. So I don't
7835180	7840940	respect her takes on psychology. Agree. And I feel so.
7840940	7852780	The way that she and Destiny kind of ganged up on Max was really irritating.
7852780	7857820	They do this with every fucking orbiter because not so erudite has to signal to
7857820	7861900	Destiny that she's still the best one. It's like a golden child syndrome.
7863340	7867900	Jesus. And it comes from a deep
7867900	7870700	insecurity of not knowing when it's going to happen a lot.
7873100	7874220	Yeah. Oh my god.
7874220	7878460	What do you think about that? So from what I understand,
7878460	7883420	as somebody in the space for two since 2009, you are deeply familiar with petty drama on
7883420	7888780	the internet, probably more than I am. So I would love to know your analysis of this clip.
7889820	7892780	So from what I understand, Destiny is kind of unique on YouTube.
7893740	7896620	He's kind of unique on YouTube in such a way that
7897740	7902540	right now there's the orbiter meta of DGG, right? Where there's a bunch of people coming on,
7902540	7906300	and they're all kind of jockeying for the attention of Destiny and his viewers,
7906300	7910300	while Destiny sits there and plays Factorio and gets completely absorbed by League of Legends.
7910940	7917100	So that's the current DGG meta. And from what I can tell, it's actually kind of unique.
7918060	7922540	There are other components of the internet that have like a big central YouTuber and
7923100	7927820	their smaller friends. So I'm part of the Sargon orbit. You know who Sargon is, right?
7927820	7928320	Yep. Yep.
7928940	7933260	Okay, so there's the Sargon orbit. He's more right-leaning than me, but we've been friends
7933260	7937260	for like five years. And we have a lot of spirited debates, actually, in private, because I don't
7937260	7942540	agree with him on a lot. But we're good friends. And there's like V is in there, and Archwarhammer
7942540	7947100	is in there, and I'm in there, and Rags and Mauler, the EFAP guys, they're in there. Adam
7947100	7951740	and Sitch, you went on their show recently, they're in there. There's like a group of us,
7951740	7956700	and we're all kind of like pals, and we all talk about stuff. And we all tend to orbit around
7956700	7965180	Sargon because Sargon has nearly a million subs. And we do kind of owe partially our success to
7965180	7969340	him, but it's not as drastic as with Destiny, because Destiny has like made people's careers.
7969340	7975580	Destiny made Vaush. Destiny has made Mr. Girl. He's kind of made you, in a sense,
7975580	7979660	if you don't mind me saying. Oh, for sure. Absolutely. I wouldn't even cope about that.
7980460	7986780	Um, and for me, like Sargon definitely made me for sure. He gave me like one third of my sub base with
7986780	7992780	a shout out at one point. But Sargon didn't really make V. Sargon helped, but V kind of made himself
7992780	7998460	and Arch definitely made himself and Adam and Sitch kind of made themselves. So we, Destiny is
7998460	8003660	unique in that like, the orbiters seem to really depend on them way more than in other YouTube
8003660	8009820	spaces. And I feel like that that dynamic might actually lead to more orbiter infighting. People
8009820	8013260	who are really like, I gotta get on Destiny stream today, I gotta get I gotta get those subs, man,
8013260	8017660	I gotta get that money. I gotta get those views. And they kind of see destiny as a path forward.
8017660	8022060	And combine that with the fact that Destiny has had a lot of bridge burning over the years.
8022940	8026940	Like, there was like the bridge burn with Vaush. And then there was, there was the bridge burn with
8026940	8031580	Xander hall, the bridge burn with the surfs, all the lefties, he burned all the lefty bridges.
8031580	8034700	And then like, I think even with Nick Fuentes, there's been like a bridge burn.
8034700	8039500	Yeah. I'm not sure if they're not doing anything together in the last one.
8039500	8043500	Yeah. So and I haven't seen him do anything with Lauren Southern recently, either. But
8043500	8047740	maybe that's burned me. I don't know. I'm not even I'm not like, I don't know destiny. I've
8047740	8053340	talked to him in DMS a couple times. And I actually wanted to stream once like late night,
8053340	8058060	like a year and a half ago. And I had just started watching him. And I got so like,
8058060	8061580	nervous. I couldn't talk to him. And I made myself sound like a complete fucking retard.
8061580	8064780	And I was like, Please don't upload this VOD. And he's like, Don't worry, I won't understand.
8065900	8068620	But I haven't had a chance to talk to him again since then. And he's kind of hard to get a hold
8068620	8075580	of. I'd like to but um, I don't know if I have anything relevant to say on anything. But um,
8077020	8083020	I do know that a lot of I'm not I'm not in his head. But so from the outside, it seems like
8083020	8087980	there's a lot of bridge burning happening. A lot of like, kind of people are using him,
8088540	8092540	blowing up their platforms, like book smarts and burning the bridge and then
8093100	8098540	running away with now that they've had a career that's gotten jump started. And when I this just
8098540	8105020	seems to be like another case of that, when I see this, and maybe that maybe these people
8105020	8108300	shit talking you is going to be a component of that, because you seem like one of the
8108300	8113900	people who wouldn't do that to destiny. So maybe that's what's going on here. That that
8113900	8118700	kind of seems like what's happening. Like I don't, I don't know who these two people are
8118700	8120060	that are talking but just from the
8120060	8121420	It's Anna and
8122300	8122540	Lav.
8123900	8125180	Who who are these two people?
8125180	8125740	Ann of War?
8127580	8135820	Oh, Anna. Okay. Okay. Yes. Oh, God. The person that you cannot speak about in DGG. I know who
8135820	8139580	that is. It's tricky, right? There's multiple reasons why you shouldn't speak about it. Like
8139580	8145660	she did get like a aggressive level of like, hatred that like, really distressed her as well.
8145660	8150620	Not saying that she was perfect in the whole thing. But yeah. Yeah, I know. I know the basic
8150620	8154940	story that I know there's some some weirdness. The other person though, I, I think I've seen
8154940	8158380	her on a few of destiny streams, but I don't know what her deal is. I haven't. I don't know that.
8158380	8163900	I'm sorry. But it does seem like from an outsider's point of view, this is like the orbiter jockeying
8163900	8168540	meta right now. That I think is just a continuation of what we've seen before.
8168540	8171580	So I have one more thing to share you. And then I would like to
8171580	8174060	watch a bit of a live stream with you if that's okay.
8174860	8175580	Sure thing.
8175580	8180700	Okay. Face takes. See, I told you, I knew that you think well,
8181260	8182940	okay, share your screen. Sorry.
8182940	8183580	Well, thank you very much.
8184460	8186220	You're so
8186220	8193740	I've like, I've seen when I had that kind of big blow up where like, I just failed at a school.
8193900	8198060	Part of my, I guess the reconstitution of myself, I was trying to be like, well,
8198060	8201180	what did I do wrong here? And a lot of it was that I felt like
8202060	8206540	I was just I was getting by on, like a natural intelligence that had basically run out,
8206540	8210220	I hit my wall. And so I need to, I need to try and think differently. And a lot of that was like,
8210220	8214940	well, maybe let's be a bit more rational. Let's get a little bit more in touch with like my intuition.
8214940	8221900	I've been trying to do some, some almost like you do ski and mental exercises, if that makes sense.
8222780	8226540	Okay, you ready? I'm gonna I can't speed it up. No, you're good. You're good. You're good.
8227420	8228620	I can't see it. I just see your face.
8230300	8233020	I'm sharing screen in the discord. You see it?
8233020	8235420	Yeah, I can't see the discord. It's just your avatar.
8236140	8239500	Oh, that's really weird. Um, let me try.
8239500	8240780	It's in your screenshot if you want to see.
8240780	8242140	No, I believe. Is that better?
8243420	8250620	No. Nope. Here. It's actually a type of glitch that I haven't seen before. So it's kind of
8250860	8251740	new to me.
8251740	8252620	Can you see this one?
8255100	8256060	Say I'm nuclear?
8256860	8257980	No, nothing's changing.
8259020	8262300	I'm just gonna turn this off.
8262300	8263660	Can it be a refresh of it?
8265980	8273340	Nope. Still no. Here. What if I leave the call and come back?
8273340	8281180	Okay, there we go. It's back. Sorry about that.
8281820	8287100	Okay. Can you see it? Is it working? Okay. Can you hear it?
8287100	8289420	Eyes. How do I hear it?
8289420	8295580	And I'm not saying that there was any. It's hard. It's hard to grapple with because there's no
8303980	8310060	I mean, I reached out to Steven first, right? I reached out to Steven because I
8311900	8317740	liked his content. And I assume that like most of the women also did, right?
8318460	8321820	So then I have to think about like, did I put myself in a situation like this?
8321820	8328780	And the answer is yes. And I can also take myself out of it if I feel uncomfortable.
8330220	8331100	And that's what I'm doing.
8332060	8335820	Do I think that Steven is an evil person? No.
8337100	8341260	At this point, not enough information has come out to make me feel like he's an evil person.
8343420	8351020	I wasn't metude. I wasn't, I wasn't harassed. Everything was consensual.
8351020	8354300	And I'm sure most of the things that he's done with women are consensual, right?
8355260	8361580	But now there lies this strange intersection between what is consensual and then
8363420	8369100	all these women that are orbiting him that are fighting each other in front of him
8369900	8375340	for his honor, who have had sex with him or had a sexual relationship with him.
8377580	8379020	That is kind of GigaChat, I guess.
8380620	8382140	And it feels weird.
8382220	8388060	I don't know if that's true. I don't know if that's true. Like I, I don't have a sexual
8388060	8394220	relationship with him at all. It's super platonic. I'm sure it's true for a lot, but he's in an open
8394220	8400540	relationship. He's got a decently, any girl that's attracted to intellectuality is going to be
8400540	8403580	someone into him. He's pretty charismatic. Yeah.
8403580	8409260	It's charismatic. He's good with women and he likes to fuck. So it's like, I'm not surprised
8409260	8412380	that he fucks a lot of the women that come on the stream, but I don't know if it's true that there's
8412380	8416940	like this, like it's making it, it's making it seem like there's a necessary requirement that
8416940	8423020	a woman is like sexual to be part of the orbit, which is not true. Um, I believe for example,
8423020	8427020	isn't like Pixie who's still part of the orbit talks to him like dating and therefore like,
8427740	8434780	assumably not involved. Um, I don't know. I do know. I've, I've, I've talked to Pixie a bit in
8434780	8438620	DGG. I don't know if she's dating anybody. Um, I do know, I think this is public knowledge,
8438620	8442940	so I don't mind saying it. Um, I've talked to Cherry a bunch and apparently they had some
8442940	8447260	kind of a fling, but I think that's public knowledge. In fact, I'm almost 90% certain
8447260	8454140	that's public knowledge. Um, if they had a fling at one point, um, I know Stardust orbits,
8454140	8459820	but Stardust isn't as in a relationship. She's got a boyfriend. Um, I think maybe,
8462300	8468220	Hmm. Don't take this the wrong way. All right. I think maybe the reason people are assuming that
8468220	8472780	you have been sexual with him is because you visited him and it's very easy to say
8473820	8478460	who's going to go and visit a streamer and not do that sort of thing when the camera's off.
8478460	8481500	But my husband was there and his wife is there the whole time.
8482220	8484700	Well, sure, sure. But he has an open relationship, right? And I mean,
8484700	8488220	maybe everyone's assuming that you guys all had a foursome or something. I don't know.
8488220	8492140	Like if I were somebody who knew absolutely nothing watching from the outside, just being
8492140	8496460	a fan of everyone, I could see that being a fan theory that kind of propagated around.
8496460	8501660	For sure. I totally understand why that would be a fan theory. And it's like, obviously,
8501660	8506220	if I say that I haven't, some people will just take me at my word. Other people are going to
8506220	8509260	think I'm coping and lying about it. Right. And it's just like, there's, and there's no way,
8509260	8514060	like, what the fuck do I do to prove it? Because you're proving a negative, right?
8514060	8519020	Yeah, exactly. Exactly. All right. Wondering if there's more of this.
8519020	8524700	Because, because how do you consent to something like that? Like, how do I,
8525340	8528700	how do I consent to having a sexual relationship with someone and then
8529980	8538220	for them to let me get completely denigrated on a subreddit or in the chat every time I come on and
8538220	8550060	then how, how does that, like with Britney or Terry or with all of those, like, how do we,
8551260	8558220	what is that situation? How do you navigate that situation? It's so strange.
8558220	8565340	It's weird. It's like.
8567340	8568300	I have a question about that.
8568300	8570140	And I would not tell my.
8571900	8577980	Is this her confirming for the first time that her and Destiny have had a sexual relationship?
8577980	8580700	Or is that, is this also known about this person?
8580700	8585180	I'm not going to be asked. I don't know. I don't follow like all of the drama super closely.
8585980	8586940	Okay. Okay.
8586940	8589740	So probably chat will answer that better than I can.
8590620	8591420	All right. Okay.
8592780	8598220	Friend to put themselves in that situation or to continue that situation. So I had to
8598220	8601580	be a good friend to myself and take myself out of it.
8608140	8613500	Which I think is fine. Like I said, I don't, I don't think Steven is a bad person.
8613500	8615020	Do I think he's impulsive? Sure.
8616940	8622860	I really, what I'm saying is selfishly, the situation was not good for me.
8626860	8630220	It can be good even for other women if they're getting what they want out of it, I suppose.
8630780	8634700	To her credit, it probably isn't good for her. If she's, if she feels like she's existing in
8634700	8639500	an ecosystem where she's had sex with a guy and she's now surrounded by like his harem
8639500	8642620	and everyone believes that they're all fucking and they're all fighting
8642620	8646060	each other while he just kind of sits there, you know, half paying attention.
8646060	8649100	It probably isn't good for her. If that's how she perceives the situation.
8649820	8652540	I would agree. She's also like, is getting a massive, massive,
8652540	8655340	massive amount of hate from DGG. The issue is that it's like,
8661020	8664700	I don't, I don't want to say that somebody has like earned it necessarily because I think
8664700	8668220	most of the hate that people get online is disproportionate. And I think misogyny
8668220	8672940	makes almost all of the hatred against women typically beyond overblown, right? Like,
8672940	8679820	um, yeah, there's just, there's just a much smaller margin of error for women to exist within,
8680460	8685100	which is a really big problem. Yeah.
8685100	8688060	The issue is she's also like said a lot of shit where I'm like,
8689660	8694300	probably be careful about how you say this publicly. And like, to what, like,
8694300	8700380	there's an expectation of like, you need to protect me from like your community being mean to me. But
8702940	8711820	she's, um, why she's very young, right? Like she seems she looks kind of young 24. Okay.
8713100	8716860	I mean, she's not that young, I guess not that young, but I would say she's definitely young
8716860	8721100	in like the way that she engages in like the world and stuff like that. For sure. Like,
8721100	8727420	I can kind of see that from how she talks. Yeah. Yeah. Um, like by 24, that already been passed
8727420	8731020	like my own life collapse. I was already kind of growing up at that point. But this this reminds
8731020	8736380	me of like, like a female version of me when I was like 20. You know, like, kind of being a
8736380	8740860	bit oblivious about some things and wanting other people to take to take responsibility for stuff
8740860	8747660	that I probably had at least half of a hand in, if that makes sense. And it's not like the,
8748540	8751980	the hyper individualistic view of just take responsibility for everything. It's all your
8751980	8755340	fault. Like that doesn't really help either. But there's probably some middle ground between
8756140	8758700	it's all my fault. And it's all somebody else's fault, you know,
8758700	8767820	the issue is like, you don't, you don't get to say this shit. Like you don't have to play the
8767820	8773260	stupid, like politically correct game, but she doesn't get to like, have an out for just acting
8773260	8777020	young. Like this is the issue, like with sneaker too, like I'll give grace to sneaker, but he's
8777020	8781980	still culpable. Like people not liking sneaker and like attacking him is also part of it. Like
8781980	8785580	if you're going to act immature and you're going to say dumb ass shit all the time, the realities
8785580	8789580	that there are consequences for those actions. And yes, when you're in public scrutiny,
8789580	8792940	those consequences are way bigger than they probably even should be. They're way
8792940	8797420	disproportionate reactions, which fucking sucks. But that's why the reality is that being in the
8797420	8803260	public eye is not for everyone, which is super fucking fair. It's awful. It's awful. And it's
8803260	8808220	wrong what a lot of people have to deal with in the public space, but it isn't destiny's fault
8808220	8812380	that this is existing. And it's just crazy to me that she's saying shit like this when she
8812380	8817180	literally just attacked cherry and stardust for like in her mind, me towing Max, when it's like,
8817740	8821740	what are the implications of what you're saying here? Like, what are like, think about it. You
8821740	8825660	don't get the out of being like, I'm young. I get to walk up. Like, it's like, think about what the
8825660	8829980	fuck you're saying here. This is really bad. This is really, really bad. What you're implying here.
8830940	8836380	Just to clarify what you're talking about was the, um, the midriff exposure drama, right? Yeah.
8837180	8841260	Okay. No, I understand what you're talking about. Okay. Um, yeah, that sounds, it sounds like a lot
8841260	8847820	of it. Um, the issue is, from what I think, I think the issue is, I think the issue is,
8848780	8855260	it's something like, everyone kind of goes through this process as part of their own maturity,
8856060	8859980	where they, they like, they say some dumb shit, because they're kind of stupid.
8859980	8863420	Do they make like veiled? I don't know if I've ever made veiled accusations at like,
8863420	8869820	essentially, like, some sort of like power abuse of a sexual dynamic thing. Okay. Somebody who
8869820	8874140	is my friend, especially publicly, right? Like, like, he's been good to her. They,
8874140	8878540	I assume that they're friends. They seem friendly. At least, um, he's been exceedingly
8878540	8882540	charitable of her, like some of her, like really bad positions. And he's been like, patient with
8882540	8890060	her. Like this isn't, this isn't like a normal growing up stuff. It's like, this is worse than
8890060	8894620	that because I've never done this. Not even publicly. The worst I ever did even close to
8894620	8898940	that was like one time in grade eight, I told my friend that my friend had a crush on her brother.
8898940	8902700	And she told me that I shouldn't and like asked me not to, which was bad. I broke my promise.
8902700	8907340	That was bad. But that's like, I'm pretty sure that's the last time I ever like fucking crossed
8907340	8913260	that boundary because I was like, Oh my God, this is so bad. Like this is, yeah.
8913260	8917420	Oh yeah. That first time when like you tell a lie that goes way out of proportion,
8917420	8921020	reality snaps back. You're fucking terrified when it happens. Holy shit.
8921820	8926620	Like the idea that destiny giving these people a platform makes them more responsible is actually
8926620	8934540	kind of psychotic to me. So, so I was going to get to that. I was, I was trying to be fair to her
8934540	8938140	before I got to that part of the conversation. I'm sorry. I'm just, I know I'm going, I'm being
8938140	8941420	bummed out. I was trying to be, I was trying to dump on your charitable train too, but then I'm
8941420	8945260	just like starting to think about the implications and I'm like, what the fuck? Like, what the fuck?
8946700	8952700	So, um, let's see if this process were happening to this exact same person,
8953340	8960300	but one, it was offline and two, it were with somebody who let's say didn't have an audience
8960300	8963500	and it was just somebody she had been sleeping with. And there had been a little bit of
8963500	8969660	interpersonal drama in their friend group. It probably would not be nearly this bad. I think,
8970300	8975500	I think a lot of it is just exacerbation through the fact that there's like 10,000 people watching
8975500	8981340	this drama right now. And that's still ultimately her fault because she did some of this stuff and
8981420	8986060	she's allowing her responses to get exacerbated by the fact that she has a spotlight shining on
8986060	8995900	her right now. But it's, it's high. It's like 10% understandable, I guess. And 90%, what the fuck
8995900	9005740	are you doing? Yeah, because it's still, because even if you can understand, even if you can put
9005740	9011820	yourself in her shoes and kind of try to model her brain and it's like, well, what would you do
9011820	9016140	if you were her? And it might be something similar. I mean, from the outside, it still
9016140	9022460	looks kind of crazy, right? It's still like, you know, if this, this is a streamer who destiny has
9022460	9026220	collaborated with and has probably grown her stream off of, and it sounds like they've,
9026220	9030780	they've had sex. And now that after she's kind of, you know, she's gotten her bag,
9031420	9035420	she's here kind of turning on the whole thing, and not only turning on the whole thing,
9035980	9042460	but like, not making any sort of actual threat of any sort of like sexual misconduct, but like,
9042460	9046460	vague posting about it. Yeah, yeah. She's scraping at the edges of it a little bit.
9047340	9052620	And, and it's like, well, maybe I can get like one last, one last bag out of out of DGG before
9052620	9056940	I finally burned the bridge completely by by having this new. And it's like that seems kind
9056940	9062700	of scummy. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, destiny is now live fighting with Max because I guess
9062700	9068540	this is escalated. Would you like to stay and watch this with me? Sure. Of course, again,
9068540	9075420	in DGG politics is just getting derailed by by DGG drama. Oh, my God, there was that one
9075420	9079580	recently he was going to have a guy on to talk about the midterms and it got instantly fucking
9079580	9085980	derailed by a bunch of people jumping in and talking about I know I know the black experience
9085980	9089420	or something and no offense to that conversation, but I wanted to watch politics.
9089420	9092860	Yeah, one thing I will say for love, because a lot of people don't actually know this about her,
9092860	9099180	she is actually quite successful in multiple platforms. So she's got about 700k on TikTok,
9099180	9103500	I think. And she's written a number of like decently successful Spotify songs as well.
9103500	9108540	So the dynamic of like relying on him for her platform isn't as true. In fact, I think she's
9108540	9114060	helped him go viral on TikTok multiple times. So their relationship actually is a little bit
9114380	9119660	at least in platform, helping a little bit actually more equitable than like mine would
9119660	9124940	be, for example. Just to make sure that that's known, because there's another there's another
9124940	9130060	dynamic in there. You can't make you can't really make money on TikTok. And I don't know what
9130060	9133820	Spotify but you can't make money on TikTok the way you can on Twitch and YouTube. So there might be
9133820	9138620	an added financial component because it's very hard to move your your audience between platforms.
9138620	9145100	You know, if you have a million sub TikTok, you might have like a 70,000 sub YouTube, right? So
9145820	9152780	if you have a platform that just isn't monetizable, it doesn't in terms of like how much
9152780	9156940	money you're making it matters a whole lot less, you know. So there might still be that financial
9156940	9163020	incentive here. Yeah, possibly. I thought on TikTok after you have 100k subs, you can start making
9163020	9166940	dollars per view as well. That was my understanding. But maybe I'm wrong.
9166940	9171500	And there's, um, there is a pretty big TikToker with several million
9172700	9177580	called call me Chris. She's out in Vancouver, actually. And she revealed recently that she
9177580	9182940	makes nothing on TikTok. Zero, not a single cent. And it's like, holy shit.
9182940	9187900	So I'm glad I moved off that site. Holy shit. It's so scummy. That's crazy.
9189580	9196060	Okay, well, if you'd like to hear the screaming, I'm having fun. Okay. So your insight says like
9196620	9199580	outsider because you're like, you're not really in the orbit, right? So you're like,
9199580	9203820	kind of like an outsider viewing from within is really interesting. Can you see this?
9203820	9208060	I know a lot. I can. Yeah, I know a lot of the people like I know. I know who Destiny is. And
9208060	9212620	I know who you are. I know taftaj is, you know, I know who Stardust is, but I'm not in the circle,
9212620	9221900	you know, circle. I know. Um, there was shit, there's something I want to say. And I don't
9221900	9226220	remember what it is. It's gone. Left my head. She gone. Are you good? If I watch it 1.5,
9226220	9231100	I tend to watch. Oh, sure. I can watch it 2.2. If you want. My chat usually loses their shit.
9231100	9236620	If I watch that too. I have actually a thing downloaded so I can watch it at three. But I
9236620	9240060	find if I'm watching it at three times speed, I have to actually watch it and not just have
9240060	9243660	it on in the background. I can do three, but I have to really be focused on it.
9243660	9250300	Yeah. Yeah, me too. I Yeah. And I usually try to passively consume content. Same. Yeah. Yeah.
9250300	9254060	Okay. Ready? Ready. Should we go from the beginning?
9255900	9261100	How? Oh, 30 minutes. Okay. Sure. Sure. There's a 30 minute section where there's nothing happening.
9261100	9267340	Okay. Right. Have all my sources, my links, my docs. I usually take time to like get everything
9267340	9271020	in a row. Have all my sources, my links, my docs, my manifest. Just tell me if you want to pause it.
9271820	9276380	A little bit. For reasons that will become apparent. And I don't think this one is quite
9276380	9279820	crank it to max in mind. Can you crank up a little bit as it's coming through to me?
9279820	9283580	Because it's kind of quiet. Sure. Let me try doing this.
9287580	9290300	Is that is that better? It's like the same.
9291580	9296060	Nope, it's good now. That's okay. Okay. We're gonna we're gonna wing it.
9297260	9301100	A new manifest doesn't work. Come back into a formal write up. I guess
9301100	9304700	live and impromptu improv manifesto.
9311580	9313980	I like his new emote, the skull emote, the nah.
9316380	9322620	Should I should I smoke a little bit? Or should I just fucking go trying to try to think? Actually,
9322620	9327180	you know what? Before we do this, let me see how this is gonna go. Let's see how this is gonna go.
9327180	9330540	Hold on. If I get over 900, I've got to go to the washroom, but I have wireless headphones.
9331420	9334540	Are you fucking kidding me? I'm gonna keep listening. Don't worry about it.
9334540	9335900	I'll be back in a minute. Okay. Okay.
9344940	9346300	Okay, this.
9349980	9356700	This situation actually really sucks. Generally, we're gonna go back. Let me take you back a few
9356700	9361980	months. Generally, when I meet people online, there is very limited interaction that I have
9361980	9366140	at such a level to where I can cut a person off. I wouldn't care. It's incredibly rare. It's like
9366140	9372700	three people in my life would affect me. But after a few months ago, after a few months ago,
9372700	9376620	I had a tumultuous interpersonal thing that happened. And I was like, okay, well,
9376620	9380060	here's like a lesson I think that I've learned from myself. I'm gonna reach out and talk to
9380060	9385260	more people offline to try to have more like human friendly ish type relationships. Because
9385260	9390620	that's what like, um, that's what human beings do. Maybe be good for me. And one of those people
9391420	9397420	was our good friend Max. And another one of those people before she became a streamer was lab.
9398620	9400780	So with her, like a few months ago, she wasn't really into the whole
9401500	9401980	destiny.
9404140	9407900	Oh, yeah. I'll make it smaller. Yeah.
9409740	9410860	Oh, yeah. Did that work?
9414860	9417500	Well, not really, but they've eased up on destiny at themes.
9417500	9420140	Oh, streaming thing. So I didn't really think much of it. It's like, oh,
9420140	9427260	random person I've spoken to before, whatever. And, uh, yeah. Yikes. So
9430780	9436860	where do we even begin? What happened?
9439740	9443500	Am I crazy to think that love has hope? So here's, here's the issue.
9444540	9448220	I don't have perfect transparency. Okay. I don't normally make, so here's something that I've
9448220	9451740	learned in my life. Okay. One of the reasons why I think I'm quite intelligent and quite good at
9451740	9454700	dealing with people generally, because I'm usually pretty humble about the extent of my knowledge on
9454700	9457820	a person. So like, I might say, or think that I have a person like 90% figured out, but I'll
9457820	9460540	really only act on like 50% because like, truly, you don't know, like, I'm not going to sit here
9460540	9463580	like, oh, I mind read you completely. I figured you out 100% blah, blah, blah. Usually I get an
9463580	9465980	inkling, I'll ask more questions, interact with somebody more. If somebody would ever ask me,
9465980	9468460	and I've said this a lot on stream before, somebody asked me, how well, how do you know
9468460	9470940	if you truly know a person? How long do you need? Like, I can do it in 10 minutes. And some people
9470940	9474220	do it in hours. Usually I say, well, if I've gone through like a really big situation with somebody
9474220	9476220	and they could have fucked me over, then I'll know what that person's like. That's generally
9476220	9478700	like my approach. I usually wait to see until big situations happen. And then I kind of get like a
9478700	9485020	handle on, on what people truly are like. So that being said, generally when I'm like reading people
9485020	9488460	on stream, I'm usually pretty reserved in what I'm saying. I usually don't give like all of my
9490620	9495900	just because I don't know 100% and because it's whatever, but I'm going to be a little
9495900	9500860	bit more candid with my impressions now. I don't actually think that Lav or Anna or
9500860	9505340	Shaylin are that much in the wrong. I think that max is actually like a full-on narcissistic
9505340	9509340	manipulator. Who's abusive to every single person in his orbit, probably worse than any other person
9509340	9514060	I've ever seen in my entire life. I kind of got that inkling over the Shaylin videos, but
9514060	9516700	truthfully, I'm willing to extend like, well, maybe there's stuff I'm not seeing. Maybe there's
9516700	9519020	something I don't understand. Yeah. You know, like maybe there's something going on behind the scenes
9519020	9524620	or whatever. Um, so I'm like willing to wait for data to come in, but especially watching him
9524620	9529180	interact with Lav on his stream and then seeing how Lav has changed her disposition and then seeing
9529180	9532220	the types of messages that Anna sends me now, and then hearing about what Shaylin is saying
9532220	9536620	on the logic stream. Now I understand way more like what's. Can I jump in here a bit? Yeah,
9536620	9542780	for sure. So two things. Um, one while you've been doing this,
9543500	9550620	Chad logic has been doing the Shaylin interview and, uh, I messaged him and I was like,
9551260	9554780	I watched the VOD later cause I'm going to do something, but what's been going on in the
9554780	9558540	Shaylin interview. And he says, apparently some spicy things have happened in the Shaylin interview.
9558540	9567500	So, okay. There's a lot of, uh, shit stirring. I suspect we're about to see a massive civil
9567500	9576620	war and separation of certain orbiters probably. No, no orbiter will be, will be left. Everyone
9576620	9582780	must, everyone must take all we'll be victims of the great civil war. Uh, even, even started us
9582780	9586780	assuming about it. Now she switched over from election coverage to destiny, Mr. Girl. Yeah.
9588300	9591820	Max has a certain impression. He's able to, the second thing I wanted to point out. No,
9591820	9594220	for sure. The second thing is, um,
9597420	9603740	there's probably some psych way to describe this that I don't, I don't know, but I think there's
9603740	9610220	like, I don't want to word this. I haven't, I haven't vocalized this idea before. It's only
9610220	9618060	been in my head. So I'm trying to figure out, um, when you see somebody do something,
9618700	9626780	it's actually not important what you're seeing. What's important is what state of mind that
9626780	9634140	they're likely to have while they're doing it. Does that make sense? Explain it. It's like,
9635260	9642540	um, okay. Let's, let's see. If I told you that I had a girlfriend whose name was Naomi,
9642540	9647740	was Naomi. There's a few things that I could be doing when I, when I do this,
9647740	9653660	I could be saying to you, I have a girlfriend named Naomi. And in reality, I actually have
9653660	9659980	a girlfriend named Naomi, or I could be lying to you. I could be saying, I could be saying,
9659980	9664780	I want you to think for some ulterior motive reason that I have a girlfriend named Naomi,
9664780	9671900	but I don't actually, and it's going to depend how you take what I'm saying to you is going to
9671900	9678860	depend on how likely you think either of those, um, mind States that I have is.
9681340	9688140	Okay. Okay. So I've, I've seen a bunch of Max's stuff and I actually, um,
9688140	9694700	messaged him to interview him. Uh, but he never, he never got back to me. Um, because he reminded
9694700	9700300	me of me when I was 19, I see a lot of similarities between him and I, before I went through my
9700300	9707100	complete like life ruination. Um, and I was like, this is very interesting because I see a lot of,
9707100	9712380	like, you know, I wasn't, there were some bad components of myself that I think I've at least
9712380	9716620	kind of tamed as I've gotten older and I see them in him and I'm like, I want to talk to this guy.
9716620	9722540	Right. Um, which never happened, but I have been watching his stuff. And when Destiny says,
9722540	9728380	I think Max is like a, you know, as I call it, a psychotic manipulator of the highest degree,
9728860	9733260	you know, as soon as he said that I was, I was in the washroom, but as soon as he said that I was
9733260	9737740	like, I had these flashes in my mind of like certain things, nothing concrete that I can
9737740	9742140	think of right, right on right now. But I had flashes of like certain things he had said,
9742140	9748460	certain feelings that I had towards him where it's like, it could be the case that you're telling the
9748460	9755500	truth, but if you were lying about this thing, it's actually highly probable that this is what
9755500	9760780	you would say. This is the lie you would tell if you were lying, if that makes sense.
9760780	9765340	Well, yeah, it's the issue of like, it's like the kind of like, it's almost in a way like the body
9765340	9768940	language analysis where it's like the exact thing that you would express if you wanted to convince
9768940	9774220	people that you weren't being deceptive might also look identical to non deceptive behavior.
9775580	9781740	Yes, yes. I was trying to, I, I kind of brush at the surface of this when I was talking to
9781740	9786300	Stardust, but it wasn't really the conversation. So I didn't get into it. I said, I vocalize
9786300	9794620	something like, um, deception versus intuition. Ultimately deception wins because a perfect
9795180	9800940	deceptor will look completely identical to the real thing to a perfect intuitionist.
9800940	9805180	Well, there's another factor in here, which is the self-deceptor, right? There's somebody who knows
9805180	9809580	that they're lying and who will try to like maintain a certain look and the perfect
9809580	9815180	intentional deceptor. You can't tell from that, but there are also another category, which is the
9815180	9819900	self-deceptors. So they don't realize that they've lied to themselves. So they're living under the
9819900	9825900	lie, like the intentional liar, but they believe the lie to be true. And so they're also typically
9825900	9829900	going to look just like authenticity because they are authentically reacting to the situation.
9829900	9833500	The problem is that they have misconstrued it. This is the most common cause of fights,
9833500	9838460	for example, right? You miscommunicate, you misunderstand what a person's trying to say.
9838460	9842540	And so you take it in one way when it was intended in a different way. And now you have all sorts of
9842540	9845980	feelings and thoughts and emotions when actually all your feelings, thoughts, emotions, and
9845980	9850300	criticisms of the other person are based on like essentially like a self-deception because you've
9850300	9857100	misunderstood what went on. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess that that's like the other possibility
9857100	9861420	where you misunderstand. Right. No, I think I understand what you're saying because what I
9861420	9866140	was talking about is if they're actively trying to deceive you. Yeah. Right. When they're actively
9866220	9872700	trying to like when I when I listen to Max talk. It's it seems like the stuff he is saying
9873740	9878060	is the stuff that you would say if you were lying and actually meant the opposite.
9879260	9882220	But it also could still be true, like that's the problem with it, right? It's
9883820	9885500	I'm having a hard time putting this in words. I don't.
9887340	9894140	It's it's something like. What makes a certain behavior important isn't what the behavior
9894140	9899660	looks like. It's what states of mind that make that make that behavior more or less probable.
9899660	9903180	It's something like that. I'm sorry. This is the kind of the edge of my understanding right now.
9903180	9905980	And so when you're looking at Max, are you basically trying to understand
9905980	9910300	like the state of mind to basically make a proper interpretation of the behavior?
9911820	9920300	Yeah. So when I see Max, a lot of the things he says are things that you would say if you were
9920300	9925340	lying or being deceptive and you wanted to come off as not looking like you're lying or being
9925340	9931260	deceptive. Right. And that that seems to be like his bread and butter almost. I see that in like
9931260	9934780	every stream he's on every video he's on those at least one moment where I'm like,
9934780	9940380	oh, this is one of these, you know? Yeah. And just seems to be like a component,
9940380	9944220	like a core, almost a core component of his personality, at least his online personality.
9944220	9947900	Anyway, yeah, I've really struggled with Max constantly because I waffle between
9947900	9952220	are you self-deceptive or intentionally deceptive? Because you're one of these two things. I don't
9952220	9957420	know which it is. And you don't think you ever think he's actually telling the truth or.
9958700	9962380	I think if you're telling the truth, but your truth is based on a false perception
9962380	9965900	and a small amount of introspection could correct that false perception,
9965900	9969420	it's functionally a lie as well. Yeah, fair enough. Yeah.
9971580	9973740	I do actually have a girlfriend in Naomi, by the way, just for the record.
9974620	9976940	That wasn't that is true. OK, guys, that is true.
9978700	9980620	But then again, if I want you to think that's what I would say.
9982620	9986860	Yeah, and the issue is that like Max has a continued repeated pattern
9986860	9991820	of building a feeling some way about somebody typically upset her angry toward them for
9991820	9998140	whatever reason. And he goes resentful and bitter toward them, like I don't think he's just angry.
9998140	10002700	I think he's like resentful, maybe even hateful. I can't read that much, but he for sure has
10002700	10009180	strong negative emotions toward them. And all of a sudden he can't go. These are just my feelings.
10009180	10013100	This person's fucked up. Margin of error. Humans exist within some element margin of error.
10013820	10020620	It somehow becomes this person must be evil, malicious and wrong. And then he goes out of
10020620	10025900	his way to make a moral crusade. So now this isn't actually about his feelings. His feelings were an
10025900	10030540	intuition that told him something about the person's character and what he's deduced based
10030540	10036220	on his feelings originally is that this person is evil, malicious and wrong. And then he goes on
10036220	10043260	a moral crusade that he paints as some greater reaching good, which is what he did with the Dr.
10043260	10048620	K. I am concerned about psych ethics and the treatment of this psychiatrist, the people who
10048620	10053180	come out on a stream. But it was never about psych ethics because he said from the very beginning
10053180	10058860	with me that if the board did not decide in his favor, which it looks like they will not do,
10059420	10064300	he would basically take it up and attack the board next because there was no way for him to possibly
10064300	10069420	be wrong about his deductions about psych ethics, which means it's not about psych ethics. It's
10069420	10074060	about your feelings and you've just made a moral vendetta out of it. And he did this with Britney.
10074620	10079740	And it sounds like he's doing it again with destiny. And the problem is in this case,
10079740	10084700	destiny is a close friend who actually relied on him and got vulnerable with him, which is like
10084780	10087260	literally the thing Max has said destiny is worst at.
10088700	10095260	I see. Um, well, in terms of the psych ethics thing, like is, is Mr. Girl like involved in
10095260	10100220	the psych sphere enough to know, to know what constitutes bad ethics?
10100220	10104700	His dad and his grandpa are psychologists. And I've heard mixed reports. Some people have told
10104700	10109260	me that he has a degree in psychology, but then when you look up like past articles on him,
10109260	10113740	they report him as having a degree in gender studies. So I'm not sure maybe he's got a major
10113740	10119020	and minor and I don't know which are which. Well, to be fair, my minors in gender studies,
10119020	10125580	so my degree is even more useless. So but, um, okay, let's see here. Um,
10130380	10133980	there's something I had again, and I also lost it. I feel like my memory is going in my old age.
10135180	10139340	Oh, man. Should we keep going? See if it comes back? Or chats?
10139420	10140620	Sure. Go ahead. Go.
10141260	10144540	Really abuse or gaslight or manipulate people around him into feeling a certain way.
10144540	10147820	And he draws them in, in such an unbelievably effective way that he can get them to feel almost
10147820	10152460	whatever he wants them to. And I think that, um, I think that he's done that now with, uh, with,
10152460	10158060	uh, with people in his, in people in his immediate orbit. So.
10160140	10164140	Oh, I do have a question though, really quick. What I was trying to, where do we go? It didn't
10164140	10169740	work. Um, what I was trying to describe to you, did that have like any kind of basis in
10169740	10174700	psychology or is that like a, like a fallacy or an effect or something? Or is it just like
10174700	10179500	something I've pulled out of my ass? Sorry. The stuff on psychology was, is what?
10180620	10186140	Oh, um, when I mentioned the importance of a behavior is not what it looks like, but,
10186140	10191020	but what the person's mind state is likely to be is more or less likely to be when,
10191020	10195180	is that like a fallacy or is it a, is it like a known psych thing? Is it like,
10195180	10198780	because I like, I'm not educated enough to know what these things actually are, or if somebody
10198780	10201820	else has described this before. So I'm just wondering if it's like a thing.
10201820	10206780	Uh, I mean, you could argue, maybe I've never heard it. Um, it's probably more of a philosophy
10206780	10211420	if it's anything, um, kind of like a philosophy of human, which in fairness, like psychology and
10211420	10216540	philosophy are like deeply interlinked for obvious reasons. In fact, psychology is born out of
10216540	10224140	philosophy. Um, yeah, so no, but it's a really interesting, it's a unique, it's at least gotten
10224140	10228220	me thinking so good job. I've never been exposed to it before. Well done.
10229980	10233580	Let's, let's keep going though. Yeah. Work on you though. Well,
10233580	10236060	because obviously I'm not, I'm not going to be labeled, not like that. Okay.
10236780	10239740	Okay. Um,
10243420	10247420	let's, I'm trying to think of the order I want to do this in. Let me put together what I think,
10247420	10250140	what I think Max's mind looks like. I think, okay. This is what I think.
10251260	10255820	I think that Max is extremely narcissistic. And when I say narcissistic, what I mean by that is
10255820	10259660	I don't know if Max can ever be wrong about anything. I don't know if he ever sees himself
10259660	10263980	as being in the wrong. I think that if something happens and it is wrong because other people
10264060	10267340	either don't understand or other people are trying to abuse him or other people are making mistakes
10267340	10270140	that just puts them outside of the ability to understand what's going on inside of his head.
10270780	10273740	I've noticed this conversationally when he talks to people, he seems unwilling to ever back off
10273740	10277820	a read he has on somebody. And I've noticed this when it comes to settling interpersonal drama with
10277820	10280540	the stuff with Lex Friedman or that professor that he blew up on a stream or that he blew up
10280540	10284540	on Twitter. It seems like he can't ever take any kind of feedback there. And I've noticed it. Um,
10284540	10287180	oh, there's one more thing I was gonna say. I think, um, I was gonna say professionally,
10287980	10291900	um, happens in a personally happens during conversations. Oh, we're going to get to me
10291900	10295900	that where, um, anytime, anytime something negative happens, it's, it's always some other
10295900	10299340	person's fault. It's always like another person that's making these mistakes. Um,
10301660	10307980	so I think the scary thing is that in Max's mind, uh, hero, his own.
10308940	10316140	Okay. In your experience with, with Max, has it ever come off as, um, when he does what
10316140	10322780	destiny is describing here, has it ever come off as like a defense mechanism shrouded in jokes?
10323340	10327340	Because I know a lot of, a lot of men do that where like, when they're wrong about something,
10327340	10331100	they'll be like, ah, fuck you. I'm, I'm actually right. But that, but they know they're wrong and
10331100	10336300	they're just kind of like making light of it. What destiny just did just there or what max does.
10336300	10341980	Sorry. Uh, what destiny is describing max is doing as like, like when destiny said like max
10341980	10346780	never views himself as wrong. He never takes criticism. Um, it's pretty common among like
10346780	10352140	male friends when they're criticized their acceptance of the criticism is them saying,
10352140	10356460	ha ha, fuck you. I'm right in kind of like a jokey way. Does that sound like what max does?
10357820	10363340	I actually don't find that max does the escape through humor that much. Um, I think because in
10363340	10369100	part he like really would criticize it. It is a very classic thing men do in general,
10369100	10373420	um, that I've noticed it's like a distinctive, like, I think all people do it, but I noticed
10373420	10376460	that like the classic band thing, I'll be like, as soon as we're getting into like any level of
10376460	10382140	like fee fees, we like avoid through humor, um, which is like adaptive and functional.
10382140	10384940	I don't feel like I've noticed max doing it that much though, personally.
10385900	10387580	Okay. All right. Yeah. Sorry.
10389420	10393340	World and nothing can get in the way of that. Like if he's on a mission, if he's on a crusade,
10393340	10396860	he has to like, he's the only one that can task with figuring things out. And if you
10396860	10398700	misunderstand, you just have to talk to like his most loyal fans. They'll tell you you're
10398700	10403740	not smart enough to understand if you don't otherwise. Right. So damn, I'm trying to think
10403740	10409740	of how much I can even say. Um, a few days ago, uh, I started to get a whole bunch of messages
10409740	10414940	from people saying that I'm not gonna say who, but it's been a lot, a lot of people that have been
10414940	10419180	reaching out to me saying that max has been contacting every single woman I've ever had in
10419180	10422940	my discord in the background and a whole bunch of men trying to get lists of women that I've ever
10422940	10428300	spoken to. And in his mind, he's built up this idea that I have a, essentially the following
10428300	10432780	fetish that I approach a woman. I float the idea of her being on my stream. If she fucks me,
10432780	10435820	I fucked the woman. Then I bring her on stream and I have my entire fan base attacker because
10435820	10439580	I get off on that. And then I run her out of my community. And I think he's built almost this
10439580	10443900	entire narrative off of mining Anna Vienna personally for stories and information. I don't
10443900	10447740	know when they started talking, but I think that he's really good at talking to people and building
10447740	10449820	them up in the ways that they want to be built up so that he can get the information from them
10449820	10453500	that they want to give him. And yeah, him and Anna have been talking a lot in the background.
10453500	10457660	He's got this archetype or narrative in his head for how I treat women on my stream. And he's also
10457660	10460460	got love who I just love reveal that we hooked up. Now you know how fucking irritating it was.
10460460	10462540	Every time she would claim that I'm only defending a woman because we hooked up on the blah, blah,
10462540	10465980	blah, but I can't be public on the fact that we hooked up. So between him live and Anna,
10465980	10469020	now he has in his head, he's built up this archetype and his head up. This is what Steven
10469020	10472300	does to people. I've got two women here who maybe feel abused or mistreated by his community.
10472300	10475900	And then what he's doing is he's trying to find every other girl that I've spoken to,
10475900	10482140	to see if that he could get similar stories out of them. Now, I don't know how many women he's
10482140	10486220	talked to so far, 10 or 20 or 30 or more. I know that he's been trying desperately to get in
10486220	10489820	contact with people like Denims and Bad Bunny. I know that he's messaged a ton of people asking
10489820	10493820	for lists of women that I've spoken to. I know that when I found this out two days ago, I started
10493820	10496460	going down my list of friends and right clicking and doing the properties. And I suddenly started
10496460	10500460	to notice that Mr. Girl was mutual friends with every single girl on my friends list that I've
10500460	10503980	ever spoken to. And I think what he's doing, and I can't prove this, I don't know, but if anybody
10503980	10505900	wants to come for a show, I think what he's doing is he's calling all of these people in the
10505900	10509020	background. And I think that he's asking them through long conversations or trying to convince
10509020	10514380	them that I'm doing something improper or wrong. Wow.
10514380	10517980	This is extra frustrating for a few different- That might be a spot.
10518540	10520140	Yeah. What do you think of that?
10524300	10531980	Basically disgusting. I don't know how else to say it. Destiny is Max's lifeline for a career. So
10531980	10535660	people are trying to be like, Max is just trying to gain more clout. He's just going on another
10535660	10540380	attack to save his career. I don't know if it's that simple. Max is convinced that he's the
10540380	10547980	righteous moral crusader. And he holds to this probably unhealthily and he will do so at the
10547980	10554140	cost of his career. I think that's evident because attacking Destiny, like Destiny probably has,
10555340	10560140	doesn't he use Destiny's website formatting and all this sorts of stuff? He's his last lifeline
10560140	10566540	on YouTube. He made his career in a lot of ways. So I really do see it as like this moral crusade,
10567500	10571420	but rather than giving his friend any level of benefit of the doubt, not just like friend.
10574380	10579740	Like Destiny just said that he opened up, he said, I'm going to try doing friendship because people
10579740	10584620	told me that that's the right thing to do to be more of a human. So I opened up and was vulnerable
10584620	10590780	with Max and Lav and a couple of other people. And so for Max to like, know that Max has
10590780	10596060	ultimately regularly said that Steven is like shut down, that he's like got problems in his
10596060	10602700	relationships. And then to do this behind Steven's back is like the ultimate betrayal of friendship
10602700	10609180	in like a pretty extreme way. And I think it's gross. Like, I think it's actually really gross.
10609180	10615020	And the problem is that like Max is not the champion for women. He was never be a champion
10615020	10619580	that I would select for women. Every woman who has been on stream, who has disagreed with them,
10619580	10625980	he has aggressively attacked. I have been doxxed. I have had my work companies contacted by some of
10625980	10631980	his crazy fans. I have had multiple of his fans from burner counts send me nasty things to me
10631980	10638220	and Steven. I've been attacked ruthlessly by his fans. And in large part, most of the questioning
10638220	10643100	about my credentials comes in large part from Max. And a lot of people basically saying that
10643100	10647500	I have no salt to stand on, that I have no credence to anything I say on psychology
10647500	10652220	is in large part from him. He's basically implied that I am worse than a rape apologist within
10652220	10658380	psychology and that clients aren't safe with me, right? Like, and this isn't just me. Then
10659420	10663500	Brittany Simon disagreed with him on things. He went on the attack with her, right? The first
10663500	10667500	time that like Stardust basically like put up a fucking boundary with him, he went on the attack
10667500	10673180	with her instead of weaponizing her like previous lice experiences against her to get the boundary
10673180	10677740	to go down, which is, she just said, I just like, I just need to cool down and blah, blah, blah,
10677740	10681580	and to like make his major point. Like he has this consistent pattern with women that it's like,
10681580	10687660	don't you fucking now use women's experiences to try to attack your friend because you're mad that
10687660	10693500	you got banned on his discord. Don't fucking do it. It's not a moral crusade. It's a petty fight
10693500	10700140	that you're making worse. And it's fucking gross. It's insane to me. This is insane. I can't like,
10700140	10707900	this is worse than Boston Hassan combined for sure. Um, I entirely agree with everything that
10707900	10713900	you've said. Do you mind if I steal me on the other side for a bit? Sure. Go for it. Okay.
10718300	10721020	Going, going back to the start of the stream, when I said something like,
10721740	10725180	if you have a belief about the world to you, it's not a belief. It's the way the world is.
10727420	10734860	If Max genuinely believed in his, in his deepest heart of hearts, that destiny actually was some
10734860	10740940	sort of abuser, and he was going to go on what he thinks is actually a righteous crusade against
10740940	10745100	women, or sorry, against destiny for all the women he's abused and he's collecting all this evidence.
10745420	10749900	It seems like this would be exactly how a person like that would behave.
10753820	10757260	He would be calling these people and he would be talking to them and he'd be trying to
10757260	10766060	understand what's going on. So it's, it's, it's not immediately obvious to me that he's,
10766060	10769580	that he's just evil. He might actually believe this stuff delusionally.
10769580	10778060	The issue is if you believe in a self lie to the extent that it does an unabashed amount of damage
10778060	10784860	to everyone around you, at what point do we not say, I don't know if I still want to say evil,
10784860	10789980	evil is a really big word, but how do we not say this is obviously deeply wrong?
10791980	10797660	Yeah, I, I, I do tend to agree with you there. I mean, I'm, I'm trying to see it from his point
10797660	10801740	of view. I know that's why I want you here. Fucking base gig at Chad steel manner.
10803100	10806940	And, and like, even from his point of view, like, let's say that max actually believes this,
10806940	10810380	and let's say he calls up a dozen of these women and a dozen of these women are like,
10810380	10814460	no, man, everything's fine. I'm sure at least some of them have said that if it actually has
10814460	10818060	been 20 or 30 women, I'm sure at least a few of them have said things are fine. I think,
10818060	10826300	I think you reach a point where enough evidence independent of your, your own biases and your own
10826300	10832300	biases in your own, your own viewpoint, you know, your own subjectivity and enough real world
10832300	10838140	evidence to stack up that maybe you start questioning your hypothesis. Right. I guess
10838140	10841820	basically I would say like there are reasonable lease and unreasonable beliefs and a rational
10841820	10848140	actor must be held account for their unreasonable beliefs, particularly if your unreasonable beliefs
10848140	10852460	are being targeted and aimed towards somebody that you claimed, I will never betray you.
10852460	10858060	And who you claimed is a good friend of yours and that you love, right? This is not what love
10858060	10863660	looks like eat land. Like here's the thing. Let's assume that he does think that this is going on
10863660	10870220	when you love somebody and they've, and they're doing a really bad thing that a loving person
10870220	10873500	still addresses the behavior. I'm not saying that if he actually thinks that this is going on,
10873500	10877020	that he should just yes, man, and dismissed it. Let's, let's assume in the worst case that he
10877020	10881660	act like, cause I believe that he does believe this to some degree. And he actually is worried
10881660	10887820	that there's like an abuse pattern that's being established here, but this is also a friend that
10887820	10895020	you love. So the question is, if you're actually thinking in any way about a person that you love
10895020	10902300	and the victims and being responsible with the enormity of the claims that you're trying to make
10902300	10909180	and putting together a reasonable actor does not act in this way. This to me looks like
10909180	10917260	petulant behavior driven by anger and motivated thinking to construe a re a narrative based on
10917260	10926700	his unreasonable belief in a situation. Yeah. And that's the problem. Yeah.
10927660	10931420	That or max is crazy enough to just be disregarded. But if we're going to take his claim
10931420	10935820	seriously at all, then we have to seriously look at how he's behaving. And if you're
10935820	10942300	making this size of claim against somebody, you claim that you love with potentially abuse,
10942300	10947820	sexual abuse, allegations of multiple women, you owe it to the women and to your friend to be as
10947820	10952300	maximally responsible as possible. And in no way is this maximally responsible.
10953420	10959100	Okay. I think I've, I think, I think, I think my brain just expanded a size or two here. Okay.
10959340	10965500	Okay. All right. One of the, one of the Yudowskian things that I learned when I was studying that
10965500	10971660	sort of stuff was an argument that he called privileging the hypothesis and privileging
10971660	10977740	hypothesis. It goes something like this. Okay. It's something like, let's say you live in a city
10977740	10982780	with a million people. Okay. And then a murder happens in the city. And then it's your job to
10982780	10988140	figure out who who's the murderer. And you have no evidence at all. You have no evidence about
10988140	10993180	who could, who could the murderer, the murderer me. And then you decide to say, I think it's you,
10993180	10996060	Dev. You point the finger at me. You're the murderer. And I'm like, Oh, I'm the murderer.
10996060	11000380	You're pointing me out. I'm the murderer. With no, with no proof at all. You just have a hypothesis
11000380	11007180	that it might be me. And then it comes out later that a witness saw that the murderer had brown
11007180	11016060	hair and I have brown hair. So now you're like, Oh, my hypothesis was correct. Dev has brown hair.
11016060	11019980	I think he's the murderer. The murderer had brown hair. And so now you start running,
11019980	11025020	you start investigating and you start finding more evidence that pins me as the murderer. Now,
11025020	11030620	in reality, I wasn't the murderer, but because you started with a faulty hypothesis, your
11030620	11036060	investigation is going to naturally lead you in a way that makes you think like you're, you're
11036060	11040140	getting at the truth, but you're actually not. Yes. And so this is why I would say here, not
11040140	11045420	being in that case, you're engaging in motivated thinking. If you actually want to take a charge
11045420	11049980	of murder seriously, or sexual abuse seriously, you need to do better thinking than that. And
11049980	11055500	you're responsible for being a fool in your process. For example, if he genuinely thought
11055500	11060780	that this was serious, why didn't he approach women who he knows that he has contention with
11060780	11066700	and is maybe somewhat more warm towards destiny to vet the opposing side. For example, why didn't
11066700	11072540	he approach me or somebody else who's maybe more friendly, right? It's very market. The women that
11072540	11080380	are getting included, um, by like at least Lav and Max, that to me is extremely suspicious and begs
11080380	11085820	that there's motivated thinking, if not intentionally being done, horrifically,
11085820	11092540	irrationally done to a level that is basically disregardable. And if it is intentionally done
11092540	11097500	and he realizes that there are certain people who will not yes, man, his story, and he's not
11097500	11100780	approaching them. Now you're now you're a malicious actor.
11102380	11108860	Yeah, yeah. So you see this a lot in like the, the YouTube video essayist community,
11108860	11113980	where people will find that they will find evidence, real evidence that suits their their
11113980	11119340	views. And then they'll present that evidence in a very responsible way. But evidence that
11119340	11123180	specifically goes against their views, they won't present it at all, the pretend doesn't exist.
11123180	11128620	And so they go down one tree of logic, and they come to correct conclusions, and they have
11128620	11133820	correct ideas. But they're completely ignoring everything else that is also true that causes
11133820	11140780	them problems. And when it comes to a more serious thing like this, where you're accusing somebody of
11140780	11146700	something you kind of have to have you have to, you have to explore all the ways in which you
11146700	11152700	might be wrong. Before you start like going on the warpath, you know what I mean? And if you don't,
11152780	11158060	then it just it seems like you have a preset idea that you're that you're you're privileging
11158060	11162460	the hypothesis. That's what my this area of the internet that I'm in calls it.
11164300	11168780	Which is why it's very good that you're here to steal land against me because I want to be as
11169500	11176860	doing my best. But to not do that, I'm glad it's useful. Acknowledge my biases. Number one,
11176860	11181580	I've had a growing frustration with Max, I exchange him a massive margin of error,
11181580	11186460	even after he treated me horrifically twice and then refused to engage with me on anything but
11186460	11192300	the thing where he wanted to basically berate me over. And I was still charitable towards him. In
11192300	11197660	fact, I did a documentary still speaking decently, warmly about him. And then I watched how we treated
11197660	11205420	Stardust. And then I watched how he treated Steven in the past stuff. And I will admit,
11205420	11211180	I have a strong disdain for him now. So I am definitely biased against Max. And Steven is
11211180	11215660	a good friend of mine, genuinely a good friend, like on and off stream. And no, we're not fucking
11215660	11224620	sexual. It's very hard to find a tonic mature older streamers to be friends with. I'm sure
11224620	11230220	you probably know that personally. And so I think they somewhat cling to one another.
11231100	11234620	It is it is less of a problem with me because I'm a guy but I do know what you mean. Yeah.
11234620	11238380	Yeah, yeah. Brittany Sime is another person that I would say I'm personally friends with
11238380	11242140	off stream as well. She's very, very mature and whatnot.
11242940	11244380	Really? She's kind of out there.
11245740	11251980	She's got strange ideas, but she's like, a very good person, like a deeply, deeply good person.
11251980	11255340	She's got some bad ideas. And like, there's certain things where I could be like, okay,
11255340	11262700	Brittany, fuck, don't say that shit. Like, Jesus. Yeah, but she does care. Okay,
11262700	11265660	let's keep going. Everyone's like, we're like an hour behind now.
11266060	11272060	reasons. One is because there are some people that Mr. Girl, I think can only confront because
11272060	11276060	of very personal, very private information that I've told him. So he's taken that information.
11276060	11279660	And he's basically used it to lie to other people or attack me in the background, which is
11279660	11282860	very frustrating, because it's very rare that I share a secret with somebody don't have very many.
11283900	11289260	Wait, wait, wait, hold on. He's taken girl, I think can only confront because of very personal,
11289260	11293020	very private information that I've told him. So he's taken that information. And he's basically
11293020	11296540	used it to lie to other people or attack me in the background, which is very frustrating,
11296540	11299740	because it's very rare that I share a secret with home. Did you hear that?
11300540	11305660	Yep. Yep. That's, that's pretty rough. Fuck that. This is even worse than that. Fuck everything.
11305660	11310300	I'm like trying to be like, let's try to hear the other side, but holy fuck. Can you imagine
11310940	11315580	somebody with trust issues finally opens up, tells you very personal information,
11315580	11320780	and then you weaponize that against them elsewhere in a private space. What the fuck is wrong with
11320780	11325100	you? Does destiny of trust, trust issues? I don't know that about him.
11328060	11332540	Uh, I would say so. I would say any streamer last in this space for too long.
11332540	11337980	It's probably pretty big. Trust. I mean, I mean, I don't. I mean, I've been here for a while. And
11338540	11341420	I've had multiple cancelings and backstabbings. But I mean, I'm,
11342140	11346700	I can, you know what, I maybe I'm just unique. I consider everyone I talk to a friend until they
11346700	11350220	show me they're not a friend. So I have many friends. Also, the world's better that way when
11350220	11354620	I have many friends. I feel like I, somebody just said, did you say Brittany has bad ideas?
11354620	11358380	I don't think actually Brittany has bad ideas. Um, I think that she has ideas that she doesn't
11358380	11362060	always communicate super well. So people understand them, but actually a lot of her
11362060	11367260	ideas are really, really interesting and smart and cool. So yeah. Oh, sounds neat.
11371980	11376540	So that's one thing that's very irritating. And then two, cause I think I was genuinely like a
11376540	11379900	pretty good friend to Max and Lav. Although I guess they both don't feel that way because
11379900	11384860	my subreddit should have them for awhile. Um, but like, I'm not sure, I guess in the future,
11384860	11389420	I need to write like strict rules for, um, I need to write strict rules for how people are going to
11389420	11392140	interact with me on stream or something, because I guess if the subreddit is mean to them for a few
11392140	11394940	days, they're going to lose their fucking mind. I guess a quick steel man, a quick steel man,
11394940	11399580	I could probably insert here is something like a lot of whenever you have like viewers interacting
11399580	11403260	with streamers or, or small YouTubers are interacting with large YouTubers, there's
11403260	11409260	definitely a knee jerk reaction. That's pretty common that if the personality themselves treats
11409260	11414940	you well, but their audience treats you poorly, that reflects on the personality. And I don't
11414940	11419180	think that's fair, but I think it's common. Yeah. And there's this trick where like,
11419180	11422700	how much are you accountable to your community? Like how much is the community reflection of you?
11422700	11427260	Cause I think it is to some extent of reflection of you. Um, the issue is that
11428540	11433340	destiny is somebody who's very critical. He's critical of his friends and he's critical of
11433340	11438700	the world. And he tends to be very open about that. I mean, he, I remember like the first,
11438700	11442140	one of the first times we had like a, a chat, like one-on-one, he was like, I need you to be
11442140	11446940	warned that I'm a big asshole. So like, I don't want to, I don't want to mince words about that.
11446940	11450860	It's super fair if that's like, not for you, but I'm not like, I'm not going to pretend,
11450860	11454380	just, I really want you to understand that. And that's like, I've watched your, a bit of your
11454380	11459340	content. I'm fully aware that you're an asshole. Um, right. He's very, very blunt and dry and like
11459340	11463580	prone to criticism and not very prone to compliments as well. Right. Because in many
11463580	11468380	ways, this is a projection of Steven. He doesn't find compliments meaningful and he finds criticisms
11468380	11473500	helpful and interesting and kind of fun. Right. And so like, he only offers what he kind of
11473500	11477180	appreciates, but the problem is that that's not the same for everyone else, which he realizes,
11477180	11481580	but it's hard to operate outside of your own, like essentially quote unquote, love language.
11482780	11486220	That, that sounds kind of like me too, but I do like compliments from my girlfriend,
11486220	11490300	at least that's nice. That's true. But yeah, like I also see, I also someone who
11490300	11495660	I also love when Naomi compliments me. Oh, Oh, okay. I see how it is.
11499020	11503740	Yeah. Um, Oh, this is so bad and sad.
11504540	11506220	That entire fucking stream with erudite was fucking disgusting,
11506220	11508620	where he's pushing to share shit with him to prove that you love him. Yeah. It's pretty weird.
11508620	11511580	But, um, I think at the end of the day, I think that he's just like, again, highly narcissistic,
11511580	11515500	highly manipulative. And, um, yeah, that's kind of what, that's just what he does.
11516380	11518940	How many different people did you confirm that he contacted? Uh, I'm not gonna release numbers
11518940	11521580	because I don't really want him to know what I know. Is he doing this because of the subreddit
11521580	11524700	stuff? I don't really know what flipped the switch in his mind. Do you have any evidence or receipts?
11524700	11527660	I have a ton of evidence and a ton of receipts. Of course. I'm not gonna go public with something
11527660	11531100	like this with somebody that shady without obviously having some idea of what's actually
11531100	11535740	going on in the background manifesto time. Oh, I don't really want to quote any of these in
11535740	11539020	particular because I don't want him to know who sent me stuff, but he used phrases alluding to
11539020	11543020	the fact that I like very carefully choose which women I want to victimize. Um, he's repeated this
11543020	11546140	pattern that like, my goal is to abuse women by bringing them on stream and having my community
11546140	11549420	make fun of them after I fuck them. Um, you had laugh today, alluding to the fact that I guess
11549420	11551980	I'm Harvey Weinstein on stream because I have sex with a lot of people that come through my
11551980	11556620	community, which I'm gonna do. But, um, the, the way that I always kind of saw it going in my head
11556620	11560780	is if anybody ever tried to me to me, um, all I would ever say to that person is like, Hey, listen,
11560780	11563580	Oh, you think I was improper? Okay. Well leak all of our DMS. Or if you don't want to, I will
11563580	11569660	leak our entire DM history. Um, because I always figured that like, obviously, um, I usually have
11569660	11572300	really candid conversations about like my expectations for people like sexually or
11572300	11575900	whatever. Um, so like, like for instance, these are messages that I sent back to lab in August.
11575900	11578700	Okay. Early August. I don't know how many months ago that is. So like, I'll literally say things
11578700	11581260	like, Oh, Hey, just because you've been on stream more and whatnot. I know we've had some kind of
11581260	11583740	sexual conversations in the past, but you being on my stream or the way they interact with you
11583740	11586380	never has anything to do with any of that kind of stuff. Just being clear on that. She says
11586380	11589100	something and I say, I'm just saying, don't feel like any of your interactions are contingent on
11589100	11591260	anything like that. You're fine doing whatever. So don't you feel like I'm keeping you around
11591260	11593900	for anything related to sex, et cetera. Like I usually have very, very, very explicit
11593900	11598300	conversations with almost everybody about stuff like this. Um, I'll say it, I'll set it a million
11598300	11602300	times. If anybody out there, any woman ever feels like I'm being improper, feel free to like show
11602300	11605180	in DMS where I'm pressuring you or growing your journey, where she like that, those DMS don't
11605180	11608940	exist because it doesn't happen. Um, the only thing that I'm a little bit worried about when
11608940	11613980	it comes to max is because he's so manipulative. The, the, um, the struggle that I have is that I
11613980	11618220	think he probably could get like, I actually want to speak to this. So a lot of people assume that
11618220	11622620	we're having sex, which I will never fully be able to dispel. I actually want to say there was
11622620	11626940	one moment where we flirted a little bit in like very low key. And I imagine he won't care about
11626940	11631020	this. And then he immediately was like, Hey, just so you know, I don't know what the boundaries are.
11631020	11634220	And I want to be really careful. Cause I realized you're married and I don't want to make you or
11634220	11637740	Nick uncomfortable at any point. So I just need you to like explicitly tell me like,
11637740	11640940	what are the boundaries in lines are? And I was like, Oh yeah, Nick. And I think that like
11640940	11645260	flirting is like just another form of like kind of social communication. Um, it would probably
11645260	11649420	never go beyond that for me personally. Um, so like that would be basically my line is there's
11649420	11652860	like, never, this would never escalate to anything ever. And I would never want it assumed on the
11652860	11657100	table more or less. And he was like, okay, based. And now we don't even do that. We're just,
11657100	11663100	we're just actually just like fully platonic friends. Right. Right. Yeah. Um,
11663900	11667980	Hmm. Can you rewind it to 30 seconds? If you don't mind. Yeah.
11670780	11673900	Just being clear on that. Okay. Early August. I don't know how many months ago that is. So like,
11673900	11676460	I'll literally say things like, Oh, Hey, just because you've been on stream more and whatnot.
11676460	11678940	I know we've had some kind of sexual conversations in the past, but you being on my stream or the way
11678940	11681580	they interact with you never has anything to do with any of that kind of stuff. Just being clear
11681580	11684460	on that. She says something and I say, I'm just saying, don't feel like any of your interactions
11684460	11686860	are contingent on anything like that. You're fine doing whatever. So when you feel like I'm keeping
11686860	11689740	you around for anything related to sex, et cetera, like I usually have very, very, very explicit
11689740	11694140	conversations with almost everybody about stuff like this. Um, I'll say it, I'll set it a million
11694140	11698140	times. If anybody out there, any woman ever feels like I'm being improper, feel free to like show
11698140	11701420	in DMS where I'm pressuring you or growing or doing research like that. Those DMS don't exist
11701420	11705340	because it doesn't happen. Um, the only thing that I'm a little bit worried about when it comes to
11705340	11713180	max is because he's, um, it's a, it's a strange phenomenon, but I've had at least a dozen people
11713180	11717900	over the course of, since my channel, you know, hit over a hundred thousand subs,
11717900	11724300	at least a dozen people send me nudes unprompted. Um, and it's always very strange. I don't know how
11724300	11728060	to deal with that. You know, it's like, okay, that's, you know, giga chat. I got some nudes,
11728060	11732060	but like in actuality, it's very strange. I don't, I don't know what to do with that. I don't know
11732060	11739500	what to say. And you know, there, you know, you can't, there's a power dynamic that comes with
11739500	11746060	when you're talking to someone that you look up to that I think some, there may be some personality
11746060	11750540	types of people or some, some types of people, something, some people, they, they're just going
11750540	11756700	to always feel coerced, even if you're not trying to, you know, so generally, and I've learned that
11756700	11763900	through a few bad experiences of my own. So I generally just like, don't reply, just a safety,
11763900	11767820	you know, it was not somebody I know, it was just like a random new drop. I'm just like, nope,
11767820	11772300	not going to reply to that because I could be like, Oh, that's great. Send me some more. And
11772300	11775820	then they might feel pressured to do it. Or I can say like, Oh, thank you. Or Oh, don't send me
11775820	11782700	that. And it feels like nothing I can say, is ever a good thing to say. Because that it might
11782700	11789180	be the kind of person who just who, I don't know, do you know what I'm saying? I do understand what
11789180	11795100	you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know it, too, I guess to even then, though, like, it doesn't
11795100	11799980	really excuse any of this behavior. But it may be the case that some people just by virtue of
11799980	11805100	interacting with destiny feel pressured, even if he's not being pressuring, you know?
11806940	11815740	Yes, I understand that the problem is, at some point when consent is being negotiated explicitly,
11815740	11819980	if you're still feeling some sort of way, and the other actor has shown to you that they're
11819980	11824780	very comfortable with an explicit exchange, it's fundamentally on you to voice that. And I know
11824780	11829420	that sounds like literally been blaming. But the reality is, like, I literally can't imagine a
11829420	11834860	world. Because, first of all, because of students trust issues, there's no world in which a girl
11834860	11838220	would text and be like, just you know, I'm feeling a little bit pressured, like sexually, I'm not
11838220	11843020	sure I'm comfortable with this, where Steve would ever be like, what do you mean? Come on, like,
11843020	11849340	I can't even picture it. And to be honest, if it had happened, so many people hate this motherfucker
11849340	11853740	that it would have been leaked by now. Like you would be the most popular girl on the internet,
11853740	11858620	like overnight, if you had that fucking content. The reality is, like, I'm sure he's very aware of
11858620	11863420	optics seems like he's very intense about consent. And he's pretty explicit about consent as well.
11863420	11867740	So it's just like at some point, if you're still feeling like some level of innate pressure,
11867740	11872620	it is on you to voice that or to step away. Like you have to negotiate this with it.
11873340	11876940	Yes, by the way, you pause at the great the greatest frame that is a good face.
11877900	11883340	So manipulative, the struggle that I have is that I think he probably could get like two or
11883340	11886220	three girls like fucked out of their head, and like, try to get them on stream. Like, oh, yeah,
11886220	11888620	actually, you know, I think about this, it's kind of feels like really bad, because his community
11888620	11891820	made fun of me or some shit. And even if I have a really good response, if I get like three or four
11891820	11894460	girls in a row that all have these types of like emotional stories, it just makes me look bad, no
11894460	11898380	matter what. I will say that it's extra frustrating that Max is trying to do to me, basically, what
11898380	11901500	Sherry and Stardust did to him except on a much lesser level, where he like talks to people, hikes
11901500	11904140	them up, tries to convince them that they were abused, and then tries to get them out. And then
11904140	11905980	talks to people, hikes them up, tries to convince them that they were abused,
11905980	11908060	and then tries to get them out. I also think it's really gross that,
11908060	11911100	despite me and Anna's past shit, me and Anna have been like relatively chill, I think,
11911100	11913020	for like the past year. I haven't had any complaints about her, no problems or whatever.
11913020	11915180	Obviously, I think she did better in the past. She thinks I've been better in the past. I haven't
11915180	11918780	really had any problems with her for like, I don't know, for like a year or more. But Max has
11918780	11922140	been talking to her a lot in the background now. And I noticed that she's starting to echo a lot
11922140	11926300	of what Max has told her to me and to other people in DMs. So basically, her, Max, and Lav have been
11926300	11929660	running around in DMs in the background, basically talking to a ton of people to try to see if there
11929660	11932300	are people that I've sexually abused or manipulated or anything like that.
11935740	11940780	There's another really big thing here that this is kind of, there's this really weird misnomer
11940780	11945020	around ethics specifically, where people feel like if something is risky, it's inherently also
11945020	11951260	unethical. The issue is riskiness isn't inherently unethical. It's only unethical if you take a risk
11951260	11955900	and it ends really poorly for somebody. Now it is retroactively unethical, and you're going to be
11955900	11961180	in big fucking shit, but also sometimes people will take risks and it will work out very well
11961180	11965900	for all better things. So like power differentials creates a risky situation. There is a little bit
11965900	11971740	more complex, unspeakable factors that even if you gain explicit consent, always exists in this kind
11971740	11975660	of abstract, amorphous thing that you can't navigate. The reality though, is that power
11975660	11980940	dynamics and sexual relationships do and can exist all the time. And a lot of times it's completely
11980940	11986380	healthy. For example, a very common power differential relationship is men who have sex
11986380	11992060	and date women, because there is always a power differential between the muscle and physical
11992060	11996700	capacity of a man compared to a woman. But that doesn't make it unethical that the man is having
11996700	12000220	sex with the woman. And it doesn't make it a problem that they form a relationship. It means
12000220	12005020	that there's a higher responsibility on the person with the greater power in specifically that
12005020	12010220	dynamic to be extra scrupulous and responsible. But that doesn't mean that the relationship in and
12010220	12013820	of itself is unethical because there's a power differential. And I really fucking hate that this
12013820	12018460	has been like this weird construction. It's so fucking weird. The only relationships that are
12018460	12023180	objectively obviously unethical, or when there are codified practices that make it clear that sexual
12023180	12027660	interactions cannot happen here, because at that point you're being unethical because you're
12027660	12035660	breaching a codified ethic that everyone has agreed to. I can kind of explain this,
12036460	12039980	but it might take a long time. And it might be too much of a derail.
12041500	12046700	Because, yeah, maybe I can just TLDR it without like going into super detail. Um,
12047660	12054620	there's a component of political theory on the left, that basically does define risk,
12055260	12063740	and does define differences in in comparative power. And it even defines the very concept of
12063740	12070060	negotiation as being unethical. And there's a whole wing of political theory on this and
12070060	12076780	they describe why and they describe how. And it's extremely toxic, because who the fuck actually
12076780	12081740	thinks like this in real life. But there's a political component to this. And then that
12081740	12087580	political component, if you believe in this sort of politics, it does filter down into other things
12087580	12095020	like sexual consent, for example. Yeah, I it would take it would it would be like,
12095900	12100140	it's already getting late. And it's kind of a derailment. Maybe it's maybe it's a conversation
12100140	12103500	we could talk about. Yeah, there is, we should throw it in our chat and then pin it.
12104860	12107900	Because every time we're like, let's chat, we're like, what are we talking about?
12109260	12114860	But because there is like a political science component of this, this conversation where it's
12114860	12121180	like, there's some political writers that have delegitimized the very notion of compromise.
12121740	12126700	And and every interaction with any other person, unless you're complete pure equals and always
12126700	12129420	is non consensual. It's a crazy line of politics.
12129420	12135340	Same, it's insane. And it's actually so bad for it. Like it's brain rot. It's actual brain rot.
12135340	12137980	But yeah, okay, let's, I'll write that in our chat.
12138860	12140380	Yeah, I'll put it in a text file or something.
12144860	12150220	Do you regret giving Mr. Girl a career? I don't know. I'm actually really surprised at this. I'm
12150220	12153500	not gonna lie. I feel like Max is so much to lose by like, I don't think I'll pull the plug on site
12153500	12155580	because I'm just not that kind of person. Although I think if I did, I don't think anybody would
12155580	12158700	think that I was in the wrong to do so. Like, I can see his income. I see like everything he does
12158700	12161180	on the back end of his site that is like running my shit. Like I could have just pulled the plug
12161180	12164140	on that. I don't know why. I don't know why he would think it like, but then I guess even just
12164140	12166700	saying that does that make me sound abusive? Like I have no idea. I don't know what the expectations
12166700	12171340	are. Something that I was gonna go off on. Something that I was gonna go off on related
12171340	12175500	to the conservative shit is that I'm really, really, really tired. And this has like been
12175500	12179340	wearing me down a lot over the past few months. The reason why I have good conversations with
12179340	12183260	people is because I have to try exceedingly hard to meet them where they're at, which is oftentimes
12183260	12188700	years behind me in terms of emotional maturity. And it is a struggle day in and day out to baby
12188700	12192380	walk people like lab or Mr. Girl through conversations to show them like, this is like,
12192380	12195020	this is why everybody hates you. This is why you're contradicting yourself this way around here.
12195020	12198780	And to be doing that at the same time that they're like constantly attacking me and shitting on me
12198780	12202460	when I'm applying like every fucking ounce of good faith and credibility I possibly can to
12202460	12205740	these people. And then they're like turning around and like calling me an abuser or saying that I'm
12205740	12212300	this or that is very fucking frustrating to me. I'll probably go back to my bunker in a day or two
12212300	12215500	and I'll probably try to like reconsider the amount of chairability that I extend to people
12215500	12222540	because it's just, that's a huge burden. Are you afraid that he would leak your secret? I mean,
12222540	12225020	like he might, the thing that sucks is that like technically none of these leaks really hurt me.
12225020	12227180	They just hurt other people who want to keep their business secret, which I'll always respect if
12227180	12230380	other people want to keep their business secret. I like, I'm always cool with that. But I mean,
12230380	12233580	I guess at this point it's up to those two who seem like they have no boundaries for any of that
12233580	12241420	now. But yeah, the the Mr. Girl, Shaylin laughs stuff is incredibly fucking creepy. I'm assuming
12241420	12244380	that Shaylin is a victim of max instead of assuming that she has any agency at all.
12244380	12247900	That's just the assumption I have because she's so caught in his orbit. But the max conversation
12247900	12251900	with laugh was actually unbelievable. You've been sexting consistently with Anna for a year.
12251900	12254540	Me and Anna don't have any problems. We're fine. You haven't, you haven't
12254540	12258940	been sexting consistently with Anna for a year. Oh my God. He jumps in. Sorry.
12260700	12262220	I know. I thought he jumped into our call.
12264220	12270700	You're like, where is he? That's true. Oh my God. Jesus Christ.
12270700	12273340	I was about to make a joke and say, I have been sexy with Annaver,
12273340	12276380	but somebody is going to clip that and take it out of context. I have not been sexy with Anna.
12276380	12279980	So it's clear. Okay. Everything you say. Oh gosh.
12280780	12286140	He's so loud too. Holy shit. He's so fucking loud. Is it okay on your ears? It's blasting mine.
12286140	12291020	Yeah. Is he doing like the, the infra Haas thing where he's like cranking his mic up to make sure
12291020	12295740	he can be heard? I'm not, so I'm not sure. I don't know. Destiny always asks people to
12295740	12300220	turn their mics down like 15%. So I think it's in part like destiny stuff has probably turned
12300220	12307260	off a little bit. Okay. But her is a lot. What have I said about her? That's a lie. Tell me
12307260	12310140	that she stopped you. She did stop me that she locked. Okay. Then why are you sexting
12310140	12313340	with her still? We're cool. We've been cool for a year, Max. Okay. So you acknowledge
12313340	12315420	that you've been texting with her for a year. I think, yeah, we've had on and off. Sure.
12315980	12321820	Consistently this entire time, every single day. No. What is this him admitting that he's doing
12321820	12328460	sex stuff again with Anna? Yes. What I know about the Anna story kind of sounded like
12329500	12332380	she was never going to do that again because she kind of went a bit unhinged.
12333100	12340140	Sounds like they work their stuff out. All right. The reality is like, I don't know.
12340140	12345820	It's I Yeah, I want to I'm not going to comment on it at all because I don't know what's public.
12347180	12352540	From what I from from a complete outsider's point of view, it sounded like this was somebody that
12352540	12356380	it would be wise to never do anything with again. But you know, you can, I guess he does.
12359340	12361180	But Max, listen to me. Do you understand that we've been fine for a year?
12361900	12365020	When you say we've been fine. That includes that you've been sexting for a year. Sure. Yes.
12365580	12369980	Okay. So when you're saying that she is locking you in the basement of her mind or that she's a
12369980	12372860	traumatic stalker person who's your victim, you have all these people. Can you can you
12372860	12375180	acknowledge that? I haven't said anything bad about her for a year. I said we've been fine.
12375180	12378540	I said the last time I talked to you about her like two weeks ago or 16 days ago or something,
12378540	12381420	you said that she locked you in the basement of her mind. It was a traumatic experience for you.
12381420	12384220	Yeah. Because a year or two ago, she spent two years nonstop talking about me no matter what I
12384220	12388620	did. You understand that that was a year ago. If you pull up clips on my stream ever since I moved
12388620	12391420	to Miami, I've always said me and Anna are cool. It's chill. Like she used to be, I would say,
12391420	12393580	a stalker or she used to be like, whatever, but we're cool. We've been fine for like a year,
12393580	12397820	literally. Okay. So this, the fact that you've been sexting with her is already absorbed into
12397820	12401660	your narrative about this. Do you think that changes anything? Yes, absolutely. I think it.
12401660	12404460	Okay. Have I talked shit about her this past year? Yes. The last time I talked to you,
12404460	12407340	you said that she locked you in the basement of her mind. Locked me in the past. In the past,
12407340	12411420	Max. Oh, okay. Why, tell me, Max, why hasn't Anna come forward with any of this information now?
12411420	12415180	Can you tell me or do you want me to tell everybody why? I don't want to speak on her
12415180	12417260	behalf. Okay. I will. It's because she said she literally wants to remain friends with me. And
12417260	12418860	she said that, and I've had that conversation multiple times. Are you sure you want to be
12418860	12420780	friends? Are you sure about this? And she's like, yeah, this is fine. It's cool. She talks to me.
12420780	12422780	We talk about her shit. Sometimes she loops on stream. Sometimes she talks about her fucking
12422780	12424860	loops. Like, yeah, that's fine. But that's why she won't go public. It's because she's literally
12424860	12426940	told you. And I know she's told you this. And she told me this. Like, yeah, I still want to be
12426940	12428460	friends with you. I was like, okay, fine, whatever. I don't really care that much. It's fine. That's
12428460	12430700	cool. You've got a problem. She loops. Sometimes she talks to me about it and then that's it.
12430700	12432620	Okay. You've built your entire narrative on this one story. And again, to repeat,
12432620	12436380	I'm gonna ask you, this entire narrative that I'm like abusing women sexually, but I'm gonna
12436380	12439100	ask you again. Have I said anything bad about her over the past year? I said in the past,
12439100	12443340	things were bad, but I have seen, I have seen the logs, dude. I have seen her asking you,
12443340	12445980	Hey, why are you calling me a stalker on stream? What's going on? Why is that happening? Yeah.
12445980	12448460	When she gets into her loops, but I don't call her a stalker. I said she used to. And then
12448460	12452140	within two more, two more lines, you're saying you're sending her videos. It depends. Our
12452140	12455340	conversations move back and forth. Sure. Okay. So have you seen the conversation?
12456460	12458220	Like, Hey, do you want to be friends? You don't want to be friends. You want to do this,
12458220	12461260	but like, yeah, we've had plenty of conversations and you can go and ask her where, Hey, have you
12461260	12463180	hold on? No, no, hold on. Cause you're, I know the narrative you're trying to sell where she's
12463180	12467420	explicitly saying I'm keeping her on like some weird, like sexually abusive stream. When I've
12467420	12469020	asked her plenty of times, like, do you still want to talk to you? I want to do whatever.
12469020	12471100	And she's like, okay, well, as long as you want to, sure. That's fine. But I haven't
12471100	12473980	shit talked to her on stream. Sometimes she loops on her stream about me. I don't respond to it on
12473980	12476220	my stream. And I say, everything's cool. Like we're pretty chill. And then boom. That's it.
12477180	12480860	Well, the narrative I have is that while she is getting publicly dog piled by your community
12480860	12485500	and is labeled as a stalker, she's labeled as a crazy person in a stalker that no one is allowed
12485500	12488060	to talk about. And it'll have even mentioning her to you made you threatened to cut laugh off
12488060	12491980	permanently. Why is she considered a crazy person in my community? That's not, I'm not answering
12491980	12494220	that question. That's not talking about it's important because you're blaming it implicitly
12494220	12498140	on me. Me and Anna have talked about this before. It doesn't matter. It matters where the facts
12498140	12502140	come from. It's a fact that Anna is labeled as a stalker in your community. Okay, hold on. I'm
12502140	12505900	meeting you for a second. Okay. So what's happened is, is when Anna goes live on her stream and then
12505900	12510140	she starts looping that gets attention on places like Kiwi farms. Oh, he left. Okay. Easy. Boom.
12510140	12515660	So is the, is, is, is it possible that the difference between them is that Max feels
12515660	12519580	like destiny is far more responsible for the actions of his community than destiny feels like
12519580	12526700	he is? Yes, he basically thinks that destiny needs to, so here's the issue. I don't know what
12526700	12532540	specifically he wants destiny to do other than basically never levy criticisms at any of his
12532540	12539660	friends. Uh, because when in fairness, when destiny criticizes somebody, a lot of people
12539660	12546220	in DGG very much respect him. So if there is an element where destiny can frame the structure of
12546220	12552220	the narrative, right? So if he says erudite is a stupid bitch who fakes her credentials,
12552220	12558220	the reality is that I would need a huge burden of proof to really try to undo the structure
12558220	12562140	of that narrative because people respect his opinion. They know that he checks his sources,
12562140	12566140	which means this is why like destiny is valuable in this space is when he says something is some
12566140	12570060	way people tend to give it a lot of gravity because he's not somebody who says something
12570060	12573660	is just some way and he doesn't have fucking receipts for what he's talking about, right?
12573660	12577820	And so this is why there's this tricky thing of when he labels somebody with a criticism,
12577820	12582780	it fucking punches home because there's a lot of weight there. The problem is that that's not
12582780	12588060	necessarily an expression of his toxic community attacking people. It's the respect that he's
12588060	12592940	gained from his community that when he's willing to levy a criticism, his community goes, okay,
12592940	12597260	that's gotta be fucking right then. That's the issue. That's what's really going on that I don't
12597260	12601900	think they've like sussed out the like nuance within there of like what's going on. And the
12601900	12609260	issue is that what if he's right most of the time, right? It doesn't feel nice to have certain
12609260	12613980	criticisms levied against you, but I've never heard him make a criticism against Max or Lav
12613980	12621100	that wasn't very legitimate. So. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm on board with what you're saying. Yeah.
12622220	12627660	Failing me on the steel man, man. I mean, it's, it's kind of hard at this point.
12627660	12629580	You're like, I can't steal mountains out of you. Okay.
12630380	12634380	Like the, the, the best steel man that I could think of is that maybe,
12634380	12638860	maybe max thinks that destiny is way more responsible for the actions of his community
12638860	12642620	than he does. And so max is coming in and saying, you need to stop your community from doing
12642620	12646460	this. But even then, like, I don't even agree with that point of view. So
12649020	12653500	it's, it's hard. It's hard. It's hard this time. Yeah.
12655260	12659820	And every time I saw a false narrative, there was like a point in time where it was almost
12659820	12662700	the case that like Anna publicly had like redeemed herself. Like we were on like a panel,
12662700	12665740	everything was chill. Everything was cool. And then she like, and then she keeps,
12665740	12666780	and then she just keeps looping. But
12666780	12673260	he just wanted to drop that bomb and leave. True. I wonder if he's gonna have any luck getting of
12673260	12677020	the, any of the other fucking 20 girls that he's trying to contact to flip against me. Jesus.
12679820	12681900	He literally does not know that everyone saw the entire history of Anna. Yeah.
12681900	12683500	The problem is that he thinks that she is a,
12683500	12686780	that she has a bad reputation in my community because of me, but that's not the case.
12686780	12688860	Like I literally banned all mentions of like talking to her loops,
12688860	12691420	reacting to her loops or anything like that. Yeah. For the most part,
12691420	12693100	like we didn't talk about her except for whenever she would go like on her,
12693180	12694060	like crazy loops or whatever.
12700460	12701580	I'm trying to think if I should read any of the.
12704700	12707180	This was some of the messages that he was sending to other people. If Anna gives me permission,
12707180	12709260	I can prove that almost everything Destiny said about her is a lie.
12712060	12715260	He's mentioned to people, I have to move fast because Steven is in full attack mode on me.
12715260	12718700	When I haven't attacked him at all on stream ever, I think he's just mad because I'm reacting
12718700	12722540	to his videos where he's talking to lab about me. Oh, this is where he paints out the,
12722540	12726940	this is the, uh, this is the destiny pattern. One bring on female orbiter, two fucker,
12726940	12729900	three trash her with the community and four discard her. I would like to stop this from
12729900	12732540	happening, but I don't think I can do it unless Anna is willing to come forward.
12732540	12736780	Oh, this is the shit Max does is what he said. He feels some sort of way. He's mad because
12736780	12740540	Destiny's not defending him. He got banned from his Reddit and he feels like because
12740540	12743980	destiny won't defend him, that he can't be on destiny stream anymore. And that hurts him
12743980	12748300	because he's like, this is my friend. And I feel very hurt. And now he's creating this
12748300	12753820	massive narrative. See what happened to me is happening to all the other girl. I'm just
12753820	12757820	like every other girl here. You know, I have a good relationship with him. You know,
12757820	12762060	we get really intimate and close and then I disagree with him once. And then he did six,
12762060	12765500	his attack dogs on me. And then he kicks me out of the community. And it's just like,
12765500	12769580	none of this shit fucking happened. There's all your feelings. And now you're turning your
12769580	12776700	feelings into a fucking moral crusade. Gross. It seems it, yeah, it seems, Hmm.
12778940	12785900	Hmm. I'm trying to kind of process this in my head a little bit because
12787660	12791900	it's going to sound very strange and probably very wrong, but I think I'm correct.
12793180	12799580	Like everyone does this to an extent. You know, it's if the ultimate black pill,
12799580	12807340	the purest form black pill is that all evidence is ultimately just an argument from authority
12807660	12810700	because you weren't there and you don't know. You're hoping that the university that you get
12810700	12816220	your study from is legit. You're hoping that the report of this video wasn't completely faked.
12816220	12819900	You're hoping like everything is an argument from authority. Do you trust the source that
12819900	12823180	has sent this to you? Unless you've experienced it, it's an argument from authority. That's the
12823180	12829980	ultimate black pill, the ultimate skeptical position. And Max is doing like an emotional
12829980	12837260	version of this, if that makes sense to you, where. Because he feels a way that's the reality
12838060	12841820	and there's no and there's no room for for anything else.
12844140	12849980	Yeah. Yeah, there's no it's yeah, it's just him in his position, right? It's like that moral,
12849980	12854060	yeah, that moral and intellectual righteousness. I mean, I was like looking at like his fucking,
12854060	12858700	I don't know if you ever saw his tweet that he made when he was declaring war, but he like,
12859260	12863260	it's like, I don't I don't know what the fuck has happened, but he like basically is like,
12863260	12868300	if people watch my work and they don't get me, it's because they're intellectually inferior
12868300	12873980	or they're too afraid to dive into this stuff. And my fans, they're like my little knights.
12873980	12877580	They're my little knights who get me and they and they creep into all the other discords and
12877580	12882220	Reddits and they explain me because they see me. And now my knights are getting banned and killed
12882220	12885900	left and right. And so there's no one left to defend my name. And it's like, why do you need
12885900	12891820	to be defended? Like, why are you entitled to this? You literally said parasociality is bad
12891820	12895660	and you're calling your fucking fans, your little knights who get you and protect you.
12895660	12900460	Like, what the fuck? I don't even understand. I don't even disagree with his I even disagree
12900460	12905260	with his like view of parasociality. But like, holy fuck, for somebody who's so anti parasociality,
12905260	12907900	what the fuck are you doing? Mobilizing your units like what?
12909900	12915820	Raising. I was only like 75% saying what I was trying to say. I think I have the rest of it.
12916380	12921420	Like, oh, fuck, what was the name of the guy? I can't remember the name of the guy.
12921420	12926220	It was a philosophy paper 2009 Sargon and Taftage have both talked about it before and sent it to
12926220	12933660	me. I forget the name. I know the idea. The idea is that all of morality based is just simply what
12933660	12939740	feels good. Not not feels like pleasurable. I mean, like, feels what is the good, you know,
12939740	12945340	like, if you're taking a moral position, if you boil it down, it's just going to be your moral
12945340	12949580	intuitions. And that's it. It's not Jonathan Haidt, but it it's kind of it's kind of similar
12949580	12955580	to his ideas. And so like, you get like, you get, let's say, more on the left than the right,
12955580	12959020	you get people who say it's who say that they're consequentialists. Sorry, cons,
12959020	12965100	consequence, Jesus Christ, consequentialists, where they're only interested in consequences
12965100	12969980	and not and not rules. No, does this create good ends? That's my moral system. And it's like,
12969980	12974700	well, no, it's not because how do you judge what makes a good and good? And that's just going to
12974700	12982860	boil down to how you feel. Right. So you might have a consequentialist, socialist atheist living
12982860	12987420	in the West, who says we shouldn't get we should not kill gay people because killing gay people is
12987420	12993260	bad and wrong. And that's a bad end. And then you might have a consequentialist, you know, ISIS,
12993260	12997500	radical Muslim living in the Middle East, who's throwing gays off rooftops. And you ask him,
12997500	13002300	Well, what are you doing? He says, this is a good end. Because in terms of my moral framework,
13002700	13010380	more dead gay people is moral for me. So even even the the way of calculating morality already
13010380	13020300	presupposes a huge amount of normativity. And, and so you get to a point where if all of morality
13020300	13028860	really just is how you intuitively feel. And you just fully embrace and accept that there's no way
13029580	13035820	to like, argue a person like this out of their position. Because it's, they're gonna be like,
13035820	13039180	I don't feel that. You say, you say, Well, hold on, this is this is bad. He goes, I don't feel
13039180	13047660	that. You're wrong with this. Well, I don't feel that. You know? Yeah. And it seems like maybe
13047660	13054300	maybe Max has taken some very strong black pills on the moral question. Yeah, I can't I can't
13054380	13061100	decide is like moral framework, because it it feels like because I agree that most people do
13061100	13065580	kind of what you're saying. I think there are rare exceptional people who really do try to
13065580	13070060	think about moral frameworks, and they do their best to hold themselves to it despite how they
13070060	13074620	feel in that moment. Right. And I find those people incredibly respect worthy because they're
13074620	13079740	decently rare. And it's hard to do yourself right. Like deplatforming is bad until all of a sudden
13079740	13083020	you fucking hate that fucking piece of shit and you want them deplatformed, right?
13083900	13087100	Doxing is bad until fuck you just want to dox them to fucking get back at them.
13089980	13094540	And I think this is the issue is like, I don't know if Max has a moral code, but he claimed to
13094540	13099420	have really important ethical principles that he lived by. And the problem is that I feel like he's
13099420	13104700	just lied or given up on them. Or he's like post hoc trying to like rationalize that he's still
13104700	13111020	operating from within them. I'm not really sure. Well, I think he still does. But I think what
13111020	13119900	those what those that moral code is, is basically just what he intuits as right without any sort of
13119900	13126700	like actual rational processing behind it. Yeah. It's like, oh, my gut says this is bad. So it's
13126700	13132380	bad. And to him, it's objectively bad, because his gut tells himself. And to be fair, that's
13132380	13138620	how a lot of people do this sort of thing. I mean, that's how I do this sort of thing. And
13138620	13143740	I think it's I think it's normal. Yeah, it's not good. I do try to think I'm a free speech
13143740	13149340	extremist. I think free speech is good, even speech that I don't like. Because I try to hold
13149340	13154620	myself to some sort of more objective standard. But even then, like that presupposes a normativity
13154620	13159260	where you care about objective standards, you know? Right. Right. Which a lot of a lot of people
13159900	13164060	say that they do, but they don't. Yeah. Yeah. And maybe Max is just more honest about it. Maybe he
13164060	13168300	just like, yeah, I don't care. I you know, my morality is that I want things to be partial to
13168300	13172780	me. Maybe that's his moral code. Right. Most people don't value. It's not even like objective
13172780	13177020	morality. It's like consistent morality. Most people seem to like not value consistent moral
13177020	13183420	reality very much like, OK, for me and not for these kind of a go to. Yeah.
13183420	13189580	If you need to go at any time, I know you said an hour and I worry that that was an hour ago. So
13189580	13195100	if you need to go at any time. That was half an hour ago. And with my the magic of wireless
13195100	13198780	headphones, I slipped out and talked to Naomi and she gave me a very stern look.
13199340	13203180	And she was like, I understand. Here, just just hold on a second. OK, OK.
13206860	13207420	Naomi.
13207420	13215820	Erudite wants to know how much longer I can go. Give me a time.
13220780	13225180	Did you hear that? No, I did not hear that she she gave me an hour.
13226620	13233660	OK, so we're good. Hey, thank you very much. I love you. She's very unimpressed right now.
13234220	13239740	Should we should we be very good? And we'll only I'm going to force you to get off in half an hour
13239740	13244460	so that she's pleasantly surprised by your earliness. Maybe, maybe. I know that there's at
13244460	13248060	least some of my viewers in the chat and they all they all know about Naomi and what she's like.
13248060	13252060	She's been on my channel a whole bunch. They know the dynamic. OK.
13252380	13264460	OK.
13264460	13267580	Oh, it was this message. He's starting the anti Mr. Girl hate train. Pretty hardcore now.
13267580	13270860	To be clear, I never even really said anything about him except for reacting to the videos he
13270860	13274780	was doing with them. This is exactly what Laff said. Yeah, because because Max's sold this
13274780	13278540	message to Laff and to Anna and I don't and probably to Shaylin, too. So like all of them
13278540	13282300	are on 100 percent the same page when it comes to, I guess, me being this like crazy manipulative
13282300	13289420	abuser or whatever. This is he keeps messaging all these people, he's like, I'm trying to,
13289420	13292380	but none of these girls are getting back to me because nobody's responding to insane fucking
13292380	13294620	shit. A lot of these people like are coming to be a message like, hey, this guy's like
13294620	13296940	messaging me asking me weird stuff. He seems to have this idea that I'm like.
13297900	13301900	Yes. So that should be if you're somebody who actually believes this narrative. No,
13301900	13304300	I think that for Mr. Girl in his mind, I think he actually believes all.
13304300	13308700	Wait a second. OK, sorry. Sorry. If you are somebody who wasn't just privileging the
13308700	13314860	hypothesis and you really were trying to figure out the the truth objective from your own
13314860	13320220	perceptions, if, you know, a dozen of the girls say, what are you talking about?
13320220	13322540	That should be the moment where you stop and think about it.
13326860	13332700	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the fact that he didn't probably shows what's going on.
13332700	13338140	Yeah. Man, I wish I could show you my DMs. My DMs are blowing up. I'm getting so distracted
13338140	13340940	because people like sending me this and this and they're like, here's this clip. Here's
13340940	13344540	the verbatim thing that you need to be aware of. And I'm like, I don't know how to play 90 chess.
13346060	13350460	Can you can you say who's DMing you or is it not a shot?
13350460	13354700	No shot. I don't want to pull anyone in that doesn't want to be pulled in. Everyone can
13355260	13360460	make public declarations on their own at their own time. Fair enough. I'm just explaining to you
13360460	13363820	because everyone probably notices me getting like distracted and me being a bad interlocutor.
13363820	13369260	And I do genuinely apologize. But there's like a couple of people needing my help with a couple
13369260	13375580	of things. So, yeah, I haven't I haven't noticed anything. It's all right. Could you say if it's
13375580	13379580	are these like streamers or personalities or are these just random people? Can you say that or no?
13379580	13384380	I'm not even going to say that. It's a whole it's a whole I'll say it's a mixture of all the above.
13384380	13387260	Understood. Yeah. Genuinely is a mixture of all the above.
13387980	13390860	So I'm extremely curious if you want to type them to me, I won't reveal.
13391820	13395260	You don't have to. You don't have to know. I'm open to accepting the information.
13396220	13402460	You're like, I'm nosy, but I won't be pushy. Yes. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I appreciate that.
13402460	13407340	But I'm going to say no. Sorry. As a fellow, nosy person. I understand, though.
13410620	13413420	I think that he really does believe because in the mind of a narcissist, you're never wrong.
13413420	13416220	He thinks that he's like the hero, like saving these people from the ashes or some shit.
13417260	13428540	Try to ask for an example of one thing they disagree on, and she paused for like a minute
13428540	13430860	before going on a tangent about gender identity that she said they probably agree on, but haven't
13430860	13434140	talked about. Oh, well, I've been obsessed with Max for months, I think so. She'll agree with
13434140	13439020	literally anything literally with anything Max says. So, you know, he's trying to do this to
13439020	13441660	come up with a podcast about you both. I don't think it has to do with the next podcast. I think
13441660	13445740	it has to do. I think the subreddit stuff like fucked his mind like really hard. Who's this?
13445740	13449340	Unless you're something super relevant. I'm sorry. I just wanted to see my first. I was
13449340	13451340	just watching some of the stream started. I don't mean to cut you off. I'll pop out. I know you're
13451340	13453900	going through some shit. Okay. Have fun, buddy. All right, bro. Stay strong, brother.
13461580	13464620	Lab on her stream said she thinks it's hypocritical for you to call Max a narcissist. That's because
13464620	13467180	she probably doesn't know what a narcissist is. I don't think that has very much people experience
13467180	13470860	in general, which is probably one of the reasons why she's so easy to manipulate, which is kind of
13470860	13476860	what Max is like. I don't really blame what kind of reason why love is obsessed with Mr. Girl.
13476860	13486620	So Mr. Girl, Mr. Girl is a person who has a lot of gravity. I think he's he's kind of similar,
13486620	13491500	actually, I think to Steven in this way. It seems like especially with women, like some guys just
13491500	13500300	have a lot of gravity for like whatever reason. You know, Max's no matter how big of a piece of
13500300	13504700	shit I think he's being, he's extremely smart. Like he's a very, very, very smart person.
13506380	13509820	He's kind of really unique in the fact that he's kind of like refreshing,
13509820	13518460	that he's so like emotionally blunt. And there's also so one thing that I really dislike when I
13518460	13523020	engage with Max that I can see other people finding it kind of attractive, maybe or enjoyable
13523020	13528380	or like intriguing is there's always this tension with him where you know that he's trying to mind
13528380	13532380	read you at all times and trying to read implications into all of your words. And so
13532380	13537340	you can't help but trying to do the same thing back to him. And I fucking hate that shit. I'm
13537340	13543180	not interested. But I definitely know some people who find that very interesting and like seem to
13543180	13548700	like to engage in that dynamic in relationships. That's like the best I can guess. I think she
13548700	13556220	feels very similar to him in that like, she's got a really traumatic childhood, like really high
13556220	13561900	trauma childhood. And he's also got a pretty high trauma childhood. So I think there's probably some
13561900	13567980	level of kinship over that as well. A lot of like she seems to be really into kind of the mind
13567980	13572700	reading type of engagement with people. And so I think she gets that a lot. I think like Max is
13572700	13577980	like probably the most extreme that I've met personally, like in like, not personally,
13577980	13583500	interpersonal interaction that does that. So if she enjoys that style of engagement, particularly
13583500	13587820	a lot, that's going to be like one of her most favorite people to go to words. That's really
13587820	13594140	different about like Max and destiny is like, destiny says exactly what he means. There's no
13594140	13598220	implications. There's nothing more than what he means. If he thinks you're because I think you're
13598220	13602780	doing bad here. He means you're literally doing a bad thing. And that is the full stop. He's not
13602780	13606860	necessarily he's not implying that you're a bad person doesn't go beyond that. Right. So that's
13606860	13612940	how Max and Destiny are very, very different. OK, yeah, I think I understand. It's just the.
13614220	13620540	You know. The I guess like every time you talk to Max, it's a struggle session, kind of.
13623260	13627900	Yeah, he's very mind fucky. He's very, very mind fucky. And I've seen very, very,
13627900	13632860	very few streamers in the space know how to manage it. And I guess some people just want to get mind
13632860	13637660	fucked. OK, I don't think you want to, but it's compelling because it's about like that. So here's
13637660	13642380	what's really compelling about Max is that he uniquely has here now conversations almost
13642380	13647340	always what people are calling the meta is fundamentally what in like existential therapy
13647340	13651740	we would call a here now conversation. And as somebody who's run treatment and therapy
13651740	13658860	that focuses on healthy, healthy, not manipulative here now conversations, they're so interesting
13658860	13663420	because they're deeply about you. And those are our favorite conversations. Right. So like,
13663420	13667660	that's why a lot of people, I think, really enjoy the Max because it's deeply here now.
13667660	13673420	And we rarely get to experience that. Right. Like I could conjure it up right now in part because
13673420	13677020	I'm trained, which is why I almost actually never engage in here now conversations on stream.
13677020	13680460	I just want to be really careful about it. Like I could conjure it now by being like,
13680460	13683420	how do you feel about me precisely like right now? Like how you felt about the fact that I
13683420	13686540	interrupted our politics conversation to like drag you into this drama? Like,
13686540	13690540	is that upsetting you in any way? That would be right. And that question you can tell it puts
13690540	13694860	pressure on you. Yeah. I'm not actually asking, but that would be an immediate here now question.
13694860	13697660	And then what he does is he decides whether you're, he thinks your answer is right. So
13697660	13702940	if you said no, he'd be like, I don't think that's true. I noticed a weird pause when I switched over
13702940	13706940	and I'm pretty sure that you actually are extremely angry, but you're too passive and
13706940	13712140	cowardly to be honest with me about the fact that you're upset that I moved on in the conversation.
13712140	13716140	Right. So that's the next thing that he's going to do here. Now conversations are fascinating
13716140	13720940	because we never do them in our culture. Yeah. I think what you're talking about, it's like,
13721740	13725340	you know, I think a lot of police might rely on them because everyone wants, it's the whole,
13725340	13728860	everyone wants to tell their story thing. So you can get, you can get a suspect talking,
13728860	13732220	you can talk them into a corner kind of thing. It's more than that because it's not just talking
13732220	13737580	about your life. It's talking about you, who you are right now in this moment. How do you feel
13737580	13741740	right now in this moment? What is the body expressions that you're having? What is your
13741740	13747580	heart feeling? What is your chest? Are your palms sweaty? Like it's very intimate and in your face
13747580	13752140	and people basically never have it. It's a very, it's a very weird style of engagement that
13752140	13758140	I've, I've never seen in any of the existential groups I've run. I've never seen a group not be
13758140	13763820	absorbed by here now conversations. Right. No, I think I understand you. Yeah.
13766140	13769900	Because Lab is one of the people that I was, Lab is one of the people that I was talking to
13769900	13773820	on a more personal level. But there's, I've always said something that like,
13773820	13776380	when I see people like turning against me, I never like fight for relationships because it's weird.
13776380	13779020	I don't want to be in some weird like manipulator game back and forth where me and Max are playing
13779020	13781980	like tug of war over the mind of like a vulnerable 24 year old. I think the thing that bothers me the
13781980	13784940	most is that Max, aside from like being like a literal rapist, like talking about like,
13784940	13787100	oh yeah, when women say no, I fuck them anyways because I know what they really want. It's
13787100	13789180	irritating that he's the one at the end of the day and then watching him manipulate and guess
13789180	13792220	who the fuck out of Lab on his stream. And like the pictures that Shaylin is drawing of him and
13792220	13794860	Max adopting her and then like him on stream trying to like pull it like, you've got to leave
13794860	13798140	Destiny's communion. I left for you. I left for you, Lab. No, you didn't, motherfucker. You left
13798140	13801500	because you got ass mad and now you're trying to suck more people into your orbit. To see somebody
13801500	13804700	that manipulative and that abusive, like I said, and I'll say this a million times, if anybody
13804700	13807020	wants to lead DMs, if they think where I'm being a manipulator, I'm being a manipulator, feel free
13807020	13809260	to do it. Go for it. Like I said, I'm usually really upfront with everybody at anything. If
13809260	13811420	I feel like somebody is like, oh, Destiny, I don't like this. Okay, fine. Then fucking leave. I won't
13811420	13817660	talk to you anymore. Like that's it. Yeah. Has Ana matured a lot off stream? From what we've seen,
13817660	13820060	she never seemed like somebody can engage on casual sex again. I think she probably can. Like
13820060	13822460	I said, me and Ana behind closed doors have been chill for literally like a year. Every now and
13822460	13825420	then she'll have a cycle on stream and then her and Kiwi farms like fucking egg each other on.
13825420	13827820	And then sometimes she'll like spam messages at me, but then like usually in a day or two,
13827820	13829740	she'll be like, oh, cause I looped. And I'll be like, okay, chill. And then it's just whatever,
13829740	13832140	like that's been more or less like the past like eight months of our conversation.
13834220	13837740	Well, I mean, that's good for her. It sounded like it sounded a lot worse before.
13841980	13847100	Leave, sex slave. What do you want? Can I say something? Sure, go for it. Okay. I just find it
13847100	13853660	incredibly abusive in the negative. The fact that he's using Anna as the foreground is battle
13853660	13856940	just for his benefit. And it's also really fucked too, because she started to message people. Now
13856940	13863820	he's using a lot of the language that he's used. Okay. Yeah. I can tell that he is like getting in
13863820	13867900	her head and like hyping her the fuck up on everything that he is saying about other people.
13867900	13873820	Yeah, exactly. And she's gone through, you know, rough shit. And this is him bringing her back on,
13873820	13877900	making her go back through, like back through everything that she's gone through before.
13878460	13881980	So this is ultra fucked up. And I don't think people are realizing how fucked up that is.
13881980	13884380	Yeah. Like, like I noticed this when she sent me this message, like a day ago,
13884380	13888220	where she's basically saying that, like, I get tons of hate and harassment from your community.
13888220	13892700	You know, this and you exploit this and you face no consequences. Big streamer news networks,
13892700	13895420	repeat your words, articles, get rid of the things you say. Like a lot of it is the same talking
13895420	13898700	points that I see max and lav and probably Shannon are like echoing. So I know that they've been
13898700	13902780	speaking to her. Oh, actually, I'm sorry. I know that I can't reveal that. I know that Anna has
13902780	13905420	been speaking to them a ton. And I know that max has been like mind fucking her a ton on a lot of
13905420	13908780	this shit. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, like she just told me right now, sorry to leave the dam from Anna.
13908780	13911340	And I just said, okay, fine. Max is telling me that you're going to go nuclear on me and
13911340	13914140	got me scared. I'm not going to go nuclear. Anna, because me and Anna don't have any problems. We
13914140	13916780	haven't had problems for literally a year. Sometimes she loops on stream about me and
13916780	13918940	it's annoying, but like I ignore it. I can just respond to it. And then like a day later, she's
13918940	13921100	like, oh shit, I looked and that's it. Boom. I haven't touched it for a year. That's it. We're
13921100	13923900	cool. Everything's been fine there for a long time, but max is like digging in and he's like
13923900	13929020	trying to like, because the problem, I think the thing that happened was after max built this
13929020	13932300	narrative of Anna, he realized he couldn't find a single other girl to reinforce the story because
13932300	13935980	it's bullshit. Um, and now he's like desperately trying to like hike the Anna shit and maybe try
13935980	13939100	to like get lab on it as well. But I don't know. That's the only thing I can think of.
13939100	13943180	And so the other thing is, this is one of, I guess, I don't know, this is me. This is not
13943180	13946540	you from your words or anything, but I feel like, like the situation with Anna was a big
13946540	13950700	vulnerability for you because it was a part of your life that was really tough. And not only
13950700	13953500	for you, but for Anna as well. Sure. Like a year or two ago when she was streaming,
13953500	13955500	like every single day talking about me and Zorka was forming whatever. Yeah,
13955500	13958060	that was fucking annoying. But yeah, but like for over a year, that's been like done.
13958060	13961500	No. Yeah. So everything's like chill now. And you and her are like on decent terms and just
13961500	13965020	talking as friends and stuff. And now he's bringing it, bringing it back to make it like go
13965020	13968220	absolutely bonkers. Yeah. I think another issue is I think somebody must've brought it up to them.
13968220	13971260	I don't know how many people know this, but it was brought up to either lab or max. Then they
13971260	13975340	brought it up on stream. And then max posted, like, was it like a hundred times in his subreddit
13975340	13980060	defending his characterization of the Anna stuff? I think that somebody can tell me if they were
13980060	13985020	watching the watching the subreddit. But yeah, max started to post a ton in his subreddit,
13985020	13989180	like attacking me, like overall the inertia. So I think that he wanted to I think that he wanted to
13989180	13991500	like bring that back up to like prove some shit about me basically. But yeah,
13991500	13997660	also something else I want to say. So him blaming you for what did he say just now? He said that
13997660	14000860	the fact that your community attacks her is because of the shit you say about her.
14000860	14004860	But Anna and I have been very friendly in the past. Like I have no personal issues with her.
14005420	14009660	The thing is I've said this to Anna directly as well. The more she speaks about it and she loops
14009660	14013980	on stream and all of that, the more your community and even other random people are
14013980	14018140	going to shit on her. So it's not what you say about her. Like, and you've stopped saying things
14018140	14021020	about her when she asked you to stop saying things about her. It's because she talks about
14021020	14024220	you on stream all the time. So like, you know, it's not even my community. It's usually like
14024220	14027580	the Kiwi farmers who she goes back and forth now. But yeah. Yeah. So it's not, I don't,
14027580	14030540	it seems like he knows, like surface, like he probably knows the situation, but he got
14031180	14035340	blaming everything on you is just, it's just bad faith. It's completely fake.
14035340	14039020	Excuse me. We do not sound the same. I don't understand.
14042780	14048220	Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. Molina from the same country. Nope. Molina sounds like women.
14052620	14056220	I just heard girl with nice sounding light feminine voice. Okay.
14056860	14061980	You sound like a baguette since we sound like, I have a, it's a big, I got a strong baguette.
14062860	14068220	I am a strong baguette French baguette. Yes. So that's why I want to say, okay.
14076700	14079740	Yeah. I don't know if there's anything else to, I don't know if there's anything else to go over,
14079740	14083660	but I don't know if Max is planning on dropping a manifesto or some shit, if that's his like
14083660	14086060	fucking goal. I know that he's getting really frustrated because in the background, he's like,
14086060	14087980	he's saying that like, none of these girls are getting back to him. He's not getting the stories
14087980	14090300	that he wants. Maybe now that it's all public, you know, if you feel like you're a woman and
14090300	14092860	you've been abused by me, or if I've been sexually manipulating you, feel free to go
14092860	14095260	and talk to Max in the background and he'll give all the publicity to your story that you need.
14097020	14101580	Yeah. Watch the Shailen interview. I don't really want to, because like I said, I'm trying to be
14101580	14104620	Shailen is more of a victim than like anything else. From what I heard, I saw people in chat
14104620	14108380	typing things. It sounded like Shailen is basically like just 100% a microphone for Max.
14108380	14111020	She's just repeating all of his exact same talking points verbatim. She's probably been
14111020	14114620	abused by him for years now. I don't know if there's anything else. I don't really,
14114620	14117180	I'm not going to sit here and attack like a victim of his, you know, for days or hours.
14117180	14119740	Like it just seems kind of shitty. Uh, but I mean, I feel the same way about lab too,
14119740	14124860	even though I had high expectations, but once you want to post logs, um, of the things that Mr.
14124860	14132140	Case is, um, and I do know that there was some kind of story about, about Shailen's D trans
14132140	14139180	arc, how max D trans her. Hmm. I wonder if that all ended up just being copium too.
14140140	14145100	Oh man, just me spitballing here, but I don't know. I'm just no interpersonal stuff gets so
14145100	14151420	messy. It's so fucking messy. And it's like, let's let, let, let's assume we take
14151420	14156220	destiny at his word and maybe Shailen is fully the victim. If she's an adult,
14156940	14160060	what's still her responsibility. Now it's really tricky because
14163100	14167580	Max is older, right? There's so many, again, there's so, there's so many of these things
14167580	14172860	that make the situation riskier, more difficult and more complicated to analyze.
14175260	14182540	Hmm. But there's an element of like, she's also choosing to stay in this relationship. She's
14182540	14187900	choosing to defend him publicly like this. She like released the tweet about cherry and stardust
14187900	14193820	like, but we don't know what's going on behind the scenes. And it's really weird that Max refused to
14193820	14201900	let her come on stream until he wanted to attack. That's me basically like, why the shift? Why is
14201900	14206380	she suddenly on stream now? I do recall him saying in the past, like, I don't want her in
14206380	14210860	this space because it's my space and I wouldn't go into her space kind of thing. I think he said
14210860	14215180	something like that. And, and also, I guess there's just the wider point of like, is it really
14215180	14219660	possible to detran someone? Like if they're actually trans to force them through some,
14220460	14223500	through some method to make them not trans, like it doesn't seem possible to me.
14226700	14228780	That's a whole other topic. Yes.
14228780	14237820	Uh, it's a good question. Um, but I do know that she said with the trans stuff,
14237820	14242940	she was grateful to him for it. So it's like, the problem is like there. Yeah. I don't want
14242940	14246700	to get into like pig pilling and shit like that. I think it's a whole other conversation that is,
14246700	14252860	uh, yeah, but I will say she does say that she loves Max, that he's not abusing her,
14252860	14256220	that she's happy with her relationship, that people are wrongfully misconstruing their
14256220	14260540	relationship, that she's grateful that he transitioned her. Those are all of her statements,
14260540	14266140	just to be clear. And there's, there's also like, there's a, there are some strange relationship
14266140	14271820	dynamics where like, I know, I know one couple personally, where the guy just hits his girlfriend
14272620	14276620	and everyone who meets them is like, what the fuck? What the fuck is this? And they're both
14276620	14281740	like, no, we're okay with this. It's like, hold on. Are you just abused into being okay with this
14281740	14285420	or are you actually okay with this? And they're like, no, we're actually, it was like, I,
14285420	14291900	I want him to hit me. And it's like, uh, what do you say to that? I don't know. I don't know what
14291900	14300700	to say to that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is, this is a really, I mean, this is where I wouldn't,
14300700	14305740	I think there's some really, really cool women I know who work with like inter-partner violence
14305740	14312540	a lot. And it's really interesting having these conversations with them about being like, well,
14312540	14318300	what do you do with somebody? So for example, a different situation, but when I was working in the
14318300	14325020	teen non-voluntary lockup, there was a couple of girls who came into our facility, um, who were
14325020	14332220	being, I would say they were functionally being trafficked, but by their underage boyfriend,
14332220	14335660	but they were saying that they were okay with it and that they wanted it and that they were
14335660	14339900	just having like an open relationship, right? This is where it gets into really dicey things. Well,
14339900	14345580	like in the case of a child, we're way more willing as a society to say, no, it doesn't
14345580	14350940	matter if you think that this is okay. It's not okay. Right. Uh, so that's a little bit more
14350940	14355180	simple to solve. But then when you talk with people who example work with like women fleeing
14355180	14359100	domestic violence, I mean, the rate of which women who are fleeing domestic violence, go back to
14359100	14364140	their partner. It makes all of these things really complicated. Like so many people when
14364140	14368940	they talk about like domestic abuse or like inter-partner relate violence or, or, and whatnot,
14369660	14373980	they try to make it sound like it's this solved thing. And it's really simple. Um,
14373980	14379340	it's not simple. It's incredibly complicated. And as somebody with pretty minimal experience,
14379340	14385260	but who's talked to lots of people, it is an insanely complex situation. There's a lot of
14385260	14390380	mind-fucking that goes on that will cause people in the moment to say that things are fine and
14390380	14395100	really feel that it's fine and really feel like they're consenting that four to five years later,
14395100	14399020	when they're out of the relationship, they're like, holy fuck, no, I wasn't fine. No,
14399020	14403740	I wasn't consenting. And it's like, which person do you listen to? Our society empirically,
14403740	14407180	we tend to lean towards the later person, but like, there's this argument of being like,
14407980	14411340	if you're in the middle of it with a person, if you're in the middle of trying to convince them
14411340	14416220	not to go back to their domestic partner, which part of them do you listen to? Do you listen to
14416220	14421020	like what you think is best for them or what they're saying is best for them? Not an easy
14421020	14428060	answer. Really not an easy answer. Um, because if you don't listen to them, you're basically saying
14428060	14432860	your agency doesn't matter as much right now, which we can do, but then we have to own from
14432860	14436860	our chest that we're willing to do that sometimes. And it feels like our society isn't quite ready
14436860	14440940	for that. Because there's so many problems with it. Yeah, sorry.
14440940	14447100	This has been an inverse effect sometimes too, where like people weren't traumatized. And then
14447100	14451820	in the future, because of a new social circle that they're in, of people who are saying no,
14451820	14455660	I think you actually were traumatized. And then they kind of like convinced themselves that they
14455660	14458940	were then when they weren't, I think the also the inverse probably happens as well.
14458940	14463980	It does. It does. And so this is the issue like with the with the girl who's being trafficked,
14463980	14469420	there's multiple staff telling her that she's being traumatized. She probably was and is.
14469420	14476940	The problem is that, so this is my view, trauma and people's life experiences, their self narrative
14476940	14483340	are theirs and theirs alone. It is not your job ever as a person who loves them to impose your
14483340	14488940	perception of their narrative onto them. You can be like, this is maybe what I think is going on.
14488940	14494060	These are some of my thoughts. But it's really important, especially in my view with trauma,
14494060	14500700	to allow people to label it trauma, if and when they're ready, and only then. And I'm so lucky
14500700	14505500	that a lot of people in my life allowed me the liberty to do that. Because like I was like 19
14505500	14509660	to 20 before I realized that there was like some pretty like not okay stuff going on in my home
14509660	14514860	when I was a child. But I'm glad that I was given the space to make that decision on my own. And
14514860	14517900	finally, like I turned to one of my friends and I was like, I remember my friend handled this so
14517900	14521740	well because she knew all of my life. And I finally turned around like 20. And I was like,
14521740	14526780	I think there was actual like, I think there was some abuse going on in my home. And she's like,
14527420	14531500	why do you think that? And then I like explained stuff that she already knew. And I was like,
14531500	14537500	that's like, that's actually really abusive. And she was like, it is pretty abusive. Yeah. And I
14537500	14543740	was like, I think that's kind of why I'm fucked up a little bit. And she was like, possibly she's
14543740	14547420	like, you know, I've been thinking about that for a while. But I think it's really important that like
14547500	14552300	you come to that realization. And it's like, I'm so grateful for that friend. She was so wise
14552300	14555340	to hear my life story about some of the shit that was happening and not immediately go,
14555340	14559580	that's abuse. Because it's like the reality is that I wasn't ready at the time that I told her
14559580	14564540	to realize that it was abuse. And by the time I realized it, I was in a space in my life where I
14564540	14569500	was trying to understand who I was. And I was ready and big enough to like handle the scariness
14569500	14575020	that is to like, look at your childhood and be like, that shit was fucked. And it's really bad
14575020	14579500	in my view to rob somebody of the opportunity to move through that on their timing.
14580460	14585660	Yeah. And then there there is also seems to be the possibility that it actually isn't abuse,
14585660	14591180	right? Like you could have, it's conceivable that you that some people have some sort of kink
14591180	14596940	relationship where, yeah, there's there's just some, you know, one partner hits another partner
14596940	14602780	sometimes. Yeah, it's and they actually are like, completely fine with it. So there's, yeah, I
14602780	14609420	understand what you're saying. Any girls and other people really don't want to reveal who
14609420	14612620	they're coming from. Because I start posting, I mean, like, if max challenges me on anything,
14612620	14615340	I'll just start leaking, because I guess who the fuck cares. And I don't think any of these people.
14615340	14623420	I don't think any of these people care. Jesus, what it really, there's like clips of like,
14623420	14627180	lab, like almost compare me to Harvey Weinstein. Oh, Jesus.
14632780	14640860	His framing on this is so crazy. Sorry, just reading through some of these DMS.
14642220	14646140	I thought you and Destiny were friends. Well, we're friends. I guess I'll just read it. Fuck it.
14646140	14648140	I stopped working with him because I think he's abusive to his orbiters. And then I found out
14648140	14652460	he's been lying about and smearing the women he fucks. And then someone told me that he said he's
14652460	14657020	aroused by psychologically tormenting women. What I guess we're friends, but he's also a sociopath.
14657100	14663260	I'd like to figure out what's going on. The thing is, my hands are always tight because I don't,
14663260	14665660	I'm not gonna reveal every single person I've had a sexual relationship with because
14665660	14668460	it's for their privacy. Like there've been quite a few for sure. But like,
14670700	14673180	there are girls that I don't have sex with anymore because of reasons. And they still
14673180	14675580	come on the stream. Everything's fine. Some of them get girlfriends. Some of them get married.
14675580	14677580	Some of them like there's plenty of girls have been on that. I've never interacted with sexually.
14677580	14679900	There's been plenty people that have blown up, but I have and haven't interacted with sexually. Like
14679900	14682460	it's just like the craziest like story in his mind. I've had issues with guys, not issues with
14682460	14688300	guys. But I guess it's kind of hard to prove a negative. Well, I don't have to prove a negative.
14688300	14693500	Actually, he would have to prove the positive. Max really ended up becoming your super villain.
14693500	14699580	Yeah, I just, I feel like I put so much out there for him. It's actually insane. I was the only
14699580	14704140	person that was willing to listen to him after the weird like shit with Vash. I steal man the fuck
14704140	14712860	out of like his like basically pro rape videos. Are you worried that Max is gonna stop? I'm
14712860	14715260	worried that I'm gonna become like a new Dr. K for him. And now he's just gonna go like full
14715260	14718620	fucking. This is gonna be what he spends the next like three months on is just basically
14718620	14726140	publishing videos about me. But here's here's something that I'm that I'm wondering, and maybe
14726140	14738460	it's it sounds a bit victim blaming. And that's that's never good. But maybe we can explore the
14738460	14747100	idea anyway. Destiny has created so many of his own villains. Yeah. At what at what point do you
14747100	14755100	think it's it's reasonable to say, Hey, what am I doing? You know that I that I've made Vash and
14755100	14759820	Hassan and now Mr. Girl and everyone else who's burned a bridge? What is it that I'm doing that's
14759820	14767100	causing this? Man, okay, this is for sure going to be a mind read. So I could be wrong. And
14775020	14777660	have you ever seen the interview with Dr. K and Steven?
14778540	14779180	No, I have not.
14780060	14785260	This is why I maintain some level of respect for Dr. K, even though I disagree with like certain
14785260	14791820	things that he does. I think Dr. K had the most accurate read of Steven within three hours that
14791820	14797260	I think I've seen anyone do, which is that they talked about this idea that basically like to
14797260	14802380	operate and function within the highly volatile, highly like, intense space that he's in, that's
14803340	14810140	so toxic. He's essentially like, closed the door to certain colors of like, essentially a human
14810140	14815020	experience in his life. And some of that is emotionality, right? The biggest driver I think
14815020	14821100	for I know this because I asked him about it publicly, the biggest motivation for him is fun
14821100	14826220	and interesting. Anything that kind of gets his gears going is what he loves the most.
14826220	14830700	And the problem is that
14834300	14844380	bad people, or unhinged people, or sometimes mentally unwell people or bad actors can be damn
14844380	14850540	interesting people. And if you enjoy fighting with people, they can be particularly interesting.
14851500	14858140	The problem is that that's not a good metric of who to trust. And so this is something I think
14858140	14862700	he would maybe not agree with me. And I think there's definitely a situation, an issue going
14862700	14870060	on that like, I don't know if he has the best metric of precisely who is trustworthy and who
14870060	14874060	is not. And I think there's a second thing that's going on. And because of his position of like,
14874300	14880620	such large amounts of fame for so long, he doesn't have to pursue friendships.
14880620	14887260	Mostly people come to him and pursue him. And this is a similar issue, actually, that my best
14887260	14892860	friend has. She's just like, she's just an incredible, she's just a really cool person.
14892860	14897020	People fucking love the shit on my best friend. Everyone wants to be her friend. And I remember
14897020	14901420	in high school, she'd have people like following her around unironically, just trying to spend time
14902060	14905980	with her because she's just like, she's just got gravity. We would always joke that she has like
14905980	14909660	crazy animal pheromones or something because people were just like drawn to her always.
14910540	14916860	And what we realized when she was like hitting major crises in her life is that she had very,
14916860	14921580	very few friends around her that were of depth and substance that she could rely on. And she
14921580	14926780	didn't even know who they were because she'd never really had to pick and pursue somebody.
14926780	14932220	She'd always had people kind of thrust upon her. And she would look at me and she'd be like,
14932220	14937580	you have amazing friendships. You have really good friends. You can really rely on them.
14939180	14944860	What's the difference here? And I was like, well, I pursue friendships. I've never ever had somebody
14944860	14949340	try to pursue a friendship with me because people think I'm a bitch when I think I'm intimidating,
14949340	14952460	whatever the fuck that means. I think that usually just means that you're a bitch and they want to
14952460	14956860	say nice things. And I'm highly disagreeable. And I've never really been a part of like
14957580	14961500	Christian girl club very well because I always want to fight with men about theology.
14964460	14967180	Well, I haven't gotten that impression from you so far.
14967180	14973580	I've grown a lot. And because of that, I always selected my friends and then pursued them.
14974620	14979180	And because of that, I could just look at the crowds of people, watch how they treated others
14979180	14983260	and go, that's a good person, and then pursue them as a friend. And that's what I did. I would
14983260	14988140	literally be like, she seems based. And then I would pick them and pursue them as a friend.
14988140	14992700	And this is my reality. I'm always really close friends with people who are insanely popular,
14992700	14998380	but nobody likes me that much. That's like Nick, too. Nick, everyone fucking loves the shit out of
14998380	15004620	Nick. But in fairness, he pursued me. That was a bit of a different dynamic. So I suspect it's
15004620	15009580	a mixture of these things going on for destiny. And if he'd like, learn to basically pursue the
15009580	15013900	friends that are meaningful, I think he would see a major offset of this. But I think that's a tricky
15014700	15018860	thing to learn and realize. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is. I mean, some of that story sounds familiar
15018860	15025900	to me just because like, I get 100 DMS a day, just just being my size. If I if I ever lacked for,
15027020	15032060	let's say, non sexual companionship, all I would have to do is talk to a fan. And they'd be like,
15033020	15036300	whenever I whenever I apply to a demon, so I was like, Oh, my God, you're actually talking to me.
15036300	15039900	This is amazing. It's like, it's not that amazing, dude. Like, I'm, I'm pretty normal guy. But they
15039900	15046380	see as amazing. And like, and sometimes I think I have Jesus, like, I sometimes have ego problems.
15046380	15050300	And I'm like, Listen, you're not actually that amazing. You got to calm down, calm down the ego.
15050300	15056540	But like, if I ever I don't, I don't, I'm at a point now, that because of having fans, I don't
15056540	15061580	need to like also pursue people, right? I can, if I want, if I want a giant room full of Yes, man,
15061580	15068620	I can have it. But I don't want that, you know. Um, so I guess I kind of empathize with that.
15069260	15073980	It sounds like it makes a lot of sense. And maybe it maybe applies to me as well on some level.
15073980	15081100	Um, there's something about me, though. So so we've hit the soft end point that you wanted to
15081100	15086540	give Naomi at 1030. All right, get out of here. I will I will leave the call if you don't. I respect
15086540	15091180	relationships and I respect hold on. Give me a couple minutes before I get out of here. Okay.
15091980	15095820	Let me give you my final thoughts. So you have two minutes to somebody in your
15096380	15100620	somebody also somebody in your chat is saying that you should go talk to Justin before he leaves
15100620	15106220	because he's putting is apparently putting a moratorium on Mr. Girl content. So maybe it's
15106220	15110940	it would be better for you to talk to him than me right now. Um, I guess thanks very much for
15111500	15118220	for talking to me. It was very fun. And I want to do it some more. Because this is a very enjoyable
15118220	15123660	experience for me. I don't talk to the side of the internet much. And I've been slowly, you know,
15123660	15130620	stepping my toes, slowly muddying dirtying your hands. Yeah, I do have one request, if you don't
15130620	15137020	mind. And you can completely say no. I'm not going to take it in any negative way. Yeah.
15137020	15142060	Because it is your show fully believe you've been extremely charitable and flexible. So
15142860	15149660	Oh, well, thank you. Um, I did an absolutely terrible job of explaining the contents of my
15149660	15154700	three forms of fascism video. And I should have looked it over. I'm gonna watch it. We're gonna
15154700	15161260	watch it. Yeah. Hold on. We're gonna watch it together. My that's your girlfriend being like,
15161260	15164540	get the fuck off the internet. Let's go on a fucking date already. Oh my god.
15165260	15172620	I guess the TLDR is I did a very poor job of explaining that to your chat. And so if you
15173500	15178220	are so inclined, I would be appreciative if you showed them the video. You don't have to,
15178220	15181020	but maybe it makes some good content for you reacting to it.
15181020	15189100	Sounds good. Okay, thanks very much. Let's talk again. Okay, anybody. See ya. Bye, everyone.
