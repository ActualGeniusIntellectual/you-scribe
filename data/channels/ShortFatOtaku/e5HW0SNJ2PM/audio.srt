1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,140
Oh, hello. Hi. Hello, friend. How's it going? Hi. So what's what's up? What's the scoop?

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,100
Scoop on which? You're in Alberta, right? What's going on over in Alberta? Uh, you know,

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:20,300
it's snowing. It's about, uh, the maximum amount of news you're going to get from Alberta.

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,340
Actually, there's really cool research happening in Alberta, but I don't know how many people

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,040
will care about that. What's the research? So I don't know if people know this, but Alberta

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:36,080
and Canada in general are some of the world leaders in research on forensic studies. Um,

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,140
most of the, most of the most commonly used like risk assessments in forensic psychology,

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:48,320
for example, have been developed in Canada and, um, we have two unique data sets being

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,200
built in Canada right now that basically don't exist on in any other part of the world at

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,200
all. Um, which is really cool. So that's kind of the most exciting news going on for Alberta

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,180
is the research game in Alberta is for like child psychology and forensic psychology is

12
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,020
fucking top notch. It's really cool stuff coming out of it, which is crazy because we're

13
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,780
such a small province and everyone treats us like we're like backwater rednecks and

14
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:20,360
we're leading in like FASD neuroscience and, uh, this new forensic youth forensic, uh,

15
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,440
data set that we have. So, so what are the two data sets? So the first data set that

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,560
I think, okay, I'm biased because I'm really, I'm on both of these projects as well. So

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,480
I'll be clear that I'm biased, but they are really unique. This is just your stuff then

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,440
not my stuff at all. I'm involved in the projects, but I'm not like the lead PI, but I'm not

19
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:48,000
the lead PI. Like I don't want to claim extra. I I'm just like, I'm just part of the studies.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Like I'll be on the papers when they're released and stuff like that potentially. But the

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,800
first one is Alberta recently released, um, the last 50 years of assessments that's been

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,240
done on every single juvenile offender in our province to, uh, one of my, uh, potential

23
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:10,680
supervisors. Um, and the amount of data we have on these kiddos is crazy because it's

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:16,560
the last 50 years. So we have, we have 50 years of longitudinal data on some of them.

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,720
We have, and the level of assessment Canada does on like offenders in general, but especially

26
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,720
juvenile offenders is insane. Like we could tell you they're grade three teacher, like

27
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,220
we have everything on these kiddos. Um, which means what we can do is there's not a lot

28
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,640
of like forensic knowledge that focuses on predicting outcomes for teen offenders. And

29
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,940
there's this big question of essentially, is there prevention work being missed with

30
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,640
teen offenders? Um, and so I'm hoping I would really like to do a study that, so usually

31
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,200
in forensic psychology, what we're trying to predict is factors that contribute to recidivism.

32
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,680
So future crime. Um, but I think we should actually focus on, we should do that too,

33
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,520
but I think we should actually focus on certain protective factors. So what predicts a teen

34
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,720
completing highest levels of education, specifically completing high school, because one of the

35
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,160
best protective factors of later life success is level of education achieved. So we know

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,160
a lot of factors that predict whether somebody is going to do a crime again, but we don't

37
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,160
know a ton of factors about what predicts if offenders are going to complete education.

38
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,320
And if they get educated, there's a much higher chance that they're going to move out of the

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,320
life of like criminality and into like a more like functional element in society. So that's

40
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,700
one data set. I mean, that data set is like, that's the piece I want to study within it,

41
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:37,400
but you can do infinite amounts of studies with this. Like we have, it's crazy. It's

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,420
crazy the amount of information we have on these teens. It's going to be like the forensic

43
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,580
data on teens coming out of Alberta is going to be just infinite. It's going to be, it's

44
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,020
probably another 50 years worth of research within it. Like there's just so much data

45
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,020
there.

46
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,840
Well, well, this isn't something that I know much about, but I mean, I have heard that

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,860
generally when it comes to at least male offenders, the best thing to do is to wait from the age

48
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,540
out of puberty, you know?

49
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,620
Yeah, that is one thing, but there is actually benefits. And for example, you can treat them,

50
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,260
depending on what kind of psychiatric conditions are going on. The issue is treating them.

51
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,500
So the more severe psychopathology, the more severe the intervention needs to be. And it's

52
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,440
really, really hard to affect, to deliver really highly intensive and effective treatment

53
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,340
for forensic people in general, but specifically like forensic teens, just because of like

54
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,860
things like resistance. So they tend to get really resistant of like therapists. So there

55
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,580
are assigned therapy hours, but they often don't engage in them. Um, and so you can actually

56
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,780
give really good therapy. There are some predictive factors, one of the best predictive factors

57
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,700
of them not reoffending before the age of 25, because that's what we really want to

58
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,100
do is can we stop them from offending before they just like get too old and get tired of

59
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,720
it, is things like education, things like hobbies and things like support networks.

60
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,660
And so, um, that's kind of the angle I want to go with my career is figuring out how do

61
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,580
we build those things for these teens so that we're giving them hobbies, education

62
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,100
and support networks that help them move away from crime before they're 25. Because if you're

63
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,460
25 and you're finally getting out of crime, you're still really fucked for getting education.

64
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,580
Like these people are not aging out and then leading, going on to lead. Like, I'm just

65
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,740
happy Dorian, middle, middle class. Like a lot of these people are going on to like live

66
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,580
in like poverty, very low class. They often are getting like very, very bare minimum jobs

67
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,740
and they're like pretty life dissatisfied. So, um, yeah, that's one thing that we're

68
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,660
doing in Alberta. That's really cool. Right. What's number two? Number two is, uh, we're

69
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,660
currently collecting the largest data set of, uh, neuropsychiatric comparisons of FASD

70
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,280
brains to normal brains, um, in a longitudinal fashion. So we're running a study. It's been

71
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,500
running for about eight years. We're going to run it for another 10, um, basically taking

72
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:01,020
in kiddos with FASD and not FASD, giving them brain scans, um, in two different periods

73
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,260
and then comparing them to normal kids that are aging in the same brackets. And then doing

74
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,900
a bunch of things like IQ testing, neuropsych testing, achievement testing, um, functionality

75
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,900
testing, behavioral analysis, testing, a whole bunch of data, blah, blah, blah. Um, so that

76
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:21,800
we can, again, start comparing functionality and whatnot between kids with FASD and kids

77
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,880
with a normal brain, because people don't know this FASD is actually one of the most

78
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,440
common forms of like, basically like brain injury and brain impairment. It's it's more

79
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:37,240
people have FASD than have autism, um, which fetal alcohol syndrome. Okay. All right. Yeah.

80
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,040
So more people have fetal alcohol syndrome than have autism, which a lot of people don't

81
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,260
realize. Um, it's about 4% in Canada. So it's really, really high. We have like no data

82
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:54,680
on them. It's crazy. 4% of kids in Canada have fetal alcohol syndrome. Jesus. It's higher

83
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,820
in like Norway, actually. Norway is a really high amount as well. Oh, really? Hold on just

84
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,540
out of curiosity. What's Russia? I assume Russia is like, I have no idea. Uh, cause

85
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,020
the prevalence rates across countries is going to really depend on if they're testing for

86
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:15,100
certain things. So I watched a crowd video recently. It's about, I think it's two years

87
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,020
old now at this point, but it was basically an analysis of Russian alcoholism and how

88
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,540
it's kind of a unique situation there because it's basically become an instant, like a social

89
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,740
institution to be an alcoholic in Russia, which is a scary idea. It's very good video

90
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,620
though, but it seems like everyone over there is alcoholic. It's just part of being a Russian

91
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,340
now. Yeah. Well, I mean like vodka is a pretty like integral part of it's I think their culture,

92
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,300
not that I can like speak too much on it, but you know, I always feel like Russians

93
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,020
refer to like vodkas, like their bread and stuff like that. So, um, uh, what it is is

94
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,540
that there's something about, I mean, it's best to watch his video, hear me on it. Right.

95
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:58,200
I think the TLDR is there's something to do with Russian history regarding the geography

96
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,780
of the area and the invasions by the Mongols and the other social institutions that were

97
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:08,700
set up in Eastern Europe. Like we're talking the medieval period that basically led to

98
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,680
every Russian government, regardless of its political persuasion, um, using cheap booze

99
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,700
as the primary way to control the population. Hmm. And that's like a thousand years of alcoholism.

100
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,740
So yeah, that's really interesting. Yeah. A lot of people don't know much about fetal

101
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,860
alcohol syndrome. Uh, especially I find a lot of Americans don't I in Canada, like when

102
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,220
I grew up, I was like very abundantly aware of it. Um, yeah, same. I mean, I'm Canadian

103
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,940
too, right? I'm over. Okay. Yeah. Where's that? When I talk to a lot of, uh, Americans,

104
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,820
for example, a lot of them don't even know what the acronym stands for, which is really

105
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:51,140
interesting to me. Um, I should look up the prevalence rate of FASD in America. I didn't

106
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,060
know the acronym, but I do know what fetal alcohol syndrome is. Yeah. Oh, okay. That's

107
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,940
fair. That's fair. Um, but a lot of people don't realize there's a bunch of people asking

108
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,220
in chat. So I'll just explain fetal alcohol syndrome. The common effects of it is the

109
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,420
most pervasive is going to be the brain effects. So it does like massive, whole-scale brain

110
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:15,020
damage to infants in, in, in the womb. Um, there are some, uh, bodily stuff that can

111
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,220
occur as well. It really depends. The symptoms of FAS is going to really depend on the amount

112
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,480
of alcohol they're exposed to. And when in development in like, like neonatal development,

113
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,500
they are when they're being exposed to the alcohol. Um, so they can have physical defects

114
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,820
on their face. There's kind of like the classic, like FASD, like phenotypic expression on the

115
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,620
face with like the flattened lip, uh, eyes that are a little bit like lower set with

116
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,860
a deeper brow that are like a little bit wider apart. Um, but some kids have FASD and have

117
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,060
none of those like physical images, but if you look at their brain, they're like, you

118
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,540
can tell, like, for example, their brains tend to be like, um, the gaps between like

119
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:58,100
the brains have big wrinkles in them forward to the smoke and, uh, the gaps that you can

120
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,580
tell how healthy a brain is, is that the wrinkle, the, the down part of the wrinkle,

121
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,660
I'm trying to describe this without using like esoteric language, the part that like

122
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,340
folds in, it should be like, it should be a really clear line and it should be really,

123
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,100
really plump kind of like brain meat flesh around it. Whereas if you look at like people

124
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,460
with like pervasive, like holistic brain damage, you're going to start seeing these wrinkles

125
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,460
getting like bigger and wider, which is queuing that like actual brain matter between these

126
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:30,580
lobes in, within the wrinkles are not present because they're not occupying the space. Um,

127
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,820
you will also see less folding in FAS brains as well.

128
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,620
Does this mean that the meme about smooth brains is technically incorrect? Cause it

129
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,260
sounds like they're getting less smooth. The more damage there is.

130
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,700
Well, the smooth brains is more of like a comparative cog thing where like the less

131
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,620
folded a brain is the less wrinkles there are the less complex the brain is. Right.

132
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,740
So like our brains are kind of like our colon where they fold in on themselves so that it

133
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,260
gives maximal surface area while taking up a very small amount of volume. So the less

134
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,140
folded the brain is the less complex it is. Right. So if you look at like less intelligent

135
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,820
species, typically you're going to see less folding in the brain. It just shows that like,

136
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,620
so like that's what people mean by smooth brains. There's like less wrinkles.

137
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,380
Right. Right. So I gotta be honest. Um, well, first of all, it sounds like you're doing

138
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:20,100
two really cool things that are a bit out of my depth. I mean, I'm, um, my psychology

139
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,220
education education comes from taking abnormal, uh, intro to psych and abnormal psych in university.

140
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,860
Okay. Nice. The only, the only reason I did that is because the professor was like, listen,

141
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,580
if you're not getting a psych degree, at least go to abnormal psych. That's where all the

142
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,220
fun stuff is. Yeah. I'm normal psych is really fun. It's where you get to diagnose all your

143
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,820
friends. But that was, that was still almost 15 years ago at this point. Okay. Yeah. I've

144
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,660
been like, I've been watching you and I've been watching Aidan Paladin and I've been

145
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:53,180
watching like some other psych people online. So I don't have any formal education in this

146
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,820
stuff. Okay. Well, you gotta be careful of psych people online, including myself. I very

147
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:02,900
much say like in psychology, there is absolutely a hierarchy of expertise and the greatest

148
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:09,180
number one thing on that hierarchy is having a data, having data behind your words. Um,

149
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:15,460
right. There's a, there's a lot of pop psych that is very bad and full of misinformation.

150
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,780
And I've been seeing more and more like tick talkers and different like psychologists starting

151
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:24,740
to like jump in social media and just like debunk really bad pop psych because it's like,

152
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,180
it's crazy how much like bad information there is on psychology. It's wild. It's when you

153
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,680
can like go to some kind of strange places on the internet and see people using evolutionary

154
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,060
psychology to talk about like why some races are inferior and stuff like that's that junk.

155
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,180
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. To be fair, there's always, there's always been like,

156
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:53,100
um, a, a scientism streak, I think in psychology, even since like, I, Oh God,

157
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,380
I don't recall who it was that said this, but there was an American psychologist,

158
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,220
or actually this would have been pre psychology, but it still would have, hold on. What, what year

159
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,380
we were talking about the slavery era. And I think psychology hadn't been formalized at that

160
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:13,700
point. Uh, psychology like really formalized with William Vunt in like 1890. So, okay,

161
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,580
this would be a bit before that, but basically there was a guy who decided to say that slaves

162
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:26,020
who wanted to be free had some sort of a, of a psych related mental problem. And he, he wrote,

163
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,340
uh, this, this would have been like the w what was it? Early 18 hundreds. Um, he,

164
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,060
he wrote some sort of literature that was all complete nonsense, but it was basically just

165
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:42,900
justifying the current political situation using, using mental health. I feel like there's,

166
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:49,460
there's probably, um, maybe, maybe not a tradition, but at least like a strain of psych

167
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,020
that probably has some bad actors doing that all throughout its history. For sure. I mean,

168
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,440
if you go to any field of science, especially any science that can be like mapped onto human,

169
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,020
like human expression existence, there's absolutely bad actors who have tried to like

170
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,620
weaponize science for like bad means. Um, and I would, so like you see the most of it in like

171
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,980
biology and psychology, um, not as much in sociology, but that's also because it's like

172
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:17,260
not a super strong science, um, in comparison, not that I'm saying like psychology is a hard

173
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,620
science by any means. Um, there's just like some level of like empirical rigor that's applied to

174
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,980
it. Um, but yeah, absolutely. There are bad actors and we have to be careful, right? Like that,

175
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,460
this is why people are afraid of IQ is because IQ was weaponized in a really, really bad way.

176
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,460
The issue is like, we don't need to solve that problem by dismissing IQ tests. What we need to

177
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:42,380
do is like prove why, for example, if they're like prove, prove why basically racist can be racist,

178
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,060
but that doesn't mean that like they can weaponize science. So like explaining things like, you know,

179
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:54,280
um, IQ isn't the same thing as moral value at all. Weird concept, you know, which our society still

180
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,300
struggles with. I mean, I, I started my pro my platform by talking about IQ tests and then I

181
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,740
realized it seems like nobody can engage with IQ tests like, well, because it's really hard to

182
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:09,500
like disentangle IQ from like moral value for a lot of people. Right. If I say like somebody,

183
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,500
if I say like somebody is less at sale, like, yeah, my one friend has like a lower IQ. Um, what

184
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,700
they hear is my friend is worse. And it's like, well, that's not necessarily true. Like say I have

185
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,020
a friend who does have a lower IQ, which I've never talked about my friend's IQ. They might be

186
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,420
super gifted in a million other areas. Like IQ is predictive of certain things and success in

187
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,180
certain areas and in areas that our society values. But I would argue, like, isn't it a

188
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:38,660
problem that we don't value other things that are predicted for outside of IQ? Um, but like being,

189
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:45,020
yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, there's, uh, there's, I think there's just a natural tendency

190
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:51,260
to have a chuckle at someone who like, okay, I'll just use an example. Okay. So, so Zander Hall, you

191
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,900
know who Zander Hall is?

192
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,620
Uh, yes. I've seen a bit of his content, not a ton, but yeah, I know he is.

193
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,860
He, he did an IQ test on, on a stream and he got like a 93 or something, which is below.

194
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,260
Okay. Well, any tests that you do that you could just do on your screen is garbage just as a heads

195
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,060
up, but also if he got 93, that is surprising because these things always inflate you by like

196
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,180
well, he got a 93 and then he turned around and said that, well, IQ isn't real anyway. And it's

197
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,980
all just, it's all just a tool of capitalism to try and keep working people down to create a class,

198
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,300
a class structure. And I was like, this just sounds like coping at this point. And it was just,

199
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,140
it was funny. And it's kind of cruel because, you know, we're laughing at a guy because of

200
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,460
intelligence, but there's also still like some, some short and fried there, especially since he's

201
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:43,260
been not very nice to me over the four years. I can have a laugh and understand that it's also

202
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:50,540
probably a little bit cruel too. Yeah. Um, it can be cruel and like our societies really do like

203
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:57,740
Mo most infrastructure in our society absolutely abuses IQ. Um, and like how,

204
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:03,580
like I'm actually extremely quiet for your audience. Oh, really? Oh, bumpy guys. Even

205
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,380
more. Can you hear me? No, I'll bump you up even more. You're at 148. I'll bump you up to 200.

206
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,180
Oh, well, sorry. Hold on. I can, maybe I can do something on my end. Just me.

207
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,060
If you like. Yeah, no, no, please. If they can't hear you, then this is a one-sided conversation.

208
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,740
And then everyone's I saw a couple of like, this is awkward. And I feel like maybe that's,

209
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:25,020
that's why they were saying this. Can you imagine that it's just you talking to yourself actually,

210
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,940
and they couldn't hear me at all. That would be kind of awkward. I'm not going to lie. So

211
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,220
you're way louder for me, but I'm checking your decibels on my thing and it's not higher,

212
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,660
but everything on my site is maxed. I gave it a short nudge on my audio interface here.

213
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:47,980
I can give it another short nudge. Well, I'll watch the chat just in case they, um,

214
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,180
your voice is a little distorted now. So it's, it hasn't bumped up in volume. It's just kind of

215
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,540
distorted your voice. Like it's like peaking really hard now. So you can probably drop it

216
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,900
down. You're staying at the same decibel now. So you can probably drop it down a little bit.

217
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,140
It sounds like people are saying it's okay. Um,

218
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,820
yeah. Okay. Here's, I'll turn down the game, but I'll turn up the level. I think. Okay.

219
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:10,960
Okay.

220
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,620
Because game like affects the sound that your mic takes in and level just

221
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,580
takes that sound afterwards and then boosts it.

222
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,140
Um, thank you cowboy Christ for letting people know about FAS. It is called both technically

223
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:35,980
FAS is fetal syndrome, but yeah, you sound good. Let's do a couple more tests.

224
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,020
Test, test, test. Hello. Yeah. You're pretty good. You're a little peaky still,

225
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:47,180
but it's okay. It's not the end of the world or clipping or something. I'm clipping. All right.

226
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,660
No Dev that he's dummy thick. Yeah. I know. I mean, fat's in the name, right?

227
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,900
Yeah. Isn't it? I love when you get insults about things that you're like, I like, I don't know how

228
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,820
often to get insults like that, but I'll often get insults. It'll be like using the not so like,

229
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,340
they'll be like, not so smart indeed. And I'm like, good one. Like it's kind of implied with

230
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:19,100
the name, but go for it. King go off. So I guess the, the quick TLDR and who I am for your audience

231
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,620
since, I mean, we just talked for like five minutes, but I might as well act like we just

232
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:34,300
started. Yeah. So I started in 2009 on YouTube and wow. The, the name short fat otaku was because

233
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:40,300
it was me and my friends. And we were younger goofing around with a camera making like channel

234
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,940
awesome style, anime videos, rather than cause channel awesome had people doing games and people

235
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,420
doing movies, but not really that many anime people. And I liked anime and my friends like

236
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:54,620
anime. So we're going to do an anime show and we did that for a bit and we had like a few viral

237
00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:01,660
hits, but in 2009, you're not really making a living on you. This is pre-patron. So, but you

238
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,940
know, we got like, you know, the first video we put up got like a quarter of a million views,

239
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,380
which is a lot back then. And it was like, oh shit, maybe we can actually make this work.

240
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:14,380
But there was no money in it. And also copyright strikes back then were just your video got

241
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:21,180
deleted. There was no appeals process. Oh, wow. It was. Yeah. So it was hard to actually kind of

242
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,660
keep the momentum going on the channel. Yeah. And also like we were going off to university

243
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:32,540
and we kind of had things to do that were, you know, real life things. And we tried to do like,

244
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,940
let's place and we did less plays a couple of years and those were actually more successful.

245
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,860
I turned those into a side channel where I do like gaming content on the side and I still get like

246
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,020
100 viewers whenever I stream over there, like 50 to 100. It's pretty good. It's a nice little

247
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:52,140
side hustle. But gamergate came along in 2014. And I was like, maybe I should, you know, toss my hand

248
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,500
into the online politics ring. And I did that. And that's when the channel really started growing.

249
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:05,900
And so, you know, I did some videos that had some traction. I got a shout out from Sargon in like

250
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:11,820
2018. And that gave me like 40,000 subs. And I got to a point where I could I could like quit

251
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,660
my job. And so I was like, maybe I should know to talk time. And I've been doing that for maybe

252
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:22,700
a year and a half now. Wow. That's crazy. Yeah. Living the dream. At least for me, it's it's my

253
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:29,100
dream. So like, so you're full time full time now, like you're able to basically afford life.

254
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:37,980
I'm full time. And I also have employees who really made it. Yeah. One full time editor. And

255
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:45,020
then my girlfriend also pitches in. She's she's part time, though. Okay. The goal is to eventually

256
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:50,460
like, hire all my friends and just spend our days having fun. Hmm. So that's the goal.

257
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,260
I'm so curious now that you've been because you've been in the space way longer than me. And I know

258
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,020
kind of obviously I'm stealing this directly from Devin Nash. But I always hear that there's

259
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,300
kind of two major like forms of monetization that you can pursue as a content creator,

260
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,180
which is maximize views, maximize numbers of like subscribers and everything and assume that

261
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,340
a very small percentage of them will give money and they'll give a very small amount of money.

262
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:19,980
Or maximize like a niche have a lot less people. But those people give a lot more money in total

263
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,060
because they like really value the niche content that essentially that you're providing. Do you

264
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,740
think that you're catering to one or the other?

265
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,580
I don't know. I haven't thought about it like that. I've, I have always treated my channel as

266
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:40,860
a personal project that I never expect to make any money on. I just so happen to. So that's why

267
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,820
there will always be like, sometimes there'll be a conflict. It's like, listen, this is the

268
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,020
video that I feel like making today. This is the stream that I feel like doing today.

269
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,300
And some people are like, well, that's not what I wanted to see today. Well, it's like, okay,

270
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,620
well, you can come, you can come by tomorrow then. But like, I've always kind of put my own

271
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,220
interests first and the audience second, as selfish as that kind of sounds.

272
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:04,300
Because I realized that like, if I faked it, it just wouldn't be very good. You know, if I,

273
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,460
if I talked about a topic that I don't really care about, but it's the big thing right now,

274
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,500
I think it would just, it would, it would be shallow and it would be,

275
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,100
I wouldn't care. And it would, it would, people could tell the audience could tell that I didn't

276
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,860
care. And it would just, you do that too much and you lose everything because then it's like,

277
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:26,540
oh, this guy's just solid, you know? So I don't really look at my numbers that much.

278
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,900
I don't look at my like, oh, did this video do better or worse? You know, I don't really watch

279
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,540
that too hard. It's probably, it's actually probably to my detriment that I'm not data driven

280
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:42,460
on, on YouTube, but I feel like I might end up destroying myself if I try to.

281
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:49,740
Yeah, I mean, I try to never look at numbers at all. I like, let my editor do that almost

282
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:56,700
exclusively. Because it's just like, yeah, it's just not a, not a good situation if I do. I'll

283
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:03,580
get obsessive for sure. Yeah, I can definitely, you know, I do like, at my size, you have to at

284
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:09,500
least sometimes. But I can tell whenever I go into the analytics panel, I can like, feel the itch

285
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,260
in the back of my brain. And it's like, okay, I can't spend more than a few minutes here just

286
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,900
to do what I need to do. And then I need to get out of here. I can't just watch these numbers for

287
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,100
like the next six hours. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no, I agree. You just get in your head. And like,

288
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,780
the problem is that yeah, if you're making content that you feel like obliged to make,

289
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,860
I feel like the content quality necessarily goes down, which like hurts the wallet,

290
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,060
but also is like kind of disappointing your viewers, which is like, why you're kind of

291
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,580
doing this. And there's like this very weird inverse relationship that you can have with it.

292
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,820
Mm hmm. So Artemis Fowl is somebody who watches me quite a bit. He just sent you a $5. He said,

293
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,340
This is money I would give to SFO, but he's Canadian. Erudite's Canadian.

294
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,060
Yeah, that's true. It's still going up north, man, no matter what you do.

295
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:58,300
That fucked up. Oh, no. This is money I would give to SFO, but he's a Canadian.

296
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,660
He's a nice guy. He's a bit autistic. I've talked to him a few times. He's kind of nuts.

297
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,980
He's been on my stream a few times. And I always

298
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,300
an autistic person online. That's crazy. There's no neurodivergent people online.

299
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:16,780
I've hosted Artemis Fowl, who's very libertarian versus Econoboi on economics. And that was a shit

300
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:21,820
show of a stream. Was it? My God, it was fun. It was really fun. Because like, they both seem

301
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:27,900
to be pretty educated and pretty intelligent people. But they, they hard disagree. And it

302
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,260
was like, Oh, okay. And then I'm just kind of sitting there watching sound really know too

303
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,660
much. I got a little bit of economics. I took intro, but like, my university career, by the

304
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:40,940
way, is like intro in every single field. Did you get a degree? Did you ever get a degree or

305
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:45,180
I did? Yeah. But I took like, I took seven years to get a four year degree.

306
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,580
Oh, wow. So what what is your degree in English literature?

307
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,780
Wait, you generalized on everything. And then you settled on English lit. How the fuck? I feel like

308
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,860
that is not not the direction I would expect. Why did you settle on English lit?

309
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,780
Um, cuz I liked it. You know, yeah, a lot. Yeah, like, it's the same as my YouTube channel,

310
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:14,460
I found that like, okay, so, you know, I miss people going to university. And I understand

311
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,540
why people don't do this, because university has just become like the bare minimum for most jobs.

312
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,260
But I wish we had a university system where people just went into things because they wanted to

313
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:31,020
think Artemis and they wanted to be researchers. Thank you for making fun of Artemis publicly and

314
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,380
loudly. Appreciate that. He is also one of my guys, too. I did I did an ad everyone on my

315
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,420
Discord to annoy everyone to get them all. Oh, wow. I was telling my chat that you and I've been

316
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:48,620
like, DM friends for quite a while. I know, but we've never chatted publicly. It's crazy.

317
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:54,940
So I so I started watching you because of destiny, which is probably a story you've heard a lot.

318
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,940
What? You found me the destiny? No way. Oh, my gosh. Hashtag orbiter life.

319
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:07,020
Um, I'm in DGG chat a fair amount. He gave me a shiny checkmark covering capacity. It was actually

320
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:12,860
me chat. And I don't I don't pop out. I don't I don't have a discord permissions to actually

321
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,900
jump on the streams at all. But I watch. And, you know, it's been pretty interesting conversations

322
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,220
until like the current orbiter arc that just seems to be pure fucking cancer right now.

323
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,820
So I'm not watching right now. But I've watched a fair amount now for about a year.

324
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:34,460
So I was like, Oh, great, erudite. She seems really cool and interesting. I'm gonna go check

325
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,660
out her stream since since destiny is not online right now. And I go over to your stream. And

326
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:45,580
you're watching one of my videos. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then you're like, now, guys, this is not a very

327
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,740
good video. But there's at least a nugget of truth in here that we should probably consider. And I

328
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:58,620
was like, Oh, okay. I don't know what that means. I was amazing. What video was that? I was calm,

329
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:05,580
reasonable and centrist in my opinion. It might have changed a few views since then. It was old.

330
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:11,340
Thank you. Artemis again. Artemis is shit talking him. Of course he is. Yeah, I was amazing on the

331
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:17,020
election and I was calm reasonable centrist in my opinions economy. That's fair to kind of boy.

332
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:22,940
Um, I was a nice guy. I disagree with him a lot. But he's a really nice guy. I've enjoyed talking

333
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,620
I've talked to like four times now. He's great. Yeah, he's got a pretty big brain,

334
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,340
a pretty big brain for economics. And I've learned a lot from him.

335
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,420
See, if I go to your page, I wonder if it'll just like, I'll be able to see like, which one is got

336
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,820
a view bar on it. I talked about Mass Effect in it. It was like a video game oriented.

337
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:46,060
It was like, it was something like, the right in the 90s was censorious, and the left was free

338
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:50,700
speech. And now things have switched around on the on its head. It was a video kind of about that.

339
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,780
Because I talked about like, Jack Thompson, if you know who he is, he was like a politician in

340
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:01,340
the US who wanted to get video games banned. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I talked about like the

341
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:07,980
the Mass Effect controversy where in 2007, Mass Effect comes out and you can play as a human lady

342
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,820
and have a lesbian sex scene with a with a blue alien lady and you can see like a blue bum

343
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:19,820
for a few seconds in the game. And so Fox News back in 2007 stirred up this big controversy

344
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:24,700
about it and how it was it was the degeneracy that was destroying the youth of today was in video

345
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:33,020
games. I love blue bums. Yeah, did you play Mass Effect? Are you a gamer at all? Ah, I play games.

346
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:38,700
I don't know if anyone would honor me with the title of gamer by any means. Okay. Yeah.

347
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:45,740
Well, it actually came out because they did a remaster of the Mass Effect trilogy last winter,

348
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:51,100
I think. And it came out in the hype to the release of that, that because of the Fox News

349
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,620
backlash towards the lesbian sex and Mass Effect one, they took a character in Mass Effect two,

350
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,260
who was very clearly a lesbian or at least bisexual, a very butch character.

351
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,140
And they had recorded voice lines with the actors for a lesbian romance option and,

352
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,620
and they took it out. They took it out. And they had no gay sex in Mass Effect two because they

353
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:17,980
didn't want any backlash from Fox News again. Damn. Well, damn outshot by the by the Christians

354
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,180
back when Christians used to be the ones who are censoring people. Yeah, the old religious guard

355
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:28,300
and now we have a new religious guard. So yeah, the video is something about house like the

356
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,260
censorious nature of politics has inverted that I think about that. And you had some kind of

357
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,180
problem with it. But I remember the problem. I can't remember at this point. I can't remember

358
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,580
either. It was like six months ago. I'm sure I felt very strongly though. And I hated you in that

359
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:48,780
moment. Oh, yeah, yeah. But that was that was like a 2019 video, I think. And I might have changed,

360
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,860
I might have been softened on opinions or change things since since then. But I mean, I still think

361
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,820
that the general thesis is the same, that I think the left right now is pretty censorious. And it's

362
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:03,020
probably not good for us. Because I'm, I'm in my 30s. At this point, I remember an era when the

363
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,940
left wasn't that. And that's why I called myself a leftist. And now I don't call myself a leftist

364
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,540
because I don't like where things are going.

365
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,660
Yeah, plus the left is kind of hate you. Although the right hates you too. So

366
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:21,340
yeah, oh, yeah. Both of them hate me. It's great. So I've, you know, Vashj has called me a fascist

367
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:27,180
at least once on the stream. And I do know, the serfs have done the same, you know, Lance over

368
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,260
pretty much all the bread tubers. I don't come up often, so I'm not that big of a figure. But

369
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,460
when I do come up, it's like, Oh, he's that fascist guy. And it's like, Oh, all right.

370
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,340
Where's the right call you?

371
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:41,820
Communist. Okay, because I'm, for me, I'm just like, Hey, you know, I don't mind a universal

372
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,340
health care service in the government. It's probably a decent use of tax dollars, guys.

373
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,540
And they're like, Oh, so you're a redistributive commie cuck, who wants the state to just give you

374
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:59,260
handouts? It's like, All right, guys. All right. However, I was just gonna ask, what do you think

375
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,980
is your least popular take with the left? Where do you think we would most disagree?

376
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,780
You and I will do you consider yourself a leftist?

377
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,100
No, I've never been a leftist.

378
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,400
No.

379
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,020
I mean, I thought I was a leftist when I was in normie land. Because I'm quite progressive.

380
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,860
But then I realized that on the internet, I'm at minimum, I'm probably a moderate progressive.

381
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,980
Yeah. Yeah. So I've heard a lot of people say you're a liberal, not a leftist, right? When

382
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:31,420
you talk about like, people who aren't socialists. Yes, like, fair enough. Yeah. And if that's the

383
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,420
definition, fine, I don't have any emotional attachment to the label of left, I will take

384
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,180
the centrist position. I'm okay with that, you know. As for what you and I disagree with, I'm

385
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,700
not sure. Um, I've watched a fair amount. I think I've watched more of yourself than you've watched

386
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:49,980
mine at this point. So I'm not sure. Yeah, I'm a bad consumer of content. I need to do it more.

387
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,980
I get stressed, though. I don't I get stressed watching other people's content. Because every

388
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,260
time I watch somebody's content, I'll be like, man, they do this really well. And then I'm like,

389
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
oh, fuck, I'm not doing that. I need to be doing this.

390
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,100
Oh, I feel the exact same way with everyone that I watch. Oh, oh.

391
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,500
So it's a problem. I literally like some people's streams. I can't like watch sometimes because I

392
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:16,860
whole time, I'm just stressing about like, where they excel, which is the most self focused thing

393
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,260
you could ever do of being like, I know, I'm trying to watch my friend make content here.

394
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:28,140
But gosh, I feel insecure. Like it's so late. It makes me so bad. But I'm always doing this balance

395
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,100
of like, yeah, but I also need to be like, mentally healthy. And I have a lot of work

396
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,300
to do as well. So like, how do I how do I juggle all these fish? I don't know.

397
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,860
I know what I did, because I feel the exact same way. I got to a point where I'm just like, okay,

398
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,900
so what can I learn from this, and I become more analytical. And now it's like, okay,

399
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,460
I've, I've taken enough criticism over the years that now I'm just in the pure, like,

400
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,500
okay, how do I improve mode, you know, I'll watch something, I'll be like, oh, I should do this.

401
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,380
I don't like, I don't beat myself up nearly as much.

402
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,020
Okay, I'll do it found you through destiny a while back. Subscribing.

403
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,420
I think you are more interesting than destiny in many ways. Much love.

404
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:13,340
Oh, okay. So you also, however, watched my three forms of fascism video.

405
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,460
That was my most recent magnum opus. That's been like a year in the making.

406
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,380
Yes. And you got in a lot of trouble for that. I heard.

407
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,180
Wait, did I?

408
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,220
I thought you said that the right came out and just was fucking were we talking about

409
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,020
how they were attacking you?

410
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:32,620
I actually forgot that it happened so often. I have like a new because Okay, so for example,

411
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:37,340
since that video came out, let me just quickly see because it's been a little bit. I did.

412
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:46,220
I'm in my back end right now. Where's that video? Okay, so since then, I did my our trans woman

413
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:53,420
actually woman video. And my answer to that was like, mostly no. However, I did leave like the

414
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:58,540
door open for like a tiny yes at the end. And that got a lot of right wing people kind of angry.

415
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:03,820
Um, I did. I did a video on where is it? Where is it? Where is it?

416
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,620
I did a video on the mega republicans. You know how Biden did that speech,

417
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,620
like two months ago, where he was like, the mega republicans, they want to overthrow democracy.

418
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,380
Yeah. And the right got really good.

419
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,900
And he had like the red background and people like clicked it. So he looked like an evil

420
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,780
Sith overlord.

421
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,900
Yeah, yeah. So the right got like highly offended at that. And I was like, I'm going to examine this

422
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,300
and actually look into it. Yeah. And what I found is that, you know, from an outsider's point of

423
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:35,260
view, he didn't say anything too bad. However, if you filter, if you like, put yourself in the

424
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:43,740
shoes of a rightoid, and try to examine it from there, from what I don't, there's probably a

425
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:51,660
worldview. No, no, no, no. It's worldview, but it's more than that. It's that a, when you hold

426
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:57,100
the belief, it never feels like a belief. It just feels like the way the world is. Does that make

427
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,460
sense? Yes.

428
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:05,500
So if you were to say, hey, you know, rightoids have this belief, but to them, it doesn't feel

429
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,340
like a belief. It feels like reality. So you have to like, really say, okay, what they believe is

430
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,660
the truth. And so and so they kind of reorient your brain for a few minutes and be like, okay,

431
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,500
so the right wingers actually think the election was rigged and stolen from them. And that January

432
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,780
6th was a populist uprising against a corrupt government, desperately trying to take back

433
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:31,900
democracy, and it failed and it was put down. Okay, so put yourself in that headspace. And

434
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,980
now listen to what Biden's saying. And it sounds extremely scary.

435
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,100
Now, I don't agree with them, by the way, just so we're clear here that I'm not, I don't believe

436
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,340
that the election was stolen in 2020. I'm not one of those guys. But I've talked to a lot of

437
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:54,700
people who believe that. And I've, I've tried to like, understand their point of view, try to make

438
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:03,100
them understand my point of view. And a lot of them are extremely frightened. So when I made

439
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:09,580
that video I went through, I'd saved up since 2017, a series of events where left wing people

440
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:14,620
had been physically attacking right wing people, just for wearing a mega hat. And I had like half

441
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,100
a dozen of them, where you see people coming up to like one guy, I know Stardust watched this video

442
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:24,620
on her stream. And she, she was surprised at how much of this violence was going unreported in the

443
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:29,340
mainstream media. One guy in New York, he's an Asian guy who he owned an art gallery in New York,

444
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,340
he had a mega hat on just walking around town. And a crowd of people came up and just beat the

445
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,180
shit out of him. He had a broken eye socket, his eye was like all red and bloodied, and his face

446
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:41,500
was swollen up to like double the size of what it normally is, it was pretty, it was a pretty brutal

447
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:47,500
attack. And you, on right wing media, you see this all the time, right? If you go over to parlor or

448
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:53,180
getter or whatever, you're gonna see another leftoid has attacked a mega patriot. And you're

449
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,420
gonna see a picture of like a guy who's like, like all bruised and bloodied up. And these are

450
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,060
real attacks. Like, you know, a week before the election, the midterm election, a Republican

451
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,300
candidate got his house shot up. And no one mainstream you talked about that, like that,

452
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,220
that went completely under the radar. But this guy had his family at home. And, you know,

453
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:15,260
the FBI investigated it was it was some deranged leftoid went did a drive by on his house. No one

454
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:19,420
said a thing about it. Oh, this is the problem with this. This type of criminal type of

455
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:25,260
conversation is right on one side, we're only hearing air at night. Do you believe that

456
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:33,820
conservatives view the repeal of Roe v. Wade as progressive? I see what I see when the left is

457
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:39,100
victims too. Yeah, I was gonna say is interesting, right? Is that the conservatives will look at

458
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,220
this and be like, See, look at all these crazy things happening. And I'm like, Okay, but if I

459
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:47,740
just literally I just googled transgender woman attacked. And I can also find just like stories

460
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,860
from like, a month ago, three days ago, two months ago, two days ago. Yes. Right. And so it's like,

461
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:58,700
the issue is like, all sorts of crime is going on all the time, all the time. And just to be clear,

462
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,260
it's all bad. I grabs back a fucking obviously. And the problem is that if you have a worldview,

463
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:08,460
that's only talking about one of them, then you like because both sides feel afraid. I think

464
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:14,620
that's the issue. And the issue is I sympathize. I think both sides. I think this is a criticism I

465
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:20,220
would give of like the center is there is cause for concern. There is cause for concern. We are

466
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:25,900
attacking both of these groups. There is increasing in like violence and division. And like, the

467
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,140
institutions are really, really fucked. Like both sides are now concerned about the institution

468
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,860
integrity. And I think that there's good reason for this, right? I'm like, there's all of this.

469
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,620
And I think we have to be really careful in the center to not like do the both sides would be

470
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:42,700
like, but both sides have validity. It's like one of them probably has they might have equal

471
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,380
validity. One side might have more validity. It's really, really, really fucking hard to tell. This

472
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:53,020
is where we need like science and data. But yes, yeah, they're both afraid. And I think both sides

473
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:58,140
should be a little bit afraid. I can understand why they would be on both ends. Yeah. So so what

474
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,380
you said is completely correct. But if you were to go up to that guy who had like a broken eye

475
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,460
socket and a swelled up face and told him that it wouldn't be very convincing to him, you know,

476
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:10,220
he'd be like, I just got the shit kicked out of me simply for being a republican. What are you

477
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:18,860
talking about? And that's not an unreasonable reaction to have. So like, I watch people who

478
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,620
are much further left than me. And I watch people who are much further right than me, you know, I'll

479
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,140
watch some bread tubers that don't really like, you know, I'll watch there's there's some really

480
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:30,220
crazy people on the right that I don't really, really like, but I'll, I'll check out everything,

481
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:36,140
you know, and I see. So I made a video. And this video was basically, um, here's a collection

482
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,820
of things that I know the left has ignored, where right wing people have been legitimate victims of

483
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:48,300
crime. And I know and I know you guys know this. So we're coming into 2020. You the right has four

484
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:53,100
years of feeling like the victim and feeling like no one's listening to them whenever it whenever

485
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,980
they get attacked, whenever they get shot up whenever something happens. And now we're asking

486
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,780
them to accept Oh, by the way, you actually did lose the election. That's even though it's true.

487
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:08,860
It's a really hard pill to swallow. You know, when you have four years of victimizing these people

488
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:13,580
and then ignoring them, and then turning around and saying, Oh, yeah, even though the media

489
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:18,460
ignored all this shit for four years. Now you got to believe us when we say that you actually

490
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,620
aren't the victim this time. Like good luck getting to believe that. You know what I mean?

491
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:30,620
Yeah. Yeah. And the issue is, it's really hard. It's really hard, because

492
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,500
I, this is where I struggle with the conservatives, right? This is why like,

493
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:41,180
I don't think I'd ever fall into the conservatives is, I think, at an anecdotal level, I understand

494
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:52,540
them. All of the data I find, makes me hesitant. But then I take into mind, I'm like, I know that

495
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,220
they don't trust the institutions. I know the institutions are left leaning and stuff like

496
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:01,740
that. Not that I think the FBI is, but it's like, I understand at an anecdotal level, why people on

497
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:07,420
both sides are afraid. The issue is that it doesn't mean that equivalency is actually occurring here.

498
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,620
Keep up the good work. Fire.

499
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:16,620
Fuck, figuring out if it is an equivalency, or if there actually is one side that has a much

500
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:21,900
more legitimate claim to concern is really, is really fucking hard to tease apart. Because like,

501
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,220
for example, like I can get stats on like, increases on like crime, like there's pretty

502
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:30,540
clear stats on the increase of anti trans crime, but by the FBI, right, that's pretty clear.

503
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:36,300
If I look up like MAGA hat crime, I don't find anything, but I don't know if the FBI is even

504
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,780
categorizing those types of assaults as MAGA hat related assaults, like I don't know.

505
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,180
Like, I'll have to keep looking. But it's like, how are these things being like anti trans

506
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,420
categorization makes sense? What would they be categorizing as like an assault based on like,

507
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,260
being conservative? Are they even tracking that as like a politically based assault? Or are they

508
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:57,180
just counting that as an assault? Or they're counting it as a racial, like poverty? Like,

509
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:01,820
how is this getting categorized? And so like, a lot of these things are like super hard,

510
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:07,020
but I think like a very legitimate criticism of the sense of the moderate is that they just want

511
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:12,140
to fence it and say both sides are equal. And it's like, sometimes they're not. Sometimes there is a

512
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:17,900
there is a worst case. And it's really important. I would argue for everyone to figure out which it

513
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:24,220
is. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely agree. As somebody who does a lot of fence sitting myself, I

514
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,700
definitely agree. The issue is like, I'll talk to the right, and they'll say the same thing,

515
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,460
but for their side, right? They'll be like, Dev, you got to get off the fence. You're clearly

516
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,740
clearly the left's evil. And they're coming after us, man. And I'm like, well, I don't know about

517
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,540
that, you know, and then I'll hear people on the left say the same thing. And I'm like, well,

518
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:43,500
sometimes I don't know about that either. Or I do know, or like, I'll hear like, they're like,

519
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,420
but they're D platforming conservatives. I'm like, that's fucking true. And then like, but like,

520
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:52,380
anti trans, like sentiment is on the rise. And I'm like, that's fucking true. Like, both of

521
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,180
these things are true, right? And like, I get somebody was like, Okay, well, is D platforming

522
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,980
the same thing as being anti trans. And it's like, they're obviously not the same construct.

523
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:07,020
The issue is we have to analyze like impact. And that's really fucking hard to do. Because the

524
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,340
anti trans stuff feels at face validity as having the more impact like that feels self evident.

525
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:16,140
However, like D platforming has major major consequences that we're really only starting

526
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,860
to see that are not as self evident or like intuitive. So yeah.

527
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:28,300
Yeah. And then like, I don't know if there's a formal name for this fallacy. I've just been

528
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,140
taking I've been taking to calling it the spotlight effect. Where you look at like

529
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:37,180
libs of tik tok, for example, right? Yeah. And libs of tik tok might show you a video.

530
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:43,980
And that video is going to be of a person who is trans or genderqueer or something who is actually

531
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,580
acting quite poorly. And they should maybe they shouldn't have their job in the school where

532
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:53,020
they're talking about doing these weird things. But then you scroll through libs of tik tok and

533
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:57,500
you see another one of those videos. And you might see five of those videos. And so now and

534
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,500
let's just assume just for the sake of the argument that these are five cases of people

535
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:06,460
who probably should be fired for what they're doing. Then you're gonna think this is walking

536
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:13,020
everywhere. This is every teacher now in 2018. Congress asked FBI if they are trapped in the

537
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:21,020
violence. And the FBI said no, then FBI claims what are the most dangerous democracy like

538
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:27,740
a huge systemic problem with every single school in the United States. Yeah. So I don't know. I

539
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,700
just call it the spotlight effects that kind of intuitive that makes sense. I don't know what we

540
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,980
should call that sampling bias. Something availability confirmation bias, motivated thinking,

541
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:42,620
kind of all these. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And then I've also seen like, an equivalent account called

542
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:48,620
chuds of tik tok from the left. And the and they're like, they're posting tik toks of these

543
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:53,180
rednecks, we're talking about how they want to overthrow the government and how democracy isn't

544
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,820
legitimate anymore. And it's like, well, look at these people. It's like, yeah, but these are still

545
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,980
just five rednecks, you know, it's what it's, yeah, it's why we need to like, we need to figure

546
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:05,340
out as a society how to think well. And we tried critical thinking. And that has been fucking

547
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:11,900
garbage. Critical thinking, like, education doesn't work at all. It's basically just like,

548
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:22,220
it feels nice. Yeah, we just need a society that thinks well, like an amazing, amazing researcher

549
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:27,020
who like talks about this type of shit, who's talked to like, people that probably we wouldn't

550
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:31,180
usually respect, like Jonathan Haidt and like other researchers is Julia Galef. Like she talks

551
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:37,420
her entire works, life's work is literally talking about how to think well, because like, these are

552
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:42,300
heavily complicated, highly politicized. So it's like, even if I say, let's get the data.

553
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,140
Okay, well, what if the institutions aren't working very well? Well, they're slow as well.

554
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,940
What if there's a bias within the institution, for example, like sometimes the FBI does tend

555
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,220
to overflow certain things and call like things like terrorism, when it's like, maybe it's

556
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:59,020
terrorism, maybe it's not. But also, like, we have academic institutions who are maybe like dismissive

557
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:04,380
sometimes of like conservative talking points. And so it's like, trust, like we want to use the data,

558
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,940
but interpretation of data can be corrupted by like human political bias. This is like why

559
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,060
when you try to look at like trans athletes, when you try to look at the literature and

560
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:17,820
trans athletes, it is like so complicated to actually work through, which is why I love

561
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,900
talking with Jangles, right? Because he's somebody who's really dominant on the left side of

562
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,260
understanding this. And it was a really, I don't know if you ever saw our conversation. It was like

563
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:29,740
one of the best conversations that I think I've ever had in this space. It was a debate.

564
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,100
I actually don't watch any Jangles. And I don't think he likes me very much.

565
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,660
Oh, that's too bad. He's...

566
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,540
I don't know why. Maybe I trolled him on Twitter once and he, like, I don't, it was,

567
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,580
I don't know. But...

568
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:47,740
That's fair. But he was, he was insanely good faith, right? And we basically came to the

569
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:55,740
space of being like, look, the literature on trans athletes is pathetic. There's not a lot.

570
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:59,900
We don't really know fully what's going on. There's a lot of theoretical speculation.

571
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:05,180
And there's some data that is starting to fall in a certain direction. The problem is that on

572
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:10,540
both sides of the spectrum, most of the data is being interpreted by heavily biased researchers.

573
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:15,100
It's incredibly difficult to find a researcher who's just going into this and in a much more

574
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:22,140
open way, just trying to explore and see what the data actually says. There's one now, there's one

575
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:25,900
lead. I can't remember her name. That's she's doing some really, really interesting. She's

576
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:29,980
coming out with a meta analysis in 2024. And I'm really excited for, but it's like,

577
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:35,820
even in preparing for my trans athlete debates, I went through basically every single study released

578
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:40,540
on trans athletes that I could possibly find. And I've never seen anybody cite a study outside of

579
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:46,140
the list that I look through. And it was like, alarming how little we know, like nobody even

580
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:50,780
controlled for body fat percentage. I think there's one study now that's come out very recently that

581
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:54,620
finally controlled for body fat percentage, when this is like the most obvious thing that you

582
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:59,260
should be controlling for. Like my husband thought of that based erudite. It's crazy.

583
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:02,460
And so it's like, when we're talking about these things, both sides want to see like,

584
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:07,180
it's so fucking obvious. And I'm like, you don't know the first thing about data analysis,

585
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:12,700
if you think that this is fucking obvious, especially complex shit, like political crime,

586
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:17,580
terrorism type shit. It's not fucking obvious. And so it's like, you don't want to be a fence

587
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,220
sitter who does like the false equivalency and be like, Yeah, but both sides are being

588
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:24,700
mean to go babies, right? What you want to do is being like, what if both sides have legitimate

589
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:29,340
claim, but they're very different claims that require different responses, and also are one

590
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:33,900
of these sides posing greater threat to the other is one side more inclined towards violence,

591
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,180
things like that, right? Thanks for the service. Sorry. And the raid. Thank you so much for the

592
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:44,460
raid. There was like, yeah, you got like 20 gifted memberships there. It's a big bundle.

593
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:50,860
Congrats. Thanks, guys. I had see I think it was actually today I saw a Reddit post of somebody

594
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:56,300
who's just like, Listen, it's from a left wing point of view. Listen, the data doesn't matter.

595
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:02,300
And self ID is more important for political reasons. So ignore all that shit. And if someone

596
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,980
identifies, you should just let them play in the sport of their choice. And it's like, well,

597
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,900
no, sorry about that. But I'm not gonna agree with that at all. What is your I haven't watched any of

598
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:15,900
your transports debates. I watched like, actually, you know what, I think I watched one with destiny

599
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:20,060
where it was with jangles. In fact, I guess the only jangles video I've seen in like the past year.

600
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:25,020
Yeah, yeah. So what is your take on the whole thing anyway? Well, we mutually came to actually

601
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,780
good conclusion debate was the most productive shit I've ever come because we came up with a

602
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:33,260
number of prescriptions that seems to do the best at balancing certain things because my orientation

603
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:40,540
is sports is vital for people's well being and functioning. There is one group Hold on, I gotta

604
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,700
sorry. Thank you so much, Anthony Rojas. I gotta skip this alert because I am getting so distracted.

605
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:53,580
But thank you so much, Anthony. I really, really appreciate it. So here's what we see in the data

606
00:50:53,580 --> 00:51:00,780
is it's really important to get teens connected to sports. Sports is one of the most supportive

607
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:06,460
community based well being promoting protective factors that we can give teams that tends to be

608
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:10,860
affordable and accessible. Pretty much across the board, there is still a bit of a financial

609
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,940
gatekeep. But depending on the sport, a lot of those gatekeeps can be somewhat overcome, because

610
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:19,420
it'll be like 20 to $30. Whereas like hockey would be something like 600. Right? So you got things

611
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:24,620
like soccer and track, which are going to be really, really important sports to try to get your

612
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:29,900
lower income individuals, right? So I would, my whole goal in the trans athlete conversation is

613
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,380
saying, how do we get trans athletes competing and ensuring that we're maintaining sport fairness,

614
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:39,260
because sport fairness is not like a simple thing. Sport fairness is a very scientifically

615
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:45,260
defined construct that is heavily researched, dominantly because of the Paralympics, actually,

616
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:49,340
this is where a lot of the sports fairness research really butted out of was looking at

617
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:54,700
people with certain amputations. So I think one of the most famous cases that people talk about

618
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:59,180
is there was a guy who had a leg amputated and had one, actually, I think both of his legs were

619
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:04,700
amputated from from, I think, just above the knee. And he had two prosthetic legs that were

620
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,460
somewhat springy. And what they did when they found out when they researched him is that he

621
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:15,980
couldn't engage with basically like, bio legged people like people who were not amputees because

622
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:21,180
he actually had a fair play advantage because his springs gave a certain increase of force

623
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:25,420
per muscle mass because of the density and the flexibility of the metal springs, right?

624
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:31,660
Something that is fucking complex, by the way, like not self evident. It, you know, it's,

625
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:38,860
it's complicated. So yeah, anyone who was a kid in the 90s, who watched who watched or played

626
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:42,460
video games or shows where you had like a character with robot legs can see that coming

627
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,540
from a mile away. I guarantee you because it's the first thing I thought of. I don't even know

628
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:51,180
the story. The first thing I thought of was he's gonna have bionic legs, he's gonna be able to jump

629
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:57,900
like way higher. Yeah. So what we found with trans athletes right now is this,

630
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:05,020
we do know that it seems that certain advantages are maintained, even after so I would recommend

631
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:10,620
basically always making sure that you have had HRT for about a year, ideally, the actual amount

632
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:17,900
should be two years, we see that hemoglobin levels, red blood cells, and just testosterone as well,

633
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:23,980
tend to be mostly regulated and balanced by that time. The recommendation for T levels is still

634
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:29,740
under five milligrams per like deciliter. That's pretty standard, because most women are between

635
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:36,380
like two to four, and it can be really dangerous and difficult. So that's, that's kind of where

636
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:41,340
most people end. What I suggested to jangles is that that isn't sufficient because it seems to be

637
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:46,700
the case that most trans athletes maintain strength benefits. It's not super clear why

638
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:53,900
my, so my theory based on not just me, obviously, based on what I've read, theoretically speculative,

639
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:58,220
is that the reason that they maintain some of this is because, so a lot of people don't know this,

640
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:02,860
a muscle cell is multi-nucleic. So you can have multiple nucleuses within a single cell. So muscle

641
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:07,820
cells are massive, right? You can have a cell, a single cell spanning the entire length of your

642
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:12,860
bicep because there's multiple nucleuses along it. You can also have them be wider than regular

643
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:18,060
cells, because again, you can add nucleuses to maintain the function across greater volume and

644
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:25,180
space. So these little nucleuses, my own nucleic cells, when you build them up, so say I get a

645
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,100
really big pump, right? I get really strong. And then I maybe get like a major back injury. What

646
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,900
we discover is that if I stopped training, say for a year, my muscles deplete, they atrophy,

647
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:39,260
I'm very skinny and small, no muscles, no gains, but go back to the gym. The first little while at

648
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:44,940
the gym, I'm going to see explosive growth up until basically just a little bit below where

649
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:50,940
I was before. The reason why we see that is because of the nuclei. They never go away.

650
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:57,580
So like for really simply, if I have six extra nucleuses in my motor, in my muscle cell,

651
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:05,420
those things never disappear ever, ever, ever. And that means that your cap for actual cross-sectional

652
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:09,900
space in your muscle is higher because you already made those nucleuses. Whereas the

653
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,540
process of adding new nucleuses in just takes a really long time and a lot of really rigorous

654
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:19,500
training. So that's my theory. And I didn't get into this, but I also suspect that they have

655
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:26,140
greater like motor neuronal. So motor neurons in your body need space. And so the bigger

656
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:30,780
cross-sectional space and muscle is the more space there is for motor neuron, like the really small

657
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:37,100
ones to develop and exist within there. And so you can have two people with similar bicep size,

658
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:41,180
and one of them has developed more motor neurons in that space because they've just done a lot

659
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:45,980
more specific type of training who can be way, way stronger. But if you've already had a lot

660
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,780
more cross-sectional space, those motor neurons don't really disappear either. So these are two

661
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:57,500
things that even after HRT, even after all these things, these two things maintain from what we see

662
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:01,900
permanently or permanently for at least an athlete's career. It might be possible that

663
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,820
like, because cells die and renew every like seven years or so. So it's possible that these

664
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:11,420
things will go away after like a certain number of years, but most athletes careers like five to

665
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:15,100
six years max, right? And they're really peaking. Their peak performances are going to be within

666
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:21,820
like three to four years for most explosive sports. So how do we accommodate this? Well,

667
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:26,700
one of the best things we can do is control for the amount of muscle mass that's being

668
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:31,420
available to a person's body. Women have to maintain a higher body fat percentage,

669
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,820
their organs shut down. If they get below a certain percent, men can go significantly lower.

670
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,780
Typically women need to stay above 12 to 13%, again, depending on genetics. Whereas typically

671
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:45,260
men, some men can go as low as four before their organs start showing up. That's really low. Most

672
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:53,420
men can get to five or 6% and maintain. So that means there is a 6% gap of weight on your body

673
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:58,460
that can be fat or muscle. And so if you're doing explosive sports, you want as much of

674
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:04,700
your body weight devoted to muscle and not fat because muscle generates the force. Fat is inertia,

675
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:10,220
right? Except for in swimming where fat is buoyancy as well. So what I suggested is

676
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:17,100
essentially having like a minimum body fat requirement for specifically at least trans

677
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:22,060
women. And my goal is to also let trans men compete because here's the thing, if trans women

678
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:27,020
maintain an advantage, that means trans men maintain a disadvantage as well, potentially.

679
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:32,300
And so we actually need to accommodate both athletes. So Jangles and I both kind of came

680
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:37,020
to this together, but suggested basically having a body fat minimum, especially for weight category

681
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:41,100
sports. So it's not a solution to team sports, and it's not a solution to all like track sports,

682
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:45,580
but it is a solution to like, actually, most sports in the Olympics are there's a ton of

683
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:50,700
weight categorized sports, like most fighting sports and stuff like that. So that is one

684
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:55,020
solution that I can come up with. But this is based on very paucity of literature. And it's

685
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:59,260
like, and that's just my fucking idea and Jangles idea. Okay. Somebody else who's much smarter than

686
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,140
me and much more trained in the space probably can come up with a better idea.

687
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:09,340
Right. So as somebody who's a layman on this, I'm learning stuff, so I enjoy it. As somebody

688
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:15,740
who's a layman on this, I did my own layman video looking at some data as I understood it as a

689
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:21,820
layman, making sure to tell my audience always that, hey, I'm an English literature guy. I don't

690
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:27,100
have the prerequisite background to really understand this stuff. But here's what things

691
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:35,900
look like to me. And the layman's conclusion that I came to is if you start on HRT when puberty

692
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:40,140
starts, you're probably fine to compete with cis women. Otherwise, you're probably not fine

693
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:45,420
to compete with cis women. If we're talking at like the the the extremely high end of competitive

694
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:51,100
sports, like Olympic level sports, you know. But I mean, if we have no data, we have no data to

695
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:56,860
suggest that one way or the other. That's literally speculative. So possible. It sounds good. I just

696
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:02,460
you know, it sounds good. No idea if that's true. Yeah. Right. However, because you're more educated

697
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:07,100
on this stuff than me. I wanted to talk about the fascism. Maybe we'll come back to the fascism

698
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:11,820
video after this, but I want to throw something at you that I don't understand, but I think you'll

699
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:19,740
understand, OK? Because you have a big brain for psych, it sounds like. I try to. Yeah.

700
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:27,180
So I know a trans person from Scotland named Chloe who's involved in the do it yourself HRT

701
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:31,580
scene. It's not Bob posting different Chloe, somebody who's completely unknown to your side

702
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:39,740
of the Internet. And I went to them and asked them, hey, how does how does how do puberty

703
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:46,060
blockers work? Because she was under the opinion that puberty blockers without HRT accompanying

704
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:52,060
them is bad. And I was like, well, tell me, tell me about it, Chloe, what's your opinion?

705
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:57,580
And she drew me this diagram and tried to explain it to me, but I did I don't I kind of get it,

706
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:00,620
but I think I need somebody who's smarter than me on this stuff.

707
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:05,180
OK, can I show you the diagrams? Sure. You want me to pull it up in chat?

708
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:10,940
Sure. Well, are you going to show your screen? You know, I'll just post the links to you. Let's

709
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:15,420
see if this works. So here's a diagram. Can you can you chat? See that? Or can you see that?

710
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:21,580
I'm going to pull it up like in two seconds. So she painted this. All right. OK, beautiful.

711
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:28,460
Paint for me. She's very wrong, but that's OK. Yes. She's Scottish. I don't blame her.

712
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:35,020
But she had good ideas and spell incorrectly. OK, let's just be super clear about that.

713
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:39,020
She also I think she also spelled receptor wrong. Isn't it a C? Not an S.

714
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:47,500
It is a C. But yeah. So she said that this was basically the the hormonal cycle of what

715
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:53,020
hormones trigger what glands in a in a normal cis person. OK. Does that sound about does this look

716
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:58,460
right? I am I am actually not very well versed in endocrinology, specifically like hormonal

717
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:08,060
endocrinology. Oh, no. So I'm not really sure. I I'm not really sure. And it is gonadotropin

718
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:16,700
is my understanding. My sex hormone receptor. Yeah, I cannot confirm nor deny somebody more

719
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,660
true. You know, who would be good to answer? This is probably somebody like Corey Campbell.

720
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:23,420
He'd be probably more likely to answer this than me. I have no idea who that is.

721
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:30,380
I don't know. He's a he's a biologist who streams. OK. All right. Well, anyway,

722
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:35,740
maybe we can just kind of look at it then, I guess. But the way she described it to me

723
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:41,740
is you have the pituitary gram, which produces gonadotropin. The gonadotropin tells the sex organ.

724
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:48,060
There's a gonadotropin. OK. All right. Well, it tells the sex organ to make

725
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:56,060
your primary sex hormone. And then the the presence of the primary sex hormone

726
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:02,220
tells the hypothalamus to tell the pituitary gland to stop making the gonadotropin.

727
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:08,940
And so there's like two there's two chemicals at play here where one turns the other one off,

728
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:14,620
basically. And this is how she described it to me. And then for all gonadotropins.

729
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:21,340
I'm not sure. I don't know. She said this was a layman's understanding for a layman like me.

730
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:29,260
Then she sent me this second diagram here, and this was what blockers do.

731
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:34,460
And so the blocker takes the place of the gonadotropin, which means that

732
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:42,540
now your body isn't isn't making any like the pituitary gland thinks that there's gonadotropin

733
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:47,100
around, so it's not making any more. But then your sex organ doesn't see any gonadotropin,

734
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:52,700
so it doesn't make any primary sex hormone. OK, because that makes the GNRH analog. Yeah,

735
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:56,540
it looks like I'm finding a similar type of like it's a simplified.

736
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:02,620
OK. Yeah. You just posted to me something that looks very similar. Yeah. Just not made an MS paint.

737
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:10,780
So she said that this is this is what happens when you go on blockers. And the fact that you

738
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:16,620
have no primary sex hormone when you're only on blockers, that's that causes what all the

739
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:20,620
problems that we hear about people going on. It's like bone density problems and stuff

740
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:26,700
that causes those problems. So her solution, she sent me this third diagram. Here's the

741
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:36,780
third diagram. And so her solution is that. You need to have some kind of sex hormone

742
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:41,180
in your system if you're going to go on blockers, you can't just go on blockers

743
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:45,580
because it's the presence of a sex hormone, whether it's the one associated with your

744
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:52,540
birth sex or the other one that basically allows that prevents the problems from happening,

745
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:58,780
basically. OK, and I was like, well, I don't understand any of this, but you would probably

746
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:05,100
need both of them available, right, because men and women both have. Estrogen and testosterone

747
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,060
and stuff like that, because they're all needed for different developmental things. Yeah,

748
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:13,500
but if if you're not producing any from your sex from your sex organ because of the blockers,

749
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:19,980
and that seems like that would probably be a problem. And so this was her logic. And I mean,

750
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:23,100
she's more educated on this than me, but I also don't completely understand it. So

751
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:28,700
unfortunately, I can't comment. I mean, honestly, like this is this is the reality of where the

752
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:33,580
literature is at. We don't understand endocrinology super, super well. Like, obviously, I'm a layman

753
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:38,300
on it. But my understanding when I talk to people who study in the field of endocrinology is that

754
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:44,060
it's like it's a budding field. It's just like most medical shit. There's a lot we know. There's

755
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:51,740
even more that we don't know. Right. And I'm open to any solution that works empirically, because I

756
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:56,300
want trans athletes to compete. I want trans people to transition. I want them to have provided

757
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:00,460
medical care. That is not a problem for me at all. So I'm open to all this, I would just say,

758
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:05,980
just test it, make sure it does work. Make sure it is tanning out. Because I don't know enough

759
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:10,380
about endocrinology to comment on this one way or the other other than saying, sounds cool,

760
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:14,140
makes sense. I don't know enough to criticize it if it didn't make sense.

761
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:20,860
That's where I am, too. But you should definitely test it. Like if this if this would offset a

762
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:25,660
number of the problems with like puberty blockers in like, youth and stuff and like offset some of

763
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:30,140
the like negative effects like bodily that they have based I mean, that would be good. Let's

764
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:33,580
not have people being harmed by their medical transition as much as possible. That would be

765
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:34,780
something I'm obviously for. So

766
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:41,420
well, um, she does some some DIY HRT out of Scotland. And it's the main reason that she

767
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:47,100
won't give anyone blockers without HRT. She's like, No, you have to take them both. And that's

768
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:52,620
kind of her her policy for the stuff that she does. Oh, this Chloe, the one who used to run

769
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:58,060
the DIY directory? No, no, no, no, no, no different Chloe. That's not it's not sorry.

770
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:03,420
Okay. No, completely different Chloe. I'm not I'm not going down a couple's rabbit hole right now.

771
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:08,300
No. Um, there's there's a it also like I've actually made the joke with her a few times

772
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:12,700
like, you know, your your DIY HRT involved in your name's Chloe. And she's like, Yeah, I know.

773
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:20,940
I know I did. But it's a different person. She does a different organization. But she she won't

774
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:26,460
give she won't give anybody just blockers because she believes that it's actually quite harmful to

775
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:31,420
people to go on just blockers. Right. And I just wanted to show you what she had shown me because

776
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:35,420
I don't fully understand it. But oh, well, it was interesting to think about anyway.

777
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:40,700
That is interesting to think about. I unfortunately have no

778
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,540
intelligent commentary to make on it. So

779
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:51,660
Oh, well. Um, so to roll back, if you don't mind, okay. Rewind a little bit. You said you had

780
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:56,060
watched my three forms of fascism video. And yes, it did actually gotten get me in trouble with

781
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:00,620
with some people who are, let's say, on the dissident, right? They don't call themselves

782
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:05,420
alt right. They call themselves dissident, right? Um, because they thought that I was singling them

783
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:09,980
out with my third form. The problem with that is that I wasn't really giving my own opinion. I was

784
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:13,180
summarizing the books that I had read. Right. What do you think the video?

785
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:19,580
Um, I thought it was I thought it was good. It was interesting. I think you outlined some

786
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:24,060
interesting positions. I watched it quite a while ago. Now I feel like I should have prepped it and

787
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:27,580
watched it so that I could have given you more specific feedback because it's been a while and

788
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:31,900
I didn't take notes on it. And if I don't take notes on something, I, I don't remember it very

789
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:36,540
well. Fair enough. Um, but yeah, it was really interesting. Um, I thought you like handled it

790
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:40,060
really carefully. Oh, I feel bad because this is your like magnum openness. Opus. This is important.

791
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:47,820
Yeah, this is this was a big one. So basically, um, do I have an active Twitter? Uh,

792
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:50,940
I'm currently banned off Twitter. I can't be there. But if you want,

793
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:57,500
you can follow an account called Morbius Devo. It's not a bad account. Um, but okay, so

794
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:09,740
wonder how detailed. Okay, so at a podcast co host for for a few years, we were pretty good friends.

795
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:16,940
Um, however, the TLDR is it basically he, he had stabbed me in the back. And that was kind of the

796
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:22,860
end of that friendship in the end of that podcast. And it was fundamentally over political

797
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:27,660
differences because he had radicalized over the course of lockdowns. He was treated very badly

798
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:34,300
by his government, because he had he had he had a job that brought him a lot of money, and had him

799
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:40,300
traveling a lot. And suddenly he was locked in his house by government for like over a year. He

800
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:48,460
didn't take it very well. So he radicalized. And he was he had like, he had a bunch of very

801
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:55,260
esoteric dissident right literature in his house. He had two trans women who were who were very far

802
01:08:55,260 --> 01:09:00,220
right themselves and more than happy to educate him. And he had a giant pile of cocaine. Okay,

803
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:04,700
he was stuck in this house for a year. And he completely morphed into a person that I just

804
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:09,420
didn't want to associate with anymore. Not even because of the politics. I can I can be friends

805
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:14,620
with almost anyone, regardless of politics, but in terms of his personality, his his behaviors,

806
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:20,460
the way he would treat people, I was like, I don't think I want to be. And then of course, he he had

807
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:26,300
backstabbed me and he had backstabbed Sargon and like our entire friend group. So he was just

808
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:30,700
kicked out of our like, we have like a discovery, hang out, we removed him from actually couldn't

809
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,500
trust him anymore. We didn't want no one wanted to talk to him anymore. It was like, okay,

810
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:40,700
we're kind of set. We're kind of burning this bridge here. Um, but afterward, I kind of

811
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:48,140
thought I don't understand what happened to him enough. So I started reading the books on his

812
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:54,540
reading list. And there were some fascist writers in there. And there were some socialist writers in

813
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:59,820
there. There were some libertarians and anarcho capitalists. Basically, his his reading list was

814
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:05,500
like a hodgepodge of everyone who is not the current establishment. I was like, I want to

815
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:13,020
understand this. So I did I spent like a year reading stuff. And then I compiled all of that

816
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:17,260
down into what's, you know, a 20 minute video and put out the three forms of fascism.

817
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:27,260
And the TLDR of it is that the first form is Mussolini's classical fascism,

818
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:34,940
where he Yes, yes, yes. I'm remembering this now. Remembering. So from that, that comes out of

819
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:41,420
the socialism of George Sorel, who was a French socialist. Yeah. And basically, in like the was

820
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:47,980
1890s, maybe there was a big debate among various socialists and communists. And the debate was,

821
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:54,140
why was Marx wrong about the impending socialist revolution? If you read Marx's political theory,

822
01:10:54,140 --> 01:11:01,260
there's a lot in there about about, there's a predictive, almost prophetic element to his

823
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:09,660
theory. He says, Listen, that that the the movement from feudalism to capitalism was natural

824
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:15,500
and inevitable, as the forces of history converge, and it was going to happen no matter what. And so

825
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:19,820
he said, the same thing will happen with the socialist revolution. Eventually, the capitalist

826
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:25,420
mode of production will be brought to its maximum capacity, inequality will ramp up to it to its

827
01:11:25,420 --> 01:11:31,260
breaking point. And there will just naturally be a revolution, we will have the dictatorship of the

828
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:38,220
proletariat. And then as the society educates itself to be more socialist oriented, the state

829
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:43,340
will fall away on its own. And then you will have your your stateless moneyless classless society.

830
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:47,980
This is a natural to Marx, this was a natural occurrence, it was just going to happen.

831
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:55,820
Without any sort of outside intervention. And Marx predicted that there was going to be a huge war

832
01:11:55,820 --> 01:12:00,540
that was coming up in Europe, that would kickstart the whole thing. That was World War One, and it

833
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:06,380
didn't happen. And so from the 1890s, there's actually a previous war, I think was it was it

834
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:11,100
was the Boer War? They also said it might be, I don't remember exactly that. Basically, there's

835
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:16,860
a period of about 30 years in there, where socialists were writing, hey, why, why was Marx

836
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:21,420
wrong about this predictive element of his theory? Where did Marx go wrong? And there was two schools

837
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:26,780
that came out of that. And the first one was Antonio Gramsci in Italy. And he was a member

838
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:32,780
of the Communist Party of Italy. He was eventually purged by Mussolini, and he died in prison. But he

839
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:37,660
wrote the prison notebooks. And the prison notebooks are just a collection of writings

840
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:43,500
that were smuggled out of the prison that he was in. And he wrote about how the reason Marx was

841
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:51,340
wrong. The reason Marx was wrong was that the values that we all share, the moral values,

842
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:58,540
the religious values, these were actually tools of the bourgeois to make the proletariat become

843
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:04,140
invested in bourgeois culture. So for example, the reason that you shouldn't steal is not because

844
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:11,660
stealing is immoral, but because the priest class of your society is indoctrinating you to not to

845
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:20,380
not steal from the bourgeois class. And so all of morality is simply a tool used by elites to

846
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:27,820
prevent the socialist revolution. And Gramsci's prescription to solve this problem was to

847
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:34,620
infiltrate cultural institutions, to infiltrate religious institutions, to infiltrate academic

848
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:40,140
institutions. And once you've taken up positions of power in these institutions, you start to

849
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:45,180
make them more political. You say, Oh, well, every you know, you see here on the progressive

850
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:50,300
side a lot, everything's political. So we will, we will what we'll do is, there's the liberal idea

851
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:55,260
of a neutral space where we can objectively examine things doesn't exist, the liberals are

852
01:13:55,260 --> 01:14:01,180
wrong. Everything's political, everything has some sort of a political bent. So we have a moral

853
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:05,980
obligation to make sure that it's our political bent, and not anyone else's that is privileged

854
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:11,900
in any institution. And the people who the the Gramsci people ended up becoming like

855
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:15,100
the Frankfurt School people. And that's where you get like a lot of critical theory stuff

856
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:19,420
that you see the critical race theory and stuff that the right is kind of correct about,

857
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:22,300
but they don't know why they're correct about it, because they haven't read Gramsci.

858
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:27,580
That was one school of thought. And so you have Gramsci, which then splits off into

859
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:32,460
modern progressivism. The second school of thought was George Sorel. George Sorel believed

860
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:40,620
that the reason that Marx was wrong, was that democracy itself castrated the revolution.

861
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:46,300
Because if you're engaging in a parliamentary democratic system, you are making concessions,

862
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:51,020
you're making deals with these other non socialist groups that do not want a socialist revolution.

863
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:56,700
And basically, they will co-opt you and they will turn you into just an element of the bourgeois

864
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:04,060
that has no revolutionary potential. So for Sorel, the idea was, reject democracy,

865
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:12,140
reject compromise, and be violent, violence, violence for violence's sake. Because if you

866
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:17,180
if you wait for a moral reason to be violent, like a revolutionary reason, you're just going

867
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:25,420
to be co-opted. You must value violence a priori. That this is okay, so far.

868
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:33,100
Okay, so from George Sorel, that's where you get Mussolini, because Mussolini spent most of his

869
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:38,380
life as a Sorelian socialist. And then he developed fascism, basically, the classical

870
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:46,780
fascism basically, as the Sorelian socialism kind of come to its full potential. And he had

871
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:51,900
his, you know, working in a Hegelian sense, he had this idea that the state was supposed to be

872
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:56,460
this ultimate arbiter of all that is good and moral in society. And so everything should be

873
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:01,340
brought into the state. And then he had the corporate economy, the corporate economy,

874
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:05,420
economy was like a series of councils that controlled from the top down all of society's

875
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:11,260
production for the good of the state. And classical fascism, as a political theory,

876
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:17,900
is pretty close to socialism. And a lot of people on the left don't like to hear that,

877
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:23,020
even though it is the truth. What in that it's like, in what way specifically?

878
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:34,460
Basically, that, at least from their point of view, it was because if you're going to be a

879
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:42,220
socialist who rejects democracy, in the way that George Sorel prescribed, the fascist state was

880
01:16:42,220 --> 01:16:46,940
kind of the natural end result of that. And that's how they viewed, they viewed themselves

881
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:54,860
as the inheritor of the socialist project. So the Mussolini fascists basically like

882
01:16:54,860 --> 01:17:01,820
utilized and weaponized the socialist eradication of democracy, because they realized that in that

883
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:05,900
eradication, the process by which it's done necessarily leads to a fascist state?

884
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:11,900
It's something like that. Yeah. It's also that, um, another another difference was that when,

885
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:18,780
when Marx was talking about revolting against the bourgeois, the bourgeois was like a nationalist

886
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:22,300
oriented force, you had like landowners, and you had people in the government and stuff.

887
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:28,220
But by the time the 1890s came around in the 1910s, capitalism had become more globalized.

888
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:33,660
And if you were fighting the bourgeois at that point, you were fighting almost like a landless

889
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:39,420
internationalist movement that had that viewed nations as a, an impediment to their goals,

890
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:44,460
because they, you know, neolibs want free trade, they want to, they view the borders between

891
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:51,180
nations as things that are hurting their business interests. So it turns out that the the Mussolini

892
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:55,580
fascists, they looked at socialism and said, well, if we're going to implement any sort of

893
01:17:55,580 --> 01:18:01,020
workers revolution against the capitalist system, it has to be a nationalist revolution.

894
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:07,980
It has to be a revolution from the right. Because, because the the interconnectedness

895
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:13,740
that kind of comes along with, with the left's broader ideology has led to the problem of

896
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:19,500
globalist capitalism. Um, and then you have then after that, you have neo fascists, which is which

897
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:25,420
are just Hitler, and Hitler kind of took that, and really, one, he racialized it, because he noticed,

898
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:33,180
at least in Germany, that there was a slightly disproportionate amount of Jews working in banking

899
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:38,220
and stuff. And there's reasons for that, that aren't conspiracy. I'm not a conspiracy theorist

900
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:41,820
here. Like, the reason for that is because in the in the days of the Holy Roman Empire,

901
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:48,060
there was a religious, there was a religious persecution of people who handled money,

902
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:51,340
the Christians couldn't do it, but the Jews could, because they had different religions.

903
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:56,060
And so basically, you had a lot of Christian lords saying, hey, I can't actually do anything

904
01:18:56,060 --> 01:19:00,060
with banking, but can you do it for me? And the Jews said, of course, we'll just take a cut.

905
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:03,820
And then they became like banking families, right? And same thing happened in the Ottoman

906
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:08,700
Empire. So there was there's a completely reasonable reason as to why this is happening,

907
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:16,940
that it isn't, you know, the Jews secretly control everything. All right. But basically,

908
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:23,980
what ends up happening is, Hitler took this conception of capitalism as being a globalist

909
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:29,660
problem, and said, hey, the Jews don't have a nation. Like the Germans have a nation,

910
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:36,060
the Italians have a nation. The Jews don't have land. They are a class of people that floats

911
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:42,940
throughout Europe, without a homeland. And does that not make them at least kind of representative

912
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:50,940
of of the the global capitalism that is currently controlling the German working class? So he

913
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:59,260
racialized this idea, and he kind of pushed it to its extreme. And those were those two movements.

914
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:03,980
Someone in the chat says the dude's running a fanfiction. No, no, no, I'm quoting political

915
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:07,420
theory here. I don't agree with any of this. I want to be clear, like I'm not I don't agree

916
01:20:07,420 --> 01:20:12,220
with it. So this is it sounds insane. We're still saying so we've transferred from Sorel,

917
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:17,900
who basically argued that in the process of a socialist movement, movement overtaking and

918
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:23,340
destroying democracy, it would inevitably become fascism because violence is presumed,

919
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:30,220
essentially, for the takeover. I'm not I'm still not really seeing Sorel's link of socialism.

920
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:35,820
The violence is necessary. And because violence is necessary, he essentially equates violence with

921
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:41,660
a fascistic state. And that's why a socialist overthrow will lead to a fascistic state.

922
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,820
I'm just trying to understand Sorel because that that gap isn't quite making sense. I would

923
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:51,100
understand a socialist overtake would lead to a socialist state authoritarian state.

924
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:57,260
So so the violence is part of it. The other part of it was that the the fascists basically believed

925
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:02,940
that to revolt against the capitalist system, it has to be a nationalist revolt against an

926
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:09,820
international capitalism. So it had to be like a nation coming together as a people and uniting

927
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:14,860
and throwing off because it's national. Okay, so the nationalistic nature of the overthrowing.

928
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:21,420
Yes. So part of the reason that the Italians believe this is because they had just fought

929
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:25,260
a war of reunification, right? They had been a bunch of city states that were decentralized

930
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:29,900
in the end, the Austrian Empire owned some other land. And they said, No, we want we want a United

931
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:32,940
Italy. And so they had like three wars over over trying to unite Italy.

932
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:40,540
Is there any? Is there any socialist revolts that we see that follows what Sorel predicted? Like

933
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:45,980
we're because I think we're political theorists get their like meat tested as if their political

934
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:51,020
theories seem predictive of like multiple, multiple instances of this incurring in later

935
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:57,020
history. Right? I would say the Soviets. I think that's why after the Second World War,

936
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:03,500
after the First World War, Sorel ended up throwing his lot in with the Soviet Union.

937
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:07,580
He was an old man at that point. Was that a democratic? I didn't believe Russia was

938
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:12,620
democratic before I thought it was a form of like, monarchy or something. I thought it was

939
01:22:12,620 --> 01:22:18,460
much more of like, I, I didn't believe it'd be a democratic state. They they tried to do like,

940
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:23,580
uh, a Western European style parliamentary democracy that pretty much instantly fell apart.

941
01:22:24,460 --> 01:22:31,260
Um, but yeah, like there was like, there was the czar, the czar. Thank you. Yeah. So it was a

942
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:36,540
monarchy. So it's, this is where Sorel's thing breaks down is he said that a democratic revolution

943
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:41,180
overtake that socialist in nature would lead to fascism, but then the only evidence, how come

944
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:44,620
you're stating the evidence as, and I know this isn't your position. I'm just trying to, I'm,

945
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:51,260
I'm grilling you as, as the, as the one with more information, why would the evidence of Sorel's

946
01:22:51,260 --> 01:22:56,540
predictive power of his theory be Soviet Union, where it was a monarchy state and the Nash,

947
01:22:56,540 --> 01:23:01,340
was it even a, so was it even a socialist movement specifically? Because, oh, are you,

948
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:06,300
and are you saying Soviet Union is fascistic, not communist and they're not at all.

949
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:12,140
So what's communist? Is anyone communist? Um, well, per Marx, this is why they always

950
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:16,540
say it wasn't real socialism, right? Because per Marx, it wasn't. Marx said that communism was

951
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:22,140
a stateless moneyless classless society and the Soviet Union wasn't any of those.

952
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:31,260
So, but, but basically the, the Soviets had a lot in common with the fascists when you actually

953
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:34,940
look at their political institutions and a lot of their rhetoric, a lot of their propaganda,

954
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:38,860
the way that they kind of organized things in their society, they were a lot more fascistic

955
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:43,420
than anyone likes to. And, and, and, and people on the left, like on the online left, like the

956
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:47,740
modern day left, they will say like, they call them red fascists because they were like fascists

957
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:52,460
with, with, uh, with leftists, uh, leftist. Um, and you agree with this assertion? Like,

958
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:59,340
would you agree that, cause I feel like no one except coping communists say that it was fascistic

959
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:03,980
unless basically we're saying that like communism and fascism are kind of like, this is the issue

960
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:07,740
is fascism is an undefined construct in everything that I can like, look into like,

961
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:12,700
nobody agrees. What is fascism? This is why when you say is the GOP becoming fascistic,

962
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:16,780
there's arguments to make for and against it, depending on whose definition of fascism you're

963
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:21,500
using and what tenants of fascism you're using as well. Right. Like with like masculinity and like

964
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:27,660
stuff like this. And so like, I could see elements of it within the Soviet Union. However, I feel

965
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:33,980
like everyone dominantly would agree because these like, like when we talk about communism,

966
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:37,020
right, the class is going to be like, okay, well, what kind of mark, what kind of comments are you?

967
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:41,660
Are you Marxist? Are you Leninist? Are you Maoist? Or are you Stalinist? Right? Like these things

968
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:46,380
are all lumped together. And so I feel like if we say that they're fascistic and not communistic,

969
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:51,260
then essentially, are you saying like the communists are right. There's never been a true

970
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:56,300
communist state, which maybe is true. Maybe the reality is that communist state just cannot get

971
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:04,620
up and kicking. But that seems to fly in the face of like, communism seems much more defined

972
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:07,500
than fascism. So I can understand why you would label that. But I wouldn't be comfortable saying

973
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:11,420
that it wasn't communist as well, because it has so many obvious structures of communism,

974
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:16,780
like government overtaking private businesses, and redistributing land and wealth and like resources

975
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:21,660
as they see fit and redistributing people as they see fit. There's like minimal privatization and

976
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:25,980
dominantly, like huge bureaucratic government bloat, dictating everything and fucking everything

977
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:30,620
over. To be fair, that is what the classical fascist did too. They did all those things as well.

978
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:36,460
So but I thought I thought one of the there's a lot. I thought there was private businesses that

979
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:40,060
were allowed. It's just like Hitler, for example, would go to a private business and be like, okay,

980
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:43,580
you can stay private, you can still run it, but you have to make this thing. Like that was my

981
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:48,860
understanding of how he was versus like Stalin. With the classical fascist with Mussolini, it was

982
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:53,900
much more like the Soviet Union, it was much more state direct control of things. And also,

983
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:59,340
in Japan, there was a lot of there's a lot of nationalization in Japan. With Hitler was unique,

984
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:06,060
because he had no problem taking control of businesses. But he was all but he would always

985
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:12,140
ultimately give them to party elites to control. So they were owned privately. But they did

986
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:18,620
ultimately still work for the government. It's just that the if you had a position in the Nazi

987
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:23,660
Party, you were allowed to enrich yourself off of these businesses. Can I take it still wasn't

988
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:27,420
any sort of free market by any stretch of the imagination, though? Yeah, sorry. Can I be the

989
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:31,180
worst? Can I take a two minute? I just need to use the washrooms for quickly. Yeah, no problem.

990
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:35,340
No problem. Sorry about going on my own rent. So we're going on my own rent, by the way. I'm not

991
01:26:35,340 --> 01:26:45,980
even done it. But yeah. Um, hello, chat. How's it going? You know what, I probably should have

992
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:52,860
also rewatched my video. You know, if I was going to be talking about the the in depth ideas of my

993
01:26:52,860 --> 01:27:01,740
video, I probably should have also rewatched it. Oops. Here, you know what, maybe I'll if you guys

994
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:12,620
want to see it. I cite all the books that I use in the video. Here. I'll post it in the YouTube

995
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:25,260
chat if you guys like. Here it is. Hopefully that is allowed. Oh, didn't appear. I can't post a link

996
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:34,620
in the YouTube chat here. If I do like, it's called three forms of fascism. By short, fat,

997
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:39,980
otaku. There are no depths your ideas dude, read, watch the video, read the books, man.

998
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:49,820
Dead being unprepared. Okay, here, here. So let me I'll post this in YouTube and in Twitch. Okay.

999
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:59,900
And I would highly recommend you guys check out the reading list in there.

1000
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:05,980
If you don't mind. I'll post in Twitch too. Here it is in Twitch. This is my Twitch account. Hello.

1001
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:11,980
Um, and the books that I cited were George Sorrell's reflections on violence.

1002
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:17,580
Um, the mass psychology of fascism, the open society and its enemies.

1003
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:25,020
Uh, the origins of totalitarianism. Um, what was there was another big one.

1004
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:32,060
I can't recall. Shit. I did. I debuted my camp for the video.

1005
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:41,180
There's one more that I can't remember what it was called. Oh, neither right nor left.

1006
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:48,060
By Zeeb sternhill. That's a very boring book, but it's packed full of information. So chat,

1007
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:52,460
that's all the that's all the books that I used. And please consider checking the video

1008
01:28:52,460 --> 01:29:02,940
because I also haven't rewatched it. So oops. Um, I I am back. What's up?

1009
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:07,980
Apparently, there's like a big thing getting dropped right now with laughs saying that

1010
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:11,420
destiny sleeps with all the females that he streams within grooms them.

1011
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:18,220
Uh, and somebody said that he might've my name might've been dropped. Um, which if that's the

1012
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:23,420
case, there's a big problem because that's not true at all. We were fully platonic. So,

1013
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:29,500
uh, I don't really want somebody. I have a husband actually. Oh, okay. All right. Well,

1014
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:32,140
there you go. Well, I just want to make somebody who's like lying about

1015
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:39,580
my friend being a groomer and then using my name. Um, yeah, that's, yeah, that's going to

1016
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:45,580
be a problem. So I'm just having somebody check. Okay. That's true. Cause if, okay.

1017
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:50,860
I'm just getting somebody to check through the clip and see if, uh, if my name is actually

1018
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:57,020
being dropped or not. I see. Does that mean that we'll have to talk another time and you have to

1019
01:29:57,020 --> 01:30:04,460
go and you have to go to war against this person? We'll see. Okay. Well, I'll see if I can finish

1020
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:08,060
up. So yeah, by the way, sorry about my own scatterbrainness because I also haven't watched

1021
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:15,020
the video in like a month. Um, but basically the two prongs of Mussolini's fascism was

1022
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:22,540
one violence for violence sake. And two was, um, was capitalism is an internationalist movement.

1023
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:26,860
And so the, so the revolution has to be a nationalist revolution. And he based that on

1024
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:33,980
this idea that Italy fought very hard to, to unify during its three wars of unification.

1025
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:41,180
The final war of unification was what we call world war one. And after Italy sacrificed half

1026
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:48,460
a million men and went into economic debt, the other, um, the other world war one victors,

1027
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:54,380
most notably the Americans basically denied Italy's promise because they were promised by

1028
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:58,540
France and Britain, certain components of the Austrian empire that had ethnically Italian

1029
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:03,340
people living there. And the Americans said, ah, no, you don't get that actually. And so

1030
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:07,500
the socialists, the Italian socialists at the time, they were writing political theory

1031
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:13,260
about what they called the proletarian nation. And the proletarian nation was this idea that

1032
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:18,220
if we have a proletariat class of people that are being exploited by the bourgeois,

1033
01:31:18,940 --> 01:31:24,220
you also have proletarian nations that are exploited by bourgeois nations.

1034
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:30,220
So you have nations that are, that are highly developed, highly financial. They purchase the

1035
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:34,460
products of other nations. They come into other nations with their foreign money and they,

1036
01:31:34,460 --> 01:31:39,340
and they make these nations dependent on them and their commerce. And then the proletarian nations

1037
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:42,860
have no choice to basically go along with whatever is being given to them.

1038
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:48,700
And this is how the Italian socialists viewed what they called the mutilated victory,

1039
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:57,260
which was when Italy lost a lot and gained nothing in world war one. And it was kind of this view

1040
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:02,140
that shaped Mussolini's view of if we're going to be revolting against capitalism,

1041
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:06,380
it's gotta be a nationalist revolt. And that's where you get classical fascism.

1042
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:11,980
And then Hitler didn't care so much about the whole anti-capitalist thing,

1043
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:16,380
though he did try to frame the anti-capitalist stuff as being anti-Jewish stuff.

1044
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:25,020
And then after those two, you have the modern day fascists. And the modern day fascists are,

1045
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:30,620
they're the libertarian fascists, which sounds like insane if you actually think of it. But

1046
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:36,300
basically their idea is fascist ideology without a fascist state.

1047
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,620
And that's where you have like a lot of, a lot of like modern day,

1048
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:48,300
like dissident right people, they call them Christo-fascists sometimes, Islamo-fascists,

1049
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:51,820
you know, those people that we see floating around the right wing right now,

1050
01:32:52,460 --> 01:32:56,700
that's those people. It's fascist ideology without a fascist state.

1051
01:32:56,700 --> 01:33:04,620
So do you think then that in pockets of the alt-right there is a growing and moving

1052
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:11,420
fascistic state, basically? It is specifically post-fascist,

1053
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:15,180
because they don't care about any of Sorel's work. They don't care about Sorel's conception

1054
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:19,340
of socialism or about Mussolini's conception of the corporative economy. They don't care about

1055
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:29,020
any of that stuff. For them it is fascist tactics. And it's like, what's the word, it's like,

1056
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:42,460
it's something like violence as its own virtue pushed to the extreme, because all forms of

1057
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:46,380
libertarianism, libertarian capitalism, libertarian socialism, and libertarian fascism,

1058
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:51,020
they all view politics as violence itself. So if you go to a ballot box and you cast a vote,

1059
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:55,340
to them that is the same thing as punching someone in the street.

1060
01:33:56,060 --> 01:34:00,700
Because if you're casting a vote for say a law, and that law is now being enforced on somebody

1061
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:05,820
who didn't vote for the law, and then they break the law, the police have to come in,

1062
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:11,900
make them follow the law, punish them if they don't, to the entire libertarian wing

1063
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:18,540
of politics, socialist, fascist, capitalist. They all view politics as inherently violent. They view

1064
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:26,380
voting as violent. They view just because it's all society imposing itself on you.

1065
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:28,380
So I think...

1066
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:34,460
Do they think their bosses are violent? Do they think any form... Do you think parents

1067
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:37,020
are violent towards their children, even if they're not physically abusing them,

1068
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:41,820
they're just like dictating them? If everything's violence, then nothing is violence.

1069
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:47,260
I hate the violence argument of being like, if somebody imposes their will on you, it's violence.

1070
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:52,540
No, it's posing their will on you. We have words for these things. If somebody coerces you,

1071
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:56,300
it's called coercion. We already have a word for that thing. We don't need to call it violence.

1072
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:57,500
We have the word coercion.

1073
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:05,180
You see... What was his name? Was it Proudhon? Proudhon wrote something like property is theft.

1074
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:09,740
The idea of property is theft is that if you've taken property from the common unclaimed

1075
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:14,940
property, you have now exclusivized it. So you build your little house and now nobody else can

1076
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:21,180
access that house. It's no longer common anymore. So property as a concept is always stealing from

1077
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:25,580
everyone else. It's a ridiculous concept, but that's kind of how a lot of people think.

1078
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:29,020
This is a very common libertarian thing specifically.

1079
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:37,260
Proudhon was an anarchist leftist. This does kind of filter out through because, for example,

1080
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:43,500
I've listened to Vash say this. Vash has said at least a few times that employment in a capitalist

1081
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:48,780
system is always exploitative, even if you consent because of the power dynamics involved

1082
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:53,420
and the fact that you need money and your boss has money, your boss controls the workplace.

1083
01:35:53,420 --> 01:36:02,860
It's always some form of violence. I've seen anarcho-capitalists will say that taxation,

1084
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:07,420
the taxation is theft thing, right? Where it's like, well, you never consent to that.

1085
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:09,820
The government always comes in and takes your taxes.

1086
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:16,300
So every flavor of libertarianism has a redefinition of violence and coercion

1087
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:20,060
that I'm personally not comfortable with. And when it comes to libertarian fascists,

1088
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:24,220
they, for them, it is the voting process.

1089
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:29,180
For them, the voting process is the same thing as punching someone in the face.

1090
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:37,420
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, anarchists are crazy to me in a lot of ways. Like,

1091
01:36:37,980 --> 01:36:42,700
yes, this is this is why so like politics in political theory, this is part of why I've

1092
01:36:42,700 --> 01:36:46,940
actually like pulled back a little bit from politics is multifolded. Number one,

1093
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:49,660
there's not a lot of interest in politics right now, which is unfortunate.

1094
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:55,740
Number two, I try to do my best to be like decently. Like I realize I'm a person who

1095
01:36:55,740 --> 01:37:01,500
speaks with a lot of like authority in my voice. Like I make, I make statements, right? And I often

1096
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:08,060
don't caveat maybe as much as I should or always need to. And I realized that political theory

1097
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:14,140
and political science is a field that I'm not an expert in, um, and is highly complex.

1098
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:19,020
And I'm always extremely reticent to

1099
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:29,500
add into a world that's already like adding to add into a court of like, conversation,

1100
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:35,180
that more muddying and more garbage, right? Because if I'm like sharing information,

1101
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:38,940
that's incorrect. That's bad, even if I'm not intending to.

1102
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:43,820
Well, firstly, so if we're gonna back up, then sorry for dragging you back in to the vortex.

1103
01:37:43,900 --> 01:37:48,060
No, you're good. It is interesting. I find it really, especially political theory. I

1104
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:53,020
really love political theory. I just, one thing I like think about a lot when I think about

1105
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:59,740
politics that I think is really important to me is that when people sell worldviews, specifically

1106
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:05,820
like political ideologies that are selling a lie to everyone and will make the world a worse place

1107
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:11,340
for not only the people who don't hold that value and are like maybe antagonistic to it,

1108
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:14,700
but it'll actually make the world worse for even those holding the value.

1109
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:19,180
I think that those ideas need to be like bludgeoned brutally out of the court of common,

1110
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:24,300
like thing, not by deplatforming them, by the way, by like proving why they're fucking stupid

1111
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:29,340
and that we shouldn't listen to them. Right. And I, I feel like this hasn't been done.

1112
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:32,460
I feel like it has been done pretty well with anarchists. The problem is that

1113
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:41,020
there's been this growing anti-institutional movement for a lot of good reasons, actually,

1114
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:45,580
because the institutions are failing and the institutions are failing for a ton of reasons.

1115
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:50,780
Right. Most of which I probably don't understand. One of them is that young people tend not to vote.

1116
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:57,900
There is an unfettered corruption within like money and lobbying and who can like basically

1117
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:02,780
like buy the ear of politicians. Right. There is the nepotism that occurs within government

1118
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:06,540
bureaucracies of like hiring their family members and their friends. First and foremost,

1119
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:10,300
there is like all of these layers of things that seem to be like breaking our institutions,

1120
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:15,980
even in academia. Right. Academia is, I mean, I love science and I love academics,

1121
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:20,780
but there's really big problems with it. For example, like there is kind of an ivory tower

1122
01:39:20,780 --> 01:39:25,180
issue within academia where they really don't touch grass a lot. They don't really understand

1123
01:39:25,180 --> 01:39:29,260
like normal people. Right. When I tell academics, for example, that even in Canada,

1124
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:34,860
the bulk of the population still doesn't have a bachelor's degree. They say, that can't be true.

1125
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:39,980
Everyone I know and my extended family all has bachelor's degrees. And I'm just like,

1126
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:45,500
yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, but that's just because you've never gone to a gas plant

1127
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:50,540
where you drive up. It's a parking lot as wide as the fucking sea. It's just a cement sea

1128
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:56,860
with 80000 white trucks and just blue men and blue overalls are getting out and walking into

1129
01:39:56,860 --> 01:40:01,820
this power plant. That is like that is that is a very common experience of North America

1130
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:06,780
that like academia has no conception of. Right. Absolutely. Absolutely. And like,

1131
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:11,500
space culture has ruined academia as well. Right. Like it has it is Rooney. It is bad

1132
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:15,740
for academics. It is anti-scientific in many ways. And it's a really big problem.

1133
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:19,900
Right. And so like these ants, anti-institutionalists have validity.

1134
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:23,420
And so I worry, though, that the answer the anti-institutionalist is going to lead into

1135
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:28,140
the anarchist. And I think like the anarchist worldview, I don't know how if the like more

1136
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:33,980
anarchist worldviews don't pop off, that we don't fall into like civil war because I completely

1137
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:39,740
agree. Yeah. The problem is that anarchy is a lie. Anarchy is a lie. It's a lie. And it is

1138
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:45,100
worse for everyone. Every single person will be worse off for anarchy. This is self-evident.

1139
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:49,260
But the problem is that I feel like, again, I think it's important to criticize your own in

1140
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:52,780
group, my own in group, the liberals and the moderates are trying to be like, yeah,

1141
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:58,140
but these institutions do work. It's like they do, but they there's massive problems.

1142
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:01,980
There are major areas where they're not working, working very well. And it's like,

1143
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:05,980
the problem is that we have a really big, old, slow moving ship and we haven't been

1144
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:09,580
maintaining it very well. And there's rats in, you know, and there's rats in the attic.

1145
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:14,620
And we need to look at this. Right. They're chewing out the bottom. And the moderate

1146
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:18,860
progressives are hesitant to engage in this because they're afraid that if they give any,

1147
01:41:18,860 --> 01:41:23,180
any credence to anti-institutionalist rhetoric, that they're going to become conspiratorial.

1148
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:27,260
You see it the moment, the moment I say this, I know there's going to be some

1149
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:30,540
schizo poster in my chappy, like, yeah, and the Jews are actually lizards.

1150
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:36,300
And it's all lots of the vaccines. You're just like, stop, like,

1151
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:40,940
fuck, there are criticisms to be levied, but your conclusions are wrong. Like, chill out.

1152
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:50,540
So you have basically described like my life story, like to a T. Exactly. So I was here,

1153
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:54,220
you know, I will toot my own horn a little bit. OK, I'll fluff myself just slightly.

1154
01:41:55,100 --> 01:42:02,220
Um, I was maybe considered one of those gifted children that didn't really take off in adulthood.

1155
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:06,620
It's a pretty common story. I was offered like I was offered the choice to skip three grades

1156
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:10,940
throughout grade school. I always said no, because I like my friends. I liked my friends. I don't

1157
01:42:10,940 --> 01:42:17,420
talk to him anymore. I probably should have taken it. But, you know, I was I was the kid who got

1158
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:23,020
90 percent or higher on everything and never did any studying and never did any homework and just

1159
01:42:23,020 --> 01:42:29,260
floated through school, no problem. And I had a giant, big, fat ego about it, you know.

1160
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:35,420
And then I got to university and didn't know how to actually study and didn't know how to live on

1161
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:39,900
my own and I failed out. It's a pretty common story, I think. Right. So that's why I took

1162
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:43,900
four years to to do a seven year degree. And I get disillusioned too, right? Like,

1163
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:46,540
I understand my people like, I don't really want to go to university. Like,

1164
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:51,020
what a waste of my fucking time, because like, this is why I say not all degrees are the same.

1165
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:56,460
Right. The reality is that, like, I'm working in a master's lab and people are going to think I'm

1166
01:42:56,460 --> 01:43:02,620
cocky for this. But the reality is, like, my undergrad was I don't know how the fuck I looked

1167
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:08,220
into my undergrad. Holy shit. Like most people, my undergrad, it's kind of known now that people

1168
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:12,620
who go to my undergrad program and do an honors program in psychology usually are about a year

1169
01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:17,020
and a half ahead of anyone else. But when they enter a clinical psych Ph.D. master's program,

1170
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:19,740
which is like the highest tier of education you can get in psychology.

1171
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:25,500
And it's it's insane how much I can like echo that, even though I've been out of my undergrad

1172
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:30,380
for a couple of years. Like, it's insane. It's insanely true. Like, not all degrees are the

1173
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:33,420
same. This is why I like when somebody's like, yeah, but I have a bachelor's in biology. I'm

1174
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:38,540
an authority on it. I'm like, well, did you get C's? Because then I don't know. Also,

1175
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:42,300
most people who go to university realize that they don't need their bio degree. They need to get

1176
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:47,500
enough of a grade so that they can get the piece of paper so that they can work in whatever other

1177
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:51,500
field they actually want to work in and make money in. Right. And so it's like most people do pump

1178
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:55,980
and dump. They study and cram like two nights before their exams and then they dump it all

1179
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:59,980
onto a piece of paper and then they walk away and they're like, all right, beer and forget time.

1180
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:03,820
And it's like, you're not learning this material in the way that somebody who, for example,

1181
01:44:03,820 --> 01:44:07,900
studies one hour every single day and really tries to consume and absorb it, which is fine,

1182
01:44:07,900 --> 01:44:11,340
by the way. Like if you just need the piece of paper, I don't expect you to study in any

1183
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:15,100
different way. Like that makes the most sense. To be honest, you maximize your enjoyment of

1184
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:19,580
the university experience and you still get the degree at the end of the day. Like that makes

1185
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:23,420
sense to me. Right. But like so many people cope and try to pretend like these things are all the

1186
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:28,140
same when it's like, the reality is like, I did the nerd shit. I did an hour every single day.

1187
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:31,900
I never pulled a single all-nighter. I never started studying a night before a test ever.

1188
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:35,980
I was always studying three to four weeks beforehand. I was studying at all times,

1189
01:44:35,980 --> 01:44:40,940
September, like first, second day of class. I was already building myself self-tests and testing

1190
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:44,620
myself on the concepts that I learned. I was reading ahead. Like I was a fucking nerd,

1191
01:44:44,620 --> 01:44:49,020
which is losership, by the way. Most people don't need to do this. I just actually want to be a

1192
01:44:49,020 --> 01:44:52,860
scientist in this field. Like I actually, this is what I want to do. I wouldn't recommend most

1193
01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:56,220
people who do a psych degree to do what I want to do. If you just like want to like go into HR or

1194
01:44:56,220 --> 01:45:00,300
shit like that, you don't, you don't need to do what I'm doing, but these things are not the same.

1195
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:03,980
But the problem is that people keep trying to act like they are the same. And then the

1196
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:08,460
anti-introduce lines are like, they're fucking obviously not the same thing, right? There's

1197
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:13,180
obviously garbage degrees. There's obviously stupid morons who don't know anything.

1198
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:17,740
Yeah. I have one of the garbage degrees. Well, see, that also sounds like me too, because

1199
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:23,340
so I was, I was like a young communist, you know, being 19, 20 years old, thinking I knew how the

1200
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:27,340
whole world worked, you know, drum daddy. Well, here's the thing. It was partially I didn't know

1201
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:32,140
how to, didn't know how to study, didn't know how to work, didn't know how to live without my

1202
01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:37,580
parents. But also, I mean, I started to actually get attention from women more than I had in high

1203
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:43,340
school. And that, that also changed how I was viewing, viewing school. So I dropped out after

1204
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:49,020
a couple years, went to go work blue collar. First time I'd ever done that. I always floated by just

1205
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:55,180
on my natural talents and it finally failed. So I worked a blue collar night shift job for a while.

1206
01:45:55,180 --> 01:46:00,620
Actually, no, no, no, no, hold on. Sorry. Sorry. I worked for municipalities. So public sector,

1207
01:46:01,500 --> 01:46:06,940
plowing snow, picking up garbage, cutting grass, whenever you see, whenever you see someone in a

1208
01:46:06,940 --> 01:46:11,980
park doing a work, like with a vest and a helmet on, and you kind of ignore his existence. That

1209
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:17,260
was me. I did that for two years. And the one thing that made me not a socialist anymore was

1210
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:22,060
working with the working class. Like my God, that changed my entire outlook on life was doing that

1211
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:25,980
job. And then I was like, okay, you know, I think I should go back to school. So there were some

1212
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:29,580
other like personal problems in there. They don't really matter too much for the story. I went back

1213
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:34,220
to school though. And I found out when I went back to school, I was like, Oh, I can, I know how to

1214
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:38,940
work now. And getting the degree was actually really easy. And in fact, I worked night. That's

1215
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:42,540
when I worked night shift and did the degree during the day. And that kind of sucked. But I

1216
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:49,900
mean, I came out with no debt. So man, yeah, taking time off between like, the number one

1217
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:56,060
thing I could recommend any high school student is unless you know, for fucking sure, take a year,

1218
01:46:56,060 --> 01:47:03,580
just take a year. Because you don't like, ideally, you shouldn't have to treat university like you do

1219
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:07,420
public education, public education, you just gotta fucking get through it. I don't remember.

1220
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:13,100
I remember getting into like one of my mathematics 100 class in university and looking at shit and

1221
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:17,500
being like, I don't feel like I've ever learned this. I remember getting into my English classes

1222
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:22,140
and being like, I don't know what grammar is. Like, I've never heard of these things, right?

1223
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:27,820
Like, I feel like I really did most of my like, learning in university, which like, you know,

1224
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:31,020
proves that the failing of our public education system, but also like your approach to it is

1225
01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:33,980
different. Like you just realize you do want to pump and dump. You're like, I fucking hate this

1226
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:38,780
shit. I don't want to do it. I just want to get through this forced schooling. And it's like,

1227
01:47:38,780 --> 01:47:42,940
God, don't do that with university if you can avoid it. Like, this is why I'm like really big

1228
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:46,300
on technical schools. Like I would always say before somebody should go to university, you

1229
01:47:46,300 --> 01:47:49,900
should go to a technical school. Like unless you know precisely what you want to do, and it requires

1230
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:55,020
a university pathway, do technical, get a trade, even if you're not sure what you want to do,

1231
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:59,260
getting some sort of certificate so that you have a fallback plan B like trade that you can always

1232
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:04,860
do is such a base move. Like if you're really uncertain, just like do a year getting like

1233
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:11,660
a trade in hairdressing, cosmetology, like those are trades. There's lots of like youth work

1234
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:15,900
certificates that you can get. So you can do like respite care and government like government kind

1235
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:21,100
of contracted stuff that pays really well. It's got good contracting, but it's like six, like six

1236
01:48:21,100 --> 01:48:27,420
months to like a year max of training. Yeah, I'm just like really big about pushing trades more.

1237
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:32,060
And I think this is where I think Europe is really out-competing North America in our education

1238
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:36,220
academic system specifically is right as they've like shortened all of their bachelor's to like

1239
01:48:36,220 --> 01:48:40,220
three years on average. And they really try to streamline it of recognizing like,

1240
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:45,820
we're trying to prepare you for a occupation, right? So like if you're taking a degree,

1241
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:49,260
you're moving the direction of working within that field. And we're going to tailor

1242
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:54,620
our bachelor's in that direction, like for the most part, which is just like, it makes way more

1243
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:58,860
sense, right? Like that's why like my friends in like the EU will be like, I already got a PhD at

1244
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:06,780
like eight years old. And I'm like, fuck you. Yeah. You know, for me, like I went to university

1245
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:11,740
because I was expected to based on my immense success in high school and in grade school.

1246
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:16,380
And it was one of the worst decisions in my life. I fucking ruined myself. To be fair,

1247
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:22,300
like I came out of it pretty well in the end. Like I was working on a master's and then I realized

1248
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:25,580
I don't really want to do I thought I wanted to be a professor. I was like, I want to be a professor.

1249
01:49:25,580 --> 01:49:28,780
And then the channel took off. So I guess I want to do this. And I do want to do this. So you know,

1250
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:35,820
it all worked out in the end. But like, I have a friend who was also pretty intelligent, but he's

1251
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:40,700
like, you know what, I want to be a plumber. And he got like a plumber's apprenticeship with

1252
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:43,820
somebody else who is a plumber in the city. And he's doing fine for himself. You know,

1253
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:48,780
I think I think the X, even though university is very important, the expectation that everyone

1254
01:49:48,780 --> 01:49:52,860
should go to it probably isn't that good for us. It's not good because it's not what university

1255
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:59,740
was even designed for. Like university should be for fucking loser fucks like me who want to like

1256
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:04,540
study and do research and wrestle with ideas and inquire. And the reality is like, the problem is

1257
01:50:04,540 --> 01:50:09,020
that our society has convinced us that everyone needs to do this and that you're a bad person if

1258
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:13,020
you're not doing it. It's like, that's not fucking true. Like most people have kids, they've worked,

1259
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:17,340
they've got family, they don't have fucking time to be like, I wonder what it means to be a human.

1260
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:22,140
And it's fine. Like if you're interested in that, that's based, but I don't think everyone's

1261
01:50:22,140 --> 01:50:26,460
actually required to do that at all time. And it's like, this is actually like, I just said in my,

1262
01:50:26,460 --> 01:50:31,420
my grad like statement of intent. And I like opened my statement of intent by basically being

1263
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:37,660
like, university used to be a place of like inquiry and scholarship. And unfortunately,

1264
01:50:37,660 --> 01:50:42,540
at least on an undergraduate level, like it no longer is that, which is why in part, I want to

1265
01:50:42,540 --> 01:50:47,260
go to graduate school because in many more ways, graduate school is, especially in thesis-based

1266
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:52,060
programs, that space where the whole goal of you being there isn't to rush through and get the

1267
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:57,260
degree. The goal is to like be mentored by greater minds than yourself to stand on the shoulders of

1268
01:50:57,260 --> 01:51:02,220
giants and like look into space and wonder why. Like that's the point of university. That's what

1269
01:51:02,220 --> 01:51:07,660
makes it fucking cool. But now like university is just like this cringey shit. And it's, it's not

1270
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:12,460
like it's not, it's not all bad. Like the institution itself still works to some extent,

1271
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:17,260
but it's like, if we can't be honest about the failings of it, then how the fuck are we ever

1272
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:21,820
going to correct it? And if we lie about the failings of it, all you do, we've already proven

1273
01:51:21,820 --> 01:51:25,500
this, is you radicalize the extreme who like don't understand it. Like, well, if they're not

1274
01:51:25,500 --> 01:51:29,100
going to be willing to talk about it and they keep lying that the institution's broken, it must mean

1275
01:51:29,100 --> 01:51:34,140
that there's some deep sinister plot and you know, like the, the higher ups, the great bourgeois are

1276
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:37,500
in on it and they're trying to control us and they're lying because they don't want us to know

1277
01:51:37,500 --> 01:51:41,260
but I see it, I see the truth and I see through all the murk and the misery and right and then,

1278
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:45,180
and then build into this like paranoid thing. You have a great Alex Jones voice.

1279
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:51,260
Is that what I'm doing? You kind of slip into it sometimes. Yeah.

1280
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:55,820
You know what you should do? You should get like a tinfoil hat off to the side and just

1281
01:51:55,820 --> 01:52:03,980
put it on whenever you do one of those. But yeah, that, that definitely, are you,

1282
01:52:03,980 --> 01:52:10,300
hold on. I'm going to be tactful. Have you revealed your age? Yeah, I'm 28.

1283
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:17,340
Okay. Was it, you're, you're a bit younger than me. Was it the case when you were in high school

1284
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:20,620
and you were talking to guidance counselors about what to do after you graduate,

1285
01:52:21,180 --> 01:52:24,860
that they were really, were they still really pushing hard for people to become high school

1286
01:52:24,860 --> 01:52:33,420
teachers? Not in my, I don't remember. I, I'm a bitch. I've been a disagreeable child since the

1287
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:37,580
moment I was fucking born. Okay. I've always been like, I do it my own way. Don't fucking talk to

1288
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:41,820
me. Don't, don't tell me what to do. I know. Right. Like that's, uh, that's my propensity.

1289
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:46,380
Yeah. I've worked really hard on it because it's fucking annoying and it's not very,

1290
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:49,980
how it's bad epistemic humility. And I really come to value that. But, uh,

1291
01:52:51,020 --> 01:52:54,460
you know, when I was 18, I didn't have it. And I had decided at that point that I was

1292
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:58,380
going to be a vet and I had known that since grade like nine, that was my plan.

1293
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:02,380
So I sat down the forced guidance counselor thing and I was like, I don't need this.

1294
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:06,060
I've known since grade nine, I'm going to go to the university to get a pre-vet Medicaid,

1295
01:53:06,060 --> 01:53:09,900
pre-vet, uh, education. And then I'm going to go to, and then I listed like the three

1296
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:13,660
major universities and I'm going to specialize in equine at this university, ideally with this

1297
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:18,220
professor, if I can, I don't need your help. I've already got it figured out. Can I leave now? And

1298
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:22,940
she was like, but have you ever thought about going into nursing? And I was like, she wanted

1299
01:53:22,940 --> 01:53:27,100
nurse. I was in a Dutch school. So I was just like nurses and engineers for everyone. And I was like,

1300
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:31,740
my mom's a nurse. I'm not going to be a nurse. Hashtag mommy issues. So yeah.

1301
01:53:33,900 --> 01:53:39,820
Jesus. Well, for me, something like one third of my graduating class in high school ended

1302
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:44,780
up going into some sort of concurrent education program because they pushed high school teachers

1303
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:48,860
that hard. Everyone wanted to be a high school teacher. They were talking about the big high

1304
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:52,940
school teacher shortage coming up. There'll be so many jobs. And now my generation over

1305
01:53:52,940 --> 01:53:56,220
here in Ontario, there's so many high school teachers and no one has any work.

1306
01:53:57,260 --> 01:54:01,900
Like, well, that didn't work out for me. Like I took a drama class in grade 11

1307
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:06,540
and something kind of sparked in me that felt different for everything else I had done in

1308
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:10,540
school. But I was kind of, I was kind of expected by my parents to do something,

1309
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:17,180
something more tangible. So I, uh, I, I suppressed it and I got an English lit degree.

1310
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:22,780
Yes. Well, actually I was originally going for programming, but I changed over to English lit

1311
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:28,460
after one year. Cause I was like, nope, not for me. I just like the stories, man. I just want to

1312
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:34,140
study stories. Yeah. Kind of, kind of, but like in, in, in grade school, I think starting in grade

1313
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:37,500
six, I started learning basic programming just to like, I wanted to make my own video games. I'm,

1314
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:41,180
I'm a big gamer at heart. I want to make my own video games. So I was making computer games in

1315
01:54:41,180 --> 01:54:45,020
grade six and I was like, I can be a programmer. And then I realized, fuck, I don't want to be a

1316
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:49,660
programmer. This sucks. I can, if you ask me a programmer right now, I probably could, but like,

1317
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:55,980
I do it for myself now, you know? Um, but, but drama, the drama class was it sparked something

1318
01:54:55,980 --> 01:55:00,300
and then I suppressed it basically until we started the YouTube channel, me and my friends.

1319
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:05,100
And I was like, Oh, this is what it is. This is what I want to do. Actually. I like making videos,

1320
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:10,140
like talking to people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's, that's what I do. Had a great conversation

1321
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:15,740
with Stardust a couple of days ago. Yeah. Cool. What'd you guys talk about? I authoritarian

1322
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:21,100
pilled her. Oh, really? I convinced her that it's based or what does that mean?

1323
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:28,940
Yes. Yes. I gave her the anti-democracy pill. Okay. Um, here's the thing. I'm not even an

1324
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:32,380
anti like, I'm not an anti-democratic kind of guy. Like I, I'm still ultimately like a liberal,

1325
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:37,020
like pro democracy, pro capitalism, pro, you know, functional institutions. But like,

1326
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:42,380
I know the anti-democratic arguments very well, partially for making the fascism video.

1327
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:45,820
So I know how they think. And I was like, I'm going to, you know, she, she was, she was cool

1328
01:55:45,820 --> 01:55:49,420
with it. Like it was okay. I was like, I'm going to troll Stardust a bit here and I'm going to try

1329
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:55,420
to convince her that, that overthrowing democracy is the way to go. So I gave her all the hardest

1330
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:59,980
arguments that I could, and she was just like, Oh shit. I was like, don't worry. Don't worry. We

1331
01:55:59,980 --> 01:56:03,980
can answer all these. It was, it was just, it was really fun. She's actually great. She's a great

1332
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:09,420
sport. She's very funny. I really enjoyed talking to her. Good. I'm glad you enjoy talking to her.

1333
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:16,700
Yeah. She's a very nice woman. Do you want me, do you want me to authoritarian pill you?

1334
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:22,620
I'm an uppity bitch. I already told you I am way more disagreeable.

1335
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:28,140
Even if I don't have reasons, I'm just like, I already, I just, you probably will. I am dubious

1336
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:33,900
that you can do it. Not even because I necessarily can like out contend with it. I just, I'm just not

1337
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:38,940
as agreeable. It's just, it's just kind of fun. It's something that it's just kind of like a fun

1338
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:45,580
little thing. You can try. I'm curious to see. Oh, sure. Uh, what was that? I know there's what,

1339
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:51,260
um, new taftages, right? I love tough. She's great. I talked to her all the time. She's,

1340
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:59,260
she's got a big brain and big boobah. Well, I wasn't going to say it. No, actually, um,

1341
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:08,300
after her, what I said she has a nice boobah. Okay. Um, after her, um, her first discussion

1342
01:57:08,300 --> 01:57:11,900
with destiny, I messaged her and I was like, you know, you're, you're really cool. Like I really

1343
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:16,540
enjoyed your appearance on destiny. And then she immediately follows me back. Okay. And it's like

1344
01:57:16,540 --> 01:57:21,180
in my DMS, she's like, Oh my God, are you the real SFO? I've been watching your videos for years.

1345
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:26,860
And I was like, um, all right. But she's, she's, she's really nice. She's really smart. Um,

1346
01:57:26,860 --> 01:57:33,260
I love bouncing ideas off of her, but she threw this around in a stream with destiny

1347
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:39,420
and here, let me just, I'll just post it in the DM. Have you seen this before testing

1348
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:42,780
theories of American politics, elites, interest groups, and average citizens.

1349
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:55,340
Okay. So the TLDR of this study is basically, it correlates a voter's preferences to policy

1350
01:57:55,340 --> 01:58:02,780
outcomes such that the lowest income bracket in the United States, who they vote for makes

1351
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:07,660
no difference at whatsoever. So if you're a poor person and you vote for a candidate,

1352
01:58:07,660 --> 01:58:12,940
because he says he will implement policies X, Y, and Z, the chances he will actually implement

1353
01:58:12,940 --> 01:58:19,740
policies X, Y, and Z is basically nothing. There's a zero correlation. However, at the highest income

1354
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:28,780
bracket, the correlation is 0.6. So there's a lot of people who are, who are very anti anti-democratic

1355
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:34,860
oriented who like to lean on this study and say, look, voting doesn't matter. It's all what the

1356
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:40,540
upper-class wants. And that's just how it's going to be. And this is like the entryway into the

1357
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:46,780
anti-democracy component of the internet is usually this study. Does anybody look up any

1358
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:51,340
counter studies that like, uh, challenge this or like any meta analysis that challenges?

1359
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:57,340
Um, well, in, in the destiny TAFTAD discussion, he said that there was some problems with

1360
01:58:57,340 --> 01:59:02,860
reproducing it, but I don't know the full details of reproducing it. If what, what the problems

1361
01:59:02,860 --> 01:59:10,300
were, but, um, there's a, there's a political theory that also comes out of the, it's always

1362
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:14,300
the fucking Italians, you know, it comes out of the, it comes out of the Italians called elite

1363
01:59:14,300 --> 01:59:21,980
theory. And the idea is basically just that democracy is a post hoc justification of what

1364
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:25,820
the elites want and they will make you vote for it using propaganda.

1365
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:30,620
Hmm. Interesting.

1366
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:37,180
And, and when they talk about this sort of thing, they have some real world examples they can cite.

1367
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:41,900
So for example, these people believe that the problem of NIMBYism is a uniquely democratic

1368
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:48,780
problem. And they'll point out the urban sprawl issue in LA as being the best example of what

1369
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:52,540
they're talking about. So I'm sure you've been to LA. I think, I think I've actually seen you

1370
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:56,620
stream that. Haven't you? No, that was Miami. You were doing an IRL with Miami with destiny,

1371
01:59:56,620 --> 02:00:01,420
but anyway, most cities have this problem. They have urban sprawl. So hundreds of miles

1372
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:07,100
of just tiny shitty little houses and tiny shitty little backyards, no apartment blocks.

1373
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:13,820
And everyone's just renting these falling apart, little shit shacks. And, and, and the poor have

1374
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:18,700
nowhere to live. And the land owners don't want the situation to change because that will ruin

1375
02:00:19,340 --> 02:00:24,300
property investment. So the correct thing to do to solve the issue would be to build apartment

1376
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:28,380
blocks. So now there's apartments, they're cheaper. Poor people can go live there. That

1377
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:34,460
reduces demand on housing. So now suddenly you have more people in one place in the apartment

1378
02:00:34,460 --> 02:00:39,420
block. Now suddenly house prices go down. The middle class can have houses again, but every

1379
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:44,700
single landowner will never vote for a zoning change that actually allows you to build apartment

1380
02:00:44,700 --> 02:00:50,940
blocks in these neighborhoods. Because that means that their housing prices, the value of their

1381
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:58,700
investment will just plummet into the ground. And so this is an instance where every single voter

1382
02:00:58,700 --> 02:01:03,900
will always vote for what is best for them and what is worst for society and things don't get

1383
02:01:03,900 --> 02:01:09,900
changed. And they use this model to talk about prisons. Nobody wants a prison in their backyard.

1384
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:13,660
Nobody wants prisoners released into their community. They use it to talk about nuclear

1385
02:01:13,660 --> 02:01:20,540
power. Nobody wants the nuclear reactor in their town because everyone has the shadow of Chernobyl

1386
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:26,780
over their minds. And so basically, if you had, say, a benevolent philosopher king,

1387
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:32,460
he would just build the apartment blocks as society needs them, because he has absolute

1388
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:36,780
authority. He could just build the nuclear reactor. He could just build the prison. He

1389
02:01:36,780 --> 02:01:42,140
could do what is good for everyone and ignore the votes of the people who basically,

1390
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:47,820
they make, like, they're not being unreasonable. They make rational decisions. But it's the

1391
02:01:47,820 --> 02:01:51,180
collective rational decisions of every individual that makes society worse.

1392
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:58,860
And so this is kind of where the anti-democratic Yeah.

1393
02:02:01,820 --> 02:02:08,380
Yeah. How do you feel about gatekept democracy? I'd be curious what you think about that. So

1394
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:12,700
there's some element of gatekeeping, for example, like people can't vote unless they

1395
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:18,220
meet a bare minimum test, which could be as simple as like, can you name three candidates on the

1396
02:02:18,220 --> 02:02:22,060
ballot or like something like that? I guess that would work for you guys, because you guys

1397
02:02:22,060 --> 02:02:27,980
typically only have two on ballots. But I'm a Canadian. Oh, yeah, you're Canadian. Fuck,

1398
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:33,420
I always seem to forget that you're Canadian. Don't I have the accent? Yeah.

1399
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:37,740
Uh, I don't know. I don't really think Canadians have an accent, so.

1400
02:02:38,620 --> 02:02:40,300
All right, really? I mean, I hear it in you sometimes.

1401
02:02:42,220 --> 02:02:47,900
You have like an Albertan accent for sure. Do I? I don't know. I mean, probably. Probably

1402
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:51,820
technically, yes. I just don't hear like a major deviation from Americans other than like a couple

1403
02:02:51,820 --> 02:02:57,900
of our like, ah, like ah sounds usually that are different. I sometimes slip into a Newfoundland

1404
02:02:57,900 --> 02:03:02,540
accent because that's where my family's from. And I spent like some of my youth there. But for the

1405
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:10,700
most part, I'm pure Ontario. So gate kept democracy. There's like a few forms of that.

1406
02:03:10,700 --> 02:03:14,700
So some people, you know, believe that should only be landowners, because if you're a landowner,

1407
02:03:14,700 --> 02:03:21,020
you have like, yeah, that's a bad one. I don't like that. And an investment. It is. I agree,

1408
02:03:21,020 --> 02:03:24,780
it's a bad one. But just to steel man their argument, you have an investment that needs

1409
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:29,580
protecting. So if you own land, somebody else doesn't own land, you probably have more of a

1410
02:03:29,580 --> 02:03:32,860
buy in into the stability of the country because you have more to lose. That's gonna be their

1411
02:03:32,860 --> 02:03:38,700
argument. Some people based on the draft, which is why women, they believe women shouldn't vote

1412
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:42,540
and men should because if you're voting for the country to go to war, you should have to be the

1413
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:47,580
one who dies in that war. And there's maybe something to that argument because death is

1414
02:03:47,580 --> 02:03:57,420
kind of final. I know. Yeah, that's kind of related to like the Starship Troopers argument where

1415
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:03,420
you only get the you can only get the opportunity to vote if you if you either work for the

1416
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:07,340
government for two years or for the military for two years. That's how it was in Starship Troopers.

1417
02:04:09,660 --> 02:04:16,060
Did you hear the news? What's the news? So I don't know what's going on. But destiny just

1418
02:04:16,060 --> 02:04:21,340
started his streams saying that he's going nuclear. So I'm curious if you'd want to

1419
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:26,220
watch some of that with me. There's a clip I'm I don't want to totally pivot. But I feel like

1420
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:29,420
I'd be interested to get your thoughts on a couple of clips that have been sent to me.

1421
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:33,900
Sure, sure. I mean, I guess I could like 30 seconds to do this up. Um,

1422
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:39,020
because I really like this is really interesting. I just know that everyone is going to be

1423
02:04:39,020 --> 02:04:42,220
distracted and wants you to watch this right now. And I'm getting like pummeled with DMS about it

1424
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:46,220
right now. Also, like if you want me to bow out, you know, it's your show. You just let me know,

1425
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:48,940
right? I don't want to I want to actually get your thoughts on it because I think you're actually

1426
02:04:48,940 --> 02:04:54,620
really good. I like how you think a lot. Oh, really? I don't think I wouldn't be able to

1427
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:58,700
categorize at all. Ah, okay. I think you actually do really good critical thinking.

1428
02:04:59,420 --> 02:05:04,460
Oh, well, thanks. I always view myself as exceptionally stupid. Like, I've had some people

1429
02:05:04,460 --> 02:05:08,780
ask, like, despite my academic, like early academic success, I've had some people ask you

1430
02:05:08,780 --> 02:05:14,300
some very tough questions. And I'm like, I don't fucking know. I don't know. But here, I'll TLDR

1431
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:19,740
this 30 seconds. And then we can watch the clips if you don't mind. Regarding regarding gate kept

1432
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:25,900
voting, I think there are strong arguments for many different systems. But I think they all have

1433
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:33,020
the same fatal flaw. And the fatal flaw is, in a social contract society, the point of the

1434
02:05:33,020 --> 02:05:39,660
government is that it is, it wields the monopoly on force. And that is what makes the government

1435
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:44,380
different from a corporation and from an individual, an individual person. It wields

1436
02:05:44,380 --> 02:05:48,620
a monopoly on force, it is the decider of what justice is, it will be the thing that comes and

1437
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:52,460
arrest you if you if you violate a crime, it will be what sticks up for you, if you have been the

1438
02:05:52,460 --> 02:05:59,420
victim of a crime, it has to be the thing that uses force in ways that no other body can. And so

1439
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:04,940
if you are going to be subject to the violence of the government, you should even if you have no

1440
02:06:04,940 --> 02:06:10,860
money, even if you don't pay enough in taxes or own land or, or serve as a soldier, you should

1441
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:18,300
probably have some say in how that force is applied. So if the cops are coming to arrest you,

1442
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:21,980
because you broke a law, you probably should have had some opportunity to vote on whether or not

1443
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:27,100
that should have been a law. I think that is something that all the other systems kind of

1444
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:34,540
disregard. But like, there's, there's something to those systems that can't simply be ignored.

1445
02:06:34,540 --> 02:06:37,900
Because there's lots of people, it seems to be more on the progressive side of things. They say,

1446
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:42,780
like, well, if you want to restrict democracy in any way, that means you're a fascist. And it's

1447
02:06:42,780 --> 02:06:46,940
like, well, not necessarily, right? Like, clearly, democracy should be restricted to citizens of the

1448
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:51,740
nation. And you can't have a bunch of people who aren't citizens voting in your democracy.

1449
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:57,260
Like, there's reasonable things. And I even see the appeal of like, intelligence, like, like,

1450
02:06:57,260 --> 02:07:02,780
are you should like a 65 IQ person be able to vote? You can't even write on the page like,

1451
02:07:02,780 --> 02:07:09,980
I get it. But I think that the the worst evil is the possibility of government violence being

1452
02:07:09,980 --> 02:07:17,180
used against somebody who had no conceivable option to even avoid it. And there's my rent.

1453
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:20,060
What do you think?

1454
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:29,580
What do I think? I think I need to read a lot more political theory before I can offer you good

1455
02:07:29,580 --> 02:07:37,580
interesting conversation, because it's obvious to me that you have way more knowledge in this space.

1456
02:07:37,580 --> 02:07:42,140
And so like you, like, you know, when you're talking to somebody who's like,

1457
02:07:42,140 --> 02:07:45,340
way more trained in a field, and then you ask a question, and then give you that look where you're

1458
02:07:45,340 --> 02:07:51,260
like, fuck, that question makes no sense within the field. That's it. That's it. That's where

1459
02:07:51,260 --> 02:07:57,420
I feel where I'm like, interesting guys, I can I have some thoughts about this. I'll fully admit,

1460
02:07:57,420 --> 02:08:03,900
I'm slightly distracted. Because there's stuff going on privately in my DMS that is like,

1461
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:08,540
very distracting. It was the other way around when it was psychology earlier, because I know

1462
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:12,060
some I know enough to know what you're saying, but not enough to comment on it. Right. So,

1463
02:08:12,620 --> 02:08:21,340
like, I understand completely. Yeah. Um, but, yeah, I guess that's something that we could

1464
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:27,900
always I mean, I, I, I've enjoyed what we've talked about anyway, you know, it's been fun.

1465
02:08:28,620 --> 02:08:32,300
But if you want me to stick around and see what you've got going on, I can do that. Sure.

1466
02:08:33,260 --> 02:08:38,860
I've got maybe I got maybe an hour left of my night. And you can have the hour or we can or

1467
02:08:38,860 --> 02:08:45,900
I can go do something else. It's up to you. Well, I got it. But I do I do. I do kind of want to see

1468
02:08:46,620 --> 02:08:53,820
some of the shit show that's happening right now. Okay. Got a clip. Okay. Can you see my stream?

1469
02:08:54,700 --> 02:09:01,100
I can. You're on Firefox right now. Use Firefox. Yeah. Isn't it Firefox like a memory hog?

1470
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:04,620
It's better than Chrome. I use brave man.

1471
02:09:05,900 --> 02:09:11,420
Using those alt options. Yes, wanting to load me. Oh, it's downloading. That's why

1472
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:14,300
I even have a fair phone, believe it or not.

1473
02:09:17,100 --> 02:09:22,140
Their phone. Is that? Yeah. Do you do programming? Are you one of those nerds who like programs your

1474
02:09:22,140 --> 02:09:27,980
own phones and stuff? Kind of. So a fair phone is a completely open source phone made in Europe.

1475
02:09:27,980 --> 02:09:31,660
So it has like it has stuff that both lefties and righties kind of like about it.

1476
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:38,060
So it's completely made out of recycled material. I think it's like 75% reticle at least. And also,

1477
02:09:38,060 --> 02:09:42,540
there's a lot of right to repair stuff because every component of it can be easily dismantled

1478
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:48,300
and bought on the fair phone website. So lefties like that because of the the openness of the of

1479
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:52,860
the hardware and the recyclability. Righties like it, though, because it also has a bunch of

1480
02:09:53,100 --> 02:09:58,940
like anti tracking and anti data harvesting components to it as well. So it's basically

1481
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:05,980
like that the the best phone if you if you hate big tech and want to be like a Greenpeace advocate.

1482
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:07,900
Okay, so I just I got one of those.

1483
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:13,580
Look at you living out your ethics like a fucking loser.

1484
02:10:14,460 --> 02:10:18,860
It cost me extra $200 to for what I otherwise got, but it was important to me. So I got it.

1485
02:10:19,820 --> 02:10:21,740
Yes. Right. You ready for this?

1486
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:27,100
I am watching. Is that Overwatch? Yeah, Overwatch.

1487
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:30,780
Yes. I like it. So I don't

1488
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:40,940
respect her takes on psychology. Agree. And I feel so.

1489
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:52,780
The way that she and Destiny kind of ganged up on Max was really irritating.

1490
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:57,820
They do this with every fucking orbiter because not so erudite has to signal to

1491
02:10:57,820 --> 02:11:01,900
Destiny that she's still the best one. It's like a golden child syndrome.

1492
02:11:03,340 --> 02:11:07,900
Jesus. And it comes from a deep

1493
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:10,700
insecurity of not knowing when it's going to happen a lot.

1494
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:14,220
Yeah. Oh my god.

1495
02:11:14,220 --> 02:11:18,460
What do you think about that? So from what I understand,

1496
02:11:18,460 --> 02:11:23,420
as somebody in the space for two since 2009, you are deeply familiar with petty drama on

1497
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:28,780
the internet, probably more than I am. So I would love to know your analysis of this clip.

1498
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:32,780
So from what I understand, Destiny is kind of unique on YouTube.

1499
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:36,620
He's kind of unique on YouTube in such a way that

1500
02:11:37,740 --> 02:11:42,540
right now there's the orbiter meta of DGG, right? Where there's a bunch of people coming on,

1501
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:46,300
and they're all kind of jockeying for the attention of Destiny and his viewers,

1502
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:50,300
while Destiny sits there and plays Factorio and gets completely absorbed by League of Legends.

1503
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:57,100
So that's the current DGG meta. And from what I can tell, it's actually kind of unique.

1504
02:11:58,060 --> 02:12:02,540
There are other components of the internet that have like a big central YouTuber and

1505
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:07,820
their smaller friends. So I'm part of the Sargon orbit. You know who Sargon is, right?

1506
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:08,320
Yep. Yep.

1507
02:12:08,940 --> 02:12:13,260
Okay, so there's the Sargon orbit. He's more right-leaning than me, but we've been friends

1508
02:12:13,260 --> 02:12:17,260
for like five years. And we have a lot of spirited debates, actually, in private, because I don't

1509
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:22,540
agree with him on a lot. But we're good friends. And there's like V is in there, and Archwarhammer

1510
02:12:22,540 --> 02:12:27,100
is in there, and I'm in there, and Rags and Mauler, the EFAP guys, they're in there. Adam

1511
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:31,740
and Sitch, you went on their show recently, they're in there. There's like a group of us,

1512
02:12:31,740 --> 02:12:36,700
and we're all kind of like pals, and we all talk about stuff. And we all tend to orbit around

1513
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:45,180
Sargon because Sargon has nearly a million subs. And we do kind of owe partially our success to

1514
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:49,340
him, but it's not as drastic as with Destiny, because Destiny has like made people's careers.

1515
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:55,580
Destiny made Vaush. Destiny has made Mr. Girl. He's kind of made you, in a sense,

1516
02:12:55,580 --> 02:12:59,660
if you don't mind me saying. Oh, for sure. Absolutely. I wouldn't even cope about that.

1517
02:13:00,460 --> 02:13:06,780
Um, and for me, like Sargon definitely made me for sure. He gave me like one third of my sub base with

1518
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:12,780
a shout out at one point. But Sargon didn't really make V. Sargon helped, but V kind of made himself

1519
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:18,460
and Arch definitely made himself and Adam and Sitch kind of made themselves. So we, Destiny is

1520
02:13:18,460 --> 02:13:23,660
unique in that like, the orbiters seem to really depend on them way more than in other YouTube

1521
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:29,820
spaces. And I feel like that that dynamic might actually lead to more orbiter infighting. People

1522
02:13:29,820 --> 02:13:33,260
who are really like, I gotta get on Destiny stream today, I gotta get I gotta get those subs, man,

1523
02:13:33,260 --> 02:13:37,660
I gotta get that money. I gotta get those views. And they kind of see destiny as a path forward.

1524
02:13:37,660 --> 02:13:42,060
And combine that with the fact that Destiny has had a lot of bridge burning over the years.

1525
02:13:42,940 --> 02:13:46,940
Like, there was like the bridge burn with Vaush. And then there was, there was the bridge burn with

1526
02:13:46,940 --> 02:13:51,580
Xander hall, the bridge burn with the surfs, all the lefties, he burned all the lefty bridges.

1527
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:54,700
And then like, I think even with Nick Fuentes, there's been like a bridge burn.

1528
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:59,500
Yeah. I'm not sure if they're not doing anything together in the last one.

1529
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:03,500
Yeah. So and I haven't seen him do anything with Lauren Southern recently, either. But

1530
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:07,740
maybe that's burned me. I don't know. I'm not even I'm not like, I don't know destiny. I've

1531
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:13,340
talked to him in DMS a couple times. And I actually wanted to stream once like late night,

1532
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:18,060
like a year and a half ago. And I had just started watching him. And I got so like,

1533
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:21,580
nervous. I couldn't talk to him. And I made myself sound like a complete fucking retard.

1534
02:14:21,580 --> 02:14:24,780
And I was like, Please don't upload this VOD. And he's like, Don't worry, I won't understand.

1535
02:14:25,900 --> 02:14:28,620
But I haven't had a chance to talk to him again since then. And he's kind of hard to get a hold

1536
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:35,580
of. I'd like to but um, I don't know if I have anything relevant to say on anything. But um,

1537
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:43,020
I do know that a lot of I'm not I'm not in his head. But so from the outside, it seems like

1538
02:14:43,020 --> 02:14:47,980
there's a lot of bridge burning happening. A lot of like, kind of people are using him,

1539
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:52,540
blowing up their platforms, like book smarts and burning the bridge and then

1540
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:58,540
running away with now that they've had a career that's gotten jump started. And when I this just

1541
02:14:58,540 --> 02:15:05,020
seems to be like another case of that, when I see this, and maybe that maybe these people

1542
02:15:05,020 --> 02:15:08,300
shit talking you is going to be a component of that, because you seem like one of the

1543
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:13,900
people who wouldn't do that to destiny. So maybe that's what's going on here. That that

1544
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:18,700
kind of seems like what's happening. Like I don't, I don't know who these two people are

1545
02:15:18,700 --> 02:15:20,060
that are talking but just from the

1546
02:15:20,060 --> 02:15:21,420
It's Anna and

1547
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:22,540
Lav.

1548
02:15:23,900 --> 02:15:25,180
Who who are these two people?

1549
02:15:25,180 --> 02:15:25,740
Ann of War?

1550
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:35,820
Oh, Anna. Okay. Okay. Yes. Oh, God. The person that you cannot speak about in DGG. I know who

1551
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:39,580
that is. It's tricky, right? There's multiple reasons why you shouldn't speak about it. Like

1552
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:45,660
she did get like a aggressive level of like, hatred that like, really distressed her as well.

1553
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:50,620
Not saying that she was perfect in the whole thing. But yeah. Yeah, I know. I know the basic

1554
02:15:50,620 --> 02:15:54,940
story that I know there's some some weirdness. The other person though, I, I think I've seen

1555
02:15:54,940 --> 02:15:58,380
her on a few of destiny streams, but I don't know what her deal is. I haven't. I don't know that.

1556
02:15:58,380 --> 02:16:03,900
I'm sorry. But it does seem like from an outsider's point of view, this is like the orbiter jockeying

1557
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:08,540
meta right now. That I think is just a continuation of what we've seen before.

1558
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:11,580
So I have one more thing to share you. And then I would like to

1559
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:14,060
watch a bit of a live stream with you if that's okay.

1560
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:15,580
Sure thing.

1561
02:16:15,580 --> 02:16:20,700
Okay. Face takes. See, I told you, I knew that you think well,

1562
02:16:21,260 --> 02:16:22,940
okay, share your screen. Sorry.

1563
02:16:22,940 --> 02:16:23,580
Well, thank you very much.

1564
02:16:24,460 --> 02:16:26,220
You're so

1565
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:33,740
I've like, I've seen when I had that kind of big blow up where like, I just failed at a school.

1566
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:38,060
Part of my, I guess the reconstitution of myself, I was trying to be like, well,

1567
02:16:38,060 --> 02:16:41,180
what did I do wrong here? And a lot of it was that I felt like

1568
02:16:42,060 --> 02:16:46,540
I was just I was getting by on, like a natural intelligence that had basically run out,

1569
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:50,220
I hit my wall. And so I need to, I need to try and think differently. And a lot of that was like,

1570
02:16:50,220 --> 02:16:54,940
well, maybe let's be a bit more rational. Let's get a little bit more in touch with like my intuition.

1571
02:16:54,940 --> 02:17:01,900
I've been trying to do some, some almost like you do ski and mental exercises, if that makes sense.

1572
02:17:02,780 --> 02:17:06,540
Okay, you ready? I'm gonna I can't speed it up. No, you're good. You're good. You're good.

1573
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:08,620
I can't see it. I just see your face.

1574
02:17:10,300 --> 02:17:13,020
I'm sharing screen in the discord. You see it?

1575
02:17:13,020 --> 02:17:15,420
Yeah, I can't see the discord. It's just your avatar.

1576
02:17:16,140 --> 02:17:19,500
Oh, that's really weird. Um, let me try.

1577
02:17:19,500 --> 02:17:20,780
It's in your screenshot if you want to see.

1578
02:17:20,780 --> 02:17:22,140
No, I believe. Is that better?

1579
02:17:23,420 --> 02:17:30,620
No. Nope. Here. It's actually a type of glitch that I haven't seen before. So it's kind of

1580
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:31,740
new to me.

1581
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:32,620
Can you see this one?

1582
02:17:35,100 --> 02:17:36,060
Say I'm nuclear?

1583
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:37,980
No, nothing's changing.

1584
02:17:39,020 --> 02:17:42,300
I'm just gonna turn this off.

1585
02:17:42,300 --> 02:17:43,660
Can it be a refresh of it?

1586
02:17:45,980 --> 02:17:53,340
Nope. Still no. Here. What if I leave the call and come back?

1587
02:17:53,340 --> 02:18:01,180
Okay, there we go. It's back. Sorry about that.

1588
02:18:01,820 --> 02:18:07,100
Okay. Can you see it? Is it working? Okay. Can you hear it?

1589
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:09,420
Eyes. How do I hear it?

1590
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:15,580
And I'm not saying that there was any. It's hard. It's hard to grapple with because there's no

1591
02:18:23,980 --> 02:18:30,060
I mean, I reached out to Steven first, right? I reached out to Steven because I

1592
02:18:31,900 --> 02:18:37,740
liked his content. And I assume that like most of the women also did, right?

1593
02:18:38,460 --> 02:18:41,820
So then I have to think about like, did I put myself in a situation like this?

1594
02:18:41,820 --> 02:18:48,780
And the answer is yes. And I can also take myself out of it if I feel uncomfortable.

1595
02:18:50,220 --> 02:18:51,100
And that's what I'm doing.

1596
02:18:52,060 --> 02:18:55,820
Do I think that Steven is an evil person? No.

1597
02:18:57,100 --> 02:19:01,260
At this point, not enough information has come out to make me feel like he's an evil person.

1598
02:19:03,420 --> 02:19:11,020
I wasn't metude. I wasn't, I wasn't harassed. Everything was consensual.

1599
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:14,300
And I'm sure most of the things that he's done with women are consensual, right?

1600
02:19:15,260 --> 02:19:21,580
But now there lies this strange intersection between what is consensual and then

1601
02:19:23,420 --> 02:19:29,100
all these women that are orbiting him that are fighting each other in front of him

1602
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:35,340
for his honor, who have had sex with him or had a sexual relationship with him.

1603
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:39,020
That is kind of GigaChat, I guess.

1604
02:19:40,620 --> 02:19:42,140
And it feels weird.

1605
02:19:42,220 --> 02:19:48,060
I don't know if that's true. I don't know if that's true. Like I, I don't have a sexual

1606
02:19:48,060 --> 02:19:54,220
relationship with him at all. It's super platonic. I'm sure it's true for a lot, but he's in an open

1607
02:19:54,220 --> 02:20:00,540
relationship. He's got a decently, any girl that's attracted to intellectuality is going to be

1608
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:03,580
someone into him. He's pretty charismatic. Yeah.

1609
02:20:03,580 --> 02:20:09,260
It's charismatic. He's good with women and he likes to fuck. So it's like, I'm not surprised

1610
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:12,380
that he fucks a lot of the women that come on the stream, but I don't know if it's true that there's

1611
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:16,940
like this, like it's making it, it's making it seem like there's a necessary requirement that

1612
02:20:16,940 --> 02:20:23,020
a woman is like sexual to be part of the orbit, which is not true. Um, I believe for example,

1613
02:20:23,020 --> 02:20:27,020
isn't like Pixie who's still part of the orbit talks to him like dating and therefore like,

1614
02:20:27,740 --> 02:20:34,780
assumably not involved. Um, I don't know. I do know. I've, I've, I've talked to Pixie a bit in

1615
02:20:34,780 --> 02:20:38,620
DGG. I don't know if she's dating anybody. Um, I do know, I think this is public knowledge,

1616
02:20:38,620 --> 02:20:42,940
so I don't mind saying it. Um, I've talked to Cherry a bunch and apparently they had some

1617
02:20:42,940 --> 02:20:47,260
kind of a fling, but I think that's public knowledge. In fact, I'm almost 90% certain

1618
02:20:47,260 --> 02:20:54,140
that's public knowledge. Um, if they had a fling at one point, um, I know Stardust orbits,

1619
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:59,820
but Stardust isn't as in a relationship. She's got a boyfriend. Um, I think maybe,

1620
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:08,220
Hmm. Don't take this the wrong way. All right. I think maybe the reason people are assuming that

1621
02:21:08,220 --> 02:21:12,780
you have been sexual with him is because you visited him and it's very easy to say

1622
02:21:13,820 --> 02:21:18,460
who's going to go and visit a streamer and not do that sort of thing when the camera's off.

1623
02:21:18,460 --> 02:21:21,500
But my husband was there and his wife is there the whole time.

1624
02:21:22,220 --> 02:21:24,700
Well, sure, sure. But he has an open relationship, right? And I mean,

1625
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:28,220
maybe everyone's assuming that you guys all had a foursome or something. I don't know.

1626
02:21:28,220 --> 02:21:32,140
Like if I were somebody who knew absolutely nothing watching from the outside, just being

1627
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:36,460
a fan of everyone, I could see that being a fan theory that kind of propagated around.

1628
02:21:36,460 --> 02:21:41,660
For sure. I totally understand why that would be a fan theory. And it's like, obviously,

1629
02:21:41,660 --> 02:21:46,220
if I say that I haven't, some people will just take me at my word. Other people are going to

1630
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:49,260
think I'm coping and lying about it. Right. And it's just like, there's, and there's no way,

1631
02:21:49,260 --> 02:21:54,060
like, what the fuck do I do to prove it? Because you're proving a negative, right?

1632
02:21:54,060 --> 02:21:59,020
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. All right. Wondering if there's more of this.

1633
02:21:59,020 --> 02:22:04,700
Because, because how do you consent to something like that? Like, how do I,

1634
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:08,700
how do I consent to having a sexual relationship with someone and then

1635
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:18,220
for them to let me get completely denigrated on a subreddit or in the chat every time I come on and

1636
02:22:18,220 --> 02:22:30,060
then how, how does that, like with Britney or Terry or with all of those, like, how do we,

1637
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:38,220
what is that situation? How do you navigate that situation? It's so strange.

1638
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:45,340
It's weird. It's like.

1639
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:48,300
I have a question about that.

1640
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:50,140
And I would not tell my.

1641
02:22:51,900 --> 02:22:57,980
Is this her confirming for the first time that her and Destiny have had a sexual relationship?

1642
02:22:57,980 --> 02:23:00,700
Or is that, is this also known about this person?

1643
02:23:00,700 --> 02:23:05,180
I'm not going to be asked. I don't know. I don't follow like all of the drama super closely.

1644
02:23:05,980 --> 02:23:06,940
Okay. Okay.

1645
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:09,740
So probably chat will answer that better than I can.

1646
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:11,420
All right. Okay.

1647
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:18,220
Friend to put themselves in that situation or to continue that situation. So I had to

1648
02:23:18,220 --> 02:23:21,580
be a good friend to myself and take myself out of it.

1649
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:33,500
Which I think is fine. Like I said, I don't, I don't think Steven is a bad person.

1650
02:23:33,500 --> 02:23:35,020
Do I think he's impulsive? Sure.

1651
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:42,860
I really, what I'm saying is selfishly, the situation was not good for me.

1652
02:23:46,860 --> 02:23:50,220
It can be good even for other women if they're getting what they want out of it, I suppose.

1653
02:23:50,780 --> 02:23:54,700
To her credit, it probably isn't good for her. If she's, if she feels like she's existing in

1654
02:23:54,700 --> 02:23:59,500
an ecosystem where she's had sex with a guy and she's now surrounded by like his harem

1655
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:02,620
and everyone believes that they're all fucking and they're all fighting

1656
02:24:02,620 --> 02:24:06,060
each other while he just kind of sits there, you know, half paying attention.

1657
02:24:06,060 --> 02:24:09,100
It probably isn't good for her. If that's how she perceives the situation.

1658
02:24:09,820 --> 02:24:12,540
I would agree. She's also like, is getting a massive, massive,

1659
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:15,340
massive amount of hate from DGG. The issue is that it's like,

1660
02:24:21,020 --> 02:24:24,700
I don't, I don't want to say that somebody has like earned it necessarily because I think

1661
02:24:24,700 --> 02:24:28,220
most of the hate that people get online is disproportionate. And I think misogyny

1662
02:24:28,220 --> 02:24:32,940
makes almost all of the hatred against women typically beyond overblown, right? Like,

1663
02:24:32,940 --> 02:24:39,820
um, yeah, there's just, there's just a much smaller margin of error for women to exist within,

1664
02:24:40,460 --> 02:24:45,100
which is a really big problem. Yeah.

1665
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:48,060
The issue is she's also like said a lot of shit where I'm like,

1666
02:24:49,660 --> 02:24:54,300
probably be careful about how you say this publicly. And like, to what, like,

1667
02:24:54,300 --> 02:25:00,380
there's an expectation of like, you need to protect me from like your community being mean to me. But

1668
02:25:02,940 --> 02:25:11,820
she's, um, why she's very young, right? Like she seems she looks kind of young 24. Okay.

1669
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:16,860
I mean, she's not that young, I guess not that young, but I would say she's definitely young

1670
02:25:16,860 --> 02:25:21,100
in like the way that she engages in like the world and stuff like that. For sure. Like,

1671
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:27,420
I can kind of see that from how she talks. Yeah. Yeah. Um, like by 24, that already been passed

1672
02:25:27,420 --> 02:25:31,020
like my own life collapse. I was already kind of growing up at that point. But this this reminds

1673
02:25:31,020 --> 02:25:36,380
me of like, like a female version of me when I was like 20. You know, like, kind of being a

1674
02:25:36,380 --> 02:25:40,860
bit oblivious about some things and wanting other people to take to take responsibility for stuff

1675
02:25:40,860 --> 02:25:47,660
that I probably had at least half of a hand in, if that makes sense. And it's not like the,

1676
02:25:48,540 --> 02:25:51,980
the hyper individualistic view of just take responsibility for everything. It's all your

1677
02:25:51,980 --> 02:25:55,340
fault. Like that doesn't really help either. But there's probably some middle ground between

1678
02:25:56,140 --> 02:25:58,700
it's all my fault. And it's all somebody else's fault, you know,

1679
02:25:58,700 --> 02:26:07,820
the issue is like, you don't, you don't get to say this shit. Like you don't have to play the

1680
02:26:07,820 --> 02:26:13,260
stupid, like politically correct game, but she doesn't get to like, have an out for just acting

1681
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:17,020
young. Like this is the issue, like with sneaker too, like I'll give grace to sneaker, but he's

1682
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:21,980
still culpable. Like people not liking sneaker and like attacking him is also part of it. Like

1683
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:25,580
if you're going to act immature and you're going to say dumb ass shit all the time, the realities

1684
02:26:25,580 --> 02:26:29,580
that there are consequences for those actions. And yes, when you're in public scrutiny,

1685
02:26:29,580 --> 02:26:32,940
those consequences are way bigger than they probably even should be. They're way

1686
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:37,420
disproportionate reactions, which fucking sucks. But that's why the reality is that being in the

1687
02:26:37,420 --> 02:26:43,260
public eye is not for everyone, which is super fucking fair. It's awful. It's awful. And it's

1688
02:26:43,260 --> 02:26:48,220
wrong what a lot of people have to deal with in the public space, but it isn't destiny's fault

1689
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:52,380
that this is existing. And it's just crazy to me that she's saying shit like this when she

1690
02:26:52,380 --> 02:26:57,180
literally just attacked cherry and stardust for like in her mind, me towing Max, when it's like,

1691
02:26:57,740 --> 02:27:01,740
what are the implications of what you're saying here? Like, what are like, think about it. You

1692
02:27:01,740 --> 02:27:05,660
don't get the out of being like, I'm young. I get to walk up. Like, it's like, think about what the

1693
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:09,980
fuck you're saying here. This is really bad. This is really, really bad. What you're implying here.

1694
02:27:10,940 --> 02:27:16,380
Just to clarify what you're talking about was the, um, the midriff exposure drama, right? Yeah.

1695
02:27:17,180 --> 02:27:21,260
Okay. No, I understand what you're talking about. Okay. Um, yeah, that sounds, it sounds like a lot

1696
02:27:21,260 --> 02:27:27,820
of it. Um, the issue is, from what I think, I think the issue is, I think the issue is,

1697
02:27:28,780 --> 02:27:35,260
it's something like, everyone kind of goes through this process as part of their own maturity,

1698
02:27:36,060 --> 02:27:39,980
where they, they like, they say some dumb shit, because they're kind of stupid.

1699
02:27:39,980 --> 02:27:43,420
Do they make like veiled? I don't know if I've ever made veiled accusations at like,

1700
02:27:43,420 --> 02:27:49,820
essentially, like, some sort of like power abuse of a sexual dynamic thing. Okay. Somebody who

1701
02:27:49,820 --> 02:27:54,140
is my friend, especially publicly, right? Like, like, he's been good to her. They,

1702
02:27:54,140 --> 02:27:58,540
I assume that they're friends. They seem friendly. At least, um, he's been exceedingly

1703
02:27:58,540 --> 02:28:02,540
charitable of her, like some of her, like really bad positions. And he's been like, patient with

1704
02:28:02,540 --> 02:28:10,060
her. Like this isn't, this isn't like a normal growing up stuff. It's like, this is worse than

1705
02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:14,620
that because I've never done this. Not even publicly. The worst I ever did even close to

1706
02:28:14,620 --> 02:28:18,940
that was like one time in grade eight, I told my friend that my friend had a crush on her brother.

1707
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:22,700
And she told me that I shouldn't and like asked me not to, which was bad. I broke my promise.

1708
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:27,340
That was bad. But that's like, I'm pretty sure that's the last time I ever like fucking crossed

1709
02:28:27,340 --> 02:28:33,260
that boundary because I was like, Oh my God, this is so bad. Like this is, yeah.

1710
02:28:33,260 --> 02:28:37,420
Oh yeah. That first time when like you tell a lie that goes way out of proportion,

1711
02:28:37,420 --> 02:28:41,020
reality snaps back. You're fucking terrified when it happens. Holy shit.

1712
02:28:41,820 --> 02:28:46,620
Like the idea that destiny giving these people a platform makes them more responsible is actually

1713
02:28:46,620 --> 02:28:54,540
kind of psychotic to me. So, so I was going to get to that. I was, I was trying to be fair to her

1714
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:58,140
before I got to that part of the conversation. I'm sorry. I'm just, I know I'm going, I'm being

1715
02:28:58,140 --> 02:29:01,420
bummed out. I was trying to be, I was trying to dump on your charitable train too, but then I'm

1716
02:29:01,420 --> 02:29:05,260
just like starting to think about the implications and I'm like, what the fuck? Like, what the fuck?

1717
02:29:06,700 --> 02:29:12,700
So, um, let's see if this process were happening to this exact same person,

1718
02:29:13,340 --> 02:29:20,300
but one, it was offline and two, it were with somebody who let's say didn't have an audience

1719
02:29:20,300 --> 02:29:23,500
and it was just somebody she had been sleeping with. And there had been a little bit of

1720
02:29:23,500 --> 02:29:29,660
interpersonal drama in their friend group. It probably would not be nearly this bad. I think,

1721
02:29:30,300 --> 02:29:35,500
I think a lot of it is just exacerbation through the fact that there's like 10,000 people watching

1722
02:29:35,500 --> 02:29:41,340
this drama right now. And that's still ultimately her fault because she did some of this stuff and

1723
02:29:41,420 --> 02:29:46,060
she's allowing her responses to get exacerbated by the fact that she has a spotlight shining on

1724
02:29:46,060 --> 02:29:55,900
her right now. But it's, it's high. It's like 10% understandable, I guess. And 90%, what the fuck

1725
02:29:55,900 --> 02:30:05,740
are you doing? Yeah, because it's still, because even if you can understand, even if you can put

1726
02:30:05,740 --> 02:30:11,820
yourself in her shoes and kind of try to model her brain and it's like, well, what would you do

1727
02:30:11,820 --> 02:30:16,140
if you were her? And it might be something similar. I mean, from the outside, it still

1728
02:30:16,140 --> 02:30:22,460
looks kind of crazy, right? It's still like, you know, if this, this is a streamer who destiny has

1729
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:26,220
collaborated with and has probably grown her stream off of, and it sounds like they've,

1730
02:30:26,220 --> 02:30:30,780
they've had sex. And now that after she's kind of, you know, she's gotten her bag,

1731
02:30:31,420 --> 02:30:35,420
she's here kind of turning on the whole thing, and not only turning on the whole thing,

1732
02:30:35,980 --> 02:30:42,460
but like, not making any sort of actual threat of any sort of like sexual misconduct, but like,

1733
02:30:42,460 --> 02:30:46,460
vague posting about it. Yeah, yeah. She's scraping at the edges of it a little bit.

1734
02:30:47,340 --> 02:30:52,620
And, and it's like, well, maybe I can get like one last, one last bag out of out of DGG before

1735
02:30:52,620 --> 02:30:56,940
I finally burned the bridge completely by by having this new. And it's like that seems kind

1736
02:30:56,940 --> 02:31:02,700
of scummy. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, destiny is now live fighting with Max because I guess

1737
02:31:02,700 --> 02:31:08,540
this is escalated. Would you like to stay and watch this with me? Sure. Of course, again,

1738
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:15,420
in DGG politics is just getting derailed by by DGG drama. Oh, my God, there was that one

1739
02:31:15,420 --> 02:31:19,580
recently he was going to have a guy on to talk about the midterms and it got instantly fucking

1740
02:31:19,580 --> 02:31:25,980
derailed by a bunch of people jumping in and talking about I know I know the black experience

1741
02:31:25,980 --> 02:31:29,420
or something and no offense to that conversation, but I wanted to watch politics.

1742
02:31:29,420 --> 02:31:32,860
Yeah, one thing I will say for love, because a lot of people don't actually know this about her,

1743
02:31:32,860 --> 02:31:39,180
she is actually quite successful in multiple platforms. So she's got about 700k on TikTok,

1744
02:31:39,180 --> 02:31:43,500
I think. And she's written a number of like decently successful Spotify songs as well.

1745
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:48,540
So the dynamic of like relying on him for her platform isn't as true. In fact, I think she's

1746
02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:54,060
helped him go viral on TikTok multiple times. So their relationship actually is a little bit

1747
02:31:54,380 --> 02:31:59,660
at least in platform, helping a little bit actually more equitable than like mine would

1748
02:31:59,660 --> 02:32:04,940
be, for example. Just to make sure that that's known, because there's another there's another

1749
02:32:04,940 --> 02:32:10,060
dynamic in there. You can't make you can't really make money on TikTok. And I don't know what

1750
02:32:10,060 --> 02:32:13,820
Spotify but you can't make money on TikTok the way you can on Twitch and YouTube. So there might be

1751
02:32:13,820 --> 02:32:18,620
an added financial component because it's very hard to move your your audience between platforms.

1752
02:32:18,620 --> 02:32:25,100
You know, if you have a million sub TikTok, you might have like a 70,000 sub YouTube, right? So

1753
02:32:25,820 --> 02:32:32,780
if you have a platform that just isn't monetizable, it doesn't in terms of like how much

1754
02:32:32,780 --> 02:32:36,940
money you're making it matters a whole lot less, you know. So there might still be that financial

1755
02:32:36,940 --> 02:32:43,020
incentive here. Yeah, possibly. I thought on TikTok after you have 100k subs, you can start making

1756
02:32:43,020 --> 02:32:46,940
dollars per view as well. That was my understanding. But maybe I'm wrong.

1757
02:32:46,940 --> 02:32:51,500
And there's, um, there is a pretty big TikToker with several million

1758
02:32:52,700 --> 02:32:57,580
called call me Chris. She's out in Vancouver, actually. And she revealed recently that she

1759
02:32:57,580 --> 02:33:02,940
makes nothing on TikTok. Zero, not a single cent. And it's like, holy shit.

1760
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:07,900
So I'm glad I moved off that site. Holy shit. It's so scummy. That's crazy.

1761
02:33:09,580 --> 02:33:16,060
Okay, well, if you'd like to hear the screaming, I'm having fun. Okay. So your insight says like

1762
02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:19,580
outsider because you're like, you're not really in the orbit, right? So you're like,

1763
02:33:19,580 --> 02:33:23,820
kind of like an outsider viewing from within is really interesting. Can you see this?

1764
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:28,060
I know a lot. I can. Yeah, I know a lot of the people like I know. I know who Destiny is. And

1765
02:33:28,060 --> 02:33:32,620
I know who you are. I know taftaj is, you know, I know who Stardust is, but I'm not in the circle,

1766
02:33:32,620 --> 02:33:41,900
you know, circle. I know. Um, there was shit, there's something I want to say. And I don't

1767
02:33:41,900 --> 02:33:46,220
remember what it is. It's gone. Left my head. She gone. Are you good? If I watch it 1.5,

1768
02:33:46,220 --> 02:33:51,100
I tend to watch. Oh, sure. I can watch it 2.2. If you want. My chat usually loses their shit.

1769
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:56,620
If I watch that too. I have actually a thing downloaded so I can watch it at three. But I

1770
02:33:56,620 --> 02:34:00,060
find if I'm watching it at three times speed, I have to actually watch it and not just have

1771
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:03,660
it on in the background. I can do three, but I have to really be focused on it.

1772
02:34:03,660 --> 02:34:10,300
Yeah. Yeah, me too. I Yeah. And I usually try to passively consume content. Same. Yeah. Yeah.

1773
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:14,060
Okay. Ready? Ready. Should we go from the beginning?

1774
02:34:15,900 --> 02:34:21,100
How? Oh, 30 minutes. Okay. Sure. Sure. There's a 30 minute section where there's nothing happening.

1775
02:34:21,100 --> 02:34:27,340
Okay. Right. Have all my sources, my links, my docs. I usually take time to like get everything

1776
02:34:27,340 --> 02:34:31,020
in a row. Have all my sources, my links, my docs, my manifest. Just tell me if you want to pause it.

1777
02:34:31,820 --> 02:34:36,380
A little bit. For reasons that will become apparent. And I don't think this one is quite

1778
02:34:36,380 --> 02:34:39,820
crank it to max in mind. Can you crank up a little bit as it's coming through to me?

1779
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:43,580
Because it's kind of quiet. Sure. Let me try doing this.

1780
02:34:47,580 --> 02:34:50,300
Is that is that better? It's like the same.

1781
02:34:51,580 --> 02:34:56,060
Nope, it's good now. That's okay. Okay. We're gonna we're gonna wing it.

1782
02:34:57,260 --> 02:35:01,100
A new manifest doesn't work. Come back into a formal write up. I guess

1783
02:35:01,100 --> 02:35:04,700
live and impromptu improv manifesto.

1784
02:35:11,580 --> 02:35:13,980
I like his new emote, the skull emote, the nah.

1785
02:35:16,380 --> 02:35:22,620
Should I should I smoke a little bit? Or should I just fucking go trying to try to think? Actually,

1786
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:27,180
you know what? Before we do this, let me see how this is gonna go. Let's see how this is gonna go.

1787
02:35:27,180 --> 02:35:30,540
Hold on. If I get over 900, I've got to go to the washroom, but I have wireless headphones.

1788
02:35:31,420 --> 02:35:34,540
Are you fucking kidding me? I'm gonna keep listening. Don't worry about it.

1789
02:35:34,540 --> 02:35:35,900
I'll be back in a minute. Okay. Okay.

1790
02:35:44,940 --> 02:35:46,300
Okay, this.

1791
02:35:49,980 --> 02:35:56,700
This situation actually really sucks. Generally, we're gonna go back. Let me take you back a few

1792
02:35:56,700 --> 02:36:01,980
months. Generally, when I meet people online, there is very limited interaction that I have

1793
02:36:01,980 --> 02:36:06,140
at such a level to where I can cut a person off. I wouldn't care. It's incredibly rare. It's like

1794
02:36:06,140 --> 02:36:12,700
three people in my life would affect me. But after a few months ago, after a few months ago,

1795
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:16,620
I had a tumultuous interpersonal thing that happened. And I was like, okay, well,

1796
02:36:16,620 --> 02:36:20,060
here's like a lesson I think that I've learned from myself. I'm gonna reach out and talk to

1797
02:36:20,060 --> 02:36:25,260
more people offline to try to have more like human friendly ish type relationships. Because

1798
02:36:25,260 --> 02:36:30,620
that's what like, um, that's what human beings do. Maybe be good for me. And one of those people

1799
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:37,420
was our good friend Max. And another one of those people before she became a streamer was lab.

1800
02:36:38,620 --> 02:36:40,780
So with her, like a few months ago, she wasn't really into the whole

1801
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:41,980
destiny.

1802
02:36:44,140 --> 02:36:47,900
Oh, yeah. I'll make it smaller. Yeah.

1803
02:36:49,740 --> 02:36:50,860
Oh, yeah. Did that work?

1804
02:36:54,860 --> 02:36:57,500
Well, not really, but they've eased up on destiny at themes.

1805
02:36:57,500 --> 02:37:00,140
Oh, streaming thing. So I didn't really think much of it. It's like, oh,

1806
02:37:00,140 --> 02:37:07,260
random person I've spoken to before, whatever. And, uh, yeah. Yikes. So

1807
02:37:10,780 --> 02:37:16,860
where do we even begin? What happened?

1808
02:37:19,740 --> 02:37:23,500
Am I crazy to think that love has hope? So here's, here's the issue.

1809
02:37:24,540 --> 02:37:28,220
I don't have perfect transparency. Okay. I don't normally make, so here's something that I've

1810
02:37:28,220 --> 02:37:31,740
learned in my life. Okay. One of the reasons why I think I'm quite intelligent and quite good at

1811
02:37:31,740 --> 02:37:34,700
dealing with people generally, because I'm usually pretty humble about the extent of my knowledge on

1812
02:37:34,700 --> 02:37:37,820
a person. So like, I might say, or think that I have a person like 90% figured out, but I'll

1813
02:37:37,820 --> 02:37:40,540
really only act on like 50% because like, truly, you don't know, like, I'm not going to sit here

1814
02:37:40,540 --> 02:37:43,580
like, oh, I mind read you completely. I figured you out 100% blah, blah, blah. Usually I get an

1815
02:37:43,580 --> 02:37:45,980
inkling, I'll ask more questions, interact with somebody more. If somebody would ever ask me,

1816
02:37:45,980 --> 02:37:48,460
and I've said this a lot on stream before, somebody asked me, how well, how do you know

1817
02:37:48,460 --> 02:37:50,940
if you truly know a person? How long do you need? Like, I can do it in 10 minutes. And some people

1818
02:37:50,940 --> 02:37:54,220
do it in hours. Usually I say, well, if I've gone through like a really big situation with somebody

1819
02:37:54,220 --> 02:37:56,220
and they could have fucked me over, then I'll know what that person's like. That's generally

1820
02:37:56,220 --> 02:37:58,700
like my approach. I usually wait to see until big situations happen. And then I kind of get like a

1821
02:37:58,700 --> 02:38:05,020
handle on, on what people truly are like. So that being said, generally when I'm like reading people

1822
02:38:05,020 --> 02:38:08,460
on stream, I'm usually pretty reserved in what I'm saying. I usually don't give like all of my

1823
02:38:10,620 --> 02:38:15,900
just because I don't know 100% and because it's whatever, but I'm going to be a little

1824
02:38:15,900 --> 02:38:20,860
bit more candid with my impressions now. I don't actually think that Lav or Anna or

1825
02:38:20,860 --> 02:38:25,340
Shaylin are that much in the wrong. I think that max is actually like a full-on narcissistic

1826
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:29,340
manipulator. Who's abusive to every single person in his orbit, probably worse than any other person

1827
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:34,060
I've ever seen in my entire life. I kind of got that inkling over the Shaylin videos, but

1828
02:38:34,060 --> 02:38:36,700
truthfully, I'm willing to extend like, well, maybe there's stuff I'm not seeing. Maybe there's

1829
02:38:36,700 --> 02:38:39,020
something I don't understand. Yeah. You know, like maybe there's something going on behind the scenes

1830
02:38:39,020 --> 02:38:44,620
or whatever. Um, so I'm like willing to wait for data to come in, but especially watching him

1831
02:38:44,620 --> 02:38:49,180
interact with Lav on his stream and then seeing how Lav has changed her disposition and then seeing

1832
02:38:49,180 --> 02:38:52,220
the types of messages that Anna sends me now, and then hearing about what Shaylin is saying

1833
02:38:52,220 --> 02:38:56,620
on the logic stream. Now I understand way more like what's. Can I jump in here a bit? Yeah,

1834
02:38:56,620 --> 02:39:02,780
for sure. So two things. Um, one while you've been doing this,

1835
02:39:03,500 --> 02:39:10,620
Chad logic has been doing the Shaylin interview and, uh, I messaged him and I was like,

1836
02:39:11,260 --> 02:39:14,780
I watched the VOD later cause I'm going to do something, but what's been going on in the

1837
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:18,540
Shaylin interview. And he says, apparently some spicy things have happened in the Shaylin interview.

1838
02:39:18,540 --> 02:39:27,500
So, okay. There's a lot of, uh, shit stirring. I suspect we're about to see a massive civil

1839
02:39:27,500 --> 02:39:36,620
war and separation of certain orbiters probably. No, no orbiter will be, will be left. Everyone

1840
02:39:36,620 --> 02:39:42,780
must, everyone must take all we'll be victims of the great civil war. Uh, even, even started us

1841
02:39:42,780 --> 02:39:46,780
assuming about it. Now she switched over from election coverage to destiny, Mr. Girl. Yeah.

1842
02:39:48,300 --> 02:39:51,820
Max has a certain impression. He's able to, the second thing I wanted to point out. No,

1843
02:39:51,820 --> 02:39:54,220
for sure. The second thing is, um,

1844
02:39:57,420 --> 02:40:03,740
there's probably some psych way to describe this that I don't, I don't know, but I think there's

1845
02:40:03,740 --> 02:40:10,220
like, I don't want to word this. I haven't, I haven't vocalized this idea before. It's only

1846
02:40:10,220 --> 02:40:18,060
been in my head. So I'm trying to figure out, um, when you see somebody do something,

1847
02:40:18,700 --> 02:40:26,780
it's actually not important what you're seeing. What's important is what state of mind that

1848
02:40:26,780 --> 02:40:34,140
they're likely to have while they're doing it. Does that make sense? Explain it. It's like,

1849
02:40:35,260 --> 02:40:42,540
um, okay. Let's, let's see. If I told you that I had a girlfriend whose name was Naomi,

1850
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:47,740
was Naomi. There's a few things that I could be doing when I, when I do this,

1851
02:40:47,740 --> 02:40:53,660
I could be saying to you, I have a girlfriend named Naomi. And in reality, I actually have

1852
02:40:53,660 --> 02:40:59,980
a girlfriend named Naomi, or I could be lying to you. I could be saying, I could be saying,

1853
02:40:59,980 --> 02:41:04,780
I want you to think for some ulterior motive reason that I have a girlfriend named Naomi,

1854
02:41:04,780 --> 02:41:11,900
but I don't actually, and it's going to depend how you take what I'm saying to you is going to

1855
02:41:11,900 --> 02:41:18,860
depend on how likely you think either of those, um, mind States that I have is.

1856
02:41:21,340 --> 02:41:28,140
Okay. Okay. So I've, I've seen a bunch of Max's stuff and I actually, um,

1857
02:41:28,140 --> 02:41:34,700
messaged him to interview him. Uh, but he never, he never got back to me. Um, because he reminded

1858
02:41:34,700 --> 02:41:40,300
me of me when I was 19, I see a lot of similarities between him and I, before I went through my

1859
02:41:40,300 --> 02:41:47,100
complete like life ruination. Um, and I was like, this is very interesting because I see a lot of,

1860
02:41:47,100 --> 02:41:52,380
like, you know, I wasn't, there were some bad components of myself that I think I've at least

1861
02:41:52,380 --> 02:41:56,620
kind of tamed as I've gotten older and I see them in him and I'm like, I want to talk to this guy.

1862
02:41:56,620 --> 02:42:02,540
Right. Um, which never happened, but I have been watching his stuff. And when Destiny says,

1863
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:08,380
I think Max is like a, you know, as I call it, a psychotic manipulator of the highest degree,

1864
02:42:08,860 --> 02:42:13,260
you know, as soon as he said that I was, I was in the washroom, but as soon as he said that I was

1865
02:42:13,260 --> 02:42:17,740
like, I had these flashes in my mind of like certain things, nothing concrete that I can

1866
02:42:17,740 --> 02:42:22,140
think of right, right on right now. But I had flashes of like certain things he had said,

1867
02:42:22,140 --> 02:42:28,460
certain feelings that I had towards him where it's like, it could be the case that you're telling the

1868
02:42:28,460 --> 02:42:35,500
truth, but if you were lying about this thing, it's actually highly probable that this is what

1869
02:42:35,500 --> 02:42:40,780
you would say. This is the lie you would tell if you were lying, if that makes sense.

1870
02:42:40,780 --> 02:42:45,340
Well, yeah, it's the issue of like, it's like the kind of like, it's almost in a way like the body

1871
02:42:45,340 --> 02:42:48,940
language analysis where it's like the exact thing that you would express if you wanted to convince

1872
02:42:48,940 --> 02:42:54,220
people that you weren't being deceptive might also look identical to non deceptive behavior.

1873
02:42:55,580 --> 02:43:01,740
Yes, yes. I was trying to, I, I kind of brush at the surface of this when I was talking to

1874
02:43:01,740 --> 02:43:06,300
Stardust, but it wasn't really the conversation. So I didn't get into it. I said, I vocalize

1875
02:43:06,300 --> 02:43:14,620
something like, um, deception versus intuition. Ultimately deception wins because a perfect

1876
02:43:15,180 --> 02:43:20,940
deceptor will look completely identical to the real thing to a perfect intuitionist.

1877
02:43:20,940 --> 02:43:25,180
Well, there's another factor in here, which is the self-deceptor, right? There's somebody who knows

1878
02:43:25,180 --> 02:43:29,580
that they're lying and who will try to like maintain a certain look and the perfect

1879
02:43:29,580 --> 02:43:35,180
intentional deceptor. You can't tell from that, but there are also another category, which is the

1880
02:43:35,180 --> 02:43:39,900
self-deceptors. So they don't realize that they've lied to themselves. So they're living under the

1881
02:43:39,900 --> 02:43:45,900
lie, like the intentional liar, but they believe the lie to be true. And so they're also typically

1882
02:43:45,900 --> 02:43:49,900
going to look just like authenticity because they are authentically reacting to the situation.

1883
02:43:49,900 --> 02:43:53,500
The problem is that they have misconstrued it. This is the most common cause of fights,

1884
02:43:53,500 --> 02:43:58,460
for example, right? You miscommunicate, you misunderstand what a person's trying to say.

1885
02:43:58,460 --> 02:44:02,540
And so you take it in one way when it was intended in a different way. And now you have all sorts of

1886
02:44:02,540 --> 02:44:05,980
feelings and thoughts and emotions when actually all your feelings, thoughts, emotions, and

1887
02:44:05,980 --> 02:44:10,300
criticisms of the other person are based on like essentially like a self-deception because you've

1888
02:44:10,300 --> 02:44:17,100
misunderstood what went on. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess that that's like the other possibility

1889
02:44:17,100 --> 02:44:21,420
where you misunderstand. Right. No, I think I understand what you're saying because what I

1890
02:44:21,420 --> 02:44:26,140
was talking about is if they're actively trying to deceive you. Yeah. Right. When they're actively

1891
02:44:26,220 --> 02:44:32,700
trying to like when I when I listen to Max talk. It's it seems like the stuff he is saying

1892
02:44:33,740 --> 02:44:38,060
is the stuff that you would say if you were lying and actually meant the opposite.

1893
02:44:39,260 --> 02:44:42,220
But it also could still be true, like that's the problem with it, right? It's

1894
02:44:43,820 --> 02:44:45,500
I'm having a hard time putting this in words. I don't.

1895
02:44:47,340 --> 02:44:54,140
It's it's something like. What makes a certain behavior important isn't what the behavior

1896
02:44:54,140 --> 02:44:59,660
looks like. It's what states of mind that make that make that behavior more or less probable.

1897
02:44:59,660 --> 02:45:03,180
It's something like that. I'm sorry. This is the kind of the edge of my understanding right now.

1898
02:45:03,180 --> 02:45:05,980
And so when you're looking at Max, are you basically trying to understand

1899
02:45:05,980 --> 02:45:10,300
like the state of mind to basically make a proper interpretation of the behavior?

1900
02:45:11,820 --> 02:45:20,300
Yeah. So when I see Max, a lot of the things he says are things that you would say if you were

1901
02:45:20,300 --> 02:45:25,340
lying or being deceptive and you wanted to come off as not looking like you're lying or being

1902
02:45:25,340 --> 02:45:31,260
deceptive. Right. And that that seems to be like his bread and butter almost. I see that in like

1903
02:45:31,260 --> 02:45:34,780
every stream he's on every video he's on those at least one moment where I'm like,

1904
02:45:34,780 --> 02:45:40,380
oh, this is one of these, you know? Yeah. And just seems to be like a component,

1905
02:45:40,380 --> 02:45:44,220
like a core, almost a core component of his personality, at least his online personality.

1906
02:45:44,220 --> 02:45:47,900
Anyway, yeah, I've really struggled with Max constantly because I waffle between

1907
02:45:47,900 --> 02:45:52,220
are you self-deceptive or intentionally deceptive? Because you're one of these two things. I don't

1908
02:45:52,220 --> 02:45:57,420
know which it is. And you don't think you ever think he's actually telling the truth or.

1909
02:45:58,700 --> 02:46:02,380
I think if you're telling the truth, but your truth is based on a false perception

1910
02:46:02,380 --> 02:46:05,900
and a small amount of introspection could correct that false perception,

1911
02:46:05,900 --> 02:46:09,420
it's functionally a lie as well. Yeah, fair enough. Yeah.

1912
02:46:11,580 --> 02:46:13,740
I do actually have a girlfriend in Naomi, by the way, just for the record.

1913
02:46:14,620 --> 02:46:16,940
That wasn't that is true. OK, guys, that is true.

1914
02:46:18,700 --> 02:46:20,620
But then again, if I want you to think that's what I would say.

1915
02:46:22,620 --> 02:46:26,860
Yeah, and the issue is that like Max has a continued repeated pattern

1916
02:46:26,860 --> 02:46:31,820
of building a feeling some way about somebody typically upset her angry toward them for

1917
02:46:31,820 --> 02:46:38,140
whatever reason. And he goes resentful and bitter toward them, like I don't think he's just angry.

1918
02:46:38,140 --> 02:46:42,700
I think he's like resentful, maybe even hateful. I can't read that much, but he for sure has

1919
02:46:42,700 --> 02:46:49,180
strong negative emotions toward them. And all of a sudden he can't go. These are just my feelings.

1920
02:46:49,180 --> 02:46:53,100
This person's fucked up. Margin of error. Humans exist within some element margin of error.

1921
02:46:53,820 --> 02:47:00,620
It somehow becomes this person must be evil, malicious and wrong. And then he goes out of

1922
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:05,900
his way to make a moral crusade. So now this isn't actually about his feelings. His feelings were an

1923
02:47:05,900 --> 02:47:10,540
intuition that told him something about the person's character and what he's deduced based

1924
02:47:10,540 --> 02:47:16,220
on his feelings originally is that this person is evil, malicious and wrong. And then he goes on

1925
02:47:16,220 --> 02:47:23,260
a moral crusade that he paints as some greater reaching good, which is what he did with the Dr.

1926
02:47:23,260 --> 02:47:28,620
K. I am concerned about psych ethics and the treatment of this psychiatrist, the people who

1927
02:47:28,620 --> 02:47:33,180
come out on a stream. But it was never about psych ethics because he said from the very beginning

1928
02:47:33,180 --> 02:47:38,860
with me that if the board did not decide in his favor, which it looks like they will not do,

1929
02:47:39,420 --> 02:47:44,300
he would basically take it up and attack the board next because there was no way for him to possibly

1930
02:47:44,300 --> 02:47:49,420
be wrong about his deductions about psych ethics, which means it's not about psych ethics. It's

1931
02:47:49,420 --> 02:47:54,060
about your feelings and you've just made a moral vendetta out of it. And he did this with Britney.

1932
02:47:54,620 --> 02:47:59,740
And it sounds like he's doing it again with destiny. And the problem is in this case,

1933
02:47:59,740 --> 02:48:04,700
destiny is a close friend who actually relied on him and got vulnerable with him, which is like

1934
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:07,260
literally the thing Max has said destiny is worst at.

1935
02:48:08,700 --> 02:48:15,260
I see. Um, well, in terms of the psych ethics thing, like is, is Mr. Girl like involved in

1936
02:48:15,260 --> 02:48:20,220
the psych sphere enough to know, to know what constitutes bad ethics?

1937
02:48:20,220 --> 02:48:24,700
His dad and his grandpa are psychologists. And I've heard mixed reports. Some people have told

1938
02:48:24,700 --> 02:48:29,260
me that he has a degree in psychology, but then when you look up like past articles on him,

1939
02:48:29,260 --> 02:48:33,740
they report him as having a degree in gender studies. So I'm not sure maybe he's got a major

1940
02:48:33,740 --> 02:48:39,020
and minor and I don't know which are which. Well, to be fair, my minors in gender studies,

1941
02:48:39,020 --> 02:48:45,580
so my degree is even more useless. So but, um, okay, let's see here. Um,

1942
02:48:50,380 --> 02:48:53,980
there's something I had again, and I also lost it. I feel like my memory is going in my old age.

1943
02:48:55,180 --> 02:48:59,340
Oh, man. Should we keep going? See if it comes back? Or chats?

1944
02:48:59,420 --> 02:49:00,620
Sure. Go ahead. Go.

1945
02:49:01,260 --> 02:49:04,540
Really abuse or gaslight or manipulate people around him into feeling a certain way.

1946
02:49:04,540 --> 02:49:07,820
And he draws them in, in such an unbelievably effective way that he can get them to feel almost

1947
02:49:07,820 --> 02:49:12,460
whatever he wants them to. And I think that, um, I think that he's done that now with, uh, with,

1948
02:49:12,460 --> 02:49:18,060
uh, with people in his, in people in his immediate orbit. So.

1949
02:49:20,140 --> 02:49:24,140
Oh, I do have a question though, really quick. What I was trying to, where do we go? It didn't

1950
02:49:24,140 --> 02:49:29,740
work. Um, what I was trying to describe to you, did that have like any kind of basis in

1951
02:49:29,740 --> 02:49:34,700
psychology or is that like a, like a fallacy or an effect or something? Or is it just like

1952
02:49:34,700 --> 02:49:39,500
something I've pulled out of my ass? Sorry. The stuff on psychology was, is what?

1953
02:49:40,620 --> 02:49:46,140
Oh, um, when I mentioned the importance of a behavior is not what it looks like, but,

1954
02:49:46,140 --> 02:49:51,020
but what the person's mind state is likely to be is more or less likely to be when,

1955
02:49:51,020 --> 02:49:55,180
is that like a fallacy or is it a, is it like a known psych thing? Is it like,

1956
02:49:55,180 --> 02:49:58,780
because I like, I'm not educated enough to know what these things actually are, or if somebody

1957
02:49:58,780 --> 02:50:01,820
else has described this before. So I'm just wondering if it's like a thing.

1958
02:50:01,820 --> 02:50:06,780
Uh, I mean, you could argue, maybe I've never heard it. Um, it's probably more of a philosophy

1959
02:50:06,780 --> 02:50:11,420
if it's anything, um, kind of like a philosophy of human, which in fairness, like psychology and

1960
02:50:11,420 --> 02:50:16,540
philosophy are like deeply interlinked for obvious reasons. In fact, psychology is born out of

1961
02:50:16,540 --> 02:50:24,140
philosophy. Um, yeah, so no, but it's a really interesting, it's a unique, it's at least gotten

1962
02:50:24,140 --> 02:50:28,220
me thinking so good job. I've never been exposed to it before. Well done.

1963
02:50:29,980 --> 02:50:33,580
Let's, let's keep going though. Yeah. Work on you though. Well,

1964
02:50:33,580 --> 02:50:36,060
because obviously I'm not, I'm not going to be labeled, not like that. Okay.

1965
02:50:36,780 --> 02:50:39,740
Okay. Um,

1966
02:50:43,420 --> 02:50:47,420
let's, I'm trying to think of the order I want to do this in. Let me put together what I think,

1967
02:50:47,420 --> 02:50:50,140
what I think Max's mind looks like. I think, okay. This is what I think.

1968
02:50:51,260 --> 02:50:55,820
I think that Max is extremely narcissistic. And when I say narcissistic, what I mean by that is

1969
02:50:55,820 --> 02:50:59,660
I don't know if Max can ever be wrong about anything. I don't know if he ever sees himself

1970
02:50:59,660 --> 02:51:03,980
as being in the wrong. I think that if something happens and it is wrong because other people

1971
02:51:04,060 --> 02:51:07,340
either don't understand or other people are trying to abuse him or other people are making mistakes

1972
02:51:07,340 --> 02:51:10,140
that just puts them outside of the ability to understand what's going on inside of his head.

1973
02:51:10,780 --> 02:51:13,740
I've noticed this conversationally when he talks to people, he seems unwilling to ever back off

1974
02:51:13,740 --> 02:51:17,820
a read he has on somebody. And I've noticed this when it comes to settling interpersonal drama with

1975
02:51:17,820 --> 02:51:20,540
the stuff with Lex Friedman or that professor that he blew up on a stream or that he blew up

1976
02:51:20,540 --> 02:51:24,540
on Twitter. It seems like he can't ever take any kind of feedback there. And I've noticed it. Um,

1977
02:51:24,540 --> 02:51:27,180
oh, there's one more thing I was gonna say. I think, um, I was gonna say professionally,

1978
02:51:27,980 --> 02:51:31,900
um, happens in a personally happens during conversations. Oh, we're going to get to me

1979
02:51:31,900 --> 02:51:35,900
that where, um, anytime, anytime something negative happens, it's, it's always some other

1980
02:51:35,900 --> 02:51:39,340
person's fault. It's always like another person that's making these mistakes. Um,

1981
02:51:41,660 --> 02:51:47,980
so I think the scary thing is that in Max's mind, uh, hero, his own.

1982
02:51:48,940 --> 02:51:56,140
Okay. In your experience with, with Max, has it ever come off as, um, when he does what

1983
02:51:56,140 --> 02:52:02,780
destiny is describing here, has it ever come off as like a defense mechanism shrouded in jokes?

1984
02:52:03,340 --> 02:52:07,340
Because I know a lot of, a lot of men do that where like, when they're wrong about something,

1985
02:52:07,340 --> 02:52:11,100
they'll be like, ah, fuck you. I'm, I'm actually right. But that, but they know they're wrong and

1986
02:52:11,100 --> 02:52:16,300
they're just kind of like making light of it. What destiny just did just there or what max does.

1987
02:52:16,300 --> 02:52:21,980
Sorry. Uh, what destiny is describing max is doing as like, like when destiny said like max

1988
02:52:21,980 --> 02:52:26,780
never views himself as wrong. He never takes criticism. Um, it's pretty common among like

1989
02:52:26,780 --> 02:52:32,140
male friends when they're criticized their acceptance of the criticism is them saying,

1990
02:52:32,140 --> 02:52:36,460
ha ha, fuck you. I'm right in kind of like a jokey way. Does that sound like what max does?

1991
02:52:37,820 --> 02:52:43,340
I actually don't find that max does the escape through humor that much. Um, I think because in

1992
02:52:43,340 --> 02:52:49,100
part he like really would criticize it. It is a very classic thing men do in general,

1993
02:52:49,100 --> 02:52:53,420
um, that I've noticed it's like a distinctive, like, I think all people do it, but I noticed

1994
02:52:53,420 --> 02:52:56,460
that like the classic band thing, I'll be like, as soon as we're getting into like any level of

1995
02:52:56,460 --> 02:53:02,140
like fee fees, we like avoid through humor, um, which is like adaptive and functional.

1996
02:53:02,140 --> 02:53:04,940
I don't feel like I've noticed max doing it that much though, personally.

1997
02:53:05,900 --> 02:53:07,580
Okay. All right. Yeah. Sorry.

1998
02:53:09,420 --> 02:53:13,340
World and nothing can get in the way of that. Like if he's on a mission, if he's on a crusade,

1999
02:53:13,340 --> 02:53:16,860
he has to like, he's the only one that can task with figuring things out. And if you

2000
02:53:16,860 --> 02:53:18,700
misunderstand, you just have to talk to like his most loyal fans. They'll tell you you're

2001
02:53:18,700 --> 02:53:23,740
not smart enough to understand if you don't otherwise. Right. So damn, I'm trying to think

2002
02:53:23,740 --> 02:53:29,740
of how much I can even say. Um, a few days ago, uh, I started to get a whole bunch of messages

2003
02:53:29,740 --> 02:53:34,940
from people saying that I'm not gonna say who, but it's been a lot, a lot of people that have been

2004
02:53:34,940 --> 02:53:39,180
reaching out to me saying that max has been contacting every single woman I've ever had in

2005
02:53:39,180 --> 02:53:42,940
my discord in the background and a whole bunch of men trying to get lists of women that I've ever

2006
02:53:42,940 --> 02:53:48,300
spoken to. And in his mind, he's built up this idea that I have a, essentially the following

2007
02:53:48,300 --> 02:53:52,780
fetish that I approach a woman. I float the idea of her being on my stream. If she fucks me,

2008
02:53:52,780 --> 02:53:55,820
I fucked the woman. Then I bring her on stream and I have my entire fan base attacker because

2009
02:53:55,820 --> 02:53:59,580
I get off on that. And then I run her out of my community. And I think he's built almost this

2010
02:53:59,580 --> 02:54:03,900
entire narrative off of mining Anna Vienna personally for stories and information. I don't

2011
02:54:03,900 --> 02:54:07,740
know when they started talking, but I think that he's really good at talking to people and building

2012
02:54:07,740 --> 02:54:09,820
them up in the ways that they want to be built up so that he can get the information from them

2013
02:54:09,820 --> 02:54:13,500
that they want to give him. And yeah, him and Anna have been talking a lot in the background.

2014
02:54:13,500 --> 02:54:17,660
He's got this archetype or narrative in his head for how I treat women on my stream. And he's also

2015
02:54:17,660 --> 02:54:20,460
got love who I just love reveal that we hooked up. Now you know how fucking irritating it was.

2016
02:54:20,460 --> 02:54:22,540
Every time she would claim that I'm only defending a woman because we hooked up on the blah, blah,

2017
02:54:22,540 --> 02:54:25,980
blah, but I can't be public on the fact that we hooked up. So between him live and Anna,

2018
02:54:25,980 --> 02:54:29,020
now he has in his head, he's built up this archetype and his head up. This is what Steven

2019
02:54:29,020 --> 02:54:32,300
does to people. I've got two women here who maybe feel abused or mistreated by his community.

2020
02:54:32,300 --> 02:54:35,900
And then what he's doing is he's trying to find every other girl that I've spoken to,

2021
02:54:35,900 --> 02:54:42,140
to see if that he could get similar stories out of them. Now, I don't know how many women he's

2022
02:54:42,140 --> 02:54:46,220
talked to so far, 10 or 20 or 30 or more. I know that he's been trying desperately to get in

2023
02:54:46,220 --> 02:54:49,820
contact with people like Denims and Bad Bunny. I know that he's messaged a ton of people asking

2024
02:54:49,820 --> 02:54:53,820
for lists of women that I've spoken to. I know that when I found this out two days ago, I started

2025
02:54:53,820 --> 02:54:56,460
going down my list of friends and right clicking and doing the properties. And I suddenly started

2026
02:54:56,460 --> 02:55:00,460
to notice that Mr. Girl was mutual friends with every single girl on my friends list that I've

2027
02:55:00,460 --> 02:55:03,980
ever spoken to. And I think what he's doing, and I can't prove this, I don't know, but if anybody

2028
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:05,900
wants to come for a show, I think what he's doing is he's calling all of these people in the

2029
02:55:05,900 --> 02:55:09,020
background. And I think that he's asking them through long conversations or trying to convince

2030
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:14,380
them that I'm doing something improper or wrong. Wow.

2031
02:55:14,380 --> 02:55:17,980
This is extra frustrating for a few different- That might be a spot.

2032
02:55:18,540 --> 02:55:20,140
Yeah. What do you think of that?

2033
02:55:24,300 --> 02:55:31,980
Basically disgusting. I don't know how else to say it. Destiny is Max's lifeline for a career. So

2034
02:55:31,980 --> 02:55:35,660
people are trying to be like, Max is just trying to gain more clout. He's just going on another

2035
02:55:35,660 --> 02:55:40,380
attack to save his career. I don't know if it's that simple. Max is convinced that he's the

2036
02:55:40,380 --> 02:55:47,980
righteous moral crusader. And he holds to this probably unhealthily and he will do so at the

2037
02:55:47,980 --> 02:55:54,140
cost of his career. I think that's evident because attacking Destiny, like Destiny probably has,

2038
02:55:55,340 --> 02:56:00,140
doesn't he use Destiny's website formatting and all this sorts of stuff? He's his last lifeline

2039
02:56:00,140 --> 02:56:06,540
on YouTube. He made his career in a lot of ways. So I really do see it as like this moral crusade,

2040
02:56:07,500 --> 02:56:11,420
but rather than giving his friend any level of benefit of the doubt, not just like friend.

2041
02:56:14,380 --> 02:56:19,740
Like Destiny just said that he opened up, he said, I'm going to try doing friendship because people

2042
02:56:19,740 --> 02:56:24,620
told me that that's the right thing to do to be more of a human. So I opened up and was vulnerable

2043
02:56:24,620 --> 02:56:30,780
with Max and Lav and a couple of other people. And so for Max to like, know that Max has

2044
02:56:30,780 --> 02:56:36,060
ultimately regularly said that Steven is like shut down, that he's like got problems in his

2045
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:42,700
relationships. And then to do this behind Steven's back is like the ultimate betrayal of friendship

2046
02:56:42,700 --> 02:56:49,180
in like a pretty extreme way. And I think it's gross. Like, I think it's actually really gross.

2047
02:56:49,180 --> 02:56:55,020
And the problem is that like Max is not the champion for women. He was never be a champion

2048
02:56:55,020 --> 02:56:59,580
that I would select for women. Every woman who has been on stream, who has disagreed with them,

2049
02:56:59,580 --> 02:57:05,980
he has aggressively attacked. I have been doxxed. I have had my work companies contacted by some of

2050
02:57:05,980 --> 02:57:11,980
his crazy fans. I have had multiple of his fans from burner counts send me nasty things to me

2051
02:57:11,980 --> 02:57:18,220
and Steven. I've been attacked ruthlessly by his fans. And in large part, most of the questioning

2052
02:57:18,220 --> 02:57:23,100
about my credentials comes in large part from Max. And a lot of people basically saying that

2053
02:57:23,100 --> 02:57:27,500
I have no salt to stand on, that I have no credence to anything I say on psychology

2054
02:57:27,500 --> 02:57:32,220
is in large part from him. He's basically implied that I am worse than a rape apologist within

2055
02:57:32,220 --> 02:57:38,380
psychology and that clients aren't safe with me, right? Like, and this isn't just me. Then

2056
02:57:39,420 --> 02:57:43,500
Brittany Simon disagreed with him on things. He went on the attack with her, right? The first

2057
02:57:43,500 --> 02:57:47,500
time that like Stardust basically like put up a fucking boundary with him, he went on the attack

2058
02:57:47,500 --> 02:57:53,180
with her instead of weaponizing her like previous lice experiences against her to get the boundary

2059
02:57:53,180 --> 02:57:57,740
to go down, which is, she just said, I just like, I just need to cool down and blah, blah, blah,

2060
02:57:57,740 --> 02:58:01,580
and to like make his major point. Like he has this consistent pattern with women that it's like,

2061
02:58:01,580 --> 02:58:07,660
don't you fucking now use women's experiences to try to attack your friend because you're mad that

2062
02:58:07,660 --> 02:58:13,500
you got banned on his discord. Don't fucking do it. It's not a moral crusade. It's a petty fight

2063
02:58:13,500 --> 02:58:20,140
that you're making worse. And it's fucking gross. It's insane to me. This is insane. I can't like,

2064
02:58:20,140 --> 02:58:27,900
this is worse than Boston Hassan combined for sure. Um, I entirely agree with everything that

2065
02:58:27,900 --> 02:58:33,900
you've said. Do you mind if I steal me on the other side for a bit? Sure. Go for it. Okay.

2066
02:58:38,300 --> 02:58:41,020
Going, going back to the start of the stream, when I said something like,

2067
02:58:41,740 --> 02:58:45,180
if you have a belief about the world to you, it's not a belief. It's the way the world is.

2068
02:58:47,420 --> 02:58:54,860
If Max genuinely believed in his, in his deepest heart of hearts, that destiny actually was some

2069
02:58:54,860 --> 02:59:00,940
sort of abuser, and he was going to go on what he thinks is actually a righteous crusade against

2070
02:59:00,940 --> 02:59:05,100
women, or sorry, against destiny for all the women he's abused and he's collecting all this evidence.

2071
02:59:05,420 --> 02:59:09,900
It seems like this would be exactly how a person like that would behave.

2072
02:59:13,820 --> 02:59:17,260
He would be calling these people and he would be talking to them and he'd be trying to

2073
02:59:17,260 --> 02:59:26,060
understand what's going on. So it's, it's, it's not immediately obvious to me that he's,

2074
02:59:26,060 --> 02:59:29,580
that he's just evil. He might actually believe this stuff delusionally.

2075
02:59:29,580 --> 02:59:38,060
The issue is if you believe in a self lie to the extent that it does an unabashed amount of damage

2076
02:59:38,060 --> 02:59:44,860
to everyone around you, at what point do we not say, I don't know if I still want to say evil,

2077
02:59:44,860 --> 02:59:49,980
evil is a really big word, but how do we not say this is obviously deeply wrong?

2078
02:59:51,980 --> 02:59:57,660
Yeah, I, I, I do tend to agree with you there. I mean, I'm, I'm trying to see it from his point

2079
02:59:57,660 --> 03:00:01,740
of view. I know that's why I want you here. Fucking base gig at Chad steel manner.

2080
03:00:03,100 --> 03:00:06,940
And, and like, even from his point of view, like, let's say that max actually believes this,

2081
03:00:06,940 --> 03:00:10,380
and let's say he calls up a dozen of these women and a dozen of these women are like,

2082
03:00:10,380 --> 03:00:14,460
no, man, everything's fine. I'm sure at least some of them have said that if it actually has

2083
03:00:14,460 --> 03:00:18,060
been 20 or 30 women, I'm sure at least a few of them have said things are fine. I think,

2084
03:00:18,060 --> 03:00:26,300
I think you reach a point where enough evidence independent of your, your own biases and your own

2085
03:00:26,300 --> 03:00:32,300
biases in your own, your own viewpoint, you know, your own subjectivity and enough real world

2086
03:00:32,300 --> 03:00:38,140
evidence to stack up that maybe you start questioning your hypothesis. Right. I guess

2087
03:00:38,140 --> 03:00:41,820
basically I would say like there are reasonable lease and unreasonable beliefs and a rational

2088
03:00:41,820 --> 03:00:48,140
actor must be held account for their unreasonable beliefs, particularly if your unreasonable beliefs

2089
03:00:48,140 --> 03:00:52,460
are being targeted and aimed towards somebody that you claimed, I will never betray you.

2090
03:00:52,460 --> 03:00:58,060
And who you claimed is a good friend of yours and that you love, right? This is not what love

2091
03:00:58,060 --> 03:01:03,660
looks like eat land. Like here's the thing. Let's assume that he does think that this is going on

2092
03:01:03,660 --> 03:01:10,220
when you love somebody and they've, and they're doing a really bad thing that a loving person

2093
03:01:10,220 --> 03:01:13,500
still addresses the behavior. I'm not saying that if he actually thinks that this is going on,

2094
03:01:13,500 --> 03:01:17,020
that he should just yes, man, and dismissed it. Let's, let's assume in the worst case that he

2095
03:01:17,020 --> 03:01:21,660
act like, cause I believe that he does believe this to some degree. And he actually is worried

2096
03:01:21,660 --> 03:01:27,820
that there's like an abuse pattern that's being established here, but this is also a friend that

2097
03:01:27,820 --> 03:01:35,020
you love. So the question is, if you're actually thinking in any way about a person that you love

2098
03:01:35,020 --> 03:01:42,300
and the victims and being responsible with the enormity of the claims that you're trying to make

2099
03:01:42,300 --> 03:01:49,180
and putting together a reasonable actor does not act in this way. This to me looks like

2100
03:01:49,180 --> 03:01:57,260
petulant behavior driven by anger and motivated thinking to construe a re a narrative based on

2101
03:01:57,260 --> 03:02:06,700
his unreasonable belief in a situation. Yeah. And that's the problem. Yeah.

2102
03:02:07,660 --> 03:02:11,420
That or max is crazy enough to just be disregarded. But if we're going to take his claim

2103
03:02:11,420 --> 03:02:15,820
seriously at all, then we have to seriously look at how he's behaving. And if you're

2104
03:02:15,820 --> 03:02:22,300
making this size of claim against somebody, you claim that you love with potentially abuse,

2105
03:02:22,300 --> 03:02:27,820
sexual abuse, allegations of multiple women, you owe it to the women and to your friend to be as

2106
03:02:27,820 --> 03:02:32,300
maximally responsible as possible. And in no way is this maximally responsible.

2107
03:02:33,420 --> 03:02:39,100
Okay. I think I've, I think, I think, I think my brain just expanded a size or two here. Okay.

2108
03:02:39,340 --> 03:02:45,500
Okay. All right. One of the, one of the Yudowskian things that I learned when I was studying that

2109
03:02:45,500 --> 03:02:51,660
sort of stuff was an argument that he called privileging the hypothesis and privileging

2110
03:02:51,660 --> 03:02:57,740
hypothesis. It goes something like this. Okay. It's something like, let's say you live in a city

2111
03:02:57,740 --> 03:03:02,780
with a million people. Okay. And then a murder happens in the city. And then it's your job to

2112
03:03:02,780 --> 03:03:08,140
figure out who who's the murderer. And you have no evidence at all. You have no evidence about

2113
03:03:08,140 --> 03:03:13,180
who could, who could the murderer, the murderer me. And then you decide to say, I think it's you,

2114
03:03:13,180 --> 03:03:16,060
Dev. You point the finger at me. You're the murderer. And I'm like, Oh, I'm the murderer.

2115
03:03:16,060 --> 03:03:20,380
You're pointing me out. I'm the murderer. With no, with no proof at all. You just have a hypothesis

2116
03:03:20,380 --> 03:03:27,180
that it might be me. And then it comes out later that a witness saw that the murderer had brown

2117
03:03:27,180 --> 03:03:36,060
hair and I have brown hair. So now you're like, Oh, my hypothesis was correct. Dev has brown hair.

2118
03:03:36,060 --> 03:03:39,980
I think he's the murderer. The murderer had brown hair. And so now you start running,

2119
03:03:39,980 --> 03:03:45,020
you start investigating and you start finding more evidence that pins me as the murderer. Now,

2120
03:03:45,020 --> 03:03:50,620
in reality, I wasn't the murderer, but because you started with a faulty hypothesis, your

2121
03:03:50,620 --> 03:03:56,060
investigation is going to naturally lead you in a way that makes you think like you're, you're

2122
03:03:56,060 --> 03:04:00,140
getting at the truth, but you're actually not. Yes. And so this is why I would say here, not

2123
03:04:00,140 --> 03:04:05,420
being in that case, you're engaging in motivated thinking. If you actually want to take a charge

2124
03:04:05,420 --> 03:04:09,980
of murder seriously, or sexual abuse seriously, you need to do better thinking than that. And

2125
03:04:09,980 --> 03:04:15,500
you're responsible for being a fool in your process. For example, if he genuinely thought

2126
03:04:15,500 --> 03:04:20,780
that this was serious, why didn't he approach women who he knows that he has contention with

2127
03:04:20,780 --> 03:04:26,700
and is maybe somewhat more warm towards destiny to vet the opposing side. For example, why didn't

2128
03:04:26,700 --> 03:04:32,540
he approach me or somebody else who's maybe more friendly, right? It's very market. The women that

2129
03:04:32,540 --> 03:04:40,380
are getting included, um, by like at least Lav and Max, that to me is extremely suspicious and begs

2130
03:04:40,380 --> 03:04:45,820
that there's motivated thinking, if not intentionally being done, horrifically,

2131
03:04:45,820 --> 03:04:52,540
irrationally done to a level that is basically disregardable. And if it is intentionally done

2132
03:04:52,540 --> 03:04:57,500
and he realizes that there are certain people who will not yes, man, his story, and he's not

2133
03:04:57,500 --> 03:05:00,780
approaching them. Now you're now you're a malicious actor.

2134
03:05:02,380 --> 03:05:08,860
Yeah, yeah. So you see this a lot in like the, the YouTube video essayist community,

2135
03:05:08,860 --> 03:05:13,980
where people will find that they will find evidence, real evidence that suits their their

2136
03:05:13,980 --> 03:05:19,340
views. And then they'll present that evidence in a very responsible way. But evidence that

2137
03:05:19,340 --> 03:05:23,180
specifically goes against their views, they won't present it at all, the pretend doesn't exist.

2138
03:05:23,180 --> 03:05:28,620
And so they go down one tree of logic, and they come to correct conclusions, and they have

2139
03:05:28,620 --> 03:05:33,820
correct ideas. But they're completely ignoring everything else that is also true that causes

2140
03:05:33,820 --> 03:05:40,780
them problems. And when it comes to a more serious thing like this, where you're accusing somebody of

2141
03:05:40,780 --> 03:05:46,700
something you kind of have to have you have to, you have to explore all the ways in which you

2142
03:05:46,700 --> 03:05:52,700
might be wrong. Before you start like going on the warpath, you know what I mean? And if you don't,

2143
03:05:52,780 --> 03:05:58,060
then it just it seems like you have a preset idea that you're that you're you're privileging

2144
03:05:58,060 --> 03:06:02,460
the hypothesis. That's what my this area of the internet that I'm in calls it.

2145
03:06:04,300 --> 03:06:08,780
Which is why it's very good that you're here to steal land against me because I want to be as

2146
03:06:09,500 --> 03:06:16,860
doing my best. But to not do that, I'm glad it's useful. Acknowledge my biases. Number one,

2147
03:06:16,860 --> 03:06:21,580
I've had a growing frustration with Max, I exchange him a massive margin of error,

2148
03:06:21,580 --> 03:06:26,460
even after he treated me horrifically twice and then refused to engage with me on anything but

2149
03:06:26,460 --> 03:06:32,300
the thing where he wanted to basically berate me over. And I was still charitable towards him. In

2150
03:06:32,300 --> 03:06:37,660
fact, I did a documentary still speaking decently, warmly about him. And then I watched how we treated

2151
03:06:37,660 --> 03:06:45,420
Stardust. And then I watched how he treated Steven in the past stuff. And I will admit,

2152
03:06:45,420 --> 03:06:51,180
I have a strong disdain for him now. So I am definitely biased against Max. And Steven is

2153
03:06:51,180 --> 03:06:55,660
a good friend of mine, genuinely a good friend, like on and off stream. And no, we're not fucking

2154
03:06:55,660 --> 03:07:04,620
sexual. It's very hard to find a tonic mature older streamers to be friends with. I'm sure

2155
03:07:04,620 --> 03:07:10,220
you probably know that personally. And so I think they somewhat cling to one another.

2156
03:07:11,100 --> 03:07:14,620
It is it is less of a problem with me because I'm a guy but I do know what you mean. Yeah.

2157
03:07:14,620 --> 03:07:18,380
Yeah, yeah. Brittany Sime is another person that I would say I'm personally friends with

2158
03:07:18,380 --> 03:07:22,140
off stream as well. She's very, very mature and whatnot.

2159
03:07:22,940 --> 03:07:24,380
Really? She's kind of out there.

2160
03:07:25,740 --> 03:07:31,980
She's got strange ideas, but she's like, a very good person, like a deeply, deeply good person.

2161
03:07:31,980 --> 03:07:35,340
She's got some bad ideas. And like, there's certain things where I could be like, okay,

2162
03:07:35,340 --> 03:07:42,700
Brittany, fuck, don't say that shit. Like, Jesus. Yeah, but she does care. Okay,

2163
03:07:42,700 --> 03:07:45,660
let's keep going. Everyone's like, we're like an hour behind now.

2164
03:07:46,060 --> 03:07:52,060
reasons. One is because there are some people that Mr. Girl, I think can only confront because

2165
03:07:52,060 --> 03:07:56,060
of very personal, very private information that I've told him. So he's taken that information.

2166
03:07:56,060 --> 03:07:59,660
And he's basically used it to lie to other people or attack me in the background, which is

2167
03:07:59,660 --> 03:08:02,860
very frustrating, because it's very rare that I share a secret with somebody don't have very many.

2168
03:08:03,900 --> 03:08:09,260
Wait, wait, wait, hold on. He's taken girl, I think can only confront because of very personal,

2169
03:08:09,260 --> 03:08:13,020
very private information that I've told him. So he's taken that information. And he's basically

2170
03:08:13,020 --> 03:08:16,540
used it to lie to other people or attack me in the background, which is very frustrating,

2171
03:08:16,540 --> 03:08:19,740
because it's very rare that I share a secret with home. Did you hear that?

2172
03:08:20,540 --> 03:08:25,660
Yep. Yep. That's, that's pretty rough. Fuck that. This is even worse than that. Fuck everything.

2173
03:08:25,660 --> 03:08:30,300
I'm like trying to be like, let's try to hear the other side, but holy fuck. Can you imagine

2174
03:08:30,940 --> 03:08:35,580
somebody with trust issues finally opens up, tells you very personal information,

2175
03:08:35,580 --> 03:08:40,780
and then you weaponize that against them elsewhere in a private space. What the fuck is wrong with

2176
03:08:40,780 --> 03:08:45,100
you? Does destiny of trust, trust issues? I don't know that about him.

2177
03:08:48,060 --> 03:08:52,540
Uh, I would say so. I would say any streamer last in this space for too long.

2178
03:08:52,540 --> 03:08:57,980
It's probably pretty big. Trust. I mean, I mean, I don't. I mean, I've been here for a while. And

2179
03:08:58,540 --> 03:09:01,420
I've had multiple cancelings and backstabbings. But I mean, I'm,

2180
03:09:02,140 --> 03:09:06,700
I can, you know what, I maybe I'm just unique. I consider everyone I talk to a friend until they

2181
03:09:06,700 --> 03:09:10,220
show me they're not a friend. So I have many friends. Also, the world's better that way when

2182
03:09:10,220 --> 03:09:14,620
I have many friends. I feel like I, somebody just said, did you say Brittany has bad ideas?

2183
03:09:14,620 --> 03:09:18,380
I don't think actually Brittany has bad ideas. Um, I think that she has ideas that she doesn't

2184
03:09:18,380 --> 03:09:22,060
always communicate super well. So people understand them, but actually a lot of her

2185
03:09:22,060 --> 03:09:27,260
ideas are really, really interesting and smart and cool. So yeah. Oh, sounds neat.

2186
03:09:31,980 --> 03:09:36,540
So that's one thing that's very irritating. And then two, cause I think I was genuinely like a

2187
03:09:36,540 --> 03:09:39,900
pretty good friend to Max and Lav. Although I guess they both don't feel that way because

2188
03:09:39,900 --> 03:09:44,860
my subreddit should have them for awhile. Um, but like, I'm not sure, I guess in the future,

2189
03:09:44,860 --> 03:09:49,420
I need to write like strict rules for, um, I need to write strict rules for how people are going to

2190
03:09:49,420 --> 03:09:52,140
interact with me on stream or something, because I guess if the subreddit is mean to them for a few

2191
03:09:52,140 --> 03:09:54,940
days, they're going to lose their fucking mind. I guess a quick steel man, a quick steel man,

2192
03:09:54,940 --> 03:09:59,580
I could probably insert here is something like a lot of whenever you have like viewers interacting

2193
03:09:59,580 --> 03:10:03,260
with streamers or, or small YouTubers are interacting with large YouTubers, there's

2194
03:10:03,260 --> 03:10:09,260
definitely a knee jerk reaction. That's pretty common that if the personality themselves treats

2195
03:10:09,260 --> 03:10:14,940
you well, but their audience treats you poorly, that reflects on the personality. And I don't

2196
03:10:14,940 --> 03:10:19,180
think that's fair, but I think it's common. Yeah. And there's this trick where like,

2197
03:10:19,180 --> 03:10:22,700
how much are you accountable to your community? Like how much is the community reflection of you?

2198
03:10:22,700 --> 03:10:27,260
Cause I think it is to some extent of reflection of you. Um, the issue is that

2199
03:10:28,540 --> 03:10:33,340
destiny is somebody who's very critical. He's critical of his friends and he's critical of

2200
03:10:33,340 --> 03:10:38,700
the world. And he tends to be very open about that. I mean, he, I remember like the first,

2201
03:10:38,700 --> 03:10:42,140
one of the first times we had like a, a chat, like one-on-one, he was like, I need you to be

2202
03:10:42,140 --> 03:10:46,940
warned that I'm a big asshole. So like, I don't want to, I don't want to mince words about that.

2203
03:10:46,940 --> 03:10:50,860
It's super fair if that's like, not for you, but I'm not like, I'm not going to pretend,

2204
03:10:50,860 --> 03:10:54,380
just, I really want you to understand that. And that's like, I've watched your, a bit of your

2205
03:10:54,380 --> 03:10:59,340
content. I'm fully aware that you're an asshole. Um, right. He's very, very blunt and dry and like

2206
03:10:59,340 --> 03:11:03,580
prone to criticism and not very prone to compliments as well. Right. Because in many

2207
03:11:03,580 --> 03:11:08,380
ways, this is a projection of Steven. He doesn't find compliments meaningful and he finds criticisms

2208
03:11:08,380 --> 03:11:13,500
helpful and interesting and kind of fun. Right. And so like, he only offers what he kind of

2209
03:11:13,500 --> 03:11:17,180
appreciates, but the problem is that that's not the same for everyone else, which he realizes,

2210
03:11:17,180 --> 03:11:21,580
but it's hard to operate outside of your own, like essentially quote unquote, love language.

2211
03:11:22,780 --> 03:11:26,220
That, that sounds kind of like me too, but I do like compliments from my girlfriend,

2212
03:11:26,220 --> 03:11:30,300
at least that's nice. That's true. But yeah, like I also see, I also someone who

2213
03:11:30,300 --> 03:11:35,660
I also love when Naomi compliments me. Oh, Oh, okay. I see how it is.

2214
03:11:39,020 --> 03:11:43,740
Yeah. Um, Oh, this is so bad and sad.

2215
03:11:44,540 --> 03:11:46,220
That entire fucking stream with erudite was fucking disgusting,

2216
03:11:46,220 --> 03:11:48,620
where he's pushing to share shit with him to prove that you love him. Yeah. It's pretty weird.

2217
03:11:48,620 --> 03:11:51,580
But, um, I think at the end of the day, I think that he's just like, again, highly narcissistic,

2218
03:11:51,580 --> 03:11:55,500
highly manipulative. And, um, yeah, that's kind of what, that's just what he does.

2219
03:11:56,380 --> 03:11:58,940
How many different people did you confirm that he contacted? Uh, I'm not gonna release numbers

2220
03:11:58,940 --> 03:12:01,580
because I don't really want him to know what I know. Is he doing this because of the subreddit

2221
03:12:01,580 --> 03:12:04,700
stuff? I don't really know what flipped the switch in his mind. Do you have any evidence or receipts?

2222
03:12:04,700 --> 03:12:07,660
I have a ton of evidence and a ton of receipts. Of course. I'm not gonna go public with something

2223
03:12:07,660 --> 03:12:11,100
like this with somebody that shady without obviously having some idea of what's actually

2224
03:12:11,100 --> 03:12:15,740
going on in the background manifesto time. Oh, I don't really want to quote any of these in

2225
03:12:15,740 --> 03:12:19,020
particular because I don't want him to know who sent me stuff, but he used phrases alluding to

2226
03:12:19,020 --> 03:12:23,020
the fact that I like very carefully choose which women I want to victimize. Um, he's repeated this

2227
03:12:23,020 --> 03:12:26,140
pattern that like, my goal is to abuse women by bringing them on stream and having my community

2228
03:12:26,140 --> 03:12:29,420
make fun of them after I fuck them. Um, you had laugh today, alluding to the fact that I guess

2229
03:12:29,420 --> 03:12:31,980
I'm Harvey Weinstein on stream because I have sex with a lot of people that come through my

2230
03:12:31,980 --> 03:12:36,620
community, which I'm gonna do. But, um, the, the way that I always kind of saw it going in my head

2231
03:12:36,620 --> 03:12:40,780
is if anybody ever tried to me to me, um, all I would ever say to that person is like, Hey, listen,

2232
03:12:40,780 --> 03:12:43,580
Oh, you think I was improper? Okay. Well leak all of our DMS. Or if you don't want to, I will

2233
03:12:43,580 --> 03:12:49,660
leak our entire DM history. Um, because I always figured that like, obviously, um, I usually have

2234
03:12:49,660 --> 03:12:52,300
really candid conversations about like my expectations for people like sexually or

2235
03:12:52,300 --> 03:12:55,900
whatever. Um, so like, like for instance, these are messages that I sent back to lab in August.

2236
03:12:55,900 --> 03:12:58,700
Okay. Early August. I don't know how many months ago that is. So like, I'll literally say things

2237
03:12:58,700 --> 03:13:01,260
like, Oh, Hey, just because you've been on stream more and whatnot. I know we've had some kind of

2238
03:13:01,260 --> 03:13:03,740
sexual conversations in the past, but you being on my stream or the way they interact with you

2239
03:13:03,740 --> 03:13:06,380
never has anything to do with any of that kind of stuff. Just being clear on that. She says

2240
03:13:06,380 --> 03:13:09,100
something and I say, I'm just saying, don't feel like any of your interactions are contingent on

2241
03:13:09,100 --> 03:13:11,260
anything like that. You're fine doing whatever. So don't you feel like I'm keeping you around

2242
03:13:11,260 --> 03:13:13,900
for anything related to sex, et cetera. Like I usually have very, very, very explicit

2243
03:13:13,900 --> 03:13:18,300
conversations with almost everybody about stuff like this. Um, I'll say it, I'll set it a million

2244
03:13:18,300 --> 03:13:22,300
times. If anybody out there, any woman ever feels like I'm being improper, feel free to like show

2245
03:13:22,300 --> 03:13:25,180
in DMS where I'm pressuring you or growing your journey, where she like that, those DMS don't

2246
03:13:25,180 --> 03:13:28,940
exist because it doesn't happen. Um, the only thing that I'm a little bit worried about when

2247
03:13:28,940 --> 03:13:33,980
it comes to max is because he's so manipulative. The, the, um, the struggle that I have is that I

2248
03:13:33,980 --> 03:13:38,220
think he probably could get like, I actually want to speak to this. So a lot of people assume that

2249
03:13:38,220 --> 03:13:42,620
we're having sex, which I will never fully be able to dispel. I actually want to say there was

2250
03:13:42,620 --> 03:13:46,940
one moment where we flirted a little bit in like very low key. And I imagine he won't care about

2251
03:13:46,940 --> 03:13:51,020
this. And then he immediately was like, Hey, just so you know, I don't know what the boundaries are.

2252
03:13:51,020 --> 03:13:54,220
And I want to be really careful. Cause I realized you're married and I don't want to make you or

2253
03:13:54,220 --> 03:13:57,740
Nick uncomfortable at any point. So I just need you to like explicitly tell me like,

2254
03:13:57,740 --> 03:14:00,940
what are the boundaries in lines are? And I was like, Oh yeah, Nick. And I think that like

2255
03:14:00,940 --> 03:14:05,260
flirting is like just another form of like kind of social communication. Um, it would probably

2256
03:14:05,260 --> 03:14:09,420
never go beyond that for me personally. Um, so like that would be basically my line is there's

2257
03:14:09,420 --> 03:14:12,860
like, never, this would never escalate to anything ever. And I would never want it assumed on the

2258
03:14:12,860 --> 03:14:17,100
table more or less. And he was like, okay, based. And now we don't even do that. We're just,

2259
03:14:17,100 --> 03:14:23,100
we're just actually just like fully platonic friends. Right. Right. Yeah. Um,

2260
03:14:23,900 --> 03:14:27,980
Hmm. Can you rewind it to 30 seconds? If you don't mind. Yeah.

2261
03:14:30,780 --> 03:14:33,900
Just being clear on that. Okay. Early August. I don't know how many months ago that is. So like,

2262
03:14:33,900 --> 03:14:36,460
I'll literally say things like, Oh, Hey, just because you've been on stream more and whatnot.

2263
03:14:36,460 --> 03:14:38,940
I know we've had some kind of sexual conversations in the past, but you being on my stream or the way

2264
03:14:38,940 --> 03:14:41,580
they interact with you never has anything to do with any of that kind of stuff. Just being clear

2265
03:14:41,580 --> 03:14:44,460
on that. She says something and I say, I'm just saying, don't feel like any of your interactions

2266
03:14:44,460 --> 03:14:46,860
are contingent on anything like that. You're fine doing whatever. So when you feel like I'm keeping

2267
03:14:46,860 --> 03:14:49,740
you around for anything related to sex, et cetera, like I usually have very, very, very explicit

2268
03:14:49,740 --> 03:14:54,140
conversations with almost everybody about stuff like this. Um, I'll say it, I'll set it a million

2269
03:14:54,140 --> 03:14:58,140
times. If anybody out there, any woman ever feels like I'm being improper, feel free to like show

2270
03:14:58,140 --> 03:15:01,420
in DMS where I'm pressuring you or growing or doing research like that. Those DMS don't exist

2271
03:15:01,420 --> 03:15:05,340
because it doesn't happen. Um, the only thing that I'm a little bit worried about when it comes to

2272
03:15:05,340 --> 03:15:13,180
max is because he's, um, it's a, it's a strange phenomenon, but I've had at least a dozen people

2273
03:15:13,180 --> 03:15:17,900
over the course of, since my channel, you know, hit over a hundred thousand subs,

2274
03:15:17,900 --> 03:15:24,300
at least a dozen people send me nudes unprompted. Um, and it's always very strange. I don't know how

2275
03:15:24,300 --> 03:15:28,060
to deal with that. You know, it's like, okay, that's, you know, giga chat. I got some nudes,

2276
03:15:28,060 --> 03:15:32,060
but like in actuality, it's very strange. I don't, I don't know what to do with that. I don't know

2277
03:15:32,060 --> 03:15:39,500
what to say. And you know, there, you know, you can't, there's a power dynamic that comes with

2278
03:15:39,500 --> 03:15:46,060
when you're talking to someone that you look up to that I think some, there may be some personality

2279
03:15:46,060 --> 03:15:50,540
types of people or some, some types of people, something, some people, they, they're just going

2280
03:15:50,540 --> 03:15:56,700
to always feel coerced, even if you're not trying to, you know, so generally, and I've learned that

2281
03:15:56,700 --> 03:16:03,900
through a few bad experiences of my own. So I generally just like, don't reply, just a safety,

2282
03:16:03,900 --> 03:16:07,820
you know, it was not somebody I know, it was just like a random new drop. I'm just like, nope,

2283
03:16:07,820 --> 03:16:12,300
not going to reply to that because I could be like, Oh, that's great. Send me some more. And

2284
03:16:12,300 --> 03:16:15,820
then they might feel pressured to do it. Or I can say like, Oh, thank you. Or Oh, don't send me

2285
03:16:15,820 --> 03:16:22,700
that. And it feels like nothing I can say, is ever a good thing to say. Because that it might

2286
03:16:22,700 --> 03:16:29,180
be the kind of person who just who, I don't know, do you know what I'm saying? I do understand what

2287
03:16:29,180 --> 03:16:35,100
you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know it, too, I guess to even then, though, like, it doesn't

2288
03:16:35,100 --> 03:16:39,980
really excuse any of this behavior. But it may be the case that some people just by virtue of

2289
03:16:39,980 --> 03:16:45,100
interacting with destiny feel pressured, even if he's not being pressuring, you know?

2290
03:16:46,940 --> 03:16:55,740
Yes, I understand that the problem is, at some point when consent is being negotiated explicitly,

2291
03:16:55,740 --> 03:16:59,980
if you're still feeling some sort of way, and the other actor has shown to you that they're

2292
03:16:59,980 --> 03:17:04,780
very comfortable with an explicit exchange, it's fundamentally on you to voice that. And I know

2293
03:17:04,780 --> 03:17:09,420
that sounds like literally been blaming. But the reality is, like, I literally can't imagine a

2294
03:17:09,420 --> 03:17:14,860
world. Because, first of all, because of students trust issues, there's no world in which a girl

2295
03:17:14,860 --> 03:17:18,220
would text and be like, just you know, I'm feeling a little bit pressured, like sexually, I'm not

2296
03:17:18,220 --> 03:17:23,020
sure I'm comfortable with this, where Steve would ever be like, what do you mean? Come on, like,

2297
03:17:23,020 --> 03:17:29,340
I can't even picture it. And to be honest, if it had happened, so many people hate this motherfucker

2298
03:17:29,340 --> 03:17:33,740
that it would have been leaked by now. Like you would be the most popular girl on the internet,

2299
03:17:33,740 --> 03:17:38,620
like overnight, if you had that fucking content. The reality is, like, I'm sure he's very aware of

2300
03:17:38,620 --> 03:17:43,420
optics seems like he's very intense about consent. And he's pretty explicit about consent as well.

2301
03:17:43,420 --> 03:17:47,740
So it's just like at some point, if you're still feeling like some level of innate pressure,

2302
03:17:47,740 --> 03:17:52,620
it is on you to voice that or to step away. Like you have to negotiate this with it.

2303
03:17:53,340 --> 03:17:56,940
Yes, by the way, you pause at the great the greatest frame that is a good face.

2304
03:17:57,900 --> 03:18:03,340
So manipulative, the struggle that I have is that I think he probably could get like two or

2305
03:18:03,340 --> 03:18:06,220
three girls like fucked out of their head, and like, try to get them on stream. Like, oh, yeah,

2306
03:18:06,220 --> 03:18:08,620
actually, you know, I think about this, it's kind of feels like really bad, because his community

2307
03:18:08,620 --> 03:18:11,820
made fun of me or some shit. And even if I have a really good response, if I get like three or four

2308
03:18:11,820 --> 03:18:14,460
girls in a row that all have these types of like emotional stories, it just makes me look bad, no

2309
03:18:14,460 --> 03:18:18,380
matter what. I will say that it's extra frustrating that Max is trying to do to me, basically, what

2310
03:18:18,380 --> 03:18:21,500
Sherry and Stardust did to him except on a much lesser level, where he like talks to people, hikes

2311
03:18:21,500 --> 03:18:24,140
them up, tries to convince them that they were abused, and then tries to get them out. And then

2312
03:18:24,140 --> 03:18:25,980
talks to people, hikes them up, tries to convince them that they were abused,

2313
03:18:25,980 --> 03:18:28,060
and then tries to get them out. I also think it's really gross that,

2314
03:18:28,060 --> 03:18:31,100
despite me and Anna's past shit, me and Anna have been like relatively chill, I think,

2315
03:18:31,100 --> 03:18:33,020
for like the past year. I haven't had any complaints about her, no problems or whatever.

2316
03:18:33,020 --> 03:18:35,180
Obviously, I think she did better in the past. She thinks I've been better in the past. I haven't

2317
03:18:35,180 --> 03:18:38,780
really had any problems with her for like, I don't know, for like a year or more. But Max has

2318
03:18:38,780 --> 03:18:42,140
been talking to her a lot in the background now. And I noticed that she's starting to echo a lot

2319
03:18:42,140 --> 03:18:46,300
of what Max has told her to me and to other people in DMs. So basically, her, Max, and Lav have been

2320
03:18:46,300 --> 03:18:49,660
running around in DMs in the background, basically talking to a ton of people to try to see if there

2321
03:18:49,660 --> 03:18:52,300
are people that I've sexually abused or manipulated or anything like that.

2322
03:18:55,740 --> 03:19:00,780
There's another really big thing here that this is kind of, there's this really weird misnomer

2323
03:19:00,780 --> 03:19:05,020
around ethics specifically, where people feel like if something is risky, it's inherently also

2324
03:19:05,020 --> 03:19:11,260
unethical. The issue is riskiness isn't inherently unethical. It's only unethical if you take a risk

2325
03:19:11,260 --> 03:19:15,900
and it ends really poorly for somebody. Now it is retroactively unethical, and you're going to be

2326
03:19:15,900 --> 03:19:21,180
in big fucking shit, but also sometimes people will take risks and it will work out very well

2327
03:19:21,180 --> 03:19:25,900
for all better things. So like power differentials creates a risky situation. There is a little bit

2328
03:19:25,900 --> 03:19:31,740
more complex, unspeakable factors that even if you gain explicit consent, always exists in this kind

2329
03:19:31,740 --> 03:19:35,660
of abstract, amorphous thing that you can't navigate. The reality though, is that power

2330
03:19:35,660 --> 03:19:40,940
dynamics and sexual relationships do and can exist all the time. And a lot of times it's completely

2331
03:19:40,940 --> 03:19:46,380
healthy. For example, a very common power differential relationship is men who have sex

2332
03:19:46,380 --> 03:19:52,060
and date women, because there is always a power differential between the muscle and physical

2333
03:19:52,060 --> 03:19:56,700
capacity of a man compared to a woman. But that doesn't make it unethical that the man is having

2334
03:19:56,700 --> 03:20:00,220
sex with the woman. And it doesn't make it a problem that they form a relationship. It means

2335
03:20:00,220 --> 03:20:05,020
that there's a higher responsibility on the person with the greater power in specifically that

2336
03:20:05,020 --> 03:20:10,220
dynamic to be extra scrupulous and responsible. But that doesn't mean that the relationship in and

2337
03:20:10,220 --> 03:20:13,820
of itself is unethical because there's a power differential. And I really fucking hate that this

2338
03:20:13,820 --> 03:20:18,460
has been like this weird construction. It's so fucking weird. The only relationships that are

2339
03:20:18,460 --> 03:20:23,180
objectively obviously unethical, or when there are codified practices that make it clear that sexual

2340
03:20:23,180 --> 03:20:27,660
interactions cannot happen here, because at that point you're being unethical because you're

2341
03:20:27,660 --> 03:20:35,660
breaching a codified ethic that everyone has agreed to. I can kind of explain this,

2342
03:20:36,460 --> 03:20:39,980
but it might take a long time. And it might be too much of a derail.

2343
03:20:41,500 --> 03:20:46,700
Because, yeah, maybe I can just TLDR it without like going into super detail. Um,

2344
03:20:47,660 --> 03:20:54,620
there's a component of political theory on the left, that basically does define risk,

2345
03:20:55,260 --> 03:21:03,740
and does define differences in in comparative power. And it even defines the very concept of

2346
03:21:03,740 --> 03:21:10,060
negotiation as being unethical. And there's a whole wing of political theory on this and

2347
03:21:10,060 --> 03:21:16,780
they describe why and they describe how. And it's extremely toxic, because who the fuck actually

2348
03:21:16,780 --> 03:21:21,740
thinks like this in real life. But there's a political component to this. And then that

2349
03:21:21,740 --> 03:21:27,580
political component, if you believe in this sort of politics, it does filter down into other things

2350
03:21:27,580 --> 03:21:35,020
like sexual consent, for example. Yeah, I it would take it would it would be like,

2351
03:21:35,900 --> 03:21:40,140
it's already getting late. And it's kind of a derailment. Maybe it's maybe it's a conversation

2352
03:21:40,140 --> 03:21:43,500
we could talk about. Yeah, there is, we should throw it in our chat and then pin it.

2353
03:21:44,860 --> 03:21:47,900
Because every time we're like, let's chat, we're like, what are we talking about?

2354
03:21:49,260 --> 03:21:54,860
But because there is like a political science component of this, this conversation where it's

2355
03:21:54,860 --> 03:22:01,180
like, there's some political writers that have delegitimized the very notion of compromise.

2356
03:22:01,740 --> 03:22:06,700
And and every interaction with any other person, unless you're complete pure equals and always

2357
03:22:06,700 --> 03:22:09,420
is non consensual. It's a crazy line of politics.

2358
03:22:09,420 --> 03:22:15,340
Same, it's insane. And it's actually so bad for it. Like it's brain rot. It's actual brain rot.

2359
03:22:15,340 --> 03:22:17,980
But yeah, okay, let's, I'll write that in our chat.

2360
03:22:18,860 --> 03:22:20,380
Yeah, I'll put it in a text file or something.

2361
03:22:24,860 --> 03:22:30,220
Do you regret giving Mr. Girl a career? I don't know. I'm actually really surprised at this. I'm

2362
03:22:30,220 --> 03:22:33,500
not gonna lie. I feel like Max is so much to lose by like, I don't think I'll pull the plug on site

2363
03:22:33,500 --> 03:22:35,580
because I'm just not that kind of person. Although I think if I did, I don't think anybody would

2364
03:22:35,580 --> 03:22:38,700
think that I was in the wrong to do so. Like, I can see his income. I see like everything he does

2365
03:22:38,700 --> 03:22:41,180
on the back end of his site that is like running my shit. Like I could have just pulled the plug

2366
03:22:41,180 --> 03:22:44,140
on that. I don't know why. I don't know why he would think it like, but then I guess even just

2367
03:22:44,140 --> 03:22:46,700
saying that does that make me sound abusive? Like I have no idea. I don't know what the expectations

2368
03:22:46,700 --> 03:22:51,340
are. Something that I was gonna go off on. Something that I was gonna go off on related

2369
03:22:51,340 --> 03:22:55,500
to the conservative shit is that I'm really, really, really tired. And this has like been

2370
03:22:55,500 --> 03:22:59,340
wearing me down a lot over the past few months. The reason why I have good conversations with

2371
03:22:59,340 --> 03:23:03,260
people is because I have to try exceedingly hard to meet them where they're at, which is oftentimes

2372
03:23:03,260 --> 03:23:08,700
years behind me in terms of emotional maturity. And it is a struggle day in and day out to baby

2373
03:23:08,700 --> 03:23:12,380
walk people like lab or Mr. Girl through conversations to show them like, this is like,

2374
03:23:12,380 --> 03:23:15,020
this is why everybody hates you. This is why you're contradicting yourself this way around here.

2375
03:23:15,020 --> 03:23:18,780
And to be doing that at the same time that they're like constantly attacking me and shitting on me

2376
03:23:18,780 --> 03:23:22,460
when I'm applying like every fucking ounce of good faith and credibility I possibly can to

2377
03:23:22,460 --> 03:23:25,740
these people. And then they're like turning around and like calling me an abuser or saying that I'm

2378
03:23:25,740 --> 03:23:32,300
this or that is very fucking frustrating to me. I'll probably go back to my bunker in a day or two

2379
03:23:32,300 --> 03:23:35,500
and I'll probably try to like reconsider the amount of chairability that I extend to people

2380
03:23:35,500 --> 03:23:42,540
because it's just, that's a huge burden. Are you afraid that he would leak your secret? I mean,

2381
03:23:42,540 --> 03:23:45,020
like he might, the thing that sucks is that like technically none of these leaks really hurt me.

2382
03:23:45,020 --> 03:23:47,180
They just hurt other people who want to keep their business secret, which I'll always respect if

2383
03:23:47,180 --> 03:23:50,380
other people want to keep their business secret. I like, I'm always cool with that. But I mean,

2384
03:23:50,380 --> 03:23:53,580
I guess at this point it's up to those two who seem like they have no boundaries for any of that

2385
03:23:53,580 --> 03:24:01,420
now. But yeah, the the Mr. Girl, Shaylin laughs stuff is incredibly fucking creepy. I'm assuming

2386
03:24:01,420 --> 03:24:04,380
that Shaylin is a victim of max instead of assuming that she has any agency at all.

2387
03:24:04,380 --> 03:24:07,900
That's just the assumption I have because she's so caught in his orbit. But the max conversation

2388
03:24:07,900 --> 03:24:11,900
with laugh was actually unbelievable. You've been sexting consistently with Anna for a year.

2389
03:24:11,900 --> 03:24:14,540
Me and Anna don't have any problems. We're fine. You haven't, you haven't

2390
03:24:14,540 --> 03:24:18,940
been sexting consistently with Anna for a year. Oh my God. He jumps in. Sorry.

2391
03:24:20,700 --> 03:24:22,220
I know. I thought he jumped into our call.

2392
03:24:24,220 --> 03:24:30,700
You're like, where is he? That's true. Oh my God. Jesus Christ.

2393
03:24:30,700 --> 03:24:33,340
I was about to make a joke and say, I have been sexy with Annaver,

2394
03:24:33,340 --> 03:24:36,380
but somebody is going to clip that and take it out of context. I have not been sexy with Anna.

2395
03:24:36,380 --> 03:24:39,980
So it's clear. Okay. Everything you say. Oh gosh.

2396
03:24:40,780 --> 03:24:46,140
He's so loud too. Holy shit. He's so fucking loud. Is it okay on your ears? It's blasting mine.

2397
03:24:46,140 --> 03:24:51,020
Yeah. Is he doing like the, the infra Haas thing where he's like cranking his mic up to make sure

2398
03:24:51,020 --> 03:24:55,740
he can be heard? I'm not, so I'm not sure. I don't know. Destiny always asks people to

2399
03:24:55,740 --> 03:25:00,220
turn their mics down like 15%. So I think it's in part like destiny stuff has probably turned

2400
03:25:00,220 --> 03:25:07,260
off a little bit. Okay. But her is a lot. What have I said about her? That's a lie. Tell me

2401
03:25:07,260 --> 03:25:10,140
that she stopped you. She did stop me that she locked. Okay. Then why are you sexting

2402
03:25:10,140 --> 03:25:13,340
with her still? We're cool. We've been cool for a year, Max. Okay. So you acknowledge

2403
03:25:13,340 --> 03:25:15,420
that you've been texting with her for a year. I think, yeah, we've had on and off. Sure.

2404
03:25:15,980 --> 03:25:21,820
Consistently this entire time, every single day. No. What is this him admitting that he's doing

2405
03:25:21,820 --> 03:25:28,460
sex stuff again with Anna? Yes. What I know about the Anna story kind of sounded like

2406
03:25:29,500 --> 03:25:32,380
she was never going to do that again because she kind of went a bit unhinged.

2407
03:25:33,100 --> 03:25:40,140
Sounds like they work their stuff out. All right. The reality is like, I don't know.

2408
03:25:40,140 --> 03:25:45,820
It's I Yeah, I want to I'm not going to comment on it at all because I don't know what's public.

2409
03:25:47,180 --> 03:25:52,540
From what I from from a complete outsider's point of view, it sounded like this was somebody that

2410
03:25:52,540 --> 03:25:56,380
it would be wise to never do anything with again. But you know, you can, I guess he does.

2411
03:25:59,340 --> 03:26:01,180
But Max, listen to me. Do you understand that we've been fine for a year?

2412
03:26:01,900 --> 03:26:05,020
When you say we've been fine. That includes that you've been sexting for a year. Sure. Yes.

2413
03:26:05,580 --> 03:26:09,980
Okay. So when you're saying that she is locking you in the basement of her mind or that she's a

2414
03:26:09,980 --> 03:26:12,860
traumatic stalker person who's your victim, you have all these people. Can you can you

2415
03:26:12,860 --> 03:26:15,180
acknowledge that? I haven't said anything bad about her for a year. I said we've been fine.

2416
03:26:15,180 --> 03:26:18,540
I said the last time I talked to you about her like two weeks ago or 16 days ago or something,

2417
03:26:18,540 --> 03:26:21,420
you said that she locked you in the basement of her mind. It was a traumatic experience for you.

2418
03:26:21,420 --> 03:26:24,220
Yeah. Because a year or two ago, she spent two years nonstop talking about me no matter what I

2419
03:26:24,220 --> 03:26:28,620
did. You understand that that was a year ago. If you pull up clips on my stream ever since I moved

2420
03:26:28,620 --> 03:26:31,420
to Miami, I've always said me and Anna are cool. It's chill. Like she used to be, I would say,

2421
03:26:31,420 --> 03:26:33,580
a stalker or she used to be like, whatever, but we're cool. We've been fine for like a year,

2422
03:26:33,580 --> 03:26:37,820
literally. Okay. So this, the fact that you've been sexting with her is already absorbed into

2423
03:26:37,820 --> 03:26:41,660
your narrative about this. Do you think that changes anything? Yes, absolutely. I think it.

2424
03:26:41,660 --> 03:26:44,460
Okay. Have I talked shit about her this past year? Yes. The last time I talked to you,

2425
03:26:44,460 --> 03:26:47,340
you said that she locked you in the basement of her mind. Locked me in the past. In the past,

2426
03:26:47,340 --> 03:26:51,420
Max. Oh, okay. Why, tell me, Max, why hasn't Anna come forward with any of this information now?

2427
03:26:51,420 --> 03:26:55,180
Can you tell me or do you want me to tell everybody why? I don't want to speak on her

2428
03:26:55,180 --> 03:26:57,260
behalf. Okay. I will. It's because she said she literally wants to remain friends with me. And

2429
03:26:57,260 --> 03:26:58,860
she said that, and I've had that conversation multiple times. Are you sure you want to be

2430
03:26:58,860 --> 03:27:00,780
friends? Are you sure about this? And she's like, yeah, this is fine. It's cool. She talks to me.

2431
03:27:00,780 --> 03:27:02,780
We talk about her shit. Sometimes she loops on stream. Sometimes she talks about her fucking

2432
03:27:02,780 --> 03:27:04,860
loops. Like, yeah, that's fine. But that's why she won't go public. It's because she's literally

2433
03:27:04,860 --> 03:27:06,940
told you. And I know she's told you this. And she told me this. Like, yeah, I still want to be

2434
03:27:06,940 --> 03:27:08,460
friends with you. I was like, okay, fine, whatever. I don't really care that much. It's fine. That's

2435
03:27:08,460 --> 03:27:10,700
cool. You've got a problem. She loops. Sometimes she talks to me about it and then that's it.

2436
03:27:10,700 --> 03:27:12,620
Okay. You've built your entire narrative on this one story. And again, to repeat,

2437
03:27:12,620 --> 03:27:16,380
I'm gonna ask you, this entire narrative that I'm like abusing women sexually, but I'm gonna

2438
03:27:16,380 --> 03:27:19,100
ask you again. Have I said anything bad about her over the past year? I said in the past,

2439
03:27:19,100 --> 03:27:23,340
things were bad, but I have seen, I have seen the logs, dude. I have seen her asking you,

2440
03:27:23,340 --> 03:27:25,980
Hey, why are you calling me a stalker on stream? What's going on? Why is that happening? Yeah.

2441
03:27:25,980 --> 03:27:28,460
When she gets into her loops, but I don't call her a stalker. I said she used to. And then

2442
03:27:28,460 --> 03:27:32,140
within two more, two more lines, you're saying you're sending her videos. It depends. Our

2443
03:27:32,140 --> 03:27:35,340
conversations move back and forth. Sure. Okay. So have you seen the conversation?

2444
03:27:36,460 --> 03:27:38,220
Like, Hey, do you want to be friends? You don't want to be friends. You want to do this,

2445
03:27:38,220 --> 03:27:41,260
but like, yeah, we've had plenty of conversations and you can go and ask her where, Hey, have you

2446
03:27:41,260 --> 03:27:43,180
hold on? No, no, hold on. Cause you're, I know the narrative you're trying to sell where she's

2447
03:27:43,180 --> 03:27:47,420
explicitly saying I'm keeping her on like some weird, like sexually abusive stream. When I've

2448
03:27:47,420 --> 03:27:49,020
asked her plenty of times, like, do you still want to talk to you? I want to do whatever.

2449
03:27:49,020 --> 03:27:51,100
And she's like, okay, well, as long as you want to, sure. That's fine. But I haven't

2450
03:27:51,100 --> 03:27:53,980
shit talked to her on stream. Sometimes she loops on her stream about me. I don't respond to it on

2451
03:27:53,980 --> 03:27:56,220
my stream. And I say, everything's cool. Like we're pretty chill. And then boom. That's it.

2452
03:27:57,180 --> 03:28:00,860
Well, the narrative I have is that while she is getting publicly dog piled by your community

2453
03:28:00,860 --> 03:28:05,500
and is labeled as a stalker, she's labeled as a crazy person in a stalker that no one is allowed

2454
03:28:05,500 --> 03:28:08,060
to talk about. And it'll have even mentioning her to you made you threatened to cut laugh off

2455
03:28:08,060 --> 03:28:11,980
permanently. Why is she considered a crazy person in my community? That's not, I'm not answering

2456
03:28:11,980 --> 03:28:14,220
that question. That's not talking about it's important because you're blaming it implicitly

2457
03:28:14,220 --> 03:28:18,140
on me. Me and Anna have talked about this before. It doesn't matter. It matters where the facts

2458
03:28:18,140 --> 03:28:22,140
come from. It's a fact that Anna is labeled as a stalker in your community. Okay, hold on. I'm

2459
03:28:22,140 --> 03:28:25,900
meeting you for a second. Okay. So what's happened is, is when Anna goes live on her stream and then

2460
03:28:25,900 --> 03:28:30,140
she starts looping that gets attention on places like Kiwi farms. Oh, he left. Okay. Easy. Boom.

2461
03:28:30,140 --> 03:28:35,660
So is the, is, is, is it possible that the difference between them is that Max feels

2462
03:28:35,660 --> 03:28:39,580
like destiny is far more responsible for the actions of his community than destiny feels like

2463
03:28:39,580 --> 03:28:46,700
he is? Yes, he basically thinks that destiny needs to, so here's the issue. I don't know what

2464
03:28:46,700 --> 03:28:52,540
specifically he wants destiny to do other than basically never levy criticisms at any of his

2465
03:28:52,540 --> 03:28:59,660
friends. Uh, because when in fairness, when destiny criticizes somebody, a lot of people

2466
03:28:59,660 --> 03:29:06,220
in DGG very much respect him. So if there is an element where destiny can frame the structure of

2467
03:29:06,220 --> 03:29:12,220
the narrative, right? So if he says erudite is a stupid bitch who fakes her credentials,

2468
03:29:12,220 --> 03:29:18,220
the reality is that I would need a huge burden of proof to really try to undo the structure

2469
03:29:18,220 --> 03:29:22,140
of that narrative because people respect his opinion. They know that he checks his sources,

2470
03:29:22,140 --> 03:29:26,140
which means this is why like destiny is valuable in this space is when he says something is some

2471
03:29:26,140 --> 03:29:30,060
way people tend to give it a lot of gravity because he's not somebody who says something

2472
03:29:30,060 --> 03:29:33,660
is just some way and he doesn't have fucking receipts for what he's talking about, right?

2473
03:29:33,660 --> 03:29:37,820
And so this is why there's this tricky thing of when he labels somebody with a criticism,

2474
03:29:37,820 --> 03:29:42,780
it fucking punches home because there's a lot of weight there. The problem is that that's not

2475
03:29:42,780 --> 03:29:48,060
necessarily an expression of his toxic community attacking people. It's the respect that he's

2476
03:29:48,060 --> 03:29:52,940
gained from his community that when he's willing to levy a criticism, his community goes, okay,

2477
03:29:52,940 --> 03:29:57,260
that's gotta be fucking right then. That's the issue. That's what's really going on that I don't

2478
03:29:57,260 --> 03:30:01,900
think they've like sussed out the like nuance within there of like what's going on. And the

2479
03:30:01,900 --> 03:30:09,260
issue is that what if he's right most of the time, right? It doesn't feel nice to have certain

2480
03:30:09,260 --> 03:30:13,980
criticisms levied against you, but I've never heard him make a criticism against Max or Lav

2481
03:30:13,980 --> 03:30:21,100
that wasn't very legitimate. So. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm on board with what you're saying. Yeah.

2482
03:30:22,220 --> 03:30:27,660
Failing me on the steel man, man. I mean, it's, it's kind of hard at this point.

2483
03:30:27,660 --> 03:30:29,580
You're like, I can't steal mountains out of you. Okay.

2484
03:30:30,380 --> 03:30:34,380
Like the, the, the best steel man that I could think of is that maybe,

2485
03:30:34,380 --> 03:30:38,860
maybe max thinks that destiny is way more responsible for the actions of his community

2486
03:30:38,860 --> 03:30:42,620
than he does. And so max is coming in and saying, you need to stop your community from doing

2487
03:30:42,620 --> 03:30:46,460
this. But even then, like, I don't even agree with that point of view. So

2488
03:30:49,020 --> 03:30:53,500
it's, it's hard. It's hard. It's hard this time. Yeah.

2489
03:30:55,260 --> 03:30:59,820
And every time I saw a false narrative, there was like a point in time where it was almost

2490
03:30:59,820 --> 03:31:02,700
the case that like Anna publicly had like redeemed herself. Like we were on like a panel,

2491
03:31:02,700 --> 03:31:05,740
everything was chill. Everything was cool. And then she like, and then she keeps,

2492
03:31:05,740 --> 03:31:06,780
and then she just keeps looping. But

2493
03:31:06,780 --> 03:31:13,260
he just wanted to drop that bomb and leave. True. I wonder if he's gonna have any luck getting of

2494
03:31:13,260 --> 03:31:17,020
the, any of the other fucking 20 girls that he's trying to contact to flip against me. Jesus.

2495
03:31:19,820 --> 03:31:21,900
He literally does not know that everyone saw the entire history of Anna. Yeah.

2496
03:31:21,900 --> 03:31:23,500
The problem is that he thinks that she is a,

2497
03:31:23,500 --> 03:31:26,780
that she has a bad reputation in my community because of me, but that's not the case.

2498
03:31:26,780 --> 03:31:28,860
Like I literally banned all mentions of like talking to her loops,

2499
03:31:28,860 --> 03:31:31,420
reacting to her loops or anything like that. Yeah. For the most part,

2500
03:31:31,420 --> 03:31:33,100
like we didn't talk about her except for whenever she would go like on her,

2501
03:31:33,180 --> 03:31:34,060
like crazy loops or whatever.

2502
03:31:40,460 --> 03:31:41,580
I'm trying to think if I should read any of the.

2503
03:31:44,700 --> 03:31:47,180
This was some of the messages that he was sending to other people. If Anna gives me permission,

2504
03:31:47,180 --> 03:31:49,260
I can prove that almost everything Destiny said about her is a lie.

2505
03:31:52,060 --> 03:31:55,260
He's mentioned to people, I have to move fast because Steven is in full attack mode on me.

2506
03:31:55,260 --> 03:31:58,700
When I haven't attacked him at all on stream ever, I think he's just mad because I'm reacting

2507
03:31:58,700 --> 03:32:02,540
to his videos where he's talking to lab about me. Oh, this is where he paints out the,

2508
03:32:02,540 --> 03:32:06,940
this is the, uh, this is the destiny pattern. One bring on female orbiter, two fucker,

2509
03:32:06,940 --> 03:32:09,900
three trash her with the community and four discard her. I would like to stop this from

2510
03:32:09,900 --> 03:32:12,540
happening, but I don't think I can do it unless Anna is willing to come forward.

2511
03:32:12,540 --> 03:32:16,780
Oh, this is the shit Max does is what he said. He feels some sort of way. He's mad because

2512
03:32:16,780 --> 03:32:20,540
Destiny's not defending him. He got banned from his Reddit and he feels like because

2513
03:32:20,540 --> 03:32:23,980
destiny won't defend him, that he can't be on destiny stream anymore. And that hurts him

2514
03:32:23,980 --> 03:32:28,300
because he's like, this is my friend. And I feel very hurt. And now he's creating this

2515
03:32:28,300 --> 03:32:33,820
massive narrative. See what happened to me is happening to all the other girl. I'm just

2516
03:32:33,820 --> 03:32:37,820
like every other girl here. You know, I have a good relationship with him. You know,

2517
03:32:37,820 --> 03:32:42,060
we get really intimate and close and then I disagree with him once. And then he did six,

2518
03:32:42,060 --> 03:32:45,500
his attack dogs on me. And then he kicks me out of the community. And it's just like,

2519
03:32:45,500 --> 03:32:49,580
none of this shit fucking happened. There's all your feelings. And now you're turning your

2520
03:32:49,580 --> 03:32:56,700
feelings into a fucking moral crusade. Gross. It seems it, yeah, it seems, Hmm.

2521
03:32:58,940 --> 03:33:05,900
Hmm. I'm trying to kind of process this in my head a little bit because

2522
03:33:07,660 --> 03:33:11,900
it's going to sound very strange and probably very wrong, but I think I'm correct.

2523
03:33:13,180 --> 03:33:19,580
Like everyone does this to an extent. You know, it's if the ultimate black pill,

2524
03:33:19,580 --> 03:33:27,340
the purest form black pill is that all evidence is ultimately just an argument from authority

2525
03:33:27,660 --> 03:33:30,700
because you weren't there and you don't know. You're hoping that the university that you get

2526
03:33:30,700 --> 03:33:36,220
your study from is legit. You're hoping that the report of this video wasn't completely faked.

2527
03:33:36,220 --> 03:33:39,900
You're hoping like everything is an argument from authority. Do you trust the source that

2528
03:33:39,900 --> 03:33:43,180
has sent this to you? Unless you've experienced it, it's an argument from authority. That's the

2529
03:33:43,180 --> 03:33:49,980
ultimate black pill, the ultimate skeptical position. And Max is doing like an emotional

2530
03:33:49,980 --> 03:33:57,260
version of this, if that makes sense to you, where. Because he feels a way that's the reality

2531
03:33:58,060 --> 03:34:01,820
and there's no and there's no room for for anything else.

2532
03:34:04,140 --> 03:34:09,980
Yeah. Yeah, there's no it's yeah, it's just him in his position, right? It's like that moral,

2533
03:34:09,980 --> 03:34:14,060
yeah, that moral and intellectual righteousness. I mean, I was like looking at like his fucking,

2534
03:34:14,060 --> 03:34:18,700
I don't know if you ever saw his tweet that he made when he was declaring war, but he like,

2535
03:34:19,260 --> 03:34:23,260
it's like, I don't I don't know what the fuck has happened, but he like basically is like,

2536
03:34:23,260 --> 03:34:28,300
if people watch my work and they don't get me, it's because they're intellectually inferior

2537
03:34:28,300 --> 03:34:33,980
or they're too afraid to dive into this stuff. And my fans, they're like my little knights.

2538
03:34:33,980 --> 03:34:37,580
They're my little knights who get me and they and they creep into all the other discords and

2539
03:34:37,580 --> 03:34:42,220
Reddits and they explain me because they see me. And now my knights are getting banned and killed

2540
03:34:42,220 --> 03:34:45,900
left and right. And so there's no one left to defend my name. And it's like, why do you need

2541
03:34:45,900 --> 03:34:51,820
to be defended? Like, why are you entitled to this? You literally said parasociality is bad

2542
03:34:51,820 --> 03:34:55,660
and you're calling your fucking fans, your little knights who get you and protect you.

2543
03:34:55,660 --> 03:35:00,460
Like, what the fuck? I don't even understand. I don't even disagree with his I even disagree

2544
03:35:00,460 --> 03:35:05,260
with his like view of parasociality. But like, holy fuck, for somebody who's so anti parasociality,

2545
03:35:05,260 --> 03:35:07,900
what the fuck are you doing? Mobilizing your units like what?

2546
03:35:09,900 --> 03:35:15,820
Raising. I was only like 75% saying what I was trying to say. I think I have the rest of it.

2547
03:35:16,380 --> 03:35:21,420
Like, oh, fuck, what was the name of the guy? I can't remember the name of the guy.

2548
03:35:21,420 --> 03:35:26,220
It was a philosophy paper 2009 Sargon and Taftage have both talked about it before and sent it to

2549
03:35:26,220 --> 03:35:33,660
me. I forget the name. I know the idea. The idea is that all of morality based is just simply what

2550
03:35:33,660 --> 03:35:39,740
feels good. Not not feels like pleasurable. I mean, like, feels what is the good, you know,

2551
03:35:39,740 --> 03:35:45,340
like, if you're taking a moral position, if you boil it down, it's just going to be your moral

2552
03:35:45,340 --> 03:35:49,580
intuitions. And that's it. It's not Jonathan Haidt, but it it's kind of it's kind of similar

2553
03:35:49,580 --> 03:35:55,580
to his ideas. And so like, you get like, you get, let's say, more on the left than the right,

2554
03:35:55,580 --> 03:35:59,020
you get people who say it's who say that they're consequentialists. Sorry, cons,

2555
03:35:59,020 --> 03:36:05,100
consequence, Jesus Christ, consequentialists, where they're only interested in consequences

2556
03:36:05,100 --> 03:36:09,980
and not and not rules. No, does this create good ends? That's my moral system. And it's like,

2557
03:36:09,980 --> 03:36:14,700
well, no, it's not because how do you judge what makes a good and good? And that's just going to

2558
03:36:14,700 --> 03:36:22,860
boil down to how you feel. Right. So you might have a consequentialist, socialist atheist living

2559
03:36:22,860 --> 03:36:27,420
in the West, who says we shouldn't get we should not kill gay people because killing gay people is

2560
03:36:27,420 --> 03:36:33,260
bad and wrong. And that's a bad end. And then you might have a consequentialist, you know, ISIS,

2561
03:36:33,260 --> 03:36:37,500
radical Muslim living in the Middle East, who's throwing gays off rooftops. And you ask him,

2562
03:36:37,500 --> 03:36:42,300
Well, what are you doing? He says, this is a good end. Because in terms of my moral framework,

2563
03:36:42,700 --> 03:36:50,380
more dead gay people is moral for me. So even even the the way of calculating morality already

2564
03:36:50,380 --> 03:37:00,300
presupposes a huge amount of normativity. And, and so you get to a point where if all of morality

2565
03:37:00,300 --> 03:37:08,860
really just is how you intuitively feel. And you just fully embrace and accept that there's no way

2566
03:37:09,580 --> 03:37:15,820
to like, argue a person like this out of their position. Because it's, they're gonna be like,

2567
03:37:15,820 --> 03:37:19,180
I don't feel that. You say, you say, Well, hold on, this is this is bad. He goes, I don't feel

2568
03:37:19,180 --> 03:37:27,660
that. You're wrong with this. Well, I don't feel that. You know? Yeah. And it seems like maybe

2569
03:37:27,660 --> 03:37:34,300
maybe Max has taken some very strong black pills on the moral question. Yeah, I can't I can't

2570
03:37:34,380 --> 03:37:41,100
decide is like moral framework, because it it feels like because I agree that most people do

2571
03:37:41,100 --> 03:37:45,580
kind of what you're saying. I think there are rare exceptional people who really do try to

2572
03:37:45,580 --> 03:37:50,060
think about moral frameworks, and they do their best to hold themselves to it despite how they

2573
03:37:50,060 --> 03:37:54,620
feel in that moment. Right. And I find those people incredibly respect worthy because they're

2574
03:37:54,620 --> 03:37:59,740
decently rare. And it's hard to do yourself right. Like deplatforming is bad until all of a sudden

2575
03:37:59,740 --> 03:38:03,020
you fucking hate that fucking piece of shit and you want them deplatformed, right?

2576
03:38:03,900 --> 03:38:07,100
Doxing is bad until fuck you just want to dox them to fucking get back at them.

2577
03:38:09,980 --> 03:38:14,540
And I think this is the issue is like, I don't know if Max has a moral code, but he claimed to

2578
03:38:14,540 --> 03:38:19,420
have really important ethical principles that he lived by. And the problem is that I feel like he's

2579
03:38:19,420 --> 03:38:24,700
just lied or given up on them. Or he's like post hoc trying to like rationalize that he's still

2580
03:38:24,700 --> 03:38:31,020
operating from within them. I'm not really sure. Well, I think he still does. But I think what

2581
03:38:31,020 --> 03:38:39,900
those what those that moral code is, is basically just what he intuits as right without any sort of

2582
03:38:39,900 --> 03:38:46,700
like actual rational processing behind it. Yeah. It's like, oh, my gut says this is bad. So it's

2583
03:38:46,700 --> 03:38:52,380
bad. And to him, it's objectively bad, because his gut tells himself. And to be fair, that's

2584
03:38:52,380 --> 03:38:58,620
how a lot of people do this sort of thing. I mean, that's how I do this sort of thing. And

2585
03:38:58,620 --> 03:39:03,740
I think it's I think it's normal. Yeah, it's not good. I do try to think I'm a free speech

2586
03:39:03,740 --> 03:39:09,340
extremist. I think free speech is good, even speech that I don't like. Because I try to hold

2587
03:39:09,340 --> 03:39:14,620
myself to some sort of more objective standard. But even then, like that presupposes a normativity

2588
03:39:14,620 --> 03:39:19,260
where you care about objective standards, you know? Right. Right. Which a lot of a lot of people

2589
03:39:19,900 --> 03:39:24,060
say that they do, but they don't. Yeah. Yeah. And maybe Max is just more honest about it. Maybe he

2590
03:39:24,060 --> 03:39:28,300
just like, yeah, I don't care. I you know, my morality is that I want things to be partial to

2591
03:39:28,300 --> 03:39:32,780
me. Maybe that's his moral code. Right. Most people don't value. It's not even like objective

2592
03:39:32,780 --> 03:39:37,020
morality. It's like consistent morality. Most people seem to like not value consistent moral

2593
03:39:37,020 --> 03:39:43,420
reality very much like, OK, for me and not for these kind of a go to. Yeah.

2594
03:39:43,420 --> 03:39:49,580
If you need to go at any time, I know you said an hour and I worry that that was an hour ago. So

2595
03:39:49,580 --> 03:39:55,100
if you need to go at any time. That was half an hour ago. And with my the magic of wireless

2596
03:39:55,100 --> 03:39:58,780
headphones, I slipped out and talked to Naomi and she gave me a very stern look.

2597
03:39:59,340 --> 03:40:03,180
And she was like, I understand. Here, just just hold on a second. OK, OK.

2598
03:40:06,860 --> 03:40:07,420
Naomi.

2599
03:40:07,420 --> 03:40:15,820
Erudite wants to know how much longer I can go. Give me a time.

2600
03:40:20,780 --> 03:40:25,180
Did you hear that? No, I did not hear that she she gave me an hour.

2601
03:40:26,620 --> 03:40:33,660
OK, so we're good. Hey, thank you very much. I love you. She's very unimpressed right now.

2602
03:40:34,220 --> 03:40:39,740
Should we should we be very good? And we'll only I'm going to force you to get off in half an hour

2603
03:40:39,740 --> 03:40:44,460
so that she's pleasantly surprised by your earliness. Maybe, maybe. I know that there's at

2604
03:40:44,460 --> 03:40:48,060
least some of my viewers in the chat and they all they all know about Naomi and what she's like.

2605
03:40:48,060 --> 03:40:52,060
She's been on my channel a whole bunch. They know the dynamic. OK.

2606
03:40:52,380 --> 03:41:04,460
OK.

2607
03:41:04,460 --> 03:41:07,580
Oh, it was this message. He's starting the anti Mr. Girl hate train. Pretty hardcore now.

2608
03:41:07,580 --> 03:41:10,860
To be clear, I never even really said anything about him except for reacting to the videos he

2609
03:41:10,860 --> 03:41:14,780
was doing with them. This is exactly what Laff said. Yeah, because because Max's sold this

2610
03:41:14,780 --> 03:41:18,540
message to Laff and to Anna and I don't and probably to Shaylin, too. So like all of them

2611
03:41:18,540 --> 03:41:22,300
are on 100 percent the same page when it comes to, I guess, me being this like crazy manipulative

2612
03:41:22,300 --> 03:41:29,420
abuser or whatever. This is he keeps messaging all these people, he's like, I'm trying to,

2613
03:41:29,420 --> 03:41:32,380
but none of these girls are getting back to me because nobody's responding to insane fucking

2614
03:41:32,380 --> 03:41:34,620
shit. A lot of these people like are coming to be a message like, hey, this guy's like

2615
03:41:34,620 --> 03:41:36,940
messaging me asking me weird stuff. He seems to have this idea that I'm like.

2616
03:41:37,900 --> 03:41:41,900
Yes. So that should be if you're somebody who actually believes this narrative. No,

2617
03:41:41,900 --> 03:41:44,300
I think that for Mr. Girl in his mind, I think he actually believes all.

2618
03:41:44,300 --> 03:41:48,700
Wait a second. OK, sorry. Sorry. If you are somebody who wasn't just privileging the

2619
03:41:48,700 --> 03:41:54,860
hypothesis and you really were trying to figure out the the truth objective from your own

2620
03:41:54,860 --> 03:42:00,220
perceptions, if, you know, a dozen of the girls say, what are you talking about?

2621
03:42:00,220 --> 03:42:02,540
That should be the moment where you stop and think about it.

2622
03:42:06,860 --> 03:42:12,700
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the fact that he didn't probably shows what's going on.

2623
03:42:12,700 --> 03:42:18,140
Yeah. Man, I wish I could show you my DMs. My DMs are blowing up. I'm getting so distracted

2624
03:42:18,140 --> 03:42:20,940
because people like sending me this and this and they're like, here's this clip. Here's

2625
03:42:20,940 --> 03:42:24,540
the verbatim thing that you need to be aware of. And I'm like, I don't know how to play 90 chess.

2626
03:42:26,060 --> 03:42:30,460
Can you can you say who's DMing you or is it not a shot?

2627
03:42:30,460 --> 03:42:34,700
No shot. I don't want to pull anyone in that doesn't want to be pulled in. Everyone can

2628
03:42:35,260 --> 03:42:40,460
make public declarations on their own at their own time. Fair enough. I'm just explaining to you

2629
03:42:40,460 --> 03:42:43,820
because everyone probably notices me getting like distracted and me being a bad interlocutor.

2630
03:42:43,820 --> 03:42:49,260
And I do genuinely apologize. But there's like a couple of people needing my help with a couple

2631
03:42:49,260 --> 03:42:55,580
of things. So, yeah, I haven't I haven't noticed anything. It's all right. Could you say if it's

2632
03:42:55,580 --> 03:42:59,580
are these like streamers or personalities or are these just random people? Can you say that or no?

2633
03:42:59,580 --> 03:43:04,380
I'm not even going to say that. It's a whole it's a whole I'll say it's a mixture of all the above.

2634
03:43:04,380 --> 03:43:07,260
Understood. Yeah. Genuinely is a mixture of all the above.

2635
03:43:07,980 --> 03:43:10,860
So I'm extremely curious if you want to type them to me, I won't reveal.

2636
03:43:11,820 --> 03:43:15,260
You don't have to. You don't have to know. I'm open to accepting the information.

2637
03:43:16,220 --> 03:43:22,460
You're like, I'm nosy, but I won't be pushy. Yes. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I appreciate that.

2638
03:43:22,460 --> 03:43:27,340
But I'm going to say no. Sorry. As a fellow, nosy person. I understand, though.

2639
03:43:30,620 --> 03:43:33,420
I think that he really does believe because in the mind of a narcissist, you're never wrong.

2640
03:43:33,420 --> 03:43:36,220
He thinks that he's like the hero, like saving these people from the ashes or some shit.

2641
03:43:37,260 --> 03:43:48,540
Try to ask for an example of one thing they disagree on, and she paused for like a minute

2642
03:43:48,540 --> 03:43:50,860
before going on a tangent about gender identity that she said they probably agree on, but haven't

2643
03:43:50,860 --> 03:43:54,140
talked about. Oh, well, I've been obsessed with Max for months, I think so. She'll agree with

2644
03:43:54,140 --> 03:43:59,020
literally anything literally with anything Max says. So, you know, he's trying to do this to

2645
03:43:59,020 --> 03:44:01,660
come up with a podcast about you both. I don't think it has to do with the next podcast. I think

2646
03:44:01,660 --> 03:44:05,740
it has to do. I think the subreddit stuff like fucked his mind like really hard. Who's this?

2647
03:44:05,740 --> 03:44:09,340
Unless you're something super relevant. I'm sorry. I just wanted to see my first. I was

2648
03:44:09,340 --> 03:44:11,340
just watching some of the stream started. I don't mean to cut you off. I'll pop out. I know you're

2649
03:44:11,340 --> 03:44:13,900
going through some shit. Okay. Have fun, buddy. All right, bro. Stay strong, brother.

2650
03:44:21,580 --> 03:44:24,620
Lab on her stream said she thinks it's hypocritical for you to call Max a narcissist. That's because

2651
03:44:24,620 --> 03:44:27,180
she probably doesn't know what a narcissist is. I don't think that has very much people experience

2652
03:44:27,180 --> 03:44:30,860
in general, which is probably one of the reasons why she's so easy to manipulate, which is kind of

2653
03:44:30,860 --> 03:44:36,860
what Max is like. I don't really blame what kind of reason why love is obsessed with Mr. Girl.

2654
03:44:36,860 --> 03:44:46,620
So Mr. Girl, Mr. Girl is a person who has a lot of gravity. I think he's he's kind of similar,

2655
03:44:46,620 --> 03:44:51,500
actually, I think to Steven in this way. It seems like especially with women, like some guys just

2656
03:44:51,500 --> 03:45:00,300
have a lot of gravity for like whatever reason. You know, Max's no matter how big of a piece of

2657
03:45:00,300 --> 03:45:04,700
shit I think he's being, he's extremely smart. Like he's a very, very, very smart person.

2658
03:45:06,380 --> 03:45:09,820
He's kind of really unique in the fact that he's kind of like refreshing,

2659
03:45:09,820 --> 03:45:18,460
that he's so like emotionally blunt. And there's also so one thing that I really dislike when I

2660
03:45:18,460 --> 03:45:23,020
engage with Max that I can see other people finding it kind of attractive, maybe or enjoyable

2661
03:45:23,020 --> 03:45:28,380
or like intriguing is there's always this tension with him where you know that he's trying to mind

2662
03:45:28,380 --> 03:45:32,380
read you at all times and trying to read implications into all of your words. And so

2663
03:45:32,380 --> 03:45:37,340
you can't help but trying to do the same thing back to him. And I fucking hate that shit. I'm

2664
03:45:37,340 --> 03:45:43,180
not interested. But I definitely know some people who find that very interesting and like seem to

2665
03:45:43,180 --> 03:45:48,700
like to engage in that dynamic in relationships. That's like the best I can guess. I think she

2666
03:45:48,700 --> 03:45:56,220
feels very similar to him in that like, she's got a really traumatic childhood, like really high

2667
03:45:56,220 --> 03:46:01,900
trauma childhood. And he's also got a pretty high trauma childhood. So I think there's probably some

2668
03:46:01,900 --> 03:46:07,980
level of kinship over that as well. A lot of like she seems to be really into kind of the mind

2669
03:46:07,980 --> 03:46:12,700
reading type of engagement with people. And so I think she gets that a lot. I think like Max is

2670
03:46:12,700 --> 03:46:17,980
like probably the most extreme that I've met personally, like in like, not personally,

2671
03:46:17,980 --> 03:46:23,500
interpersonal interaction that does that. So if she enjoys that style of engagement, particularly

2672
03:46:23,500 --> 03:46:27,820
a lot, that's going to be like one of her most favorite people to go to words. That's really

2673
03:46:27,820 --> 03:46:34,140
different about like Max and destiny is like, destiny says exactly what he means. There's no

2674
03:46:34,140 --> 03:46:38,220
implications. There's nothing more than what he means. If he thinks you're because I think you're

2675
03:46:38,220 --> 03:46:42,780
doing bad here. He means you're literally doing a bad thing. And that is the full stop. He's not

2676
03:46:42,780 --> 03:46:46,860
necessarily he's not implying that you're a bad person doesn't go beyond that. Right. So that's

2677
03:46:46,860 --> 03:46:52,940
how Max and Destiny are very, very different. OK, yeah, I think I understand. It's just the.

2678
03:46:54,220 --> 03:47:00,540
You know. The I guess like every time you talk to Max, it's a struggle session, kind of.

2679
03:47:03,260 --> 03:47:07,900
Yeah, he's very mind fucky. He's very, very mind fucky. And I've seen very, very,

2680
03:47:07,900 --> 03:47:12,860
very few streamers in the space know how to manage it. And I guess some people just want to get mind

2681
03:47:12,860 --> 03:47:17,660
fucked. OK, I don't think you want to, but it's compelling because it's about like that. So here's

2682
03:47:17,660 --> 03:47:22,380
what's really compelling about Max is that he uniquely has here now conversations almost

2683
03:47:22,380 --> 03:47:27,340
always what people are calling the meta is fundamentally what in like existential therapy

2684
03:47:27,340 --> 03:47:31,740
we would call a here now conversation. And as somebody who's run treatment and therapy

2685
03:47:31,740 --> 03:47:38,860
that focuses on healthy, healthy, not manipulative here now conversations, they're so interesting

2686
03:47:38,860 --> 03:47:43,420
because they're deeply about you. And those are our favorite conversations. Right. So like,

2687
03:47:43,420 --> 03:47:47,660
that's why a lot of people, I think, really enjoy the Max because it's deeply here now.

2688
03:47:47,660 --> 03:47:53,420
And we rarely get to experience that. Right. Like I could conjure it up right now in part because

2689
03:47:53,420 --> 03:47:57,020
I'm trained, which is why I almost actually never engage in here now conversations on stream.

2690
03:47:57,020 --> 03:48:00,460
I just want to be really careful about it. Like I could conjure it now by being like,

2691
03:48:00,460 --> 03:48:03,420
how do you feel about me precisely like right now? Like how you felt about the fact that I

2692
03:48:03,420 --> 03:48:06,540
interrupted our politics conversation to like drag you into this drama? Like,

2693
03:48:06,540 --> 03:48:10,540
is that upsetting you in any way? That would be right. And that question you can tell it puts

2694
03:48:10,540 --> 03:48:14,860
pressure on you. Yeah. I'm not actually asking, but that would be an immediate here now question.

2695
03:48:14,860 --> 03:48:17,660
And then what he does is he decides whether you're, he thinks your answer is right. So

2696
03:48:17,660 --> 03:48:22,940
if you said no, he'd be like, I don't think that's true. I noticed a weird pause when I switched over

2697
03:48:22,940 --> 03:48:26,940
and I'm pretty sure that you actually are extremely angry, but you're too passive and

2698
03:48:26,940 --> 03:48:32,140
cowardly to be honest with me about the fact that you're upset that I moved on in the conversation.

2699
03:48:32,140 --> 03:48:36,140
Right. So that's the next thing that he's going to do here. Now conversations are fascinating

2700
03:48:36,140 --> 03:48:40,940
because we never do them in our culture. Yeah. I think what you're talking about, it's like,

2701
03:48:41,740 --> 03:48:45,340
you know, I think a lot of police might rely on them because everyone wants, it's the whole,

2702
03:48:45,340 --> 03:48:48,860
everyone wants to tell their story thing. So you can get, you can get a suspect talking,

2703
03:48:48,860 --> 03:48:52,220
you can talk them into a corner kind of thing. It's more than that because it's not just talking

2704
03:48:52,220 --> 03:48:57,580
about your life. It's talking about you, who you are right now in this moment. How do you feel

2705
03:48:57,580 --> 03:49:01,740
right now in this moment? What is the body expressions that you're having? What is your

2706
03:49:01,740 --> 03:49:07,580
heart feeling? What is your chest? Are your palms sweaty? Like it's very intimate and in your face

2707
03:49:07,580 --> 03:49:12,140
and people basically never have it. It's a very, it's a very weird style of engagement that

2708
03:49:12,140 --> 03:49:18,140
I've, I've never seen in any of the existential groups I've run. I've never seen a group not be

2709
03:49:18,140 --> 03:49:23,820
absorbed by here now conversations. Right. No, I think I understand you. Yeah.

2710
03:49:26,140 --> 03:49:29,900
Because Lab is one of the people that I was, Lab is one of the people that I was talking to

2711
03:49:29,900 --> 03:49:33,820
on a more personal level. But there's, I've always said something that like,

2712
03:49:33,820 --> 03:49:36,380
when I see people like turning against me, I never like fight for relationships because it's weird.

2713
03:49:36,380 --> 03:49:39,020
I don't want to be in some weird like manipulator game back and forth where me and Max are playing

2714
03:49:39,020 --> 03:49:41,980
like tug of war over the mind of like a vulnerable 24 year old. I think the thing that bothers me the

2715
03:49:41,980 --> 03:49:44,940
most is that Max, aside from like being like a literal rapist, like talking about like,

2716
03:49:44,940 --> 03:49:47,100
oh yeah, when women say no, I fuck them anyways because I know what they really want. It's

2717
03:49:47,100 --> 03:49:49,180
irritating that he's the one at the end of the day and then watching him manipulate and guess

2718
03:49:49,180 --> 03:49:52,220
who the fuck out of Lab on his stream. And like the pictures that Shaylin is drawing of him and

2719
03:49:52,220 --> 03:49:54,860
Max adopting her and then like him on stream trying to like pull it like, you've got to leave

2720
03:49:54,860 --> 03:49:58,140
Destiny's communion. I left for you. I left for you, Lab. No, you didn't, motherfucker. You left

2721
03:49:58,140 --> 03:50:01,500
because you got ass mad and now you're trying to suck more people into your orbit. To see somebody

2722
03:50:01,500 --> 03:50:04,700
that manipulative and that abusive, like I said, and I'll say this a million times, if anybody

2723
03:50:04,700 --> 03:50:07,020
wants to lead DMs, if they think where I'm being a manipulator, I'm being a manipulator, feel free

2724
03:50:07,020 --> 03:50:09,260
to do it. Go for it. Like I said, I'm usually really upfront with everybody at anything. If

2725
03:50:09,260 --> 03:50:11,420
I feel like somebody is like, oh, Destiny, I don't like this. Okay, fine. Then fucking leave. I won't

2726
03:50:11,420 --> 03:50:17,660
talk to you anymore. Like that's it. Yeah. Has Ana matured a lot off stream? From what we've seen,

2727
03:50:17,660 --> 03:50:20,060
she never seemed like somebody can engage on casual sex again. I think she probably can. Like

2728
03:50:20,060 --> 03:50:22,460
I said, me and Ana behind closed doors have been chill for literally like a year. Every now and

2729
03:50:22,460 --> 03:50:25,420
then she'll have a cycle on stream and then her and Kiwi farms like fucking egg each other on.

2730
03:50:25,420 --> 03:50:27,820
And then sometimes she'll like spam messages at me, but then like usually in a day or two,

2731
03:50:27,820 --> 03:50:29,740
she'll be like, oh, cause I looped. And I'll be like, okay, chill. And then it's just whatever,

2732
03:50:29,740 --> 03:50:32,140
like that's been more or less like the past like eight months of our conversation.

2733
03:50:34,220 --> 03:50:37,740
Well, I mean, that's good for her. It sounded like it sounded a lot worse before.

2734
03:50:41,980 --> 03:50:47,100
Leave, sex slave. What do you want? Can I say something? Sure, go for it. Okay. I just find it

2735
03:50:47,100 --> 03:50:53,660
incredibly abusive in the negative. The fact that he's using Anna as the foreground is battle

2736
03:50:53,660 --> 03:50:56,940
just for his benefit. And it's also really fucked too, because she started to message people. Now

2737
03:50:56,940 --> 03:51:03,820
he's using a lot of the language that he's used. Okay. Yeah. I can tell that he is like getting in

2738
03:51:03,820 --> 03:51:07,900
her head and like hyping her the fuck up on everything that he is saying about other people.

2739
03:51:07,900 --> 03:51:13,820
Yeah, exactly. And she's gone through, you know, rough shit. And this is him bringing her back on,

2740
03:51:13,820 --> 03:51:17,900
making her go back through, like back through everything that she's gone through before.

2741
03:51:18,460 --> 03:51:21,980
So this is ultra fucked up. And I don't think people are realizing how fucked up that is.

2742
03:51:21,980 --> 03:51:24,380
Yeah. Like, like I noticed this when she sent me this message, like a day ago,

2743
03:51:24,380 --> 03:51:28,220
where she's basically saying that, like, I get tons of hate and harassment from your community.

2744
03:51:28,220 --> 03:51:32,700
You know, this and you exploit this and you face no consequences. Big streamer news networks,

2745
03:51:32,700 --> 03:51:35,420
repeat your words, articles, get rid of the things you say. Like a lot of it is the same talking

2746
03:51:35,420 --> 03:51:38,700
points that I see max and lav and probably Shannon are like echoing. So I know that they've been

2747
03:51:38,700 --> 03:51:42,780
speaking to her. Oh, actually, I'm sorry. I know that I can't reveal that. I know that Anna has

2748
03:51:42,780 --> 03:51:45,420
been speaking to them a ton. And I know that max has been like mind fucking her a ton on a lot of

2749
03:51:45,420 --> 03:51:48,780
this shit. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, like she just told me right now, sorry to leave the dam from Anna.

2750
03:51:48,780 --> 03:51:51,340
And I just said, okay, fine. Max is telling me that you're going to go nuclear on me and

2751
03:51:51,340 --> 03:51:54,140
got me scared. I'm not going to go nuclear. Anna, because me and Anna don't have any problems. We

2752
03:51:54,140 --> 03:51:56,780
haven't had problems for literally a year. Sometimes she loops on stream about me and

2753
03:51:56,780 --> 03:51:58,940
it's annoying, but like I ignore it. I can just respond to it. And then like a day later, she's

2754
03:51:58,940 --> 03:52:01,100
like, oh shit, I looked and that's it. Boom. I haven't touched it for a year. That's it. We're

2755
03:52:01,100 --> 03:52:03,900
cool. Everything's been fine there for a long time, but max is like digging in and he's like

2756
03:52:03,900 --> 03:52:09,020
trying to like, because the problem, I think the thing that happened was after max built this

2757
03:52:09,020 --> 03:52:12,300
narrative of Anna, he realized he couldn't find a single other girl to reinforce the story because

2758
03:52:12,300 --> 03:52:15,980
it's bullshit. Um, and now he's like desperately trying to like hike the Anna shit and maybe try

2759
03:52:15,980 --> 03:52:19,100
to like get lab on it as well. But I don't know. That's the only thing I can think of.

2760
03:52:19,100 --> 03:52:23,180
And so the other thing is, this is one of, I guess, I don't know, this is me. This is not

2761
03:52:23,180 --> 03:52:26,540
you from your words or anything, but I feel like, like the situation with Anna was a big

2762
03:52:26,540 --> 03:52:30,700
vulnerability for you because it was a part of your life that was really tough. And not only

2763
03:52:30,700 --> 03:52:33,500
for you, but for Anna as well. Sure. Like a year or two ago when she was streaming,

2764
03:52:33,500 --> 03:52:35,500
like every single day talking about me and Zorka was forming whatever. Yeah,

2765
03:52:35,500 --> 03:52:38,060
that was fucking annoying. But yeah, but like for over a year, that's been like done.

2766
03:52:38,060 --> 03:52:41,500
No. Yeah. So everything's like chill now. And you and her are like on decent terms and just

2767
03:52:41,500 --> 03:52:45,020
talking as friends and stuff. And now he's bringing it, bringing it back to make it like go

2768
03:52:45,020 --> 03:52:48,220
absolutely bonkers. Yeah. I think another issue is I think somebody must've brought it up to them.

2769
03:52:48,220 --> 03:52:51,260
I don't know how many people know this, but it was brought up to either lab or max. Then they

2770
03:52:51,260 --> 03:52:55,340
brought it up on stream. And then max posted, like, was it like a hundred times in his subreddit

2771
03:52:55,340 --> 03:53:00,060
defending his characterization of the Anna stuff? I think that somebody can tell me if they were

2772
03:53:00,060 --> 03:53:05,020
watching the watching the subreddit. But yeah, max started to post a ton in his subreddit,

2773
03:53:05,020 --> 03:53:09,180
like attacking me, like overall the inertia. So I think that he wanted to I think that he wanted to

2774
03:53:09,180 --> 03:53:11,500
like bring that back up to like prove some shit about me basically. But yeah,

2775
03:53:11,500 --> 03:53:17,660
also something else I want to say. So him blaming you for what did he say just now? He said that

2776
03:53:17,660 --> 03:53:20,860
the fact that your community attacks her is because of the shit you say about her.

2777
03:53:20,860 --> 03:53:24,860
But Anna and I have been very friendly in the past. Like I have no personal issues with her.

2778
03:53:25,420 --> 03:53:29,660
The thing is I've said this to Anna directly as well. The more she speaks about it and she loops

2779
03:53:29,660 --> 03:53:33,980
on stream and all of that, the more your community and even other random people are

2780
03:53:33,980 --> 03:53:38,140
going to shit on her. So it's not what you say about her. Like, and you've stopped saying things

2781
03:53:38,140 --> 03:53:41,020
about her when she asked you to stop saying things about her. It's because she talks about

2782
03:53:41,020 --> 03:53:44,220
you on stream all the time. So like, you know, it's not even my community. It's usually like

2783
03:53:44,220 --> 03:53:47,580
the Kiwi farmers who she goes back and forth now. But yeah. Yeah. So it's not, I don't,

2784
03:53:47,580 --> 03:53:50,540
it seems like he knows, like surface, like he probably knows the situation, but he got

2785
03:53:51,180 --> 03:53:55,340
blaming everything on you is just, it's just bad faith. It's completely fake.

2786
03:53:55,340 --> 03:53:59,020
Excuse me. We do not sound the same. I don't understand.

2787
03:54:02,780 --> 03:54:08,220
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. Molina from the same country. Nope. Molina sounds like women.

2788
03:54:12,620 --> 03:54:16,220
I just heard girl with nice sounding light feminine voice. Okay.

2789
03:54:16,860 --> 03:54:21,980
You sound like a baguette since we sound like, I have a, it's a big, I got a strong baguette.

2790
03:54:22,860 --> 03:54:28,220
I am a strong baguette French baguette. Yes. So that's why I want to say, okay.

2791
03:54:36,700 --> 03:54:39,740
Yeah. I don't know if there's anything else to, I don't know if there's anything else to go over,

2792
03:54:39,740 --> 03:54:43,660
but I don't know if Max is planning on dropping a manifesto or some shit, if that's his like

2793
03:54:43,660 --> 03:54:46,060
fucking goal. I know that he's getting really frustrated because in the background, he's like,

2794
03:54:46,060 --> 03:54:47,980
he's saying that like, none of these girls are getting back to him. He's not getting the stories

2795
03:54:47,980 --> 03:54:50,300
that he wants. Maybe now that it's all public, you know, if you feel like you're a woman and

2796
03:54:50,300 --> 03:54:52,860
you've been abused by me, or if I've been sexually manipulating you, feel free to go

2797
03:54:52,860 --> 03:54:55,260
and talk to Max in the background and he'll give all the publicity to your story that you need.

2798
03:54:57,020 --> 03:55:01,580
Yeah. Watch the Shailen interview. I don't really want to, because like I said, I'm trying to be

2799
03:55:01,580 --> 03:55:04,620
Shailen is more of a victim than like anything else. From what I heard, I saw people in chat

2800
03:55:04,620 --> 03:55:08,380
typing things. It sounded like Shailen is basically like just 100% a microphone for Max.

2801
03:55:08,380 --> 03:55:11,020
She's just repeating all of his exact same talking points verbatim. She's probably been

2802
03:55:11,020 --> 03:55:14,620
abused by him for years now. I don't know if there's anything else. I don't really,

2803
03:55:14,620 --> 03:55:17,180
I'm not going to sit here and attack like a victim of his, you know, for days or hours.

2804
03:55:17,180 --> 03:55:19,740
Like it just seems kind of shitty. Uh, but I mean, I feel the same way about lab too,

2805
03:55:19,740 --> 03:55:24,860
even though I had high expectations, but once you want to post logs, um, of the things that Mr.

2806
03:55:24,860 --> 03:55:32,140
Case is, um, and I do know that there was some kind of story about, about Shailen's D trans

2807
03:55:32,140 --> 03:55:39,180
arc, how max D trans her. Hmm. I wonder if that all ended up just being copium too.

2808
03:55:40,140 --> 03:55:45,100
Oh man, just me spitballing here, but I don't know. I'm just no interpersonal stuff gets so

2809
03:55:45,100 --> 03:55:51,420
messy. It's so fucking messy. And it's like, let's let, let, let's assume we take

2810
03:55:51,420 --> 03:55:56,220
destiny at his word and maybe Shailen is fully the victim. If she's an adult,

2811
03:55:56,940 --> 03:56:00,060
what's still her responsibility. Now it's really tricky because

2812
03:56:03,100 --> 03:56:07,580
Max is older, right? There's so many, again, there's so, there's so many of these things

2813
03:56:07,580 --> 03:56:12,860
that make the situation riskier, more difficult and more complicated to analyze.

2814
03:56:15,260 --> 03:56:22,540
Hmm. But there's an element of like, she's also choosing to stay in this relationship. She's

2815
03:56:22,540 --> 03:56:27,900
choosing to defend him publicly like this. She like released the tweet about cherry and stardust

2816
03:56:27,900 --> 03:56:33,820
like, but we don't know what's going on behind the scenes. And it's really weird that Max refused to

2817
03:56:33,820 --> 03:56:41,900
let her come on stream until he wanted to attack. That's me basically like, why the shift? Why is

2818
03:56:41,900 --> 03:56:46,380
she suddenly on stream now? I do recall him saying in the past, like, I don't want her in

2819
03:56:46,380 --> 03:56:50,860
this space because it's my space and I wouldn't go into her space kind of thing. I think he said

2820
03:56:50,860 --> 03:56:55,180
something like that. And, and also, I guess there's just the wider point of like, is it really

2821
03:56:55,180 --> 03:56:59,660
possible to detran someone? Like if they're actually trans to force them through some,

2822
03:57:00,460 --> 03:57:03,500
through some method to make them not trans, like it doesn't seem possible to me.

2823
03:57:06,700 --> 03:57:08,780
That's a whole other topic. Yes.

2824
03:57:08,780 --> 03:57:17,820
Uh, it's a good question. Um, but I do know that she said with the trans stuff,

2825
03:57:17,820 --> 03:57:22,940
she was grateful to him for it. So it's like, the problem is like there. Yeah. I don't want

2826
03:57:22,940 --> 03:57:26,700
to get into like pig pilling and shit like that. I think it's a whole other conversation that is,

2827
03:57:26,700 --> 03:57:32,860
uh, yeah, but I will say she does say that she loves Max, that he's not abusing her,

2828
03:57:32,860 --> 03:57:36,220
that she's happy with her relationship, that people are wrongfully misconstruing their

2829
03:57:36,220 --> 03:57:40,540
relationship, that she's grateful that he transitioned her. Those are all of her statements,

2830
03:57:40,540 --> 03:57:46,140
just to be clear. And there's, there's also like, there's a, there are some strange relationship

2831
03:57:46,140 --> 03:57:51,820
dynamics where like, I know, I know one couple personally, where the guy just hits his girlfriend

2832
03:57:52,620 --> 03:57:56,620
and everyone who meets them is like, what the fuck? What the fuck is this? And they're both

2833
03:57:56,620 --> 03:58:01,740
like, no, we're okay with this. It's like, hold on. Are you just abused into being okay with this

2834
03:58:01,740 --> 03:58:05,420
or are you actually okay with this? And they're like, no, we're actually, it was like, I,

2835
03:58:05,420 --> 03:58:11,900
I want him to hit me. And it's like, uh, what do you say to that? I don't know. I don't know what

2836
03:58:11,900 --> 03:58:20,700
to say to that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is, this is a really, I mean, this is where I wouldn't,

2837
03:58:20,700 --> 03:58:25,740
I think there's some really, really cool women I know who work with like inter-partner violence

2838
03:58:25,740 --> 03:58:32,540
a lot. And it's really interesting having these conversations with them about being like, well,

2839
03:58:32,540 --> 03:58:38,300
what do you do with somebody? So for example, a different situation, but when I was working in the

2840
03:58:38,300 --> 03:58:45,020
teen non-voluntary lockup, there was a couple of girls who came into our facility, um, who were

2841
03:58:45,020 --> 03:58:52,220
being, I would say they were functionally being trafficked, but by their underage boyfriend,

2842
03:58:52,220 --> 03:58:55,660
but they were saying that they were okay with it and that they wanted it and that they were

2843
03:58:55,660 --> 03:58:59,900
just having like an open relationship, right? This is where it gets into really dicey things. Well,

2844
03:58:59,900 --> 03:59:05,580
like in the case of a child, we're way more willing as a society to say, no, it doesn't

2845
03:59:05,580 --> 03:59:10,940
matter if you think that this is okay. It's not okay. Right. Uh, so that's a little bit more

2846
03:59:10,940 --> 03:59:15,180
simple to solve. But then when you talk with people who example work with like women fleeing

2847
03:59:15,180 --> 03:59:19,100
domestic violence, I mean, the rate of which women who are fleeing domestic violence, go back to

2848
03:59:19,100 --> 03:59:24,140
their partner. It makes all of these things really complicated. Like so many people when

2849
03:59:24,140 --> 03:59:28,940
they talk about like domestic abuse or like inter-partner relate violence or, or, and whatnot,

2850
03:59:29,660 --> 03:59:33,980
they try to make it sound like it's this solved thing. And it's really simple. Um,

2851
03:59:33,980 --> 03:59:39,340
it's not simple. It's incredibly complicated. And as somebody with pretty minimal experience,

2852
03:59:39,340 --> 03:59:45,260
but who's talked to lots of people, it is an insanely complex situation. There's a lot of

2853
03:59:45,260 --> 03:59:50,380
mind-fucking that goes on that will cause people in the moment to say that things are fine and

2854
03:59:50,380 --> 03:59:55,100
really feel that it's fine and really feel like they're consenting that four to five years later,

2855
03:59:55,100 --> 03:59:59,020
when they're out of the relationship, they're like, holy fuck, no, I wasn't fine. No,

2856
03:59:59,020 --> 04:00:03,740
I wasn't consenting. And it's like, which person do you listen to? Our society empirically,

2857
04:00:03,740 --> 04:00:07,180
we tend to lean towards the later person, but like, there's this argument of being like,

2858
04:00:07,980 --> 04:00:11,340
if you're in the middle of it with a person, if you're in the middle of trying to convince them

2859
04:00:11,340 --> 04:00:16,220
not to go back to their domestic partner, which part of them do you listen to? Do you listen to

2860
04:00:16,220 --> 04:00:21,020
like what you think is best for them or what they're saying is best for them? Not an easy

2861
04:00:21,020 --> 04:00:28,060
answer. Really not an easy answer. Um, because if you don't listen to them, you're basically saying

2862
04:00:28,060 --> 04:00:32,860
your agency doesn't matter as much right now, which we can do, but then we have to own from

2863
04:00:32,860 --> 04:00:36,860
our chest that we're willing to do that sometimes. And it feels like our society isn't quite ready

2864
04:00:36,860 --> 04:00:40,940
for that. Because there's so many problems with it. Yeah, sorry.

2865
04:00:40,940 --> 04:00:47,100
This has been an inverse effect sometimes too, where like people weren't traumatized. And then

2866
04:00:47,100 --> 04:00:51,820
in the future, because of a new social circle that they're in, of people who are saying no,

2867
04:00:51,820 --> 04:00:55,660
I think you actually were traumatized. And then they kind of like convinced themselves that they

2868
04:00:55,660 --> 04:00:58,940
were then when they weren't, I think the also the inverse probably happens as well.

2869
04:00:58,940 --> 04:01:03,980
It does. It does. And so this is the issue like with the with the girl who's being trafficked,

2870
04:01:03,980 --> 04:01:09,420
there's multiple staff telling her that she's being traumatized. She probably was and is.

2871
04:01:09,420 --> 04:01:16,940
The problem is that, so this is my view, trauma and people's life experiences, their self narrative

2872
04:01:16,940 --> 04:01:23,340
are theirs and theirs alone. It is not your job ever as a person who loves them to impose your

2873
04:01:23,340 --> 04:01:28,940
perception of their narrative onto them. You can be like, this is maybe what I think is going on.

2874
04:01:28,940 --> 04:01:34,060
These are some of my thoughts. But it's really important, especially in my view with trauma,

2875
04:01:34,060 --> 04:01:40,700
to allow people to label it trauma, if and when they're ready, and only then. And I'm so lucky

2876
04:01:40,700 --> 04:01:45,500
that a lot of people in my life allowed me the liberty to do that. Because like I was like 19

2877
04:01:45,500 --> 04:01:49,660
to 20 before I realized that there was like some pretty like not okay stuff going on in my home

2878
04:01:49,660 --> 04:01:54,860
when I was a child. But I'm glad that I was given the space to make that decision on my own. And

2879
04:01:54,860 --> 04:01:57,900
finally, like I turned to one of my friends and I was like, I remember my friend handled this so

2880
04:01:57,900 --> 04:02:01,740
well because she knew all of my life. And I finally turned around like 20. And I was like,

2881
04:02:01,740 --> 04:02:06,780
I think there was actual like, I think there was some abuse going on in my home. And she's like,

2882
04:02:07,420 --> 04:02:11,500
why do you think that? And then I like explained stuff that she already knew. And I was like,

2883
04:02:11,500 --> 04:02:17,500
that's like, that's actually really abusive. And she was like, it is pretty abusive. Yeah. And I

2884
04:02:17,500 --> 04:02:23,740
was like, I think that's kind of why I'm fucked up a little bit. And she was like, possibly she's

2885
04:02:23,740 --> 04:02:27,420
like, you know, I've been thinking about that for a while. But I think it's really important that like

2886
04:02:27,500 --> 04:02:32,300
you come to that realization. And it's like, I'm so grateful for that friend. She was so wise

2887
04:02:32,300 --> 04:02:35,340
to hear my life story about some of the shit that was happening and not immediately go,

2888
04:02:35,340 --> 04:02:39,580
that's abuse. Because it's like the reality is that I wasn't ready at the time that I told her

2889
04:02:39,580 --> 04:02:44,540
to realize that it was abuse. And by the time I realized it, I was in a space in my life where I

2890
04:02:44,540 --> 04:02:49,500
was trying to understand who I was. And I was ready and big enough to like handle the scariness

2891
04:02:49,500 --> 04:02:55,020
that is to like, look at your childhood and be like, that shit was fucked. And it's really bad

2892
04:02:55,020 --> 04:02:59,500
in my view to rob somebody of the opportunity to move through that on their timing.

2893
04:03:00,460 --> 04:03:05,660
Yeah. And then there there is also seems to be the possibility that it actually isn't abuse,

2894
04:03:05,660 --> 04:03:11,180
right? Like you could have, it's conceivable that you that some people have some sort of kink

2895
04:03:11,180 --> 04:03:16,940
relationship where, yeah, there's there's just some, you know, one partner hits another partner

2896
04:03:16,940 --> 04:03:22,780
sometimes. Yeah, it's and they actually are like, completely fine with it. So there's, yeah, I

2897
04:03:22,780 --> 04:03:29,420
understand what you're saying. Any girls and other people really don't want to reveal who

2898
04:03:29,420 --> 04:03:32,620
they're coming from. Because I start posting, I mean, like, if max challenges me on anything,

2899
04:03:32,620 --> 04:03:35,340
I'll just start leaking, because I guess who the fuck cares. And I don't think any of these people.

2900
04:03:35,340 --> 04:03:43,420
I don't think any of these people care. Jesus, what it really, there's like clips of like,

2901
04:03:43,420 --> 04:03:47,180
lab, like almost compare me to Harvey Weinstein. Oh, Jesus.

2902
04:03:52,780 --> 04:04:00,860
His framing on this is so crazy. Sorry, just reading through some of these DMS.

2903
04:04:02,220 --> 04:04:06,140
I thought you and Destiny were friends. Well, we're friends. I guess I'll just read it. Fuck it.

2904
04:04:06,140 --> 04:04:08,140
I stopped working with him because I think he's abusive to his orbiters. And then I found out

2905
04:04:08,140 --> 04:04:12,460
he's been lying about and smearing the women he fucks. And then someone told me that he said he's

2906
04:04:12,460 --> 04:04:17,020
aroused by psychologically tormenting women. What I guess we're friends, but he's also a sociopath.

2907
04:04:17,100 --> 04:04:23,260
I'd like to figure out what's going on. The thing is, my hands are always tight because I don't,

2908
04:04:23,260 --> 04:04:25,660
I'm not gonna reveal every single person I've had a sexual relationship with because

2909
04:04:25,660 --> 04:04:28,460
it's for their privacy. Like there've been quite a few for sure. But like,

2910
04:04:30,700 --> 04:04:33,180
there are girls that I don't have sex with anymore because of reasons. And they still

2911
04:04:33,180 --> 04:04:35,580
come on the stream. Everything's fine. Some of them get girlfriends. Some of them get married.

2912
04:04:35,580 --> 04:04:37,580
Some of them like there's plenty of girls have been on that. I've never interacted with sexually.

2913
04:04:37,580 --> 04:04:39,900
There's been plenty people that have blown up, but I have and haven't interacted with sexually. Like

2914
04:04:39,900 --> 04:04:42,460
it's just like the craziest like story in his mind. I've had issues with guys, not issues with

2915
04:04:42,460 --> 04:04:48,300
guys. But I guess it's kind of hard to prove a negative. Well, I don't have to prove a negative.

2916
04:04:48,300 --> 04:04:53,500
Actually, he would have to prove the positive. Max really ended up becoming your super villain.

2917
04:04:53,500 --> 04:04:59,580
Yeah, I just, I feel like I put so much out there for him. It's actually insane. I was the only

2918
04:04:59,580 --> 04:05:04,140
person that was willing to listen to him after the weird like shit with Vash. I steal man the fuck

2919
04:05:04,140 --> 04:05:12,860
out of like his like basically pro rape videos. Are you worried that Max is gonna stop? I'm

2920
04:05:12,860 --> 04:05:15,260
worried that I'm gonna become like a new Dr. K for him. And now he's just gonna go like full

2921
04:05:15,260 --> 04:05:18,620
fucking. This is gonna be what he spends the next like three months on is just basically

2922
04:05:18,620 --> 04:05:26,140
publishing videos about me. But here's here's something that I'm that I'm wondering, and maybe

2923
04:05:26,140 --> 04:05:38,460
it's it sounds a bit victim blaming. And that's that's never good. But maybe we can explore the

2924
04:05:38,460 --> 04:05:47,100
idea anyway. Destiny has created so many of his own villains. Yeah. At what at what point do you

2925
04:05:47,100 --> 04:05:55,100
think it's it's reasonable to say, Hey, what am I doing? You know that I that I've made Vash and

2926
04:05:55,100 --> 04:05:59,820
Hassan and now Mr. Girl and everyone else who's burned a bridge? What is it that I'm doing that's

2927
04:05:59,820 --> 04:06:07,100
causing this? Man, okay, this is for sure going to be a mind read. So I could be wrong. And

2928
04:06:15,020 --> 04:06:17,660
have you ever seen the interview with Dr. K and Steven?

2929
04:06:18,540 --> 04:06:19,180
No, I have not.

2930
04:06:20,060 --> 04:06:25,260
This is why I maintain some level of respect for Dr. K, even though I disagree with like certain

2931
04:06:25,260 --> 04:06:31,820
things that he does. I think Dr. K had the most accurate read of Steven within three hours that

2932
04:06:31,820 --> 04:06:37,260
I think I've seen anyone do, which is that they talked about this idea that basically like to

2933
04:06:37,260 --> 04:06:42,380
operate and function within the highly volatile, highly like, intense space that he's in, that's

2934
04:06:43,340 --> 04:06:50,140
so toxic. He's essentially like, closed the door to certain colors of like, essentially a human

2935
04:06:50,140 --> 04:06:55,020
experience in his life. And some of that is emotionality, right? The biggest driver I think

2936
04:06:55,020 --> 04:07:01,100
for I know this because I asked him about it publicly, the biggest motivation for him is fun

2937
04:07:01,100 --> 04:07:06,220
and interesting. Anything that kind of gets his gears going is what he loves the most.

2938
04:07:06,220 --> 04:07:10,700
And the problem is that

2939
04:07:14,300 --> 04:07:24,380
bad people, or unhinged people, or sometimes mentally unwell people or bad actors can be damn

2940
04:07:24,380 --> 04:07:30,540
interesting people. And if you enjoy fighting with people, they can be particularly interesting.

2941
04:07:31,500 --> 04:07:38,140
The problem is that that's not a good metric of who to trust. And so this is something I think

2942
04:07:38,140 --> 04:07:42,700
he would maybe not agree with me. And I think there's definitely a situation, an issue going

2943
04:07:42,700 --> 04:07:50,060
on that like, I don't know if he has the best metric of precisely who is trustworthy and who

2944
04:07:50,060 --> 04:07:54,060
is not. And I think there's a second thing that's going on. And because of his position of like,

2945
04:07:54,300 --> 04:08:00,620
such large amounts of fame for so long, he doesn't have to pursue friendships.

2946
04:08:00,620 --> 04:08:07,260
Mostly people come to him and pursue him. And this is a similar issue, actually, that my best

2947
04:08:07,260 --> 04:08:12,860
friend has. She's just like, she's just an incredible, she's just a really cool person.

2948
04:08:12,860 --> 04:08:17,020
People fucking love the shit on my best friend. Everyone wants to be her friend. And I remember

2949
04:08:17,020 --> 04:08:21,420
in high school, she'd have people like following her around unironically, just trying to spend time

2950
04:08:22,060 --> 04:08:25,980
with her because she's just like, she's just got gravity. We would always joke that she has like

2951
04:08:25,980 --> 04:08:29,660
crazy animal pheromones or something because people were just like drawn to her always.

2952
04:08:30,540 --> 04:08:36,860
And what we realized when she was like hitting major crises in her life is that she had very,

2953
04:08:36,860 --> 04:08:41,580
very few friends around her that were of depth and substance that she could rely on. And she

2954
04:08:41,580 --> 04:08:46,780
didn't even know who they were because she'd never really had to pick and pursue somebody.

2955
04:08:46,780 --> 04:08:52,220
She'd always had people kind of thrust upon her. And she would look at me and she'd be like,

2956
04:08:52,220 --> 04:08:57,580
you have amazing friendships. You have really good friends. You can really rely on them.

2957
04:08:59,180 --> 04:09:04,860
What's the difference here? And I was like, well, I pursue friendships. I've never ever had somebody

2958
04:09:04,860 --> 04:09:09,340
try to pursue a friendship with me because people think I'm a bitch when I think I'm intimidating,

2959
04:09:09,340 --> 04:09:12,460
whatever the fuck that means. I think that usually just means that you're a bitch and they want to

2960
04:09:12,460 --> 04:09:16,860
say nice things. And I'm highly disagreeable. And I've never really been a part of like

2961
04:09:17,580 --> 04:09:21,500
Christian girl club very well because I always want to fight with men about theology.

2962
04:09:24,460 --> 04:09:27,180
Well, I haven't gotten that impression from you so far.

2963
04:09:27,180 --> 04:09:33,580
I've grown a lot. And because of that, I always selected my friends and then pursued them.

2964
04:09:34,620 --> 04:09:39,180
And because of that, I could just look at the crowds of people, watch how they treated others

2965
04:09:39,180 --> 04:09:43,260
and go, that's a good person, and then pursue them as a friend. And that's what I did. I would

2966
04:09:43,260 --> 04:09:48,140
literally be like, she seems based. And then I would pick them and pursue them as a friend.

2967
04:09:48,140 --> 04:09:52,700
And this is my reality. I'm always really close friends with people who are insanely popular,

2968
04:09:52,700 --> 04:09:58,380
but nobody likes me that much. That's like Nick, too. Nick, everyone fucking loves the shit out of

2969
04:09:58,380 --> 04:10:04,620
Nick. But in fairness, he pursued me. That was a bit of a different dynamic. So I suspect it's

2970
04:10:04,620 --> 04:10:09,580
a mixture of these things going on for destiny. And if he'd like, learn to basically pursue the

2971
04:10:09,580 --> 04:10:13,900
friends that are meaningful, I think he would see a major offset of this. But I think that's a tricky

2972
04:10:14,700 --> 04:10:18,860
thing to learn and realize. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is. I mean, some of that story sounds familiar

2973
04:10:18,860 --> 04:10:25,900
to me just because like, I get 100 DMS a day, just just being my size. If I if I ever lacked for,

2974
04:10:27,020 --> 04:10:32,060
let's say, non sexual companionship, all I would have to do is talk to a fan. And they'd be like,

2975
04:10:33,020 --> 04:10:36,300
whenever I whenever I apply to a demon, so I was like, Oh, my God, you're actually talking to me.

2976
04:10:36,300 --> 04:10:39,900
This is amazing. It's like, it's not that amazing, dude. Like, I'm, I'm pretty normal guy. But they

2977
04:10:39,900 --> 04:10:46,380
see as amazing. And like, and sometimes I think I have Jesus, like, I sometimes have ego problems.

2978
04:10:46,380 --> 04:10:50,300
And I'm like, Listen, you're not actually that amazing. You got to calm down, calm down the ego.

2979
04:10:50,300 --> 04:10:56,540
But like, if I ever I don't, I don't, I'm at a point now, that because of having fans, I don't

2980
04:10:56,540 --> 04:11:01,580
need to like also pursue people, right? I can, if I want, if I want a giant room full of Yes, man,

2981
04:11:01,580 --> 04:11:08,620
I can have it. But I don't want that, you know. Um, so I guess I kind of empathize with that.

2982
04:11:09,260 --> 04:11:13,980
It sounds like it makes a lot of sense. And maybe it maybe applies to me as well on some level.

2983
04:11:13,980 --> 04:11:21,100
Um, there's something about me, though. So so we've hit the soft end point that you wanted to

2984
04:11:21,100 --> 04:11:26,540
give Naomi at 1030. All right, get out of here. I will I will leave the call if you don't. I respect

2985
04:11:26,540 --> 04:11:31,180
relationships and I respect hold on. Give me a couple minutes before I get out of here. Okay.

2986
04:11:31,980 --> 04:11:35,820
Let me give you my final thoughts. So you have two minutes to somebody in your

2987
04:11:36,380 --> 04:11:40,620
somebody also somebody in your chat is saying that you should go talk to Justin before he leaves

2988
04:11:40,620 --> 04:11:46,220
because he's putting is apparently putting a moratorium on Mr. Girl content. So maybe it's

2989
04:11:46,220 --> 04:11:50,940
it would be better for you to talk to him than me right now. Um, I guess thanks very much for

2990
04:11:51,500 --> 04:11:58,220
for talking to me. It was very fun. And I want to do it some more. Because this is a very enjoyable

2991
04:11:58,220 --> 04:12:03,660
experience for me. I don't talk to the side of the internet much. And I've been slowly, you know,

2992
04:12:03,660 --> 04:12:10,620
stepping my toes, slowly muddying dirtying your hands. Yeah, I do have one request, if you don't

2993
04:12:10,620 --> 04:12:17,020
mind. And you can completely say no. I'm not going to take it in any negative way. Yeah.

2994
04:12:17,020 --> 04:12:22,060
Because it is your show fully believe you've been extremely charitable and flexible. So

2995
04:12:22,860 --> 04:12:29,660
Oh, well, thank you. Um, I did an absolutely terrible job of explaining the contents of my

2996
04:12:29,660 --> 04:12:34,700
three forms of fascism video. And I should have looked it over. I'm gonna watch it. We're gonna

2997
04:12:34,700 --> 04:12:41,260
watch it. Yeah. Hold on. We're gonna watch it together. My that's your girlfriend being like,

2998
04:12:41,260 --> 04:12:44,540
get the fuck off the internet. Let's go on a fucking date already. Oh my god.

2999
04:12:45,260 --> 04:12:52,620
I guess the TLDR is I did a very poor job of explaining that to your chat. And so if you

3000
04:12:53,500 --> 04:12:58,220
are so inclined, I would be appreciative if you showed them the video. You don't have to,

3001
04:12:58,220 --> 04:13:01,020
but maybe it makes some good content for you reacting to it.

3002
04:13:01,020 --> 04:13:09,100
Sounds good. Okay, thanks very much. Let's talk again. Okay, anybody. See ya. Bye, everyone.
