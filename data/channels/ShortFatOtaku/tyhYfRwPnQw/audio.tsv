0	9140	Hello my friends, the title of this video should be self-explanatory, but in case you
9140	13960	don't get it, this is just going to be a brief primer on how I research things.
13960	17280	Because I don't necessarily want you to think like me whenever I make videos or I
17280	21640	do streams, but I do want you to at least learn the processes by which I come to the
21640	23260	conclusions that I come to.
23260	27700	Because in my opinion, finding the truth is more important than any sort of political
27700	28700	expediency.
28700	32780	Neither the left nor the right, no political camp, no ideological camp, no religion, nothing
32780	35620	has a monopoly on what the truth is.
35620	36780	Lots of people say that they do.
36780	42420	If they say my view is always correct, my tribe knows what the truth is all the time,
42420	45700	they're trying to sell you something, whether it's the far left, far right, doesn't matter.
45700	50340	So I just want to take two examples from either side of the aisle and just show you how to
50340	52220	really get the truth out of them.
52220	53220	Here's the first one.
53220	56500	This one I actually did live on the weekly sip a few weeks back, but I figured I'd just
56500	61200	do it again just to show you my thought processes on when I try to find what the truth is.
61200	62560	So this is from Vice News.
62560	66540	Far right extremists are threatening to execute doctors at a children's hospital.
66540	70300	The viral Twitter account Lives of TikTok promoted a lie about gender affirming care
70300	72820	at the hospital and now doctors are getting death threats.
72820	73820	Well, okay.
73820	75140	So let's see what the claim is.
75140	79420	Boston Children's Hospital said on Tuesday that its staff has faced a flood of violent
79420	84760	threats and harassment sparked by a false claim made by the viral Lives of TikTok account.
84760	89640	The account tweeted on August 11th that Boston's Children's Hospital is now offering gender
89640	92200	affirming hysterectomies for young girls.
92200	98160	The claim has been widely debunked by fact-checking groups, but as is typical in anti-trans rhetoric,
98160	102380	facts rarely matter and the claims were shared widely on right-wing social media accounts.
102380	105160	As a result, the hospital and its staff have faced a torrent of abuse.
105160	109520	They've received hostile internet activity, phone calls, harassing emails, including threats
109520	111360	of violence towards clinicians and staff.
111360	115500	And then the article gets into the various death threats and threats of assault made
115500	116500	by people on the internet.
116500	117660	On the one hand, I get it.
117660	118660	You shouldn't be getting those.
118660	119880	And the other hand is just the internet.
119880	121720	It's like cyberbullying ain't real.
121720	122720	Turn it off.
122720	126380	You know the quote at this point, but let's actually see what the truth is because this
126380	130960	article at this point focuses only on the fallout, but what's the truth of the claim?
130960	136680	Is it true that Boston Children's Hospital is now offering gender affirming hysterectomies
136680	138200	for young girls?
138200	140680	Now the claim has been widely debunked by fact-checking groups.
141000	142000	Let's see those fact-checkers.
142000	145640	Yeah, there's a political fact saying false, but I mean, PolitiFact, they're kind of biased
145640	146640	as it is.
146640	149440	There's always the memes, oh, it's been debunked.
149440	151700	And then you look at the debunking and it's just like fucking stupid.
151700	153140	So we don't necessarily need to trust this.
153140	155560	This is at least one data point, but it's not the whole truth.
155560	157160	So let's actually look at it ourselves.
157160	161020	The first thing that I would do when trying to find the truth of a claim like this is
161020	162840	to look at the quote itself.
162840	164200	Let's find the original tweet.
164200	166800	Oh, at this point, libs of TikTok might actually be taken down.
166800	167800	Nope.
167800	168800	It's still there.
168800	170000	And the tweet is actually right here.
170000	173920	Boston Children's Hospital is now offering gender-affirming hysterectomies for young
173920	174920	girls.
174920	178640	So let's watch this video and see what's actually going on here, okay?
178640	183800	Gender-affirming hysterectomy is very similar to most hysterectomies that occur.
183800	187520	Hysterectomy itself is the removal of the uterus, the cervix, which is the opening of
187520	191980	the uterus, and the fallopian tubes, which are attached to the sides of the uterus.
191980	195640	Some gender-affirming hysterectomies will also include the removal of the ovaries, but
195640	199200	that's technically a separate procedure called a bilateral oophrectomy.
199480	203480	Not every gender-affirming hysterectomy includes that, and people who are getting gender-affirming
203480	206120	hysterectomies do not have to have their ovaries removed.
209120	214980	Okay, so that video didn't actually say what libs of TikTok said that it did.
214980	219640	That was a video describing what a gender-affirming hysterectomy is, but said nothing about young
219640	220640	girls.
220640	223740	Maybe they're making a jump in logic here, because the video did come from the Boston
223740	227980	Children's Hospital, and you know, that is a point, but let's continue to dig and see
228260	229260	what's actually going on.
229260	232740	Special report, Boston Children's Hospital boasts a full suite of surgical options for
232740	237040	transgender teens, has 90 videos promoting surgeries to youth on their YouTube page.
237040	242540	Co-director allows vaginoplasty on 17-year-olds, but hints at even younger.
242540	244420	Okay, let's see what this is all about.
244420	248620	So when I see this sentence, I really want to know where the hints at even younger comes
248620	249620	from.
249620	250620	Where's the source of this stuff?
250620	252520	We have to look this up, so let's head in.
252520	257020	Boston Children's Hospital gleefully encourages surgical, pharmaceutical, gender transition
257060	258060	for teens.
258060	262340	Dr. Oren Gennor, co-director of the Boston Children's Center for Gender Surgery, said
262340	267860	in an email to WBUR that he was slightly flexible when it comes to the age of males seeking
267860	268860	at genital surgery.
268860	270180	This is a video series.
270180	272500	This is their YouTube channel.
272500	274980	Oh, they deleted the playlist.
274980	276660	Yep, here's the channel.
276660	279640	Not much engagement on these videos, but I mean, that's fine.
279640	281420	They're here for, they're not here to be YouTubers.
281420	283760	I'm not sure if these are, you know, promoted to children.
283760	286620	They seem to be like straightforward videos on information.
287220	292140	Boston Children's Hospital founded the Gender Multispecialty Service Program in 2007 and
292140	294460	welcomes patients as young as three years old.
294460	295460	That sounds kind of crazy.
295460	298280	I assume they're not doing surgeries on people three years old.
298280	302380	At GEMS, our mission is to assess and care for gender diverse children, teens, and young
302380	303380	adults.
303380	306940	Young adults makes me think that it's not just children going to the children's hospital,
306940	308380	that it's over eight teens.
308380	312140	GEMS provides a variety of options for medical transition that include prescribing puberty
312140	315180	blockers, testosterone, estrogen, plastic surgery in their surgery center.
315180	316300	Okay, okay, okay, okay.
316300	319420	For children nine and under, the hospital helps facilitate a social transition that
319420	323220	prepares them for individualized treatment plans that can include puberty blockers, cross
323220	325380	sex hormones, and chest surgeries.
325380	327340	Chest surgeries are available at age 15.
327340	330620	Well, okay, there's one thing that I disagree with right off the bat.
330620	333100	Surgery should be coming at 18, not 15.
333100	338880	So I disagree with this, but we still haven't reached Libs of TikTok's claim yet that hysterectomies
338880	341100	are being offered to young girls.
341100	345900	Genital surgeries require several letters of support from the patient's healthcare providers
345900	349940	and must have lived as their identified gender for only 12 months.
349940	355620	For phalloplasty and metoidoplasty, they ask that you be at least 18 years old.
355620	356900	18 seems reasonable.
356900	357980	At that point, you're an adult.
357980	359180	You do what you want with your body.
359180	364460	Patients only 17 years old can obtain a vaginoplasty, but Dr. Oren Gennor, co-director of Boston
364460	368020	Children's Center for the Dead, hinted in an email that children even younger can be
368020	369020	operated on.
369020	372340	Gennor said in an email that he is slightly flexible when it comes to the age of males
372340	373540	seeking genital surgery.
373540	377420	He adds that the policy has not been finalized because of the issue around consent for sterilization,
377420	378860	which is a part of the procedure.
378860	381380	Let's see the standards of care model they're talking about.
381380	383380	Professional Association for Transgender Health.
383380	385380	Oh, this is a big ass document.
385380	387620	We've got to look at this, don't we?
387620	388620	Fuck.
388620	389620	English version 2012, loading in.
389620	392740	Can we just search for 18?
392740	393740	Pass page 18.
393740	394740	Surgery, maybe?
394740	395740	Surgery, page 54.
395740	402740	Active health, voice therapy, surgery.
402740	407780	Area for breast or chest surgery, creation of a male chest and FTM patients, persistent
407780	411860	well-documented gender dysphoria, capacity to make fully informed decision into consent,
411860	413820	age of majority in the given country.
413820	417680	If significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well-controlled.
417680	420780	Breast augmentation and MTF, same things.
420780	423660	Persistent well-documented gender dysphoria, capacity to make an informed decision, age
423660	426000	of majority, and these all seem to be the same.
426000	429280	They all say age of majority in a given country.
429280	434000	So if we were to go back, when we have chest surgeries available at the age of 15, that's
434000	435000	bad.
435000	438160	It's not what Libs of TikTok talks about in that tweet, but it is bad.
438160	441800	And patients 17 years old can obtain a vaginoplasty.
441800	442800	That's also bad.
442800	444200	It has to be 18 across the board.
444200	447920	And when he says he is slightly flexible, this is a serious problem.
447920	452320	So there's a lot of things happening right now at this Boston Children's Hospital that
452320	453320	I disagree with.
453320	457220	And in fact, the standard of care also disagrees with this stuff.
457220	462420	But the original claim was not about chest surgeries at 15 or puberty blockers at nine,
462420	464020	vaginoplasty is at 17.
464020	469000	The original claim was gender affirming hysterectomies for young girls.
469000	471620	There does not seem to be any proof of that.
471620	473260	There's proof of other wrongdoing.
473260	477340	And if Libs of TikTok wanted to be factually correct, they could have reported on that
477340	478480	wrongdoing, but they didn't.
478480	483340	They chose to say gender affirming hysterectomies for young girls, which does not seem to be
483340	484340	the truth.
484340	486260	Now, the final point is that, oh, it's a children's hospital.
486300	489500	Well, of course, if they're going after kids, it's not adults getting it there, dude.
489500	492060	I saw people in the weekly sip chat actually say that quite a bit.
492060	496900	The only thing I have to say to that is that a while ago, the Boston Children's Hospital
496900	503380	extended the age range from 18 to 21, saying that's a little help for those college years.
503380	507300	Even though it is a children's hospital, it still has no problem treating young adults
507300	512660	from 18 to 21 and sometimes even treats full adults that need certain types of care.
512660	517380	Despite the chest surgeries at 15, despite the vaginoplasty at 17, both of which are
517380	523560	really bad things, this specific claim, gender affirming hysterectomies for young girls seems
523560	526140	to be false, or at the very least, they can't prove it.
526140	531580	Now, for example, if this tweet read, Boston Children's Hospital is offering gender affirming
531580	537620	vaginoplasty for young boys, that's actually a more accurate tweet, as we saw the policy
537620	540860	is 17, but that one doctor is willing to bend the rules on it.
540860	542900	So in that case, it wouldn't be a false claim.
542900	544460	But this claim is false.
544460	546720	Now at this point, I already hear your objection.
546720	548220	What does it matter if this claim is false?
548220	551660	Because the hospital is still bad, yes, but we have to be accurate.
551660	555700	We can't just go into this all willy nilly and just say whatever because there's some
555700	556700	bad stuff happening.
556700	558860	No, you can't be them.
558860	559940	You have to be accurate.
559940	564180	If I can dismantle this tweet through some simple Google searches, libs of TikTok looks
564180	568300	like a fucking moron, and now their credibility is shot, so if they come back with, say, something
568300	570740	that's actually real, who knows if it's true?
570740	574060	And while this is an example that kind of needles the right a little bit, I have an
574060	576640	equivalent example that kind of needles the left.
576640	579780	Here's something that Lilith sent me, and she was like, oh my God, they're finally doing
579780	580780	it.
580780	581780	They're finally coming for us.
581780	582780	Well, let's look at this claim too.
582780	587620	Approximately 9,000 transgender Floridians woke up today to find out they no longer have
587620	589460	life saving Medicaid coverage.
589460	594840	DeSantis bypassed the legislature and weaponized state agencies against his own constituents
594840	596800	for simply minding their own business.
596800	598100	This is not freedom.
598100	601260	Just like in the previous case, let's not take anyone's word for it.
601260	605900	Let's investigate this claim, because clearly this guy isn't exactly a neutral source.
605900	608740	He's Florida's first LGBTQ Latino legislature.
608740	613220	There are some articles on this change, discriminatory DeSantis administration regulation eliminating
613220	617560	Medicaid coverage for 9,000 plus transgender Floridians take effect this weekend.
617560	621540	This weekend on August 21st, Florida's agency for the healthcare administration shamelessly
621540	625620	executing the DeSantis administration's discriminatory agenda will rip away access to life-setting
625620	628700	Medicare for more than 9,000 transgender Floridians.
628700	631180	I hope this isn't just like the meme, like the over 9,000.
631180	632860	I hope it's not just that, okay?
632860	634020	What's the deal here?
634020	635980	Where does this number come from and where did this come from?
635980	640820	Well, it turns out that this tweet, while at least somewhat accurate, is written in
640820	643420	the most inflammatory possible way.
643420	645380	DeSantis bypassed the legislature.
645380	650740	Well, Florida's agency for healthcare administration is an organization under the purview of the
650740	651740	governor.
651740	653740	The legislature has no place in this process.
653740	657900	It's not bypassing the legislature if he's doing what the powers of his office allows
657900	658900	him to do.
658900	663260	Secondly, 9,000 transgender Floridians woke up today to find out they no longer have life-setting
663260	664260	coverage.
664260	665260	This implies that it just happened overnight.
665260	666260	It's like, what the fuck?
666260	667260	I woke up in this.
667260	668260	No, no, no, no, no.
668260	669260	This happened back on August 5th.
669260	672100	Florida medical board moves to block gender affirming treatments for minors.
672100	674620	The board also voted to start the process of requiring adults seeking such care to wait
674620	676900	24 hours for going forward with any medical procedures.
676900	678340	This was not something that came out of nowhere.
678340	680580	People woke up to him and was like, oh my God, it just happened.
680580	681580	No, no, no, no.
681580	682580	People have known this has been coming for weeks.
682580	686580	The medical board was following guidance from the Florida department of health, which
686580	688680	has claimed that there's not enough research.
688680	690260	So let's see what this guidance was.
690260	691260	404 not found.
691260	692260	It's gone.
692260	693260	That's okay.
693260	694260	I have a copy of it here.
694260	697800	This was published on June 2nd, 2022 for the board of medicine members of the board.
697800	702220	On April 20th, 2022, the Florida department of health released guidance in the treatment
702220	703220	for you.
703220	706300	So as the state, certain general, I recommend against certain pharmaceutical, non-pharmaceutical
706300	709620	and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria recommendations are based on a lack of conclusive
709620	712420	evidence and the high risk for long-term irreversible harms.
712420	717860	The overview conducted by Dr. Brindarnello Peterson, okay.
717860	720900	And Dr. Weircock, what the fuck are these names, dude?
720900	724300	The research where the doctors state that there is great uncertainty about the effects
724300	729600	of puberty blockers, cross sex hormones, and surgeries in young people with gender dysphoria.
729600	732480	So young people does not necessarily mean adults.
732480	735580	So I don't know where the 9,000 adults number comes from.
735580	739500	I don't necessarily agree with what's in this message, but this is guidance on what the
739500	744420	state should do, not necessarily where that 9,000, where does that 9,000 number come from
744420	747420	when he says 9,000 transgender Floridians.
747420	752100	The actual agency we're talking about doesn't have anything, no news post or anything related
752100	754080	to this change that apparently went into effect.
754080	756520	Why it's happening on the day that they say it's happening.
756520	759020	Why it's 9,000 transgender people.
759020	760100	There's no source for that.
760100	764400	Whenever an article like this one from the 19th to the 21st talks about it, all of their
764400	767180	sources end up leading back to the same date.
767180	769620	A series of articles published on August 5th.
769620	773540	However, those articles all refer to minors, not adults.
773540	779220	This implies that it's just people, not children, but just general people of age.
779220	781620	We have to find the source of this 9,000 number.
781620	784020	It's not appearing anywhere, anywhere I look.
784020	785900	And I think I might have it.
785900	791380	This is from the Williams Institute from 2019, Medicaid coverage for gender affirming care.
791380	795420	Let's do a control F for 9,000.
797220	798220	Nothing.
798220	800460	How about 9,000 with a comma?
800460	801460	Fewer than half.
801460	802460	Okay, that's just 69,000.
802460	804540	Oh, here we go.
804540	807700	There's a 9,000 entry for Florida under this table.
807700	810500	Table one, Medicaid enrollment of transgender adults by state.
810500	812020	Okay, so let's see here.
812020	819660	So for example, Alaska has 2,700 transgender adults and 1,000 of those adults are enrolled
819660	824780	in Medicaid and their gender affirming care is not covered by Medicaid or less than 1,000
824780	825780	adults.
826220	832380	There's 8450 transgender adults, 1,000 are enrolled in Medicaid and those 1,000 don't
832380	833380	have their care covered.
833380	834380	Okay.
834380	840100	In California, there's 218,000 transgender adults and 16,000 of them are on Medicaid
840100	841740	and their gender affirming care is covered.
841740	843060	Okay, that's what this is.
843060	850780	This third column, Florida has 100,000 transgender adults, 9,000 of those adults are on Medicaid
850780	855260	and Medicaid in Florida has no policy on gender affirming care.
855260	859000	So I guess in that case, it's just up to the individual doctor.
859000	860280	Maybe they approve it, maybe they don't.
860280	865500	For around 51,000 transgender Medicaid beneficiaries, coverage is uncertain because they live in
865500	869660	states where the laws are silent on Medicare coverage for gender affirming care.
869660	872640	The law doesn't say anything guaranteeing it or denying it.
872640	875660	So it's just going to be based on whatever the doctor thinks you need.
875660	879500	So that seems to be where the 9,000 number comes from is this table.
879500	880540	Now here's what I don't understand.
880540	885020	Whenever you have an article like this that says that the rules are changing for Medicaid
885020	891220	coverage, all of the sources eventually lead back to other articles that talk about minors,
891220	892220	not adults.
892220	898520	But this 9,000 figure comes from this collection of data that is specifically about adults.
898520	901500	So there seems to be two true statements here.
901500	907140	The first one is that 9,000 trans adults in Florida are on Medicaid and that the state
907140	911460	does not explicitly confirm or deny access to care through Medicaid.
911460	912460	That's a true statement.
912460	917260	The second true statement is that the rules regarding transitioning for children are changing
917260	918260	right now.
918260	923020	It seems to be the case that people are taking these two independent true statements and
923020	929760	mashing them together saying that those 9,000 transgender adults in Florida who are on Medicaid
929760	934740	coverage are somehow going to be affected by the rule change even though the rule change,
934740	937980	at least as far as I can tell, only seems to apply to children.
937980	940120	So how did this mess up happen?
940120	944320	How is it that this guy only read the headline to this article and then didn't look into
944320	948880	it and find out where this number comes from or go through the sources provided in the
948880	951620	article to get back to the source where it's only about minors?
951620	952760	How did this fuck up happen?
952760	956240	Well the answer to that can be found in this Politico article.
956240	961200	Simone Tris, director of the Southern Legal Council Transgender Rights Initiative said
961200	965400	on Wednesday that the coalition is expecting to file the case in federal court and will
965400	968100	seek a preliminary injunction to halt the ban from going forward.
968100	973180	So this is some kind of advocacy group that is going ahead and filing lawsuits against
973180	975780	the rule change that DeSantis wants to implement.
975780	979600	Simone Tris, remember the lawyer for this advocacy group says that Florida's ban will
979600	984780	affect up to 9,000 of the state's Medicaid enrollees who are transgender.
984780	987620	Florida joins either states that have already banned Medicaid dollars from going to gender
987620	988620	affirming care.
988620	989620	Okay, okay, okay.
989620	994100	So the first person to bring up the number 9,000 in the context of this conversation
994100	998840	is the lawyer for the advocacy group that is looking to stop the rule change.
998840	1002580	Now presumably she got the number from this data set, so it's not like it's just a made
1002580	1004320	up number, it is an accurate number.
1004320	1009520	But this is why the lawyer said that the ban will affect up to 9,000.
1009520	1010760	So here's what's actually happening.
1010760	1014940	This person just directly said that approximately 9,000 transgender Floridians woke up today
1014940	1017580	to find out they no longer have life saving Medicaid coverage.
1017580	1023780	The 9,000 number comes from a data set regarding adults and the rule change seems to be affecting
1023780	1025060	predominantly children.
1025060	1029420	And the reason that these two were mushed together to appear to be part of the same
1029420	1035760	thing is because a lawyer for an advocacy group said up to 9,000 people may be affected
1035760	1036760	by this change.
1036760	1041500	That's a far cry from 9,000 people just woke up and found their rights eviscerated
1041500	1042500	by the state.
1042500	1046160	This number's use is from a lawyer who is making their case.
1046160	1050980	We expect them to put their best foot forward just like we expect their opponents to also
1050980	1054700	put their best foot forward and then let the judge hash it out in court.
1054700	1058620	Now I'm not sure if this change is actually good but you can see how every step of the
1058620	1062580	way the real information twists a little bit more and a little bit more until it starts
1062580	1066140	to sound like those scenes from V for Vendetta where the police are busting into people's
1066140	1070060	homes and dragging them away for just living a private life where they might be a deviant
1070060	1071060	or something.
1071060	1073380	It doesn't matter if you're left wing, right wing listening to this video.
1073380	1077800	If you are partisan you probably looked at the part of the video that makes your side
1077800	1081280	look good and you're like yeah of course this is really good, good digging dev you
1081280	1083720	did it and then you're looking at the part of the video that makes your side look bad
1083720	1087080	and you're like well you're just stretching the truth or you're just being partisan or
1087080	1092060	you just don't understand or you can't you know this is me doing my best to research
1092060	1093940	the topics as good faith as I can.
1093940	1095160	Now I could be wrong.
1095160	1100280	I'm not coming into it to make either the pro-trans or the anti-trans lobby look good
1100280	1101280	or bad.
1101280	1105040	I want to know what the truth is and the reason that I feel this strongly about it is because
1105040	1109480	there has to be some kind of standard, there has to be some kind of neutral territory in
1109480	1114120	which we can come together even though we believe different things and hash out the
1114120	1116880	agreement that allows us to live together in peace.
1116880	1122760	You can't simply destroy the overarching superstructure that you use to negotiate with each other
1122760	1124360	in the name of political expediency.
1124360	1129400	You can't just deny your political opponents however disgusting and morally reprehensible
1129400	1132280	they might be the basic rights that everyone should have.
1132280	1135220	Doesn't matter if they're Nazis, doesn't matter if they're turfs, doesn't matter if they're
1135220	1139880	socialists, doesn't matter if they're if they're groomers or pedophiles, doesn't matter.
1139880	1144780	There are still standards even for people you hate, especially for people you hate.
1144780	1149280	Even if they were in power they wouldn't give you that benefit and if you do away with those
1149280	1153120	standards you are at risk of becoming exactly like them.
1153120	1158480	If you truly are a member of the better side then that comes with acting like it.
