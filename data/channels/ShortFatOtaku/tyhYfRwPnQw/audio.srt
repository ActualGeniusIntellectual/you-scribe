00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,140
Hello my friends, the title of this video should be self-explanatory, but in case you

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,960
don't get it, this is just going to be a brief primer on how I research things.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,280
Because I don't necessarily want you to think like me whenever I make videos or I

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,640
do streams, but I do want you to at least learn the processes by which I come to the

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,260
conclusions that I come to.

6
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:27,700
Because in my opinion, finding the truth is more important than any sort of political

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,700
expediency.

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,780
Neither the left nor the right, no political camp, no ideological camp, no religion, nothing

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,620
has a monopoly on what the truth is.

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,780
Lots of people say that they do.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,420
If they say my view is always correct, my tribe knows what the truth is all the time,

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,700
they're trying to sell you something, whether it's the far left, far right, doesn't matter.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,340
So I just want to take two examples from either side of the aisle and just show you how to

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,220
really get the truth out of them.

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,220
Here's the first one.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,500
This one I actually did live on the weekly sip a few weeks back, but I figured I'd just

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,200
do it again just to show you my thought processes on when I try to find what the truth is.

18
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,560
So this is from Vice News.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,540
Far right extremists are threatening to execute doctors at a children's hospital.

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,300
The viral Twitter account Lives of TikTok promoted a lie about gender affirming care

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,820
at the hospital and now doctors are getting death threats.

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,820
Well, okay.

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,140
So let's see what the claim is.

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,420
Boston Children's Hospital said on Tuesday that its staff has faced a flood of violent

25
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,760
threats and harassment sparked by a false claim made by the viral Lives of TikTok account.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,640
The account tweeted on August 11th that Boston's Children's Hospital is now offering gender

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,200
affirming hysterectomies for young girls.

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,160
The claim has been widely debunked by fact-checking groups, but as is typical in anti-trans rhetoric,

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,380
facts rarely matter and the claims were shared widely on right-wing social media accounts.

30
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,160
As a result, the hospital and its staff have faced a torrent of abuse.

31
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:49,520
They've received hostile internet activity, phone calls, harassing emails, including threats

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,360
of violence towards clinicians and staff.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,500
And then the article gets into the various death threats and threats of assault made

34
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
by people on the internet.

35
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,660
On the one hand, I get it.

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,660
You shouldn't be getting those.

37
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,880
And the other hand is just the internet.

38
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,720
It's like cyberbullying ain't real.

39
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
Turn it off.

40
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,380
You know the quote at this point, but let's actually see what the truth is because this

41
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,960
article at this point focuses only on the fallout, but what's the truth of the claim?

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,680
Is it true that Boston Children's Hospital is now offering gender affirming hysterectomies

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,200
for young girls?

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,680
Now the claim has been widely debunked by fact-checking groups.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's see those fact-checkers.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,640
Yeah, there's a political fact saying false, but I mean, PolitiFact, they're kind of biased

47
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
as it is.

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,440
There's always the memes, oh, it's been debunked.

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,700
And then you look at the debunking and it's just like fucking stupid.

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,140
So we don't necessarily need to trust this.

51
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,560
This is at least one data point, but it's not the whole truth.

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,160
So let's actually look at it ourselves.

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,020
The first thing that I would do when trying to find the truth of a claim like this is

54
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,840
to look at the quote itself.

55
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,200
Let's find the original tweet.

56
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,800
Oh, at this point, libs of TikTok might actually be taken down.

57
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Nope.

58
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
It's still there.

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
And the tweet is actually right here.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,920
Boston Children's Hospital is now offering gender-affirming hysterectomies for young

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
girls.

62
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,640
So let's watch this video and see what's actually going on here, okay?

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,800
Gender-affirming hysterectomy is very similar to most hysterectomies that occur.

64
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,520
Hysterectomy itself is the removal of the uterus, the cervix, which is the opening of

65
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,980
the uterus, and the fallopian tubes, which are attached to the sides of the uterus.

66
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,640
Some gender-affirming hysterectomies will also include the removal of the ovaries, but

67
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,200
that's technically a separate procedure called a bilateral oophrectomy.

68
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,480
Not every gender-affirming hysterectomy includes that, and people who are getting gender-affirming

69
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,120
hysterectomies do not have to have their ovaries removed.

70
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,980
Okay, so that video didn't actually say what libs of TikTok said that it did.

71
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,640
That was a video describing what a gender-affirming hysterectomy is, but said nothing about young

72
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
girls.

73
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,740
Maybe they're making a jump in logic here, because the video did come from the Boston

74
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,980
Children's Hospital, and you know, that is a point, but let's continue to dig and see

75
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,260
what's actually going on.

76
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,740
Special report, Boston Children's Hospital boasts a full suite of surgical options for

77
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,040
transgender teens, has 90 videos promoting surgeries to youth on their YouTube page.

78
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,540
Co-director allows vaginoplasty on 17-year-olds, but hints at even younger.

79
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,420
Okay, let's see what this is all about.

80
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,620
So when I see this sentence, I really want to know where the hints at even younger comes

81
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
from.

82
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,620
Where's the source of this stuff?

83
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,520
We have to look this up, so let's head in.

84
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,020
Boston Children's Hospital gleefully encourages surgical, pharmaceutical, gender transition

85
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,060
for teens.

86
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,340
Dr. Oren Gennor, co-director of the Boston Children's Center for Gender Surgery, said

87
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,860
in an email to WBUR that he was slightly flexible when it comes to the age of males seeking

88
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,860
at genital surgery.

89
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,180
This is a video series.

90
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,500
This is their YouTube channel.

91
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,980
Oh, they deleted the playlist.

92
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,660
Yep, here's the channel.

93
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,640
Not much engagement on these videos, but I mean, that's fine.

94
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,420
They're here for, they're not here to be YouTubers.

95
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,760
I'm not sure if these are, you know, promoted to children.

96
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,620
They seem to be like straightforward videos on information.

97
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,140
Boston Children's Hospital founded the Gender Multispecialty Service Program in 2007 and

98
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,460
welcomes patients as young as three years old.

99
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,460
That sounds kind of crazy.

100
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,280
I assume they're not doing surgeries on people three years old.

101
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,380
At GEMS, our mission is to assess and care for gender diverse children, teens, and young

102
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,380
adults.

103
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,940
Young adults makes me think that it's not just children going to the children's hospital,

104
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,380
that it's over eight teens.

105
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,140
GEMS provides a variety of options for medical transition that include prescribing puberty

106
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,180
blockers, testosterone, estrogen, plastic surgery in their surgery center.

107
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,300
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

108
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,420
For children nine and under, the hospital helps facilitate a social transition that

109
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,220
prepares them for individualized treatment plans that can include puberty blockers, cross

110
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,380
sex hormones, and chest surgeries.

111
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,340
Chest surgeries are available at age 15.

112
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,620
Well, okay, there's one thing that I disagree with right off the bat.

113
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,100
Surgery should be coming at 18, not 15.

114
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,880
So I disagree with this, but we still haven't reached Libs of TikTok's claim yet that hysterectomies

115
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,100
are being offered to young girls.

116
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,900
Genital surgeries require several letters of support from the patient's healthcare providers

117
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,940
and must have lived as their identified gender for only 12 months.

118
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,620
For phalloplasty and metoidoplasty, they ask that you be at least 18 years old.

119
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,900
18 seems reasonable.

120
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,980
At that point, you're an adult.

121
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,180
You do what you want with your body.

122
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,460
Patients only 17 years old can obtain a vaginoplasty, but Dr. Oren Gennor, co-director of Boston

123
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,020
Children's Center for the Dead, hinted in an email that children even younger can be

124
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,020
operated on.

125
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,340
Gennor said in an email that he is slightly flexible when it comes to the age of males

126
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,540
seeking genital surgery.

127
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,420
He adds that the policy has not been finalized because of the issue around consent for sterilization,

128
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,860
which is a part of the procedure.

129
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,380
Let's see the standards of care model they're talking about.

130
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,380
Professional Association for Transgender Health.

131
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,380
Oh, this is a big ass document.

132
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,620
We've got to look at this, don't we?

133
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,620
Fuck.

134
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,620
English version 2012, loading in.

135
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,740
Can we just search for 18?

136
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,740
Pass page 18.

137
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,740
Surgery, maybe?

138
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,740
Surgery, page 54.

139
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:42,740
Active health, voice therapy, surgery.

140
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,780
Area for breast or chest surgery, creation of a male chest and FTM patients, persistent

141
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,860
well-documented gender dysphoria, capacity to make fully informed decision into consent,

142
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,820
age of majority in the given country.

143
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,680
If significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well-controlled.

144
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,780
Breast augmentation and MTF, same things.

145
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,660
Persistent well-documented gender dysphoria, capacity to make an informed decision, age

146
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,000
of majority, and these all seem to be the same.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
They all say age of majority in a given country.

148
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,000
So if we were to go back, when we have chest surgeries available at the age of 15, that's

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
bad.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,160
It's not what Libs of TikTok talks about in that tweet, but it is bad.

151
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,800
And patients 17 years old can obtain a vaginoplasty.

152
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
That's also bad.

153
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,200
It has to be 18 across the board.

154
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,920
And when he says he is slightly flexible, this is a serious problem.

155
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,320
So there's a lot of things happening right now at this Boston Children's Hospital that

156
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
I disagree with.

157
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,220
And in fact, the standard of care also disagrees with this stuff.

158
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,420
But the original claim was not about chest surgeries at 15 or puberty blockers at nine,

159
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,020
vaginoplasty is at 17.

160
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,000
The original claim was gender affirming hysterectomies for young girls.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,620
There does not seem to be any proof of that.

162
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,260
There's proof of other wrongdoing.

163
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,340
And if Libs of TikTok wanted to be factually correct, they could have reported on that

164
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,480
wrongdoing, but they didn't.

165
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,340
They chose to say gender affirming hysterectomies for young girls, which does not seem to be

166
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,340
the truth.

167
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,260
Now, the final point is that, oh, it's a children's hospital.

168
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,500
Well, of course, if they're going after kids, it's not adults getting it there, dude.

169
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,060
I saw people in the weekly sip chat actually say that quite a bit.

170
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,900
The only thing I have to say to that is that a while ago, the Boston Children's Hospital

171
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:23,380
extended the age range from 18 to 21, saying that's a little help for those college years.

172
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,300
Even though it is a children's hospital, it still has no problem treating young adults

173
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,660
from 18 to 21 and sometimes even treats full adults that need certain types of care.

174
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,380
Despite the chest surgeries at 15, despite the vaginoplasty at 17, both of which are

175
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,560
really bad things, this specific claim, gender affirming hysterectomies for young girls seems

176
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,140
to be false, or at the very least, they can't prove it.

177
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,580
Now, for example, if this tweet read, Boston Children's Hospital is offering gender affirming

178
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:57,620
vaginoplasty for young boys, that's actually a more accurate tweet, as we saw the policy

179
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,860
is 17, but that one doctor is willing to bend the rules on it.

180
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,900
So in that case, it wouldn't be a false claim.

181
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,460
But this claim is false.

182
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,720
Now at this point, I already hear your objection.

183
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,220
What does it matter if this claim is false?

184
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,660
Because the hospital is still bad, yes, but we have to be accurate.

185
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,700
We can't just go into this all willy nilly and just say whatever because there's some

186
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
bad stuff happening.

187
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,860
No, you can't be them.

188
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,940
You have to be accurate.

189
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,180
If I can dismantle this tweet through some simple Google searches, libs of TikTok looks

190
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,300
like a fucking moron, and now their credibility is shot, so if they come back with, say, something

191
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,740
that's actually real, who knows if it's true?

192
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,060
And while this is an example that kind of needles the right a little bit, I have an

193
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,640
equivalent example that kind of needles the left.

194
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,780
Here's something that Lilith sent me, and she was like, oh my God, they're finally doing

195
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,780
it.

196
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
They're finally coming for us.

197
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,780
Well, let's look at this claim too.

198
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,620
Approximately 9,000 transgender Floridians woke up today to find out they no longer have

199
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,460
life saving Medicaid coverage.

200
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,840
DeSantis bypassed the legislature and weaponized state agencies against his own constituents

201
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,800
for simply minding their own business.

202
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,100
This is not freedom.

203
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,260
Just like in the previous case, let's not take anyone's word for it.

204
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,900
Let's investigate this claim, because clearly this guy isn't exactly a neutral source.

205
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,740
He's Florida's first LGBTQ Latino legislature.

206
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,220
There are some articles on this change, discriminatory DeSantis administration regulation eliminating

207
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,560
Medicaid coverage for 9,000 plus transgender Floridians take effect this weekend.

208
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,540
This weekend on August 21st, Florida's agency for the healthcare administration shamelessly

209
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,620
executing the DeSantis administration's discriminatory agenda will rip away access to life-setting

210
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,700
Medicare for more than 9,000 transgender Floridians.

211
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,180
I hope this isn't just like the meme, like the over 9,000.

212
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,860
I hope it's not just that, okay?

213
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,020
What's the deal here?

214
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,980
Where does this number come from and where did this come from?

215
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,820
Well, it turns out that this tweet, while at least somewhat accurate, is written in

216
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,420
the most inflammatory possible way.

217
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,380
DeSantis bypassed the legislature.

218
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,740
Well, Florida's agency for healthcare administration is an organization under the purview of the

219
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
governor.

220
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
The legislature has no place in this process.

221
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,900
It's not bypassing the legislature if he's doing what the powers of his office allows

222
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
him to do.

223
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,260
Secondly, 9,000 transgender Floridians woke up today to find out they no longer have life-setting

224
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
coverage.

225
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
This implies that it just happened overnight.

226
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
It's like, what the fuck?

227
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
I woke up in this.

228
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
No, no, no, no, no.

229
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,260
This happened back on August 5th.

230
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,100
Florida medical board moves to block gender affirming treatments for minors.

231
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,620
The board also voted to start the process of requiring adults seeking such care to wait

232
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,900
24 hours for going forward with any medical procedures.

233
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,340
This was not something that came out of nowhere.

234
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,580
People woke up to him and was like, oh my God, it just happened.

235
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,580
No, no, no, no.

236
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,580
People have known this has been coming for weeks.

237
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,580
The medical board was following guidance from the Florida department of health, which

238
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,680
has claimed that there's not enough research.

239
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,260
So let's see what this guidance was.

240
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,260
404 not found.

241
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,260
It's gone.

242
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,260
That's okay.

243
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,260
I have a copy of it here.

244
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,800
This was published on June 2nd, 2022 for the board of medicine members of the board.

245
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,220
On April 20th, 2022, the Florida department of health released guidance in the treatment

246
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,220
for you.

247
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,300
So as the state, certain general, I recommend against certain pharmaceutical, non-pharmaceutical

248
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,620
and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria recommendations are based on a lack of conclusive

249
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,420
evidence and the high risk for long-term irreversible harms.

250
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,860
The overview conducted by Dr. Brindarnello Peterson, okay.

251
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,900
And Dr. Weircock, what the fuck are these names, dude?

252
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,300
The research where the doctors state that there is great uncertainty about the effects

253
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,600
of puberty blockers, cross sex hormones, and surgeries in young people with gender dysphoria.

254
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
So young people does not necessarily mean adults.

255
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,580
So I don't know where the 9,000 adults number comes from.

256
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,500
I don't necessarily agree with what's in this message, but this is guidance on what the

257
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,420
state should do, not necessarily where that 9,000, where does that 9,000 number come from

258
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,420
when he says 9,000 transgender Floridians.

259
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,100
The actual agency we're talking about doesn't have anything, no news post or anything related

260
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,080
to this change that apparently went into effect.

261
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,520
Why it's happening on the day that they say it's happening.

262
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,020
Why it's 9,000 transgender people.

263
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,100
There's no source for that.

264
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,400
Whenever an article like this one from the 19th to the 21st talks about it, all of their

265
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,180
sources end up leading back to the same date.

266
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,620
A series of articles published on August 5th.

267
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,540
However, those articles all refer to minors, not adults.

268
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:59,220
This implies that it's just people, not children, but just general people of age.

269
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,620
We have to find the source of this 9,000 number.

270
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,020
It's not appearing anywhere, anywhere I look.

271
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,900
And I think I might have it.

272
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,380
This is from the Williams Institute from 2019, Medicaid coverage for gender affirming care.

273
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,420
Let's do a control F for 9,000.

274
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,220
Nothing.

275
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,460
How about 9,000 with a comma?

276
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,460
Fewer than half.

277
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,460
Okay, that's just 69,000.

278
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,540
Oh, here we go.

279
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,700
There's a 9,000 entry for Florida under this table.

280
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,500
Table one, Medicaid enrollment of transgender adults by state.

281
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,020
Okay, so let's see here.

282
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:39,660
So for example, Alaska has 2,700 transgender adults and 1,000 of those adults are enrolled

283
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,780
in Medicaid and their gender affirming care is not covered by Medicaid or less than 1,000

284
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,780
adults.

285
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:52,380
There's 8450 transgender adults, 1,000 are enrolled in Medicaid and those 1,000 don't

286
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,380
have their care covered.

287
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,380
Okay.

288
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:00,100
In California, there's 218,000 transgender adults and 16,000 of them are on Medicaid

289
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,740
and their gender affirming care is covered.

290
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,060
Okay, that's what this is.

291
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:10,780
This third column, Florida has 100,000 transgender adults, 9,000 of those adults are on Medicaid

292
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,260
and Medicaid in Florida has no policy on gender affirming care.

293
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,000
So I guess in that case, it's just up to the individual doctor.

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,280
Maybe they approve it, maybe they don't.

295
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,500
For around 51,000 transgender Medicaid beneficiaries, coverage is uncertain because they live in

296
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,660
states where the laws are silent on Medicare coverage for gender affirming care.

297
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,640
The law doesn't say anything guaranteeing it or denying it.

298
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,660
So it's just going to be based on whatever the doctor thinks you need.

299
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,500
So that seems to be where the 9,000 number comes from is this table.

300
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,540
Now here's what I don't understand.

301
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,020
Whenever you have an article like this that says that the rules are changing for Medicaid

302
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:51,220
coverage, all of the sources eventually lead back to other articles that talk about minors,

303
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,220
not adults.

304
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:58,520
But this 9,000 figure comes from this collection of data that is specifically about adults.

305
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,500
So there seems to be two true statements here.

306
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,140
The first one is that 9,000 trans adults in Florida are on Medicaid and that the state

307
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,460
does not explicitly confirm or deny access to care through Medicaid.

308
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,460
That's a true statement.

309
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:17,260
The second true statement is that the rules regarding transitioning for children are changing

310
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,260
right now.

311
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,020
It seems to be the case that people are taking these two independent true statements and

312
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:29,760
mashing them together saying that those 9,000 transgender adults in Florida who are on Medicaid

313
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,740
coverage are somehow going to be affected by the rule change even though the rule change,

314
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,980
at least as far as I can tell, only seems to apply to children.

315
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,120
So how did this mess up happen?

316
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,320
How is it that this guy only read the headline to this article and then didn't look into

317
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,880
it and find out where this number comes from or go through the sources provided in the

318
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,620
article to get back to the source where it's only about minors?

319
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,760
How did this fuck up happen?

320
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,240
Well the answer to that can be found in this Politico article.

321
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,200
Simone Tris, director of the Southern Legal Council Transgender Rights Initiative said

322
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,400
on Wednesday that the coalition is expecting to file the case in federal court and will

323
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,100
seek a preliminary injunction to halt the ban from going forward.

324
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,180
So this is some kind of advocacy group that is going ahead and filing lawsuits against

325
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,780
the rule change that DeSantis wants to implement.

326
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,600
Simone Tris, remember the lawyer for this advocacy group says that Florida's ban will

327
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,780
affect up to 9,000 of the state's Medicaid enrollees who are transgender.

328
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,620
Florida joins either states that have already banned Medicaid dollars from going to gender

329
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,620
affirming care.

330
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,620
Okay, okay, okay.

331
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,100
So the first person to bring up the number 9,000 in the context of this conversation

332
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,840
is the lawyer for the advocacy group that is looking to stop the rule change.

333
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,580
Now presumably she got the number from this data set, so it's not like it's just a made

334
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,320
up number, it is an accurate number.

335
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,520
But this is why the lawyer said that the ban will affect up to 9,000.

336
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,760
So here's what's actually happening.

337
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,940
This person just directly said that approximately 9,000 transgender Floridians woke up today

338
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,580
to find out they no longer have life saving Medicaid coverage.

339
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:03,780
The 9,000 number comes from a data set regarding adults and the rule change seems to be affecting

340
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,060
predominantly children.

341
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,420
And the reason that these two were mushed together to appear to be part of the same

342
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:15,760
thing is because a lawyer for an advocacy group said up to 9,000 people may be affected

343
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,760
by this change.

344
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,500
That's a far cry from 9,000 people just woke up and found their rights eviscerated

345
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,500
by the state.

346
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,160
This number's use is from a lawyer who is making their case.

347
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,980
We expect them to put their best foot forward just like we expect their opponents to also

348
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,700
put their best foot forward and then let the judge hash it out in court.

349
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,620
Now I'm not sure if this change is actually good but you can see how every step of the

350
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,580
way the real information twists a little bit more and a little bit more until it starts

351
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,140
to sound like those scenes from V for Vendetta where the police are busting into people's

352
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,060
homes and dragging them away for just living a private life where they might be a deviant

353
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,060
or something.

354
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,380
It doesn't matter if you're left wing, right wing listening to this video.

355
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,800
If you are partisan you probably looked at the part of the video that makes your side

356
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,280
look good and you're like yeah of course this is really good, good digging dev you

357
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,720
did it and then you're looking at the part of the video that makes your side look bad

358
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,080
and you're like well you're just stretching the truth or you're just being partisan or

359
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,060
you just don't understand or you can't you know this is me doing my best to research

360
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,940
the topics as good faith as I can.

361
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,160
Now I could be wrong.

362
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,280
I'm not coming into it to make either the pro-trans or the anti-trans lobby look good

363
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,280
or bad.

364
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,040
I want to know what the truth is and the reason that I feel this strongly about it is because

365
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,480
there has to be some kind of standard, there has to be some kind of neutral territory in

366
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,120
which we can come together even though we believe different things and hash out the

367
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,880
agreement that allows us to live together in peace.

368
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,760
You can't simply destroy the overarching superstructure that you use to negotiate with each other

369
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,360
in the name of political expediency.

370
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,400
You can't just deny your political opponents however disgusting and morally reprehensible

371
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,280
they might be the basic rights that everyone should have.

372
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,220
Doesn't matter if they're Nazis, doesn't matter if they're turfs, doesn't matter if they're

373
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,880
socialists, doesn't matter if they're if they're groomers or pedophiles, doesn't matter.

374
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,780
There are still standards even for people you hate, especially for people you hate.

375
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:09,280
Even if they were in power they wouldn't give you that benefit and if you do away with those

376
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,120
standards you are at risk of becoming exactly like them.

377
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,480
If you truly are a member of the better side then that comes with acting like it.
