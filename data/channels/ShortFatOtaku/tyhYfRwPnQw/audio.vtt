00:00.000 --> 00:09.140
Hello my friends, the title of this video should be self-explanatory, but in case you

00:09.140 --> 00:13.960
don't get it, this is just going to be a brief primer on how I research things.

00:13.960 --> 00:17.280
Because I don't necessarily want you to think like me whenever I make videos or I

00:17.280 --> 00:21.640
do streams, but I do want you to at least learn the processes by which I come to the

00:21.640 --> 00:23.260
conclusions that I come to.

00:23.260 --> 00:27.700
Because in my opinion, finding the truth is more important than any sort of political

00:27.700 --> 00:28.700
expediency.

00:28.700 --> 00:32.780
Neither the left nor the right, no political camp, no ideological camp, no religion, nothing

00:32.780 --> 00:35.620
has a monopoly on what the truth is.

00:35.620 --> 00:36.780
Lots of people say that they do.

00:36.780 --> 00:42.420
If they say my view is always correct, my tribe knows what the truth is all the time,

00:42.420 --> 00:45.700
they're trying to sell you something, whether it's the far left, far right, doesn't matter.

00:45.700 --> 00:50.340
So I just want to take two examples from either side of the aisle and just show you how to

00:50.340 --> 00:52.220
really get the truth out of them.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.220
Here's the first one.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.500
This one I actually did live on the weekly sip a few weeks back, but I figured I'd just

00:56.500 --> 01:01.200
do it again just to show you my thought processes on when I try to find what the truth is.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.560
So this is from Vice News.

01:02.560 --> 01:06.540
Far right extremists are threatening to execute doctors at a children's hospital.

01:06.540 --> 01:10.300
The viral Twitter account Lives of TikTok promoted a lie about gender affirming care

01:10.300 --> 01:12.820
at the hospital and now doctors are getting death threats.

01:12.820 --> 01:13.820
Well, okay.

01:13.820 --> 01:15.140
So let's see what the claim is.

01:15.140 --> 01:19.420
Boston Children's Hospital said on Tuesday that its staff has faced a flood of violent

01:19.420 --> 01:24.760
threats and harassment sparked by a false claim made by the viral Lives of TikTok account.

01:24.760 --> 01:29.640
The account tweeted on August 11th that Boston's Children's Hospital is now offering gender

01:29.640 --> 01:32.200
affirming hysterectomies for young girls.

01:32.200 --> 01:38.160
The claim has been widely debunked by fact-checking groups, but as is typical in anti-trans rhetoric,

01:38.160 --> 01:42.380
facts rarely matter and the claims were shared widely on right-wing social media accounts.

01:42.380 --> 01:45.160
As a result, the hospital and its staff have faced a torrent of abuse.

01:45.160 --> 01:49.520
They've received hostile internet activity, phone calls, harassing emails, including threats

01:49.520 --> 01:51.360
of violence towards clinicians and staff.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.500
And then the article gets into the various death threats and threats of assault made

01:55.500 --> 01:56.500
by people on the internet.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.660
On the one hand, I get it.

01:57.660 --> 01:58.660
You shouldn't be getting those.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.880
And the other hand is just the internet.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.720
It's like cyberbullying ain't real.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.720
Turn it off.

02:02.720 --> 02:06.380
You know the quote at this point, but let's actually see what the truth is because this

02:06.380 --> 02:10.960
article at this point focuses only on the fallout, but what's the truth of the claim?

02:10.960 --> 02:16.680
Is it true that Boston Children's Hospital is now offering gender affirming hysterectomies

02:16.680 --> 02:18.200
for young girls?

02:18.200 --> 02:20.680
Now the claim has been widely debunked by fact-checking groups.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Let's see those fact-checkers.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.640
Yeah, there's a political fact saying false, but I mean, PolitiFact, they're kind of biased

02:25.640 --> 02:26.640
as it is.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.440
There's always the memes, oh, it's been debunked.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.700
And then you look at the debunking and it's just like fucking stupid.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.140
So we don't necessarily need to trust this.

02:33.140 --> 02:35.560
This is at least one data point, but it's not the whole truth.

02:35.560 --> 02:37.160
So let's actually look at it ourselves.

02:37.160 --> 02:41.020
The first thing that I would do when trying to find the truth of a claim like this is

02:41.020 --> 02:42.840
to look at the quote itself.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.200
Let's find the original tweet.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.800
Oh, at this point, libs of TikTok might actually be taken down.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.800
Nope.

02:47.800 --> 02:48.800
It's still there.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.000
And the tweet is actually right here.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.920
Boston Children's Hospital is now offering gender-affirming hysterectomies for young

02:53.920 --> 02:54.920
girls.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.640
So let's watch this video and see what's actually going on here, okay?

02:58.640 --> 03:03.800
Gender-affirming hysterectomy is very similar to most hysterectomies that occur.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.520
Hysterectomy itself is the removal of the uterus, the cervix, which is the opening of

03:07.520 --> 03:11.980
the uterus, and the fallopian tubes, which are attached to the sides of the uterus.

03:11.980 --> 03:15.640
Some gender-affirming hysterectomies will also include the removal of the ovaries, but

03:15.640 --> 03:19.200
that's technically a separate procedure called a bilateral oophrectomy.

03:19.480 --> 03:23.480
Not every gender-affirming hysterectomy includes that, and people who are getting gender-affirming

03:23.480 --> 03:26.120
hysterectomies do not have to have their ovaries removed.

03:29.120 --> 03:34.980
Okay, so that video didn't actually say what libs of TikTok said that it did.

03:34.980 --> 03:39.640
That was a video describing what a gender-affirming hysterectomy is, but said nothing about young

03:39.640 --> 03:40.640
girls.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.740
Maybe they're making a jump in logic here, because the video did come from the Boston

03:43.740 --> 03:47.980
Children's Hospital, and you know, that is a point, but let's continue to dig and see

03:48.260 --> 03:49.260
what's actually going on.

03:49.260 --> 03:52.740
Special report, Boston Children's Hospital boasts a full suite of surgical options for

03:52.740 --> 03:57.040
transgender teens, has 90 videos promoting surgeries to youth on their YouTube page.

03:57.040 --> 04:02.540
Co-director allows vaginoplasty on 17-year-olds, but hints at even younger.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.420
Okay, let's see what this is all about.

04:04.420 --> 04:08.620
So when I see this sentence, I really want to know where the hints at even younger comes

04:08.620 --> 04:09.620
from.

04:09.620 --> 04:10.620
Where's the source of this stuff?

04:10.620 --> 04:12.520
We have to look this up, so let's head in.

04:12.520 --> 04:17.020
Boston Children's Hospital gleefully encourages surgical, pharmaceutical, gender transition

04:17.060 --> 04:18.060
for teens.

04:18.060 --> 04:22.340
Dr. Oren Gennor, co-director of the Boston Children's Center for Gender Surgery, said

04:22.340 --> 04:27.860
in an email to WBUR that he was slightly flexible when it comes to the age of males seeking

04:27.860 --> 04:28.860
at genital surgery.

04:28.860 --> 04:30.180
This is a video series.

04:30.180 --> 04:32.500
This is their YouTube channel.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.980
Oh, they deleted the playlist.

04:34.980 --> 04:36.660
Yep, here's the channel.

04:36.660 --> 04:39.640
Not much engagement on these videos, but I mean, that's fine.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.420
They're here for, they're not here to be YouTubers.

04:41.420 --> 04:43.760
I'm not sure if these are, you know, promoted to children.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.620
They seem to be like straightforward videos on information.

04:47.220 --> 04:52.140
Boston Children's Hospital founded the Gender Multispecialty Service Program in 2007 and

04:52.140 --> 04:54.460
welcomes patients as young as three years old.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.460
That sounds kind of crazy.

04:55.460 --> 04:58.280
I assume they're not doing surgeries on people three years old.

04:58.280 --> 05:02.380
At GEMS, our mission is to assess and care for gender diverse children, teens, and young

05:02.380 --> 05:03.380
adults.

05:03.380 --> 05:06.940
Young adults makes me think that it's not just children going to the children's hospital,

05:06.940 --> 05:08.380
that it's over eight teens.

05:08.380 --> 05:12.140
GEMS provides a variety of options for medical transition that include prescribing puberty

05:12.140 --> 05:15.180
blockers, testosterone, estrogen, plastic surgery in their surgery center.

05:15.180 --> 05:16.300
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

05:16.300 --> 05:19.420
For children nine and under, the hospital helps facilitate a social transition that

05:19.420 --> 05:23.220
prepares them for individualized treatment plans that can include puberty blockers, cross

05:23.220 --> 05:25.380
sex hormones, and chest surgeries.

05:25.380 --> 05:27.340
Chest surgeries are available at age 15.

05:27.340 --> 05:30.620
Well, okay, there's one thing that I disagree with right off the bat.

05:30.620 --> 05:33.100
Surgery should be coming at 18, not 15.

05:33.100 --> 05:38.880
So I disagree with this, but we still haven't reached Libs of TikTok's claim yet that hysterectomies

05:38.880 --> 05:41.100
are being offered to young girls.

05:41.100 --> 05:45.900
Genital surgeries require several letters of support from the patient's healthcare providers

05:45.900 --> 05:49.940
and must have lived as their identified gender for only 12 months.

05:49.940 --> 05:55.620
For phalloplasty and metoidoplasty, they ask that you be at least 18 years old.

05:55.620 --> 05:56.900
18 seems reasonable.

05:56.900 --> 05:57.980
At that point, you're an adult.

05:57.980 --> 05:59.180
You do what you want with your body.

05:59.180 --> 06:04.460
Patients only 17 years old can obtain a vaginoplasty, but Dr. Oren Gennor, co-director of Boston

06:04.460 --> 06:08.020
Children's Center for the Dead, hinted in an email that children even younger can be

06:08.020 --> 06:09.020
operated on.

06:09.020 --> 06:12.340
Gennor said in an email that he is slightly flexible when it comes to the age of males

06:12.340 --> 06:13.540
seeking genital surgery.

06:13.540 --> 06:17.420
He adds that the policy has not been finalized because of the issue around consent for sterilization,

06:17.420 --> 06:18.860
which is a part of the procedure.

06:18.860 --> 06:21.380
Let's see the standards of care model they're talking about.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.380
Professional Association for Transgender Health.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.380
Oh, this is a big ass document.

06:25.380 --> 06:27.620
We've got to look at this, don't we?

06:27.620 --> 06:28.620
Fuck.

06:28.620 --> 06:29.620
English version 2012, loading in.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.740
Can we just search for 18?

06:32.740 --> 06:33.740
Pass page 18.

06:33.740 --> 06:34.740
Surgery, maybe?

06:34.740 --> 06:35.740
Surgery, page 54.

06:35.740 --> 06:42.740
Active health, voice therapy, surgery.

06:42.740 --> 06:47.780
Area for breast or chest surgery, creation of a male chest and FTM patients, persistent

06:47.780 --> 06:51.860
well-documented gender dysphoria, capacity to make fully informed decision into consent,

06:51.860 --> 06:53.820
age of majority in the given country.

06:53.820 --> 06:57.680
If significant medical or mental health concerns are present, they must be reasonably well-controlled.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.780
Breast augmentation and MTF, same things.

07:00.780 --> 07:03.660
Persistent well-documented gender dysphoria, capacity to make an informed decision, age

07:03.660 --> 07:06.000
of majority, and these all seem to be the same.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.280
They all say age of majority in a given country.

07:09.280 --> 07:14.000
So if we were to go back, when we have chest surgeries available at the age of 15, that's

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
bad.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.160
It's not what Libs of TikTok talks about in that tweet, but it is bad.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.800
And patients 17 years old can obtain a vaginoplasty.

07:21.800 --> 07:22.800
That's also bad.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.200
It has to be 18 across the board.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.920
And when he says he is slightly flexible, this is a serious problem.

07:27.920 --> 07:32.320
So there's a lot of things happening right now at this Boston Children's Hospital that

07:32.320 --> 07:33.320
I disagree with.

07:33.320 --> 07:37.220
And in fact, the standard of care also disagrees with this stuff.

07:37.220 --> 07:42.420
But the original claim was not about chest surgeries at 15 or puberty blockers at nine,

07:42.420 --> 07:44.020
vaginoplasty is at 17.

07:44.020 --> 07:49.000
The original claim was gender affirming hysterectomies for young girls.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.620
There does not seem to be any proof of that.

07:51.620 --> 07:53.260
There's proof of other wrongdoing.

07:53.260 --> 07:57.340
And if Libs of TikTok wanted to be factually correct, they could have reported on that

07:57.340 --> 07:58.480
wrongdoing, but they didn't.

07:58.480 --> 08:03.340
They chose to say gender affirming hysterectomies for young girls, which does not seem to be

08:03.340 --> 08:04.340
the truth.

08:04.340 --> 08:06.260
Now, the final point is that, oh, it's a children's hospital.

08:06.300 --> 08:09.500
Well, of course, if they're going after kids, it's not adults getting it there, dude.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.060
I saw people in the weekly sip chat actually say that quite a bit.

08:12.060 --> 08:16.900
The only thing I have to say to that is that a while ago, the Boston Children's Hospital

08:16.900 --> 08:23.380
extended the age range from 18 to 21, saying that's a little help for those college years.

08:23.380 --> 08:27.300
Even though it is a children's hospital, it still has no problem treating young adults

08:27.300 --> 08:32.660
from 18 to 21 and sometimes even treats full adults that need certain types of care.

08:32.660 --> 08:37.380
Despite the chest surgeries at 15, despite the vaginoplasty at 17, both of which are

08:37.380 --> 08:43.560
really bad things, this specific claim, gender affirming hysterectomies for young girls seems

08:43.560 --> 08:46.140
to be false, or at the very least, they can't prove it.

08:46.140 --> 08:51.580
Now, for example, if this tweet read, Boston Children's Hospital is offering gender affirming

08:51.580 --> 08:57.620
vaginoplasty for young boys, that's actually a more accurate tweet, as we saw the policy

08:57.620 --> 09:00.860
is 17, but that one doctor is willing to bend the rules on it.

09:00.860 --> 09:02.900
So in that case, it wouldn't be a false claim.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.460
But this claim is false.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.720
Now at this point, I already hear your objection.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.220
What does it matter if this claim is false?

09:08.220 --> 09:11.660
Because the hospital is still bad, yes, but we have to be accurate.

09:11.660 --> 09:15.700
We can't just go into this all willy nilly and just say whatever because there's some

09:15.700 --> 09:16.700
bad stuff happening.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.860
No, you can't be them.

09:18.860 --> 09:19.940
You have to be accurate.

09:19.940 --> 09:24.180
If I can dismantle this tweet through some simple Google searches, libs of TikTok looks

09:24.180 --> 09:28.300
like a fucking moron, and now their credibility is shot, so if they come back with, say, something

09:28.300 --> 09:30.740
that's actually real, who knows if it's true?

09:30.740 --> 09:34.060
And while this is an example that kind of needles the right a little bit, I have an

09:34.060 --> 09:36.640
equivalent example that kind of needles the left.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.780
Here's something that Lilith sent me, and she was like, oh my God, they're finally doing

09:39.780 --> 09:40.780
it.

09:40.780 --> 09:41.780
They're finally coming for us.

09:41.780 --> 09:42.780
Well, let's look at this claim too.

09:42.780 --> 09:47.620
Approximately 9,000 transgender Floridians woke up today to find out they no longer have

09:47.620 --> 09:49.460
life saving Medicaid coverage.

09:49.460 --> 09:54.840
DeSantis bypassed the legislature and weaponized state agencies against his own constituents

09:54.840 --> 09:56.800
for simply minding their own business.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.100
This is not freedom.

09:58.100 --> 10:01.260
Just like in the previous case, let's not take anyone's word for it.

10:01.260 --> 10:05.900
Let's investigate this claim, because clearly this guy isn't exactly a neutral source.

10:05.900 --> 10:08.740
He's Florida's first LGBTQ Latino legislature.

10:08.740 --> 10:13.220
There are some articles on this change, discriminatory DeSantis administration regulation eliminating

10:13.220 --> 10:17.560
Medicaid coverage for 9,000 plus transgender Floridians take effect this weekend.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.540
This weekend on August 21st, Florida's agency for the healthcare administration shamelessly

10:21.540 --> 10:25.620
executing the DeSantis administration's discriminatory agenda will rip away access to life-setting

10:25.620 --> 10:28.700
Medicare for more than 9,000 transgender Floridians.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.180
I hope this isn't just like the meme, like the over 9,000.

10:31.180 --> 10:32.860
I hope it's not just that, okay?

10:32.860 --> 10:34.020
What's the deal here?

10:34.020 --> 10:35.980
Where does this number come from and where did this come from?

10:35.980 --> 10:40.820
Well, it turns out that this tweet, while at least somewhat accurate, is written in

10:40.820 --> 10:43.420
the most inflammatory possible way.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.380
DeSantis bypassed the legislature.

10:45.380 --> 10:50.740
Well, Florida's agency for healthcare administration is an organization under the purview of the

10:50.740 --> 10:51.740
governor.

10:51.740 --> 10:53.740
The legislature has no place in this process.

10:53.740 --> 10:57.900
It's not bypassing the legislature if he's doing what the powers of his office allows

10:57.900 --> 10:58.900
him to do.

10:58.900 --> 11:03.260
Secondly, 9,000 transgender Floridians woke up today to find out they no longer have life-setting

11:03.260 --> 11:04.260
coverage.

11:04.260 --> 11:05.260
This implies that it just happened overnight.

11:05.260 --> 11:06.260
It's like, what the fuck?

11:06.260 --> 11:07.260
I woke up in this.

11:07.260 --> 11:08.260
No, no, no, no, no.

11:08.260 --> 11:09.260
This happened back on August 5th.

11:09.260 --> 11:12.100
Florida medical board moves to block gender affirming treatments for minors.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.620
The board also voted to start the process of requiring adults seeking such care to wait

11:14.620 --> 11:16.900
24 hours for going forward with any medical procedures.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.340
This was not something that came out of nowhere.

11:18.340 --> 11:20.580
People woke up to him and was like, oh my God, it just happened.

11:20.580 --> 11:21.580
No, no, no, no.

11:21.580 --> 11:22.580
People have known this has been coming for weeks.

11:22.580 --> 11:26.580
The medical board was following guidance from the Florida department of health, which

11:26.580 --> 11:28.680
has claimed that there's not enough research.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.260
So let's see what this guidance was.

11:30.260 --> 11:31.260
404 not found.

11:31.260 --> 11:32.260
It's gone.

11:32.260 --> 11:33.260
That's okay.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.260
I have a copy of it here.

11:34.260 --> 11:37.800
This was published on June 2nd, 2022 for the board of medicine members of the board.

11:37.800 --> 11:42.220
On April 20th, 2022, the Florida department of health released guidance in the treatment

11:42.220 --> 11:43.220
for you.

11:43.220 --> 11:46.300
So as the state, certain general, I recommend against certain pharmaceutical, non-pharmaceutical

11:46.300 --> 11:49.620
and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria recommendations are based on a lack of conclusive

11:49.620 --> 11:52.420
evidence and the high risk for long-term irreversible harms.

11:52.420 --> 11:57.860
The overview conducted by Dr. Brindarnello Peterson, okay.

11:57.860 --> 12:00.900
And Dr. Weircock, what the fuck are these names, dude?

12:00.900 --> 12:04.300
The research where the doctors state that there is great uncertainty about the effects

12:04.300 --> 12:09.600
of puberty blockers, cross sex hormones, and surgeries in young people with gender dysphoria.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.480
So young people does not necessarily mean adults.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.580
So I don't know where the 9,000 adults number comes from.

12:15.580 --> 12:19.500
I don't necessarily agree with what's in this message, but this is guidance on what the

12:19.500 --> 12:24.420
state should do, not necessarily where that 9,000, where does that 9,000 number come from

12:24.420 --> 12:27.420
when he says 9,000 transgender Floridians.

12:27.420 --> 12:32.100
The actual agency we're talking about doesn't have anything, no news post or anything related

12:32.100 --> 12:34.080
to this change that apparently went into effect.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.520
Why it's happening on the day that they say it's happening.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.020
Why it's 9,000 transgender people.

12:39.020 --> 12:40.100
There's no source for that.

12:40.100 --> 12:44.400
Whenever an article like this one from the 19th to the 21st talks about it, all of their

12:44.400 --> 12:47.180
sources end up leading back to the same date.

12:47.180 --> 12:49.620
A series of articles published on August 5th.

12:49.620 --> 12:53.540
However, those articles all refer to minors, not adults.

12:53.540 --> 12:59.220
This implies that it's just people, not children, but just general people of age.

12:59.220 --> 13:01.620
We have to find the source of this 9,000 number.

13:01.620 --> 13:04.020
It's not appearing anywhere, anywhere I look.

13:04.020 --> 13:05.900
And I think I might have it.

13:05.900 --> 13:11.380
This is from the Williams Institute from 2019, Medicaid coverage for gender affirming care.

13:11.380 --> 13:15.420
Let's do a control F for 9,000.

13:17.220 --> 13:18.220
Nothing.

13:18.220 --> 13:20.460
How about 9,000 with a comma?

13:20.460 --> 13:21.460
Fewer than half.

13:21.460 --> 13:22.460
Okay, that's just 69,000.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.540
Oh, here we go.

13:24.540 --> 13:27.700
There's a 9,000 entry for Florida under this table.

13:27.700 --> 13:30.500
Table one, Medicaid enrollment of transgender adults by state.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.020
Okay, so let's see here.

13:32.020 --> 13:39.660
So for example, Alaska has 2,700 transgender adults and 1,000 of those adults are enrolled

13:39.660 --> 13:44.780
in Medicaid and their gender affirming care is not covered by Medicaid or less than 1,000

13:44.780 --> 13:45.780
adults.

13:46.220 --> 13:52.380
There's 8450 transgender adults, 1,000 are enrolled in Medicaid and those 1,000 don't

13:52.380 --> 13:53.380
have their care covered.

13:53.380 --> 13:54.380
Okay.

13:54.380 --> 14:00.100
In California, there's 218,000 transgender adults and 16,000 of them are on Medicaid

14:00.100 --> 14:01.740
and their gender affirming care is covered.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.060
Okay, that's what this is.

14:03.060 --> 14:10.780
This third column, Florida has 100,000 transgender adults, 9,000 of those adults are on Medicaid

14:10.780 --> 14:15.260
and Medicaid in Florida has no policy on gender affirming care.

14:15.260 --> 14:19.000
So I guess in that case, it's just up to the individual doctor.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.280
Maybe they approve it, maybe they don't.

14:20.280 --> 14:25.500
For around 51,000 transgender Medicaid beneficiaries, coverage is uncertain because they live in

14:25.500 --> 14:29.660
states where the laws are silent on Medicare coverage for gender affirming care.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.640
The law doesn't say anything guaranteeing it or denying it.

14:32.640 --> 14:35.660
So it's just going to be based on whatever the doctor thinks you need.

14:35.660 --> 14:39.500
So that seems to be where the 9,000 number comes from is this table.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.540
Now here's what I don't understand.

14:40.540 --> 14:45.020
Whenever you have an article like this that says that the rules are changing for Medicaid

14:45.020 --> 14:51.220
coverage, all of the sources eventually lead back to other articles that talk about minors,

14:51.220 --> 14:52.220
not adults.

14:52.220 --> 14:58.520
But this 9,000 figure comes from this collection of data that is specifically about adults.

14:58.520 --> 15:01.500
So there seems to be two true statements here.

15:01.500 --> 15:07.140
The first one is that 9,000 trans adults in Florida are on Medicaid and that the state

15:07.140 --> 15:11.460
does not explicitly confirm or deny access to care through Medicaid.

15:11.460 --> 15:12.460
That's a true statement.

15:12.460 --> 15:17.260
The second true statement is that the rules regarding transitioning for children are changing

15:17.260 --> 15:18.260
right now.

15:18.260 --> 15:23.020
It seems to be the case that people are taking these two independent true statements and

15:23.020 --> 15:29.760
mashing them together saying that those 9,000 transgender adults in Florida who are on Medicaid

15:29.760 --> 15:34.740
coverage are somehow going to be affected by the rule change even though the rule change,

15:34.740 --> 15:37.980
at least as far as I can tell, only seems to apply to children.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.120
So how did this mess up happen?

15:40.120 --> 15:44.320
How is it that this guy only read the headline to this article and then didn't look into

15:44.320 --> 15:48.880
it and find out where this number comes from or go through the sources provided in the

15:48.880 --> 15:51.620
article to get back to the source where it's only about minors?

15:51.620 --> 15:52.760
How did this fuck up happen?

15:52.760 --> 15:56.240
Well the answer to that can be found in this Politico article.

15:56.240 --> 16:01.200
Simone Tris, director of the Southern Legal Council Transgender Rights Initiative said

16:01.200 --> 16:05.400
on Wednesday that the coalition is expecting to file the case in federal court and will

16:05.400 --> 16:08.100
seek a preliminary injunction to halt the ban from going forward.

16:08.100 --> 16:13.180
So this is some kind of advocacy group that is going ahead and filing lawsuits against

16:13.180 --> 16:15.780
the rule change that DeSantis wants to implement.

16:15.780 --> 16:19.600
Simone Tris, remember the lawyer for this advocacy group says that Florida's ban will

16:19.600 --> 16:24.780
affect up to 9,000 of the state's Medicaid enrollees who are transgender.

16:24.780 --> 16:27.620
Florida joins either states that have already banned Medicaid dollars from going to gender

16:27.620 --> 16:28.620
affirming care.

16:28.620 --> 16:29.620
Okay, okay, okay.

16:29.620 --> 16:34.100
So the first person to bring up the number 9,000 in the context of this conversation

16:34.100 --> 16:38.840
is the lawyer for the advocacy group that is looking to stop the rule change.

16:38.840 --> 16:42.580
Now presumably she got the number from this data set, so it's not like it's just a made

16:42.580 --> 16:44.320
up number, it is an accurate number.

16:44.320 --> 16:49.520
But this is why the lawyer said that the ban will affect up to 9,000.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.760
So here's what's actually happening.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.940
This person just directly said that approximately 9,000 transgender Floridians woke up today

16:54.940 --> 16:57.580
to find out they no longer have life saving Medicaid coverage.

16:57.580 --> 17:03.780
The 9,000 number comes from a data set regarding adults and the rule change seems to be affecting

17:03.780 --> 17:05.060
predominantly children.

17:05.060 --> 17:09.420
And the reason that these two were mushed together to appear to be part of the same

17:09.420 --> 17:15.760
thing is because a lawyer for an advocacy group said up to 9,000 people may be affected

17:15.760 --> 17:16.760
by this change.

17:16.760 --> 17:21.500
That's a far cry from 9,000 people just woke up and found their rights eviscerated

17:21.500 --> 17:22.500
by the state.

17:22.500 --> 17:26.160
This number's use is from a lawyer who is making their case.

17:26.160 --> 17:30.980
We expect them to put their best foot forward just like we expect their opponents to also

17:30.980 --> 17:34.700
put their best foot forward and then let the judge hash it out in court.

17:34.700 --> 17:38.620
Now I'm not sure if this change is actually good but you can see how every step of the

17:38.620 --> 17:42.580
way the real information twists a little bit more and a little bit more until it starts

17:42.580 --> 17:46.140
to sound like those scenes from V for Vendetta where the police are busting into people's

17:46.140 --> 17:50.060
homes and dragging them away for just living a private life where they might be a deviant

17:50.060 --> 17:51.060
or something.

17:51.060 --> 17:53.380
It doesn't matter if you're left wing, right wing listening to this video.

17:53.380 --> 17:57.800
If you are partisan you probably looked at the part of the video that makes your side

17:57.800 --> 18:01.280
look good and you're like yeah of course this is really good, good digging dev you

18:01.280 --> 18:03.720
did it and then you're looking at the part of the video that makes your side look bad

18:03.720 --> 18:07.080
and you're like well you're just stretching the truth or you're just being partisan or

18:07.080 --> 18:12.060
you just don't understand or you can't you know this is me doing my best to research

18:12.060 --> 18:13.940
the topics as good faith as I can.

18:13.940 --> 18:15.160
Now I could be wrong.

18:15.160 --> 18:20.280
I'm not coming into it to make either the pro-trans or the anti-trans lobby look good

18:20.280 --> 18:21.280
or bad.

18:21.280 --> 18:25.040
I want to know what the truth is and the reason that I feel this strongly about it is because

18:25.040 --> 18:29.480
there has to be some kind of standard, there has to be some kind of neutral territory in

18:29.480 --> 18:34.120
which we can come together even though we believe different things and hash out the

18:34.120 --> 18:36.880
agreement that allows us to live together in peace.

18:36.880 --> 18:42.760
You can't simply destroy the overarching superstructure that you use to negotiate with each other

18:42.760 --> 18:44.360
in the name of political expediency.

18:44.360 --> 18:49.400
You can't just deny your political opponents however disgusting and morally reprehensible

18:49.400 --> 18:52.280
they might be the basic rights that everyone should have.

18:52.280 --> 18:55.220
Doesn't matter if they're Nazis, doesn't matter if they're turfs, doesn't matter if they're

18:55.220 --> 18:59.880
socialists, doesn't matter if they're if they're groomers or pedophiles, doesn't matter.

18:59.880 --> 19:04.780
There are still standards even for people you hate, especially for people you hate.

19:04.780 --> 19:09.280
Even if they were in power they wouldn't give you that benefit and if you do away with those

19:09.280 --> 19:13.120
standards you are at risk of becoming exactly like them.

19:13.120 --> 19:18.480
If you truly are a member of the better side then that comes with acting like it.
