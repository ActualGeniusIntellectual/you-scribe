0	4080	Hey guys, no video today but that doesn't mean that I'm doing nothing. What I've been doing
4080	10000	today, and actually parts of last night, was finally formalizing the setup for the SFO
10000	15040	Bitchute channel. I'm kind of following Styx's lead, Styx Hexenhammer, I'm kind of following
15040	20800	his lead on this one. He is right about about alt tech, alternate platforms. I know that Gab
20800	24880	is kind of going in the shitter right now but that's just Gab. You know, Subscribestar still
24880	29360	going strong, Bitchute still going strong, and there's a few others that I'll probably at least
29360	35680	look into. But for now, I noticed that the SFO Bitchute channel has kind of been neglected
35680	41760	recently, and the autograbber hasn't been properly mirroring the videos. So I went back through my
41760	46960	backlog, I re-uploaded, you can see a bunch of old videos here, I re-uploaded a bunch of videos
46960	52400	that the grabber didn't get. I should have every single SFO video now on there, with the exception
52400	58560	of like some really old vlogs from like 2013 or something, they don't really matter. Feel free to
58560	63840	go through, let me know if any videos aren't working, let me know if any videos are missing,
63840	67440	just in case I happened to miss one, if you want to watch the backlog on Bitchute, it's there.
69040	74880	That is, by the way, Bitchute.com slash Sharp Feta Taku, like it has this this ID up here,
74880	81200	but I'm pretty sure if I just put in Sharp Feta Taku, it should work. Let's just see here,
82080	89280	yes it does, okay. So I spent pretty much today and yesterday going through my backlog, re-uploading
89280	93440	all the old videos, and now I'm going to start doing the same for my other alt channels,
94320	97840	Game Boomers and the Dev Kit. Game Boomers is going to be a huge project, but that's not a
97840	101040	big deal. The Dev Kit, meanwhile, is where I'm going to start putting stuff that's not,
101680	105680	it's not politics and it's not gaming, it's just like other, and I've kind of neglected that
105680	108720	channel for a while too, I'm going to start working on that, but basically this is what
108720	113280	I've been doing, please consider following me over on Bitchute, just because, frankly,
113280	117760	YouTube is a dumpster fire, and I'm sure at some point I'll be kicked off of it too,
117760	123440	so swing by Bitchute.com slash Sharp Feta Taku and consider supporting alt tech wherever you can,
123440	127520	and also try to get the other creators that you know, that you watch, that you love,
127520	131760	to migrate to alt tech too, because at some point YouTube is going to come for everyone that's not
131760	136320	mainstream media. Alright guys, I'll see you there. I love you.
