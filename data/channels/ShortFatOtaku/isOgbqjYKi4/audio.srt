00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Hey guys, no video today but that doesn't mean that I'm doing nothing. What I've been doing

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,000
today, and actually parts of last night, was finally formalizing the setup for the SFO

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,040
Bitchute channel. I'm kind of following Styx's lead, Styx Hexenhammer, I'm kind of following

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,800
his lead on this one. He is right about about alt tech, alternate platforms. I know that Gab

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,880
is kind of going in the shitter right now but that's just Gab. You know, Subscribestar still

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,360
going strong, Bitchute still going strong, and there's a few others that I'll probably at least

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,680
look into. But for now, I noticed that the SFO Bitchute channel has kind of been neglected

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,760
recently, and the autograbber hasn't been properly mirroring the videos. So I went back through my

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,960
backlog, I re-uploaded, you can see a bunch of old videos here, I re-uploaded a bunch of videos

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,400
that the grabber didn't get. I should have every single SFO video now on there, with the exception

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,560
of like some really old vlogs from like 2013 or something, they don't really matter. Feel free to

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,840
go through, let me know if any videos aren't working, let me know if any videos are missing,

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,440
just in case I happened to miss one, if you want to watch the backlog on Bitchute, it's there.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,880
That is, by the way, Bitchute.com slash Sharp Feta Taku, like it has this this ID up here,

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,200
but I'm pretty sure if I just put in Sharp Feta Taku, it should work. Let's just see here,

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,280
yes it does, okay. So I spent pretty much today and yesterday going through my backlog, re-uploading

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,440
all the old videos, and now I'm going to start doing the same for my other alt channels,

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,840
Game Boomers and the Dev Kit. Game Boomers is going to be a huge project, but that's not a

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
big deal. The Dev Kit, meanwhile, is where I'm going to start putting stuff that's not,

20
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,680
it's not politics and it's not gaming, it's just like other, and I've kind of neglected that

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,720
channel for a while too, I'm going to start working on that, but basically this is what

22
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,280
I've been doing, please consider following me over on Bitchute, just because, frankly,

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,760
YouTube is a dumpster fire, and I'm sure at some point I'll be kicked off of it too,

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,440
so swing by Bitchute.com slash Sharp Feta Taku and consider supporting alt tech wherever you can,

25
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,520
and also try to get the other creators that you know, that you watch, that you love,

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,760
to migrate to alt tech too, because at some point YouTube is going to come for everyone that's not

27
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,320
mainstream media. Alright guys, I'll see you there. I love you.
