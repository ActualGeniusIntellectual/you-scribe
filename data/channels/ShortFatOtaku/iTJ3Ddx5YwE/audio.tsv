0	16880	One of the smaller people that I shouted out in my 100k video, actually Tina, clued me
16880	20120	into a discourse that was flying completely under my radar.
20120	25320	Apparently, back during the 7th console generation, that's the Wii, PS3, and 360, remember,
25320	30640	the term JRPG, short for Japanese Role Playing Game, was a dirty word.
30640	31640	Was it?
31640	33200	I couldn't remember this being a thing, at least initially.
33200	36200	I had to think pretty hard about it, dig up some old articles.
36200	39400	I asked Dave about it, who remembered that it was, and then it started to come back to
39400	40400	me.
40400	41400	Yeah, it was.
41400	45040	The Japanese RPG was the darling of the Super Nintendo, and later the Playstation 1 and
45040	48440	2, specifically Square Enix games like the Final Fantasy series and Chrono Trigger.
48440	52800	Hell, Chrono Trigger is widely considered to be the greatest JRPG of all time.
52800	54040	And you know, I agree with them.
54040	57160	The story, the characters, the graphics and music for the time, all top notch.
57160	61080	And the combat is about as tightly refined as turn-based stuff would ever get.
61080	65800	Even my Zoomer girlfriend, who cannot stand playing 2D games, really enjoyed Chrono Trigger
65800	67760	when I forced her to sit down and play through it.
67760	68760	Yes, I did that.
68760	69760	Yes, I'm an old man.
69760	73740	No, I'm not going to bow to Zoomer casual gaming sensibilities.
73740	78080	But once gaming moved into the late 2000s, a whole bunch of things changed.
78080	81860	The earliest YouTubers and streamers became popular, with let's players and reviewers
81860	86620	outside of the grip of game companies giving honest, unfiltered feedback on games.
86620	87780	The market shifted too.
87780	91620	The Wii brought in a ton of casual gamers who were only interested in waggling around
91620	96080	a Wii remote, while the PS3 and 360 were locked in a battle of hardware dominance that was
96080	98580	seeing diminishing returns each generation.
98580	103120	The popular games of the era were overwhelmingly brown and bloom first person shooters like
103120	104120	Call of Duty.
104120	108300	And when big name Western RPG franchises like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout saw their return
108300	112580	to prominence through Bethesda, they were also brown and bloom first person games.
112580	116300	If you went back in time and told a Fallout fan of the 90s that this was the future's
116300	118660	Fallout 3, they would have never believed you.
118660	120420	And yet, Fallout 3 is a pretty good game.
120420	122780	Meanwhile, Japanese RPGs weren't looking so hot.
122780	126740	The big title of the era, the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy, was hot garbage.
126740	130620	The other games that came out at the time, like Enchanted Arms, Tales of Vesperia, Eternal
130620	132620	Sonata, Blue Dragon, they were all kind of mid.
132620	133820	Sorry, but it's true.
133820	136460	I'm not faulting you for liking those games if you do.
136500	140260	Tales of Vesperia has a soft spot in my heart for sure, being one of the only games that
140260	142740	a younger, broker dev could afford at the time.
142740	145160	But this was not the golden era of the genre.
145160	149020	Like I described in my Forspoken video, Square Enix was once a company that could decide
149020	150700	the fate of a platform.
150700	154020	People bought Super Nintendos for Final Fantasy 6 and Chrono Trigger.
154020	156700	People bought PlayStation 1s for Final Fantasy 7.
156700	160780	Fast forward to Final Fantasy 15, sure that's an alright game, but was it single-handedly
160780	162060	carrying the PS4?
162060	163060	No.
163060	166780	PS4s were still flying off store shelves, but that was due to games like Spider-Man,
166780	170540	Red Dead Redemption 2, Witcher 3, The Last of Us 2, Grand Theft Auto 5.
170540	173660	Now it's not like Japanese games as a whole had collapsed.
173660	176420	Bloodborne is one of the PS4's most beloved titles.
176420	180960	But it's clear that for nearly 20 years now, Square Enix has been coasting by on nostalgia
180960	182100	and goodwill.
182100	185860	Your average unplugged millennial normie, who can only spare a couple of hours a week
185860	189340	to play video games nowadays, still has fond memories of Final Fantasy 7.
189340	193460	And I'm sure he enjoyed the Final Fantasy 7 remake as he slowly grazed his way through
193460	194740	it over six months or so.
194740	198980	But it's not a very good game, and new audiences don't have Final Fantasy nostalgia to fall
198980	199980	back on.
199980	201780	Same with Final Fantasy 15, frankly.
201780	206220	In fact, Forspoken was Square Enix's final Hail Mary of the old way of doing things.
206220	210700	And it turns out, that game has done so poorly that it's tanked the Luminous Productions
210700	214060	development studio and the Square Enix president is getting replaced.
214060	215760	What an absolute clusterfuck.
216280	221120	Even though I'm a huge JRPG fan, there was that forgotten period of time in the late
221120	226700	2000s and early 2010s where JRPG was kind of a dirty word, where JRPG fans were hated
226700	230300	on a little bit, where the trend of video games had shifted in a different direction.
230300	234720	And the director of the upcoming Final Fantasy 16, Naoki Yoshida, otherwise known as Yoshi
234720	240540	P, sparked a firestorm by stating in a recent interview that in Japan, JRPG is now viewed
240540	245100	as a discriminatory term that people like him were made fun of for creating JRPGs back
245100	248220	in the day, and so Japanese developers don't like using it.
248220	253660	He is even reluctant to call Final Fantasy 16 a JRPG, even though Final Fantasy is the
253660	256860	granddaddy of the genre, for this precise reason.
256860	262180	Local Twitter idiot AP Zone Runner's now-deleted tweet taking out of context a snippet of that
262180	263580	interview went viral.
263580	268360	FF16 looks dope as fuck, but this interview quote feels like such a colossal misreading
268360	274180	of what FF15 actually is, and FF7 Remake actually, and sort of the point of its juxtaposition.
274180	277260	I'm quite shocked to see it deployed in the hype cycle for the next game.
277260	278260	The snippet reads,
278260	283220	In talking about Final Fantasy 16's darker tone, Yoshida said, the past ten or so years
283220	286320	of Final Fantasy has been about how bright the series is.
286320	289580	You still have these dark themes about how we're going to save the world, but then
289580	293160	it's like you have these kids that are in their teens, running around saving the world,
293160	296260	having fun and going fishing and things like that, even though the world is supposed to
296260	297260	be ending.
297260	298960	And so there's not a sense of reality.
298960	302660	And fair enough, Final Fantasy 15 had a pretty apocalyptic element to it, but there was also
302660	306900	so much lounging around to do in the game, chocobo races, fishing spots, going camping.
306900	311560	I remember social media of the time loving it for how goofy Noctis was in his off time
311560	313060	in comparison to the main plot.
313060	317040	But Final Fantasy 16 seems to be stripping the futuristic elements out of the game again
317040	321020	and going back to its medieval roots, complete with a Game of Thrones style plot full of
321020	323180	corrupt nobles and wars between houses.
323180	326300	It really sounds like we're going back to the days of Final Fantasy Tactics, with different
326300	329380	feudal lords fighting over who gets to sit on the imperial throne or something.
329380	331980	This became known as the Blitzball discourse.
331980	335740	Blitzball is probably the most egregious Final Fantasy minigame of all time.
335740	339520	In Final Fantasy X, there are these floating globes of water that teams who can hold their
339520	342900	breath for hours at a time, I guess, play 3D underwater soccer in.
342900	346460	It's ridiculous, it's goofy, it's not really all that fun to play, and it's the main thing
346460	350620	people think about when they hear the name Final Fantasy X 20 years later.
350620	354940	Also the voice acting.
354940	359180	It's called the Blitzball discourse because Blitzball is emblematic of the Final Fantasy
359180	363660	series' constant shoehorning in of weird side games that don't really mesh well with the
363660	367240	main game, in any way, in terms of story, or how fun they are to play, or how alike
367240	370420	they are to the rest of the game, sometimes even in terms of their art style.
370420	374020	But nonetheless, to the fans these are considered beloved quirks of the genre.
374020	378520	The bit of the Yoshida interview that went viral seems to be Yoshida disparaging older
378520	383500	Final Fantasy games for lacking focus, and that Final Fantasy 16 would not be this way.
383500	388020	But that whole topic was actually addressed in the very same interview, the Twitter idiot
388020	389740	just didn't post the context.
389740	393340	Yoshida did say that while the game was going to be darker than the last few titles, and
393340	396820	that there would definitely be no Blitzball, there would still be fun side content.
396820	400140	You could go to a base that you can build up, you can go on hunts to take down legendary
400140	401140	monsters.
401140	404580	It wasn't just going to be a series of hallways connecting set pieces and cutscenes like a
404580	406940	lot of western games have been in the past decade.
406940	408540	So a quick recap of the drama.
408540	412740	Yoshida said in a recent interview he doesn't want to call Final Fantasy 16 a JRPG because
412740	416300	JRPG is considered a disparaging term among Japanese game developers.
416300	420180	This stems from the poor western reception of Japanese games from 10 to 15 years ago,
420180	424180	as opposed to the height of the genre during the Super Nintendo and Playstation 1 days.
424180	428200	And so, game journalists and developers, being a bunch of progressive twitter addicts, decided
428200	433300	to take this as Yoshida saying that he hates JRPGs, and that he is being a self-hating
433300	434300	racist.
434300	438780	Meanwhile, these same progs were the source of the racism from back then.
438780	439780	Y'all remember this shit?
439780	443220	Remember Alex Hutchinson saying that Japanese games were all gibberish, and that the only
443220	447480	reason Japanese games like Bayonetta score as high as they do is because of a subtle
447480	451160	racism in the business, especially on the journalist side where Japanese developers
451160	452940	are forgiven for doing what they do?
452940	457660	This is a progressive in 2012 appealing to the soft bigotry of low expectations.
457660	461620	This is now considered a right-wing talking point in today's political climate.
461620	464460	Alex would be crucified as an alt-righter today.
464460	469380	Remember former indie darling and Fez creator Phil Fish saying that in 2012 Japanese games
469380	473780	just suck, and then mocked the possibility that any of this could come from a place of
473780	474780	racism?
474780	477700	Seriously, if you go back and look at these people, they're doing everything that they
477700	479420	now shit on others for today.
479420	481460	Here's the GDQ clip when it happened.
509420	517620	And what kind of about recentry Japanese, what do you think about the recentry Japanese
517620	518620	game?
518620	520620	Is it what is about Japanese games and inspired us?
520620	521620	Recent.
521620	522620	Recent.
522620	523620	Recent.
523620	524620	I'm sorry.
524620	525620	They suck.
525620	526620	I'm sorry.
526620	533140	Like, you guys need to get with the times and make better interfaces and, like, update
533140	535140	your technology.
535140	536620	We're totally kicking your ass.
536820	541100	Back then, you guys were the king of the world, but time has passed.
541100	543340	That guy that Phil Fish just shat on, by the way?
543340	547300	That's not just some random Japanese guy, as the West reported on back in the day.
547300	550420	Really playing up that all Asians look alike racism here, guys.
550420	551500	That's Makoto Goto.
551500	555940	He worked on Final Fantasy, Front Mission, Armored Core, and most recently, AI The Somnium
555940	556940	Files.
556940	557940	Meanwhile, what's Phil Fish doing?
557940	559140	Oh, fucking nothing.
559140	560940	He made Fez in 2012, and that's it.
560940	563580	Hey, uh, you wanna know some deep SFO lore?
563580	566860	A lot of the articles floating around the internet today claim that Phil Fish left the
566860	570620	gaming industry due to the harassment he received during Gamergate.
570620	574900	That's technically true, but it wasn't harassment, it was an expose, by our channel.
574900	579420	Back in 2014, a bunch of the financial documents of Phil Fish's company, Polytron, hit 4chan.
579420	583460	He blamed angry gamergaters hacking his company, but analysis of the files showed that they
583460	587580	came from a flash drive, which makes it much more likely that a disgruntled Polytron employee
587580	591340	dumped them onto the internet as revenge for Phil Fish's shitty behavior.
591340	594500	We got a hold of the files, and after doing some cross-referencing, noticed that the list
594500	598760	of Polytron's investors, a private list, by the way, were the same people who were judges
598760	600860	at the Independent Games Festival.
600860	604900	These people were set to make money with the success of Fez and the increased valuation
604900	606520	of Polytron as a company.
606520	611020	This also explains why, despite the IGF-stated rules that games can only win awards on the
611020	616700	year they come out, Fez won awards during both 2008's IGF and 2012's IGF, with the
616700	620660	IGF claiming that the 2008 version was a different game because it was a demo.
620660	625780	Fez is, to my knowledge, the only game to have been privileged in this way by the IGF,
625780	630540	and is also the only one where people in the IGF stood to make personal profit off the
630540	633740	success of a game that they were supposed to be impartially judging.
633740	638980	My video back in 2014 spooked the indie game scene so much that the IGF actually rushed
638980	643100	out a short blurb that basically said, we have investigated ourselves and found nothing
643100	644100	wrong.
644100	646780	You can even go back and see it on their website, it's still there.
646780	650860	There's an old Forbes article that implies that I privated my videos because the information
650860	652220	in them was false.
652220	653220	That's not true at all.
653220	656300	I stand by the information in my gamergate videos nine years later.
656300	660740	I privated them because Phil Fish sent me a cease and desist, and I was a recent university
660740	662660	graduate and I was poor as fuck.
662660	665860	If there's one thing that I do regret it's that, I should have made him sue me.
665860	669260	I put the videos back up a few months later, and they remain up to this day.
669260	672180	Now that I'm not a channel with only a couple thousand subs anymore, now that I've made
672180	675860	a few more connections with people over the years, I've heard through the grapevine
675860	681300	that one big reason Phil Fish doesn't make indie games anymore is because my video exposed
681300	685140	him and his friends to be fucking snakes, and outside of the progressive clique, people
685140	686660	don't really want to work with him anymore.
686660	690540	So yeah, Phil Fish did get harassed out of the game industry by gamergate, but to use
690540	693380	modern terminology, he got cancelled by me.
693380	696020	Meanwhile Makoto Gotou's career is alive and well.
696020	700180	It might take a long time, it might take over a decade guys, but truth does tend to win
700180	701460	out in the long run.
701460	703320	Alright deep SFO lore time over.
703320	707480	The point is, Phil Fish and everyone else like him treated Japanese games and Japanese
707480	711360	people like shit, and they now try to paint themselves as progressive darlings.
711360	712880	You know who else has done that?
712880	717600	Adam Sessler, otherwise known as Big Clap Man from the twice failed channel G4.
717600	739080	Let's see what he had to say about JRPGs back in 2004.
739080	746840	Alright the story, let me guess, there's probably a young hero with some sort of memory
746840	751800	problem who's fighting a vastly overwhelming emo-fascio magical empire, cliche-burdened
751800	758040	boy of action who will save us all is named Sagi, rhymes with Saki, which I could use
758040	761520	a lot of right now.
761520	765880	And apparently nothing says prequel like improved breast physics on the shopkeepers.
765880	784720	Okay, haha, I did not expect Morgan Webb to be promoting the great replacement theory
784720	787280	in today's video, that was a bit out of left field.
787280	791680	But yeah, these people pin themselves as anti-racist progressives nowadays.
791680	795900	This clip is full of racism, but it is clearly meant as a juvenile joke.
795900	799640	If Sessler were a serious racist, like an actual alt writer or something, he probably
799640	803140	wouldn't be complaining about the fascist empire that features in the game he's reviewing.
803140	805360	He was just being edgy, and I can appreciate that.
805360	809360	That is the brand of stupid internet humor that I like, just acting retarded for a laugh.
809360	812760	I would have laughed a lot at this back in the day, hell I laughed a little at it now.
812760	817880	But the point is, Adam Sessler, the people at G4 who made this, are now morally grandstanding
817880	822640	at you because you're not on the bleeding edge of the next progressive culture war.
822640	825560	And this wasn't the only time G4 did stuff like this.
825560	828520	I'm an old G4 viewer, and I remember it happening pretty regularly.
828520	832320	A lot of it's been unfortunately lost to time, but I did manage to scrounge up one
832320	834200	more clip from the old days.
834200	838920	We have with us now the communications director of the Digital Devil Saga campaign, Kiyoko
838920	843280	Toriyama, with a reaction to the criticisms that their game was just too difficult to
843280	844280	understand.
844280	846280	Morgan-san, thank you for being here.
846280	848280	I'm so happy to be here.
848280	853280	I'm a member of the American Dream Player, and I'm so happy to be able to be here.
853280	860280	I'm so happy to be able to share my story with you, and I'm so happy to be here.
864200	871200	What the hell was that supposed to mean?
884240	891240	I'm Kiyoko Toriyama, and I'm so happy to be here.
894200	901200	Now, see, I found that funny, but I wonder if Morgan Webb or Adam Sessler would still
901200	908200	refer to the Japanese as a race of zany, bean-curd-loving, inevitable rulers of the West in 2023.
908200	909200	Probably not.
909200	912200	And, by the way, they'll call you a big dick.
912200	917200	I'm Kiyoko Toriyama, and I'm so happy to be here.
917200	920200	I'm Kiyoko Toriyama, and I'm so happy to be here.
920200	923200	I'm Kiyoko Toriyama, and I'm so happy to be here.
923200	927200	I'm Kiyoko Toriyama, and I'm so happy to be here.
928200	937200	And, by the way, they'll call you a bigot for enjoying comedy that was just normal back then, comedy that they produced for you to laugh at.
937200	944200	It's okay if they want to do racist Japanese accents, but you are a fascist if you don't want a drag queen twerking in front of a child.
944200	955200	The late 2000s internet was stuffed full of people hating on everything Japanese, up to and including racism, who now present themselves as the bastions of proper leftist politics.
955200	962200	A lot of this stuff has been lost to time, either because the people involved have scrubbed it out of embarrassment, or websites have died or articles have been deleted or whatever,
962200	966200	but there's enough of it still floating around that it's not hard to get a glimpse of what it was like.
966200	974200	These people's shitty behavior was so poorly received in Japan that, like Yoshida said, Japanese developers began to view their own styles, their own genres, as bad.
974200	982200	One of the reasons why a lot of Japanese developers have abandoned what once made them good in favor of more Western-focused games is because of this backlash.
982200	992200	I'm not surprised that the word JRPG holds this negative connotation over there, and to see the people who caused that now come out and say that hating JRPGs is racist? Fuck off.
992200	1001200	If these people were actually intelligent, and actually capable of critiquing video games, and actually wanted to analyze what was going on here, beyond just being racist pricks, here's what they would say.
1001200	1004200	In terms of video games, the most influential game of all time is Pong.
1004200	1008200	The second most influential one is not a video game at all, it's Dungeons and Dragons.
1008200	1014200	Released in 1974, Dungeons and Dragons was an attempt to marry war miniatures with a Tolkien-like fantasy adventure.
1014200	1020200	A lot of the nerds of the 70s who played D&D were also the same nerds who were messing around with the earliest Play-Doh computers,
1020200	1025200	and so it's no surprise to me that there were early attempts to try and make a computer play the role of a dungeon master.
1025200	1034200	These early games were blatant D&D rip-offs, with random number generators taking the place of dice, with stats and combat and leveling out all playing out like D&D handled by a computer.
1034200	1044200	The most notable of these was the appropriately named Moria from 1975, where 10 players on a local network all took turns walking through a procedurally generated mine, killing monsters and getting loot.
1044200	1052200	The idea of a computer generating random dungeons was so interesting that it led to the 1980 seminal title Rogue, from which we get today's roguelike.
1052200	1058200	Core components of Rogue are that the dungeon is different every time, and that character death is permanent, forcing you to restart the game.
1058200	1061200	Two qualities that you can still see traces of in modern roguelikes today.
1061200	1072200	When the Apple II computer became a relatively common middle-class household furnishing in 1977, a new generation of developers began to see if they could recreate those early D&D rip-offs on the new hardware.
1072200	1078200	This led to two very important, but very different games, both released in 1981, Wizardry and Ultima.
1078200	1086200	In Wizardry, you start the game by building a party, buying your gear, and then you're dropped into a D&D-style dungeon on a grid with random enemies and treasure and traps.
1086200	1093200	Combat is turn-based, according to a barebones version of D&D rules, and you spend your time in this claustrophobic catacomb exploring and leveling up.
1093200	1101200	Ultima, meanwhile, featured a top-down exploration system, akin to a D&D-style world map, where you could walk around and find new locations, towns to visit with NPCs to talk to.
1101200	1105200	I know this is all really common stuff nowadays, but Ultima was the first game to do it.
1105200	1111200	The dungeons were still first-person and grid-like, though, like Wizardry's, due to their shared D&D origins.
1111200	1115200	Both of these games would inspire The Bard's Tale in 1985, which took aspects of both.
1115200	1124200	The developers of that game, Interplay, believed that this format would work not only for medieval games, but futuristic ones, too, and adapted it to a post-apocalyptic setting for 1988's Wasteland.
1124200	1130200	The top-down perspective of Ultima was adapted to be an isometric perspective due to increasing graphical capability in the 90s.
1130200	1136200	Later Ultima games were the first isometric ones, and titles like Diablo and Baldur's Gate really made the format shine.
1136200	1141200	The developers of Wasteland made the jump, too, releasing the first Fallout game in this style.
1141200	1150200	In 1992, Ultima Underworld adapted the grid-like D&D dungeon to a more modern-looking first-person perspective that controlled almost like an FPS.
1150200	1154200	It was this innovation that inspired the first Elder Scrolls game in 1994.
1154200	1161200	At the same time, Japan was getting its own line of computers, Japanese gamers were playing imported copies of Wizardry and Ultima, and they were getting inspired.
1161200	1171200	The earliest Japanese developers began to make games of this type with their own twist, like 1984's Mugen no Shinzou, which is clearly based on Ultima, and Lizard from the same year, which is more like Wizardry.
1171200	1178200	In Japan, the next big thing was Nintendo's Famicom, which would be released as the NES in the West, and Japanese developers wanted to make RPGs for that system as well.
1178200	1189200	But the Famicom was meant to be cheap and affordable. The necessity of getting through that hardware bottleneck led to the developers at Enix streamlining all the qualities of RPGs that Japanese gamers loved into something that the Famicom could run.
1189200	1196200	The result was the first Dragon Quest game in 1986. It used Ultima's exploration and Wizardry's combat system.
1196200	1201200	Both had to be stripped of some complexity in order to run in the Famicom, but the end result wasn't a loss of quality.
1201200	1204200	Instead of creating a lesser product, they ended up cutting a lot of the fat.
1204200	1211200	What remained was a more tightly-focused experience, which is why Dragon Quest is considered the beginning of a new genre, the JRPG.
1211200	1217200	Japanese-made RPGs before this point were copies of Western RPGs. With Dragon Quest, they had become their own thing.
1217200	1229200	Overcoming the hardware limitations of the Famicom led to less procedural generation, more pre-programmed characters and encounters, less character customization, but more tightly-focused mechanics for your characters, less surprise, but more story to make up for it.
1229200	1236200	After Dragon Quest's success, we got Final Fantasy, we got Phantasy Star, in the next generation we got Chrono Trigger and Earthbound, and just an explosion of this genre.
1237200	1241200	Even though the hardware bottleneck of the Famicom was gone, the convention remained.
1241200	1255200	A JRPG differed from a WRPG in that, though they both used items and turn-based combat and magic spells and level-ups, JRPGs featured a more tightly-crafted story experience, while WRPGs allowed for more greater exploration and player choice.
1255200	1263200	This is because WRPGs remained on home computers, while JRPGs had to be adapted to consoles, and the limitations of each platform influenced the direction of game development.
1263200	1276200	What I'm getting at with all of this is, we can trace back to Dungeons and Dragons, not only the modern Western RPG, but the roguelike, top-down isometric RPGs and adventure games, text-based games, first-person RPGs like modern Fallout and Elder Scrolls and Mass Effect.
1276200	1285200	Hell, pretty much every single game has adapted an RPG-style stats system. Call of Duty has stats on its guns now, and that's the only kind of Call of Duty that kids today know.
1285200	1289200	That would have been considered blasphemous back when I was in school. Numbers were for fucking losers.
1289200	1298200	Large swaths of modern gaming has taken something from Dungeons and Dragons if you go back far enough, and the Japanese have contributed many innovations to all of these genres.
1298200	1305200	You can not like those genres and innovations, that's fine, but to claim that they're bad because they're Japanese is actually, yeah, pretty racist.
1305200	1314200	But if these people truly understood gaming, they'd know where the JRPG came from, the conventions of the genre, its pitfalls, yes, but the reasons for them,
1314200	1320200	and how Japanese developers do actually understand those pitfalls and contribute their own innovations to game design.
1320200	1327200	I actually really love this type of cross-cultural contamination, where one culture picks up an innovation from another and puts a spin on it and creates something new.
1327200	1337200	Games like Earthbound and Elite Premonition really rank up there for me, not because they're good, they've got serious flaws, but their whole thing is a Japanese attempt to write something that is authentically American.
1337200	1350200	They can't because they're not authentically American themselves, but the filtering of Americana through a Japanese lens, and then translated back into English for a Western release, created some very unique experiences that you can't really get anywhere else.
1350200	1364200	And the progressive indie developers who were inspired by these games to make their own quirky JRPG end up creating only pale imitations, because while they're attempting to create an American game filtered through a Japanese lens looking at America, they can't do it because they hate Japan.
1364200	1368200	This really just does stem from racism on the part of the progs.
1368200	1379200	Look at this delusional article, talking about how it's Western developers who truly understand what the JRPG is, how Japan is stagnant, and how progress in game design aligns with having leftist politics.
1379200	1391200	This article dropped within a year of Tales of Berseria, Dragon Quest XI, Persona 5, Nioh, Octopath Traveler, and Nier Automata, all of which contributed to a huge wave of quality Japanese games.
1391200	1400200	While the article holds up Western indie garbage like Yik as progress in JRPGs, and the entire thing is about millennial hipsters reliving their glory days.
1400200	1404200	Yik is going to have to be its own video one day, because that rabbit hole is way too deep.
1404200	1416200	But just to give you a taste, a good chunk of the game has the characters break the fourth wall to talk about the developers' other games in a way that makes clear that the developers really wanted those games to be their big breakaway hit, not Yik.
1417200	1423200	And this is what's really at the core of this conversation. Frankly, it's what's at the core of a lot of the gaming-centric videos I do on this channel.
1423200	1430200	If you're in your 30s like I am, hell for some of you even in your 20s, back when you were young, you were probably picked on for enjoying video games.
1430200	1433200	You were the nerdy kid that the popular boys beat up and the girls laughed at.
1433200	1438200	If you were a gamer girl, the popular girls probably beat you up, and the boys probably thought you were a poser.
1438200	1443200	For all of us, graduation was basically a relief. We could all move away and put these people safely in the rearview mirror.
1443200	1450200	But that's not how it turned out. All of these game journos, these progressive indie developers, they're all cut from the same cloth as the old bullies.
1450200	1454200	Now that gaming's popular and not just for nerds, they want a piece of the pie.
1454200	1458200	They want to say that they were always the real fans, the legitimate voice of what is in gaming.
1458200	1464200	And now that progressive politics are also popular, they want to forget everything in their past that they actually did.
1464200	1471200	From edgy humor, to racism, to bullying Japanese developers for being too Japanese, to bullying fans for liking Japanese games or games at all.
1471200	1477200	Look at Elden Ring. It's made by a Japanese company, and it's an RPG. Would we call it a JRPG? Well, probably not.
1477200	1484200	JRPGs as a genre came about due to adapting D&D conventions to hardware limitations, creating new conventions as a result.
1484200	1491200	Elden Ring has more in common with other open-world Western RPGs, where you can build your character how you like, customize your leveling experience, explore the world in any direction.
1491200	1496200	The combat is all Souls-like, of course. It's not turn-based. But no RPGs are turn-based anymore.
1496200	1500200	Mass Effect is a third-person shooter. Fallout is a first-person shooter. Top-down isometric games are all real-time now.
1500200	1506200	The only games that are still turn-based are either grand strategy games or developers appealing to old harbor limitations again.
1506200	1512200	Like how Sea of Stars is cut from the cloth of Chrono Trigger, or how Octopath Traveler feels like Final Fantasy 6 made 3D.
1512200	1519200	But even though Elden Ring is not a JRPG, it still received a lot of unwarranted backlash from game journals when it came out.
1519200	1522200	They were crying about how it's a bigoted game because it's not inclusive enough because it's hard.
1522200	1527200	Souls-like combat is notoriously hard. That's the whole point. But look at the circle that we've come around.
1527200	1542200	These people back in the day were shitting on Japanese game developers in a pretty racist way because they were still making turn-based RPGs and doing anime-style storylines in an era where Western developers were moving all of their RPGs into the realm of shooters and action games and going for more grimdark bullshit.
1542200	1556200	That poor reaction, as well as lowering sales over time, of Japanese games led to Japanese developers to feel a stigma around their own creations to the point that Japanese developers have largely abandoned large swaths of what made them unique and interesting.
1556200	1561200	Old beloved IPs like Mega Man and Castlevania are dead, and they seem to be never coming back.
1561200	1568200	The companies that own those IPs are now focusing almost exclusively on products that look like they're made by Western developers.
1568200	1580200	Games that used to be JRPGs, like Final Fantasy, are now action-based shadows of their former selves because, as Yoshida put it, Japanese developers feel they are discriminated against based on the kinds of games that they make.
1580200	1594200	And the racist, progressive fucks who caused all of this are now, years later, screaming that games are too hard and Japanese developers are not inclusive enough, when it was their mockery that caused the abandonment of a genre that was uniquely Japanese and was frankly pretty easy to play.
1594200	1597200	For turn-based games, all you gotta do is navigate through a fucking menu.
1597200	1604200	Game journalists and progressive indie developers are scumfucks. They are some of the worst, most hypocritical people you can bump into.
1604200	1614200	These people dare to claim some sort of a moral high ground when their racism, the very thing that they cancel people over today, caused the problem that they're complaining about right now. Fuck these people.
1634200	1636200	Thanks for watching.
