1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,880
One of the smaller people that I shouted out in my 100k video, actually Tina, clued me

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,120
into a discourse that was flying completely under my radar.

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,320
Apparently, back during the 7th console generation, that's the Wii, PS3, and 360, remember,

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,640
the term JRPG, short for Japanese Role Playing Game, was a dirty word.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
Was it?

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,200
I couldn't remember this being a thing, at least initially.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,200
I had to think pretty hard about it, dig up some old articles.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,400
I asked Dave about it, who remembered that it was, and then it started to come back to

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
me.

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Yeah, it was.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,040
The Japanese RPG was the darling of the Super Nintendo, and later the Playstation 1 and

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,440
2, specifically Square Enix games like the Final Fantasy series and Chrono Trigger.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,800
Hell, Chrono Trigger is widely considered to be the greatest JRPG of all time.

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,040
And you know, I agree with them.

15
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,160
The story, the characters, the graphics and music for the time, all top notch.

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,080
And the combat is about as tightly refined as turn-based stuff would ever get.

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,800
Even my Zoomer girlfriend, who cannot stand playing 2D games, really enjoyed Chrono Trigger

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,760
when I forced her to sit down and play through it.

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,760
Yes, I did that.

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
Yes, I'm an old man.

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,740
No, I'm not going to bow to Zoomer casual gaming sensibilities.

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,080
But once gaming moved into the late 2000s, a whole bunch of things changed.

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,860
The earliest YouTubers and streamers became popular, with let's players and reviewers

24
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,620
outside of the grip of game companies giving honest, unfiltered feedback on games.

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,780
The market shifted too.

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,620
The Wii brought in a ton of casual gamers who were only interested in waggling around

27
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,080
a Wii remote, while the PS3 and 360 were locked in a battle of hardware dominance that was

28
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,580
seeing diminishing returns each generation.

29
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,120
The popular games of the era were overwhelmingly brown and bloom first person shooters like

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,120
Call of Duty.

31
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,300
And when big name Western RPG franchises like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout saw their return

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,580
to prominence through Bethesda, they were also brown and bloom first person games.

33
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,300
If you went back in time and told a Fallout fan of the 90s that this was the future's

34
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,660
Fallout 3, they would have never believed you.

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,420
And yet, Fallout 3 is a pretty good game.

36
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,780
Meanwhile, Japanese RPGs weren't looking so hot.

37
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,740
The big title of the era, the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy, was hot garbage.

38
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,620
The other games that came out at the time, like Enchanted Arms, Tales of Vesperia, Eternal

39
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,620
Sonata, Blue Dragon, they were all kind of mid.

40
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,820
Sorry, but it's true.

41
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,460
I'm not faulting you for liking those games if you do.

42
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,260
Tales of Vesperia has a soft spot in my heart for sure, being one of the only games that

43
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,740
a younger, broker dev could afford at the time.

44
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,160
But this was not the golden era of the genre.

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,020
Like I described in my Forspoken video, Square Enix was once a company that could decide

46
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,700
the fate of a platform.

47
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,020
People bought Super Nintendos for Final Fantasy 6 and Chrono Trigger.

48
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,700
People bought PlayStation 1s for Final Fantasy 7.

49
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,780
Fast forward to Final Fantasy 15, sure that's an alright game, but was it single-handedly

50
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,060
carrying the PS4?

51
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,060
No.

52
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,780
PS4s were still flying off store shelves, but that was due to games like Spider-Man,

53
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,540
Red Dead Redemption 2, Witcher 3, The Last of Us 2, Grand Theft Auto 5.

54
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,660
Now it's not like Japanese games as a whole had collapsed.

55
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,420
Bloodborne is one of the PS4's most beloved titles.

56
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,960
But it's clear that for nearly 20 years now, Square Enix has been coasting by on nostalgia

57
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,100
and goodwill.

58
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,860
Your average unplugged millennial normie, who can only spare a couple of hours a week

59
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,340
to play video games nowadays, still has fond memories of Final Fantasy 7.

60
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,460
And I'm sure he enjoyed the Final Fantasy 7 remake as he slowly grazed his way through

61
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,740
it over six months or so.

62
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,980
But it's not a very good game, and new audiences don't have Final Fantasy nostalgia to fall

63
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,980
back on.

64
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,780
Same with Final Fantasy 15, frankly.

65
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,220
In fact, Forspoken was Square Enix's final Hail Mary of the old way of doing things.

66
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,700
And it turns out, that game has done so poorly that it's tanked the Luminous Productions

67
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,060
development studio and the Square Enix president is getting replaced.

68
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,760
What an absolute clusterfuck.

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,120
Even though I'm a huge JRPG fan, there was that forgotten period of time in the late

70
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,700
2000s and early 2010s where JRPG was kind of a dirty word, where JRPG fans were hated

71
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,300
on a little bit, where the trend of video games had shifted in a different direction.

72
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,720
And the director of the upcoming Final Fantasy 16, Naoki Yoshida, otherwise known as Yoshi

73
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,540
P, sparked a firestorm by stating in a recent interview that in Japan, JRPG is now viewed

74
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,100
as a discriminatory term that people like him were made fun of for creating JRPGs back

75
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,220
in the day, and so Japanese developers don't like using it.

76
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,660
He is even reluctant to call Final Fantasy 16 a JRPG, even though Final Fantasy is the

77
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,860
granddaddy of the genre, for this precise reason.

78
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,180
Local Twitter idiot AP Zone Runner's now-deleted tweet taking out of context a snippet of that

79
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,580
interview went viral.

80
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,360
FF16 looks dope as fuck, but this interview quote feels like such a colossal misreading

81
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,180
of what FF15 actually is, and FF7 Remake actually, and sort of the point of its juxtaposition.

82
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,260
I'm quite shocked to see it deployed in the hype cycle for the next game.

83
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,260
The snippet reads,

84
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,220
In talking about Final Fantasy 16's darker tone, Yoshida said, the past ten or so years

85
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,320
of Final Fantasy has been about how bright the series is.

86
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,580
You still have these dark themes about how we're going to save the world, but then

87
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,160
it's like you have these kids that are in their teens, running around saving the world,

88
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,260
having fun and going fishing and things like that, even though the world is supposed to

89
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,260
be ending.

90
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,960
And so there's not a sense of reality.

91
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,660
And fair enough, Final Fantasy 15 had a pretty apocalyptic element to it, but there was also

92
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,900
so much lounging around to do in the game, chocobo races, fishing spots, going camping.

93
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,560
I remember social media of the time loving it for how goofy Noctis was in his off time

94
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,060
in comparison to the main plot.

95
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,040
But Final Fantasy 16 seems to be stripping the futuristic elements out of the game again

96
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,020
and going back to its medieval roots, complete with a Game of Thrones style plot full of

97
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,180
corrupt nobles and wars between houses.

98
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,300
It really sounds like we're going back to the days of Final Fantasy Tactics, with different

99
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,380
feudal lords fighting over who gets to sit on the imperial throne or something.

100
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,980
This became known as the Blitzball discourse.

101
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,740
Blitzball is probably the most egregious Final Fantasy minigame of all time.

102
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,520
In Final Fantasy X, there are these floating globes of water that teams who can hold their

103
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,900
breath for hours at a time, I guess, play 3D underwater soccer in.

104
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,460
It's ridiculous, it's goofy, it's not really all that fun to play, and it's the main thing

105
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,620
people think about when they hear the name Final Fantasy X 20 years later.

106
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,940
Also the voice acting.

107
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,180
It's called the Blitzball discourse because Blitzball is emblematic of the Final Fantasy

108
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,660
series' constant shoehorning in of weird side games that don't really mesh well with the

109
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,240
main game, in any way, in terms of story, or how fun they are to play, or how alike

110
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,420
they are to the rest of the game, sometimes even in terms of their art style.

111
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,020
But nonetheless, to the fans these are considered beloved quirks of the genre.

112
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,520
The bit of the Yoshida interview that went viral seems to be Yoshida disparaging older

113
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,500
Final Fantasy games for lacking focus, and that Final Fantasy 16 would not be this way.

114
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,020
But that whole topic was actually addressed in the very same interview, the Twitter idiot

115
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,740
just didn't post the context.

116
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,340
Yoshida did say that while the game was going to be darker than the last few titles, and

117
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,820
that there would definitely be no Blitzball, there would still be fun side content.

118
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,140
You could go to a base that you can build up, you can go on hunts to take down legendary

119
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,140
monsters.

120
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,580
It wasn't just going to be a series of hallways connecting set pieces and cutscenes like a

121
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,940
lot of western games have been in the past decade.

122
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,540
So a quick recap of the drama.

123
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,740
Yoshida said in a recent interview he doesn't want to call Final Fantasy 16 a JRPG because

124
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,300
JRPG is considered a disparaging term among Japanese game developers.

125
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,180
This stems from the poor western reception of Japanese games from 10 to 15 years ago,

126
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,180
as opposed to the height of the genre during the Super Nintendo and Playstation 1 days.

127
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,200
And so, game journalists and developers, being a bunch of progressive twitter addicts, decided

128
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,300
to take this as Yoshida saying that he hates JRPGs, and that he is being a self-hating

129
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,300
racist.

130
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,780
Meanwhile, these same progs were the source of the racism from back then.

131
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,780
Y'all remember this shit?

132
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,220
Remember Alex Hutchinson saying that Japanese games were all gibberish, and that the only

133
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,480
reason Japanese games like Bayonetta score as high as they do is because of a subtle

134
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,160
racism in the business, especially on the journalist side where Japanese developers

135
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,940
are forgiven for doing what they do?

136
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,660
This is a progressive in 2012 appealing to the soft bigotry of low expectations.

137
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,620
This is now considered a right-wing talking point in today's political climate.

138
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,460
Alex would be crucified as an alt-righter today.

139
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,380
Remember former indie darling and Fez creator Phil Fish saying that in 2012 Japanese games

140
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,780
just suck, and then mocked the possibility that any of this could come from a place of

141
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,780
racism?

142
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,700
Seriously, if you go back and look at these people, they're doing everything that they

143
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,420
now shit on others for today.

144
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,460
Here's the GDQ clip when it happened.

145
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:37,620
And what kind of about recentry Japanese, what do you think about the recentry Japanese

146
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,620
game?

147
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,620
Is it what is about Japanese games and inspired us?

148
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,620
Recent.

149
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,620
Recent.

150
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,620
Recent.

151
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,620
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,620
They suck.

153
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,620
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:53,140
Like, you guys need to get with the times and make better interfaces and, like, update

155
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,140
your technology.

156
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,620
We're totally kicking your ass.

157
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,100
Back then, you guys were the king of the world, but time has passed.

158
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,340
That guy that Phil Fish just shat on, by the way?

159
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,300
That's not just some random Japanese guy, as the West reported on back in the day.

160
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,420
Really playing up that all Asians look alike racism here, guys.

161
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,500
That's Makoto Goto.

162
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,940
He worked on Final Fantasy, Front Mission, Armored Core, and most recently, AI The Somnium

163
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,940
Files.

164
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,940
Meanwhile, what's Phil Fish doing?

165
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,140
Oh, fucking nothing.

166
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,940
He made Fez in 2012, and that's it.

167
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,580
Hey, uh, you wanna know some deep SFO lore?

168
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,860
A lot of the articles floating around the internet today claim that Phil Fish left the

169
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,620
gaming industry due to the harassment he received during Gamergate.

170
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,900
That's technically true, but it wasn't harassment, it was an expose, by our channel.

171
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,420
Back in 2014, a bunch of the financial documents of Phil Fish's company, Polytron, hit 4chan.

172
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,460
He blamed angry gamergaters hacking his company, but analysis of the files showed that they

173
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,580
came from a flash drive, which makes it much more likely that a disgruntled Polytron employee

174
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,340
dumped them onto the internet as revenge for Phil Fish's shitty behavior.

175
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,500
We got a hold of the files, and after doing some cross-referencing, noticed that the list

176
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,760
of Polytron's investors, a private list, by the way, were the same people who were judges

177
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,860
at the Independent Games Festival.

178
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,900
These people were set to make money with the success of Fez and the increased valuation

179
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,520
of Polytron as a company.

180
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,020
This also explains why, despite the IGF-stated rules that games can only win awards on the

181
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:16,700
year they come out, Fez won awards during both 2008's IGF and 2012's IGF, with the

182
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,660
IGF claiming that the 2008 version was a different game because it was a demo.

183
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,780
Fez is, to my knowledge, the only game to have been privileged in this way by the IGF,

184
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,540
and is also the only one where people in the IGF stood to make personal profit off the

185
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,740
success of a game that they were supposed to be impartially judging.

186
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,980
My video back in 2014 spooked the indie game scene so much that the IGF actually rushed

187
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,100
out a short blurb that basically said, we have investigated ourselves and found nothing

188
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
wrong.

189
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,780
You can even go back and see it on their website, it's still there.

190
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,860
There's an old Forbes article that implies that I privated my videos because the information

191
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,220
in them was false.

192
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,220
That's not true at all.

193
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,300
I stand by the information in my gamergate videos nine years later.

194
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,740
I privated them because Phil Fish sent me a cease and desist, and I was a recent university

195
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,660
graduate and I was poor as fuck.

196
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,860
If there's one thing that I do regret it's that, I should have made him sue me.

197
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,260
I put the videos back up a few months later, and they remain up to this day.

198
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,180
Now that I'm not a channel with only a couple thousand subs anymore, now that I've made

199
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,860
a few more connections with people over the years, I've heard through the grapevine

200
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:21,300
that one big reason Phil Fish doesn't make indie games anymore is because my video exposed

201
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,140
him and his friends to be fucking snakes, and outside of the progressive clique, people

202
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,660
don't really want to work with him anymore.

203
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,540
So yeah, Phil Fish did get harassed out of the game industry by gamergate, but to use

204
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,380
modern terminology, he got cancelled by me.

205
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,020
Meanwhile Makoto Gotou's career is alive and well.

206
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,180
It might take a long time, it might take over a decade guys, but truth does tend to win

207
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,460
out in the long run.

208
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,320
Alright deep SFO lore time over.

209
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,480
The point is, Phil Fish and everyone else like him treated Japanese games and Japanese

210
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,360
people like shit, and they now try to paint themselves as progressive darlings.

211
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,880
You know who else has done that?

212
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,600
Adam Sessler, otherwise known as Big Clap Man from the twice failed channel G4.

213
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:19,080
Let's see what he had to say about JRPGs back in 2004.

214
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:26,840
Alright the story, let me guess, there's probably a young hero with some sort of memory

215
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,800
problem who's fighting a vastly overwhelming emo-fascio magical empire, cliche-burdened

216
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:38,040
boy of action who will save us all is named Sagi, rhymes with Saki, which I could use

217
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,520
a lot of right now.

218
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,880
And apparently nothing says prequel like improved breast physics on the shopkeepers.

219
00:12:45,880 --> 00:13:04,720
Okay, haha, I did not expect Morgan Webb to be promoting the great replacement theory

220
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,280
in today's video, that was a bit out of left field.

221
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,680
But yeah, these people pin themselves as anti-racist progressives nowadays.

222
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,900
This clip is full of racism, but it is clearly meant as a juvenile joke.

223
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,640
If Sessler were a serious racist, like an actual alt writer or something, he probably

224
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,140
wouldn't be complaining about the fascist empire that features in the game he's reviewing.

225
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,360
He was just being edgy, and I can appreciate that.

226
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,360
That is the brand of stupid internet humor that I like, just acting retarded for a laugh.

227
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,760
I would have laughed a lot at this back in the day, hell I laughed a little at it now.

228
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,880
But the point is, Adam Sessler, the people at G4 who made this, are now morally grandstanding

229
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,640
at you because you're not on the bleeding edge of the next progressive culture war.

230
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,560
And this wasn't the only time G4 did stuff like this.

231
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,520
I'm an old G4 viewer, and I remember it happening pretty regularly.

232
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,320
A lot of it's been unfortunately lost to time, but I did manage to scrounge up one

233
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,200
more clip from the old days.

234
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,920
We have with us now the communications director of the Digital Devil Saga campaign, Kiyoko

235
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,280
Toriyama, with a reaction to the criticisms that their game was just too difficult to

236
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
understand.

237
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Morgan-san, thank you for being here.

238
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
I'm so happy to be here.

239
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,280
I'm a member of the American Dream Player, and I'm so happy to be able to be here.

240
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:20,280
I'm so happy to be able to share my story with you, and I'm so happy to be here.

241
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:31,200
What the hell was that supposed to mean?

242
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,240
I'm Kiyoko Toriyama, and I'm so happy to be here.

243
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Now, see, I found that funny, but I wonder if Morgan Webb or Adam Sessler would still

244
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:08,200
refer to the Japanese as a race of zany, bean-curd-loving, inevitable rulers of the West in 2023.

245
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Probably not.

246
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,200
And, by the way, they'll call you a big dick.

247
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I'm Kiyoko Toriyama, and I'm so happy to be here.

248
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,200
I'm Kiyoko Toriyama, and I'm so happy to be here.

249
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm Kiyoko Toriyama, and I'm so happy to be here.

250
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm Kiyoko Toriyama, and I'm so happy to be here.

251
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:37,200
And, by the way, they'll call you a bigot for enjoying comedy that was just normal back then, comedy that they produced for you to laugh at.

252
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:44,200
It's okay if they want to do racist Japanese accents, but you are a fascist if you don't want a drag queen twerking in front of a child.

253
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:55,200
The late 2000s internet was stuffed full of people hating on everything Japanese, up to and including racism, who now present themselves as the bastions of proper leftist politics.

254
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:02,200
A lot of this stuff has been lost to time, either because the people involved have scrubbed it out of embarrassment, or websites have died or articles have been deleted or whatever,

255
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,200
but there's enough of it still floating around that it's not hard to get a glimpse of what it was like.

256
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:14,200
These people's shitty behavior was so poorly received in Japan that, like Yoshida said, Japanese developers began to view their own styles, their own genres, as bad.

257
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:22,200
One of the reasons why a lot of Japanese developers have abandoned what once made them good in favor of more Western-focused games is because of this backlash.

258
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:32,200
I'm not surprised that the word JRPG holds this negative connotation over there, and to see the people who caused that now come out and say that hating JRPGs is racist? Fuck off.

259
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:41,200
If these people were actually intelligent, and actually capable of critiquing video games, and actually wanted to analyze what was going on here, beyond just being racist pricks, here's what they would say.

260
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
In terms of video games, the most influential game of all time is Pong.

261
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,200
The second most influential one is not a video game at all, it's Dungeons and Dragons.

262
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Released in 1974, Dungeons and Dragons was an attempt to marry war miniatures with a Tolkien-like fantasy adventure.

263
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:00,200
A lot of the nerds of the 70s who played D&D were also the same nerds who were messing around with the earliest Play-Doh computers,

264
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,200
and so it's no surprise to me that there were early attempts to try and make a computer play the role of a dungeon master.

265
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:14,200
These early games were blatant D&D rip-offs, with random number generators taking the place of dice, with stats and combat and leveling out all playing out like D&D handled by a computer.

266
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:24,200
The most notable of these was the appropriately named Moria from 1975, where 10 players on a local network all took turns walking through a procedurally generated mine, killing monsters and getting loot.

267
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:32,200
The idea of a computer generating random dungeons was so interesting that it led to the 1980 seminal title Rogue, from which we get today's roguelike.

268
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Core components of Rogue are that the dungeon is different every time, and that character death is permanent, forcing you to restart the game.

269
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Two qualities that you can still see traces of in modern roguelikes today.

270
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:52,200
When the Apple II computer became a relatively common middle-class household furnishing in 1977, a new generation of developers began to see if they could recreate those early D&D rip-offs on the new hardware.

271
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,200
This led to two very important, but very different games, both released in 1981, Wizardry and Ultima.

272
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:06,200
In Wizardry, you start the game by building a party, buying your gear, and then you're dropped into a D&D-style dungeon on a grid with random enemies and treasure and traps.

273
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Combat is turn-based, according to a barebones version of D&D rules, and you spend your time in this claustrophobic catacomb exploring and leveling up.

274
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Ultima, meanwhile, featured a top-down exploration system, akin to a D&D-style world map, where you could walk around and find new locations, towns to visit with NPCs to talk to.

275
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,200
I know this is all really common stuff nowadays, but Ultima was the first game to do it.

276
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,200
The dungeons were still first-person and grid-like, though, like Wizardry's, due to their shared D&D origins.

277
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Both of these games would inspire The Bard's Tale in 1985, which took aspects of both.

278
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:44,200
The developers of that game, Interplay, believed that this format would work not only for medieval games, but futuristic ones, too, and adapted it to a post-apocalyptic setting for 1988's Wasteland.

279
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:50,200
The top-down perspective of Ultima was adapted to be an isometric perspective due to increasing graphical capability in the 90s.

280
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Later Ultima games were the first isometric ones, and titles like Diablo and Baldur's Gate really made the format shine.

281
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,200
The developers of Wasteland made the jump, too, releasing the first Fallout game in this style.

282
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:10,200
In 1992, Ultima Underworld adapted the grid-like D&D dungeon to a more modern-looking first-person perspective that controlled almost like an FPS.

283
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,200
It was this innovation that inspired the first Elder Scrolls game in 1994.

284
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:21,200
At the same time, Japan was getting its own line of computers, Japanese gamers were playing imported copies of Wizardry and Ultima, and they were getting inspired.

285
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:31,200
The earliest Japanese developers began to make games of this type with their own twist, like 1984's Mugen no Shinzou, which is clearly based on Ultima, and Lizard from the same year, which is more like Wizardry.

286
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,200
In Japan, the next big thing was Nintendo's Famicom, which would be released as the NES in the West, and Japanese developers wanted to make RPGs for that system as well.

287
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:49,200
But the Famicom was meant to be cheap and affordable. The necessity of getting through that hardware bottleneck led to the developers at Enix streamlining all the qualities of RPGs that Japanese gamers loved into something that the Famicom could run.

288
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:56,200
The result was the first Dragon Quest game in 1986. It used Ultima's exploration and Wizardry's combat system.

289
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Both had to be stripped of some complexity in order to run in the Famicom, but the end result wasn't a loss of quality.

290
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Instead of creating a lesser product, they ended up cutting a lot of the fat.

291
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:11,200
What remained was a more tightly-focused experience, which is why Dragon Quest is considered the beginning of a new genre, the JRPG.

292
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Japanese-made RPGs before this point were copies of Western RPGs. With Dragon Quest, they had become their own thing.

293
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Overcoming the hardware limitations of the Famicom led to less procedural generation, more pre-programmed characters and encounters, less character customization, but more tightly-focused mechanics for your characters, less surprise, but more story to make up for it.

294
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:36,200
After Dragon Quest's success, we got Final Fantasy, we got Phantasy Star, in the next generation we got Chrono Trigger and Earthbound, and just an explosion of this genre.

295
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Even though the hardware bottleneck of the Famicom was gone, the convention remained.

296
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:55,200
A JRPG differed from a WRPG in that, though they both used items and turn-based combat and magic spells and level-ups, JRPGs featured a more tightly-crafted story experience, while WRPGs allowed for more greater exploration and player choice.

297
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:03,200
This is because WRPGs remained on home computers, while JRPGs had to be adapted to consoles, and the limitations of each platform influenced the direction of game development.

298
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:16,200
What I'm getting at with all of this is, we can trace back to Dungeons and Dragons, not only the modern Western RPG, but the roguelike, top-down isometric RPGs and adventure games, text-based games, first-person RPGs like modern Fallout and Elder Scrolls and Mass Effect.

299
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Hell, pretty much every single game has adapted an RPG-style stats system. Call of Duty has stats on its guns now, and that's the only kind of Call of Duty that kids today know.

300
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,200
That would have been considered blasphemous back when I was in school. Numbers were for fucking losers.

301
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Large swaths of modern gaming has taken something from Dungeons and Dragons if you go back far enough, and the Japanese have contributed many innovations to all of these genres.

302
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:45,200
You can not like those genres and innovations, that's fine, but to claim that they're bad because they're Japanese is actually, yeah, pretty racist.

303
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:54,200
But if these people truly understood gaming, they'd know where the JRPG came from, the conventions of the genre, its pitfalls, yes, but the reasons for them,

304
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,200
and how Japanese developers do actually understand those pitfalls and contribute their own innovations to game design.

305
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:07,200
I actually really love this type of cross-cultural contamination, where one culture picks up an innovation from another and puts a spin on it and creates something new.

306
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:17,200
Games like Earthbound and Elite Premonition really rank up there for me, not because they're good, they've got serious flaws, but their whole thing is a Japanese attempt to write something that is authentically American.

307
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:30,200
They can't because they're not authentically American themselves, but the filtering of Americana through a Japanese lens, and then translated back into English for a Western release, created some very unique experiences that you can't really get anywhere else.

308
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:44,200
And the progressive indie developers who were inspired by these games to make their own quirky JRPG end up creating only pale imitations, because while they're attempting to create an American game filtered through a Japanese lens looking at America, they can't do it because they hate Japan.

309
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,200
This really just does stem from racism on the part of the progs.

310
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Look at this delusional article, talking about how it's Western developers who truly understand what the JRPG is, how Japan is stagnant, and how progress in game design aligns with having leftist politics.

311
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:11,200
This article dropped within a year of Tales of Berseria, Dragon Quest XI, Persona 5, Nioh, Octopath Traveler, and Nier Automata, all of which contributed to a huge wave of quality Japanese games.

312
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:20,200
While the article holds up Western indie garbage like Yik as progress in JRPGs, and the entire thing is about millennial hipsters reliving their glory days.

313
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Yik is going to have to be its own video one day, because that rabbit hole is way too deep.

314
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:36,200
But just to give you a taste, a good chunk of the game has the characters break the fourth wall to talk about the developers' other games in a way that makes clear that the developers really wanted those games to be their big breakaway hit, not Yik.

315
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,200
And this is what's really at the core of this conversation. Frankly, it's what's at the core of a lot of the gaming-centric videos I do on this channel.

316
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,200
If you're in your 30s like I am, hell for some of you even in your 20s, back when you were young, you were probably picked on for enjoying video games.

317
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
You were the nerdy kid that the popular boys beat up and the girls laughed at.

318
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,200
If you were a gamer girl, the popular girls probably beat you up, and the boys probably thought you were a poser.

319
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,200
For all of us, graduation was basically a relief. We could all move away and put these people safely in the rearview mirror.

320
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,200
But that's not how it turned out. All of these game journos, these progressive indie developers, they're all cut from the same cloth as the old bullies.

321
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Now that gaming's popular and not just for nerds, they want a piece of the pie.

322
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,200
They want to say that they were always the real fans, the legitimate voice of what is in gaming.

323
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,200
And now that progressive politics are also popular, they want to forget everything in their past that they actually did.

324
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:31,200
From edgy humor, to racism, to bullying Japanese developers for being too Japanese, to bullying fans for liking Japanese games or games at all.

325
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Look at Elden Ring. It's made by a Japanese company, and it's an RPG. Would we call it a JRPG? Well, probably not.

326
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,200
JRPGs as a genre came about due to adapting D&D conventions to hardware limitations, creating new conventions as a result.

327
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Elden Ring has more in common with other open-world Western RPGs, where you can build your character how you like, customize your leveling experience, explore the world in any direction.

328
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,200
The combat is all Souls-like, of course. It's not turn-based. But no RPGs are turn-based anymore.

329
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Mass Effect is a third-person shooter. Fallout is a first-person shooter. Top-down isometric games are all real-time now.

330
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,200
The only games that are still turn-based are either grand strategy games or developers appealing to old harbor limitations again.

331
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Like how Sea of Stars is cut from the cloth of Chrono Trigger, or how Octopath Traveler feels like Final Fantasy 6 made 3D.

332
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:19,200
But even though Elden Ring is not a JRPG, it still received a lot of unwarranted backlash from game journals when it came out.

333
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,200
They were crying about how it's a bigoted game because it's not inclusive enough because it's hard.

334
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Souls-like combat is notoriously hard. That's the whole point. But look at the circle that we've come around.

335
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:42,200
These people back in the day were shitting on Japanese game developers in a pretty racist way because they were still making turn-based RPGs and doing anime-style storylines in an era where Western developers were moving all of their RPGs into the realm of shooters and action games and going for more grimdark bullshit.

336
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:56,200
That poor reaction, as well as lowering sales over time, of Japanese games led to Japanese developers to feel a stigma around their own creations to the point that Japanese developers have largely abandoned large swaths of what made them unique and interesting.

337
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Old beloved IPs like Mega Man and Castlevania are dead, and they seem to be never coming back.

338
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:08,200
The companies that own those IPs are now focusing almost exclusively on products that look like they're made by Western developers.

339
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Games that used to be JRPGs, like Final Fantasy, are now action-based shadows of their former selves because, as Yoshida put it, Japanese developers feel they are discriminated against based on the kinds of games that they make.

340
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:34,200
And the racist, progressive fucks who caused all of this are now, years later, screaming that games are too hard and Japanese developers are not inclusive enough, when it was their mockery that caused the abandonment of a genre that was uniquely Japanese and was frankly pretty easy to play.

341
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,200
For turn-based games, all you gotta do is navigate through a fucking menu.

342
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Game journalists and progressive indie developers are scumfucks. They are some of the worst, most hypocritical people you can bump into.

343
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:54,200
These people dare to claim some sort of a moral high ground when their racism, the very thing that they cancel people over today, caused the problem that they're complaining about right now. Fuck these people.

344
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Thanks for watching.
