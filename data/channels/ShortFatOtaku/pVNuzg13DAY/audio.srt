1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,780
You know, sometimes I don't edit out my own breaths on this channel, but it's always really

2
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,560
weird to hear them stacked up like that, eh?

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,480
Welcome everyone to TikTok Tuesday, coming out a little bit late.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,460
I know, I know, I just recorded like an hour's worth of stuff.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,140
It's gonna be a big video coming, so trust me, things are happening.

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,100
I'm not just being lazy playing Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, though I still kind of am

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,740
being lazy playing Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,540
Oh, and speaking of video games, I will be streaming some more of them tonight after

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,980
this goes up, so make sure you drop by and say hi.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,100
But for now, let's look at TikTok nonsense you guys have sent me today.

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,780
This is why public acceptance of gay people is declining.

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,260
Nobody in their right mind wants to be complete- The United Nations replaces all 193 country

13
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,740
flags with LGBT flags.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,900
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,540
Nobody in their right mind wants to be completely inundated with the pride flags for the month

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,220
of June, whether you are gay or straight.

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,580
We are all sick of it.

18
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,700
I don't need to see a pride flag to feel welcome in my country or to not feel oppressed.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,740
Do you know what this says to me?

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,620
Not that we're a marginalized community, in fact it says the opposite.

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,260
That we are a community that incessantly needs validation in order to feel welcome in society

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,100
because we're so insecure about ourselves.

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,100
True.

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,160
Is this something that you feel like you need every June?

25
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,600
Ask yourself why.

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,500
Is anybody in their right mind, gay or straight, doesn't need this or want it?

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,160
This is not equality.

28
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,460
This is privilege.

29
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,440
And I hate to break it to you, but true equality doesn't come with privilege.

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,880
So are we really fighting for equal rights or are we fighting for special treatment?

31
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,060
This is something I've heard a bunch of actually.

32
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,240
If you talk to let's say lesbians or gay people or bisexual people, they often tend to complain,

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,120
usually behind closed doors because you can't really say this in public, but they complain

34
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,840
that the T has taken over all the activism.

35
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,300
It's like, listen, people aren't getting fired for being gay, you know, they can date whoever

36
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,360
they want, they're not getting sharey a lot, at least not yet.

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,240
They can get gay married, you know, like legally things are pretty good.

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,940
So a lot of the L, G and B people, they don't really see the problem.

39
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,320
And you can make some arguments as to whether or not trans people are actually oppressed.

40
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,620
In fact, there's some very good arguments that they are.

41
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,920
The point is, like I said during my video on pride this year, everyone's done with it.

42
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,720
Even the normies don't want to have this shit pounded into their head anymore.

43
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
It's gotten old.

44
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,920
Stop it bro, I'm on break!

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,360
You fucking dumbass, I'm on break!

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,520
You going to fight bro, you don't even know who I am.

47
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Then why are you behind the counter?

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
Go to the break room.

49
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,520
I don't want to do anything wrong to you.

50
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Why is he yelling?

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
And then I offer you, you want to play football?

52
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
So look, let me talk.

53
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
No, just tell me what I did wrong.

54
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Can I talk?

55
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Can I talk?

56
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
You're coming at me bro.

57
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
No, can I talk?

58
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
I'm giving up sleep.

59
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Oh god, Zoomers.

60
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
The Zoomers speak.

61
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,400
I'm going to fucking 6 in the morning.

62
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Why are you on my ass if I get a fucking 30 minute break?

63
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,080
Just so your fat ass can get pancakes and eggs, don't be fucked up bro, that's fucked

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
up.

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,080
It's a privilege, I ain't even working here at this fucking hour bro.

66
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,080
You're getting paid for, it's not a privilege.

67
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,080
It's fucking irrelevant if we're playing right now.

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
You're going to be fired tomorrow.

69
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,080
I don't care bro, I really don't care.

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Cause I didn't do nothing to you but come in here.

71
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
You're on the camera now bro.

72
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
Oh my god.

73
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,080
You mad cause you yelling?

74
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Cameras have made people insane, I think.

75
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
So where's somebody else?

76
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
So if you on break.

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
You just said it.

78
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
If you on break.

79
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
You just said it bro.

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,760
If you on break, where's somebody else?

81
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,760
You're making me mad on my break.

82
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
I'm not making you mad bro.

83
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,760
Cause you're saying like, oh why are you trying to refuse service, like that's fucking dumb,

84
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,760
this and that.

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Bro, I'm on break, I don't even have to.

86
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
Okay, you telling me you sent.

87
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
Oh yeah bro.

88
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,760
For the fact that I even asked you to take a moment bro.

89
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Your boss don't see this in the morning.

90
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
It's fucking crazy bro.

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
Your boss don't see this in the morning.

92
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
Bro, I don't care bro.

93
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
That's what I don't think.

94
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,760
Just walk out if you don't care, like just peace.

95
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,760
I am working 10pm shift to 6 in the morning.

96
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,760
You think I want to work this job bro?

97
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:54,240
We're missing a lot of context here, but it really feels like, just the act of pulling

98
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,360
out a phone or pulling out a camera in 2023, massively escalates every situation.

99
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,040
Because everyone knows, not to just constantly be referring back to my other videos, that

100
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,760
was what my nostalgia as fascism video was about.

101
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,760
That back in the day, you pull out a camera, everyone's having a good time.

102
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,120
Nowadays, everyone's on edge.

103
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,960
They're all scared they're going to be the next viral hit.

104
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,120
And I don't mean anything positive when I say hit there.

105
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,960
I think this guy actually ended up getting fired for this.

106
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,680
And as far as I can tell, the dispute was probably pretty reasonable.

107
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,960
Like he is the only person at IHOP doing 10pm to 6am.

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,920
It is a shitty shift.

109
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Night shift sucks.

110
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
I've done it myself.

111
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,560
And he's on his 30 minute break, which is his right.

112
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,400
And someone comes in and is like, yo, make me food.

113
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
He's like, I can't make you food.

114
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
I'm on a 30 minute break.

115
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
No one else in the store.

116
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
You got away.

117
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
That's just how it is.

118
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,440
There's one person in the store and you're on your break, that store shut down until

119
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
you're done your break.

120
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
That's just how it is, man.

121
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,480
So like the customer probably wanted his food.

122
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
That's reasonable.

123
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
The guy probably wanted his break.

124
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
That's also reasonable.

125
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,080
But I think it's the presence of the phone, of the fact that this got uploaded to TikTok

126
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,440
anyway, and that it went viral and that they knew what was going to happen.

127
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,600
That probably escalated the entire encounter.

128
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,000
And speaking of restaurants, look at this.

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,600
They're just doing it during a flood.

130
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,780
Like now that's the complete opposite situation.

131
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,560
They're hyper committed to their job.

132
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,620
I'd be out of there.

133
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,780
This was a really nice notebook until this happened.

134
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,780
What's going on?

135
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,780
If Malaysia was anime, COVID ball, it's allowed.

136
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,780
You really made me write my name in the fucking Death Note?

137
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,620
I hope that that video clip doesn't get the channel nuked.

138
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,220
At one point, we actually had plans like this is way back during the anime review days of

139
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
the channel.

140
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,300
We had plans to do like a Death Note review.

141
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,660
And I think we actually have somewhere an actual Death Note, just like a prop that we

142
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,660
ended up not using.

143
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,420
I still like Death Note, but I mean, the anime reviews weren't making the money.

144
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,080
The gaming stuff makes some money.

145
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,620
The politics stuff makes a lot of money.

146
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,420
So had to scrap it.

147
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,660
Actually, I'm just kind of curious, if you do want to see like the SFO anime review come

148
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,020
back, post something in the comments, I'm kind of curious to see if there's any interest

149
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,020
in that.

150
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:22,020
That was just some kind of a show?

151
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,020
Is he going to jump into the crowd?

152
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,020
Oh, they're saying no, the crowd's saying no, don't do it.

153
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,020
Yeah!

154
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,020
Holy shit!

155
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:39,220
They just like parted like the Red Sea and let him go head first into the ground.

156
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,220
Oh my God.

157
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,460
You know, I never understood the whole crowd surfing thing.

158
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,140
I know that there's a there's a stereotype of it.

159
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,140
Did people actually do that?

160
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,820
Like, did rock stars actually get crowds to carry them around?

161
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,940
Was it was it always like all the brown people holding Daenerys up?

162
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,260
What are they?

163
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,940
They were once men.

164
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:06,420
Hold on, hold on, what did that say?

165
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,420
People watching the WNBA in 2030.

166
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,500
Oh, God, they were once men.

167
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,620
That's terrible.

168
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,580
That's amazing, but terrible.

169
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,620
I think I mentioned this one in a previous TikTok Tuesday where I was talking about the

170
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,620
guy who bit the metal.

171
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,180
I said this is like another example of a really funny TikTok that's kind of been lost.

172
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,180
Well, someone sent it to me.

173
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,180
It's not that lost.

174
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,180
What?

175
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,180
What the fuck?

176
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,180
What the fuck?

177
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
Am I watching?

178
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:41,460
They're just partying with a monkey?

179
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,460
What the fuck?

180
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,460
Okay.

181
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,460
For white girls, it's dog-pilled.

182
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,860
For black girls, it's it's literally monkey-pilled.

183
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,860
Is that where we are?

184
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,900
I wish I understood the human race, guys.

185
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Okay.

186
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,900
Okay.

187
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,900
This isn't like full shade towards you.

188
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,460
I just see a lot of comments like this and this was the most recent one, so I'm just

189
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,980
responding to this one.

190
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
What's the comment here?

191
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,780
I don't blame you for not trusting white people.

192
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,780
I'm white.

193
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,780
I don't even know if they're white people.

194
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,780
Jesus.

195
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,160
When white people say shit like this, it isn't the serve they think it is.

196
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,660
Like you're a part of the problem.

197
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
Fix your people, bro.

198
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,660
What the fuck?

199
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:16,220
Like when white people are like, I'm white, and white people do suck, yeah, you're probably

200
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,380
a part of those said white people, so do something about it.

201
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,380
The fuck?

202
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,380
Don't worry.

203
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,380
You're pretty shit too, lady.

204
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,380
Also, I hate when white people try to validate me.

205
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,700
Like, they're literally like, I'm white, but I agree, bro.

206
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,580
I don't know if you noticed, but I don't need validation from white people.

207
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,500
Like, that's the last thing I need in my life.

208
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,280
Like, I feel like white people always try, but they miss, like, and I feel bad for y'all.

209
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,300
Not that bad, though, because your ancestors suck and you're stinky and evil, but bad enough

210
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,860
where I want to call you out and tell you not to leave comments like this because it's

211
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,860
crusty.

212
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,420
Anyways, all the bleached demons willing to learn, you're not as bad as the rest.

213
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,300
Listen, they keep inventing all these slurs for white people.

214
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,500
Look at what they have to do to mimic a fraction of our power.

215
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,020
This person's actually just a racist, like, she's legitimately a disgusting human being,

216
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,820
but it's funny how she's like, I don't need validation from white people.

217
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,820
Okay, fuck it.

218
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,780
No white person should ever chill with you again or give you, or like, give your ideas

219
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,780
any credence.

220
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,780
So you're racist.

221
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,780
No, we're not.

222
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,780
Fuck you.

223
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,780
Fuck off.

224
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,820
If they're actually going to slap the hand of reconciliation, why should anyone stick

225
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,900
it out at them?

226
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Fuck these people.

227
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,900
Oh, this next one I think is really interesting because this is a trans man who said that

228
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,500
as a man, he now gets way less privileged than he used to as a woman.

229
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,940
I think that's what this is.

230
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,940
Nobody told me how lonely being a man is.

231
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:48,400
I had closer friendships with random women I met in the bathroom before I transitioned

232
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,700
at clubs because of how open women are than I've had.

233
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:02,220
And I had eight years of transitioning because women are just so much more vulnerable and

234
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,580
deep than men.

235
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,580
But to have known, and I think a lot of trans men feel this, is we knew what depth felt

236
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,040
like before we transitioned.

237
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,420
We knew what it felt like to, like, have people want to hug us.

238
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,260
And I have multiple feelings about this already.

239
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,260
Talk to us.

240
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,740
We all wait until this is done.

241
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,640
And then you transition and you're just a guy walking down the street that people cross

242
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,860
the street so that they're not near you.

243
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,420
And friendships are so much harder to build.

244
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,220
And people are colder.

245
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:43,180
What's hard is none of this invalidates how real and raw women and people who are in marginalized

246
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,600
groups feel about cis white men.

247
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,660
All of that's valid.

248
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:56,260
But I also now understand why the suicide rate is so much higher in men because this

249
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,260
shit is lonely and I'm an emotionally mature man.

250
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,980
I know how to build friendships and it is still really, really hard.

251
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,820
There's a few things going on here.

252
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:13,180
One there was back in the 2000s, there was that famous documentary where a woman cross

253
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,060
dressed as a man to see what it was like to truly have male privilege and then came out

254
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,740
of the experience as a men's rights activist because she was treated so much worse as a

255
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,740
man than as a woman.

256
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,740
That's true.

257
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
Definitely.

258
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,260
Unless you are like the top 1% of men, unless you are the top of your field, you have tons

259
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,940
of money, you have amazing looks or something, you're generally treated like shit by most

260
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
of society.

261
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,700
And there is a loneliness to it and there is absolutely reasons why the male suicide

262
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,020
rate is so high.

263
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,420
But also I have to wonder because this person's a trans man, meaning that they're biologically

264
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,980
female, I have to wonder if there is something in the trans man experience that is fundamentally

265
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,760
missing of the cis man one.

266
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,740
Because we've all seen that video of Henry Cavill immediately becoming friends with one

267
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,860
of his co-stars or something, simply because they both like Warhammer and the girls in

268
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,260
the room chuckled like T.E.

269
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,260
Men.

270
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,260
That's how men build real friendships.

271
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,740
It's like, oh, they have one common interest, we don't need to know anything else.

272
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:15,060
That's why you see memes about men grilling or men building holes, dudes posting their

273
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:21,780
wins as an account just full of male bonding over honestly just random stuff.

274
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,300
But that's how men are, you know?

275
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,940
They bond over activities.

276
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,300
When they get mad, they fight and then they're friends again.

277
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,100
Like there are certain masculine aspects to this that I wonder if because this person's

278
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,780
a trans man and not a cis man, he just doesn't get.

279
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,380
Because it actually is pretty easy making friends with other men.

280
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,740
It's just not in the, what he describes as deep, spiritual, emotional, womanly way that

281
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
this person describes.

282
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,100
Though I wouldn't necessarily call men shallow, which is kind of the implication here.

283
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

284
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Oh yeah.

285
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Dude.

286
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:09,340
That's fucking, I gotta like go dig my dream cast out or something now.

287
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,340
That's fucking awesome.

288
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,820
When I was a kid, I always wanted the Sonic soap shoes just so I could do that.

289
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,820
It always seemed cool, but like looking at it again, it looks a little bit strange, doesn't

290
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,820
it?

291
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,380
Maybe just the angular or something, but it's not nearly as cool as like pulling off a skateboard

292
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,380
trick or something.

293
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,380
Oh well.

294
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,380
Childhood ruined.

295
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,700
All right, my friends, that'll about do it for me.

296
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,860
Thanks for being here.

297
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,940
Keep sending me this garbage and I'll keep making these.

298
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,260
I'll keep making these.

299
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,060
I'll see you next time, okay?

300
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,180
Oh, and come by the stream tonight.

301
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,420
We're playing Star Wars.

302
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,340
I'll be dressed up as a fat Luke Skywalker.

303
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,860
It's going to be a fun time.

304
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,020
You can make fun of me all you want.

305
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,020
Okay, I'll see you there, guys.

306
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,780
I love you.
