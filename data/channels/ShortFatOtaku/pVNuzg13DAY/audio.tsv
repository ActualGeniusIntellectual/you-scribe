0	10780	You know, sometimes I don't edit out my own breaths on this channel, but it's always really
10780	13560	weird to hear them stacked up like that, eh?
13560	17480	Welcome everyone to TikTok Tuesday, coming out a little bit late.
17480	22460	I know, I know, I just recorded like an hour's worth of stuff.
22460	26140	It's gonna be a big video coming, so trust me, things are happening.
26140	30100	I'm not just being lazy playing Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, though I still kind of am
30100	31740	being lazy playing Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.
31740	34540	Oh, and speaking of video games, I will be streaming some more of them tonight after
34540	36980	this goes up, so make sure you drop by and say hi.
36980	42100	But for now, let's look at TikTok nonsense you guys have sent me today.
42100	45780	This is why public acceptance of gay people is declining.
45780	50260	Nobody in their right mind wants to be complete- The United Nations replaces all 193 country
50260	51740	flags with LGBT flags.
51740	53900	Okay, yeah, that makes sense.
53900	57540	Nobody in their right mind wants to be completely inundated with the pride flags for the month
57540	60220	of June, whether you are gay or straight.
60220	61580	We are all sick of it.
61580	65700	I don't need to see a pride flag to feel welcome in my country or to not feel oppressed.
65700	67740	Do you know what this says to me?
67740	71620	Not that we're a marginalized community, in fact it says the opposite.
71620	76260	That we are a community that incessantly needs validation in order to feel welcome in society
76260	78100	because we're so insecure about ourselves.
78100	79100	True.
79100	82160	Is this something that you feel like you need every June?
82160	83600	Ask yourself why.
83600	88500	Is anybody in their right mind, gay or straight, doesn't need this or want it?
88500	90160	This is not equality.
90160	91460	This is privilege.
91460	94440	And I hate to break it to you, but true equality doesn't come with privilege.
94440	97880	So are we really fighting for equal rights or are we fighting for special treatment?
97880	101060	This is something I've heard a bunch of actually.
101060	106240	If you talk to let's say lesbians or gay people or bisexual people, they often tend to complain,
106240	110120	usually behind closed doors because you can't really say this in public, but they complain
110120	112840	that the T has taken over all the activism.
112880	117300	It's like, listen, people aren't getting fired for being gay, you know, they can date whoever
117300	120360	they want, they're not getting sharey a lot, at least not yet.
120360	124240	They can get gay married, you know, like legally things are pretty good.
124240	127940	So a lot of the L, G and B people, they don't really see the problem.
127940	131320	And you can make some arguments as to whether or not trans people are actually oppressed.
131320	133620	In fact, there's some very good arguments that they are.
133620	138920	The point is, like I said during my video on pride this year, everyone's done with it.
138920	142720	Even the normies don't want to have this shit pounded into their head anymore.
142720	143720	It's gotten old.
143720	145920	Stop it bro, I'm on break!
145920	149360	You fucking dumbass, I'm on break!
149360	151520	You going to fight bro, you don't even know who I am.
151520	152520	Then why are you behind the counter?
152520	153520	Go to the break room.
153520	154520	I don't want to do anything wrong to you.
154520	155520	Why is he yelling?
155520	157520	And then I offer you, you want to play football?
157520	158520	So look, let me talk.
158520	159520	No, just tell me what I did wrong.
159520	160520	Can I talk?
160520	161520	Can I talk?
161520	162520	You're coming at me bro.
162520	163520	No, can I talk?
163520	164520	I'm giving up sleep.
164520	165520	Oh god, Zoomers.
165520	166520	The Zoomers speak.
166520	168400	I'm going to fucking 6 in the morning.
168400	171400	Why are you on my ass if I get a fucking 30 minute break?
171400	175080	Just so your fat ass can get pancakes and eggs, don't be fucked up bro, that's fucked
175080	176080	up.
176080	179080	It's a privilege, I ain't even working here at this fucking hour bro.
179080	183080	You're getting paid for, it's not a privilege.
183080	184080	It's fucking irrelevant if we're playing right now.
184080	185080	You're going to be fired tomorrow.
185080	186080	I don't care bro, I really don't care.
186080	187080	Cause I didn't do nothing to you but come in here.
187080	188080	You're on the camera now bro.
188080	189080	Oh my god.
189080	194080	You mad cause you yelling?
194080	196080	Cameras have made people insane, I think.
196080	197080	So where's somebody else?
197080	198080	So if you on break.
198080	199080	You just said it.
199080	200080	If you on break.
200080	201080	You just said it bro.
201760	202760	If you on break, where's somebody else?
202760	203760	You're making me mad on my break.
203760	204760	I'm not making you mad bro.
204760	208760	Cause you're saying like, oh why are you trying to refuse service, like that's fucking dumb,
208760	209760	this and that.
209760	210760	Bro, I'm on break, I don't even have to.
210760	211760	Okay, you telling me you sent.
211760	212760	Oh yeah bro.
212760	214760	For the fact that I even asked you to take a moment bro.
214760	216760	Your boss don't see this in the morning.
216760	217760	It's fucking crazy bro.
217760	218760	Your boss don't see this in the morning.
218760	219760	Bro, I don't care bro.
219760	220760	That's what I don't think.
220760	222760	Just walk out if you don't care, like just peace.
222760	225760	I am working 10pm shift to 6 in the morning.
225760	227760	You think I want to work this job bro?
228440	234240	We're missing a lot of context here, but it really feels like, just the act of pulling
234240	240360	out a phone or pulling out a camera in 2023, massively escalates every situation.
240360	244040	Because everyone knows, not to just constantly be referring back to my other videos, that
244040	246760	was what my nostalgia as fascism video was about.
246760	249760	That back in the day, you pull out a camera, everyone's having a good time.
249760	252120	Nowadays, everyone's on edge.
252120	253960	They're all scared they're going to be the next viral hit.
253960	256120	And I don't mean anything positive when I say hit there.
256480	258960	I think this guy actually ended up getting fired for this.
258960	261680	And as far as I can tell, the dispute was probably pretty reasonable.
261680	264960	Like he is the only person at IHOP doing 10pm to 6am.
264960	266920	It is a shitty shift.
266920	267920	Night shift sucks.
267920	268920	I've done it myself.
268920	271560	And he's on his 30 minute break, which is his right.
271560	273400	And someone comes in and is like, yo, make me food.
273400	274400	He's like, I can't make you food.
274400	275400	I'm on a 30 minute break.
275400	276400	No one else in the store.
276400	277400	You got away.
277400	278400	That's just how it is.
278400	281440	There's one person in the store and you're on your break, that store shut down until
281440	282440	you're done your break.
282440	283440	That's just how it is, man.
283440	285480	So like the customer probably wanted his food.
285840	286840	That's reasonable.
286840	287840	The guy probably wanted his break.
287840	288840	That's also reasonable.
288840	293080	But I think it's the presence of the phone, of the fact that this got uploaded to TikTok
293080	296440	anyway, and that it went viral and that they knew what was going to happen.
296440	298600	That probably escalated the entire encounter.
298600	302000	And speaking of restaurants, look at this.
302000	307600	They're just doing it during a flood.
307600	309780	Like now that's the complete opposite situation.
309780	311560	They're hyper committed to their job.
311560	312620	I'd be out of there.
312780	314780	This was a really nice notebook until this happened.
319780	321780	What's going on?
321780	325780	If Malaysia was anime, COVID ball, it's allowed.
337780	340780	You really made me write my name in the fucking Death Note?
340940	345620	I hope that that video clip doesn't get the channel nuked.
345620	349220	At one point, we actually had plans like this is way back during the anime review days of
349220	350220	the channel.
350220	352300	We had plans to do like a Death Note review.
352300	356660	And I think we actually have somewhere an actual Death Note, just like a prop that we
356660	357660	ended up not using.
357660	361420	I still like Death Note, but I mean, the anime reviews weren't making the money.
361420	363080	The gaming stuff makes some money.
363080	364620	The politics stuff makes a lot of money.
364620	366420	So had to scrap it.
366420	370660	Actually, I'm just kind of curious, if you do want to see like the SFO anime review come
370660	374020	back, post something in the comments, I'm kind of curious to see if there's any interest
374020	375020	in that.
375020	382020	That was just some kind of a show?
382020	384020	Is he going to jump into the crowd?
384020	389020	Oh, they're saying no, the crowd's saying no, don't do it.
389020	390020	Yeah!
390020	391020	Holy shit!
391020	399220	They just like parted like the Red Sea and let him go head first into the ground.
399220	401220	Oh my God.
401220	403460	You know, I never understood the whole crowd surfing thing.
403460	405140	I know that there's a there's a stereotype of it.
405140	406140	Did people actually do that?
406140	408820	Like, did rock stars actually get crowds to carry them around?
408820	412940	Was it was it always like all the brown people holding Daenerys up?
412940	416260	What are they?
416260	419940	They were once men.
419940	426420	Hold on, hold on, what did that say?
426420	430420	People watching the WNBA in 2030.
430420	435500	Oh, God, they were once men.
435500	436620	That's terrible.
436620	438580	That's amazing, but terrible.
438580	443620	I think I mentioned this one in a previous TikTok Tuesday where I was talking about the
443620	444620	guy who bit the metal.
444620	448180	I said this is like another example of a really funny TikTok that's kind of been lost.
448180	449180	Well, someone sent it to me.
449180	450180	It's not that lost.
450180	451180	What?
451180	452180	What the fuck?
452180	453180	What the fuck?
453180	454180	Am I watching?
454180	461460	They're just partying with a monkey?
461460	462460	What the fuck?
462460	463460	Okay.
463460	464460	For white girls, it's dog-pilled.
464460	466860	For black girls, it's it's literally monkey-pilled.
466860	467860	Is that where we are?
467860	469900	I wish I understood the human race, guys.
469900	470900	Okay.
470900	471900	Okay.
471900	472900	This isn't like full shade towards you.
472900	475460	I just see a lot of comments like this and this was the most recent one, so I'm just
475460	476980	responding to this one.
476980	477980	What's the comment here?
478180	480780	I don't blame you for not trusting white people.
480780	481780	I'm white.
481780	482780	I don't even know if they're white people.
482780	483780	Jesus.
483780	487160	When white people say shit like this, it isn't the serve they think it is.
487160	488660	Like you're a part of the problem.
488660	489660	Fix your people, bro.
489660	490660	What the fuck?
490660	496220	Like when white people are like, I'm white, and white people do suck, yeah, you're probably
496220	499380	a part of those said white people, so do something about it.
499380	500380	The fuck?
500380	501380	Don't worry.
501380	502380	You're pretty shit too, lady.
502380	503380	Also, I hate when white people try to validate me.
503380	507700	Like, they're literally like, I'm white, but I agree, bro.
507700	510580	I don't know if you noticed, but I don't need validation from white people.
510580	512500	Like, that's the last thing I need in my life.
512500	519280	Like, I feel like white people always try, but they miss, like, and I feel bad for y'all.
519280	524300	Not that bad, though, because your ancestors suck and you're stinky and evil, but bad enough
524300	528860	where I want to call you out and tell you not to leave comments like this because it's
528860	529860	crusty.
529860	535420	Anyways, all the bleached demons willing to learn, you're not as bad as the rest.
535420	539300	Listen, they keep inventing all these slurs for white people.
539300	542500	Look at what they have to do to mimic a fraction of our power.
542500	547020	This person's actually just a racist, like, she's legitimately a disgusting human being,
547020	549820	but it's funny how she's like, I don't need validation from white people.
549820	550820	Okay, fuck it.
550820	554780	No white person should ever chill with you again or give you, or like, give your ideas
554780	555780	any credence.
555780	556780	So you're racist.
556780	557780	No, we're not.
557780	558780	Fuck you.
558780	559780	Fuck off.
559780	562820	If they're actually going to slap the hand of reconciliation, why should anyone stick
562820	563900	it out at them?
563900	564900	Fuck these people.
564900	570900	Oh, this next one I think is really interesting because this is a trans man who said that
570900	575500	as a man, he now gets way less privileged than he used to as a woman.
575500	577940	I think that's what this is.
577940	582940	Nobody told me how lonely being a man is.
582940	588400	I had closer friendships with random women I met in the bathroom before I transitioned
588400	594700	at clubs because of how open women are than I've had.
594700	602220	And I had eight years of transitioning because women are just so much more vulnerable and
602220	604580	deep than men.
604580	609580	But to have known, and I think a lot of trans men feel this, is we knew what depth felt
609580	611040	like before we transitioned.
611040	616420	We knew what it felt like to, like, have people want to hug us.
616420	618260	And I have multiple feelings about this already.
618260	619260	Talk to us.
619260	621740	We all wait until this is done.
621780	625640	And then you transition and you're just a guy walking down the street that people cross
625640	629860	the street so that they're not near you.
629860	634420	And friendships are so much harder to build.
634420	636220	And people are colder.
636220	643180	What's hard is none of this invalidates how real and raw women and people who are in marginalized
643180	646600	groups feel about cis white men.
646600	649660	All of that's valid.
649660	656260	But I also now understand why the suicide rate is so much higher in men because this
656260	661260	shit is lonely and I'm an emotionally mature man.
661260	665980	I know how to build friendships and it is still really, really hard.
665980	667820	There's a few things going on here.
667820	673180	One there was back in the 2000s, there was that famous documentary where a woman cross
673180	678060	dressed as a man to see what it was like to truly have male privilege and then came out
678060	681740	of the experience as a men's rights activist because she was treated so much worse as a
681740	682740	man than as a woman.
682740	683740	That's true.
683740	684740	Definitely.
684740	689260	Unless you are like the top 1% of men, unless you are the top of your field, you have tons
689260	693940	of money, you have amazing looks or something, you're generally treated like shit by most
693940	694940	of society.
694940	698700	And there is a loneliness to it and there is absolutely reasons why the male suicide
698700	700020	rate is so high.
700020	705420	But also I have to wonder because this person's a trans man, meaning that they're biologically
705420	710980	female, I have to wonder if there is something in the trans man experience that is fundamentally
710980	712760	missing of the cis man one.
712760	717740	Because we've all seen that video of Henry Cavill immediately becoming friends with one
717740	721860	of his co-stars or something, simply because they both like Warhammer and the girls in
721860	723260	the room chuckled like T.E.
723260	724260	Men.
724260	725260	That's how men build real friendships.
725260	728740	It's like, oh, they have one common interest, we don't need to know anything else.
728740	735060	That's why you see memes about men grilling or men building holes, dudes posting their
735940	741780	wins as an account just full of male bonding over honestly just random stuff.
741780	743300	But that's how men are, you know?
743300	744940	They bond over activities.
744940	747300	When they get mad, they fight and then they're friends again.
747300	752100	Like there are certain masculine aspects to this that I wonder if because this person's
752100	755780	a trans man and not a cis man, he just doesn't get.
755780	759380	Because it actually is pretty easy making friends with other men.
759380	765740	It's just not in the, what he describes as deep, spiritual, emotional, womanly way that
765740	766740	this person describes.
766740	770100	Though I wouldn't necessarily call men shallow, which is kind of the implication here.
770100	772100	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
772100	774100	Oh yeah.
774100	775100	Dude.
775100	789340	That's fucking, I gotta like go dig my dream cast out or something now.
789340	790340	That's fucking awesome.
790340	793820	When I was a kid, I always wanted the Sonic soap shoes just so I could do that.
793820	797820	It always seemed cool, but like looking at it again, it looks a little bit strange, doesn't
797820	798820	it?
798820	801380	Maybe just the angular or something, but it's not nearly as cool as like pulling off a skateboard
801380	802380	trick or something.
802380	803380	Oh well.
803380	804380	Childhood ruined.
804380	806700	All right, my friends, that'll about do it for me.
806700	807860	Thanks for being here.
807860	810940	Keep sending me this garbage and I'll keep making these.
810940	814260	I'll keep making these.
814260	816060	I'll see you next time, okay?
816060	818180	Oh, and come by the stream tonight.
818180	819420	We're playing Star Wars.
819420	821340	I'll be dressed up as a fat Luke Skywalker.
821340	822860	It's going to be a fun time.
822860	824020	You can make fun of me all you want.
824020	825020	Okay, I'll see you there, guys.
825020	825780	I love you.
