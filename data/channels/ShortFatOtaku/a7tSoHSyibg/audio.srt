1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Yes, I've made my way over to Brightion. That's Brightion.com channels slash short

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,160
fat otaku. I don't think you can actually do it without the channels like if you just did

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,120
Brightion.com slash short fat otaku. Yeah, it gives you a 404. All right, I'm pretty sure if

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,960
you just search short fat otaku, you'll find me though. Let's see. Yeah, there's all my videos

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,160
right there. Okay, I'm on Brightion. That is another alt tech site another another YouTube

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,560
alternative. I've been uploading videos to that platform on the SFO channel over there. As you

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,880
can see, there's a bunch of videos. But there's something different about this platform. As you

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,320
can see in my back end, it says you have been upgraded to new user, you can now upload 50

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,640
videos. So there's actually a limit on how many videos you can upload. And as you see,

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,880
there's a user level and video unlocks chart on this page here to upload unlimited videos,

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,800
I need a 20,000 views to upload 100 I need 1000. And all these levels are correlated by by 10

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,520
views a piece. So because I have around 500 videos to upload, I'll need 5000 views on this channel.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,400
So if for some reason you feel like watching my old content, please consider checking out my

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,760
Brightion channel. Because if you watch it there, that'll actually help me be able to upload the

15
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,720
rest of my backlog. I'm currently at 942 views on this channel. So another 60 or so and I'll be

16
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,520
able to upload the next set of videos. And if we get to 5000, I'll be able to upload all of them.

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,400
And like I said in my rumble video, once I have all of the SFO backlog uploaded to all of the

18
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,760
alt text sites that I wish to utilize, if I'm still not re monetized by then, I'll just come

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,240
back on a new channel with new content. So don't worry guys, I'm not gone forever. And of course,

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,280
if you miss me that much, there's always my twitch channel, twitch.tv slash game boomers last night,

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,360
we played cyberpunk. I played some some Pokemon fire red on a previous night. Here's Dave and

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,800
I playing Kirby's Dream Course. I'll be back there tonight. So drop by this twitch URL,

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,560
twitch.tv slash game boomers tonight, and I'll be there. So I'll see you tonight. I love you.
