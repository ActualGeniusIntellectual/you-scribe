Yes, I've made my way over to Brightion. That's Brightion.com channels slash short

00:06.800 --> 00:10.160
fat otaku. I don't think you can actually do it without the channels like if you just did

00:10.160 --> 00:15.120
Brightion.com slash short fat otaku. Yeah, it gives you a 404. All right, I'm pretty sure if

00:15.120 --> 00:20.960
you just search short fat otaku, you'll find me though. Let's see. Yeah, there's all my videos

00:20.960 --> 00:26.160
right there. Okay, I'm on Brightion. That is another alt tech site another another YouTube

00:26.160 --> 00:30.560
alternative. I've been uploading videos to that platform on the SFO channel over there. As you

00:30.560 --> 00:34.880
can see, there's a bunch of videos. But there's something different about this platform. As you

00:34.880 --> 00:40.320
can see in my back end, it says you have been upgraded to new user, you can now upload 50

00:40.320 --> 00:44.640
videos. So there's actually a limit on how many videos you can upload. And as you see,

00:44.640 --> 00:50.880
there's a user level and video unlocks chart on this page here to upload unlimited videos,

00:50.880 --> 00:56.800
I need a 20,000 views to upload 100 I need 1000. And all these levels are correlated by by 10

00:56.800 --> 01:03.520
views a piece. So because I have around 500 videos to upload, I'll need 5000 views on this channel.

01:03.520 --> 01:08.400
So if for some reason you feel like watching my old content, please consider checking out my

01:08.400 --> 01:13.760
Brightion channel. Because if you watch it there, that'll actually help me be able to upload the

01:13.760 --> 01:20.720
rest of my backlog. I'm currently at 942 views on this channel. So another 60 or so and I'll be

01:20.720 --> 01:25.520
able to upload the next set of videos. And if we get to 5000, I'll be able to upload all of them.

01:25.520 --> 01:32.400
And like I said in my rumble video, once I have all of the SFO backlog uploaded to all of the

01:32.400 --> 01:37.760
alt text sites that I wish to utilize, if I'm still not re monetized by then, I'll just come

01:37.760 --> 01:42.240
back on a new channel with new content. So don't worry guys, I'm not gone forever. And of course,

01:42.240 --> 01:47.280
if you miss me that much, there's always my twitch channel, twitch.tv slash game boomers last night,

01:47.600 --> 01:53.360
we played cyberpunk. I played some some Pokemon fire red on a previous night. Here's Dave and

01:53.360 --> 01:58.800
I playing Kirby's Dream Course. I'll be back there tonight. So drop by this twitch URL,

01:58.800 --> 02:04.560
twitch.tv slash game boomers tonight, and I'll be there. So I'll see you tonight. I love you.
