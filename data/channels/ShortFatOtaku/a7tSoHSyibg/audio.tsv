0	6800	Yes, I've made my way over to Brightion. That's Brightion.com channels slash short
6800	10160	fat otaku. I don't think you can actually do it without the channels like if you just did
10160	15120	Brightion.com slash short fat otaku. Yeah, it gives you a 404. All right, I'm pretty sure if
15120	20960	you just search short fat otaku, you'll find me though. Let's see. Yeah, there's all my videos
20960	26160	right there. Okay, I'm on Brightion. That is another alt tech site another another YouTube
26160	30560	alternative. I've been uploading videos to that platform on the SFO channel over there. As you
30560	34880	can see, there's a bunch of videos. But there's something different about this platform. As you
34880	40320	can see in my back end, it says you have been upgraded to new user, you can now upload 50
40320	44640	videos. So there's actually a limit on how many videos you can upload. And as you see,
44640	50880	there's a user level and video unlocks chart on this page here to upload unlimited videos,
50880	56800	I need a 20,000 views to upload 100 I need 1000. And all these levels are correlated by by 10
56800	63520	views a piece. So because I have around 500 videos to upload, I'll need 5000 views on this channel.
63520	68400	So if for some reason you feel like watching my old content, please consider checking out my
68400	73760	Brightion channel. Because if you watch it there, that'll actually help me be able to upload the
73760	80720	rest of my backlog. I'm currently at 942 views on this channel. So another 60 or so and I'll be
80720	85520	able to upload the next set of videos. And if we get to 5000, I'll be able to upload all of them.
85520	92400	And like I said in my rumble video, once I have all of the SFO backlog uploaded to all of the
92400	97760	alt text sites that I wish to utilize, if I'm still not re monetized by then, I'll just come
97760	102240	back on a new channel with new content. So don't worry guys, I'm not gone forever. And of course,
102240	107280	if you miss me that much, there's always my twitch channel, twitch.tv slash game boomers last night,
107600	113360	we played cyberpunk. I played some some Pokemon fire red on a previous night. Here's Dave and
113360	118800	I playing Kirby's Dream Course. I'll be back there tonight. So drop by this twitch URL,
118800	124560	twitch.tv slash game boomers tonight, and I'll be there. So I'll see you tonight. I love you.
