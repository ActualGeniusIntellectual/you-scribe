1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,580
I have to come clean.

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,680
One big reason you haven't seen many videos from me is because The Legend of Zelda Tears

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,600
of the Kingdom came out and I've been doing nothing but playing that.

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,440
Now that's not the only reason, I've been doing a lot of E3 streams in the channel too.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,160
Yes, E3 is dead in that the actual event in LA with the booths on the show floor?

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,160
That was killed by COVID.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,240
But the E3 season still lives on in the minds of gamers, and the first half of June was

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,960
stuffed full of conferences by a bunch of game developers talking about what games are

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,920
coming up next, so I spent a lot of time doing prep and streaming those instead.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,060
But the lion's share has been me goofing off with Tears of the Kingdom, yes.

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,060
How could I not?

12
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,520
I love Zelda as a series, I love Breath of the Wild, the game that Tears of the Kingdom

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,320
is a direct sequel to, and I am fully obsessed with Link's latest adventure.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,120
I know that the Final Fantasy XVI demo was pretty awesome and Starfield also looks really

15
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,680
good, but I genuinely think that Zelda Tears of the Kingdom is going to win Game of the

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,680
Year 2023.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,260
It's pretty much the perfect storm of old and new.

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,320
Breath of the Wild saw Link waking up after 100 years of stasis with no memories, in a

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,280
completely desolate Kingdom of Hyrule.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,120
The various villages dotting the countryside had been destroyed, the great monuments to

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,940
Hyrule's royal family in ruins, Hyrule Castle, the seat of power of the entire country occupied

22
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,600
by Ganon's demon army.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,320
Those habited areas that did survive were under siege, or they were cursed, or they

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,740
had some other problem afflicting them.

25
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,300
The tone of Breath of the Wild is loneliness.

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,740
When you played that game, you felt truly alone.

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,140
But the theme of the game is rebuilding after loss.

28
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,640
Link is a hero out of time, and as you recover his memories, you begin to understand what

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
that means.

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,820
All of his friends are gone, well, most of them.

31
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,760
The Zora, the fish people, serve as the Zelda series' elves, being long-lived and building

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,300
ornate domains hidden away from human eyes.

33
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,140
And Prince Sidon was a child before Link was put to sleep, and he is now an adult.

34
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,720
Aside from him, though, everyone and everything is gone, and the majority of the game revolves

35
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,040
around Link's relationship with civilization as both familiar and outsider.

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,720
You can meet with the descendants of Link's old friends, help them with their struggles,

37
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
and watch them grow.

38
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,760
You can bring bandits to justice, and beat back Ganon's army from formerly-habited areas.

39
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,400
You can explore ancient ruins and learn the truth of the past.

40
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,620
Hell, if you want the theme of Breath of the Wild wrapped up in a tidy bow for you, it's

41
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,520
the questline where you found Tarrytown.

42
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,080
The site that Tarrytown eventually gets built on was weird to me the first time I encountered

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
it.

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,760
It had a goddess statue at the center, like all towns do, but nothing else.

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,540
As you do quests for Hudson, a hard-working entrepreneur, you eventually help him found

46
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,840
his construction company, and they will build Tarrytown from the ground up around that lonely

47
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,120
goddess statue.

48
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,680
Upon the completion of Hudson's questline, Tarrytown becomes emblematic of the overall

49
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,060
theme of Breath of the Wild, rebuilding after a great loss.

50
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,440
In a political sense, it's both conservative, as a new Link in the great ongoing chain of

51
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,160
civilization, no pun intended, and it's progressive, as Tarrytown is specifically made up of members

52
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,340
from each of Hyrule's tribes, Human, Zora, Rito, Goron, and Gerudo, and they each bring

53
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,020
their own culture and practices to Tarrytown.

54
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,800
Loss is a moment in which both progressives and conservatives have a role to play, the

55
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,400
creation of the future and the honoring of the past.

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,000
Tears of the Kingdom is a direct continuation of Breath of the Wild, both in terms of story

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
and in terms of theme.

58
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,640
Five years have passed and the land is gradually being resettled.

59
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,280
Tarrytown is a thriving hub of innovation, and Hudson's construction company is now

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,440
a vital part of rebuilding Hyrule.

61
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,000
Other new villages are slowly popping up again now that the threat is gone, or it was

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
gone.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,260
There's new problems to solve of course, it wouldn't be a Zelda game without villains

64
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,160
to fight, but Hyrule doesn't seem empty and deserted anymore.

65
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,120
It's under siege again, but this time people, normal people, not just heroes, are pushing

66
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,600
back against the threats.

67
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,560
This time the game feels optimistic, not desolate.

68
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,960
Like yes, things are pretty bad, but we can still do this.

69
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,520
Plus from a gameplay perspective, going back to old haunts is just a lot of fun.

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,280
Yeah, they added the sky islands and the underworld as two huge new locations you can visit, but

71
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,120
the surface world is the same as the Breath of the Wild map, with five years added onto

72
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
it.

73
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,760
Checking out how Tarrytown has grown, catching up with familiar faces from before, even remembering

74
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,660
noteworthy gameplay challenges like the Great Plateau or Eventide Island, and wondering

75
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,120
what's going on there now.

76
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,260
The world feels like it's grown as well, and if you love Breath of the Wild, Tears

77
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,060
of the Kingdom is full of those continuity moments that you've been waiting for.

78
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,200
Yes I know, my channel is not just a gaming channel.

79
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,120
I'm sure you're waiting for me to get to the point.

80
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,400
And also yes, I'm indulging myself a bit.

81
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,560
There's no other time I'd be able to gush about Tears of the Kingdom like this.

82
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,780
But okay, here's the point.

83
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,280
The reason the game is breaking sales records, and people are calling it the game of the

84
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,400
year, the best Zelda game ever, the best game of all time even, is because Nintendo actually

85
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,960
seems to care about the quality of their games, but also the quality of their franchises themselves.

86
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,240
Check out this article.

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,760
Developers agree that Zelda Tears of the Kingdom is a miracle.

88
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,780
What's going on here is that prominent Western developers like Josh Scherr, who worked as

89
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,940
Narrative Director on Naughty Dogs The Last of Us Part II, or Allison Lures, who worked

90
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,500
on Destiny 2, or Corey Brotherson, who worked for Sony before going indie, all expressed

91
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,780
shock and amazement at the stunning quality of Tears of the Kingdom.

92
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,700
Now I don't know what Corey Brotherson's actually done, and Destiny 2 has always been

93
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:02,180
mid ever since it was called Destiny 1, but I do know that The Last of Us Part II is universally

94
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,180
fan-panned.

95
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,620
It's a part of a long series of millennial-led media where established, beloved characters

96
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,000
and stories are brutally killed off or subverted by the new author's inserted favorite character

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,200
as a giant fuck you to the fans.

98
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,460
The creators of this new chapter in the story demand that fans side with their new focus,

99
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,580
when what tends to actually happen is that fans abandon the franchise for greener pastures.

100
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,680
Probably the most blatant example of what I'm talking about is the recent announcement

101
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,120
that Rey is coming back to Star Wars to rebuild the Jedi Order in a new series of movies,

102
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,100
which is exactly what Luke Skywalker's story should have been, and in fact was, before

103
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,560
Disney de-canonized the extended universe.

104
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,240
The message is clear, the new protectors of these properties, these universes, they want

105
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,740
the name, they want the icon, they want the status, they want the clout of those franchises,

106
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,960
but they want to use them as vehicles to tell their new stories rather than continue what

107
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,300
was laid down before.

108
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,480
Why is this?

109
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,020
Sometimes it's just hubris.

110
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,920
Sometimes though, it's to push a political message.

111
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,000
See my Antonio Gramsci video on that.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,440
But not so with Nintendo.

113
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,400
When they make a game, you're pretty much guaranteed to get what you expect, for better

114
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
or worse.

115
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,720
Usually better, though as a Nintendfag I'm biased.

116
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,920
Mario is always going to be about an Italian plumber running around a set of themed worlds,

117
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,000
creating blocks, getting power-ups, beating back Bowser's minions, and saving the princess.

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,240
Sometimes you'll use fire powers, and sometimes you'll ride a dinosaur friend, and sometimes

119
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,040
you'll jump into paintings, and sometimes you'll use a water pack, and sometimes you'll

120
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,480
go to outer space, and sometimes you can throw your hat to possess enemies, but the game

121
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,740
is fundamentally the same.

122
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,360
The restriction on the core formula allows the experimentation of the other aspects to

123
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
really stand out.

124
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,920
The Legend of Zelda as a series is the same way.

125
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,060
Nintendo changes things all the time, but never in a way that feels like a betrayal.

126
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,940
In Ocarina of Time you travel through time and try to change the future.

127
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,860
In Majora's Mask you wear masks that grant you new powers.

128
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,020
In Wind Waker the kingdom is flooded and you sail around the ocean on a ship.

129
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,800
In Twilight Princess you explore an alternate dimension known as the Twilight Realm, exposure

130
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,740
to which turns Link into a wolf, which furries absolutely loved.

131
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,140
In Skyward Sword the game takes place on floating islands and you zip around in the back of

132
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:58,700
a huge bird, but in each of them the core of what makes Zelda Zelda is present.

133
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,200
Link is a hero, Zelda is a princess, Ganon is present in some way, either as Ganondorf,

134
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,940
his mortal form as the King of the Gerudo, or as the Demon King himself.

135
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,500
These three eternal characters represent the three virtues of the Triforce, courage,

136
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,300
wisdom and power, and the relationship between the three plays out in an appropriate manner

137
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,300
every game.

138
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,520
The changes make the games fun, but the continuity makes the games meaningful.

139
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,300
Even in small ways there's a lot of continuity in fact.

140
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,420
Breath of the Wild saw players really fear the Lionel, the most dangerous of the Dark

141
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,900
Lord's ground forces.

142
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,680
Standing at about 20 feet tall, thousands of pounds of muscle, Lionel's have the lower

143
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,780
body of a horse, the upper body of a man and the head of a lion.

144
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,500
They carry some of the best equipment in the game, steel swords forged in the lava

145
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,240
of Death Mountain larger than any claymore, bows with metal drawstrings that no human

146
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,260
could possibly pull back, firing multiple short spears every shot.

147
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,980
They're ridiculously hard to defeat, and YouTube is filled with many a video of new

148
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,140
players accidentally finding one, freaking out and getting completely destroyed.

149
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:59,340
Taking down a Lionel is considered a true feat, both in the lore and among players.

150
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,340
And Lionel's got their start back in the original 1986 game as these little guys.

151
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,300
Doesn't exactly inspire fear, does it?

152
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,620
But it's the continuity that matters, knowing that that's what they were then and this

153
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,620
is what they are now.

154
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,980
Here's what I mean.

155
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,740
Moblins are these little pig-dog goblin monsters that have been in pretty much every game.

156
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,260
Even if you aren't a Zelda fan, if I show you this picture and say, this is a Moblin,

157
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,860
you can probably understand intuitively that he's a basic low-level soldier in Ganon's

158
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,860
army.

159
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,860
Nothing too scary.

160
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,360
That's how you know you're dealing with something iconic.

161
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,700
The context comes with the design.

162
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,600
Moblin is an Anglicization of the original Japanese term, Mori Burin.

163
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,880
This is a portmanteau of the Japanese word mori, which means forest, and goberin, which

164
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,160
is a Japanese pronunciation of the English word goblin.

165
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,120
So Moblin literally means forest goblin.

166
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,840
If you've ever played Japanese RPGs, have you noticed how their orcs are often pigmen

167
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,220
and their kobolds are often wolfmen?

168
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,360
Even though in the West, orcs are green-skinned barbarians and kobolds are lizardmen or sometimes

169
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,500
ratmen like in the case of Warcraft.

170
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,840
In my video about Yoshi-P a few months back, I talked about the history of Western-style

171
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,260
fantasy in Japan.

172
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,760
How the earliest Western fantasy games based off of D&D like Ultima and Wizardry were hugely

173
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,760
popular in Japan and how they heavily influenced the first Japanese fantasy games Dragon Quest

174
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
and Final Fantasy.

175
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,900
In D&D First Edition, things weren't exactly clear on what was supposed to be what.

176
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,040
For example, these are official First Edition orc miniatures showing them to have pig-like

177
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
features.

178
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,140
When Ultima and Wizardry were created, exactly what orcs and kobolds looked like hadn't been

179
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,940
cemented in D&D or in terms of the wider culture yet, and they went off of the earliest

180
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,060
depictions, which changed in the West over time.

181
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,900
Newer Western games used these newer depictions from newer versions of D&D, but Japanese fantasy

182
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,060
games are directly descended from Wizardry and Ultima, which both used the old designs.

183
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,780
Further complicating the matter is that orc and goblin are used interchangeably when talking

184
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,420
about the creatures in Lord of the Rings, which D&D was based off of.

185
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,460
Future fantasy properties would differentiate them, again most notably Warcraft, where goblins

186
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,460
are tiny green midgets that evolved from an animalistic state due to their contact

187
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,460
with a rare powerful material, while orcs are aliens from another planet that evolved

188
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,060
from rock giants getting infected by a weird hive-mind spore.

189
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,700
Yeah, Warcraft lore is weird.

190
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,000
But in Japan, since their entire Western fantasy canon came from Ultima and Wizardry, orcs

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,500
and goblins remained as interchangeable terms.

192
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,820
It also helped that in Japanese mythology, there was a creature called the Butato, a

193
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,120
barbarian pig-man who wore armor and used spears.

194
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,840
The Butato look very similar to the original depiction of orcs in the first edition of

195
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,960
D&D, which is why in the Zelda series, the Moblins, forest goblins, have pig-like qualities

196
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,440
and use spears, and why orcs in other Japanese games and anime are pig-men.

197
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,840
When I said that Moblins are iconic earlier, this is what I was getting at.

198
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,920
Both Western and Japanese players look at the Moblin and instantly see all of this context,

199
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,100
if only subconsciously, and they immediately get what they're all about.

200
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,040
The two different types of players are seeing the Moblin in a different cultural context,

201
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,800
but due to the convergence of factors, they're nonetheless pulling out more or less the same

202
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
information.

203
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,200
And this state of affairs persists across all of the Zelda games, across all of the

204
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,240
Moblin designs.

205
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,520
And not just Moblins, but Darknuts, Wizrobes, Stalfos, Wallmasters, they've all got a

206
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,160
detailed origin story that can be understood through simple intuition, and each iteration

207
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,280
builds on the previous all the way up to the present day.

208
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,960
This is how you know that Nintendo is masterclass at what they do, and that they truly care

209
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
about their games.

210
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,320
It's this continuity of meaning that drives people back to Nintendo's games time and

211
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,980
again, and Zelda games in particular, something that can only be built up through decades

212
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,980
of iteration.

213
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,460
And unlike with, say, The Last of Us Part II, they haven't sacrificed all of that

214
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,460
denseness and meaning to serve as a political message.

215
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,800
And I think it's that lack of a political message that drives Western progressives to

216
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,760
desperately try to overlay one.

217
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,660
A guy I follow on Twitter, Manlit Thorin, great name by the way, compared Nintendo Woman

218
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,380
to PlayStation Woman, showing the scientist Pura from Zelda, and Bayonetta from, well,

219
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,540
Bayonetta, versus Aloy from Horizon and Abby from The Last of Us Part II.

220
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,020
Funnily enough, Aloy was actually more attractive in the previous game, she's not a 10 out

221
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,660
of 10 or anything, but they're making a more realistic post-apocalyptic tribal game,

222
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
so fair enough.

223
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,600
But they actually hit her with the ugly stick for the sequel.

224
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,660
The point here is that Nintendo isn't afraid to put in attractive characters into their

225
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,660
games, even if they're in an anime style like Pura, while Sony is on this kick of

226
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
normalizing ugly characters.

227
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,660
This is just hilarious to me as a 90s kid, because back then it was the other way around.

228
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,980
Nintendo was very puritan about both sex and violence, while Sony was courting that edgy

229
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,100
90s crowd by leaning into exactly those things.

230
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,580
What's going on here is representation, a topic that I'm going to have to do a deep

231
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,580
dive on eventually.

232
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,540
Yes, Sargon, I picked up Pitkin's book on the subject, it's on the list.

233
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,380
Attractive women in media, like Pura or Bayonetta, are the norm.

234
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,480
Non-attractive women like Aloy or Abby aren't.

235
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,800
So in the name of equality, progressive logic insists that we should be normalizing non-attractive

236
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,280
women taking center stage.

237
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,320
The most recent video game related instance of this happening was Fable's reveal during

238
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,160
E3, and it went down about as you can expect.

239
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,520
Ugly female character went viral, fan artists made her more attractive, progressives shit

240
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,280
themselves over it.

241
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,400
Horizon and The Last of Us are made specifically with progressive politics in mind, at least

242
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
partially.

243
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,500
This is why people generally aren't running around on Twitter or Tumblr making up head

244
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,020
cannons or screaming about how everything is political and so these games must also

245
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
be political.

246
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,020
We already know that they are.

247
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,140
Frankly, it's why the libertarian gay romance at The Last of Us TV show didn't actually

248
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,540
bother non-leftists all that much, at least for the gay thing anyway.

249
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,540
The episode was actually a huge waste of time and didn't progress the story at all, but

250
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,100
we expected it because that's what The Last of Us is, because Bill and Frank were gay

251
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,580
in the original story.

252
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:37,240
However, because Bayonetta and Zelda aren't made with political themes in mind, you see

253
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,300
the Progs desperately trying to make them political.

254
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,720
I covered this article on a past Weekly Sip, so we don't need to go too much into detail

255
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
with it.

256
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,800
Plus, it's also really cancerous.

257
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,020
From our friends over at Polygon, Link is a gay icon and Zelda fans know it.

258
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,260
The Legend of Zelda's queer themes are more than just subtext.

259
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,980
This is the kind of article you write when a property doesn't actually have queer themes

260
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,700
and you desperately have to spin it as if it does, in order to bring it into the progressive

261
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,700
fold.

262
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,940
No one writes articles like this about Horizon or The Last of Us, because there's no work

263
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,740
to be done there to whitewash them as overtly woke.

264
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,080
They already are, but because Zelda is not, they have to make it so.

265
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,980
The examples given by the Progs are weak ones, of course.

266
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,300
Some people have tried to spin two side characters, a master archaeologist and his apprentice,

267
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,420
as being in a gay relationship, but that questline shows that while there's a lot of professional

268
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,740
admiration there, it's not romantic, and you really have to squint your eyes to make

269
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,380
the claim that this is the first gay character of the series.

270
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,420
Some fans and shippers have also paired up Link with the post-100 year slumber aged up

271
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,300
Prince Sidon due to their banter in Breath of the Wild.

272
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,060
But Tears of the Kingdom has us return to Hyrule to meet Sidon's fiancée, and the

273
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,140
Progs are not happy about it.

274
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,900
Listen, he's the prince of the Zora.

275
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,340
Why did you think he wasn't going to carry on his bloodline with a proper fish girl and

276
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,380
instead engage in a gay interspecies relationship?

277
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,340
And of course, Zelda's voice actress confirmed that Link and Zelda are, in fact, in a heterosexual

278
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,900
relationship this time around, which can be corroborated in-game.

279
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,340
In Breath of the Wild, you can actually save up and buy a house in Hateno Village.

280
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,740
If you return to that house in Tears of the Kingdom, you'll find signs that Link and

281
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,420
Zelda both live there together as a couple.

282
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,060
Not every game makes Link and Zelda's relationship explicitly romantic.

283
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,740
While they certainly are in Skyward Sword, in Wind Waker they're more like friends,

284
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,020
and in Twilight Princess, Link's romantic arc is clearly with Midna, the princess of

285
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,080
the Twilight Realm.

286
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,940
But this time around, in the Breath of the Wild continuity, they are officially together.

287
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,580
The most diehard fan theory, and the one that almost all of the online Link pornography

288
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,920
revolves around, is the idea that Link is gay or trans or both or something.

289
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,760
In Breath of the Wild, the Gerudo City is a woman-only location, as the Gerudo are a

290
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,300
woman-only species.

291
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,500
The women of other races are allowed in, but not the men.

292
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,940
Gorons are allowed in because they're gender neutral, even though most Gorons look pretty

293
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,940
masculine.

294
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,980
And one of the Gorons inside the city is actually really confused about the whole affair.

295
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,860
But Link has to go into the city as part of the main story, so you have the opportunity

296
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,620
to cross-dress.

297
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,660
Final Fantasy VII comedy has been a staple in Japanese entertainment for as long as I

298
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,660
can remember.

299
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,540
There's the famous brothel scene in Final Fantasy VII, countless anime have done jokes

300
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,540
about it.

301
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,780
Hell, I played Star Tropics on my dad's old NES when I was like five years old, and

302
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,900
there was a scene there where the hero had to cross-dress for a mission.

303
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,600
All of the usual jokes apply, like almost getting caught while you're undercover,

304
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,860
or getting hit on by straight men who don't know that you're not a girl.

305
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,180
It's played for laughs, and it's embarrassing and uncomfortable for the characters involved,

306
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,340
but it's never portrayed as hateful.

307
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,200
In Breath of the Wild, even if you choose to tell the cross-dressing man you can buy

308
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,820
the clothes from that you can see he's a he, that doesn't lead to trans violence,

309
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,460
regardless of what the mouth-breathers at Polygon say.

310
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,620
The Japanese still have a sense of humor about gender-bendy stuff, and it's honestly refreshing

311
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,420
to not feel constantly policed on the topic.

312
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,480
But it's this scene that has spawned tons of gay and trans Link porn.

313
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,020
From Link transitioning, to Link bottoming for Hyrule soldiers, to Link and Zelda both

314
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,940
fucking Ganon, to Link getting kidnapped and gang-raped by the Yiga, this stuff is

315
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,020
all over the internet, and it's gotten to the point that the progs are taking it as

316
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,020
canon.

317
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,040
It's not, though, their brains are just porn-addled.

318
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,100
In an interview with Time Magazine, Zelda head honcho Eiji Aonoma said,

319
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:16,300
Back during the Ocarina of Time days, that was 1998, I wanted Link to be gender-neutral.

320
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,340
I wanted the player to think, maybe Link is a boy or a girl.

321
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,300
If you saw Link as a guy, he'd have more of a feminine touch.

322
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,300
Or vice versa.

323
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,180
If you saw Link as a girl, it was with more of a masculine aspect.

324
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,980
I really wanted the designer to encompass more of a gender-neutral figure, so I've

325
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,060
always thought that for either female or male players, I wanted them to be able to relate

326
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,060
to Link.

327
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,060
And yeah, that makes sense.

328
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,900
In Ocarina of Time, you play as both child Link and adult Link.

329
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,800
Child Link is more feminine, and adult Link is more masculine.

330
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,460
In Wind Waker, Link is a child and he's very cartoony.

331
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,300
In Twilight Princess, Link is a bit more realistic, and probably the most masculine we've ever

332
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
seen him.

333
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,240
In Skyward Sword, though, Link's got an almost exaggeratedly feminine face.

334
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,520
In Link's Awakening, at least the remake, he's a diorama toy.

335
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,360
Nintendo has had no problem with drastically changing the style of Zelda games over the

336
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,360
years.

337
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,600
And that includes both Link's age and his gendered features.

338
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,800
And yes, there's also been a girl version too.

339
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,140
Hyrule Legends introduced Linkle, who is explicitly female.

340
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,440
In Breath of the Wild, Link is quite androgynous, and that carries over into Tears of the Kingdom.

341
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,000
I guess, even though it's been five years, he hasn't yet suffered from twink death.

342
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Here's the thing.

343
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,360
If Nintendo actually made Link canonically gay or trans or something in the next game,

344
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,880
I don't think I'd care that much.

345
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,280
Like I said, they've always played around with Link's design.

346
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,100
They've played him off as androgynous, they've made him more masculine or more feminine.

347
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,240
So making a gay Link or a trans Link or another girl Link, that would just be in line with

348
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,240
what Nintendo seems to do.

349
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,520
But, they haven't made him gay or trans yet, and the attempts to claim him just seem

350
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,240
to be porn-induced cope.

351
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,200
And because Nintendo hasn't bent to their whims yet, people are actually saying that

352
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,920
it's homophobic or transphobic or some type of queerphobic that Link and Sidon aren't

353
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,680
a thing, and that both have canon straight partners.

354
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,760
In the same way that they said it was queerphobic, that Bayonetta and John were canonically revealed

355
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,640
to not be a couple in Bayonetta 3 last fall.

356
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,100
There's a lot more to this topic beyond just Zelda, that progressive machine that queers

357
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,220
straight cis characters, and then demands that the authors and creators of those characters

358
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,040
canonize their delusions.

359
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,640
Let's start off with this legendary old Twitter thread from the Gamergate era.

360
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Ugh.

361
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,500
They don't want us to take poison away from us, y'all.

362
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,680
They don't want us to have Samus, they don't want us to have poison, fuck that.

363
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,440
I'm not gonna be left in a world where the only single transgender woman treated with

364
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,340
dignity in a game is Vivian.

365
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,340
Fuck that.

366
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,340
Samus is trans.

367
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,340
Poison is trans.

368
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
Link is trans.

369
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,340
Zelda is trans.

370
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,340
Tails is trans.

371
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,340
Your faves are trans.

372
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,340
That's it.

373
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,340
I don't care about canon.

374
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,600
I don't care about authorial intent.

375
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,360
I demand queer representation, and I will subvert and take away your spaces.

376
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
I don't give a fuck.

377
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,240
This is revolutionary queerness.

378
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,920
This is dismantling the pointless colonial binary.

379
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,080
You can't have this.

380
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,420
Here's a TLDR of what's going on here.

381
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,000
Poison is, in the Japanese version of Final Fight, a woman and a common enemy that you

382
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
come across.

383
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,320
Because, in Final Fight, you brutally beat the shit out of every enemy, when the game

384
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,200
was localized to English in the 90s, the translators changed her character and made her into a

385
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,840
cross-dressing man, at least in the dialogue, in order to avoid a violence against women

386
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,720
in video games charge, which was all the rage back then.

387
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,980
So in Japan, poison's a cis woman.

388
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,500
In America, Poison is a cross-dressing man.

389
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,940
But in neither version is she trans.

390
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,040
Vivian is one of the three shadow sisters from Paper Mario the Thousand-Year Door.

391
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,740
She is abused by her two older and uglier sisters, and she eventually joins Mario's

392
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,160
side and fights against them and the other villains of the game.

393
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,840
In the English localization, she's just a female character.

394
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,300
In the original Japanese, she's an otakonoko, meaning male daughter.

395
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,260
This isn't a trans identity, it's more like a man who cross-dresses and also takes

396
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,380
up a feminine gender role, but is still a man.

397
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,760
The joke is that despite not being female, Vivian is far more feminine than the other

398
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,980
shadow sisters.

399
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,220
And while the sisters abuse Vivian for being an otakonoko, Mario doesn't care one way

400
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,220
or another.

401
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,600
So in the original Japanese, she's an otakonoko, which some people think is trans, most people

402
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,860
think it isn't, while in the English version, she's just a cis woman.

403
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,260
Samus is the hero of the Metroid games, a genetically modified human female who is stronger

404
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,020
and larger as a result.

405
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,740
She wears power armor and fights aliens and giant monsters and robots.

406
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,620
In the original game, it was hard to tell what Samus was.

407
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,920
When you died, you got a brief flicker of the armor breaking and a vaguely female shape

408
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,280
getting vaporized, but if you 100%ed the game, you got to see Samus out of her armor and

409
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,700
waving at the player.

410
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,420
Most kids back in the 90s thought Samus was a man or a robot, and only the true gamers

411
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,480
knew she was a woman.

412
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,900
In one interview, a background designer made the claim that Samus is trans as a joke, and

413
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,660
the co-creator of Metroid later clarified that Samus is a cis woman.

414
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,700
In fact, Samus was inspired by Ellen Ripley from 1979's Alien.

415
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,300
You've of course already covered Link and Zelda.

416
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:48,540
People think that Tails is trans because Tails, being a 12-year-old fox boy, is often voiced

417
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,960
by a woman, and the online Sonic community is rife with gay furry porn.

418
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,700
The point is, the revolutionary queerness that Katie-Bat is talking about consists of

419
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,780
taking any and all characters who play with gender in any way, even if only a little bit,

420
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:08,120
even if in only one version or one localization of the game, and declaring them as trans.

421
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,780
Random characters are made trans with no real reasoning behind it, and Twitter laps it up

422
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,860
as praxis.

423
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,740
The most famous anime traps and cross-dressers are declared trans unilaterally, even as those

424
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,500
characters call themselves boys or men.

425
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,780
Naoto from Persona 4 is a tomboy who feels feminine desires and refers to herself as

426
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:32,220
a girl, but nonetheless still chooses to adopt a more masculine appearance and behaviors.

427
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,220
Those were so mad that she wasn't turned into a trans man in the western localization

428
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:41,380
of the game that they made a mod for the PC version to do just that, completely missing

429
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,060
the point of her character arc.

430
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,260
Naoto's story is fundamentally a feminist one, that the professional workplace in Japan

431
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,760
is so rife with sexism that talented, capable women who want to engage in that world feel

432
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,040
forced to be more masculine than they actually are.

433
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:01,820
Making Naoto a trans man is basically admitting defeat in the face of patriarchal oppression,

434
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,380
saying that women actually have to become men, in the progressive transgender sense,

435
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,580
in order to even have a career at all.

436
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,280
And of course we've already discussed Cloud from Final Fantasy VII.

437
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,260
Because he cross-dresses to sneak into a brothel, and isn't happy about it really, he's

438
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,480
now trans, and there's almost as much porn of him as a bottom as there is of Link, because

439
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,140
of the way the cross-dressing scene was made up during the modern remake of the game.

440
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,220
Forget about video games though, what about movies?

441
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,700
Indiana Jones has a strained relationship with his father, who refuses to call him by

442
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
his chosen name?

443
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,820
I guess Indy's trans now.

444
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,820
How about comics?

445
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,220
Let's make Harley Quinn trans.

446
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
Why?

447
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,220
Well, because she's mentally unstable.

448
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,740
I guess that's enough for the progressives.

449
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,840
This one's actually really funny.

450
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,340
The idea that transness is a mental illness is transphobic, but now they're using mental

451
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,940
illness as the primary marker of transness for Harley.

452
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,780
Hey, how about real fucking people?

453
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,420
James Allen, a woman who cross-dressed and presented as a man in order to hide her lesbian

454
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,980
relationship, but who actually was a woman in private, has been reinvented as a trans

455
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,700
man by modern activists.

456
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,580
Joan of Arc, because she was a woman doing something that only men did in that era, is

457
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,700
now also a trans icon.

458
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,580
These characters, these people, they're not trans, what's actually happening here?

459
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,500
It's a concept known as the trans umbrella.

460
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,840
You probably know that the number of trans people is rising steadily right now.

461
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,140
Part of that rise can be contributed to more people being out of the closet than before,

462
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,100
whether that's because they're more educated about gender stuff now and they can come to

463
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,980
the realization sooner, or because they have more affirming families and friends who won't

464
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,380
cut them off for coming out.

465
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,220
However, part of that rise can also be contributed to social contagion.

466
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,660
In progressive areas, being trans now gives you social clout, and so we see more people

467
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,260
in schools, particularly girls and young women, declaring themselves trans because they have

468
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,260
short hair and wear jeans instead of dresses, and their teacher told them that that's what

469
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,260
it meant.

470
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,820
But another part of what's going on here can be due to the trans umbrella.

471
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,460
When I was in school, when a woman was a tomboy, she was still a woman.

472
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,620
A more masculine presenting woman, but still a woman.

473
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,980
We had a similar thing for men, the pretty boys and the emo kids of the 2000s.

474
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,940
And to go back even further, the metrosexuals of the 90s.

475
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:00,180
This era was an expansion of possibilities regarding what you could do as a man or a

476
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,180
woman.

477
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,620
You could be a pretty man, you could be a tough woman.

478
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,860
But with the rise of trans stuff, that progress has been rolled backwards.

479
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,900
Now progressives have very strict gender roles, except that if you happen to align with a

480
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,900
gender role that is not correlated with your birth sex, you're trans instead.

481
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,220
So masculine women can't be tomboys anymore, they're trans men.

482
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,420
Feminine men can't be femboys or traps anymore, they're trans women.

483
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,860
And in fact, femboy or trap is considered a slur for trans women now, as part of erasing

484
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
that identity.

485
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,820
Before, there were many types of gender nonconformity that were accepted as different ways to be

486
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,820
men or women.

487
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,080
But now, all gender nonconformity is under the trans umbrella.

488
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,500
This is why, to the trans activists, men who do any sort of gender bending are actually

489
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,380
trans women who are still in their eggs, and they need to be hatched.

490
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,760
That's a huge conversation, the egg hatching thing, it's not going to fit into this video.

491
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,620
But the reason they're coming for fictional characters and historical figures is to normalize

492
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,700
that process using entertainment media and culture.

493
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,260
Samus is a cis woman doing something traditionally masculine.

494
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,860
By my normie liberal 2000s era standard, she's a tomboy.

495
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,100
Hell, in some games, she's actually presented as being downright motherly and feminine.

496
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,740
But per the progressive modern standard, her engagement with a traditional masculine role

497
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,060
makes her trans.

498
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,300
Whether that's a trans man or a trans woman depends on which specific progressive you're

499
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,080
talking to and what fetishes they have.

500
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,740
In any case, she's some type of gender nonconforming and therefore she's trans now.

501
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,860
Men and Vivian were crossdressers in one localization and cis women in another.

502
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:27,800
But because they were some type of gender nonconforming somewhere, they're now trans.

503
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,460
Because Link and Cloud are both crossdressed specifically to infiltrate somewhere and not

504
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,800
because it's who they are, and the internet made a lot of porn out of it, they are some

505
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,420
type of gender nonconforming and therefore they're trans now.

506
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,680
Considering how long it took trans people to ditch the idea that they were just male

507
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,700
crossdressers with a fetish, you'd think that trans activists turning all of these

508
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:52,080
instances of male crossdressers into trans icons would be seen as extremely insulting.

509
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,160
But the majority of trans activists aren't actually trans, they're either misguided

510
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,640
allies or weird fetishists themselves.

511
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,200
Of course, they'll obfuscate all this by saying, hey, it's just fan-made porn, it's

512
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,760
just a headcanon, it's just entertainment, why do you care?

513
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,280
Let people enjoy things.

514
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
Sure, fair enough.

515
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,720
But they're not saying that in good faith.

516
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,280
That's just to get you to shut up.

517
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,680
Why do I think this?

518
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,960
This is Tracer, the star of Overwatch, the character on the cover.

519
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,680
She is canonically a lesbian.

520
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,140
There is tons of porn on the internet of Tracer getting dicked down, getting gangbanged,

521
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,540
her and her GF sharing cock, all of it.

522
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:27,820
There's so much Tracer porn out there that most people actually forget that she's exclusively

523
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,740
lesbian in canon, and progressive Overwatch fans have screamed bloody murder about that

524
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
for years.

525
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,220
But hey, it's just entertainment, it's just headcanon, it's just porn, who cares?

526
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,560
Well, they do.

527
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,780
Because they don't think it's just entertainment.

528
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,780
Even as they tell you that, everything is political, including normalization of values

529
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,900
through pop culture.

530
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,500
This example is about race, not gay or trans stuff, but it still fits the bill.

531
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,920
When The Little Mermaid was race-swapped to be black, progressives told people that it's

532
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,660
totally fine and to stop freaking out about a children's movie.

533
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:00,360
But when an artist race-swapped The Little Mermaid back, she got lambasted for being

534
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,360
racist.

535
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,520
It's just a children's movie, what are you freaking out about?

536
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,560
This double standard puts their actual goal on display, normalization.

537
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,280
They view it as a culture war victory every time a character is canonically made trans,

538
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,920
even if it completely destroys the character, like with the Bridgette fiasco from Guilty

539
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,140
Gear last year.

540
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,680
They do it because normalization brings power.

541
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:23,480
My pal Arch talked at length about this tweet, where an activist demanded that Warhammer

542
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,620
bring in female space marines, in violation of the lore and the fan's love for the series,

543
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,320
because space marines are the main characters in the poster child.

544
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Representation is power.

545
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,660
They use that power to normalize certain values in media as a part of a larger push to normalize

546
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,380
those values in real life.

547
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,700
They only care about manipulating popular femboy or trap or otherwise gender nonconforming

548
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,060
characters in order to make them into trans icons as a part of that normalization and

549
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
control.

550
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,820
Positive, happy characters that are traps or femboys or hell just pass well when they

551
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,240
cross-dress like Link.

552
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,660
They are specifically targeted by activists because one, they're easy to pornify as

553
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:03,240
trans, and two, because they're feminine men who are nonetheless happy with being men,

554
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,440
something that trans activists hate.

555
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,880
And this spills over into the treatment of real-life feminine men who are happy with

556
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
being men.

557
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:14,060
In order to accomplish this normalization, they do all of the weird stuff that rightoid

558
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,740
transvestigators do.

559
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,060
Look guys, there's a trans flag in the background, this character must be trans, look at her

560
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,740
jaw shape guys, look at her hand, trans trans trans.

561
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
This is all very weird.

562
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,980
At the end of the day, it is just a video game.

563
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,980
Zelda is a game in a canon that I care about, but like I said, if they made Link a girl

564
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,180
or whatever next time around, I wouldn't care, as long as the game itself is good.

565
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,980
It doesn't matter to me if they make Samus trans as long as the game is good.

566
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,100
It doesn't matter if The Last of Us has gay characters as long as it's good, and

567
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,200
the TV show wasn't.

568
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,960
I personally don't care all that much, but I do know that their ultimate designs aren't

569
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
on media.

570
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,280
That's a means to an end.

571
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,240
Their designs are on real people, something that we'll have to talk about next time.

572
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,720
And that's a lot more important.

573
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,480
Anyway, Tears of the Kingdom is a great game, Link is straight, Sidon is straight, Final

574
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,960
Fantasy 16 only has white people in it, and the best games coming out nowadays don't

575
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,440
give a shit about representation.

576
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
Stay mad, faggots.
