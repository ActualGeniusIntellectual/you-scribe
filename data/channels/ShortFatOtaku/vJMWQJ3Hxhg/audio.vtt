WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.580
I have to come clean.

00:13.580 --> 00:17.680
One big reason you haven't seen many videos from me is because The Legend of Zelda Tears

00:17.680 --> 00:20.600
of the Kingdom came out and I've been doing nothing but playing that.

00:20.600 --> 00:24.440
Now that's not the only reason, I've been doing a lot of E3 streams in the channel too.

00:24.440 --> 00:29.160
Yes, E3 is dead in that the actual event in LA with the booths on the show floor?

00:29.160 --> 00:30.160
That was killed by COVID.

00:30.160 --> 00:34.240
But the E3 season still lives on in the minds of gamers, and the first half of June was

00:34.240 --> 00:37.960
stuffed full of conferences by a bunch of game developers talking about what games are

00:37.960 --> 00:41.920
coming up next, so I spent a lot of time doing prep and streaming those instead.

00:41.920 --> 00:46.060
But the lion's share has been me goofing off with Tears of the Kingdom, yes.

00:46.060 --> 00:47.060
How could I not?

00:47.060 --> 00:50.520
I love Zelda as a series, I love Breath of the Wild, the game that Tears of the Kingdom

00:50.520 --> 00:54.320
is a direct sequel to, and I am fully obsessed with Link's latest adventure.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.120
I know that the Final Fantasy XVI demo was pretty awesome and Starfield also looks really

00:58.120 --> 01:01.680
good, but I genuinely think that Zelda Tears of the Kingdom is going to win Game of the

01:01.680 --> 01:02.680
Year 2023.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.260
It's pretty much the perfect storm of old and new.

01:05.260 --> 01:09.320
Breath of the Wild saw Link waking up after 100 years of stasis with no memories, in a

01:09.320 --> 01:11.280
completely desolate Kingdom of Hyrule.

01:11.280 --> 01:15.120
The various villages dotting the countryside had been destroyed, the great monuments to

01:15.120 --> 01:19.940
Hyrule's royal family in ruins, Hyrule Castle, the seat of power of the entire country occupied

01:19.940 --> 01:21.600
by Ganon's demon army.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.320
Those habited areas that did survive were under siege, or they were cursed, or they

01:25.320 --> 01:26.740
had some other problem afflicting them.

01:26.740 --> 01:29.300
The tone of Breath of the Wild is loneliness.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.740
When you played that game, you felt truly alone.

01:31.740 --> 01:35.140
But the theme of the game is rebuilding after loss.

01:35.140 --> 01:38.640
Link is a hero out of time, and as you recover his memories, you begin to understand what

01:38.640 --> 01:39.640
that means.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.820
All of his friends are gone, well, most of them.

01:41.820 --> 01:46.760
The Zora, the fish people, serve as the Zelda series' elves, being long-lived and building

01:46.760 --> 01:49.300
ornate domains hidden away from human eyes.

01:49.300 --> 01:53.140
And Prince Sidon was a child before Link was put to sleep, and he is now an adult.

01:53.140 --> 01:56.720
Aside from him, though, everyone and everything is gone, and the majority of the game revolves

01:56.720 --> 02:01.040
around Link's relationship with civilization as both familiar and outsider.

02:01.040 --> 02:04.720
You can meet with the descendants of Link's old friends, help them with their struggles,

02:04.720 --> 02:05.720
and watch them grow.

02:05.720 --> 02:10.760
You can bring bandits to justice, and beat back Ganon's army from formerly-habited areas.

02:10.760 --> 02:13.400
You can explore ancient ruins and learn the truth of the past.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.620
Hell, if you want the theme of Breath of the Wild wrapped up in a tidy bow for you, it's

02:16.620 --> 02:18.520
the questline where you found Tarrytown.

02:18.520 --> 02:22.080
The site that Tarrytown eventually gets built on was weird to me the first time I encountered

02:22.080 --> 02:23.080
it.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.760
It had a goddess statue at the center, like all towns do, but nothing else.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.540
As you do quests for Hudson, a hard-working entrepreneur, you eventually help him found

02:29.540 --> 02:33.840
his construction company, and they will build Tarrytown from the ground up around that lonely

02:33.840 --> 02:35.120
goddess statue.

02:35.120 --> 02:38.680
Upon the completion of Hudson's questline, Tarrytown becomes emblematic of the overall

02:38.680 --> 02:42.060
theme of Breath of the Wild, rebuilding after a great loss.

02:42.060 --> 02:46.440
In a political sense, it's both conservative, as a new Link in the great ongoing chain of

02:46.440 --> 02:51.160
civilization, no pun intended, and it's progressive, as Tarrytown is specifically made up of members

02:51.160 --> 02:56.340
from each of Hyrule's tribes, Human, Zora, Rito, Goron, and Gerudo, and they each bring

02:56.340 --> 02:59.020
their own culture and practices to Tarrytown.

02:59.020 --> 03:02.800
Loss is a moment in which both progressives and conservatives have a role to play, the

03:02.800 --> 03:05.400
creation of the future and the honoring of the past.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.000
Tears of the Kingdom is a direct continuation of Breath of the Wild, both in terms of story

03:09.000 --> 03:10.600
and in terms of theme.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.640
Five years have passed and the land is gradually being resettled.

03:13.640 --> 03:17.280
Tarrytown is a thriving hub of innovation, and Hudson's construction company is now

03:17.280 --> 03:19.440
a vital part of rebuilding Hyrule.

03:19.440 --> 03:23.000
Other new villages are slowly popping up again now that the threat is gone, or it was

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
gone.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.260
There's new problems to solve of course, it wouldn't be a Zelda game without villains

03:26.260 --> 03:29.160
to fight, but Hyrule doesn't seem empty and deserted anymore.

03:29.160 --> 03:33.120
It's under siege again, but this time people, normal people, not just heroes, are pushing

03:33.120 --> 03:34.600
back against the threats.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.560
This time the game feels optimistic, not desolate.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.960
Like yes, things are pretty bad, but we can still do this.

03:39.960 --> 03:43.520
Plus from a gameplay perspective, going back to old haunts is just a lot of fun.

03:43.520 --> 03:48.280
Yeah, they added the sky islands and the underworld as two huge new locations you can visit, but

03:48.280 --> 03:52.120
the surface world is the same as the Breath of the Wild map, with five years added onto

03:52.120 --> 03:53.120
it.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.760
Checking out how Tarrytown has grown, catching up with familiar faces from before, even remembering

03:56.760 --> 04:00.660
noteworthy gameplay challenges like the Great Plateau or Eventide Island, and wondering

04:00.660 --> 04:02.120
what's going on there now.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.260
The world feels like it's grown as well, and if you love Breath of the Wild, Tears

04:05.260 --> 04:09.060
of the Kingdom is full of those continuity moments that you've been waiting for.

04:09.060 --> 04:11.200
Yes I know, my channel is not just a gaming channel.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.120
I'm sure you're waiting for me to get to the point.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.400
And also yes, I'm indulging myself a bit.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.560
There's no other time I'd be able to gush about Tears of the Kingdom like this.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.780
But okay, here's the point.

04:19.780 --> 04:23.280
The reason the game is breaking sales records, and people are calling it the game of the

04:23.280 --> 04:27.400
year, the best Zelda game ever, the best game of all time even, is because Nintendo actually

04:27.400 --> 04:32.960
seems to care about the quality of their games, but also the quality of their franchises themselves.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.240
Check out this article.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.760
Developers agree that Zelda Tears of the Kingdom is a miracle.

04:36.760 --> 04:40.780
What's going on here is that prominent Western developers like Josh Scherr, who worked as

04:40.780 --> 04:44.940
Narrative Director on Naughty Dogs The Last of Us Part II, or Allison Lures, who worked

04:44.980 --> 04:49.500
on Destiny 2, or Corey Brotherson, who worked for Sony before going indie, all expressed

04:49.500 --> 04:52.780
shock and amazement at the stunning quality of Tears of the Kingdom.

04:52.780 --> 04:56.700
Now I don't know what Corey Brotherson's actually done, and Destiny 2 has always been

04:56.700 --> 05:02.180
mid ever since it was called Destiny 1, but I do know that The Last of Us Part II is universally

05:02.180 --> 05:03.180
fan-panned.

05:03.180 --> 05:07.620
It's a part of a long series of millennial-led media where established, beloved characters

05:07.620 --> 05:13.000
and stories are brutally killed off or subverted by the new author's inserted favorite character

05:13.000 --> 05:15.200
as a giant fuck you to the fans.

05:15.200 --> 05:19.460
The creators of this new chapter in the story demand that fans side with their new focus,

05:19.460 --> 05:24.580
when what tends to actually happen is that fans abandon the franchise for greener pastures.

05:24.580 --> 05:27.680
Probably the most blatant example of what I'm talking about is the recent announcement

05:27.680 --> 05:32.120
that Rey is coming back to Star Wars to rebuild the Jedi Order in a new series of movies,

05:32.120 --> 05:36.100
which is exactly what Luke Skywalker's story should have been, and in fact was, before

05:36.100 --> 05:38.560
Disney de-canonized the extended universe.

05:38.560 --> 05:42.240
The message is clear, the new protectors of these properties, these universes, they want

05:42.240 --> 05:46.740
the name, they want the icon, they want the status, they want the clout of those franchises,

05:46.740 --> 05:50.960
but they want to use them as vehicles to tell their new stories rather than continue what

05:50.960 --> 05:52.300
was laid down before.

05:52.300 --> 05:53.480
Why is this?

05:53.480 --> 05:55.020
Sometimes it's just hubris.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.920
Sometimes though, it's to push a political message.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.000
See my Antonio Gramsci video on that.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.440
But not so with Nintendo.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.400
When they make a game, you're pretty much guaranteed to get what you expect, for better

06:03.400 --> 06:04.400
or worse.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.720
Usually better, though as a Nintendfag I'm biased.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.920
Mario is always going to be about an Italian plumber running around a set of themed worlds,

06:09.920 --> 06:14.000
creating blocks, getting power-ups, beating back Bowser's minions, and saving the princess.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.240
Sometimes you'll use fire powers, and sometimes you'll ride a dinosaur friend, and sometimes

06:17.240 --> 06:20.040
you'll jump into paintings, and sometimes you'll use a water pack, and sometimes you'll

06:20.040 --> 06:23.480
go to outer space, and sometimes you can throw your hat to possess enemies, but the game

06:23.480 --> 06:24.740
is fundamentally the same.

06:24.740 --> 06:28.360
The restriction on the core formula allows the experimentation of the other aspects to

06:28.360 --> 06:29.360
really stand out.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.920
The Legend of Zelda as a series is the same way.

06:31.920 --> 06:35.060
Nintendo changes things all the time, but never in a way that feels like a betrayal.

06:35.060 --> 06:37.940
In Ocarina of Time you travel through time and try to change the future.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.860
In Majora's Mask you wear masks that grant you new powers.

06:40.860 --> 06:44.020
In Wind Waker the kingdom is flooded and you sail around the ocean on a ship.

06:44.020 --> 06:47.800
In Twilight Princess you explore an alternate dimension known as the Twilight Realm, exposure

06:47.800 --> 06:50.740
to which turns Link into a wolf, which furries absolutely loved.

06:50.740 --> 06:54.140
In Skyward Sword the game takes place on floating islands and you zip around in the back of

06:54.140 --> 06:58.700
a huge bird, but in each of them the core of what makes Zelda Zelda is present.

06:58.700 --> 07:03.200
Link is a hero, Zelda is a princess, Ganon is present in some way, either as Ganondorf,

07:03.200 --> 07:06.940
his mortal form as the King of the Gerudo, or as the Demon King himself.

07:06.940 --> 07:10.500
These three eternal characters represent the three virtues of the Triforce, courage,

07:10.500 --> 07:14.300
wisdom and power, and the relationship between the three plays out in an appropriate manner

07:14.300 --> 07:15.300
every game.

07:15.300 --> 07:19.520
The changes make the games fun, but the continuity makes the games meaningful.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.300
Even in small ways there's a lot of continuity in fact.

07:22.300 --> 07:26.420
Breath of the Wild saw players really fear the Lionel, the most dangerous of the Dark

07:26.420 --> 07:27.900
Lord's ground forces.

07:27.900 --> 07:31.680
Standing at about 20 feet tall, thousands of pounds of muscle, Lionel's have the lower

07:31.680 --> 07:34.780
body of a horse, the upper body of a man and the head of a lion.

07:34.780 --> 07:38.500
They carry some of the best equipment in the game, steel swords forged in the lava

07:38.500 --> 07:43.240
of Death Mountain larger than any claymore, bows with metal drawstrings that no human

07:43.240 --> 07:47.260
could possibly pull back, firing multiple short spears every shot.

07:47.260 --> 07:50.980
They're ridiculously hard to defeat, and YouTube is filled with many a video of new

07:50.980 --> 07:55.140
players accidentally finding one, freaking out and getting completely destroyed.

07:55.140 --> 07:59.340
Taking down a Lionel is considered a true feat, both in the lore and among players.

07:59.340 --> 08:03.340
And Lionel's got their start back in the original 1986 game as these little guys.

08:03.340 --> 08:05.300
Doesn't exactly inspire fear, does it?

08:05.300 --> 08:08.620
But it's the continuity that matters, knowing that that's what they were then and this

08:08.620 --> 08:09.620
is what they are now.

08:09.620 --> 08:10.980
Here's what I mean.

08:10.980 --> 08:14.740
Moblins are these little pig-dog goblin monsters that have been in pretty much every game.

08:14.740 --> 08:18.260
Even if you aren't a Zelda fan, if I show you this picture and say, this is a Moblin,

08:18.260 --> 08:22.860
you can probably understand intuitively that he's a basic low-level soldier in Ganon's

08:22.860 --> 08:23.860
army.

08:23.860 --> 08:24.860
Nothing too scary.

08:24.860 --> 08:26.360
That's how you know you're dealing with something iconic.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.700
The context comes with the design.

08:28.700 --> 08:32.600
Moblin is an Anglicization of the original Japanese term, Mori Burin.

08:32.600 --> 08:36.880
This is a portmanteau of the Japanese word mori, which means forest, and goberin, which

08:36.880 --> 08:40.160
is a Japanese pronunciation of the English word goblin.

08:40.160 --> 08:42.120
So Moblin literally means forest goblin.

08:42.120 --> 08:46.840
If you've ever played Japanese RPGs, have you noticed how their orcs are often pigmen

08:46.840 --> 08:49.220
and their kobolds are often wolfmen?

08:49.220 --> 08:54.360
Even though in the West, orcs are green-skinned barbarians and kobolds are lizardmen or sometimes

08:54.360 --> 08:56.500
ratmen like in the case of Warcraft.

08:56.500 --> 09:00.840
In my video about Yoshi-P a few months back, I talked about the history of Western-style

09:00.840 --> 09:02.260
fantasy in Japan.

09:02.260 --> 09:07.760
How the earliest Western fantasy games based off of D&D like Ultima and Wizardry were hugely

09:07.760 --> 09:12.760
popular in Japan and how they heavily influenced the first Japanese fantasy games Dragon Quest

09:12.760 --> 09:13.760
and Final Fantasy.

09:13.760 --> 09:17.900
In D&D First Edition, things weren't exactly clear on what was supposed to be what.

09:17.900 --> 09:23.040
For example, these are official First Edition orc miniatures showing them to have pig-like

09:23.040 --> 09:24.040
features.

09:24.040 --> 09:28.140
When Ultima and Wizardry were created, exactly what orcs and kobolds looked like hadn't been

09:28.140 --> 09:32.940
cemented in D&D or in terms of the wider culture yet, and they went off of the earliest

09:32.940 --> 09:35.060
depictions, which changed in the West over time.

09:35.060 --> 09:39.900
Newer Western games used these newer depictions from newer versions of D&D, but Japanese fantasy

09:39.900 --> 09:44.060
games are directly descended from Wizardry and Ultima, which both used the old designs.

09:44.060 --> 09:48.780
Further complicating the matter is that orc and goblin are used interchangeably when talking

09:48.780 --> 09:52.420
about the creatures in Lord of the Rings, which D&D was based off of.

09:52.420 --> 09:56.460
Future fantasy properties would differentiate them, again most notably Warcraft, where goblins

09:56.460 --> 10:00.460
are tiny green midgets that evolved from an animalistic state due to their contact

10:00.460 --> 10:04.460
with a rare powerful material, while orcs are aliens from another planet that evolved

10:04.460 --> 10:08.060
from rock giants getting infected by a weird hive-mind spore.

10:08.060 --> 10:09.700
Yeah, Warcraft lore is weird.

10:09.700 --> 10:14.000
But in Japan, since their entire Western fantasy canon came from Ultima and Wizardry, orcs

10:14.000 --> 10:16.500
and goblins remained as interchangeable terms.

10:16.500 --> 10:20.820
It also helped that in Japanese mythology, there was a creature called the Butato, a

10:20.820 --> 10:24.120
barbarian pig-man who wore armor and used spears.

10:24.120 --> 10:27.840
The Butato look very similar to the original depiction of orcs in the first edition of

10:27.840 --> 10:32.960
D&D, which is why in the Zelda series, the Moblins, forest goblins, have pig-like qualities

10:32.960 --> 10:37.440
and use spears, and why orcs in other Japanese games and anime are pig-men.

10:37.440 --> 10:40.840
When I said that Moblins are iconic earlier, this is what I was getting at.

10:40.840 --> 10:45.920
Both Western and Japanese players look at the Moblin and instantly see all of this context,

10:45.920 --> 10:49.100
if only subconsciously, and they immediately get what they're all about.

10:49.100 --> 10:53.040
The two different types of players are seeing the Moblin in a different cultural context,

10:53.040 --> 10:56.800
but due to the convergence of factors, they're nonetheless pulling out more or less the same

10:56.800 --> 10:57.800
information.

10:57.800 --> 11:01.200
And this state of affairs persists across all of the Zelda games, across all of the

11:01.200 --> 11:02.240
Moblin designs.

11:02.240 --> 11:07.520
And not just Moblins, but Darknuts, Wizrobes, Stalfos, Wallmasters, they've all got a

11:07.520 --> 11:12.160
detailed origin story that can be understood through simple intuition, and each iteration

11:12.160 --> 11:15.280
builds on the previous all the way up to the present day.

11:15.280 --> 11:19.960
This is how you know that Nintendo is masterclass at what they do, and that they truly care

11:19.960 --> 11:20.960
about their games.

11:21.180 --> 11:25.320
It's this continuity of meaning that drives people back to Nintendo's games time and

11:25.320 --> 11:28.980
again, and Zelda games in particular, something that can only be built up through decades

11:28.980 --> 11:29.980
of iteration.

11:29.980 --> 11:33.460
And unlike with, say, The Last of Us Part II, they haven't sacrificed all of that

11:33.460 --> 11:36.460
denseness and meaning to serve as a political message.

11:36.460 --> 11:40.800
And I think it's that lack of a political message that drives Western progressives to

11:40.800 --> 11:42.760
desperately try to overlay one.

11:42.760 --> 11:46.660
A guy I follow on Twitter, Manlit Thorin, great name by the way, compared Nintendo Woman

11:46.660 --> 11:51.380
to PlayStation Woman, showing the scientist Pura from Zelda, and Bayonetta from, well,

11:51.380 --> 11:55.540
Bayonetta, versus Aloy from Horizon and Abby from The Last of Us Part II.

11:55.540 --> 11:59.020
Funnily enough, Aloy was actually more attractive in the previous game, she's not a 10 out

11:59.020 --> 12:02.660
of 10 or anything, but they're making a more realistic post-apocalyptic tribal game,

12:02.660 --> 12:03.660
so fair enough.

12:03.660 --> 12:06.600
But they actually hit her with the ugly stick for the sequel.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.660
The point here is that Nintendo isn't afraid to put in attractive characters into their

12:10.660 --> 12:14.660
games, even if they're in an anime style like Pura, while Sony is on this kick of

12:14.660 --> 12:16.660
normalizing ugly characters.

12:16.660 --> 12:20.660
This is just hilarious to me as a 90s kid, because back then it was the other way around.

12:20.660 --> 12:25.980
Nintendo was very puritan about both sex and violence, while Sony was courting that edgy

12:25.980 --> 12:29.100
90s crowd by leaning into exactly those things.

12:29.100 --> 12:32.580
What's going on here is representation, a topic that I'm going to have to do a deep

12:32.580 --> 12:33.580
dive on eventually.

12:33.580 --> 12:37.540
Yes, Sargon, I picked up Pitkin's book on the subject, it's on the list.

12:37.540 --> 12:41.380
Attractive women in media, like Pura or Bayonetta, are the norm.

12:41.380 --> 12:43.480
Non-attractive women like Aloy or Abby aren't.

12:43.480 --> 12:47.800
So in the name of equality, progressive logic insists that we should be normalizing non-attractive

12:47.800 --> 12:49.280
women taking center stage.

12:49.280 --> 12:53.320
The most recent video game related instance of this happening was Fable's reveal during

12:53.320 --> 12:56.160
E3, and it went down about as you can expect.

12:56.160 --> 13:00.520
Ugly female character went viral, fan artists made her more attractive, progressives shit

13:00.520 --> 13:02.280
themselves over it.

13:02.280 --> 13:06.400
Horizon and The Last of Us are made specifically with progressive politics in mind, at least

13:06.400 --> 13:07.400
partially.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.500
This is why people generally aren't running around on Twitter or Tumblr making up head

13:10.500 --> 13:14.020
cannons or screaming about how everything is political and so these games must also

13:14.020 --> 13:15.020
be political.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.020
We already know that they are.

13:16.020 --> 13:20.140
Frankly, it's why the libertarian gay romance at The Last of Us TV show didn't actually

13:20.140 --> 13:23.540
bother non-leftists all that much, at least for the gay thing anyway.

13:23.540 --> 13:26.540
The episode was actually a huge waste of time and didn't progress the story at all, but

13:26.540 --> 13:31.100
we expected it because that's what The Last of Us is, because Bill and Frank were gay

13:31.100 --> 13:32.580
in the original story.

13:32.580 --> 13:37.240
However, because Bayonetta and Zelda aren't made with political themes in mind, you see

13:37.240 --> 13:40.300
the Progs desperately trying to make them political.

13:40.300 --> 13:43.720
I covered this article on a past Weekly Sip, so we don't need to go too much into detail

13:43.720 --> 13:44.720
with it.

13:44.720 --> 13:45.800
Plus, it's also really cancerous.

13:45.800 --> 13:50.020
From our friends over at Polygon, Link is a gay icon and Zelda fans know it.

13:50.020 --> 13:53.260
The Legend of Zelda's queer themes are more than just subtext.

13:53.260 --> 13:56.980
This is the kind of article you write when a property doesn't actually have queer themes

13:56.980 --> 14:00.700
and you desperately have to spin it as if it does, in order to bring it into the progressive

14:00.700 --> 14:01.700
fold.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.940
No one writes articles like this about Horizon or The Last of Us, because there's no work

14:04.940 --> 14:07.740
to be done there to whitewash them as overtly woke.

14:07.740 --> 14:11.080
They already are, but because Zelda is not, they have to make it so.

14:11.080 --> 14:13.980
The examples given by the Progs are weak ones, of course.

14:13.980 --> 14:18.300
Some people have tried to spin two side characters, a master archaeologist and his apprentice,

14:18.300 --> 14:22.420
as being in a gay relationship, but that questline shows that while there's a lot of professional

14:22.420 --> 14:25.740
admiration there, it's not romantic, and you really have to squint your eyes to make

14:25.740 --> 14:29.380
the claim that this is the first gay character of the series.

14:29.380 --> 14:34.420
Some fans and shippers have also paired up Link with the post-100 year slumber aged up

14:34.420 --> 14:37.300
Prince Sidon due to their banter in Breath of the Wild.

14:37.300 --> 14:41.060
But Tears of the Kingdom has us return to Hyrule to meet Sidon's fiancée, and the

14:41.060 --> 14:43.140
Progs are not happy about it.

14:43.140 --> 14:44.900
Listen, he's the prince of the Zora.

14:44.900 --> 14:49.340
Why did you think he wasn't going to carry on his bloodline with a proper fish girl and

14:49.340 --> 14:52.380
instead engage in a gay interspecies relationship?

14:52.380 --> 14:57.340
And of course, Zelda's voice actress confirmed that Link and Zelda are, in fact, in a heterosexual

14:57.340 --> 15:00.900
relationship this time around, which can be corroborated in-game.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.340
In Breath of the Wild, you can actually save up and buy a house in Hateno Village.

15:04.340 --> 15:07.740
If you return to that house in Tears of the Kingdom, you'll find signs that Link and

15:07.740 --> 15:10.420
Zelda both live there together as a couple.

15:10.420 --> 15:15.060
Not every game makes Link and Zelda's relationship explicitly romantic.

15:15.060 --> 15:18.740
While they certainly are in Skyward Sword, in Wind Waker they're more like friends,

15:18.740 --> 15:23.020
and in Twilight Princess, Link's romantic arc is clearly with Midna, the princess of

15:23.020 --> 15:24.080
the Twilight Realm.

15:24.080 --> 15:27.940
But this time around, in the Breath of the Wild continuity, they are officially together.

15:27.940 --> 15:32.580
The most diehard fan theory, and the one that almost all of the online Link pornography

15:32.580 --> 15:37.920
revolves around, is the idea that Link is gay or trans or both or something.

15:37.920 --> 15:41.760
In Breath of the Wild, the Gerudo City is a woman-only location, as the Gerudo are a

15:41.760 --> 15:43.300
woman-only species.

15:43.300 --> 15:46.500
The women of other races are allowed in, but not the men.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.940
Gorons are allowed in because they're gender neutral, even though most Gorons look pretty

15:49.940 --> 15:50.940
masculine.

15:50.940 --> 15:53.980
And one of the Gorons inside the city is actually really confused about the whole affair.

15:53.980 --> 15:57.860
But Link has to go into the city as part of the main story, so you have the opportunity

15:57.860 --> 15:59.620
to cross-dress.

15:59.660 --> 16:02.660
Final Fantasy VII comedy has been a staple in Japanese entertainment for as long as I

16:02.660 --> 16:03.660
can remember.

16:03.660 --> 16:07.540
There's the famous brothel scene in Final Fantasy VII, countless anime have done jokes

16:07.540 --> 16:08.540
about it.

16:08.540 --> 16:12.780
Hell, I played Star Tropics on my dad's old NES when I was like five years old, and

16:12.780 --> 16:15.900
there was a scene there where the hero had to cross-dress for a mission.

16:15.900 --> 16:19.600
All of the usual jokes apply, like almost getting caught while you're undercover,

16:19.600 --> 16:22.860
or getting hit on by straight men who don't know that you're not a girl.

16:22.860 --> 16:26.180
It's played for laughs, and it's embarrassing and uncomfortable for the characters involved,

16:26.180 --> 16:28.340
but it's never portrayed as hateful.

16:28.340 --> 16:31.200
In Breath of the Wild, even if you choose to tell the cross-dressing man you can buy

16:31.200 --> 16:35.820
the clothes from that you can see he's a he, that doesn't lead to trans violence,

16:35.820 --> 16:38.460
regardless of what the mouth-breathers at Polygon say.

16:38.460 --> 16:42.620
The Japanese still have a sense of humor about gender-bendy stuff, and it's honestly refreshing

16:42.620 --> 16:45.420
to not feel constantly policed on the topic.

16:45.420 --> 16:50.480
But it's this scene that has spawned tons of gay and trans Link porn.

16:50.480 --> 16:55.020
From Link transitioning, to Link bottoming for Hyrule soldiers, to Link and Zelda both

16:55.020 --> 16:59.940
fucking Ganon, to Link getting kidnapped and gang-raped by the Yiga, this stuff is

16:59.940 --> 17:04.020
all over the internet, and it's gotten to the point that the progs are taking it as

17:04.020 --> 17:05.020
canon.

17:05.020 --> 17:07.040
It's not, though, their brains are just porn-addled.

17:07.040 --> 17:11.100
In an interview with Time Magazine, Zelda head honcho Eiji Aonoma said,

17:11.100 --> 17:16.300
Back during the Ocarina of Time days, that was 1998, I wanted Link to be gender-neutral.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.340
I wanted the player to think, maybe Link is a boy or a girl.

17:19.340 --> 17:22.300
If you saw Link as a guy, he'd have more of a feminine touch.

17:22.300 --> 17:23.300
Or vice versa.

17:23.300 --> 17:26.180
If you saw Link as a girl, it was with more of a masculine aspect.

17:26.180 --> 17:29.980
I really wanted the designer to encompass more of a gender-neutral figure, so I've

17:29.980 --> 17:34.060
always thought that for either female or male players, I wanted them to be able to relate

17:34.060 --> 17:35.060
to Link.

17:35.060 --> 17:36.060
And yeah, that makes sense.

17:36.060 --> 17:38.900
In Ocarina of Time, you play as both child Link and adult Link.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.800
Child Link is more feminine, and adult Link is more masculine.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.460
In Wind Waker, Link is a child and he's very cartoony.

17:44.460 --> 17:48.300
In Twilight Princess, Link is a bit more realistic, and probably the most masculine we've ever

17:48.300 --> 17:49.300
seen him.

17:49.300 --> 17:53.240
In Skyward Sword, though, Link's got an almost exaggeratedly feminine face.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.520
In Link's Awakening, at least the remake, he's a diorama toy.

17:56.520 --> 18:00.360
Nintendo has had no problem with drastically changing the style of Zelda games over the

18:00.360 --> 18:01.360
years.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.600
And that includes both Link's age and his gendered features.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.800
And yes, there's also been a girl version too.

18:06.800 --> 18:10.140
Hyrule Legends introduced Linkle, who is explicitly female.

18:10.140 --> 18:14.440
In Breath of the Wild, Link is quite androgynous, and that carries over into Tears of the Kingdom.

18:14.440 --> 18:18.000
I guess, even though it's been five years, he hasn't yet suffered from twink death.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.000
Here's the thing.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.360
If Nintendo actually made Link canonically gay or trans or something in the next game,

18:23.360 --> 18:24.880
I don't think I'd care that much.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.280
Like I said, they've always played around with Link's design.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.100
They've played him off as androgynous, they've made him more masculine or more feminine.

18:30.100 --> 18:34.240
So making a gay Link or a trans Link or another girl Link, that would just be in line with

18:34.240 --> 18:35.240
what Nintendo seems to do.

18:35.240 --> 18:39.520
But, they haven't made him gay or trans yet, and the attempts to claim him just seem

18:39.520 --> 18:41.240
to be porn-induced cope.

18:41.240 --> 18:45.200
And because Nintendo hasn't bent to their whims yet, people are actually saying that

18:45.200 --> 18:49.920
it's homophobic or transphobic or some type of queerphobic that Link and Sidon aren't

18:49.920 --> 18:52.680
a thing, and that both have canon straight partners.

18:52.680 --> 18:56.760
In the same way that they said it was queerphobic, that Bayonetta and John were canonically revealed

18:56.760 --> 18:59.640
to not be a couple in Bayonetta 3 last fall.

18:59.640 --> 19:04.100
There's a lot more to this topic beyond just Zelda, that progressive machine that queers

19:04.100 --> 19:08.220
straight cis characters, and then demands that the authors and creators of those characters

19:08.220 --> 19:10.040
canonize their delusions.

19:10.040 --> 19:13.640
Let's start off with this legendary old Twitter thread from the Gamergate era.

19:13.640 --> 19:14.640
Ugh.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.500
They don't want us to take poison away from us, y'all.

19:16.500 --> 19:19.680
They don't want us to have Samus, they don't want us to have poison, fuck that.

19:19.680 --> 19:23.440
I'm not gonna be left in a world where the only single transgender woman treated with

19:23.440 --> 19:25.340
dignity in a game is Vivian.

19:25.340 --> 19:26.340
Fuck that.

19:26.340 --> 19:27.340
Samus is trans.

19:27.340 --> 19:28.340
Poison is trans.

19:28.340 --> 19:29.340
Link is trans.

19:29.340 --> 19:30.340
Zelda is trans.

19:30.340 --> 19:31.340
Tails is trans.

19:31.340 --> 19:32.340
Your faves are trans.

19:32.340 --> 19:33.340
That's it.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.340
I don't care about canon.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.600
I don't care about authorial intent.

19:35.600 --> 19:40.360
I demand queer representation, and I will subvert and take away your spaces.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.360
I don't give a fuck.

19:41.360 --> 19:43.240
This is revolutionary queerness.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.920
This is dismantling the pointless colonial binary.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.080
You can't have this.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.420
Here's a TLDR of what's going on here.

19:49.420 --> 19:53.000
Poison is, in the Japanese version of Final Fight, a woman and a common enemy that you

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
come across.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.320
Because, in Final Fight, you brutally beat the shit out of every enemy, when the game

19:58.320 --> 20:03.200
was localized to English in the 90s, the translators changed her character and made her into a

20:03.200 --> 20:07.840
cross-dressing man, at least in the dialogue, in order to avoid a violence against women

20:07.840 --> 20:10.720
in video games charge, which was all the rage back then.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.980
So in Japan, poison's a cis woman.

20:12.980 --> 20:15.500
In America, Poison is a cross-dressing man.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.940
But in neither version is she trans.

20:17.940 --> 20:22.040
Vivian is one of the three shadow sisters from Paper Mario the Thousand-Year Door.

20:22.040 --> 20:26.740
She is abused by her two older and uglier sisters, and she eventually joins Mario's

20:26.740 --> 20:29.160
side and fights against them and the other villains of the game.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.840
In the English localization, she's just a female character.

20:31.840 --> 20:35.300
In the original Japanese, she's an otakonoko, meaning male daughter.

20:35.300 --> 20:39.260
This isn't a trans identity, it's more like a man who cross-dresses and also takes

20:39.260 --> 20:41.380
up a feminine gender role, but is still a man.

20:41.380 --> 20:45.760
The joke is that despite not being female, Vivian is far more feminine than the other

20:45.760 --> 20:46.980
shadow sisters.

20:46.980 --> 20:51.220
And while the sisters abuse Vivian for being an otakonoko, Mario doesn't care one way

20:51.220 --> 20:52.220
or another.

20:52.220 --> 20:56.600
So in the original Japanese, she's an otakonoko, which some people think is trans, most people

20:56.600 --> 20:59.860
think it isn't, while in the English version, she's just a cis woman.

20:59.860 --> 21:04.260
Samus is the hero of the Metroid games, a genetically modified human female who is stronger

21:04.260 --> 21:06.020
and larger as a result.

21:06.020 --> 21:09.740
She wears power armor and fights aliens and giant monsters and robots.

21:09.740 --> 21:12.620
In the original game, it was hard to tell what Samus was.

21:12.620 --> 21:16.920
When you died, you got a brief flicker of the armor breaking and a vaguely female shape

21:16.920 --> 21:21.280
getting vaporized, but if you 100%ed the game, you got to see Samus out of her armor and

21:21.280 --> 21:22.700
waving at the player.

21:22.700 --> 21:27.420
Most kids back in the 90s thought Samus was a man or a robot, and only the true gamers

21:27.420 --> 21:28.480
knew she was a woman.

21:28.480 --> 21:32.900
In one interview, a background designer made the claim that Samus is trans as a joke, and

21:32.900 --> 21:36.660
the co-creator of Metroid later clarified that Samus is a cis woman.

21:36.660 --> 21:40.700
In fact, Samus was inspired by Ellen Ripley from 1979's Alien.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.300
You've of course already covered Link and Zelda.

21:43.300 --> 21:48.540
People think that Tails is trans because Tails, being a 12-year-old fox boy, is often voiced

21:48.540 --> 21:52.960
by a woman, and the online Sonic community is rife with gay furry porn.

21:52.960 --> 21:57.700
The point is, the revolutionary queerness that Katie-Bat is talking about consists of

21:57.700 --> 22:02.780
taking any and all characters who play with gender in any way, even if only a little bit,

22:02.780 --> 22:08.120
even if in only one version or one localization of the game, and declaring them as trans.

22:08.120 --> 22:12.780
Random characters are made trans with no real reasoning behind it, and Twitter laps it up

22:12.780 --> 22:13.860
as praxis.

22:13.860 --> 22:18.740
The most famous anime traps and cross-dressers are declared trans unilaterally, even as those

22:18.740 --> 22:21.500
characters call themselves boys or men.

22:21.500 --> 22:26.780
Naoto from Persona 4 is a tomboy who feels feminine desires and refers to herself as

22:26.780 --> 22:32.220
a girl, but nonetheless still chooses to adopt a more masculine appearance and behaviors.

22:32.220 --> 22:36.220
Those were so mad that she wasn't turned into a trans man in the western localization

22:36.220 --> 22:41.380
of the game that they made a mod for the PC version to do just that, completely missing

22:41.380 --> 22:43.060
the point of her character arc.

22:43.060 --> 22:47.260
Naoto's story is fundamentally a feminist one, that the professional workplace in Japan

22:47.260 --> 22:52.760
is so rife with sexism that talented, capable women who want to engage in that world feel

22:52.760 --> 22:56.040
forced to be more masculine than they actually are.

22:56.040 --> 23:01.820
Making Naoto a trans man is basically admitting defeat in the face of patriarchal oppression,

23:01.820 --> 23:06.380
saying that women actually have to become men, in the progressive transgender sense,

23:06.380 --> 23:08.580
in order to even have a career at all.

23:08.580 --> 23:11.280
And of course we've already discussed Cloud from Final Fantasy VII.

23:11.280 --> 23:15.260
Because he cross-dresses to sneak into a brothel, and isn't happy about it really, he's

23:15.260 --> 23:19.480
now trans, and there's almost as much porn of him as a bottom as there is of Link, because

23:19.480 --> 23:23.140
of the way the cross-dressing scene was made up during the modern remake of the game.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.220
Forget about video games though, what about movies?

23:25.220 --> 23:28.700
Indiana Jones has a strained relationship with his father, who refuses to call him by

23:28.700 --> 23:29.700
his chosen name?

23:29.700 --> 23:30.820
I guess Indy's trans now.

23:30.820 --> 23:31.820
How about comics?

23:31.820 --> 23:33.220
Let's make Harley Quinn trans.

23:33.220 --> 23:34.220
Why?

23:34.220 --> 23:35.220
Well, because she's mentally unstable.

23:35.220 --> 23:36.740
I guess that's enough for the progressives.

23:36.740 --> 23:37.840
This one's actually really funny.

23:37.840 --> 23:41.340
The idea that transness is a mental illness is transphobic, but now they're using mental

23:41.340 --> 23:43.940
illness as the primary marker of transness for Harley.

23:43.940 --> 23:45.780
Hey, how about real fucking people?

23:45.780 --> 23:50.420
James Allen, a woman who cross-dressed and presented as a man in order to hide her lesbian

23:50.420 --> 23:54.980
relationship, but who actually was a woman in private, has been reinvented as a trans

23:54.980 --> 23:56.700
man by modern activists.

23:56.700 --> 24:00.580
Joan of Arc, because she was a woman doing something that only men did in that era, is

24:00.580 --> 24:02.700
now also a trans icon.

24:02.700 --> 24:05.580
These characters, these people, they're not trans, what's actually happening here?

24:05.580 --> 24:08.500
It's a concept known as the trans umbrella.

24:08.500 --> 24:12.840
You probably know that the number of trans people is rising steadily right now.

24:12.840 --> 24:16.140
Part of that rise can be contributed to more people being out of the closet than before,

24:16.140 --> 24:19.100
whether that's because they're more educated about gender stuff now and they can come to

24:19.100 --> 24:22.980
the realization sooner, or because they have more affirming families and friends who won't

24:22.980 --> 24:24.380
cut them off for coming out.

24:24.380 --> 24:27.220
However, part of that rise can also be contributed to social contagion.

24:27.220 --> 24:31.660
In progressive areas, being trans now gives you social clout, and so we see more people

24:31.660 --> 24:36.260
in schools, particularly girls and young women, declaring themselves trans because they have

24:36.260 --> 24:40.260
short hair and wear jeans instead of dresses, and their teacher told them that that's what

24:40.260 --> 24:41.260
it meant.

24:41.260 --> 24:44.820
But another part of what's going on here can be due to the trans umbrella.

24:44.820 --> 24:47.460
When I was in school, when a woman was a tomboy, she was still a woman.

24:47.460 --> 24:49.620
A more masculine presenting woman, but still a woman.

24:49.620 --> 24:52.980
We had a similar thing for men, the pretty boys and the emo kids of the 2000s.

24:52.980 --> 24:55.940
And to go back even further, the metrosexuals of the 90s.

24:55.940 --> 25:00.180
This era was an expansion of possibilities regarding what you could do as a man or a

25:00.180 --> 25:01.180
woman.

25:01.180 --> 25:02.620
You could be a pretty man, you could be a tough woman.

25:02.620 --> 25:06.860
But with the rise of trans stuff, that progress has been rolled backwards.

25:06.860 --> 25:10.900
Now progressives have very strict gender roles, except that if you happen to align with a

25:10.900 --> 25:14.900
gender role that is not correlated with your birth sex, you're trans instead.

25:14.900 --> 25:18.220
So masculine women can't be tomboys anymore, they're trans men.

25:18.220 --> 25:21.420
Feminine men can't be femboys or traps anymore, they're trans women.

25:21.420 --> 25:25.860
And in fact, femboy or trap is considered a slur for trans women now, as part of erasing

25:25.860 --> 25:26.860
that identity.

25:26.860 --> 25:30.820
Before, there were many types of gender nonconformity that were accepted as different ways to be

25:30.820 --> 25:31.820
men or women.

25:31.820 --> 25:35.080
But now, all gender nonconformity is under the trans umbrella.

25:35.080 --> 25:39.500
This is why, to the trans activists, men who do any sort of gender bending are actually

25:39.500 --> 25:43.380
trans women who are still in their eggs, and they need to be hatched.

25:43.380 --> 25:46.760
That's a huge conversation, the egg hatching thing, it's not going to fit into this video.

25:46.760 --> 25:50.620
But the reason they're coming for fictional characters and historical figures is to normalize

25:50.620 --> 25:53.700
that process using entertainment media and culture.

25:53.700 --> 25:56.260
Samus is a cis woman doing something traditionally masculine.

25:56.260 --> 25:59.860
By my normie liberal 2000s era standard, she's a tomboy.

25:59.860 --> 26:04.100
Hell, in some games, she's actually presented as being downright motherly and feminine.

26:04.100 --> 26:07.740
But per the progressive modern standard, her engagement with a traditional masculine role

26:07.740 --> 26:09.060
makes her trans.

26:09.060 --> 26:12.300
Whether that's a trans man or a trans woman depends on which specific progressive you're

26:12.300 --> 26:14.080
talking to and what fetishes they have.

26:14.080 --> 26:18.740
In any case, she's some type of gender nonconforming and therefore she's trans now.

26:18.740 --> 26:22.860
Men and Vivian were crossdressers in one localization and cis women in another.

26:22.860 --> 26:27.800
But because they were some type of gender nonconforming somewhere, they're now trans.

26:27.800 --> 26:32.460
Because Link and Cloud are both crossdressed specifically to infiltrate somewhere and not

26:32.460 --> 26:35.800
because it's who they are, and the internet made a lot of porn out of it, they are some

26:35.800 --> 26:39.420
type of gender nonconforming and therefore they're trans now.

26:39.420 --> 26:42.680
Considering how long it took trans people to ditch the idea that they were just male

26:42.680 --> 26:46.700
crossdressers with a fetish, you'd think that trans activists turning all of these

26:46.700 --> 26:52.080
instances of male crossdressers into trans icons would be seen as extremely insulting.

26:52.080 --> 26:56.160
But the majority of trans activists aren't actually trans, they're either misguided

26:56.160 --> 26:58.640
allies or weird fetishists themselves.

26:58.640 --> 27:02.200
Of course, they'll obfuscate all this by saying, hey, it's just fan-made porn, it's

27:02.200 --> 27:04.760
just a headcanon, it's just entertainment, why do you care?

27:04.760 --> 27:06.280
Let people enjoy things.

27:06.280 --> 27:07.280
Sure, fair enough.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.720
But they're not saying that in good faith.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.280
That's just to get you to shut up.

27:10.280 --> 27:11.680
Why do I think this?

27:11.680 --> 27:14.960
This is Tracer, the star of Overwatch, the character on the cover.

27:14.960 --> 27:16.680
She is canonically a lesbian.

27:16.680 --> 27:21.140
There is tons of porn on the internet of Tracer getting dicked down, getting gangbanged,

27:21.140 --> 27:23.540
her and her GF sharing cock, all of it.

27:23.540 --> 27:27.820
There's so much Tracer porn out there that most people actually forget that she's exclusively

27:27.820 --> 27:32.740
lesbian in canon, and progressive Overwatch fans have screamed bloody murder about that

27:32.740 --> 27:33.740
for years.

27:33.740 --> 27:37.220
But hey, it's just entertainment, it's just headcanon, it's just porn, who cares?

27:37.220 --> 27:38.560
Well, they do.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.780
Because they don't think it's just entertainment.

27:40.780 --> 27:44.780
Even as they tell you that, everything is political, including normalization of values

27:44.780 --> 27:45.900
through pop culture.

27:45.900 --> 27:49.500
This example is about race, not gay or trans stuff, but it still fits the bill.

27:49.500 --> 27:52.920
When The Little Mermaid was race-swapped to be black, progressives told people that it's

27:52.920 --> 27:55.660
totally fine and to stop freaking out about a children's movie.

27:55.660 --> 28:00.360
But when an artist race-swapped The Little Mermaid back, she got lambasted for being

28:00.360 --> 28:01.360
racist.

28:01.360 --> 28:03.520
It's just a children's movie, what are you freaking out about?

28:03.520 --> 28:07.560
This double standard puts their actual goal on display, normalization.

28:07.560 --> 28:12.280
They view it as a culture war victory every time a character is canonically made trans,

28:12.280 --> 28:15.920
even if it completely destroys the character, like with the Bridgette fiasco from Guilty

28:15.920 --> 28:17.140
Gear last year.

28:17.140 --> 28:19.680
They do it because normalization brings power.

28:19.680 --> 28:23.480
My pal Arch talked at length about this tweet, where an activist demanded that Warhammer

28:23.480 --> 28:28.620
bring in female space marines, in violation of the lore and the fan's love for the series,

28:28.620 --> 28:32.320
because space marines are the main characters in the poster child.

28:32.320 --> 28:33.320
Representation is power.

28:33.320 --> 28:37.660
They use that power to normalize certain values in media as a part of a larger push to normalize

28:37.660 --> 28:39.380
those values in real life.

28:39.380 --> 28:43.700
They only care about manipulating popular femboy or trap or otherwise gender nonconforming

28:43.700 --> 28:48.060
characters in order to make them into trans icons as a part of that normalization and

28:48.060 --> 28:49.060
control.

28:49.060 --> 28:52.820
Positive, happy characters that are traps or femboys or hell just pass well when they

28:52.820 --> 28:54.240
cross-dress like Link.

28:54.240 --> 28:58.660
They are specifically targeted by activists because one, they're easy to pornify as

28:58.660 --> 29:03.240
trans, and two, because they're feminine men who are nonetheless happy with being men,

29:03.240 --> 29:05.440
something that trans activists hate.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.880
And this spills over into the treatment of real-life feminine men who are happy with

29:08.880 --> 29:09.880
being men.

29:09.880 --> 29:14.060
In order to accomplish this normalization, they do all of the weird stuff that rightoid

29:14.060 --> 29:15.740
transvestigators do.

29:15.740 --> 29:19.060
Look guys, there's a trans flag in the background, this character must be trans, look at her

29:19.060 --> 29:21.740
jaw shape guys, look at her hand, trans trans trans.

29:21.740 --> 29:22.740
This is all very weird.

29:22.740 --> 29:24.980
At the end of the day, it is just a video game.

29:24.980 --> 29:28.980
Zelda is a game in a canon that I care about, but like I said, if they made Link a girl

29:28.980 --> 29:32.180
or whatever next time around, I wouldn't care, as long as the game itself is good.

29:32.180 --> 29:34.980
It doesn't matter to me if they make Samus trans as long as the game is good.

29:34.980 --> 29:38.100
It doesn't matter if The Last of Us has gay characters as long as it's good, and

29:38.100 --> 29:39.200
the TV show wasn't.

29:39.200 --> 29:42.960
I personally don't care all that much, but I do know that their ultimate designs aren't

29:42.960 --> 29:43.960
on media.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.280
That's a means to an end.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.240
Their designs are on real people, something that we'll have to talk about next time.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.720
And that's a lot more important.

29:49.720 --> 29:53.480
Anyway, Tears of the Kingdom is a great game, Link is straight, Sidon is straight, Final

29:53.480 --> 29:56.960
Fantasy 16 only has white people in it, and the best games coming out nowadays don't

29:56.960 --> 29:58.440
give a shit about representation.

29:58.440 --> 29:59.440
Stay mad, faggots.
