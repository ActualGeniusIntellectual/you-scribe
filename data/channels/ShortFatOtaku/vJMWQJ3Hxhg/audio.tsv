0	13580	I have to come clean.
13580	17680	One big reason you haven't seen many videos from me is because The Legend of Zelda Tears
17680	20600	of the Kingdom came out and I've been doing nothing but playing that.
20600	24440	Now that's not the only reason, I've been doing a lot of E3 streams in the channel too.
24440	29160	Yes, E3 is dead in that the actual event in LA with the booths on the show floor?
29160	30160	That was killed by COVID.
30160	34240	But the E3 season still lives on in the minds of gamers, and the first half of June was
34240	37960	stuffed full of conferences by a bunch of game developers talking about what games are
37960	41920	coming up next, so I spent a lot of time doing prep and streaming those instead.
41920	46060	But the lion's share has been me goofing off with Tears of the Kingdom, yes.
46060	47060	How could I not?
47060	50520	I love Zelda as a series, I love Breath of the Wild, the game that Tears of the Kingdom
50520	54320	is a direct sequel to, and I am fully obsessed with Link's latest adventure.
54320	58120	I know that the Final Fantasy XVI demo was pretty awesome and Starfield also looks really
58120	61680	good, but I genuinely think that Zelda Tears of the Kingdom is going to win Game of the
61680	62680	Year 2023.
62680	65260	It's pretty much the perfect storm of old and new.
65260	69320	Breath of the Wild saw Link waking up after 100 years of stasis with no memories, in a
69320	71280	completely desolate Kingdom of Hyrule.
71280	75120	The various villages dotting the countryside had been destroyed, the great monuments to
75120	79940	Hyrule's royal family in ruins, Hyrule Castle, the seat of power of the entire country occupied
79940	81600	by Ganon's demon army.
81600	85320	Those habited areas that did survive were under siege, or they were cursed, or they
85320	86740	had some other problem afflicting them.
86740	89300	The tone of Breath of the Wild is loneliness.
89300	91740	When you played that game, you felt truly alone.
91740	95140	But the theme of the game is rebuilding after loss.
95140	98640	Link is a hero out of time, and as you recover his memories, you begin to understand what
98640	99640	that means.
99640	101820	All of his friends are gone, well, most of them.
101820	106760	The Zora, the fish people, serve as the Zelda series' elves, being long-lived and building
106760	109300	ornate domains hidden away from human eyes.
109300	113140	And Prince Sidon was a child before Link was put to sleep, and he is now an adult.
113140	116720	Aside from him, though, everyone and everything is gone, and the majority of the game revolves
116720	121040	around Link's relationship with civilization as both familiar and outsider.
121040	124720	You can meet with the descendants of Link's old friends, help them with their struggles,
124720	125720	and watch them grow.
125720	130760	You can bring bandits to justice, and beat back Ganon's army from formerly-habited areas.
130760	133400	You can explore ancient ruins and learn the truth of the past.
133400	136620	Hell, if you want the theme of Breath of the Wild wrapped up in a tidy bow for you, it's
136620	138520	the questline where you found Tarrytown.
138520	142080	The site that Tarrytown eventually gets built on was weird to me the first time I encountered
142080	143080	it.
143080	145760	It had a goddess statue at the center, like all towns do, but nothing else.
145800	149540	As you do quests for Hudson, a hard-working entrepreneur, you eventually help him found
149540	153840	his construction company, and they will build Tarrytown from the ground up around that lonely
153840	155120	goddess statue.
155120	158680	Upon the completion of Hudson's questline, Tarrytown becomes emblematic of the overall
158680	162060	theme of Breath of the Wild, rebuilding after a great loss.
162060	166440	In a political sense, it's both conservative, as a new Link in the great ongoing chain of
166440	171160	civilization, no pun intended, and it's progressive, as Tarrytown is specifically made up of members
171160	176340	from each of Hyrule's tribes, Human, Zora, Rito, Goron, and Gerudo, and they each bring
176340	179020	their own culture and practices to Tarrytown.
179020	182800	Loss is a moment in which both progressives and conservatives have a role to play, the
182800	185400	creation of the future and the honoring of the past.
185400	189000	Tears of the Kingdom is a direct continuation of Breath of the Wild, both in terms of story
189000	190600	and in terms of theme.
190600	193640	Five years have passed and the land is gradually being resettled.
193640	197280	Tarrytown is a thriving hub of innovation, and Hudson's construction company is now
197280	199440	a vital part of rebuilding Hyrule.
199440	203000	Other new villages are slowly popping up again now that the threat is gone, or it was
203000	204000	gone.
204000	206260	There's new problems to solve of course, it wouldn't be a Zelda game without villains
206260	209160	to fight, but Hyrule doesn't seem empty and deserted anymore.
209160	213120	It's under siege again, but this time people, normal people, not just heroes, are pushing
213120	214600	back against the threats.
214600	217560	This time the game feels optimistic, not desolate.
217560	219960	Like yes, things are pretty bad, but we can still do this.
219960	223520	Plus from a gameplay perspective, going back to old haunts is just a lot of fun.
223520	228280	Yeah, they added the sky islands and the underworld as two huge new locations you can visit, but
228280	232120	the surface world is the same as the Breath of the Wild map, with five years added onto
232120	233120	it.
233120	236760	Checking out how Tarrytown has grown, catching up with familiar faces from before, even remembering
236760	240660	noteworthy gameplay challenges like the Great Plateau or Eventide Island, and wondering
240660	242120	what's going on there now.
242120	245260	The world feels like it's grown as well, and if you love Breath of the Wild, Tears
245260	249060	of the Kingdom is full of those continuity moments that you've been waiting for.
249060	251200	Yes I know, my channel is not just a gaming channel.
251200	253120	I'm sure you're waiting for me to get to the point.
253120	255400	And also yes, I'm indulging myself a bit.
255440	258560	There's no other time I'd be able to gush about Tears of the Kingdom like this.
258560	259780	But okay, here's the point.
259780	263280	The reason the game is breaking sales records, and people are calling it the game of the
263280	267400	year, the best Zelda game ever, the best game of all time even, is because Nintendo actually
267400	272960	seems to care about the quality of their games, but also the quality of their franchises themselves.
272960	274240	Check out this article.
274240	276760	Developers agree that Zelda Tears of the Kingdom is a miracle.
276760	280780	What's going on here is that prominent Western developers like Josh Scherr, who worked as
280780	284940	Narrative Director on Naughty Dogs The Last of Us Part II, or Allison Lures, who worked
284980	289500	on Destiny 2, or Corey Brotherson, who worked for Sony before going indie, all expressed
289500	292780	shock and amazement at the stunning quality of Tears of the Kingdom.
292780	296700	Now I don't know what Corey Brotherson's actually done, and Destiny 2 has always been
296700	302180	mid ever since it was called Destiny 1, but I do know that The Last of Us Part II is universally
302180	303180	fan-panned.
303180	307620	It's a part of a long series of millennial-led media where established, beloved characters
307620	313000	and stories are brutally killed off or subverted by the new author's inserted favorite character
313000	315200	as a giant fuck you to the fans.
315200	319460	The creators of this new chapter in the story demand that fans side with their new focus,
319460	324580	when what tends to actually happen is that fans abandon the franchise for greener pastures.
324580	327680	Probably the most blatant example of what I'm talking about is the recent announcement
327680	332120	that Rey is coming back to Star Wars to rebuild the Jedi Order in a new series of movies,
332120	336100	which is exactly what Luke Skywalker's story should have been, and in fact was, before
336100	338560	Disney de-canonized the extended universe.
338560	342240	The message is clear, the new protectors of these properties, these universes, they want
342240	346740	the name, they want the icon, they want the status, they want the clout of those franchises,
346740	350960	but they want to use them as vehicles to tell their new stories rather than continue what
350960	352300	was laid down before.
352300	353480	Why is this?
353480	355020	Sometimes it's just hubris.
355020	356920	Sometimes though, it's to push a political message.
356920	359000	See my Antonio Gramsci video on that.
359000	360440	But not so with Nintendo.
360440	363400	When they make a game, you're pretty much guaranteed to get what you expect, for better
363400	364400	or worse.
364400	366720	Usually better, though as a Nintendfag I'm biased.
366720	369920	Mario is always going to be about an Italian plumber running around a set of themed worlds,
369920	374000	creating blocks, getting power-ups, beating back Bowser's minions, and saving the princess.
374000	377240	Sometimes you'll use fire powers, and sometimes you'll ride a dinosaur friend, and sometimes
377240	380040	you'll jump into paintings, and sometimes you'll use a water pack, and sometimes you'll
380040	383480	go to outer space, and sometimes you can throw your hat to possess enemies, but the game
383480	384740	is fundamentally the same.
384740	388360	The restriction on the core formula allows the experimentation of the other aspects to
388360	389360	really stand out.
389360	391920	The Legend of Zelda as a series is the same way.
391920	395060	Nintendo changes things all the time, but never in a way that feels like a betrayal.
395060	397940	In Ocarina of Time you travel through time and try to change the future.
397940	400860	In Majora's Mask you wear masks that grant you new powers.
400860	404020	In Wind Waker the kingdom is flooded and you sail around the ocean on a ship.
404020	407800	In Twilight Princess you explore an alternate dimension known as the Twilight Realm, exposure
407800	410740	to which turns Link into a wolf, which furries absolutely loved.
410740	414140	In Skyward Sword the game takes place on floating islands and you zip around in the back of
414140	418700	a huge bird, but in each of them the core of what makes Zelda Zelda is present.
418700	423200	Link is a hero, Zelda is a princess, Ganon is present in some way, either as Ganondorf,
423200	426940	his mortal form as the King of the Gerudo, or as the Demon King himself.
426940	430500	These three eternal characters represent the three virtues of the Triforce, courage,
430500	434300	wisdom and power, and the relationship between the three plays out in an appropriate manner
434300	435300	every game.
435300	439520	The changes make the games fun, but the continuity makes the games meaningful.
439520	442300	Even in small ways there's a lot of continuity in fact.
442300	446420	Breath of the Wild saw players really fear the Lionel, the most dangerous of the Dark
446420	447900	Lord's ground forces.
447900	451680	Standing at about 20 feet tall, thousands of pounds of muscle, Lionel's have the lower
451680	454780	body of a horse, the upper body of a man and the head of a lion.
454780	458500	They carry some of the best equipment in the game, steel swords forged in the lava
458500	463240	of Death Mountain larger than any claymore, bows with metal drawstrings that no human
463240	467260	could possibly pull back, firing multiple short spears every shot.
467260	470980	They're ridiculously hard to defeat, and YouTube is filled with many a video of new
470980	475140	players accidentally finding one, freaking out and getting completely destroyed.
475140	479340	Taking down a Lionel is considered a true feat, both in the lore and among players.
479340	483340	And Lionel's got their start back in the original 1986 game as these little guys.
483340	485300	Doesn't exactly inspire fear, does it?
485300	488620	But it's the continuity that matters, knowing that that's what they were then and this
488620	489620	is what they are now.
489620	490980	Here's what I mean.
490980	494740	Moblins are these little pig-dog goblin monsters that have been in pretty much every game.
494740	498260	Even if you aren't a Zelda fan, if I show you this picture and say, this is a Moblin,
498260	502860	you can probably understand intuitively that he's a basic low-level soldier in Ganon's
502860	503860	army.
503860	504860	Nothing too scary.
504860	506360	That's how you know you're dealing with something iconic.
506360	508700	The context comes with the design.
508700	512600	Moblin is an Anglicization of the original Japanese term, Mori Burin.
512600	516880	This is a portmanteau of the Japanese word mori, which means forest, and goberin, which
516880	520160	is a Japanese pronunciation of the English word goblin.
520160	522120	So Moblin literally means forest goblin.
522120	526840	If you've ever played Japanese RPGs, have you noticed how their orcs are often pigmen
526840	529220	and their kobolds are often wolfmen?
529220	534360	Even though in the West, orcs are green-skinned barbarians and kobolds are lizardmen or sometimes
534360	536500	ratmen like in the case of Warcraft.
536500	540840	In my video about Yoshi-P a few months back, I talked about the history of Western-style
540840	542260	fantasy in Japan.
542260	547760	How the earliest Western fantasy games based off of D&D like Ultima and Wizardry were hugely
547760	552760	popular in Japan and how they heavily influenced the first Japanese fantasy games Dragon Quest
552760	553760	and Final Fantasy.
553760	557900	In D&D First Edition, things weren't exactly clear on what was supposed to be what.
557900	563040	For example, these are official First Edition orc miniatures showing them to have pig-like
563040	564040	features.
564040	568140	When Ultima and Wizardry were created, exactly what orcs and kobolds looked like hadn't been
568140	572940	cemented in D&D or in terms of the wider culture yet, and they went off of the earliest
572940	575060	depictions, which changed in the West over time.
575060	579900	Newer Western games used these newer depictions from newer versions of D&D, but Japanese fantasy
579900	584060	games are directly descended from Wizardry and Ultima, which both used the old designs.
584060	588780	Further complicating the matter is that orc and goblin are used interchangeably when talking
588780	592420	about the creatures in Lord of the Rings, which D&D was based off of.
592420	596460	Future fantasy properties would differentiate them, again most notably Warcraft, where goblins
596460	600460	are tiny green midgets that evolved from an animalistic state due to their contact
600460	604460	with a rare powerful material, while orcs are aliens from another planet that evolved
604460	608060	from rock giants getting infected by a weird hive-mind spore.
608060	609700	Yeah, Warcraft lore is weird.
609700	614000	But in Japan, since their entire Western fantasy canon came from Ultima and Wizardry, orcs
614000	616500	and goblins remained as interchangeable terms.
616500	620820	It also helped that in Japanese mythology, there was a creature called the Butato, a
620820	624120	barbarian pig-man who wore armor and used spears.
624120	627840	The Butato look very similar to the original depiction of orcs in the first edition of
627840	632960	D&D, which is why in the Zelda series, the Moblins, forest goblins, have pig-like qualities
632960	637440	and use spears, and why orcs in other Japanese games and anime are pig-men.
637440	640840	When I said that Moblins are iconic earlier, this is what I was getting at.
640840	645920	Both Western and Japanese players look at the Moblin and instantly see all of this context,
645920	649100	if only subconsciously, and they immediately get what they're all about.
649100	653040	The two different types of players are seeing the Moblin in a different cultural context,
653040	656800	but due to the convergence of factors, they're nonetheless pulling out more or less the same
656800	657800	information.
657800	661200	And this state of affairs persists across all of the Zelda games, across all of the
661200	662240	Moblin designs.
662240	667520	And not just Moblins, but Darknuts, Wizrobes, Stalfos, Wallmasters, they've all got a
667520	672160	detailed origin story that can be understood through simple intuition, and each iteration
672160	675280	builds on the previous all the way up to the present day.
675280	679960	This is how you know that Nintendo is masterclass at what they do, and that they truly care
679960	680960	about their games.
681180	685320	It's this continuity of meaning that drives people back to Nintendo's games time and
685320	688980	again, and Zelda games in particular, something that can only be built up through decades
688980	689980	of iteration.
689980	693460	And unlike with, say, The Last of Us Part II, they haven't sacrificed all of that
693460	696460	denseness and meaning to serve as a political message.
696460	700800	And I think it's that lack of a political message that drives Western progressives to
700800	702760	desperately try to overlay one.
702760	706660	A guy I follow on Twitter, Manlit Thorin, great name by the way, compared Nintendo Woman
706660	711380	to PlayStation Woman, showing the scientist Pura from Zelda, and Bayonetta from, well,
711380	715540	Bayonetta, versus Aloy from Horizon and Abby from The Last of Us Part II.
715540	719020	Funnily enough, Aloy was actually more attractive in the previous game, she's not a 10 out
719020	722660	of 10 or anything, but they're making a more realistic post-apocalyptic tribal game,
722660	723660	so fair enough.
723660	726600	But they actually hit her with the ugly stick for the sequel.
726600	730660	The point here is that Nintendo isn't afraid to put in attractive characters into their
730660	734660	games, even if they're in an anime style like Pura, while Sony is on this kick of
734660	736660	normalizing ugly characters.
736660	740660	This is just hilarious to me as a 90s kid, because back then it was the other way around.
740660	745980	Nintendo was very puritan about both sex and violence, while Sony was courting that edgy
745980	749100	90s crowd by leaning into exactly those things.
749100	752580	What's going on here is representation, a topic that I'm going to have to do a deep
752580	753580	dive on eventually.
753580	757540	Yes, Sargon, I picked up Pitkin's book on the subject, it's on the list.
757540	761380	Attractive women in media, like Pura or Bayonetta, are the norm.
761380	763480	Non-attractive women like Aloy or Abby aren't.
763480	767800	So in the name of equality, progressive logic insists that we should be normalizing non-attractive
767800	769280	women taking center stage.
769280	773320	The most recent video game related instance of this happening was Fable's reveal during
773320	776160	E3, and it went down about as you can expect.
776160	780520	Ugly female character went viral, fan artists made her more attractive, progressives shit
780520	782280	themselves over it.
782280	786400	Horizon and The Last of Us are made specifically with progressive politics in mind, at least
786400	787400	partially.
787400	790500	This is why people generally aren't running around on Twitter or Tumblr making up head
790500	794020	cannons or screaming about how everything is political and so these games must also
794020	795020	be political.
795020	796020	We already know that they are.
796020	800140	Frankly, it's why the libertarian gay romance at The Last of Us TV show didn't actually
800140	803540	bother non-leftists all that much, at least for the gay thing anyway.
803540	806540	The episode was actually a huge waste of time and didn't progress the story at all, but
806540	811100	we expected it because that's what The Last of Us is, because Bill and Frank were gay
811100	812580	in the original story.
812580	817240	However, because Bayonetta and Zelda aren't made with political themes in mind, you see
817240	820300	the Progs desperately trying to make them political.
820300	823720	I covered this article on a past Weekly Sip, so we don't need to go too much into detail
823720	824720	with it.
824720	825800	Plus, it's also really cancerous.
825800	830020	From our friends over at Polygon, Link is a gay icon and Zelda fans know it.
830020	833260	The Legend of Zelda's queer themes are more than just subtext.
833260	836980	This is the kind of article you write when a property doesn't actually have queer themes
836980	840700	and you desperately have to spin it as if it does, in order to bring it into the progressive
840700	841700	fold.
841700	844940	No one writes articles like this about Horizon or The Last of Us, because there's no work
844940	847740	to be done there to whitewash them as overtly woke.
847740	851080	They already are, but because Zelda is not, they have to make it so.
851080	853980	The examples given by the Progs are weak ones, of course.
853980	858300	Some people have tried to spin two side characters, a master archaeologist and his apprentice,
858300	862420	as being in a gay relationship, but that questline shows that while there's a lot of professional
862420	865740	admiration there, it's not romantic, and you really have to squint your eyes to make
865740	869380	the claim that this is the first gay character of the series.
869380	874420	Some fans and shippers have also paired up Link with the post-100 year slumber aged up
874420	877300	Prince Sidon due to their banter in Breath of the Wild.
877300	881060	But Tears of the Kingdom has us return to Hyrule to meet Sidon's fiancée, and the
881060	883140	Progs are not happy about it.
883140	884900	Listen, he's the prince of the Zora.
884900	889340	Why did you think he wasn't going to carry on his bloodline with a proper fish girl and
889340	892380	instead engage in a gay interspecies relationship?
892380	897340	And of course, Zelda's voice actress confirmed that Link and Zelda are, in fact, in a heterosexual
897340	900900	relationship this time around, which can be corroborated in-game.
900900	904340	In Breath of the Wild, you can actually save up and buy a house in Hateno Village.
904340	907740	If you return to that house in Tears of the Kingdom, you'll find signs that Link and
907740	910420	Zelda both live there together as a couple.
910420	915060	Not every game makes Link and Zelda's relationship explicitly romantic.
915060	918740	While they certainly are in Skyward Sword, in Wind Waker they're more like friends,
918740	923020	and in Twilight Princess, Link's romantic arc is clearly with Midna, the princess of
923020	924080	the Twilight Realm.
924080	927940	But this time around, in the Breath of the Wild continuity, they are officially together.
927940	932580	The most diehard fan theory, and the one that almost all of the online Link pornography
932580	937920	revolves around, is the idea that Link is gay or trans or both or something.
937920	941760	In Breath of the Wild, the Gerudo City is a woman-only location, as the Gerudo are a
941760	943300	woman-only species.
943300	946500	The women of other races are allowed in, but not the men.
946500	949940	Gorons are allowed in because they're gender neutral, even though most Gorons look pretty
949940	950940	masculine.
950940	953980	And one of the Gorons inside the city is actually really confused about the whole affair.
953980	957860	But Link has to go into the city as part of the main story, so you have the opportunity
957860	959620	to cross-dress.
959660	962660	Final Fantasy VII comedy has been a staple in Japanese entertainment for as long as I
962660	963660	can remember.
963660	967540	There's the famous brothel scene in Final Fantasy VII, countless anime have done jokes
967540	968540	about it.
968540	972780	Hell, I played Star Tropics on my dad's old NES when I was like five years old, and
972780	975900	there was a scene there where the hero had to cross-dress for a mission.
975900	979600	All of the usual jokes apply, like almost getting caught while you're undercover,
979600	982860	or getting hit on by straight men who don't know that you're not a girl.
982860	986180	It's played for laughs, and it's embarrassing and uncomfortable for the characters involved,
986180	988340	but it's never portrayed as hateful.
988340	991200	In Breath of the Wild, even if you choose to tell the cross-dressing man you can buy
991200	995820	the clothes from that you can see he's a he, that doesn't lead to trans violence,
995820	998460	regardless of what the mouth-breathers at Polygon say.
998460	1002620	The Japanese still have a sense of humor about gender-bendy stuff, and it's honestly refreshing
1002620	1005420	to not feel constantly policed on the topic.
1005420	1010480	But it's this scene that has spawned tons of gay and trans Link porn.
1010480	1015020	From Link transitioning, to Link bottoming for Hyrule soldiers, to Link and Zelda both
1015020	1019940	fucking Ganon, to Link getting kidnapped and gang-raped by the Yiga, this stuff is
1019940	1024020	all over the internet, and it's gotten to the point that the progs are taking it as
1024020	1025020	canon.
1025020	1027040	It's not, though, their brains are just porn-addled.
1027040	1031100	In an interview with Time Magazine, Zelda head honcho Eiji Aonoma said,
1031100	1036300	Back during the Ocarina of Time days, that was 1998, I wanted Link to be gender-neutral.
1036300	1039340	I wanted the player to think, maybe Link is a boy or a girl.
1039340	1042300	If you saw Link as a guy, he'd have more of a feminine touch.
1042300	1043300	Or vice versa.
1043300	1046180	If you saw Link as a girl, it was with more of a masculine aspect.
1046180	1049980	I really wanted the designer to encompass more of a gender-neutral figure, so I've
1049980	1054060	always thought that for either female or male players, I wanted them to be able to relate
1054060	1055060	to Link.
1055060	1056060	And yeah, that makes sense.
1056060	1058900	In Ocarina of Time, you play as both child Link and adult Link.
1058900	1061800	Child Link is more feminine, and adult Link is more masculine.
1061800	1064460	In Wind Waker, Link is a child and he's very cartoony.
1064460	1068300	In Twilight Princess, Link is a bit more realistic, and probably the most masculine we've ever
1068300	1069300	seen him.
1069300	1073240	In Skyward Sword, though, Link's got an almost exaggeratedly feminine face.
1073240	1076520	In Link's Awakening, at least the remake, he's a diorama toy.
1076520	1080360	Nintendo has had no problem with drastically changing the style of Zelda games over the
1080360	1081360	years.
1081360	1084600	And that includes both Link's age and his gendered features.
1084600	1086800	And yes, there's also been a girl version too.
1086800	1090140	Hyrule Legends introduced Linkle, who is explicitly female.
1090140	1094440	In Breath of the Wild, Link is quite androgynous, and that carries over into Tears of the Kingdom.
1094440	1098000	I guess, even though it's been five years, he hasn't yet suffered from twink death.
1098000	1099000	Here's the thing.
1099000	1103360	If Nintendo actually made Link canonically gay or trans or something in the next game,
1103360	1104880	I don't think I'd care that much.
1104880	1107280	Like I said, they've always played around with Link's design.
1107280	1110100	They've played him off as androgynous, they've made him more masculine or more feminine.
1110100	1114240	So making a gay Link or a trans Link or another girl Link, that would just be in line with
1114240	1115240	what Nintendo seems to do.
1115240	1119520	But, they haven't made him gay or trans yet, and the attempts to claim him just seem
1119520	1121240	to be porn-induced cope.
1121240	1125200	And because Nintendo hasn't bent to their whims yet, people are actually saying that
1125200	1129920	it's homophobic or transphobic or some type of queerphobic that Link and Sidon aren't
1129920	1132680	a thing, and that both have canon straight partners.
1132680	1136760	In the same way that they said it was queerphobic, that Bayonetta and John were canonically revealed
1136760	1139640	to not be a couple in Bayonetta 3 last fall.
1139640	1144100	There's a lot more to this topic beyond just Zelda, that progressive machine that queers
1144100	1148220	straight cis characters, and then demands that the authors and creators of those characters
1148220	1150040	canonize their delusions.
1150040	1153640	Let's start off with this legendary old Twitter thread from the Gamergate era.
1153640	1154640	Ugh.
1154640	1156500	They don't want us to take poison away from us, y'all.
1156500	1159680	They don't want us to have Samus, they don't want us to have poison, fuck that.
1159680	1163440	I'm not gonna be left in a world where the only single transgender woman treated with
1163440	1165340	dignity in a game is Vivian.
1165340	1166340	Fuck that.
1166340	1167340	Samus is trans.
1167340	1168340	Poison is trans.
1168340	1169340	Link is trans.
1169340	1170340	Zelda is trans.
1170340	1171340	Tails is trans.
1171340	1172340	Your faves are trans.
1172340	1173340	That's it.
1173340	1174340	I don't care about canon.
1174340	1175600	I don't care about authorial intent.
1175600	1180360	I demand queer representation, and I will subvert and take away your spaces.
1180360	1181360	I don't give a fuck.
1181360	1183240	This is revolutionary queerness.
1183240	1185920	This is dismantling the pointless colonial binary.
1185920	1187080	You can't have this.
1187080	1189420	Here's a TLDR of what's going on here.
1189420	1193000	Poison is, in the Japanese version of Final Fight, a woman and a common enemy that you
1193000	1194000	come across.
1194000	1198320	Because, in Final Fight, you brutally beat the shit out of every enemy, when the game
1198320	1203200	was localized to English in the 90s, the translators changed her character and made her into a
1203200	1207840	cross-dressing man, at least in the dialogue, in order to avoid a violence against women
1207840	1210720	in video games charge, which was all the rage back then.
1210720	1212980	So in Japan, poison's a cis woman.
1212980	1215500	In America, Poison is a cross-dressing man.
1215500	1217940	But in neither version is she trans.
1217940	1222040	Vivian is one of the three shadow sisters from Paper Mario the Thousand-Year Door.
1222040	1226740	She is abused by her two older and uglier sisters, and she eventually joins Mario's
1226740	1229160	side and fights against them and the other villains of the game.
1229160	1231840	In the English localization, she's just a female character.
1231840	1235300	In the original Japanese, she's an otakonoko, meaning male daughter.
1235300	1239260	This isn't a trans identity, it's more like a man who cross-dresses and also takes
1239260	1241380	up a feminine gender role, but is still a man.
1241380	1245760	The joke is that despite not being female, Vivian is far more feminine than the other
1245760	1246980	shadow sisters.
1246980	1251220	And while the sisters abuse Vivian for being an otakonoko, Mario doesn't care one way
1251220	1252220	or another.
1252220	1256600	So in the original Japanese, she's an otakonoko, which some people think is trans, most people
1256600	1259860	think it isn't, while in the English version, she's just a cis woman.
1259860	1264260	Samus is the hero of the Metroid games, a genetically modified human female who is stronger
1264260	1266020	and larger as a result.
1266020	1269740	She wears power armor and fights aliens and giant monsters and robots.
1269740	1272620	In the original game, it was hard to tell what Samus was.
1272620	1276920	When you died, you got a brief flicker of the armor breaking and a vaguely female shape
1276920	1281280	getting vaporized, but if you 100%ed the game, you got to see Samus out of her armor and
1281280	1282700	waving at the player.
1282700	1287420	Most kids back in the 90s thought Samus was a man or a robot, and only the true gamers
1287420	1288480	knew she was a woman.
1288480	1292900	In one interview, a background designer made the claim that Samus is trans as a joke, and
1292900	1296660	the co-creator of Metroid later clarified that Samus is a cis woman.
1296660	1300700	In fact, Samus was inspired by Ellen Ripley from 1979's Alien.
1300700	1303300	You've of course already covered Link and Zelda.
1303300	1308540	People think that Tails is trans because Tails, being a 12-year-old fox boy, is often voiced
1308540	1312960	by a woman, and the online Sonic community is rife with gay furry porn.
1312960	1317700	The point is, the revolutionary queerness that Katie-Bat is talking about consists of
1317700	1322780	taking any and all characters who play with gender in any way, even if only a little bit,
1322780	1328120	even if in only one version or one localization of the game, and declaring them as trans.
1328120	1332780	Random characters are made trans with no real reasoning behind it, and Twitter laps it up
1332780	1333860	as praxis.
1333860	1338740	The most famous anime traps and cross-dressers are declared trans unilaterally, even as those
1338740	1341500	characters call themselves boys or men.
1341500	1346780	Naoto from Persona 4 is a tomboy who feels feminine desires and refers to herself as
1346780	1352220	a girl, but nonetheless still chooses to adopt a more masculine appearance and behaviors.
1352220	1356220	Those were so mad that she wasn't turned into a trans man in the western localization
1356220	1361380	of the game that they made a mod for the PC version to do just that, completely missing
1361380	1363060	the point of her character arc.
1363060	1367260	Naoto's story is fundamentally a feminist one, that the professional workplace in Japan
1367260	1372760	is so rife with sexism that talented, capable women who want to engage in that world feel
1372760	1376040	forced to be more masculine than they actually are.
1376040	1381820	Making Naoto a trans man is basically admitting defeat in the face of patriarchal oppression,
1381820	1386380	saying that women actually have to become men, in the progressive transgender sense,
1386380	1388580	in order to even have a career at all.
1388580	1391280	And of course we've already discussed Cloud from Final Fantasy VII.
1391280	1395260	Because he cross-dresses to sneak into a brothel, and isn't happy about it really, he's
1395260	1399480	now trans, and there's almost as much porn of him as a bottom as there is of Link, because
1399480	1403140	of the way the cross-dressing scene was made up during the modern remake of the game.
1403140	1405220	Forget about video games though, what about movies?
1405220	1408700	Indiana Jones has a strained relationship with his father, who refuses to call him by
1408700	1409700	his chosen name?
1409700	1410820	I guess Indy's trans now.
1410820	1411820	How about comics?
1411820	1413220	Let's make Harley Quinn trans.
1413220	1414220	Why?
1414220	1415220	Well, because she's mentally unstable.
1415220	1416740	I guess that's enough for the progressives.
1416740	1417840	This one's actually really funny.
1417840	1421340	The idea that transness is a mental illness is transphobic, but now they're using mental
1421340	1423940	illness as the primary marker of transness for Harley.
1423940	1425780	Hey, how about real fucking people?
1425780	1430420	James Allen, a woman who cross-dressed and presented as a man in order to hide her lesbian
1430420	1434980	relationship, but who actually was a woman in private, has been reinvented as a trans
1434980	1436700	man by modern activists.
1436700	1440580	Joan of Arc, because she was a woman doing something that only men did in that era, is
1440580	1442700	now also a trans icon.
1442700	1445580	These characters, these people, they're not trans, what's actually happening here?
1445580	1448500	It's a concept known as the trans umbrella.
1448500	1452840	You probably know that the number of trans people is rising steadily right now.
1452840	1456140	Part of that rise can be contributed to more people being out of the closet than before,
1456140	1459100	whether that's because they're more educated about gender stuff now and they can come to
1459100	1462980	the realization sooner, or because they have more affirming families and friends who won't
1462980	1464380	cut them off for coming out.
1464380	1467220	However, part of that rise can also be contributed to social contagion.
1467220	1471660	In progressive areas, being trans now gives you social clout, and so we see more people
1471660	1476260	in schools, particularly girls and young women, declaring themselves trans because they have
1476260	1480260	short hair and wear jeans instead of dresses, and their teacher told them that that's what
1480260	1481260	it meant.
1481260	1484820	But another part of what's going on here can be due to the trans umbrella.
1484820	1487460	When I was in school, when a woman was a tomboy, she was still a woman.
1487460	1489620	A more masculine presenting woman, but still a woman.
1489620	1492980	We had a similar thing for men, the pretty boys and the emo kids of the 2000s.
1492980	1495940	And to go back even further, the metrosexuals of the 90s.
1495940	1500180	This era was an expansion of possibilities regarding what you could do as a man or a
1500180	1501180	woman.
1501180	1502620	You could be a pretty man, you could be a tough woman.
1502620	1506860	But with the rise of trans stuff, that progress has been rolled backwards.
1506860	1510900	Now progressives have very strict gender roles, except that if you happen to align with a
1510900	1514900	gender role that is not correlated with your birth sex, you're trans instead.
1514900	1518220	So masculine women can't be tomboys anymore, they're trans men.
1518220	1521420	Feminine men can't be femboys or traps anymore, they're trans women.
1521420	1525860	And in fact, femboy or trap is considered a slur for trans women now, as part of erasing
1525860	1526860	that identity.
1526860	1530820	Before, there were many types of gender nonconformity that were accepted as different ways to be
1530820	1531820	men or women.
1531820	1535080	But now, all gender nonconformity is under the trans umbrella.
1535080	1539500	This is why, to the trans activists, men who do any sort of gender bending are actually
1539500	1543380	trans women who are still in their eggs, and they need to be hatched.
1543380	1546760	That's a huge conversation, the egg hatching thing, it's not going to fit into this video.
1546760	1550620	But the reason they're coming for fictional characters and historical figures is to normalize
1550620	1553700	that process using entertainment media and culture.
1553700	1556260	Samus is a cis woman doing something traditionally masculine.
1556260	1559860	By my normie liberal 2000s era standard, she's a tomboy.
1559860	1564100	Hell, in some games, she's actually presented as being downright motherly and feminine.
1564100	1567740	But per the progressive modern standard, her engagement with a traditional masculine role
1567740	1569060	makes her trans.
1569060	1572300	Whether that's a trans man or a trans woman depends on which specific progressive you're
1572300	1574080	talking to and what fetishes they have.
1574080	1578740	In any case, she's some type of gender nonconforming and therefore she's trans now.
1578740	1582860	Men and Vivian were crossdressers in one localization and cis women in another.
1582860	1587800	But because they were some type of gender nonconforming somewhere, they're now trans.
1587800	1592460	Because Link and Cloud are both crossdressed specifically to infiltrate somewhere and not
1592460	1595800	because it's who they are, and the internet made a lot of porn out of it, they are some
1595800	1599420	type of gender nonconforming and therefore they're trans now.
1599420	1602680	Considering how long it took trans people to ditch the idea that they were just male
1602680	1606700	crossdressers with a fetish, you'd think that trans activists turning all of these
1606700	1612080	instances of male crossdressers into trans icons would be seen as extremely insulting.
1612080	1616160	But the majority of trans activists aren't actually trans, they're either misguided
1616160	1618640	allies or weird fetishists themselves.
1618640	1622200	Of course, they'll obfuscate all this by saying, hey, it's just fan-made porn, it's
1622200	1624760	just a headcanon, it's just entertainment, why do you care?
1624760	1626280	Let people enjoy things.
1626280	1627280	Sure, fair enough.
1627280	1628720	But they're not saying that in good faith.
1628720	1630280	That's just to get you to shut up.
1630280	1631680	Why do I think this?
1631680	1634960	This is Tracer, the star of Overwatch, the character on the cover.
1634960	1636680	She is canonically a lesbian.
1636680	1641140	There is tons of porn on the internet of Tracer getting dicked down, getting gangbanged,
1641140	1643540	her and her GF sharing cock, all of it.
1643540	1647820	There's so much Tracer porn out there that most people actually forget that she's exclusively
1647820	1652740	lesbian in canon, and progressive Overwatch fans have screamed bloody murder about that
1652740	1653740	for years.
1653740	1657220	But hey, it's just entertainment, it's just headcanon, it's just porn, who cares?
1657220	1658560	Well, they do.
1658560	1660780	Because they don't think it's just entertainment.
1660780	1664780	Even as they tell you that, everything is political, including normalization of values
1664780	1665900	through pop culture.
1665900	1669500	This example is about race, not gay or trans stuff, but it still fits the bill.
1669500	1672920	When The Little Mermaid was race-swapped to be black, progressives told people that it's
1672920	1675660	totally fine and to stop freaking out about a children's movie.
1675660	1680360	But when an artist race-swapped The Little Mermaid back, she got lambasted for being
1680360	1681360	racist.
1681360	1683520	It's just a children's movie, what are you freaking out about?
1683520	1687560	This double standard puts their actual goal on display, normalization.
1687560	1692280	They view it as a culture war victory every time a character is canonically made trans,
1692280	1695920	even if it completely destroys the character, like with the Bridgette fiasco from Guilty
1695920	1697140	Gear last year.
1697140	1699680	They do it because normalization brings power.
1699680	1703480	My pal Arch talked at length about this tweet, where an activist demanded that Warhammer
1703480	1708620	bring in female space marines, in violation of the lore and the fan's love for the series,
1708620	1712320	because space marines are the main characters in the poster child.
1712320	1713320	Representation is power.
1713320	1717660	They use that power to normalize certain values in media as a part of a larger push to normalize
1717660	1719380	those values in real life.
1719380	1723700	They only care about manipulating popular femboy or trap or otherwise gender nonconforming
1723700	1728060	characters in order to make them into trans icons as a part of that normalization and
1728060	1729060	control.
1729060	1732820	Positive, happy characters that are traps or femboys or hell just pass well when they
1732820	1734240	cross-dress like Link.
1734240	1738660	They are specifically targeted by activists because one, they're easy to pornify as
1738660	1743240	trans, and two, because they're feminine men who are nonetheless happy with being men,
1743240	1745440	something that trans activists hate.
1745440	1748880	And this spills over into the treatment of real-life feminine men who are happy with
1748880	1749880	being men.
1749880	1754060	In order to accomplish this normalization, they do all of the weird stuff that rightoid
1754060	1755740	transvestigators do.
1755740	1759060	Look guys, there's a trans flag in the background, this character must be trans, look at her
1759060	1761740	jaw shape guys, look at her hand, trans trans trans.
1761740	1762740	This is all very weird.
1762740	1764980	At the end of the day, it is just a video game.
1764980	1768980	Zelda is a game in a canon that I care about, but like I said, if they made Link a girl
1768980	1772180	or whatever next time around, I wouldn't care, as long as the game itself is good.
1772180	1774980	It doesn't matter to me if they make Samus trans as long as the game is good.
1774980	1778100	It doesn't matter if The Last of Us has gay characters as long as it's good, and
1778100	1779200	the TV show wasn't.
1779200	1782960	I personally don't care all that much, but I do know that their ultimate designs aren't
1782960	1783960	on media.
1783960	1785280	That's a means to an end.
1785280	1788240	Their designs are on real people, something that we'll have to talk about next time.
1788240	1789720	And that's a lot more important.
1789720	1793480	Anyway, Tears of the Kingdom is a great game, Link is straight, Sidon is straight, Final
1793480	1796960	Fantasy 16 only has white people in it, and the best games coming out nowadays don't
1796960	1798440	give a shit about representation.
1798440	1799440	Stay mad, faggots.
