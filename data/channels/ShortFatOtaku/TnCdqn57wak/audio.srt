1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
When I was watching all of that Patrice Khan colors stuff for yesterday's video,

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,640
I came across this clip during one of her interviews.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:18,200
Who's being impacted the most by COVID-19? The poor. Who's being impacted the most by COVID-19?

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,280
Black folks, Latinx folks.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,280
Yeah, this is how I know she's fake. Only astroturfed politically correct talking

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:30,960
heads actually use Latinx. Latinx as a term is a bastardization of Latina and Latino. Spanish,

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,160
being a more gendered language than English, uses these two terms to refer to the male and

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,320
female forms of Latin individual, adding X as an English neologism. In the English language,

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,760
X is often used to refer to an unknown variable, a practice that got its start in mathematics.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,680
It later made the jump over to pop culture in the 80s and 90s to refer to something that is just

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,680
not known. See Mega Man games happening in 2000X, for example. Yeah, it turned out that it doesn't

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,400
matter what number you put in there. We didn't have robot shotas at all in the 2000s. Maybe

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,120
Mega Man X will be more on the nose. They use 20XDX. The usage here is that it's some

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,120
unknown time in the future. It's a deliberate vagueness of when the events take place. The

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,400
purpose of it allows the author to buy themselves a bit more time and extend the realism of the

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,480
story. Oh, it's 2022 and that future event didn't happen? Well, rather than writing 2022,

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,920
if you write 20XDX, it can happen anytime between now and 2099, extending the plausibility of the

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,320
story. This is ultimately the problem with Star Trek's canon. When the show debuted in the 60s,

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,640
it made sense that the eugenics wars happened in the 1990s and the third world war happened

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,920
in the 2040s. But nowadays, it seems kind of absurd. Though, if you listen to enough Tim

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,760
Poole, it sounds like you might still get that third world war. Cross your fingers for a nuclear

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,940
holocaust, Trekkies. But the use of X to refer to unknown data filtered down into LatinX. If you

23
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:50,260
wanted to talk about a crowd of Latino and Latina people, the progressives would demand that you use

24
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,100
LatinX as a simple shorthand since saying Latino and Latina was kind of clunky. After the rising

25
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,380
popularity of trans activism in the early 2010s, and more recently, the direct co-opting of that

26
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,420
movement by non-binary, genderqueer, and like, weird, dear gender people, the X in LatinX began

27
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,540
to refer to people who did not view themselves as Latino or Latina. And so, LatinX began to be

28
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,860
pushed not only for use to identify a mixed gender crowd, but to include other gender identities as

29
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,900
well. Unfortunately, it turns out that the vast majority of LatinX people fucking hate the term.

30
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,340
Poole finds LatinX people don't like to be called LatinX. Despite this monumental effort to be

31
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,580
inclusive, it may fall on deaf ears, at least with LatinX voters. A recent survey conducted by market

32
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,220
research agency Think Now found that nearly half, 44%, of LatinX people polled prefer the term

33
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,940
Hispanic, which somebody, maybe Elizabeth Warren, should probably tell them is extremely problematic

34
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,860
due to its imperialist origins. 24% of respondents preferred Latino or Latina, also problematic.

35
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,020
11% preferred the name of their country of origin, 7% preferred their country of origin plus American,

36
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,300
6% preferred just American, 5% preferred Chicano and Chicana, and just 2% of respondents preferred

37
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,700
the term LatinX. This is always the case, isn't it? Progressives at the top claim to speak for a

38
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,980
whole class of people while that class actually rejects them. Socialists for the working class,

39
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,260
BLM for black people, and now this. This was steady across all demographics. We went into it

40
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,940
with the hypothesis that awareness was always going to be lower than social media makes it

41
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,380
seem, said Mario Xavier Carraso, the co-founder of Think Now. We didn't think it was going to be as

42
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,020
low as it is. We also thought that it was going to be significantly more popular among young people

43
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,380
and it's not. There's no significant difference there. In fact, the researchers found that just

44
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:38,460
3% of the respondents under 35 preferred LatinX and 97% preferred anything else. Clearly the

45
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,140
progressive media establishment and the Democratic candidates for president have a lot more educating

46
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,180
to do. Um, is this a parody article? I can't tell. To me, it kind of sounds like it, but I wouldn't

47
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,020
actually put it past a prog writer to unironically say something like, we need to educate the dirty

48
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,300
unwashed LatinX underclass to accept our proper progressive inclusive framing. Carraso says

49
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,420
they're going to follow up the survey with another one asking if LatinX people are actually offended

50
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,980
by this term or if they're just unaware of it. But for some, including Giancarlo Sopo,

51
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,100
a contributor to USA Today, the answer is obvious. It's offensive. Gender non-conforming Americans

52
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,860
should be treated with compassion and respect, he wrote. If someone wants to be called LatinX,

53
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,300
that's fine, but the label should not be forced upon all Latinos. Hispanic Americans face plenty

54
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,980
of challenges. The last thing we need are progressives woke-splaining how to speak

55
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,260
Spanish. And this is the core of the problem. Most people view this as an English colonization

56
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,340
of the Spanish language. It's an English practice to put X to refer to an unknown variable. Neopronouns

57
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,780
are an English phenomenon. LatinX is unpronounceable in Spanish because X is used differently. That's

58
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,660
why they say Mexico and not Mexico. X conjugates with a previous vowel to make a new sound. Conjugates?

59
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,700
That's with verbs. I don't know. Do you know what I mean? When a vowel's sound changes because of

60
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,300
other continents and vowels around, you know what I'm talking about. The point is, unlike Mexico,

61
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,180
there's no previous vowel in LatinX. The letter is an N, so it just doesn't work. Hispanics don't

62
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,820
view LatinX as inclusive. They view it as colonialism. Hell, not even English people

63
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,540
like it. During the RadFem days, 10 to 15 years ago, there was a push to use a Womxn as well as

64
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,140
Womyn, you know, women with a Y, to distinguish woman from man. The idea being that woman is a

65
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,340
root of the word man in English, but women should be their own strong, beautiful, powerful class,

66
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,620
not defined in relation to men, but fierce on their own right. But nowadays, Womxn is used to

67
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,580
include trans women in the name of inclusivity. And most trans women fucking hate it. Nobody wants

68
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,260
this progressive bullshit. But if you object, of course, you're transphobic, right? The joke

69
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,420
has become so widespread that we're now seeing Italian X in response to it. There's been a

70
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,940
pretty prolific meme that Italians aren't actually white people, generally referring to how Italians

71
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,660
and the Irish as well were treated in the United States shortly after a large migration of their

72
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,660
population there, as well as the idea that there was a gradual intermixing between the Southern

73
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,340
Europeans and the African and Arab populations due to the history of the Mediterranean Sea. As

74
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,500
a very generalized statement, Southern Europeans have more Mediterranean physical features than

75
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,660
what was considered white at the time, which was the Northern and Central European standard you

76
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,020
could find in Britain, France, Germany, and the Nordic countries. In the United States, however,

77
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,780
Irish and Italians gradually integrated and became accepted as white. And frankly, the same process

78
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,980
is happening now to a lot of the Hispanic community. But Italian X, or Italian X, leans

79
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,660
heavily on the absurdity of Latin X, on the idea that a group that is undergoing an integration

80
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,460
process and that is becoming more white, that already uses a European language and has a lot

81
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,940
of white ancestry, for some reason needs to invent a new word that nobody actually likes

82
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:36,020
to describe itself in the name of DIE. Diversity, Inclusion, Equity. But fine, let's just keep the

83
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:42,260
trend up. How about French X? Brit X? Germixen? Actually, Germixen was unironically used in a

84
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,820
progressive discord in the name of preventing the inhabitants from being triggered at the site of

85
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:51,620
the word man. Can we use gay X to make being gay more inclusive? How about twinks? There we go.

86
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,460
Haha, can we use Sonic X to refer to furries? That was actually a pretty good show back in the day.

87
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,180
In 2009, when this channel was all about anime, we actually did a review of it if you want to go

88
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,460
see Babbysfo. Imagine being at the grocery store. You see a comic you read as a kid and the nostalgia

89
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,580
washes over you. Why not? You got a few bucks to spare. You pick it up and decide to check it out

90
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,420
when you're at home, wondering what your old hero idols are up to in the latest storylines. And as

91
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,580
you flip through the pages, you see Latinx propaganda. But actually, it's pretty realistic

92
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,740
propaganda because it features a white woman explaining to a Latina why she should be using

93
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,540
Latinx, how it's more inclusive. And this newly converted Latinx person sagely nods along with

94
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,540
this white-splaining, her brown body thoroughly colonized, her tiny Latin brain mind-fucked by

95
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,700
this person's white superiority. At the end of the comic, the new convert demands dignity for

96
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,600
all Latinx folk. The irony apparently lost on the creator of the comic of talking about dignity

97
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,200
while openly using Latinx. Also, where the fuck are the superheroes? These panels are from the

98
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,040
new Spider-Man book. That redhead is apparently Spider-Girl. Where's the fucking superheroes?

99
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,960
Even though nobody likes this garbage, especially the people who it's meant for, Latinx isn't going

100
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,200
away. Pop culture is pushing it like mad and it doesn't stop with Latinx. Filipinx was recently

101
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,240
used by a Riot Games developer to describe a new character in Valorant to a huge backlash across

102
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,920
the gaming space. Filipinx was received far worse than Latinx and the woman ended up apologizing for

103
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,080
it because Filipino people took it as a racial slur. Unlike Spanish, in Tagalog, Filipino applies

104
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,200
to both guys and girls, so it can't even rely on the one flimsy justification that Latinx has.

105
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,600
Let's bring things around full circle. At the beginning of the video, I quoted an article that

106
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,960
mentioned a Chicano slash Chicana identity. Chicano is an identifier used by people of

107
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,400
Mexican descent who were born in the United States. The Mexican-American identity appeared

108
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,000
as more Latinos began to assimilate into American culture, becoming analogous to black American and

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,120
all the others. The Chicano identity was formed as a reaction to most Latino people's desire to

110
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,480
assimilate and nowadays Chicano is used to refer to an anti-assimilationist Mexican element that

111
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,040
often aligns itself with the Black Panthers and other supremacist and separatist organizations.

112
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,160
The Chicanos and Chicanas created their own form of X, one by them, for them, and compatible with

113
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,720
their own language. There's no way I'm pronouncing this word correctly, so it's on screen. There are

114
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,400
some Mexicans who still speak native pre-colonization languages, and Mexican Spanish

115
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,000
has also inherited some traits from those native languages that mainline Spanish lacks. One of them

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,680
is determining gender by adjusting sound at the beginning of a word, and unlike Latinx,

117
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,160
it's actually pronounceable in Spanish if you place an X in that spot. This has the same effect

118
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,000
of putting the X at the end of the word in English. It degenders it, it adds that variable

119
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,120
quality to it, and it makes it more inclusive. As such, a lot of Chicano people began calling

120
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,800
themselves Xianos. In the 2010s, the Xianos and Chicano identities finally impacted with

121
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,400
modern social justice. And you know what happened to them? Yeah, Chicano got turned into Chicanx.

122
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,880
To wrap it back around, the father of Patrice Concolor's kid from both the start of this video

123
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,360
and featured in Yesterday's for being part of the Money Laundering, during that podcast that

124
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,800
no one's ever heard of? Yeah, he used Chicanx there too. My brother Daniel French was also

125
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,360
invited to this conversation, who's in a band called Las Capiteras. Phenomenal, phenomenal

126
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:10,040
Chicanx band. It sounds literally like chicken X. And even more hilariously, Xiano became XianX.

127
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,120
It's already got a fucking X in it, you numbskulls. XianX? How about we add another one in there,

128
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,360
just to make it more inclusive? XianX, why not? Maybe you guys are all taking fucking XianX if

129
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,200
you think any of this shit makes any sense. Xbox Live was full of racism, despite how many Xs it

130
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,120
had. Why don't we just make all the letters X? 6 Xs. X X X X X X. There you go. It's the most

131
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,560
inclusive possible thing, because nobody even knows what it says anymore. Does this mean that

132
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,440
white people can't act in porn anymore because it's triple X? Does this mean that all those

133
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,680
racist cartoons showing drunk black people with bottles of booze because they had X X X on the

134
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,640
bottle, it's not actually racism, it's just inclusivity? In fact, that actually seems to

135
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,200
be the case with most progressivism. Every attempt of progs to be inclusive always just ends up with

136
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,280
them being fucking racists. The entire thing seems arbitrary. I made a previous video about

137
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,880
the history of adding stars to words in order to censor them, because the words themselves were

138
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,200
offensive, like replacing the A in Nazi with a star symbol, and how that spread to hilarious

139
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,200
censorship efforts, like censoring actual people's names like Sargon or the Kordring or Sofia Narwits

140
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,640
or whoever else. If the same logic applied here, it would mean that Latino or Filipino or woman

141
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,360
were themselves offensive terms. But they're actually not. The removal of a letter and

142
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,400
replacing it with a meaningless symbol in this instance is for the sake of inclusivity rather

143
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,600
than censorship, even though it's the same thing functionally. Because in the end, progressives

144
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,080
view censorship and inclusivity as the same thing. If you think about it, this actually makes sense.

145
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,240
Being pro-free speech means risking being offensive and hearing offensive things. It means

146
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,040
being tolerant of offensive speech. The progressive drive towards inclusivity has always at its core

147
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,880
been anti-free speech. This is one of the other reasons that Hispanic people are rejecting Latinx,

148
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,280
aside from it just being plain old racist like we discussed earlier. And the left seems to be

149
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,480
determined to shoot themselves in the foot when it comes to Hispanic people. The Democrats are

150
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,720
already losing the growing Hispanic vote to the Republicans, as your average Hispanic voter is

151
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,520
family, church, and community-oriented, all values that Republicans appeal to more than Democrats.

152
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,680
Hispanic voters are also often tough on illegal immigration. They often view the police favorably,

153
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,400
and they're not that interested in race politics, all of which are positions that clash with the

154
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,120
progressive narrative. Latinx might be the final nail in the coffin regarding Hispanic support for

155
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,280
leftist politics, but it's certainly not the only one. It's all just so performative. Nobody wants

156
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,560
this. Nobody cares. It's just a way to make progs feel good about themselves, and for them to

157
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,360
virtue signal to other progs about how morally righteous they are. And the proper response that

158
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,840
we should take is the same as every other time something stupid like this happens. Laugh at them.

159
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,200
You can debate them if you want, but they're just going to scream about inclusivity,

160
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,280
so instead make fun of them. Let them know that they are a joke. Because they are.
