00:00.000 --> 00:08.960
When I was watching all of that Patrice Khan colors stuff for yesterday's video,

00:08.960 --> 00:11.640
I came across this clip during one of her interviews.

00:11.640 --> 00:18.200
Who's being impacted the most by COVID-19? The poor. Who's being impacted the most by COVID-19?

00:18.200 --> 00:20.280
Black folks, Latinx folks.

00:20.280 --> 00:24.280
Yeah, this is how I know she's fake. Only astroturfed politically correct talking

00:24.280 --> 00:30.960
heads actually use Latinx. Latinx as a term is a bastardization of Latina and Latino. Spanish,

00:30.960 --> 00:35.160
being a more gendered language than English, uses these two terms to refer to the male and

00:35.160 --> 00:40.320
female forms of Latin individual, adding X as an English neologism. In the English language,

00:40.320 --> 00:44.760
X is often used to refer to an unknown variable, a practice that got its start in mathematics.

00:44.760 --> 00:49.680
It later made the jump over to pop culture in the 80s and 90s to refer to something that is just

00:49.720 --> 00:54.680
not known. See Mega Man games happening in 2000X, for example. Yeah, it turned out that it doesn't

00:54.680 --> 00:58.400
matter what number you put in there. We didn't have robot shotas at all in the 2000s. Maybe

00:58.400 --> 01:03.120
Mega Man X will be more on the nose. They use 20XDX. The usage here is that it's some

01:03.120 --> 01:07.120
unknown time in the future. It's a deliberate vagueness of when the events take place. The

01:07.120 --> 01:11.400
purpose of it allows the author to buy themselves a bit more time and extend the realism of the

01:11.400 --> 01:16.480
story. Oh, it's 2022 and that future event didn't happen? Well, rather than writing 2022,

01:16.480 --> 01:22.920
if you write 20XDX, it can happen anytime between now and 2099, extending the plausibility of the

01:22.920 --> 01:27.320
story. This is ultimately the problem with Star Trek's canon. When the show debuted in the 60s,

01:27.320 --> 01:31.640
it made sense that the eugenics wars happened in the 1990s and the third world war happened

01:31.640 --> 01:35.920
in the 2040s. But nowadays, it seems kind of absurd. Though, if you listen to enough Tim

01:35.920 --> 01:39.760
Poole, it sounds like you might still get that third world war. Cross your fingers for a nuclear

01:39.760 --> 01:45.940
holocaust, Trekkies. But the use of X to refer to unknown data filtered down into LatinX. If you

01:45.940 --> 01:50.260
wanted to talk about a crowd of Latino and Latina people, the progressives would demand that you use

01:50.260 --> 01:56.100
LatinX as a simple shorthand since saying Latino and Latina was kind of clunky. After the rising

01:56.100 --> 02:01.380
popularity of trans activism in the early 2010s, and more recently, the direct co-opting of that

02:01.380 --> 02:07.420
movement by non-binary, genderqueer, and like, weird, dear gender people, the X in LatinX began

02:07.420 --> 02:12.540
to refer to people who did not view themselves as Latino or Latina. And so, LatinX began to be

02:12.540 --> 02:17.860
pushed not only for use to identify a mixed gender crowd, but to include other gender identities as

02:17.860 --> 02:22.900
well. Unfortunately, it turns out that the vast majority of LatinX people fucking hate the term.

02:22.900 --> 02:28.340
Poole finds LatinX people don't like to be called LatinX. Despite this monumental effort to be

02:28.340 --> 02:33.580
inclusive, it may fall on deaf ears, at least with LatinX voters. A recent survey conducted by market

02:33.580 --> 02:39.220
research agency Think Now found that nearly half, 44%, of LatinX people polled prefer the term

02:39.220 --> 02:43.940
Hispanic, which somebody, maybe Elizabeth Warren, should probably tell them is extremely problematic

02:43.940 --> 02:49.860
due to its imperialist origins. 24% of respondents preferred Latino or Latina, also problematic.

02:49.860 --> 02:55.020
11% preferred the name of their country of origin, 7% preferred their country of origin plus American,

02:55.020 --> 03:01.300
6% preferred just American, 5% preferred Chicano and Chicana, and just 2% of respondents preferred

03:01.300 --> 03:05.700
the term LatinX. This is always the case, isn't it? Progressives at the top claim to speak for a

03:05.700 --> 03:09.980
whole class of people while that class actually rejects them. Socialists for the working class,

03:09.980 --> 03:15.260
BLM for black people, and now this. This was steady across all demographics. We went into it

03:15.260 --> 03:18.940
with the hypothesis that awareness was always going to be lower than social media makes it

03:18.940 --> 03:24.380
seem, said Mario Xavier Carraso, the co-founder of Think Now. We didn't think it was going to be as

03:24.380 --> 03:28.020
low as it is. We also thought that it was going to be significantly more popular among young people

03:28.020 --> 03:32.380
and it's not. There's no significant difference there. In fact, the researchers found that just

03:32.380 --> 03:38.460
3% of the respondents under 35 preferred LatinX and 97% preferred anything else. Clearly the

03:38.460 --> 03:42.140
progressive media establishment and the Democratic candidates for president have a lot more educating

03:42.140 --> 03:47.180
to do. Um, is this a parody article? I can't tell. To me, it kind of sounds like it, but I wouldn't

03:47.180 --> 03:52.020
actually put it past a prog writer to unironically say something like, we need to educate the dirty

03:52.020 --> 03:57.300
unwashed LatinX underclass to accept our proper progressive inclusive framing. Carraso says

03:57.300 --> 04:01.420
they're going to follow up the survey with another one asking if LatinX people are actually offended

04:01.420 --> 04:05.980
by this term or if they're just unaware of it. But for some, including Giancarlo Sopo,

04:05.980 --> 04:11.100
a contributor to USA Today, the answer is obvious. It's offensive. Gender non-conforming Americans

04:11.100 --> 04:14.860
should be treated with compassion and respect, he wrote. If someone wants to be called LatinX,

04:14.860 --> 04:19.300
that's fine, but the label should not be forced upon all Latinos. Hispanic Americans face plenty

04:19.300 --> 04:22.980
of challenges. The last thing we need are progressives woke-splaining how to speak

04:22.980 --> 04:27.260
Spanish. And this is the core of the problem. Most people view this as an English colonization

04:27.260 --> 04:32.340
of the Spanish language. It's an English practice to put X to refer to an unknown variable. Neopronouns

04:32.340 --> 04:37.780
are an English phenomenon. LatinX is unpronounceable in Spanish because X is used differently. That's

04:37.780 --> 04:43.660
why they say Mexico and not Mexico. X conjugates with a previous vowel to make a new sound. Conjugates?

04:43.660 --> 04:47.700
That's with verbs. I don't know. Do you know what I mean? When a vowel's sound changes because of

04:47.700 --> 04:51.300
other continents and vowels around, you know what I'm talking about. The point is, unlike Mexico,

04:51.300 --> 04:56.180
there's no previous vowel in LatinX. The letter is an N, so it just doesn't work. Hispanics don't

04:56.300 --> 05:00.820
view LatinX as inclusive. They view it as colonialism. Hell, not even English people

05:00.820 --> 05:05.540
like it. During the RadFem days, 10 to 15 years ago, there was a push to use a Womxn as well as

05:05.540 --> 05:10.140
Womyn, you know, women with a Y, to distinguish woman from man. The idea being that woman is a

05:10.140 --> 05:15.340
root of the word man in English, but women should be their own strong, beautiful, powerful class,

05:15.340 --> 05:20.620
not defined in relation to men, but fierce on their own right. But nowadays, Womxn is used to

05:20.620 --> 05:25.580
include trans women in the name of inclusivity. And most trans women fucking hate it. Nobody wants

05:25.580 --> 05:30.260
this progressive bullshit. But if you object, of course, you're transphobic, right? The joke

05:30.260 --> 05:35.420
has become so widespread that we're now seeing Italian X in response to it. There's been a

05:35.420 --> 05:39.940
pretty prolific meme that Italians aren't actually white people, generally referring to how Italians

05:39.940 --> 05:43.660
and the Irish as well were treated in the United States shortly after a large migration of their

05:43.660 --> 05:47.660
population there, as well as the idea that there was a gradual intermixing between the Southern

05:47.660 --> 05:52.340
Europeans and the African and Arab populations due to the history of the Mediterranean Sea. As

05:52.420 --> 05:56.500
a very generalized statement, Southern Europeans have more Mediterranean physical features than

05:56.500 --> 06:00.660
what was considered white at the time, which was the Northern and Central European standard you

06:00.660 --> 06:05.020
could find in Britain, France, Germany, and the Nordic countries. In the United States, however,

06:05.020 --> 06:10.780
Irish and Italians gradually integrated and became accepted as white. And frankly, the same process

06:10.780 --> 06:15.980
is happening now to a lot of the Hispanic community. But Italian X, or Italian X, leans

06:15.980 --> 06:20.660
heavily on the absurdity of Latin X, on the idea that a group that is undergoing an integration

06:20.660 --> 06:25.460
process and that is becoming more white, that already uses a European language and has a lot

06:25.460 --> 06:29.940
of white ancestry, for some reason needs to invent a new word that nobody actually likes

06:29.940 --> 06:36.020
to describe itself in the name of DIE. Diversity, Inclusion, Equity. But fine, let's just keep the

06:36.020 --> 06:42.260
trend up. How about French X? Brit X? Germixen? Actually, Germixen was unironically used in a

06:42.260 --> 06:45.820
progressive discord in the name of preventing the inhabitants from being triggered at the site of

06:45.820 --> 06:51.620
the word man. Can we use gay X to make being gay more inclusive? How about twinks? There we go.

06:51.620 --> 06:56.460
Haha, can we use Sonic X to refer to furries? That was actually a pretty good show back in the day.

06:56.460 --> 07:00.180
In 2009, when this channel was all about anime, we actually did a review of it if you want to go

07:00.180 --> 07:05.460
see Babbysfo. Imagine being at the grocery store. You see a comic you read as a kid and the nostalgia

07:05.460 --> 07:09.580
washes over you. Why not? You got a few bucks to spare. You pick it up and decide to check it out

07:09.580 --> 07:13.420
when you're at home, wondering what your old hero idols are up to in the latest storylines. And as

07:13.460 --> 07:17.580
you flip through the pages, you see Latinx propaganda. But actually, it's pretty realistic

07:17.580 --> 07:21.740
propaganda because it features a white woman explaining to a Latina why she should be using

07:21.740 --> 07:26.540
Latinx, how it's more inclusive. And this newly converted Latinx person sagely nods along with

07:26.540 --> 07:31.540
this white-splaining, her brown body thoroughly colonized, her tiny Latin brain mind-fucked by

07:31.540 --> 07:35.700
this person's white superiority. At the end of the comic, the new convert demands dignity for

07:35.700 --> 07:40.600
all Latinx folk. The irony apparently lost on the creator of the comic of talking about dignity

07:40.600 --> 07:45.200
while openly using Latinx. Also, where the fuck are the superheroes? These panels are from the

07:45.200 --> 07:49.040
new Spider-Man book. That redhead is apparently Spider-Girl. Where's the fucking superheroes?

07:49.040 --> 07:53.960
Even though nobody likes this garbage, especially the people who it's meant for, Latinx isn't going

07:53.960 --> 07:59.200
away. Pop culture is pushing it like mad and it doesn't stop with Latinx. Filipinx was recently

07:59.200 --> 08:04.240
used by a Riot Games developer to describe a new character in Valorant to a huge backlash across

08:04.240 --> 08:09.920
the gaming space. Filipinx was received far worse than Latinx and the woman ended up apologizing for

08:09.920 --> 08:15.080
it because Filipino people took it as a racial slur. Unlike Spanish, in Tagalog, Filipino applies

08:15.080 --> 08:20.200
to both guys and girls, so it can't even rely on the one flimsy justification that Latinx has.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.600
Let's bring things around full circle. At the beginning of the video, I quoted an article that

08:24.600 --> 08:28.960
mentioned a Chicano slash Chicana identity. Chicano is an identifier used by people of

08:28.960 --> 08:33.400
Mexican descent who were born in the United States. The Mexican-American identity appeared

08:33.400 --> 08:38.000
as more Latinos began to assimilate into American culture, becoming analogous to black American and

08:39.000 --> 08:44.120
all the others. The Chicano identity was formed as a reaction to most Latino people's desire to

08:44.120 --> 08:49.480
assimilate and nowadays Chicano is used to refer to an anti-assimilationist Mexican element that

08:49.480 --> 08:54.040
often aligns itself with the Black Panthers and other supremacist and separatist organizations.

08:54.040 --> 09:00.160
The Chicanos and Chicanas created their own form of X, one by them, for them, and compatible with

09:00.160 --> 09:04.720
their own language. There's no way I'm pronouncing this word correctly, so it's on screen. There are

09:04.720 --> 09:10.400
some Mexicans who still speak native pre-colonization languages, and Mexican Spanish

09:10.400 --> 09:16.000
has also inherited some traits from those native languages that mainline Spanish lacks. One of them

09:16.000 --> 09:20.680
is determining gender by adjusting sound at the beginning of a word, and unlike Latinx,

09:20.680 --> 09:26.160
it's actually pronounceable in Spanish if you place an X in that spot. This has the same effect

09:26.160 --> 09:31.000
of putting the X at the end of the word in English. It degenders it, it adds that variable

09:31.000 --> 09:35.120
quality to it, and it makes it more inclusive. As such, a lot of Chicano people began calling

09:35.120 --> 09:40.800
themselves Xianos. In the 2010s, the Xianos and Chicano identities finally impacted with

09:40.800 --> 09:45.400
modern social justice. And you know what happened to them? Yeah, Chicano got turned into Chicanx.

09:45.400 --> 09:49.880
To wrap it back around, the father of Patrice Concolor's kid from both the start of this video

09:49.880 --> 09:53.360
and featured in Yesterday's for being part of the Money Laundering, during that podcast that

09:53.360 --> 09:56.800
no one's ever heard of? Yeah, he used Chicanx there too. My brother Daniel French was also

09:56.800 --> 10:01.360
invited to this conversation, who's in a band called Las Capiteras. Phenomenal, phenomenal

10:01.360 --> 10:10.040
Chicanx band. It sounds literally like chicken X. And even more hilariously, Xiano became XianX.

10:10.040 --> 10:15.120
It's already got a fucking X in it, you numbskulls. XianX? How about we add another one in there,

10:15.120 --> 10:19.360
just to make it more inclusive? XianX, why not? Maybe you guys are all taking fucking XianX if

10:19.360 --> 10:23.200
you think any of this shit makes any sense. Xbox Live was full of racism, despite how many Xs it

10:23.200 --> 10:28.120
had. Why don't we just make all the letters X? 6 Xs. X X X X X X. There you go. It's the most

10:28.120 --> 10:31.560
inclusive possible thing, because nobody even knows what it says anymore. Does this mean that

10:31.560 --> 10:35.440
white people can't act in porn anymore because it's triple X? Does this mean that all those

10:35.440 --> 10:40.680
racist cartoons showing drunk black people with bottles of booze because they had X X X on the

10:40.680 --> 10:44.640
bottle, it's not actually racism, it's just inclusivity? In fact, that actually seems to

10:44.640 --> 10:50.200
be the case with most progressivism. Every attempt of progs to be inclusive always just ends up with

10:50.200 --> 10:55.280
them being fucking racists. The entire thing seems arbitrary. I made a previous video about

10:55.280 --> 10:59.880
the history of adding stars to words in order to censor them, because the words themselves were

10:59.880 --> 11:05.200
offensive, like replacing the A in Nazi with a star symbol, and how that spread to hilarious

11:05.200 --> 11:10.200
censorship efforts, like censoring actual people's names like Sargon or the Kordring or Sofia Narwits

11:10.200 --> 11:15.640
or whoever else. If the same logic applied here, it would mean that Latino or Filipino or woman

11:15.640 --> 11:20.360
were themselves offensive terms. But they're actually not. The removal of a letter and

11:20.360 --> 11:24.400
replacing it with a meaningless symbol in this instance is for the sake of inclusivity rather

11:24.400 --> 11:28.600
than censorship, even though it's the same thing functionally. Because in the end, progressives

11:28.600 --> 11:33.080
view censorship and inclusivity as the same thing. If you think about it, this actually makes sense.

11:33.080 --> 11:39.240
Being pro-free speech means risking being offensive and hearing offensive things. It means

11:39.240 --> 11:45.040
being tolerant of offensive speech. The progressive drive towards inclusivity has always at its core

11:45.160 --> 11:50.880
been anti-free speech. This is one of the other reasons that Hispanic people are rejecting Latinx,

11:50.880 --> 11:55.280
aside from it just being plain old racist like we discussed earlier. And the left seems to be

11:55.280 --> 11:59.480
determined to shoot themselves in the foot when it comes to Hispanic people. The Democrats are

11:59.480 --> 12:03.720
already losing the growing Hispanic vote to the Republicans, as your average Hispanic voter is

12:03.720 --> 12:08.520
family, church, and community-oriented, all values that Republicans appeal to more than Democrats.

12:08.520 --> 12:13.680
Hispanic voters are also often tough on illegal immigration. They often view the police favorably,

12:13.800 --> 12:18.400
and they're not that interested in race politics, all of which are positions that clash with the

12:18.400 --> 12:23.120
progressive narrative. Latinx might be the final nail in the coffin regarding Hispanic support for

12:23.120 --> 12:29.280
leftist politics, but it's certainly not the only one. It's all just so performative. Nobody wants

12:29.280 --> 12:33.560
this. Nobody cares. It's just a way to make progs feel good about themselves, and for them to

12:33.560 --> 12:37.360
virtue signal to other progs about how morally righteous they are. And the proper response that

12:37.360 --> 12:41.840
we should take is the same as every other time something stupid like this happens. Laugh at them.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.200
You can debate them if you want, but they're just going to scream about inclusivity,

12:45.200 --> 12:49.280
so instead make fun of them. Let them know that they are a joke. Because they are.
