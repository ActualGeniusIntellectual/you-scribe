0	8960	When I was watching all of that Patrice Khan colors stuff for yesterday's video,
8960	11640	I came across this clip during one of her interviews.
11640	18200	Who's being impacted the most by COVID-19? The poor. Who's being impacted the most by COVID-19?
18200	20280	Black folks, Latinx folks.
20280	24280	Yeah, this is how I know she's fake. Only astroturfed politically correct talking
24280	30960	heads actually use Latinx. Latinx as a term is a bastardization of Latina and Latino. Spanish,
30960	35160	being a more gendered language than English, uses these two terms to refer to the male and
35160	40320	female forms of Latin individual, adding X as an English neologism. In the English language,
40320	44760	X is often used to refer to an unknown variable, a practice that got its start in mathematics.
44760	49680	It later made the jump over to pop culture in the 80s and 90s to refer to something that is just
49720	54680	not known. See Mega Man games happening in 2000X, for example. Yeah, it turned out that it doesn't
54680	58400	matter what number you put in there. We didn't have robot shotas at all in the 2000s. Maybe
58400	63120	Mega Man X will be more on the nose. They use 20XDX. The usage here is that it's some
63120	67120	unknown time in the future. It's a deliberate vagueness of when the events take place. The
67120	71400	purpose of it allows the author to buy themselves a bit more time and extend the realism of the
71400	76480	story. Oh, it's 2022 and that future event didn't happen? Well, rather than writing 2022,
76480	82920	if you write 20XDX, it can happen anytime between now and 2099, extending the plausibility of the
82920	87320	story. This is ultimately the problem with Star Trek's canon. When the show debuted in the 60s,
87320	91640	it made sense that the eugenics wars happened in the 1990s and the third world war happened
91640	95920	in the 2040s. But nowadays, it seems kind of absurd. Though, if you listen to enough Tim
95920	99760	Poole, it sounds like you might still get that third world war. Cross your fingers for a nuclear
99760	105940	holocaust, Trekkies. But the use of X to refer to unknown data filtered down into LatinX. If you
105940	110260	wanted to talk about a crowd of Latino and Latina people, the progressives would demand that you use
110260	116100	LatinX as a simple shorthand since saying Latino and Latina was kind of clunky. After the rising
116100	121380	popularity of trans activism in the early 2010s, and more recently, the direct co-opting of that
121380	127420	movement by non-binary, genderqueer, and like, weird, dear gender people, the X in LatinX began
127420	132540	to refer to people who did not view themselves as Latino or Latina. And so, LatinX began to be
132540	137860	pushed not only for use to identify a mixed gender crowd, but to include other gender identities as
137860	142900	well. Unfortunately, it turns out that the vast majority of LatinX people fucking hate the term.
142900	148340	Poole finds LatinX people don't like to be called LatinX. Despite this monumental effort to be
148340	153580	inclusive, it may fall on deaf ears, at least with LatinX voters. A recent survey conducted by market
153580	159220	research agency Think Now found that nearly half, 44%, of LatinX people polled prefer the term
159220	163940	Hispanic, which somebody, maybe Elizabeth Warren, should probably tell them is extremely problematic
163940	169860	due to its imperialist origins. 24% of respondents preferred Latino or Latina, also problematic.
169860	175020	11% preferred the name of their country of origin, 7% preferred their country of origin plus American,
175020	181300	6% preferred just American, 5% preferred Chicano and Chicana, and just 2% of respondents preferred
181300	185700	the term LatinX. This is always the case, isn't it? Progressives at the top claim to speak for a
185700	189980	whole class of people while that class actually rejects them. Socialists for the working class,
189980	195260	BLM for black people, and now this. This was steady across all demographics. We went into it
195260	198940	with the hypothesis that awareness was always going to be lower than social media makes it
198940	204380	seem, said Mario Xavier Carraso, the co-founder of Think Now. We didn't think it was going to be as
204380	208020	low as it is. We also thought that it was going to be significantly more popular among young people
208020	212380	and it's not. There's no significant difference there. In fact, the researchers found that just
212380	218460	3% of the respondents under 35 preferred LatinX and 97% preferred anything else. Clearly the
218460	222140	progressive media establishment and the Democratic candidates for president have a lot more educating
222140	227180	to do. Um, is this a parody article? I can't tell. To me, it kind of sounds like it, but I wouldn't
227180	232020	actually put it past a prog writer to unironically say something like, we need to educate the dirty
232020	237300	unwashed LatinX underclass to accept our proper progressive inclusive framing. Carraso says
237300	241420	they're going to follow up the survey with another one asking if LatinX people are actually offended
241420	245980	by this term or if they're just unaware of it. But for some, including Giancarlo Sopo,
245980	251100	a contributor to USA Today, the answer is obvious. It's offensive. Gender non-conforming Americans
251100	254860	should be treated with compassion and respect, he wrote. If someone wants to be called LatinX,
254860	259300	that's fine, but the label should not be forced upon all Latinos. Hispanic Americans face plenty
259300	262980	of challenges. The last thing we need are progressives woke-splaining how to speak
262980	267260	Spanish. And this is the core of the problem. Most people view this as an English colonization
267260	272340	of the Spanish language. It's an English practice to put X to refer to an unknown variable. Neopronouns
272340	277780	are an English phenomenon. LatinX is unpronounceable in Spanish because X is used differently. That's
277780	283660	why they say Mexico and not Mexico. X conjugates with a previous vowel to make a new sound. Conjugates?
283660	287700	That's with verbs. I don't know. Do you know what I mean? When a vowel's sound changes because of
287700	291300	other continents and vowels around, you know what I'm talking about. The point is, unlike Mexico,
291300	296180	there's no previous vowel in LatinX. The letter is an N, so it just doesn't work. Hispanics don't
296300	300820	view LatinX as inclusive. They view it as colonialism. Hell, not even English people
300820	305540	like it. During the RadFem days, 10 to 15 years ago, there was a push to use a Womxn as well as
305540	310140	Womyn, you know, women with a Y, to distinguish woman from man. The idea being that woman is a
310140	315340	root of the word man in English, but women should be their own strong, beautiful, powerful class,
315340	320620	not defined in relation to men, but fierce on their own right. But nowadays, Womxn is used to
320620	325580	include trans women in the name of inclusivity. And most trans women fucking hate it. Nobody wants
325580	330260	this progressive bullshit. But if you object, of course, you're transphobic, right? The joke
330260	335420	has become so widespread that we're now seeing Italian X in response to it. There's been a
335420	339940	pretty prolific meme that Italians aren't actually white people, generally referring to how Italians
339940	343660	and the Irish as well were treated in the United States shortly after a large migration of their
343660	347660	population there, as well as the idea that there was a gradual intermixing between the Southern
347660	352340	Europeans and the African and Arab populations due to the history of the Mediterranean Sea. As
352420	356500	a very generalized statement, Southern Europeans have more Mediterranean physical features than
356500	360660	what was considered white at the time, which was the Northern and Central European standard you
360660	365020	could find in Britain, France, Germany, and the Nordic countries. In the United States, however,
365020	370780	Irish and Italians gradually integrated and became accepted as white. And frankly, the same process
370780	375980	is happening now to a lot of the Hispanic community. But Italian X, or Italian X, leans
375980	380660	heavily on the absurdity of Latin X, on the idea that a group that is undergoing an integration
380660	385460	process and that is becoming more white, that already uses a European language and has a lot
385460	389940	of white ancestry, for some reason needs to invent a new word that nobody actually likes
389940	396020	to describe itself in the name of DIE. Diversity, Inclusion, Equity. But fine, let's just keep the
396020	402260	trend up. How about French X? Brit X? Germixen? Actually, Germixen was unironically used in a
402260	405820	progressive discord in the name of preventing the inhabitants from being triggered at the site of
405820	411620	the word man. Can we use gay X to make being gay more inclusive? How about twinks? There we go.
411620	416460	Haha, can we use Sonic X to refer to furries? That was actually a pretty good show back in the day.
416460	420180	In 2009, when this channel was all about anime, we actually did a review of it if you want to go
420180	425460	see Babbysfo. Imagine being at the grocery store. You see a comic you read as a kid and the nostalgia
425460	429580	washes over you. Why not? You got a few bucks to spare. You pick it up and decide to check it out
429580	433420	when you're at home, wondering what your old hero idols are up to in the latest storylines. And as
433460	437580	you flip through the pages, you see Latinx propaganda. But actually, it's pretty realistic
437580	441740	propaganda because it features a white woman explaining to a Latina why she should be using
441740	446540	Latinx, how it's more inclusive. And this newly converted Latinx person sagely nods along with
446540	451540	this white-splaining, her brown body thoroughly colonized, her tiny Latin brain mind-fucked by
451540	455700	this person's white superiority. At the end of the comic, the new convert demands dignity for
455700	460600	all Latinx folk. The irony apparently lost on the creator of the comic of talking about dignity
460600	465200	while openly using Latinx. Also, where the fuck are the superheroes? These panels are from the
465200	469040	new Spider-Man book. That redhead is apparently Spider-Girl. Where's the fucking superheroes?
469040	473960	Even though nobody likes this garbage, especially the people who it's meant for, Latinx isn't going
473960	479200	away. Pop culture is pushing it like mad and it doesn't stop with Latinx. Filipinx was recently
479200	484240	used by a Riot Games developer to describe a new character in Valorant to a huge backlash across
484240	489920	the gaming space. Filipinx was received far worse than Latinx and the woman ended up apologizing for
489920	495080	it because Filipino people took it as a racial slur. Unlike Spanish, in Tagalog, Filipino applies
495080	500200	to both guys and girls, so it can't even rely on the one flimsy justification that Latinx has.
500200	504600	Let's bring things around full circle. At the beginning of the video, I quoted an article that
504600	508960	mentioned a Chicano slash Chicana identity. Chicano is an identifier used by people of
508960	513400	Mexican descent who were born in the United States. The Mexican-American identity appeared
513400	518000	as more Latinos began to assimilate into American culture, becoming analogous to black American and
519000	524120	all the others. The Chicano identity was formed as a reaction to most Latino people's desire to
524120	529480	assimilate and nowadays Chicano is used to refer to an anti-assimilationist Mexican element that
529480	534040	often aligns itself with the Black Panthers and other supremacist and separatist organizations.
534040	540160	The Chicanos and Chicanas created their own form of X, one by them, for them, and compatible with
540160	544720	their own language. There's no way I'm pronouncing this word correctly, so it's on screen. There are
544720	550400	some Mexicans who still speak native pre-colonization languages, and Mexican Spanish
550400	556000	has also inherited some traits from those native languages that mainline Spanish lacks. One of them
556000	560680	is determining gender by adjusting sound at the beginning of a word, and unlike Latinx,
560680	566160	it's actually pronounceable in Spanish if you place an X in that spot. This has the same effect
566160	571000	of putting the X at the end of the word in English. It degenders it, it adds that variable
571000	575120	quality to it, and it makes it more inclusive. As such, a lot of Chicano people began calling
575120	580800	themselves Xianos. In the 2010s, the Xianos and Chicano identities finally impacted with
580800	585400	modern social justice. And you know what happened to them? Yeah, Chicano got turned into Chicanx.
585400	589880	To wrap it back around, the father of Patrice Concolor's kid from both the start of this video
589880	593360	and featured in Yesterday's for being part of the Money Laundering, during that podcast that
593360	596800	no one's ever heard of? Yeah, he used Chicanx there too. My brother Daniel French was also
596800	601360	invited to this conversation, who's in a band called Las Capiteras. Phenomenal, phenomenal
601360	610040	Chicanx band. It sounds literally like chicken X. And even more hilariously, Xiano became XianX.
610040	615120	It's already got a fucking X in it, you numbskulls. XianX? How about we add another one in there,
615120	619360	just to make it more inclusive? XianX, why not? Maybe you guys are all taking fucking XianX if
619360	623200	you think any of this shit makes any sense. Xbox Live was full of racism, despite how many Xs it
623200	628120	had. Why don't we just make all the letters X? 6 Xs. X X X X X X. There you go. It's the most
628120	631560	inclusive possible thing, because nobody even knows what it says anymore. Does this mean that
631560	635440	white people can't act in porn anymore because it's triple X? Does this mean that all those
635440	640680	racist cartoons showing drunk black people with bottles of booze because they had X X X on the
640680	644640	bottle, it's not actually racism, it's just inclusivity? In fact, that actually seems to
644640	650200	be the case with most progressivism. Every attempt of progs to be inclusive always just ends up with
650200	655280	them being fucking racists. The entire thing seems arbitrary. I made a previous video about
655280	659880	the history of adding stars to words in order to censor them, because the words themselves were
659880	665200	offensive, like replacing the A in Nazi with a star symbol, and how that spread to hilarious
665200	670200	censorship efforts, like censoring actual people's names like Sargon or the Kordring or Sofia Narwits
670200	675640	or whoever else. If the same logic applied here, it would mean that Latino or Filipino or woman
675640	680360	were themselves offensive terms. But they're actually not. The removal of a letter and
680360	684400	replacing it with a meaningless symbol in this instance is for the sake of inclusivity rather
684400	688600	than censorship, even though it's the same thing functionally. Because in the end, progressives
688600	693080	view censorship and inclusivity as the same thing. If you think about it, this actually makes sense.
693080	699240	Being pro-free speech means risking being offensive and hearing offensive things. It means
699240	705040	being tolerant of offensive speech. The progressive drive towards inclusivity has always at its core
705160	710880	been anti-free speech. This is one of the other reasons that Hispanic people are rejecting Latinx,
710880	715280	aside from it just being plain old racist like we discussed earlier. And the left seems to be
715280	719480	determined to shoot themselves in the foot when it comes to Hispanic people. The Democrats are
719480	723720	already losing the growing Hispanic vote to the Republicans, as your average Hispanic voter is
723720	728520	family, church, and community-oriented, all values that Republicans appeal to more than Democrats.
728520	733680	Hispanic voters are also often tough on illegal immigration. They often view the police favorably,
733800	738400	and they're not that interested in race politics, all of which are positions that clash with the
738400	743120	progressive narrative. Latinx might be the final nail in the coffin regarding Hispanic support for
743120	749280	leftist politics, but it's certainly not the only one. It's all just so performative. Nobody wants
749280	753560	this. Nobody cares. It's just a way to make progs feel good about themselves, and for them to
753560	757360	virtue signal to other progs about how morally righteous they are. And the proper response that
757360	761840	we should take is the same as every other time something stupid like this happens. Laugh at them.
761920	765200	You can debate them if you want, but they're just going to scream about inclusivity,
765200	769280	so instead make fun of them. Let them know that they are a joke. Because they are.
