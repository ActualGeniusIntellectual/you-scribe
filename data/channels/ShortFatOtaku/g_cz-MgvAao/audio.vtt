Hey guys, Dev here, and if you're watching this over on the main Short Fight Otaku channel,

00:05.200 --> 00:06.200
it's been a while.

00:06.200 --> 00:09.480
The first question you've probably got is, where the hell did you guys go?

00:09.480 --> 00:15.400
We realized that not all of you actually want to see our daily uploads of Let's Play content,

00:15.400 --> 00:22.720
so we moved all of that stuff over to a different channel at youtube.com slash c slash no-talent-gaming.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.640
So for the past five months, we've been over there uploading stuff every single day.

00:26.640 --> 00:31.720
I've also been on Twitch at twitch.tv slash shortfightotaku doing streams.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.160
I'm making this vlog to announce two big things.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.400
One, I'm doing a daily stream challenge for the month of June.

00:37.400 --> 00:43.000
That's right, every single day this month I plan to stream at twitch.tv slash shortfightotaku.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.520
So if you just want a new daily dose of Dev, you can head on over there every single night.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.440
Even if you're not interested in gaming content so much, I'd still request you come over because

00:51.440 --> 00:56.920
I often talk about, you know, gamergate stuff and SJW stuff and, you know, political news

00:56.920 --> 00:57.920
of the day.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.120
I do like to cover all the topics whenever I play a game.

01:00.120 --> 01:05.440
The second big thing is that we're finally restarting this channel, the main shortfightotaku

01:05.440 --> 01:06.440
channel.

01:06.440 --> 01:10.520
I know most of the subscribers to this channel are interested in SJW stuff, and that is something

01:10.520 --> 01:12.240
that we do plan to deliver.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.200
Long story short, it's just been a really hectic semester at school.

01:15.200 --> 01:19.300
Dave wasn't able to do much, I wasn't able to do much, and camera lady actually now has

01:19.300 --> 01:21.700
a new job, so she's not doing much either.

01:21.700 --> 01:26.300
But school's over, summer's underway, and we do have a lot more time on our hands.

01:26.300 --> 01:30.780
And not to get into too much detail about it, we have four big projects we like to get

01:30.780 --> 01:33.120
underway on YouTube.

01:33.120 --> 01:38.780
There will be future vlogs in the coming weeks, probably next Monday I'd say, talking about

01:38.780 --> 01:41.100
these projects in depth and what we plan to do.

01:41.100 --> 01:44.940
But long story short, in about two and a half weeks time, you're gonna start seeing new

01:44.940 --> 01:50.220
content on this channel, and it's mainly going to be political and SJW stuff in nature.

01:50.220 --> 01:55.040
As for gaming and anime content, we will be talking about that in future vlogs as well.

01:55.040 --> 01:59.380
We have some very big plans, we've had these plans for about five or six months now, we

01:59.380 --> 02:02.080
just haven't been able to do them, and now we can.

02:02.080 --> 02:06.100
So thank you guys for sticking around, I have noticed that the sub count has basically remained

02:06.100 --> 02:11.340
static, which is pretty good for a channel that puts out no content for about five months,

02:11.340 --> 02:12.340
so thank you.

02:12.340 --> 02:17.540
I know what you're here for, we will be making it, and if you're interested, please check

02:17.540 --> 02:22.640
out youtube.com slash c slash no talent gaming for our let's plays.

02:22.640 --> 02:27.560
And if you want to join in on the daily stream challenge this month, head on over to twitch.tv

02:27.560 --> 02:30.700
slash short fight out talk, sometime tonight I'll be playing another game.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.380
See you there guys, I love you.
