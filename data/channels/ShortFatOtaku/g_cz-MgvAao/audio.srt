00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hey guys, Dev here, and if you're watching this over on the main Short Fight Otaku channel,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,200
it's been a while.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,480
The first question you've probably got is, where the hell did you guys go?

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,400
We realized that not all of you actually want to see our daily uploads of Let's Play content,

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:22,720
so we moved all of that stuff over to a different channel at youtube.com slash c slash no-talent-gaming.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,640
So for the past five months, we've been over there uploading stuff every single day.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,720
I've also been on Twitch at twitch.tv slash shortfightotaku doing streams.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,160
I'm making this vlog to announce two big things.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,400
One, I'm doing a daily stream challenge for the month of June.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,000
That's right, every single day this month I plan to stream at twitch.tv slash shortfightotaku.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,520
So if you just want a new daily dose of Dev, you can head on over there every single night.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,440
Even if you're not interested in gaming content so much, I'd still request you come over because

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,920
I often talk about, you know, gamergate stuff and SJW stuff and, you know, political news

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
of the day.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,120
I do like to cover all the topics whenever I play a game.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,440
The second big thing is that we're finally restarting this channel, the main shortfightotaku

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
channel.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,520
I know most of the subscribers to this channel are interested in SJW stuff, and that is something

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,240
that we do plan to deliver.

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,200
Long story short, it's just been a really hectic semester at school.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,300
Dave wasn't able to do much, I wasn't able to do much, and camera lady actually now has

22
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,700
a new job, so she's not doing much either.

23
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,300
But school's over, summer's underway, and we do have a lot more time on our hands.

24
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,780
And not to get into too much detail about it, we have four big projects we like to get

25
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,120
underway on YouTube.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,780
There will be future vlogs in the coming weeks, probably next Monday I'd say, talking about

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,100
these projects in depth and what we plan to do.

28
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,940
But long story short, in about two and a half weeks time, you're gonna start seeing new

29
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:50,220
content on this channel, and it's mainly going to be political and SJW stuff in nature.

30
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,040
As for gaming and anime content, we will be talking about that in future vlogs as well.

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,380
We have some very big plans, we've had these plans for about five or six months now, we

32
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,080
just haven't been able to do them, and now we can.

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,100
So thank you guys for sticking around, I have noticed that the sub count has basically remained

34
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,340
static, which is pretty good for a channel that puts out no content for about five months,

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,340
so thank you.

36
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,540
I know what you're here for, we will be making it, and if you're interested, please check

37
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,640
out youtube.com slash c slash no talent gaming for our let's plays.

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,560
And if you want to join in on the daily stream challenge this month, head on over to twitch.tv

39
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,700
slash short fight out talk, sometime tonight I'll be playing another game.

40
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,380
See you there guys, I love you.
