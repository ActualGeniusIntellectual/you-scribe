0	5200	Hey guys, Dev here, and if you're watching this over on the main Short Fight Otaku channel,
5200	6200	it's been a while.
6200	9480	The first question you've probably got is, where the hell did you guys go?
9480	15400	We realized that not all of you actually want to see our daily uploads of Let's Play content,
15400	22720	so we moved all of that stuff over to a different channel at youtube.com slash c slash no-talent-gaming.
22720	26640	So for the past five months, we've been over there uploading stuff every single day.
26640	31720	I've also been on Twitch at twitch.tv slash shortfightotaku doing streams.
31720	34160	I'm making this vlog to announce two big things.
34160	37400	One, I'm doing a daily stream challenge for the month of June.
37400	43000	That's right, every single day this month I plan to stream at twitch.tv slash shortfightotaku.
43000	47520	So if you just want a new daily dose of Dev, you can head on over there every single night.
47520	51440	Even if you're not interested in gaming content so much, I'd still request you come over because
51440	56920	I often talk about, you know, gamergate stuff and SJW stuff and, you know, political news
56920	57920	of the day.
57920	60120	I do like to cover all the topics whenever I play a game.
60120	65440	The second big thing is that we're finally restarting this channel, the main shortfightotaku
65440	66440	channel.
66440	70520	I know most of the subscribers to this channel are interested in SJW stuff, and that is something
70520	72240	that we do plan to deliver.
72240	75200	Long story short, it's just been a really hectic semester at school.
75200	79300	Dave wasn't able to do much, I wasn't able to do much, and camera lady actually now has
79300	81700	a new job, so she's not doing much either.
81700	86300	But school's over, summer's underway, and we do have a lot more time on our hands.
86300	90780	And not to get into too much detail about it, we have four big projects we like to get
90780	93120	underway on YouTube.
93120	98780	There will be future vlogs in the coming weeks, probably next Monday I'd say, talking about
98780	101100	these projects in depth and what we plan to do.
101100	104940	But long story short, in about two and a half weeks time, you're gonna start seeing new
104940	110220	content on this channel, and it's mainly going to be political and SJW stuff in nature.
110220	115040	As for gaming and anime content, we will be talking about that in future vlogs as well.
115040	119380	We have some very big plans, we've had these plans for about five or six months now, we
119380	122080	just haven't been able to do them, and now we can.
122080	126100	So thank you guys for sticking around, I have noticed that the sub count has basically remained
126100	131340	static, which is pretty good for a channel that puts out no content for about five months,
131340	132340	so thank you.
132340	137540	I know what you're here for, we will be making it, and if you're interested, please check
137540	142640	out youtube.com slash c slash no talent gaming for our let's plays.
142640	147560	And if you want to join in on the daily stream challenge this month, head on over to twitch.tv
147560	150700	slash short fight out talk, sometime tonight I'll be playing another game.
150700	152380	See you there guys, I love you.
