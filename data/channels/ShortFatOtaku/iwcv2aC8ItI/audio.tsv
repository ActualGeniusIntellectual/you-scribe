0	5920	Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used predominantly by non-black performers to represent
5920	11200	a caricature of a black person. The practice contributed to the spread of racial stereotypes
11200	16560	about black people, and blackface minstrel shows had become a distinctive American art form.
16560	21120	However, by the present day it's largely fallen out of favor and is generally considered offensive
21120	26960	and disrespectful. That is Wikipedia's definition of blackface, and, helpfully included in that
27040	31440	Wikipedia article, is a historical drawing of somebody dressing up in blackface, presumably
31440	35440	as an advertisement for his show, and it's probably pretty easy to see why, yeah, this
35440	40640	could definitely be construed as racist. But nonetheless, blackface has a history of its
40640	45120	racism. You can actually go back over the past 200 years and trace its origins. To contrast,
45120	47840	here's Wikipedia's entry on brownface.
47840	52400	Racial brownface is a variation of blackface in which a person imitates a person of Latin
52400	57440	American, Middle Eastern, North African, Polynesian, Native American, and or South
57440	62160	Asian ethnic origin. This can be done using makeup, hair dye, or by wearing traditional
62160	66960	ethnic clothing. It is typically defined as a racist phenomenon whether or not the offender
66960	71920	intended to be racist. This seems to be the ideological root of cultural appropriation,
71920	75920	because let's say that you're a white guy in Japan and you decide to throw on a kimono,
75920	80240	you are wearing a variant of racial brownface because you're wearing traditional ethnic
80240	85680	clothing. And while both blackface and the complaints against it have a long history,
85680	89200	people have only really been talking about brownface for the past couple years.
89200	96080	The first example in the article, in fact, is The Simpsons coming under fire in 2018
96080	102240	over the character Apu, even though Apu has been in the show for 25 years before that.
102240	106640	Of course, to simply say that brownface doesn't exist seems to be a little bit absurd as well.
106640	111040	Remember when John Wayne played Genghis Khan, because that was back during the era when
111040	115600	Hollywood didn't actually like brown people acting in anything? And yeah, I guess in some of these
115600	121440	pictures they threw some makeup on him, but for the most part he just looks the same.
121440	126000	In any case, the discussion on blackface resurfaced a couple months ago because of
126000	131360	my prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Old photos of him acting as a drama student and as a drama
131360	136320	teacher were found wearing various costumes, including blackface. And so, many articles
136320	140480	were published like this one. This is why brownface and blackface have always been
140480	144080	offensive and always will be. I guess we're just going to skip over the fact that brownface does
144080	149600	not have nearly the same historic implication as blackface does, but whatever, fine, it's the same
149600	155840	thing now, I guess. I chose this article, though, because they seem to at least implicitly understand
155840	160320	that brownface and blackface aren't the same thing, yet they still insist on lumping them
160320	164480	together. What is blackface? Blackface is the art of painting your face in a darker tone to
164480	167920	resemble a black person, while the practice dates back to the racist minstrel shows of the 19th
167920	173120	century, etc. etc. What is brownface? Brownface is different from blackface in that the person is
173120	176880	trying to resemble someone who may be Latin American, Middle Eastern, Polynesian, Native
176880	184000	American, or Indian. Why is it so offensive? Blackface is a practice rooted in history,
184000	188800	yes it is. It's about so much more than just painting your face a darker color, absolutely.
188800	193520	It's surprising, therefore, that in the context of this well-known history, people still find
193520	199760	it acceptable to black up and perform blackface and brownface at parties. Um, nothing here has
199760	204480	described why brownface is so offensive. You're literally just lumping it in together as if it's
204480	208640	the same thing and it has the same historical connotation. Now you might just say, Dev, give
208640	214560	him a pass, it's similar enough. Yeah, the racists of the 19th century didn't conceive of Latinx
214560	218640	face or whatever, but we all know that if they had, they would use it the same way they used
218640	221760	blackface and it would have the same connotation today. And you know, you're probably right,
221760	229680	fair enough. But what about whiteface? Well, Nick Cannon, a black musician, put on whiteface
229680	233520	and there he is. He's got, he's got the white skin, the red hair. He actually got in a little
233520	237280	bit of trouble with this, believe it or not. Not nearly as much as Justin Trudeau putting on
237280	242160	blackface, but still a little bit. But I do think it's telling that, that Nick Cannon went ginger
242720	247520	instead of say black haired or brown haired or blonde haired, but red haired. Because there
247520	253600	definitely seems to be a sort of soft white face happening in Hollywood nowadays. Maybe it's a
253600	258000	hiring white face. I'm not sure. I mean, you've got Halle Bailey, a black woman playing the little
258000	263760	mermaid who was at least in the adaptation that they're going off of a ginger. You've got Anna
263760	270880	Schaefer, who's a half black woman being cast as Tris Merigold, who is again, a ginger. In fact,
270880	276960	there just seems to be a whole lot of instances of white characters, especially white ginger
276960	282000	characters being replaced by black actors and actresses. Don't you dare go the other way around
282000	286080	though. Even if it's just voice acting, if you have black characters, make sure you hire black
286080	291120	voice actors for that job. In general, the flow of outrage regarding race swapping seems to only
291120	297360	happen one way. For example, thousands of black actresses have cosplayed as Sailor Moon, a white
297360	301680	or at least Japanese character, though, to be honest, I'm willing to say white because of the
301680	306880	blonde hair. Meanwhile, if you're a white girl cosplaying as a black character, expect to get
306880	311600	dragged all over the internet. And yes, this picture actually does show the same person.
311600	315840	It doesn't matter that this is a woman who is cosplaying as a man, nobody cares about that.
315840	321760	It's the fact that it's a white girl cosplaying as a black character. Unreal. And even if it's
321760	327360	historically inaccurate, that's okay because it's diversity, you see. That's the thing that's valued
327360	331520	and it doesn't matter if we're talking about cosplay, if we're talking about acting choices
331520	336000	and casting choices, or if we're talking about artwork, doesn't matter. You can find examples
336000	340800	of this nonsense happening all over the internet. Here's a screen grab from that rather mediocre
340800	345760	reimagining of She-Ra the Princess of Power. Well, someone decided to take this exact scene
345760	351120	from the show and redraw it in the old art style with the old character designs, which ended up
351120	356320	turning at least one of the characters white again, since that was their original design.
356320	361840	And as you can expect, the backlash on Twitter was immense, even though this technically isn't
361920	366880	whitewashing because the character was originally white. It happened with Pokemon too, but
366880	373840	even stupider. This is Nessa, the water gym leader from the newest Pokemon games. She is obviously a
373840	379600	darker-skinned woman. A Japanese artist drew her in a pastel style, which had the added effect of
379600	386320	making her skin not as dark as it originally was. And the entire internet basically blew up,
386320	391600	screaming about whitewashing and racism and this and that. And how dare they take a character that
392480	395120	is a person of colour and make them white. Even though to be honest, when I look at the original
395120	399120	artwork, I don't really see that. Do you? Of course, the internet, being what it is,
399680	405200	in response to this, actually started drawing Nessa as white and even went so far as modding
405200	411360	the game to make her white. Nessa is the only Pokemon character I've ever seen with skin like
411360	416960	mine. And I know this sounds cheesy, but I almost cried when a bunch of artists started making her
416960	427280	a white person or with light skin. You all hate us so bad that we can't even exist in fucking
427280	432240	Pokemon. You know, Pokemon is a series of games that takes place all over the world. It's set in
432240	439360	Japan, the UK, France, New York, Hawaii, and as such, there's a lot of people in the series of
439360	444640	every single race. Nessa was not the first black person to appear in Pokemon. But things devolved
444640	454560	into colourism rather quickly, because here's a person who got a deep tan to cosplay as Nessa,
454560	461680	and then here's a black cosplayer who, by the way, is quite light skinned herself for a black
461680	466960	person saying, my dude, listen, tanning is still blackface when you go out of your way to tan to
466960	472000	be a black character. And here's that same woman on a different day. Hey guys, I got called white
472000	477120	face scum because I'm not dark enough to be considered black by them. Please these internet
477120	482480	trolls try so hard it's fucking hilarious. No, they're literally operating off the same rule
482480	487280	set that you operate off of. You have nothing to complain about. Though I think the funniest
487280	493200	instance of all is an artist not knowing who Black Panther was and only understood his suit,
494080	501280	drew him as a white guy. And the resulting fallout was amazing. I don't know if you can read it here.
501280	508160	You literally whitewash, disrespect, insult, spit on black people and expect to be praised for it.
508160	512560	And you have the fucking nerve to call us hypocrites. Well, yeah, actually I do.
512560	517760	When white characters are being changed into black characters, you don't bat an eye. Unless
517760	522160	they're doing blackface, of course, unless it's a white person wearing wearing blackface. That's
522160	526160	different, even though it's still white going to black. I mean, here's the Sailor Moon argument
526160	530640	again. There are thousands of bits of artwork where people take characters that are either
530640	535520	white or Asian. I mean, it depends. It's anime, right? But white or Asian and make them very
535520	541520	obviously not either of those things. No one cares. No one bats an eye. No one shrieks racism
541520	545360	at this. But do it with Black Panther and oh shit, it's on. Because we're talking about the
545360	550880	radical left here and because the radical left values only power as shown to us by their love
550880	556640	of power politics as the ultimate descriptor and predictor of everything that they do as the lens
556640	561680	through which they see the world. Blackface and brownface or whitewashing and blackwashing,
561680	566000	depending on what we're talking about, all of that stuff is only bad depending on who has the
566000	571760	power in the situation. So when someone who is white transforms into someone who is black,
571760	576880	if it's done in a way to say mock black people, if it's done in a way where the white person has
576880	581760	the power, then it's racist and it's terrible. But if it's done not to mock black people, but
581760	587040	to erase white people, well, then it's fine. Even though you're still taking a white figure
587040	592000	and making it black, it's actually OK in this instance because the black person has the power.
592000	597840	This is why Nathan Grayson believes that Twitch has a racist emote problem because there are
597840	603760	emotes of black people on Twitch and white people use them. That is, in essence, a white person
603760	608560	presenting a black message. The whiteness is going to blackness. But because the white person
608560	614400	has the power, that's the problem. That's why The Guardian thinks that it's digital blackface
614400	620160	when black people reacting as part of memes online got so popular around last year or so,
620160	625280	because it's not actually a black voice. There's no black power involved. It's simply,
625280	631920	presumably, again, a white person using a black person's face, hence digital blackface.
631920	635840	And if we're really going down the logic of cultural appropriation, if it is the case that
635840	641360	a white person taking something from the domain of the black and using it for their own ends is
641360	645760	blackface, even though a black person taking something from the domain of the white and using
645760	650720	it for their own ends is empowering or something, then there's many more forms of blackface than
650720	655360	what we thought, not just the digital blackface. How about mispronouncing names? You've got the
655360	662480	three authors of this article, Kaya Roy, Zahira Ali and Medha Kumar. I probably mispronounced all
662480	668400	of those, but I took their black name and I made it white with my mispronunciation. This is
668400	674000	linguistic blackface in a sense. Or what about political blackface? Here's a white woman saying
674000	679360	that black Twitter ain't having no Bernie. I mean, she would know, right? But then we come to the
679360	685440	most insidious form of blackface of all, intellectual blackface. Diversity of thought is just a euphemism
685440	691360	for white supremacy, a breakdown of why free thought actually translates to white thought.
691360	696480	There's an epidemic out there of black people who are thinking white. And if they're thinking white,
697040	701840	that means that it's white people who have the power parading around those black faces and black
701840	706400	bodies inhabited with white thoughts. The angry black woman stereotype is making it damn near
706400	710720	impossible for black women to get mental health care. Well, as far as I can see it, mental health
710720	714480	care is probably a privilege, which means that you're going to be thinking white, which means
714480	718720	that if you want it as a proud black woman, you're gonna have to think white to get it. And you have
718720	724880	to understand, you need to stay in your lane. PSA Sitch recently linked on his Twitter account a
724880	731440	very interesting study talking about just how many black people are inhabited by white thoughts.
731440	737840	Because as it turns out, between 2006 and 2007, every 100 bachelor's degrees conferred on black
737840	744000	men, 196 were conferred on black women. And as Sitch says, the SJW idea that black women are
744000	748480	the most disenfranchised, thus deserve the most power in their movement, may be completely
748480	753440	backwards. Oh, oh, are black women more on top than they thought? Well, it's because all of those
753440	758800	offending black women who dare to excel, they're inhabited by white thoughts and their racism needs
758800	763280	to be stopped. This whole attitude can basically be summed up by this headline. Liberals clarify
763280	768160	they only want black voices to be heard when they're saying liberal things. But Dev, you may ask,
768160	772880	that's from the Babylon Bee. It's a joke article. Yeah, but it's still the truth. Do you want to
772880	778720	hear it from their own mouths? Here's a member of AOC's squad, Ayanna Pressley, saying basically
778720	783200	the same thing that I've been saying this whole video. For whatever lived experience and identity
783200	789920	that you represent, if you are not prepared to come to that table, and to represent that voice,
789920	797040	don't come. Because we don't need any more brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice. We
797040	801920	don't need black faces that don't want to be a black voice. We don't need Muslims that don't want
801920	810160	to be a Muslim voice. We don't need queers that don't want to be a queer voice. So you see,
810160	815200	it's not enough to just be a black person. You have to be a black person with black thoughts.
815760	820080	If you're a black person with white thoughts, you're not welcome. You're not really black
820080	825440	anymore. And you know what? This logic can be applied to anything, really. Anything that's
825440	831600	not you is a face. Am I the only person fed up of drag shows, a parody of what a real woman is,
831600	836000	like blackface? And really, you can't argue with this, can you? If the original definition of
836000	842000	blackface was basically a theater style where white people would dress up as caricatures of
842000	847360	black people and look exaggerated and act exaggerated for comedic effect, then how does
847360	853360	that not describe the relationship between drag queen shows and women? Really, at this point,
853360	858160	with the way things have gone, with the way definitions have been stretched, any facsimile,
858160	865120	any act, any bit of deception, it's all a face. I mean, any woman that you see wearing makeup,
865680	870080	is she wearing like beautiful face or something because maybe she's not quite that good looking
870080	874560	underneath? I don't know. However, like I said earlier, it's all about that power,
875200	879920	which is why it can go one way from the privileged to the oppressed, but not the other.
879920	885440	As the very helpful social justice YouTube channel NowThis News is going to teach us in
885440	890800	The Myth of Blackwashing. From Liam Neeson in Batman Begins to Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in
890800	897840	the Shell and, well, pretty much any US anime adaptation ever, whitewashing is when Hollywood
897840	902400	takes a character who is a person of color in the source material and casts a white actor for
902400	906480	the final portrayal we see on screen. Yeah, it took Hollywood a long time to actually accept
906480	910880	people of color as people. I guess that's what happens when you're run by 1940s Democrats.
910880	914320	What about when a white character is played by a person of color on screen?
914960	919440	Representation might upset some people who can't accept popular comic book characters like
919440	924800	Nick Fury, Johnny Storm, and Domino as people of color, but this thing some people call
924800	930480	blackwashing is not a problem. It's not even a thing. But let's start with why whitewashing
930480	936000	is so harmful. See, so blackwashing doesn't exist, but whitewashing does because it's all about
936000	940800	representation. It's all about the direction of the flow of power. Taking a character that
940800	945360	is a person of color and making them white? Well, you might as well be slapping on the blackface
945360	950960	makeup yourself. But taking a white character and making them black? That's just balancing the
950960	955840	scales. It's just punching up. And Zazie Beetz could do the same for Domino. I grew up watching
955840	960480	Domino on Wolverine and the X-Men, where she's portrayed with comics-accurate pale blue skin
960480	965680	and a black circle around her eye. Now she's a black woman with natural hair and her traditional
965680	970960	look is still there right down to the eye tattoo. It's just inverted now. But see, that looks lazy.
972400	975680	And it's not because she's black. It's because the original character was blue.
976240	979840	Like, you could have taken this black actress and made her blue. Still have her played by a
979840	985280	black woman, but the character is supposed to be blue, so make her blue. Or does blackness just
985280	991840	not count if the character is not actually black, even though they're played by a black person? Oh
991840	996000	wait, that's exactly the case! We're yet to see a black woman wield a lightsaber in a Star Wars
996000	1001600	movie! Well, I mean, there's this one. Does she not count because even though the actress is black,
1001600	1007680	she's blue? Well, there's also this one. But does she not count because even though she's a black
1007680	1011760	actress wielding a lightsaber, she has alien tentacles growing out of her head? But like I
1011760	1016000	said, it's all about who has the power. And I guess more specifically, who that power would benefit,
1016000	1022560	and how. When news outlets take black or brown criminals and make them look whiter or paler,
1022560	1028240	no one complains then. No one screeches about white washing or white face or black representation
1028240	1033120	or whatever the fuck. Because at the end of the day, black people and brown people have the
1033120	1039600	privilege of face. They can do things, say things, and think things that if white people did it,
1039600	1044480	would be racist. And the liberalistic, individualistic, democratic idea that black
1044480	1049120	people be judged not by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character,
1049120	1053200	well that might have sounded pretty good on paper about 60 or so years ago, but progressives have
1053200	1058800	since discovered that asking them to do so is like asking them to think white. We know better now.
1058800	1063440	You see, we understand that asking black people to be responsible moral agents
1063440	1066560	is asking them to wear intellectual blackface.
