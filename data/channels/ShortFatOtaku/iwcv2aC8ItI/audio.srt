1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used predominantly by non-black performers to represent

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,200
a caricature of a black person. The practice contributed to the spread of racial stereotypes

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,560
about black people, and blackface minstrel shows had become a distinctive American art form.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,120
However, by the present day it's largely fallen out of favor and is generally considered offensive

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,960
and disrespectful. That is Wikipedia's definition of blackface, and, helpfully included in that

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,440
Wikipedia article, is a historical drawing of somebody dressing up in blackface, presumably

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,440
as an advertisement for his show, and it's probably pretty easy to see why, yeah, this

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,640
could definitely be construed as racist. But nonetheless, blackface has a history of its

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,120
racism. You can actually go back over the past 200 years and trace its origins. To contrast,

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,840
here's Wikipedia's entry on brownface.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,400
Racial brownface is a variation of blackface in which a person imitates a person of Latin

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,440
American, Middle Eastern, North African, Polynesian, Native American, and or South

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,160
Asian ethnic origin. This can be done using makeup, hair dye, or by wearing traditional

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,960
ethnic clothing. It is typically defined as a racist phenomenon whether or not the offender

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,920
intended to be racist. This seems to be the ideological root of cultural appropriation,

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,920
because let's say that you're a white guy in Japan and you decide to throw on a kimono,

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,240
you are wearing a variant of racial brownface because you're wearing traditional ethnic

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,680
clothing. And while both blackface and the complaints against it have a long history,

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,200
people have only really been talking about brownface for the past couple years.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,080
The first example in the article, in fact, is The Simpsons coming under fire in 2018

21
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,240
over the character Apu, even though Apu has been in the show for 25 years before that.

22
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,640
Of course, to simply say that brownface doesn't exist seems to be a little bit absurd as well.

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,040
Remember when John Wayne played Genghis Khan, because that was back during the era when

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,600
Hollywood didn't actually like brown people acting in anything? And yeah, I guess in some of these

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,440
pictures they threw some makeup on him, but for the most part he just looks the same.

26
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,000
In any case, the discussion on blackface resurfaced a couple months ago because of

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,360
my prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Old photos of him acting as a drama student and as a drama

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,320
teacher were found wearing various costumes, including blackface. And so, many articles

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,480
were published like this one. This is why brownface and blackface have always been

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,080
offensive and always will be. I guess we're just going to skip over the fact that brownface does

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,600
not have nearly the same historic implication as blackface does, but whatever, fine, it's the same

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,840
thing now, I guess. I chose this article, though, because they seem to at least implicitly understand

33
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,320
that brownface and blackface aren't the same thing, yet they still insist on lumping them

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,480
together. What is blackface? Blackface is the art of painting your face in a darker tone to

35
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,920
resemble a black person, while the practice dates back to the racist minstrel shows of the 19th

36
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,120
century, etc. etc. What is brownface? Brownface is different from blackface in that the person is

37
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,880
trying to resemble someone who may be Latin American, Middle Eastern, Polynesian, Native

38
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:04,000
American, or Indian. Why is it so offensive? Blackface is a practice rooted in history,

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,800
yes it is. It's about so much more than just painting your face a darker color, absolutely.

40
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,520
It's surprising, therefore, that in the context of this well-known history, people still find

41
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,760
it acceptable to black up and perform blackface and brownface at parties. Um, nothing here has

42
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,480
described why brownface is so offensive. You're literally just lumping it in together as if it's

43
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,640
the same thing and it has the same historical connotation. Now you might just say, Dev, give

44
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,560
him a pass, it's similar enough. Yeah, the racists of the 19th century didn't conceive of Latinx

45
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,640
face or whatever, but we all know that if they had, they would use it the same way they used

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,760
blackface and it would have the same connotation today. And you know, you're probably right,

47
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:49,680
fair enough. But what about whiteface? Well, Nick Cannon, a black musician, put on whiteface

48
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,520
and there he is. He's got, he's got the white skin, the red hair. He actually got in a little

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,280
bit of trouble with this, believe it or not. Not nearly as much as Justin Trudeau putting on

50
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,160
blackface, but still a little bit. But I do think it's telling that, that Nick Cannon went ginger

51
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,520
instead of say black haired or brown haired or blonde haired, but red haired. Because there

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,600
definitely seems to be a sort of soft white face happening in Hollywood nowadays. Maybe it's a

53
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,000
hiring white face. I'm not sure. I mean, you've got Halle Bailey, a black woman playing the little

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,760
mermaid who was at least in the adaptation that they're going off of a ginger. You've got Anna

55
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,880
Schaefer, who's a half black woman being cast as Tris Merigold, who is again, a ginger. In fact,

56
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,960
there just seems to be a whole lot of instances of white characters, especially white ginger

57
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,000
characters being replaced by black actors and actresses. Don't you dare go the other way around

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,080
though. Even if it's just voice acting, if you have black characters, make sure you hire black

59
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,120
voice actors for that job. In general, the flow of outrage regarding race swapping seems to only

60
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,360
happen one way. For example, thousands of black actresses have cosplayed as Sailor Moon, a white

61
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,680
or at least Japanese character, though, to be honest, I'm willing to say white because of the

62
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,880
blonde hair. Meanwhile, if you're a white girl cosplaying as a black character, expect to get

63
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,600
dragged all over the internet. And yes, this picture actually does show the same person.

64
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,840
It doesn't matter that this is a woman who is cosplaying as a man, nobody cares about that.

65
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,760
It's the fact that it's a white girl cosplaying as a black character. Unreal. And even if it's

66
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,360
historically inaccurate, that's okay because it's diversity, you see. That's the thing that's valued

67
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,520
and it doesn't matter if we're talking about cosplay, if we're talking about acting choices

68
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,000
and casting choices, or if we're talking about artwork, doesn't matter. You can find examples

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,800
of this nonsense happening all over the internet. Here's a screen grab from that rather mediocre

70
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,760
reimagining of She-Ra the Princess of Power. Well, someone decided to take this exact scene

71
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,120
from the show and redraw it in the old art style with the old character designs, which ended up

72
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,320
turning at least one of the characters white again, since that was their original design.

73
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,840
And as you can expect, the backlash on Twitter was immense, even though this technically isn't

74
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,880
whitewashing because the character was originally white. It happened with Pokemon too, but

75
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,840
even stupider. This is Nessa, the water gym leader from the newest Pokemon games. She is obviously a

76
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,600
darker-skinned woman. A Japanese artist drew her in a pastel style, which had the added effect of

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,320
making her skin not as dark as it originally was. And the entire internet basically blew up,

78
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,600
screaming about whitewashing and racism and this and that. And how dare they take a character that

79
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,120
is a person of colour and make them white. Even though to be honest, when I look at the original

80
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
artwork, I don't really see that. Do you? Of course, the internet, being what it is,

81
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,200
in response to this, actually started drawing Nessa as white and even went so far as modding

82
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:51,360
the game to make her white. Nessa is the only Pokemon character I've ever seen with skin like

83
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,960
mine. And I know this sounds cheesy, but I almost cried when a bunch of artists started making her

84
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:07,280
a white person or with light skin. You all hate us so bad that we can't even exist in fucking

85
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,240
Pokemon. You know, Pokemon is a series of games that takes place all over the world. It's set in

86
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,360
Japan, the UK, France, New York, Hawaii, and as such, there's a lot of people in the series of

87
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,640
every single race. Nessa was not the first black person to appear in Pokemon. But things devolved

88
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:34,560
into colourism rather quickly, because here's a person who got a deep tan to cosplay as Nessa,

89
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,680
and then here's a black cosplayer who, by the way, is quite light skinned herself for a black

90
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,960
person saying, my dude, listen, tanning is still blackface when you go out of your way to tan to

91
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,000
be a black character. And here's that same woman on a different day. Hey guys, I got called white

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,120
face scum because I'm not dark enough to be considered black by them. Please these internet

93
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,480
trolls try so hard it's fucking hilarious. No, they're literally operating off the same rule

94
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,280
set that you operate off of. You have nothing to complain about. Though I think the funniest

95
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,200
instance of all is an artist not knowing who Black Panther was and only understood his suit,

96
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:21,280
drew him as a white guy. And the resulting fallout was amazing. I don't know if you can read it here.

97
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,160
You literally whitewash, disrespect, insult, spit on black people and expect to be praised for it.

98
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,560
And you have the fucking nerve to call us hypocrites. Well, yeah, actually I do.

99
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,760
When white characters are being changed into black characters, you don't bat an eye. Unless

100
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,160
they're doing blackface, of course, unless it's a white person wearing wearing blackface. That's

101
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,160
different, even though it's still white going to black. I mean, here's the Sailor Moon argument

102
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,640
again. There are thousands of bits of artwork where people take characters that are either

103
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,520
white or Asian. I mean, it depends. It's anime, right? But white or Asian and make them very

104
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,520
obviously not either of those things. No one cares. No one bats an eye. No one shrieks racism

105
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,360
at this. But do it with Black Panther and oh shit, it's on. Because we're talking about the

106
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,880
radical left here and because the radical left values only power as shown to us by their love

107
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,640
of power politics as the ultimate descriptor and predictor of everything that they do as the lens

108
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,680
through which they see the world. Blackface and brownface or whitewashing and blackwashing,

109
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,000
depending on what we're talking about, all of that stuff is only bad depending on who has the

110
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,760
power in the situation. So when someone who is white transforms into someone who is black,

111
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,880
if it's done in a way to say mock black people, if it's done in a way where the white person has

112
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,760
the power, then it's racist and it's terrible. But if it's done not to mock black people, but

113
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,040
to erase white people, well, then it's fine. Even though you're still taking a white figure

114
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,000
and making it black, it's actually OK in this instance because the black person has the power.

115
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,840
This is why Nathan Grayson believes that Twitch has a racist emote problem because there are

116
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,760
emotes of black people on Twitch and white people use them. That is, in essence, a white person

117
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,560
presenting a black message. The whiteness is going to blackness. But because the white person

118
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,400
has the power, that's the problem. That's why The Guardian thinks that it's digital blackface

119
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,160
when black people reacting as part of memes online got so popular around last year or so,

120
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,280
because it's not actually a black voice. There's no black power involved. It's simply,

121
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:31,920
presumably, again, a white person using a black person's face, hence digital blackface.

122
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,840
And if we're really going down the logic of cultural appropriation, if it is the case that

123
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,360
a white person taking something from the domain of the black and using it for their own ends is

124
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,760
blackface, even though a black person taking something from the domain of the white and using

125
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,720
it for their own ends is empowering or something, then there's many more forms of blackface than

126
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,360
what we thought, not just the digital blackface. How about mispronouncing names? You've got the

127
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,480
three authors of this article, Kaya Roy, Zahira Ali and Medha Kumar. I probably mispronounced all

128
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,400
of those, but I took their black name and I made it white with my mispronunciation. This is

129
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:14,000
linguistic blackface in a sense. Or what about political blackface? Here's a white woman saying

130
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,360
that black Twitter ain't having no Bernie. I mean, she would know, right? But then we come to the

131
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,440
most insidious form of blackface of all, intellectual blackface. Diversity of thought is just a euphemism

132
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,360
for white supremacy, a breakdown of why free thought actually translates to white thought.

133
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,480
There's an epidemic out there of black people who are thinking white. And if they're thinking white,

134
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,840
that means that it's white people who have the power parading around those black faces and black

135
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,400
bodies inhabited with white thoughts. The angry black woman stereotype is making it damn near

136
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,720
impossible for black women to get mental health care. Well, as far as I can see it, mental health

137
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,480
care is probably a privilege, which means that you're going to be thinking white, which means

138
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,720
that if you want it as a proud black woman, you're gonna have to think white to get it. And you have

139
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,880
to understand, you need to stay in your lane. PSA Sitch recently linked on his Twitter account a

140
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,440
very interesting study talking about just how many black people are inhabited by white thoughts.

141
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,840
Because as it turns out, between 2006 and 2007, every 100 bachelor's degrees conferred on black

142
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:24,000
men, 196 were conferred on black women. And as Sitch says, the SJW idea that black women are

143
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,480
the most disenfranchised, thus deserve the most power in their movement, may be completely

144
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,440
backwards. Oh, oh, are black women more on top than they thought? Well, it's because all of those

145
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,800
offending black women who dare to excel, they're inhabited by white thoughts and their racism needs

146
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,280
to be stopped. This whole attitude can basically be summed up by this headline. Liberals clarify

147
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,160
they only want black voices to be heard when they're saying liberal things. But Dev, you may ask,

148
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,880
that's from the Babylon Bee. It's a joke article. Yeah, but it's still the truth. Do you want to

149
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,720
hear it from their own mouths? Here's a member of AOC's squad, Ayanna Pressley, saying basically

150
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,200
the same thing that I've been saying this whole video. For whatever lived experience and identity

151
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,920
that you represent, if you are not prepared to come to that table, and to represent that voice,

152
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:17,040
don't come. Because we don't need any more brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice. We

153
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,920
don't need black faces that don't want to be a black voice. We don't need Muslims that don't want

154
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:30,160
to be a Muslim voice. We don't need queers that don't want to be a queer voice. So you see,

155
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,200
it's not enough to just be a black person. You have to be a black person with black thoughts.

156
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,080
If you're a black person with white thoughts, you're not welcome. You're not really black

157
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,440
anymore. And you know what? This logic can be applied to anything, really. Anything that's

158
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,600
not you is a face. Am I the only person fed up of drag shows, a parody of what a real woman is,

159
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,000
like blackface? And really, you can't argue with this, can you? If the original definition of

160
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
blackface was basically a theater style where white people would dress up as caricatures of

161
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,360
black people and look exaggerated and act exaggerated for comedic effect, then how does

162
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,360
that not describe the relationship between drag queen shows and women? Really, at this point,

163
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,160
with the way things have gone, with the way definitions have been stretched, any facsimile,

164
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:25,120
any act, any bit of deception, it's all a face. I mean, any woman that you see wearing makeup,

165
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,080
is she wearing like beautiful face or something because maybe she's not quite that good looking

166
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,560
underneath? I don't know. However, like I said earlier, it's all about that power,

167
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,920
which is why it can go one way from the privileged to the oppressed, but not the other.

168
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,440
As the very helpful social justice YouTube channel NowThis News is going to teach us in

169
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,800
The Myth of Blackwashing. From Liam Neeson in Batman Begins to Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in

170
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,840
the Shell and, well, pretty much any US anime adaptation ever, whitewashing is when Hollywood

171
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,400
takes a character who is a person of color in the source material and casts a white actor for

172
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,480
the final portrayal we see on screen. Yeah, it took Hollywood a long time to actually accept

173
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,880
people of color as people. I guess that's what happens when you're run by 1940s Democrats.

174
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,320
What about when a white character is played by a person of color on screen?

175
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,440
Representation might upset some people who can't accept popular comic book characters like

176
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,800
Nick Fury, Johnny Storm, and Domino as people of color, but this thing some people call

177
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,480
blackwashing is not a problem. It's not even a thing. But let's start with why whitewashing

178
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,000
is so harmful. See, so blackwashing doesn't exist, but whitewashing does because it's all about

179
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,800
representation. It's all about the direction of the flow of power. Taking a character that

180
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,360
is a person of color and making them white? Well, you might as well be slapping on the blackface

181
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,960
makeup yourself. But taking a white character and making them black? That's just balancing the

182
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,840
scales. It's just punching up. And Zazie Beetz could do the same for Domino. I grew up watching

183
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,480
Domino on Wolverine and the X-Men, where she's portrayed with comics-accurate pale blue skin

184
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,680
and a black circle around her eye. Now she's a black woman with natural hair and her traditional

185
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,960
look is still there right down to the eye tattoo. It's just inverted now. But see, that looks lazy.

186
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,680
And it's not because she's black. It's because the original character was blue.

187
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,840
Like, you could have taken this black actress and made her blue. Still have her played by a

188
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,280
black woman, but the character is supposed to be blue, so make her blue. Or does blackness just

189
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:31,840
not count if the character is not actually black, even though they're played by a black person? Oh

190
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,000
wait, that's exactly the case! We're yet to see a black woman wield a lightsaber in a Star Wars

191
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,600
movie! Well, I mean, there's this one. Does she not count because even though the actress is black,

192
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,680
she's blue? Well, there's also this one. But does she not count because even though she's a black

193
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,760
actress wielding a lightsaber, she has alien tentacles growing out of her head? But like I

194
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,000
said, it's all about who has the power. And I guess more specifically, who that power would benefit,

195
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,560
and how. When news outlets take black or brown criminals and make them look whiter or paler,

196
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,240
no one complains then. No one screeches about white washing or white face or black representation

197
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,120
or whatever the fuck. Because at the end of the day, black people and brown people have the

198
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,600
privilege of face. They can do things, say things, and think things that if white people did it,

199
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,480
would be racist. And the liberalistic, individualistic, democratic idea that black

200
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,120
people be judged not by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character,

201
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,200
well that might have sounded pretty good on paper about 60 or so years ago, but progressives have

202
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,800
since discovered that asking them to do so is like asking them to think white. We know better now.

203
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,440
You see, we understand that asking black people to be responsible moral agents

204
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,560
is asking them to wear intellectual blackface.
