00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used predominantly by non-black performers to represent

00:05.920 --> 00:11.200
a caricature of a black person. The practice contributed to the spread of racial stereotypes

00:11.200 --> 00:16.560
about black people, and blackface minstrel shows had become a distinctive American art form.

00:16.560 --> 00:21.120
However, by the present day it's largely fallen out of favor and is generally considered offensive

00:21.120 --> 00:26.960
and disrespectful. That is Wikipedia's definition of blackface, and, helpfully included in that

00:27.040 --> 00:31.440
Wikipedia article, is a historical drawing of somebody dressing up in blackface, presumably

00:31.440 --> 00:35.440
as an advertisement for his show, and it's probably pretty easy to see why, yeah, this

00:35.440 --> 00:40.640
could definitely be construed as racist. But nonetheless, blackface has a history of its

00:40.640 --> 00:45.120
racism. You can actually go back over the past 200 years and trace its origins. To contrast,

00:45.120 --> 00:47.840
here's Wikipedia's entry on brownface.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.400
Racial brownface is a variation of blackface in which a person imitates a person of Latin

00:52.400 --> 00:57.440
American, Middle Eastern, North African, Polynesian, Native American, and or South

00:57.440 --> 01:02.160
Asian ethnic origin. This can be done using makeup, hair dye, or by wearing traditional

01:02.160 --> 01:06.960
ethnic clothing. It is typically defined as a racist phenomenon whether or not the offender

01:06.960 --> 01:11.920
intended to be racist. This seems to be the ideological root of cultural appropriation,

01:11.920 --> 01:15.920
because let's say that you're a white guy in Japan and you decide to throw on a kimono,

01:15.920 --> 01:20.240
you are wearing a variant of racial brownface because you're wearing traditional ethnic

01:20.240 --> 01:25.680
clothing. And while both blackface and the complaints against it have a long history,

01:25.680 --> 01:29.200
people have only really been talking about brownface for the past couple years.

01:29.200 --> 01:36.080
The first example in the article, in fact, is The Simpsons coming under fire in 2018

01:36.080 --> 01:42.240
over the character Apu, even though Apu has been in the show for 25 years before that.

01:42.240 --> 01:46.640
Of course, to simply say that brownface doesn't exist seems to be a little bit absurd as well.

01:46.640 --> 01:51.040
Remember when John Wayne played Genghis Khan, because that was back during the era when

01:51.040 --> 01:55.600
Hollywood didn't actually like brown people acting in anything? And yeah, I guess in some of these

01:55.600 --> 02:01.440
pictures they threw some makeup on him, but for the most part he just looks the same.

02:01.440 --> 02:06.000
In any case, the discussion on blackface resurfaced a couple months ago because of

02:06.000 --> 02:11.360
my prime minister, Justin Trudeau. Old photos of him acting as a drama student and as a drama

02:11.360 --> 02:16.320
teacher were found wearing various costumes, including blackface. And so, many articles

02:16.320 --> 02:20.480
were published like this one. This is why brownface and blackface have always been

02:20.480 --> 02:24.080
offensive and always will be. I guess we're just going to skip over the fact that brownface does

02:24.080 --> 02:29.600
not have nearly the same historic implication as blackface does, but whatever, fine, it's the same

02:29.600 --> 02:35.840
thing now, I guess. I chose this article, though, because they seem to at least implicitly understand

02:35.840 --> 02:40.320
that brownface and blackface aren't the same thing, yet they still insist on lumping them

02:40.320 --> 02:44.480
together. What is blackface? Blackface is the art of painting your face in a darker tone to

02:44.480 --> 02:47.920
resemble a black person, while the practice dates back to the racist minstrel shows of the 19th

02:47.920 --> 02:53.120
century, etc. etc. What is brownface? Brownface is different from blackface in that the person is

02:53.120 --> 02:56.880
trying to resemble someone who may be Latin American, Middle Eastern, Polynesian, Native

02:56.880 --> 03:04.000
American, or Indian. Why is it so offensive? Blackface is a practice rooted in history,

03:04.000 --> 03:08.800
yes it is. It's about so much more than just painting your face a darker color, absolutely.

03:08.800 --> 03:13.520
It's surprising, therefore, that in the context of this well-known history, people still find

03:13.520 --> 03:19.760
it acceptable to black up and perform blackface and brownface at parties. Um, nothing here has

03:19.760 --> 03:24.480
described why brownface is so offensive. You're literally just lumping it in together as if it's

03:24.480 --> 03:28.640
the same thing and it has the same historical connotation. Now you might just say, Dev, give

03:28.640 --> 03:34.560
him a pass, it's similar enough. Yeah, the racists of the 19th century didn't conceive of Latinx

03:34.560 --> 03:38.640
face or whatever, but we all know that if they had, they would use it the same way they used

03:38.640 --> 03:41.760
blackface and it would have the same connotation today. And you know, you're probably right,

03:41.760 --> 03:49.680
fair enough. But what about whiteface? Well, Nick Cannon, a black musician, put on whiteface

03:49.680 --> 03:53.520
and there he is. He's got, he's got the white skin, the red hair. He actually got in a little

03:53.520 --> 03:57.280
bit of trouble with this, believe it or not. Not nearly as much as Justin Trudeau putting on

03:57.280 --> 04:02.160
blackface, but still a little bit. But I do think it's telling that, that Nick Cannon went ginger

04:02.720 --> 04:07.520
instead of say black haired or brown haired or blonde haired, but red haired. Because there

04:07.520 --> 04:13.600
definitely seems to be a sort of soft white face happening in Hollywood nowadays. Maybe it's a

04:13.600 --> 04:18.000
hiring white face. I'm not sure. I mean, you've got Halle Bailey, a black woman playing the little

04:18.000 --> 04:23.760
mermaid who was at least in the adaptation that they're going off of a ginger. You've got Anna

04:23.760 --> 04:30.880
Schaefer, who's a half black woman being cast as Tris Merigold, who is again, a ginger. In fact,

04:30.880 --> 04:36.960
there just seems to be a whole lot of instances of white characters, especially white ginger

04:36.960 --> 04:42.000
characters being replaced by black actors and actresses. Don't you dare go the other way around

04:42.000 --> 04:46.080
though. Even if it's just voice acting, if you have black characters, make sure you hire black

04:46.080 --> 04:51.120
voice actors for that job. In general, the flow of outrage regarding race swapping seems to only

04:51.120 --> 04:57.360
happen one way. For example, thousands of black actresses have cosplayed as Sailor Moon, a white

04:57.360 --> 05:01.680
or at least Japanese character, though, to be honest, I'm willing to say white because of the

05:01.680 --> 05:06.880
blonde hair. Meanwhile, if you're a white girl cosplaying as a black character, expect to get

05:06.880 --> 05:11.600
dragged all over the internet. And yes, this picture actually does show the same person.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.840
It doesn't matter that this is a woman who is cosplaying as a man, nobody cares about that.

05:15.840 --> 05:21.760
It's the fact that it's a white girl cosplaying as a black character. Unreal. And even if it's

05:21.760 --> 05:27.360
historically inaccurate, that's okay because it's diversity, you see. That's the thing that's valued

05:27.360 --> 05:31.520
and it doesn't matter if we're talking about cosplay, if we're talking about acting choices

05:31.520 --> 05:36.000
and casting choices, or if we're talking about artwork, doesn't matter. You can find examples

05:36.000 --> 05:40.800
of this nonsense happening all over the internet. Here's a screen grab from that rather mediocre

05:40.800 --> 05:45.760
reimagining of She-Ra the Princess of Power. Well, someone decided to take this exact scene

05:45.760 --> 05:51.120
from the show and redraw it in the old art style with the old character designs, which ended up

05:51.120 --> 05:56.320
turning at least one of the characters white again, since that was their original design.

05:56.320 --> 06:01.840
And as you can expect, the backlash on Twitter was immense, even though this technically isn't

06:01.920 --> 06:06.880
whitewashing because the character was originally white. It happened with Pokemon too, but

06:06.880 --> 06:13.840
even stupider. This is Nessa, the water gym leader from the newest Pokemon games. She is obviously a

06:13.840 --> 06:19.600
darker-skinned woman. A Japanese artist drew her in a pastel style, which had the added effect of

06:19.600 --> 06:26.320
making her skin not as dark as it originally was. And the entire internet basically blew up,

06:26.320 --> 06:31.600
screaming about whitewashing and racism and this and that. And how dare they take a character that

06:32.480 --> 06:35.120
is a person of colour and make them white. Even though to be honest, when I look at the original

06:35.120 --> 06:39.120
artwork, I don't really see that. Do you? Of course, the internet, being what it is,

06:39.680 --> 06:45.200
in response to this, actually started drawing Nessa as white and even went so far as modding

06:45.200 --> 06:51.360
the game to make her white. Nessa is the only Pokemon character I've ever seen with skin like

06:51.360 --> 06:56.960
mine. And I know this sounds cheesy, but I almost cried when a bunch of artists started making her

06:56.960 --> 07:07.280
a white person or with light skin. You all hate us so bad that we can't even exist in fucking

07:07.280 --> 07:12.240
Pokemon. You know, Pokemon is a series of games that takes place all over the world. It's set in

07:12.240 --> 07:19.360
Japan, the UK, France, New York, Hawaii, and as such, there's a lot of people in the series of

07:19.360 --> 07:24.640
every single race. Nessa was not the first black person to appear in Pokemon. But things devolved

07:24.640 --> 07:34.560
into colourism rather quickly, because here's a person who got a deep tan to cosplay as Nessa,

07:34.560 --> 07:41.680
and then here's a black cosplayer who, by the way, is quite light skinned herself for a black

07:41.680 --> 07:46.960
person saying, my dude, listen, tanning is still blackface when you go out of your way to tan to

07:46.960 --> 07:52.000
be a black character. And here's that same woman on a different day. Hey guys, I got called white

07:52.000 --> 07:57.120
face scum because I'm not dark enough to be considered black by them. Please these internet

07:57.120 --> 08:02.480
trolls try so hard it's fucking hilarious. No, they're literally operating off the same rule

08:02.480 --> 08:07.280
set that you operate off of. You have nothing to complain about. Though I think the funniest

08:07.280 --> 08:13.200
instance of all is an artist not knowing who Black Panther was and only understood his suit,

08:14.080 --> 08:21.280
drew him as a white guy. And the resulting fallout was amazing. I don't know if you can read it here.

08:21.280 --> 08:28.160
You literally whitewash, disrespect, insult, spit on black people and expect to be praised for it.

08:28.160 --> 08:32.560
And you have the fucking nerve to call us hypocrites. Well, yeah, actually I do.

08:32.560 --> 08:37.760
When white characters are being changed into black characters, you don't bat an eye. Unless

08:37.760 --> 08:42.160
they're doing blackface, of course, unless it's a white person wearing wearing blackface. That's

08:42.160 --> 08:46.160
different, even though it's still white going to black. I mean, here's the Sailor Moon argument

08:46.160 --> 08:50.640
again. There are thousands of bits of artwork where people take characters that are either

08:50.640 --> 08:55.520
white or Asian. I mean, it depends. It's anime, right? But white or Asian and make them very

08:55.520 --> 09:01.520
obviously not either of those things. No one cares. No one bats an eye. No one shrieks racism

09:01.520 --> 09:05.360
at this. But do it with Black Panther and oh shit, it's on. Because we're talking about the

09:05.360 --> 09:10.880
radical left here and because the radical left values only power as shown to us by their love

09:10.880 --> 09:16.640
of power politics as the ultimate descriptor and predictor of everything that they do as the lens

09:16.640 --> 09:21.680
through which they see the world. Blackface and brownface or whitewashing and blackwashing,

09:21.680 --> 09:26.000
depending on what we're talking about, all of that stuff is only bad depending on who has the

09:26.000 --> 09:31.760
power in the situation. So when someone who is white transforms into someone who is black,

09:31.760 --> 09:36.880
if it's done in a way to say mock black people, if it's done in a way where the white person has

09:36.880 --> 09:41.760
the power, then it's racist and it's terrible. But if it's done not to mock black people, but

09:41.760 --> 09:47.040
to erase white people, well, then it's fine. Even though you're still taking a white figure

09:47.040 --> 09:52.000
and making it black, it's actually OK in this instance because the black person has the power.

09:52.000 --> 09:57.840
This is why Nathan Grayson believes that Twitch has a racist emote problem because there are

09:57.840 --> 10:03.760
emotes of black people on Twitch and white people use them. That is, in essence, a white person

10:03.760 --> 10:08.560
presenting a black message. The whiteness is going to blackness. But because the white person

10:08.560 --> 10:14.400
has the power, that's the problem. That's why The Guardian thinks that it's digital blackface

10:14.400 --> 10:20.160
when black people reacting as part of memes online got so popular around last year or so,

10:20.160 --> 10:25.280
because it's not actually a black voice. There's no black power involved. It's simply,

10:25.280 --> 10:31.920
presumably, again, a white person using a black person's face, hence digital blackface.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.840
And if we're really going down the logic of cultural appropriation, if it is the case that

10:35.840 --> 10:41.360
a white person taking something from the domain of the black and using it for their own ends is

10:41.360 --> 10:45.760
blackface, even though a black person taking something from the domain of the white and using

10:45.760 --> 10:50.720
it for their own ends is empowering or something, then there's many more forms of blackface than

10:50.720 --> 10:55.360
what we thought, not just the digital blackface. How about mispronouncing names? You've got the

10:55.360 --> 11:02.480
three authors of this article, Kaya Roy, Zahira Ali and Medha Kumar. I probably mispronounced all

11:02.480 --> 11:08.400
of those, but I took their black name and I made it white with my mispronunciation. This is

11:08.400 --> 11:14.000
linguistic blackface in a sense. Or what about political blackface? Here's a white woman saying

11:14.000 --> 11:19.360
that black Twitter ain't having no Bernie. I mean, she would know, right? But then we come to the

11:19.360 --> 11:25.440
most insidious form of blackface of all, intellectual blackface. Diversity of thought is just a euphemism

11:25.440 --> 11:31.360
for white supremacy, a breakdown of why free thought actually translates to white thought.

11:31.360 --> 11:36.480
There's an epidemic out there of black people who are thinking white. And if they're thinking white,

11:37.040 --> 11:41.840
that means that it's white people who have the power parading around those black faces and black

11:41.840 --> 11:46.400
bodies inhabited with white thoughts. The angry black woman stereotype is making it damn near

11:46.400 --> 11:50.720
impossible for black women to get mental health care. Well, as far as I can see it, mental health

11:50.720 --> 11:54.480
care is probably a privilege, which means that you're going to be thinking white, which means

11:54.480 --> 11:58.720
that if you want it as a proud black woman, you're gonna have to think white to get it. And you have

11:58.720 --> 12:04.880
to understand, you need to stay in your lane. PSA Sitch recently linked on his Twitter account a

12:04.880 --> 12:11.440
very interesting study talking about just how many black people are inhabited by white thoughts.

12:11.440 --> 12:17.840
Because as it turns out, between 2006 and 2007, every 100 bachelor's degrees conferred on black

12:17.840 --> 12:24.000
men, 196 were conferred on black women. And as Sitch says, the SJW idea that black women are

12:24.000 --> 12:28.480
the most disenfranchised, thus deserve the most power in their movement, may be completely

12:28.480 --> 12:33.440
backwards. Oh, oh, are black women more on top than they thought? Well, it's because all of those

12:33.440 --> 12:38.800
offending black women who dare to excel, they're inhabited by white thoughts and their racism needs

12:38.800 --> 12:43.280
to be stopped. This whole attitude can basically be summed up by this headline. Liberals clarify

12:43.280 --> 12:48.160
they only want black voices to be heard when they're saying liberal things. But Dev, you may ask,

12:48.160 --> 12:52.880
that's from the Babylon Bee. It's a joke article. Yeah, but it's still the truth. Do you want to

12:52.880 --> 12:58.720
hear it from their own mouths? Here's a member of AOC's squad, Ayanna Pressley, saying basically

12:58.720 --> 13:03.200
the same thing that I've been saying this whole video. For whatever lived experience and identity

13:03.200 --> 13:09.920
that you represent, if you are not prepared to come to that table, and to represent that voice,

13:09.920 --> 13:17.040
don't come. Because we don't need any more brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice. We

13:17.040 --> 13:21.920
don't need black faces that don't want to be a black voice. We don't need Muslims that don't want

13:21.920 --> 13:30.160
to be a Muslim voice. We don't need queers that don't want to be a queer voice. So you see,

13:30.160 --> 13:35.200
it's not enough to just be a black person. You have to be a black person with black thoughts.

13:35.760 --> 13:40.080
If you're a black person with white thoughts, you're not welcome. You're not really black

13:40.080 --> 13:45.440
anymore. And you know what? This logic can be applied to anything, really. Anything that's

13:45.440 --> 13:51.600
not you is a face. Am I the only person fed up of drag shows, a parody of what a real woman is,

13:51.600 --> 13:56.000
like blackface? And really, you can't argue with this, can you? If the original definition of

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
blackface was basically a theater style where white people would dress up as caricatures of

14:02.000 --> 14:07.360
black people and look exaggerated and act exaggerated for comedic effect, then how does

14:07.360 --> 14:13.360
that not describe the relationship between drag queen shows and women? Really, at this point,

14:13.360 --> 14:18.160
with the way things have gone, with the way definitions have been stretched, any facsimile,

14:18.160 --> 14:25.120
any act, any bit of deception, it's all a face. I mean, any woman that you see wearing makeup,

14:25.680 --> 14:30.080
is she wearing like beautiful face or something because maybe she's not quite that good looking

14:30.080 --> 14:34.560
underneath? I don't know. However, like I said earlier, it's all about that power,

14:35.200 --> 14:39.920
which is why it can go one way from the privileged to the oppressed, but not the other.

14:39.920 --> 14:45.440
As the very helpful social justice YouTube channel NowThis News is going to teach us in

14:45.440 --> 14:50.800
The Myth of Blackwashing. From Liam Neeson in Batman Begins to Scarlett Johansson in Ghost in

14:50.800 --> 14:57.840
the Shell and, well, pretty much any US anime adaptation ever, whitewashing is when Hollywood

14:57.840 --> 15:02.400
takes a character who is a person of color in the source material and casts a white actor for

15:02.400 --> 15:06.480
the final portrayal we see on screen. Yeah, it took Hollywood a long time to actually accept

15:06.480 --> 15:10.880
people of color as people. I guess that's what happens when you're run by 1940s Democrats.

15:10.880 --> 15:14.320
What about when a white character is played by a person of color on screen?

15:14.960 --> 15:19.440
Representation might upset some people who can't accept popular comic book characters like

15:19.440 --> 15:24.800
Nick Fury, Johnny Storm, and Domino as people of color, but this thing some people call

15:24.800 --> 15:30.480
blackwashing is not a problem. It's not even a thing. But let's start with why whitewashing

15:30.480 --> 15:36.000
is so harmful. See, so blackwashing doesn't exist, but whitewashing does because it's all about

15:36.000 --> 15:40.800
representation. It's all about the direction of the flow of power. Taking a character that

15:40.800 --> 15:45.360
is a person of color and making them white? Well, you might as well be slapping on the blackface

15:45.360 --> 15:50.960
makeup yourself. But taking a white character and making them black? That's just balancing the

15:50.960 --> 15:55.840
scales. It's just punching up. And Zazie Beetz could do the same for Domino. I grew up watching

15:55.840 --> 16:00.480
Domino on Wolverine and the X-Men, where she's portrayed with comics-accurate pale blue skin

16:00.480 --> 16:05.680
and a black circle around her eye. Now she's a black woman with natural hair and her traditional

16:05.680 --> 16:10.960
look is still there right down to the eye tattoo. It's just inverted now. But see, that looks lazy.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.680
And it's not because she's black. It's because the original character was blue.

16:16.240 --> 16:19.840
Like, you could have taken this black actress and made her blue. Still have her played by a

16:19.840 --> 16:25.280
black woman, but the character is supposed to be blue, so make her blue. Or does blackness just

16:25.280 --> 16:31.840
not count if the character is not actually black, even though they're played by a black person? Oh

16:31.840 --> 16:36.000
wait, that's exactly the case! We're yet to see a black woman wield a lightsaber in a Star Wars

16:36.000 --> 16:41.600
movie! Well, I mean, there's this one. Does she not count because even though the actress is black,

16:41.600 --> 16:47.680
she's blue? Well, there's also this one. But does she not count because even though she's a black

16:47.680 --> 16:51.760
actress wielding a lightsaber, she has alien tentacles growing out of her head? But like I

16:51.760 --> 16:56.000
said, it's all about who has the power. And I guess more specifically, who that power would benefit,

16:56.000 --> 17:02.560
and how. When news outlets take black or brown criminals and make them look whiter or paler,

17:02.560 --> 17:08.240
no one complains then. No one screeches about white washing or white face or black representation

17:08.240 --> 17:13.120
or whatever the fuck. Because at the end of the day, black people and brown people have the

17:13.120 --> 17:19.600
privilege of face. They can do things, say things, and think things that if white people did it,

17:19.600 --> 17:24.480
would be racist. And the liberalistic, individualistic, democratic idea that black

17:24.480 --> 17:29.120
people be judged not by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character,

17:29.120 --> 17:33.200
well that might have sounded pretty good on paper about 60 or so years ago, but progressives have

17:33.200 --> 17:38.800
since discovered that asking them to do so is like asking them to think white. We know better now.

17:38.800 --> 17:43.440
You see, we understand that asking black people to be responsible moral agents

17:43.440 --> 17:46.560
is asking them to wear intellectual blackface.
