Hey everybody on Reddit, this is Dev from the ShortFatOtaku channel.

00:03.960 --> 00:08.460
We do anime reviews and let's plays, but today we've been chosen to judge this week's Unsuccy

00:08.460 --> 00:10.520
Sundae contest.

00:10.520 --> 00:15.200
CamryLady did most of the reviewing of this week's contestants, but because she's a socially

00:15.200 --> 00:17.400
impaired artist she passed the buck to me.

00:17.400 --> 00:22.080
Let's take a look at our winners, BadWeed with HappyFeet.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.760
The film, the end of it, it's sort of like, oh yeah, don't eat our fish, oh how are we

00:26.760 --> 00:31.920
going to purvey this to the human beings, and they're just like, we know.

00:31.920 --> 00:36.120
Some of the best let's plays come from some of the worst games, and riffing on a shitty

00:36.120 --> 00:40.480
game like HappyFeet is exactly as funny as I'd expect it to be.

00:40.480 --> 00:45.280
These two have a pretty good rhythm, and they're entertaining enough to keep an audience watching.

00:45.280 --> 00:49.640
The biggest reason this video isn't higher on the list is because the audio is extremely

00:49.640 --> 00:51.040
echoey.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.880
Investing in some hardware would take this show a long way.

00:54.880 --> 01:08.400
Super Spears Brothers with Diddy Kong Racing.

01:08.400 --> 01:13.440
The Super Spears Brothers are as close to a direct upgrade to BadWeed as you can get.

01:13.440 --> 01:17.760
They've got a similar style of humor, and a similar rhythm between the two hosts, but

01:17.760 --> 01:21.800
the Super Spears Brothers simply have more energy to their commentary.

01:21.800 --> 01:27.000
They're willing to be zanier, goofier, and funnier, which puts them at number 4.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.100
This show also suffers the same big problem that BadWeed does too.

01:31.100 --> 01:35.320
Some high quality microphones would remove the tinny, distorted sound quality the commentary

01:35.320 --> 01:36.800
track has.

01:36.800 --> 01:57.000
Deadbeat Thespians with Skyrim.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.800
So far, it seems like each group is a direct improvement over the previous group.

02:01.800 --> 02:07.520
Deadbeat Thespians has the same feel as BadWeed and the Super Spears Brothers, but are sort

02:07.520 --> 02:09.660
of the best of both of them.

02:09.660 --> 02:14.280
They have the voices and the humor of the Super Spears Brothers, but they have the direction

02:14.280 --> 02:17.040
and the commentary control of BadWeed.

02:17.040 --> 02:22.320
Furthermore, their audio is a step up from both of them, but is still a little bit echoey.

02:22.320 --> 02:27.320
It sounds like they've got good microphones, and if they do, it's likely a matter of mic

02:27.320 --> 02:28.900
placement or software.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.220
An easy fix.

02:30.220 --> 02:32.260
Becky Meghan with Frostcraft.

03:00.220 --> 03:14.020
I don't like Minecraft.

03:14.020 --> 03:19.080
Nobody over here on this channel likes Minecraft, and despite that, this Minecraft video was

03:19.080 --> 03:21.080
good enough to be chosen.

03:21.080 --> 03:26.180
The commentator has a lot of energy, a wide variety of voices and accents, and passion

03:26.180 --> 03:28.260
for the topic at hand.

03:28.260 --> 03:33.000
She has the uncommon ability to keep a constant commentary rolling by herself, while still

03:33.000 --> 03:36.960
being entertaining and informative, and that's highly impressive.

03:36.960 --> 03:42.500
The only real critique I have to offer is that her voice track has a bit too much treble,

03:42.500 --> 03:45.720
causing higher notes to sound slightly distorted.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.960
Montadrical with Burial at Sea.

03:48.960 --> 03:56.080
We're on our way to get a new plasmid, the old man winter plasmid, is what we've been

03:56.080 --> 03:57.080
reading.

03:57.080 --> 04:19.500
This is the best video posted this week.

04:19.500 --> 04:24.400
It's yet another two-person commentary video, but this is the most polished of the bunch.

04:24.400 --> 04:29.600
The co-hosts bounce off each other well, and there's almost never a gap in the commentary.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.880
They're funny, but they aren't try-hard zany.

04:32.880 --> 04:38.000
They're informative, but not so stuck up on one topic of conversation that the video suffers

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
for.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.860
They've got the perfect balance of entertainment and structure.

04:42.860 --> 04:48.300
One person's mic is perfect, but the other's has the opposite problem of Becky Meghan's,

04:48.300 --> 04:52.640
having a bit too much bass, causing the lowest notes to bottom out.

04:53.640 --> 05:00.000
Atomic Dan's How To Gmod Tower video was really funny, but not a let's play.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.040
It's a great skit video though, and I really laughed at it.

05:03.040 --> 05:08.360
Similarly, Gaming Wildlife's Just Cause 2 video is not really a let's play, more like

05:08.360 --> 05:14.040
a short clip showing off a specific glitch or bug in the game, but it's also very funny.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.780
Even though these two aren't let's plays, they're still really worth watching.

05:17.780 --> 05:22.240
The people who didn't win this time around all had one of two problems.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.240
Some people had both problems.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.500
The first is audio quality.

05:26.500 --> 05:31.260
In a let's play, the quality of your microphone recording is essential.

05:31.260 --> 05:35.880
Even the winners had minor problems, but a lot of people had fuzzy audio, audio with

05:35.880 --> 05:42.440
background noise, sneezes or burps left in, muffled audio, echoed audio, you name it,

05:42.440 --> 05:43.840
somebody had it.

05:43.840 --> 05:48.040
If you didn't win, take a good hard look at your quality and see what you can do to improve

05:48.040 --> 05:49.200
it.

05:49.200 --> 05:52.780
For a lot of people, that might just boil down to buying a better microphone, which

05:52.780 --> 05:56.120
I know can suck, but there's no other way around it.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.840
The second problem is gaps in commentary.

05:59.840 --> 06:04.120
I know it's a game, I know during an intense part, you feel the need to stop commentating

06:04.120 --> 06:08.640
and focus on getting through, but that doesn't make for an entertaining video.

06:08.640 --> 06:13.960
One guy in particular, Hi I Can't PK with his Mass Effect 3 video, would have likely

06:13.960 --> 06:18.540
won had he not paused for lengths of time during firefights.

06:18.540 --> 06:22.340
If you've got more than a second of dead air, you're not keeping a roll in commentary

06:22.340 --> 06:25.060
and not making a captivating video.

06:25.060 --> 06:28.620
Of course that doesn't mean you should be making random noises either, it's really a

06:28.620 --> 06:33.580
skill you have to learn, talking constantly while still staying on topic.

06:33.580 --> 06:38.560
Or alternatively, you could simply edit your let's plays like we do on our channel.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.980
These were the biggest two problems, but there were a number of others too.

06:41.980 --> 06:47.680
If an intro is longer than 10 seconds, it's too long, and unless it's really slick, 10

06:47.680 --> 06:49.320
seconds is pushing it.

06:49.320 --> 06:53.900
An outro should not overlap with the tail end of a video, especially when stuff is happening

06:53.900 --> 06:56.180
during the tail end.

06:56.180 --> 07:00.540
If you're in a game with no voice acting, and not much in the way of dialogue, there's

07:00.540 --> 07:04.700
no reason not to voice act the few NPCs you come across.

07:04.700 --> 07:09.480
Just little things like that, if done would give your video polish, and if left undone,

07:09.480 --> 07:10.880
build up over time.

07:10.880 --> 07:14.400
Anyway, that's your Unsucky Sunday for this week.

07:14.400 --> 07:19.160
Camera ladies asked that Becky Meghan do next week's Unsucky Sunday, but she might

07:19.160 --> 07:23.040
also be a little bit biased in her opinion there.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.880
Have fun everybody, if you haven't checked out our videos yet, what are you waiting for?
