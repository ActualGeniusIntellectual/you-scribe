00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Hey everybody on Reddit, this is Dev from the ShortFatOtaku channel.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,460
We do anime reviews and let's plays, but today we've been chosen to judge this week's Unsuccy

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,520
Sundae contest.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,200
CamryLady did most of the reviewing of this week's contestants, but because she's a socially

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,400
impaired artist she passed the buck to me.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,080
Let's take a look at our winners, BadWeed with HappyFeet.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,760
The film, the end of it, it's sort of like, oh yeah, don't eat our fish, oh how are we

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,920
going to purvey this to the human beings, and they're just like, we know.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,120
Some of the best let's plays come from some of the worst games, and riffing on a shitty

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,480
game like HappyFeet is exactly as funny as I'd expect it to be.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,280
These two have a pretty good rhythm, and they're entertaining enough to keep an audience watching.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,640
The biggest reason this video isn't higher on the list is because the audio is extremely

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,040
echoey.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,880
Investing in some hardware would take this show a long way.

15
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:08,400
Super Spears Brothers with Diddy Kong Racing.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,440
The Super Spears Brothers are as close to a direct upgrade to BadWeed as you can get.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,760
They've got a similar style of humor, and a similar rhythm between the two hosts, but

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,800
the Super Spears Brothers simply have more energy to their commentary.

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,000
They're willing to be zanier, goofier, and funnier, which puts them at number 4.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,100
This show also suffers the same big problem that BadWeed does too.

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,320
Some high quality microphones would remove the tinny, distorted sound quality the commentary

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,800
track has.

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Deadbeat Thespians with Skyrim.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,800
So far, it seems like each group is a direct improvement over the previous group.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,520
Deadbeat Thespians has the same feel as BadWeed and the Super Spears Brothers, but are sort

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,660
of the best of both of them.

27
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,280
They have the voices and the humor of the Super Spears Brothers, but they have the direction

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,040
and the commentary control of BadWeed.

29
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,320
Furthermore, their audio is a step up from both of them, but is still a little bit echoey.

30
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,320
It sounds like they've got good microphones, and if they do, it's likely a matter of mic

31
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,900
placement or software.

32
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,220
An easy fix.

33
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,260
Becky Meghan with Frostcraft.

34
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:14,020
I don't like Minecraft.

35
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,080
Nobody over here on this channel likes Minecraft, and despite that, this Minecraft video was

36
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
good enough to be chosen.

37
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,180
The commentator has a lot of energy, a wide variety of voices and accents, and passion

38
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,260
for the topic at hand.

39
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,000
She has the uncommon ability to keep a constant commentary rolling by herself, while still

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,960
being entertaining and informative, and that's highly impressive.

41
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,500
The only real critique I have to offer is that her voice track has a bit too much treble,

42
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,720
causing higher notes to sound slightly distorted.

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,960
Montadrical with Burial at Sea.

44
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:56,080
We're on our way to get a new plasmid, the old man winter plasmid, is what we've been

45
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
reading.

46
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:19,500
This is the best video posted this week.

47
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,400
It's yet another two-person commentary video, but this is the most polished of the bunch.

48
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,600
The co-hosts bounce off each other well, and there's almost never a gap in the commentary.

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,880
They're funny, but they aren't try-hard zany.

50
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,000
They're informative, but not so stuck up on one topic of conversation that the video suffers

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
for.

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,860
They've got the perfect balance of entertainment and structure.

53
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,300
One person's mic is perfect, but the other's has the opposite problem of Becky Meghan's,

54
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,640
having a bit too much bass, causing the lowest notes to bottom out.

55
00:04:53,640 --> 00:05:00,000
Atomic Dan's How To Gmod Tower video was really funny, but not a let's play.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,040
It's a great skit video though, and I really laughed at it.

57
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,360
Similarly, Gaming Wildlife's Just Cause 2 video is not really a let's play, more like

58
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,040
a short clip showing off a specific glitch or bug in the game, but it's also very funny.

59
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,780
Even though these two aren't let's plays, they're still really worth watching.

60
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,240
The people who didn't win this time around all had one of two problems.

61
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Some people had both problems.

62
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,500
The first is audio quality.

63
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,260
In a let's play, the quality of your microphone recording is essential.

64
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,880
Even the winners had minor problems, but a lot of people had fuzzy audio, audio with

65
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,440
background noise, sneezes or burps left in, muffled audio, echoed audio, you name it,

66
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,840
somebody had it.

67
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,040
If you didn't win, take a good hard look at your quality and see what you can do to improve

68
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,200
it.

69
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,780
For a lot of people, that might just boil down to buying a better microphone, which

70
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,120
I know can suck, but there's no other way around it.

71
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,840
The second problem is gaps in commentary.

72
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,120
I know it's a game, I know during an intense part, you feel the need to stop commentating

73
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,640
and focus on getting through, but that doesn't make for an entertaining video.

74
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,960
One guy in particular, Hi I Can't PK with his Mass Effect 3 video, would have likely

75
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,540
won had he not paused for lengths of time during firefights.

76
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,340
If you've got more than a second of dead air, you're not keeping a roll in commentary

77
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,060
and not making a captivating video.

78
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,620
Of course that doesn't mean you should be making random noises either, it's really a

79
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,580
skill you have to learn, talking constantly while still staying on topic.

80
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,560
Or alternatively, you could simply edit your let's plays like we do on our channel.

81
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,980
These were the biggest two problems, but there were a number of others too.

82
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,680
If an intro is longer than 10 seconds, it's too long, and unless it's really slick, 10

83
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,320
seconds is pushing it.

84
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,900
An outro should not overlap with the tail end of a video, especially when stuff is happening

85
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,180
during the tail end.

86
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,540
If you're in a game with no voice acting, and not much in the way of dialogue, there's

87
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,700
no reason not to voice act the few NPCs you come across.

88
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,480
Just little things like that, if done would give your video polish, and if left undone,

89
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,880
build up over time.

90
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,400
Anyway, that's your Unsucky Sunday for this week.

91
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,160
Camera ladies asked that Becky Meghan do next week's Unsucky Sunday, but she might

92
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,040
also be a little bit biased in her opinion there.

93
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,880
Have fun everybody, if you haven't checked out our videos yet, what are you waiting for?
