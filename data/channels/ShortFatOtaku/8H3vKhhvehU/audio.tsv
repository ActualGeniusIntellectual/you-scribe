0	3960	Hey everybody on Reddit, this is Dev from the ShortFatOtaku channel.
3960	8460	We do anime reviews and let's plays, but today we've been chosen to judge this week's Unsuccy
8460	10520	Sundae contest.
10520	15200	CamryLady did most of the reviewing of this week's contestants, but because she's a socially
15200	17400	impaired artist she passed the buck to me.
17400	22080	Let's take a look at our winners, BadWeed with HappyFeet.
22080	26760	The film, the end of it, it's sort of like, oh yeah, don't eat our fish, oh how are we
26760	31920	going to purvey this to the human beings, and they're just like, we know.
31920	36120	Some of the best let's plays come from some of the worst games, and riffing on a shitty
36120	40480	game like HappyFeet is exactly as funny as I'd expect it to be.
40480	45280	These two have a pretty good rhythm, and they're entertaining enough to keep an audience watching.
45280	49640	The biggest reason this video isn't higher on the list is because the audio is extremely
49640	51040	echoey.
51040	54880	Investing in some hardware would take this show a long way.
54880	68400	Super Spears Brothers with Diddy Kong Racing.
68400	73440	The Super Spears Brothers are as close to a direct upgrade to BadWeed as you can get.
73440	77760	They've got a similar style of humor, and a similar rhythm between the two hosts, but
77760	81800	the Super Spears Brothers simply have more energy to their commentary.
81800	87000	They're willing to be zanier, goofier, and funnier, which puts them at number 4.
87000	91100	This show also suffers the same big problem that BadWeed does too.
91100	95320	Some high quality microphones would remove the tinny, distorted sound quality the commentary
95320	96800	track has.
96800	117000	Deadbeat Thespians with Skyrim.
117000	121800	So far, it seems like each group is a direct improvement over the previous group.
121800	127520	Deadbeat Thespians has the same feel as BadWeed and the Super Spears Brothers, but are sort
127520	129660	of the best of both of them.
129660	134280	They have the voices and the humor of the Super Spears Brothers, but they have the direction
134280	137040	and the commentary control of BadWeed.
137040	142320	Furthermore, their audio is a step up from both of them, but is still a little bit echoey.
142320	147320	It sounds like they've got good microphones, and if they do, it's likely a matter of mic
147320	148900	placement or software.
148900	150220	An easy fix.
150220	152260	Becky Meghan with Frostcraft.
180220	194020	I don't like Minecraft.
194020	199080	Nobody over here on this channel likes Minecraft, and despite that, this Minecraft video was
199080	201080	good enough to be chosen.
201080	206180	The commentator has a lot of energy, a wide variety of voices and accents, and passion
206180	208260	for the topic at hand.
208260	213000	She has the uncommon ability to keep a constant commentary rolling by herself, while still
213000	216960	being entertaining and informative, and that's highly impressive.
216960	222500	The only real critique I have to offer is that her voice track has a bit too much treble,
222500	225720	causing higher notes to sound slightly distorted.
225720	228960	Montadrical with Burial at Sea.
228960	236080	We're on our way to get a new plasmid, the old man winter plasmid, is what we've been
236080	237080	reading.
237080	259500	This is the best video posted this week.
259500	264400	It's yet another two-person commentary video, but this is the most polished of the bunch.
264400	269600	The co-hosts bounce off each other well, and there's almost never a gap in the commentary.
269600	272880	They're funny, but they aren't try-hard zany.
272880	278000	They're informative, but not so stuck up on one topic of conversation that the video suffers
278000	279000	for.
279000	282860	They've got the perfect balance of entertainment and structure.
282860	288300	One person's mic is perfect, but the other's has the opposite problem of Becky Meghan's,
288300	292640	having a bit too much bass, causing the lowest notes to bottom out.
293640	300000	Atomic Dan's How To Gmod Tower video was really funny, but not a let's play.
300000	303040	It's a great skit video though, and I really laughed at it.
303040	308360	Similarly, Gaming Wildlife's Just Cause 2 video is not really a let's play, more like
308360	314040	a short clip showing off a specific glitch or bug in the game, but it's also very funny.
314040	317780	Even though these two aren't let's plays, they're still really worth watching.
317780	322240	The people who didn't win this time around all had one of two problems.
322240	324240	Some people had both problems.
324240	326500	The first is audio quality.
326500	331260	In a let's play, the quality of your microphone recording is essential.
331260	335880	Even the winners had minor problems, but a lot of people had fuzzy audio, audio with
335880	342440	background noise, sneezes or burps left in, muffled audio, echoed audio, you name it,
342440	343840	somebody had it.
343840	348040	If you didn't win, take a good hard look at your quality and see what you can do to improve
348040	349200	it.
349200	352780	For a lot of people, that might just boil down to buying a better microphone, which
352780	356120	I know can suck, but there's no other way around it.
356120	359840	The second problem is gaps in commentary.
359840	364120	I know it's a game, I know during an intense part, you feel the need to stop commentating
364120	368640	and focus on getting through, but that doesn't make for an entertaining video.
368640	373960	One guy in particular, Hi I Can't PK with his Mass Effect 3 video, would have likely
373960	378540	won had he not paused for lengths of time during firefights.
378540	382340	If you've got more than a second of dead air, you're not keeping a roll in commentary
382340	385060	and not making a captivating video.
385060	388620	Of course that doesn't mean you should be making random noises either, it's really a
388620	393580	skill you have to learn, talking constantly while still staying on topic.
393580	398560	Or alternatively, you could simply edit your let's plays like we do on our channel.
398560	401980	These were the biggest two problems, but there were a number of others too.
401980	407680	If an intro is longer than 10 seconds, it's too long, and unless it's really slick, 10
407680	409320	seconds is pushing it.
409320	413900	An outro should not overlap with the tail end of a video, especially when stuff is happening
413900	416180	during the tail end.
416180	420540	If you're in a game with no voice acting, and not much in the way of dialogue, there's
420540	424700	no reason not to voice act the few NPCs you come across.
424700	429480	Just little things like that, if done would give your video polish, and if left undone,
429480	430880	build up over time.
430880	434400	Anyway, that's your Unsucky Sunday for this week.
434400	439160	Camera ladies asked that Becky Meghan do next week's Unsucky Sunday, but she might
439160	443040	also be a little bit biased in her opinion there.
443040	446880	Have fun everybody, if you haven't checked out our videos yet, what are you waiting for?
