00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
So yesterday's video was titled, Black Lives Matter is a Racegrift.

00:04.640 --> 00:06.340
Here it is, it's been removed.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.820
This video was removed from YouTube, only you can see this video.

00:09.820 --> 00:12.240
This video can't be monetized.

00:12.240 --> 00:15.560
This video has been removed for inappropriate content.

00:15.560 --> 00:20.480
Now, this video showed some of the violence that Black Lives Matter people have been committing

00:20.480 --> 00:25.440
in the streets, but the video also shows how Black Lives Matter has its roots in Marxism,

00:25.440 --> 00:29.900
as well as how it takes all of those millions of dollars of donations given to various Black

00:29.900 --> 00:34.440
Lives Matter groups, and then funnels them to the Democratic Party through a slush fund

00:34.440 --> 00:36.140
known as ActBlue.

00:36.140 --> 00:41.020
There was some violence in the video, but it was on par with my previous two videos,

00:41.020 --> 00:45.460
the police violence from the Legitimate Police Reformers Needed, and the Antifa violence

00:45.460 --> 00:48.340
from my Antifa is a Terrorist Organization video.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.200
Now those videos got demonetized, and I expected they would.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.220
I did not expect my Black Lives Matter video to be taken down.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.360
Maybe it is because of the violence, or maybe it's because they don't want any kind of criticism

00:57.360 --> 00:58.360
of BLM to get out there.

00:58.880 --> 01:02.120
This is what it looks like in my back end, I can't do anything really, I can't change

01:02.120 --> 01:03.120
anything.

01:03.120 --> 01:07.540
And when you go to the actual video, at least for me, I see the video, but it says we've

01:07.540 --> 01:10.440
removed this video because it violates our community guidelines.

01:10.440 --> 01:13.480
You will be able to view this video for 7 days from when it was removed.

01:13.480 --> 01:17.760
This period allows you to review the content and decide whether you wish to submit an appeal.

01:17.760 --> 01:23.160
So if I click on the appeal this decision button, this is what I get.

01:23.160 --> 01:27.360
Before you appeal, please review your content to ensure that it abides by our community

01:27.360 --> 01:31.280
guidelines, in particular the section shown below.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.640
Provide supporting details in the box.

01:32.640 --> 01:35.160
Okay, well let's see what this section says.

01:35.160 --> 01:39.760
Upon review, we've determined that your content violates our guidelines and we've removed

01:39.760 --> 01:40.960
it from YouTube.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.820
We know that this might be disappointing, but it's important to us that YouTube is a

01:43.820 --> 01:45.400
safe place for all.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.820
If content breaks our rules, we remove it.

01:48.820 --> 01:53.480
Learn more, by the way, will just take us to the basic community guidelines page.

01:53.480 --> 02:00.220
So even though it says this particular section was what I violated, this says nothing.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.560
This is literally just a fuck you.

02:02.560 --> 02:08.200
You haven't explained how my video violated your guidelines and nothing in it breaks your

02:08.200 --> 02:09.640
terms of service.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.640
To be honest, I don't expect anything back out of that.

02:11.640 --> 02:17.120
I think that video is just going to have to remain off my channel, unfortunately.

02:17.120 --> 02:20.820
It is of course on my Bitchute, it's right here.

02:20.820 --> 02:23.260
If you feel like going to watch it there, here it is.

02:23.260 --> 02:33.780
And one of my friends has decided to upload a backup to their channel as well.

02:33.780 --> 02:36.680
If you want to do the same, you know, put it on your own channel as a backup, feel free

02:36.680 --> 02:40.420
to download it from one of these sources and re-upload, I don't mind.

02:40.420 --> 02:42.460
Anyway, fuck censorship and fuck YouTube.
