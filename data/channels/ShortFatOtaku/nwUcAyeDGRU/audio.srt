00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
So yesterday's video was titled, Black Lives Matter is a Racegrift.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,340
Here it is, it's been removed.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,820
This video was removed from YouTube, only you can see this video.

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,240
This video can't be monetized.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,560
This video has been removed for inappropriate content.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,480
Now, this video showed some of the violence that Black Lives Matter people have been committing

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,440
in the streets, but the video also shows how Black Lives Matter has its roots in Marxism,

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,900
as well as how it takes all of those millions of dollars of donations given to various Black

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,440
Lives Matter groups, and then funnels them to the Democratic Party through a slush fund

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,140
known as ActBlue.

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,020
There was some violence in the video, but it was on par with my previous two videos,

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:45,460
the police violence from the Legitimate Police Reformers Needed, and the Antifa violence

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,340
from my Antifa is a Terrorist Organization video.

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,200
Now those videos got demonetized, and I expected they would.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,220
I did not expect my Black Lives Matter video to be taken down.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,360
Maybe it is because of the violence, or maybe it's because they don't want any kind of criticism

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
of BLM to get out there.

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,120
This is what it looks like in my back end, I can't do anything really, I can't change

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
anything.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,540
And when you go to the actual video, at least for me, I see the video, but it says we've

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,440
removed this video because it violates our community guidelines.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,480
You will be able to view this video for 7 days from when it was removed.

23
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,760
This period allows you to review the content and decide whether you wish to submit an appeal.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,160
So if I click on the appeal this decision button, this is what I get.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,360
Before you appeal, please review your content to ensure that it abides by our community

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,280
guidelines, in particular the section shown below.

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,640
Provide supporting details in the box.

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,160
Okay, well let's see what this section says.

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,760
Upon review, we've determined that your content violates our guidelines and we've removed

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,960
it from YouTube.

31
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,820
We know that this might be disappointing, but it's important to us that YouTube is a

32
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,400
safe place for all.

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,820
If content breaks our rules, we remove it.

34
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,480
Learn more, by the way, will just take us to the basic community guidelines page.

35
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:00,220
So even though it says this particular section was what I violated, this says nothing.

36
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,560
This is literally just a fuck you.

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,200
You haven't explained how my video violated your guidelines and nothing in it breaks your

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,640
terms of service.

39
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,640
To be honest, I don't expect anything back out of that.

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,120
I think that video is just going to have to remain off my channel, unfortunately.

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,820
It is of course on my Bitchute, it's right here.

42
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,260
If you feel like going to watch it there, here it is.

43
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:33,780
And one of my friends has decided to upload a backup to their channel as well.

44
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,680
If you want to do the same, you know, put it on your own channel as a backup, feel free

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,420
to download it from one of these sources and re-upload, I don't mind.

46
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,460
Anyway, fuck censorship and fuck YouTube.
