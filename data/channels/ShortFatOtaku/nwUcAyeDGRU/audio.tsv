0	4640	So yesterday's video was titled, Black Lives Matter is a Racegrift.
4640	6340	Here it is, it's been removed.
6340	9820	This video was removed from YouTube, only you can see this video.
9820	12240	This video can't be monetized.
12240	15560	This video has been removed for inappropriate content.
15560	20480	Now, this video showed some of the violence that Black Lives Matter people have been committing
20480	25440	in the streets, but the video also shows how Black Lives Matter has its roots in Marxism,
25440	29900	as well as how it takes all of those millions of dollars of donations given to various Black
29900	34440	Lives Matter groups, and then funnels them to the Democratic Party through a slush fund
34440	36140	known as ActBlue.
36140	41020	There was some violence in the video, but it was on par with my previous two videos,
41020	45460	the police violence from the Legitimate Police Reformers Needed, and the Antifa violence
45460	48340	from my Antifa is a Terrorist Organization video.
48340	51200	Now those videos got demonetized, and I expected they would.
51200	54220	I did not expect my Black Lives Matter video to be taken down.
54220	57360	Maybe it is because of the violence, or maybe it's because they don't want any kind of criticism
57360	58360	of BLM to get out there.
58880	62120	This is what it looks like in my back end, I can't do anything really, I can't change
62120	63120	anything.
63120	67540	And when you go to the actual video, at least for me, I see the video, but it says we've
67540	70440	removed this video because it violates our community guidelines.
70440	73480	You will be able to view this video for 7 days from when it was removed.
73480	77760	This period allows you to review the content and decide whether you wish to submit an appeal.
77760	83160	So if I click on the appeal this decision button, this is what I get.
83160	87360	Before you appeal, please review your content to ensure that it abides by our community
87360	91280	guidelines, in particular the section shown below.
91280	92640	Provide supporting details in the box.
92640	95160	Okay, well let's see what this section says.
95160	99760	Upon review, we've determined that your content violates our guidelines and we've removed
99760	100960	it from YouTube.
100960	103820	We know that this might be disappointing, but it's important to us that YouTube is a
103820	105400	safe place for all.
105400	108820	If content breaks our rules, we remove it.
108820	113480	Learn more, by the way, will just take us to the basic community guidelines page.
113480	120220	So even though it says this particular section was what I violated, this says nothing.
120220	122560	This is literally just a fuck you.
122560	128200	You haven't explained how my video violated your guidelines and nothing in it breaks your
128200	129640	terms of service.
129640	131640	To be honest, I don't expect anything back out of that.
131640	137120	I think that video is just going to have to remain off my channel, unfortunately.
137120	140820	It is of course on my Bitchute, it's right here.
140820	143260	If you feel like going to watch it there, here it is.
143260	153780	And one of my friends has decided to upload a backup to their channel as well.
153780	156680	If you want to do the same, you know, put it on your own channel as a backup, feel free
156680	160420	to download it from one of these sources and re-upload, I don't mind.
160420	162460	Anyway, fuck censorship and fuck YouTube.
