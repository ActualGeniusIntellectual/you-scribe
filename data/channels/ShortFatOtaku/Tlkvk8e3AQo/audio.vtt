00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
Here's a video you might not want to watch, but I do think it's important.

00:03.840 --> 00:10.240
When is the radical left actually right? I don't mean right-leaning, I mean correct.

00:10.240 --> 00:14.320
What have they got properly pegged? What can we learn from them?

00:14.320 --> 00:19.360
Even though they're often just a bunch of clowns who have no idea how the real world works,

00:19.360 --> 00:25.280
they also regularly have important and powerful insights and we would do well not to ignore them.

00:25.280 --> 00:28.240
This video might be the one that actually gets me cancelled by my own audience,

00:28.240 --> 00:32.240
but I do believe it to be the truth, so I don't care, no offense guys.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.080
Come into this with an open mind, alright?

00:34.080 --> 00:40.000
Firstly, intersectionality is correct. For those of you who don't know, intersectional theory

00:40.000 --> 00:45.040
is the idea that you have privilege or oppression based on your various characteristics,

00:45.040 --> 00:48.880
and that each individual characteristic intersects to form a new identity.

00:48.880 --> 00:53.200
It was described to me by my gender studies professors as being the bars of a cage,

00:53.200 --> 00:58.000
where one bar is your sex, another bar is your race, another bar is your ethnicity,

00:58.000 --> 01:02.400
your nationality, your gender identity, your sexual orientation, etc etc.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.920
And that while one individual bar may not be oppressive,

01:05.920 --> 01:09.360
when they're all summed up they form the thing that entraps you.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.520
They often like to use an image like this that kind of describes the theory,

01:13.520 --> 01:16.400
where each of these various characteristics overlap,

01:16.400 --> 01:20.080
and the more overlapping that happens where you are, the more oppressed you are.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.560
This is where you get the idea of the progressive stack, or the oppression olympics,

01:24.560 --> 01:29.360
where a black man might be oppressed but he's not as oppressed as a black gay woman,

01:29.360 --> 01:30.720
or something along those lines.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.680
The problem with this image is that this phenomenon functions

01:33.680 --> 01:36.640
less like a Venn diagram and more like a chart,

01:36.640 --> 01:41.680
an ever expanding chart where every single identity can be multiplied by every single

01:41.680 --> 01:45.680
other identity. You have to fractionate race with gender, okay?

01:45.680 --> 01:48.320
Let's say you have two genders, male and female,

01:48.320 --> 01:52.000
let's say you have three races, white, black, Asian.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.960
I know this is very oversimplified but just just hear me out.

01:54.960 --> 01:58.800
That means that you have six fractionations, the three races multiplied by the two genders.

01:58.800 --> 02:03.120
But now you have to add in all the other genders that the radical left insists exists.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.880
You also have to add in all the other races, so suddenly you have many different identities.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.800
And we haven't even gotten to sexual orientation yet, or gender identity, or ethnicity,

02:10.800 --> 02:14.960
nationality, disability, class, or socioeconomic status.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.960
And when we talk about those things, are we just going to talk about their income?

02:18.960 --> 02:21.840
Or is there more to it than that? How about debt?

02:21.840 --> 02:26.320
The problem with intersectional theory is, despite being technically correct,

02:26.320 --> 02:30.320
it is a completely unworkable theory in practice because there are simply

02:30.320 --> 02:32.320
too many identities to fractionate.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.720
Again, that's where you get the Oppression Olympics.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.200
I mean, how do we determine who has it worse?

02:37.200 --> 02:39.600
One person says I'm a gay male.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.760
One person says I'm a gay female.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.160
One person says I'm a black gay female.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.920
I'm a black gay female who's trapped in an abusive relationship.

02:47.920 --> 02:53.440
I'm a bisexual trans Latina illegal immigrant who just got diagnosed with cancer,

02:53.440 --> 02:56.800
and who has a child who should be going to one of the best schools in the country

02:56.800 --> 02:59.600
because he has a phenomenal IQ, but I just can't afford it.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.480
You know, all these situations suck in their own way.

03:02.480 --> 03:06.400
Everyone has something that makes them oppressed, even the straight white males.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.640
So how do you figure out who's more oppressed?

03:08.640 --> 03:11.600
And most importantly of all, who gets to decide?

03:11.600 --> 03:16.400
Who will be the arbiter of who is the most oppressed and therefore should have

03:16.400 --> 03:18.720
more resources allocated to them by the state?

03:18.720 --> 03:22.160
Because reparations are one of the long-term goals of the intersectionalists.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.560
So the person who gets to decide how oppressed you are,

03:24.560 --> 03:26.640
that's not some minor point in the conversation.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.840
That is the linchpin.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.200
Who gets to decide?

03:29.200 --> 03:31.280
How do you know that they're being accurate?

03:31.280 --> 03:33.200
How do you know they're being impartial?

03:33.200 --> 03:34.800
How do you know they're not corrupt?

03:34.800 --> 03:37.600
Their power would have to basically be everywhere.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.480
They'd have to have tendrils in every single aspect of society

03:40.480 --> 03:42.000
in order to properly do this.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.960
How does this system not instantly devolve into a tyranny?

03:44.960 --> 03:47.600
I mean, at least with capitalism.

03:47.600 --> 03:51.440
And this we're talking about extreme disparities between like the ultra rich,

03:51.440 --> 03:54.880
the 1% of the 1% and people who are like homeless or something.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.680
But in most cases within capitalism,

03:57.680 --> 04:00.320
all this stuff is rolled up into the price that you pay.

04:00.320 --> 04:05.680
You know, you've got poor, oppressed, victimized you with all of your problems

04:05.680 --> 04:06.880
and you might need something.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.960
So you go out to a store and you go to buy it.

04:08.960 --> 04:14.000
And then the shopkeeper who has all of his poor oppressions and victimizations,

04:14.000 --> 04:17.520
things that you don't see because you're only interacting with him for a few seconds,

04:17.520 --> 04:19.600
he's willing to sell you something for a price.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.920
And all of his oppression is packed into his price

04:21.920 --> 04:25.280
and all of your oppression is packed into the amount that you're willing to pay for it.

04:25.280 --> 04:28.400
And sometimes you can negotiate, sometimes you can cut a deal,

04:28.400 --> 04:30.480
sometimes you can just go look elsewhere.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.880
But at the very least with capitalism,

04:32.880 --> 04:36.720
there is some kind of understanding that yes, we're all in this together,

04:36.720 --> 04:38.880
but that also means that you have to pay your own way.

04:39.360 --> 04:40.480
They got to eat too.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.720
They will give you something that will improve your life

04:42.720 --> 04:46.000
and you have to give something that will improve their life in turn.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.960
And generally what that thing is, is what they buy with your money.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.320
And in doing it this way, you avoid the problem of intersectionality.

04:52.320 --> 04:56.160
You no longer need to take the millions of possible identities into account

04:56.160 --> 04:59.120
because those millions of possible identities,

04:59.120 --> 05:01.360
all of those ways in which you can be oppressed,

05:01.360 --> 05:05.760
that is the fatal flaw in my opinion of the intersectional theory.

05:05.760 --> 05:10.320
The leftist argument against this is that not all identities are equally valid.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.200
I mean, they will say to you in general that all identities are valid,

05:13.200 --> 05:17.680
but there are very clearly some they do not put inside intersectional theory.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.560
For example, you have that meme floating around right now

05:20.560 --> 05:23.360
that gamers are the most oppressed minority.

05:23.360 --> 05:27.600
You know, we live in a society, bottom text, that kind of stuff.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.280
But it does technically fit within intersectional theory.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.200
They really don't like it, but it does.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.120
Being a gamer or not being a gamer is a characteristic about yourself.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.280
And if you come from my generation,

05:39.280 --> 05:42.240
a generation where almost nobody played video games,

05:42.240 --> 05:44.640
yeah, you got bullied at school if you played them.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.720
Of course, it's not just gamers.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.680
Any identifiable characteristic about yourself

05:49.680 --> 05:54.000
that anybody for any reason has at some point disparaged you for,

05:54.640 --> 05:56.080
you could claim as oppression.

05:56.080 --> 06:01.360
That opens the door for you to be oppressed by quite literally anything about you.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.960
But it fits with the theory.

06:02.960 --> 06:06.160
Therefore, the meme gamers are the most oppressed minority

06:06.160 --> 06:09.120
is not poking fun at the idea that gamers think that they're oppressed

06:09.120 --> 06:10.560
just because they got bullied in school.

06:10.560 --> 06:16.080
It's poking fun at how nonsensical the entirety of intersectional theory is.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.600
But that is politically inconvenient.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.880
So intersectionalists do say that only some parts of your identity

06:20.880 --> 06:22.720
actually matter when it comes to intersectionality,

06:22.720 --> 06:25.680
but they never really make it clear where the line is drawn.

06:25.680 --> 06:28.480
You think that it would be drawn at immutable characteristics.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.800
So for example, you can't change your physical sex,

06:30.800 --> 06:33.200
although trans activists are really pushing that right now.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.800
You certainly can't change your race.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.960
There seems to be very little evidence in the way

06:36.960 --> 06:40.000
of being able to change your sexual orientation.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.800
So because those are immutable characteristics,

06:42.800 --> 06:46.480
those should be protected and considered under intersectionality.

06:46.480 --> 06:49.600
While the mutable characteristics, the stuff that you can change,

06:49.600 --> 06:52.480
like say being a gamer, shouldn't be considered

06:52.480 --> 06:54.800
because if you were actually oppressed for being a gamer,

06:54.800 --> 06:56.400
wouldn't you just stop playing video games?

06:56.960 --> 06:59.120
If it were that serious, I mean, probably.

06:59.120 --> 07:02.480
But the immutable characteristics line is not perfect either.

07:02.480 --> 07:06.000
Because, for example, the intersectionalists view religion

07:06.000 --> 07:09.840
as being one of the categories that you can be discriminated against for,

07:09.840 --> 07:11.440
and yet you can change your religion.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.520
If you are discriminated against for being a Muslim,

07:13.520 --> 07:15.680
you can convert away from Islam.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.600
You can stop practicing that religion.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.960
It's the same thing with culture.

07:18.960 --> 07:23.440
The people on the radical left do believe that culture can and should be changed

07:23.440 --> 07:25.600
swiftly and with state action.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.960
They advocate for it.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.920
You even get people like Joe Biden and, um, what was her name?

07:29.920 --> 07:30.880
Ayanna Pressley.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.720
They both made statements in the past that legal change is not enough.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.400
We have to change the culture.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.560
I realize they get a little too passionate about this sometimes,

07:38.560 --> 07:45.520
but we all have an obligation to do nothing less than change the culture in this country.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.320
That's just the laws.

07:46.320 --> 07:49.200
We change the laws, change the culture.

07:49.760 --> 07:54.000
So if culture can be changed and it's not an immutable characteristic,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.360
why should it be protected?

07:55.360 --> 07:59.280
Why should the excuse of it's my culture be valid within leftist thought?

07:59.280 --> 08:01.360
What about thin privilege and fat oppression?

08:01.360 --> 08:05.520
The intersection of left loves that stuff, but you can literally just lose the weight.

08:05.520 --> 08:10.000
We know for a fact that with the exception of the most extreme circumstances,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.520
the rarest of the rare cases, body weight is not immutable.

08:13.520 --> 08:17.680
And to get back to the trans question, according to at least some trans activists,

08:17.680 --> 08:21.840
because gender isn't immutable as well, then it also doesn't count.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.080
But very clearly, they don't view it this way.

08:24.080 --> 08:27.600
They don't seem to exclude things based on whether or not they're immutable,

08:27.600 --> 08:29.920
even though that is certainly how they present the issue.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.600
It seems to me that they exclude things arbitrarily from intersectional theory.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.160
They exclude things based on political expedience.

08:36.160 --> 08:38.640
But if you were to be an honest intersectionalist,

08:38.640 --> 08:41.920
and you did not exclude things solely for political reasons,

08:41.920 --> 08:45.360
but included into the theory everything, every part of your personality,

08:45.360 --> 08:47.280
you would very quickly realize two things.

08:47.280 --> 08:52.480
One, the intersectionality becomes entirely useless in day-to-day life,

08:52.480 --> 08:56.080
because there is no way you can even collect enough information

08:56.080 --> 08:57.840
about every single person that you meet

08:57.840 --> 09:00.320
in order to properly fractionate all of their identities,

09:00.320 --> 09:02.720
let alone actually be able to do the math on that.

09:02.720 --> 09:05.440
And two, you would also very quickly realize

09:05.440 --> 09:09.760
that if you ever were to actually do that, you would arrive at an individual.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.160
And I think this is what some of the libertarian thinkers mean

09:12.160 --> 09:15.760
when they say that the individual is the greatest minority of all,

09:16.400 --> 09:19.360
because there is only one individual against an entire society.

09:19.360 --> 09:23.520
And it is because if you were to actually work through the infinite math

09:23.520 --> 09:27.200
that is intersectionality, you would arrive at a completely unique person.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.920
I may demographically be like you in some ways,

09:29.920 --> 09:32.000
but no matter how similar we are,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.840
if we were to add up every single data point of our lives and then compare them,

09:35.840 --> 09:37.680
eventually we would come across a difference,

09:37.680 --> 09:39.440
and that would be what makes us individuals.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.840
So even though intersectionality is correct,

09:41.840 --> 09:44.400
individuality solves the problem of intersectionality,

09:44.400 --> 09:47.440
and it does it in a much more efficient and less oppressive way.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.960
Another thing that the radical left is right about is the problem of inequality.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.040
Inequality is a real problem.

09:53.040 --> 09:56.720
Too much inequality does in fact destabilize societies.

09:56.720 --> 10:01.520
If you have an entire 99% of people who live in abject poverty,

10:01.520 --> 10:06.160
and you have a 1% of people that lives high constantly with no middle class,

10:06.160 --> 10:10.560
if there is no legitimate way for advancement, then why wouldn't the people revolt?

10:10.560 --> 10:13.200
I mean, if they upend the entire thing,

10:13.200 --> 10:15.040
maybe they'll be back in the exact same position,

10:15.040 --> 10:17.360
but maybe they'll be in the 1% this time, who knows?

10:17.360 --> 10:22.480
We do know that at least some level of inequality is required to have an economy.

10:22.480 --> 10:26.400
That is because an economy is simply individuals acting freely.

10:26.400 --> 10:30.480
Therefore you have some individuals who are inclined to constantly work.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.560
It's just in their personality to work like 20 hour days,

10:34.560 --> 10:36.800
7 days a week for 50 years,

10:36.800 --> 10:39.680
and therefore they generate a disproportionate amount of production

10:39.680 --> 10:41.680
and gain a disproportionate amount of wealth.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.200
Freedom means not only the freedom to work or not work,

10:45.200 --> 10:47.520
it also means the freedom to work at what you like.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.960
Some careers will be more useful and therefore more lucrative,

10:50.960 --> 10:54.400
and freedom means the freedom to choose a career that might not pay as much.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.480
Freedom means the freedom to fail,

10:56.480 --> 11:00.240
or it means the freedom to succeed but to do so sub-optimally.

11:00.240 --> 11:04.400
If it takes you 6 years to get a 4 year degree, you're 2 years behind,

11:04.400 --> 11:06.320
and those people who got the degree in 4 years,

11:06.320 --> 11:08.400
well they have the freedom to get it in 4 years,

11:08.400 --> 11:10.000
and you have the freedom to get it in 6.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.480
Freedom does mean the freedom to make mistakes.

11:12.480 --> 11:17.280
All of these freedoms mean that people are basically allowed to work at their pace.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.560
They still have to maintain themselves,

11:18.560 --> 11:20.640
they still have to like pay for their food and stuff,

11:20.640 --> 11:23.680
because their own maintenance is their own responsibility.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.320
But for all that stuff that is above and beyond,

11:26.320 --> 11:28.720
people are free to go for it or not.

11:28.720 --> 11:29.840
And it is that difference,

11:29.840 --> 11:34.560
it is that inequality in personality that generates inequality in the market.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.480
It generates inequality of income,

11:36.480 --> 11:38.240
it generates inequality of status,

11:38.240 --> 11:39.760
it generates inequality of wealth.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.320
You do this for a few generations, you have an economy.

11:42.320 --> 11:46.080
So we do need inequality to generate wealth,

11:46.080 --> 11:47.600
and to keep society running.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.520
But you can't have too much inequality,

11:49.520 --> 11:53.920
such that those in the bottom who would actually want to try to work their way up,

11:53.920 --> 11:55.920
have no meaningful path to do so.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.080
Because if there is no meaningful path to do so,

11:58.080 --> 12:01.920
then they will destroy the system in an attempt to make a meaningful path to do so.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.480
The people on the left throw around this African proverb,

12:04.480 --> 12:07.280
those who are excluded from the village will burn it to feel its warmth.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.520
And that is true on some level.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.600
People will do what they want to do.

12:11.600 --> 12:16.240
If there is a legal, non-violent option for them to do what they want, they'll take it.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.480
If there isn't one, then they'll risk it.

12:18.480 --> 12:21.840
So if a society truly does have growing inequality,

12:21.840 --> 12:23.840
that's a problem that needs to be solved.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.720
And the issue that we're having is that we don't quite know how to solve it.

12:26.720 --> 12:30.160
The left's ideas regarding these redistribution schemes,

12:30.160 --> 12:32.880
and you know like UBI or high taxes, whatever,

12:33.840 --> 12:35.680
that stuff doesn't seem to work long term.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.560
We don't know what to do about the problem of equality.

12:38.560 --> 12:41.600
The left's ideas don't work, and the right's idea of

12:41.600 --> 12:45.040
let's ignore it, it's not a real problem, is asinine.

12:45.040 --> 12:49.120
Now we're getting deep into the Neo-Marxism because this kind of connects very nicely

12:49.120 --> 12:51.280
with the idea that structures are oppressive.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.320
And yes they are.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.520
The left is right about that too.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.760
A structure is oppressive.

12:55.760 --> 13:00.080
It's oppressive to those within it, and it is especially oppressive to those who are not in it.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.320
Hierarchies are inherently tyrannical,

13:02.320 --> 13:04.800
unless you are of course at the very top of the hierarchy.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.200
But the radical left's reply, you know,

13:07.200 --> 13:10.800
destroy all hierarchy, destroy the structures of society,

13:10.800 --> 13:12.800
that is even worse, because then you have nothing.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.480
Maybe they prefer nothing, you know.

13:14.480 --> 13:19.760
Maybe there are some people on the left who are more predisposed to enjoy chaos,

13:19.760 --> 13:25.360
while there are some people on the right who are more predisposed to enjoy tyrannical order,

13:25.360 --> 13:27.360
even if they are ground under the boot of it.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.800
But even though structures are oppressive, you can't simply take away the structure.

13:30.800 --> 13:34.720
Structures are what orient you in the world, at least in some way.

13:34.720 --> 13:38.240
Going back to the degree example, if you and I are getting the same degree,

13:38.240 --> 13:40.800
you get it in four years, and I get it in six years,

13:40.800 --> 13:44.800
and the reason I took two extra years is because I kept failing classes,

13:44.800 --> 13:48.320
or I had to take less classes because I didn't have the money, you know, whatever,

13:48.320 --> 13:52.160
then yes, the university structure is in some way oppressing me.

13:52.160 --> 13:56.000
There are things about my life that I have to deal with that you don't.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.360
There are problems that I have that are preventing me from graduating on time,

13:59.360 --> 14:02.480
and therefore the standards that I have to reach in order to get this degree,

14:03.200 --> 14:05.200
even though they're the same standard between us,

14:05.200 --> 14:07.840
they're harder for me to reach due to these extra circumstances.

14:07.840 --> 14:11.440
So the structure would be oppressing me more than it's oppressing you in that case.

14:11.440 --> 14:16.320
But that oppression is, it's a necessary part in human advancement.

14:16.320 --> 14:20.880
If there is no chance of failing something, then the success means nothing.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.640
Personal growth comes not only through victory, but through defeat.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.600
Sometimes you have to be destroyed so that you can be rebuilt.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.560
That's the whole walking through the fire analogy.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.640
You don't get to do that unscathed.

14:32.640 --> 14:37.280
Some parts of you will burn off, and that is a painful process to be sure,

14:37.280 --> 14:41.600
but it's what's left after that process that's important.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.960
So yes, the structures of society are inherently oppressive,

14:44.960 --> 14:48.720
but that is because they have standards and they judge you for not reaching them.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.560
I mean, how many times have you seen some

14:50.560 --> 14:53.360
self-centered person scream something like don't judge me?

14:53.360 --> 14:57.840
But the idea of a judge is that it is not only the thing that judges you,

14:57.840 --> 14:59.760
it is the thing that you aspire to be.

14:59.760 --> 15:04.640
That's why, for example, when you get a new job and you want to go in

15:04.640 --> 15:07.600
and make a good first impression with the new boss,

15:07.600 --> 15:10.720
yes, you are being judged and you're usually nervous about it,

15:10.720 --> 15:12.240
but you're also looking to do a good job.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.080
You're looking to climb the hierarchy here.

15:14.080 --> 15:18.400
The thing that judges you as either worthy or unworthy is also the thing

15:18.400 --> 15:21.920
that you are aspiring to become yourself through your own work.

15:21.920 --> 15:25.120
I think the religious folks really understand the purpose of judgment,

15:25.120 --> 15:25.920
at least some of them.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.480
There's always going to be some crazies out there,

15:28.480 --> 15:32.800
those people who simply use religion as a method by which they abuse other people,

15:32.800 --> 15:35.360
but at least the honest religious folk out there understand

15:35.360 --> 15:38.560
that judgment is not meant to make you feel oppressed.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.720
That is a side effect that can't be avoided.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.800
Judgment is the crucible in which you are made and you really aren't you.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.440
Like the current person that you are right now, that's not you.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.760
You were very different earlier in your life

15:49.760 --> 15:52.480
and you will be very different in the next five to 10 years.

15:52.480 --> 15:55.520
You are not your current personality or your current ambitions

15:55.520 --> 15:58.080
or your current property, your current location, your current job.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.040
You're not any of that.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.120
You are what's left after you walk through the fire.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.440
You are what's left after you go through the crucible.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.320
You are what's left after you are judged

16:06.320 --> 16:10.240
and then those things about you that are insufficient have to go away

16:10.240 --> 16:11.680
and then you build a different life.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.680
You are the thing that exists between multiple iterations of yourself

16:15.680 --> 16:20.960
and that cannot happen unless you have some kind of oppressive structure

16:20.960 --> 16:24.000
with which you can discipline yourself within.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.920
And I think that's why a lot of the people who complain about judgment

16:27.920 --> 16:30.800
or who complain about structures being inherently oppressive,

16:31.920 --> 16:35.440
they're like 35 year old man-children because they've never changed.

16:35.440 --> 16:39.520
They've never shaped themselves into anything beyond what they were when they were 14.

16:39.520 --> 16:45.200
Of course the big answer on the left to this whole thing is that nothing has inherent value

16:45.200 --> 16:47.200
and again the left is correct.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.720
Nothing has inherent value.

16:48.720 --> 16:53.200
I think this is what causes a lot of nihilism in people when they kind of realize that,

16:53.760 --> 16:56.400
let's be honest, religion isn't really real.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.000
God probably doesn't exist.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.560
There is probably nothing after death but the void

17:00.560 --> 17:03.280
and that reality does not care about you one way or another.

17:03.280 --> 17:06.960
There is an entire material universe out there that you will never experience.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.040
You will likely never leave this planet

17:09.040 --> 17:12.800
and when you are gone all of those stars and planets out there will keep spinning

17:12.800 --> 17:14.320
as if you never existed.

17:14.320 --> 17:16.640
Reality really doesn't have a moral arc.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.280
Things do not have inherent value.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.800
The post-modernists on the radical left are completely correct in this

17:22.800 --> 17:25.280
and that is fundamentally what fuels their nihilism.

17:25.280 --> 17:30.480
That's what fuels their desire to become Marxists because if there is nothing metaphysical,

17:30.480 --> 17:33.040
if there really is only darkness out there,

17:33.040 --> 17:35.040
then a person like that would probably

17:35.840 --> 17:38.880
1. be completely invested in the pleasure principle,

17:38.880 --> 17:42.400
simply acting in a way that is purely selfish and feels the best for the time

17:42.400 --> 17:44.480
and avoiding as much pain as they can

17:44.480 --> 17:50.000
and 2. desire a society that will allow them to do that no matter what

17:50.000 --> 17:54.240
because if there's no inherent value then there's no ideal to strive towards

17:54.240 --> 17:57.360
and if all you have left is impulsive pleasure seeking

17:57.360 --> 18:00.480
in order to try and stave off the fear of death

18:00.480 --> 18:02.800
then all of society should be structured around that,

18:02.800 --> 18:04.720
hence the communist utopia.

18:04.720 --> 18:08.240
It really is like a baby's first nihilism kind of philosophy

18:08.240 --> 18:10.400
and I went through that phase myself at least a little bit

18:10.400 --> 18:13.680
but I kind of figured out very quickly that kind of impulsive pleasure seeking

18:13.680 --> 18:16.480
was fun for a little bit but it rapidly made things worse

18:16.480 --> 18:21.360
and that the gift of nihilism is not that things have no inherent meaning

18:21.360 --> 18:25.840
and therefore we should all simply inject heroin and jack our brains up

18:25.840 --> 18:28.080
to feel nothing but pleasure until we inevitably die

18:28.080 --> 18:31.280
but rather that because things have no inherent value

18:31.280 --> 18:35.280
that means that I can assign value to them as a free thinking person.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.400
I can value my girlfriend because of the relationship we have,

18:38.400 --> 18:41.680
not because she has any inherent value as far as the universe is concerned

18:41.680 --> 18:43.440
but because of what she means to me.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.600
I can find the people in my life valuable

18:45.600 --> 18:49.520
or I can find new people to find valuable if the ones around me aren't really worth it.

18:49.520 --> 18:54.000
I can find value in the stuff that I build even if I know that one day it will be gone.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.240
I can find value in the people that I help

18:56.240 --> 18:59.600
even if I know that one day I'll be gone and so will they.

18:59.600 --> 19:04.480
If you can alleviate some of the unnecessary suffering in life

19:04.480 --> 19:08.720
that might not have any inherent value but it can certainly have value to you.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.840
You would have to basically be a sociopath to not like

19:11.840 --> 19:16.080
enjoy the feeling that you get when you've bought someone a birthday gift for example

19:16.640 --> 19:19.840
and it's exactly what they want and they unwrap it and they're ecstatic.

19:19.840 --> 19:24.480
These things don't have inherent value but based on your own personality

19:24.480 --> 19:27.280
you can definitely find things that have value to you

19:27.280 --> 19:30.880
and if you're a well-rounded person that will be enough to carry you forward through your life.

19:30.880 --> 19:34.480
Of course if you're underdeveloped then it won't.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.960
I've noticed that people on the left they like to say that it's the far right,

19:36.960 --> 19:38.960
it's the alt-right, they're destroying society right now.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.800
People on the right say the same thing about the left,

19:40.800 --> 19:43.440
they call them leftists, liberals, marxists, whatever.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.040
My point is is that it's neither.

19:45.040 --> 19:49.200
We need both liberalism and conservatism but not only do we need them,

19:49.200 --> 19:52.000
we can never actually rid ourselves of one or the other.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.840
There will always be personality types that are more suited to liberal thought.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.200
There will always be personality types that are more suited to conservative thought.

19:59.200 --> 20:03.360
And liberals and conservatives both bring different yet useful things to the table.

20:03.360 --> 20:08.640
Liberals often have personality types that make them more open to new experiences, more creative.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.280
They're not just our society's artists but also our engineers.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.880
They come up with the new ideas.

20:12.880 --> 20:17.760
Meanwhile conservatives have personality types that lend them more to be organizers.

20:17.760 --> 20:21.680
They might not invent the next big thing but they will definitely optimize it.

20:21.680 --> 20:25.920
The liberals and the conservatives are two essential cogs in the machine.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.200
If you remove either of them the entire thing falls apart.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.680
You need both and you need them both working together.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.520
So as a centrist it's important to understand what the left actually gets right

20:36.080 --> 20:38.560
and not simply throw the baby out with the bathwater.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.800
All right that about does it for me.

20:41.360 --> 20:42.400
I'll talk to you guys soon.

20:42.880 --> 20:43.920
I love you.
