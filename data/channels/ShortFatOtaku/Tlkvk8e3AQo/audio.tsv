0	3840	Here's a video you might not want to watch, but I do think it's important.
3840	10240	When is the radical left actually right? I don't mean right-leaning, I mean correct.
10240	14320	What have they got properly pegged? What can we learn from them?
14320	19360	Even though they're often just a bunch of clowns who have no idea how the real world works,
19360	25280	they also regularly have important and powerful insights and we would do well not to ignore them.
25280	28240	This video might be the one that actually gets me cancelled by my own audience,
28240	32240	but I do believe it to be the truth, so I don't care, no offense guys.
32240	34080	Come into this with an open mind, alright?
34080	40000	Firstly, intersectionality is correct. For those of you who don't know, intersectional theory
40000	45040	is the idea that you have privilege or oppression based on your various characteristics,
45040	48880	and that each individual characteristic intersects to form a new identity.
48880	53200	It was described to me by my gender studies professors as being the bars of a cage,
53200	58000	where one bar is your sex, another bar is your race, another bar is your ethnicity,
58000	62400	your nationality, your gender identity, your sexual orientation, etc etc.
62400	65920	And that while one individual bar may not be oppressive,
65920	69360	when they're all summed up they form the thing that entraps you.
69360	73520	They often like to use an image like this that kind of describes the theory,
73520	76400	where each of these various characteristics overlap,
76400	80080	and the more overlapping that happens where you are, the more oppressed you are.
80080	84560	This is where you get the idea of the progressive stack, or the oppression olympics,
84560	89360	where a black man might be oppressed but he's not as oppressed as a black gay woman,
89360	90720	or something along those lines.
90720	93680	The problem with this image is that this phenomenon functions
93680	96640	less like a Venn diagram and more like a chart,
96640	101680	an ever expanding chart where every single identity can be multiplied by every single
101680	105680	other identity. You have to fractionate race with gender, okay?
105680	108320	Let's say you have two genders, male and female,
108320	112000	let's say you have three races, white, black, Asian.
112000	114960	I know this is very oversimplified but just just hear me out.
114960	118800	That means that you have six fractionations, the three races multiplied by the two genders.
118800	123120	But now you have to add in all the other genders that the radical left insists exists.
123120	126880	You also have to add in all the other races, so suddenly you have many different identities.
126880	130800	And we haven't even gotten to sexual orientation yet, or gender identity, or ethnicity,
130800	134960	nationality, disability, class, or socioeconomic status.
135200	138960	And when we talk about those things, are we just going to talk about their income?
138960	141840	Or is there more to it than that? How about debt?
141840	146320	The problem with intersectional theory is, despite being technically correct,
146320	150320	it is a completely unworkable theory in practice because there are simply
150320	152320	too many identities to fractionate.
152320	154720	Again, that's where you get the Oppression Olympics.
154720	157200	I mean, how do we determine who has it worse?
157200	159600	One person says I'm a gay male.
159600	161760	One person says I'm a gay female.
161760	164160	One person says I'm a black gay female.
164160	167920	I'm a black gay female who's trapped in an abusive relationship.
167920	173440	I'm a bisexual trans Latina illegal immigrant who just got diagnosed with cancer,
173440	176800	and who has a child who should be going to one of the best schools in the country
176800	179600	because he has a phenomenal IQ, but I just can't afford it.
179600	182480	You know, all these situations suck in their own way.
182480	186400	Everyone has something that makes them oppressed, even the straight white males.
186400	188640	So how do you figure out who's more oppressed?
188640	191600	And most importantly of all, who gets to decide?
191600	196400	Who will be the arbiter of who is the most oppressed and therefore should have
196400	198720	more resources allocated to them by the state?
198720	202160	Because reparations are one of the long-term goals of the intersectionalists.
202160	204560	So the person who gets to decide how oppressed you are,
204560	206640	that's not some minor point in the conversation.
206640	207840	That is the linchpin.
207840	209200	Who gets to decide?
209200	211280	How do you know that they're being accurate?
211280	213200	How do you know they're being impartial?
213200	214800	How do you know they're not corrupt?
214800	217600	Their power would have to basically be everywhere.
217600	220480	They'd have to have tendrils in every single aspect of society
220480	222000	in order to properly do this.
222000	224960	How does this system not instantly devolve into a tyranny?
224960	227600	I mean, at least with capitalism.
227600	231440	And this we're talking about extreme disparities between like the ultra rich,
231440	234880	the 1% of the 1% and people who are like homeless or something.
234880	237680	But in most cases within capitalism,
237680	240320	all this stuff is rolled up into the price that you pay.
240320	245680	You know, you've got poor, oppressed, victimized you with all of your problems
245680	246880	and you might need something.
246880	248960	So you go out to a store and you go to buy it.
248960	254000	And then the shopkeeper who has all of his poor oppressions and victimizations,
254000	257520	things that you don't see because you're only interacting with him for a few seconds,
257520	259600	he's willing to sell you something for a price.
259600	261920	And all of his oppression is packed into his price
261920	265280	and all of your oppression is packed into the amount that you're willing to pay for it.
265280	268400	And sometimes you can negotiate, sometimes you can cut a deal,
268400	270480	sometimes you can just go look elsewhere.
270480	272880	But at the very least with capitalism,
272880	276720	there is some kind of understanding that yes, we're all in this together,
276720	278880	but that also means that you have to pay your own way.
279360	280480	They got to eat too.
280480	282720	They will give you something that will improve your life
282720	286000	and you have to give something that will improve their life in turn.
286000	288960	And generally what that thing is, is what they buy with your money.
288960	292320	And in doing it this way, you avoid the problem of intersectionality.
292320	296160	You no longer need to take the millions of possible identities into account
296160	299120	because those millions of possible identities,
299120	301360	all of those ways in which you can be oppressed,
301360	305760	that is the fatal flaw in my opinion of the intersectional theory.
305760	310320	The leftist argument against this is that not all identities are equally valid.
310320	313200	I mean, they will say to you in general that all identities are valid,
313200	317680	but there are very clearly some they do not put inside intersectional theory.
317680	320560	For example, you have that meme floating around right now
320560	323360	that gamers are the most oppressed minority.
323360	327600	You know, we live in a society, bottom text, that kind of stuff.
327600	331280	But it does technically fit within intersectional theory.
331280	333200	They really don't like it, but it does.
333200	337120	Being a gamer or not being a gamer is a characteristic about yourself.
337120	339280	And if you come from my generation,
339280	342240	a generation where almost nobody played video games,
342240	344640	yeah, you got bullied at school if you played them.
344640	346720	Of course, it's not just gamers.
346720	349680	Any identifiable characteristic about yourself
349680	354000	that anybody for any reason has at some point disparaged you for,
354640	356080	you could claim as oppression.
356080	361360	That opens the door for you to be oppressed by quite literally anything about you.
361360	362960	But it fits with the theory.
362960	366160	Therefore, the meme gamers are the most oppressed minority
366160	369120	is not poking fun at the idea that gamers think that they're oppressed
369120	370560	just because they got bullied in school.
370560	376080	It's poking fun at how nonsensical the entirety of intersectional theory is.
376080	377600	But that is politically inconvenient.
377600	380880	So intersectionalists do say that only some parts of your identity
380880	382720	actually matter when it comes to intersectionality,
382720	385680	but they never really make it clear where the line is drawn.
385680	388480	You think that it would be drawn at immutable characteristics.
388480	390800	So for example, you can't change your physical sex,
390800	393200	although trans activists are really pushing that right now.
393200	394800	You certainly can't change your race.
394800	396960	There seems to be very little evidence in the way
396960	400000	of being able to change your sexual orientation.
400000	402800	So because those are immutable characteristics,
402800	406480	those should be protected and considered under intersectionality.
406480	409600	While the mutable characteristics, the stuff that you can change,
409600	412480	like say being a gamer, shouldn't be considered
412480	414800	because if you were actually oppressed for being a gamer,
414800	416400	wouldn't you just stop playing video games?
416960	419120	If it were that serious, I mean, probably.
419120	422480	But the immutable characteristics line is not perfect either.
422480	426000	Because, for example, the intersectionalists view religion
426000	429840	as being one of the categories that you can be discriminated against for,
429840	431440	and yet you can change your religion.
431440	433520	If you are discriminated against for being a Muslim,
433520	435680	you can convert away from Islam.
435680	437600	You can stop practicing that religion.
437600	438960	It's the same thing with culture.
438960	443440	The people on the radical left do believe that culture can and should be changed
443440	445600	swiftly and with state action.
445600	446960	They advocate for it.
446960	449920	You even get people like Joe Biden and, um, what was her name?
449920	450880	Ayanna Pressley.
450880	454720	They both made statements in the past that legal change is not enough.
454720	456400	We have to change the culture.
456400	458560	I realize they get a little too passionate about this sometimes,
458560	465520	but we all have an obligation to do nothing less than change the culture in this country.
465520	466320	That's just the laws.
466320	469200	We change the laws, change the culture.
469760	474000	So if culture can be changed and it's not an immutable characteristic,
474000	475360	why should it be protected?
475360	479280	Why should the excuse of it's my culture be valid within leftist thought?
479280	481360	What about thin privilege and fat oppression?
481360	485520	The intersection of left loves that stuff, but you can literally just lose the weight.
485520	490000	We know for a fact that with the exception of the most extreme circumstances,
490000	493520	the rarest of the rare cases, body weight is not immutable.
493520	497680	And to get back to the trans question, according to at least some trans activists,
497680	501840	because gender isn't immutable as well, then it also doesn't count.
501840	504080	But very clearly, they don't view it this way.
504080	507600	They don't seem to exclude things based on whether or not they're immutable,
507600	509920	even though that is certainly how they present the issue.
509920	513600	It seems to me that they exclude things arbitrarily from intersectional theory.
513600	516160	They exclude things based on political expedience.
516160	518640	But if you were to be an honest intersectionalist,
518640	521920	and you did not exclude things solely for political reasons,
521920	525360	but included into the theory everything, every part of your personality,
525360	527280	you would very quickly realize two things.
527280	532480	One, the intersectionality becomes entirely useless in day-to-day life,
532480	536080	because there is no way you can even collect enough information
536080	537840	about every single person that you meet
537840	540320	in order to properly fractionate all of their identities,
540320	542720	let alone actually be able to do the math on that.
542720	545440	And two, you would also very quickly realize
545440	549760	that if you ever were to actually do that, you would arrive at an individual.
549760	552160	And I think this is what some of the libertarian thinkers mean
552160	555760	when they say that the individual is the greatest minority of all,
556400	559360	because there is only one individual against an entire society.
559360	563520	And it is because if you were to actually work through the infinite math
563520	567200	that is intersectionality, you would arrive at a completely unique person.
567200	569920	I may demographically be like you in some ways,
569920	572000	but no matter how similar we are,
572000	575840	if we were to add up every single data point of our lives and then compare them,
575840	577680	eventually we would come across a difference,
577680	579440	and that would be what makes us individuals.
579440	581840	So even though intersectionality is correct,
581840	584400	individuality solves the problem of intersectionality,
584400	587440	and it does it in a much more efficient and less oppressive way.
587440	590960	Another thing that the radical left is right about is the problem of inequality.
590960	593040	Inequality is a real problem.
593040	596720	Too much inequality does in fact destabilize societies.
596720	601520	If you have an entire 99% of people who live in abject poverty,
601520	606160	and you have a 1% of people that lives high constantly with no middle class,
606160	610560	if there is no legitimate way for advancement, then why wouldn't the people revolt?
610560	613200	I mean, if they upend the entire thing,
613200	615040	maybe they'll be back in the exact same position,
615040	617360	but maybe they'll be in the 1% this time, who knows?
617360	622480	We do know that at least some level of inequality is required to have an economy.
622480	626400	That is because an economy is simply individuals acting freely.
626400	630480	Therefore you have some individuals who are inclined to constantly work.
630480	634560	It's just in their personality to work like 20 hour days,
634560	636800	7 days a week for 50 years,
636800	639680	and therefore they generate a disproportionate amount of production
639680	641680	and gain a disproportionate amount of wealth.
641680	645200	Freedom means not only the freedom to work or not work,
645200	647520	it also means the freedom to work at what you like.
647520	650960	Some careers will be more useful and therefore more lucrative,
650960	654400	and freedom means the freedom to choose a career that might not pay as much.
654400	656480	Freedom means the freedom to fail,
656480	660240	or it means the freedom to succeed but to do so sub-optimally.
660240	664400	If it takes you 6 years to get a 4 year degree, you're 2 years behind,
664400	666320	and those people who got the degree in 4 years,
666320	668400	well they have the freedom to get it in 4 years,
668400	670000	and you have the freedom to get it in 6.
670000	672480	Freedom does mean the freedom to make mistakes.
672480	677280	All of these freedoms mean that people are basically allowed to work at their pace.
677280	678560	They still have to maintain themselves,
678560	680640	they still have to like pay for their food and stuff,
680640	683680	because their own maintenance is their own responsibility.
683680	686320	But for all that stuff that is above and beyond,
686320	688720	people are free to go for it or not.
688720	689840	And it is that difference,
689840	694560	it is that inequality in personality that generates inequality in the market.
694560	696480	It generates inequality of income,
696480	698240	it generates inequality of status,
698240	699760	it generates inequality of wealth.
700000	702320	You do this for a few generations, you have an economy.
702320	706080	So we do need inequality to generate wealth,
706080	707600	and to keep society running.
707600	709520	But you can't have too much inequality,
709520	713920	such that those in the bottom who would actually want to try to work their way up,
713920	715920	have no meaningful path to do so.
715920	718080	Because if there is no meaningful path to do so,
718080	721920	then they will destroy the system in an attempt to make a meaningful path to do so.
721920	724480	The people on the left throw around this African proverb,
724480	727280	those who are excluded from the village will burn it to feel its warmth.
727840	729520	And that is true on some level.
729520	731600	People will do what they want to do.
731600	736240	If there is a legal, non-violent option for them to do what they want, they'll take it.
736240	738480	If there isn't one, then they'll risk it.
738480	741840	So if a society truly does have growing inequality,
741840	743840	that's a problem that needs to be solved.
743840	746720	And the issue that we're having is that we don't quite know how to solve it.
746720	750160	The left's ideas regarding these redistribution schemes,
750160	752880	and you know like UBI or high taxes, whatever,
753840	755680	that stuff doesn't seem to work long term.
755680	758560	We don't know what to do about the problem of equality.
758560	761600	The left's ideas don't work, and the right's idea of
761600	765040	let's ignore it, it's not a real problem, is asinine.
765040	769120	Now we're getting deep into the Neo-Marxism because this kind of connects very nicely
769120	771280	with the idea that structures are oppressive.
771280	772320	And yes they are.
772320	773520	The left is right about that too.
774080	775760	A structure is oppressive.
775760	780080	It's oppressive to those within it, and it is especially oppressive to those who are not in it.
780080	782320	Hierarchies are inherently tyrannical,
782320	784800	unless you are of course at the very top of the hierarchy.
784800	787200	But the radical left's reply, you know,
787200	790800	destroy all hierarchy, destroy the structures of society,
790800	792800	that is even worse, because then you have nothing.
792800	794480	Maybe they prefer nothing, you know.
794480	799760	Maybe there are some people on the left who are more predisposed to enjoy chaos,
799760	805360	while there are some people on the right who are more predisposed to enjoy tyrannical order,
805360	807360	even if they are ground under the boot of it.
807360	810800	But even though structures are oppressive, you can't simply take away the structure.
810800	814720	Structures are what orient you in the world, at least in some way.
814720	818240	Going back to the degree example, if you and I are getting the same degree,
818240	820800	you get it in four years, and I get it in six years,
820800	824800	and the reason I took two extra years is because I kept failing classes,
824800	828320	or I had to take less classes because I didn't have the money, you know, whatever,
828320	832160	then yes, the university structure is in some way oppressing me.
832160	836000	There are things about my life that I have to deal with that you don't.
836000	839360	There are problems that I have that are preventing me from graduating on time,
839360	842480	and therefore the standards that I have to reach in order to get this degree,
843200	845200	even though they're the same standard between us,
845200	847840	they're harder for me to reach due to these extra circumstances.
847840	851440	So the structure would be oppressing me more than it's oppressing you in that case.
851440	856320	But that oppression is, it's a necessary part in human advancement.
856320	860880	If there is no chance of failing something, then the success means nothing.
860880	864640	Personal growth comes not only through victory, but through defeat.
864640	867600	Sometimes you have to be destroyed so that you can be rebuilt.
867600	870560	That's the whole walking through the fire analogy.
870560	872640	You don't get to do that unscathed.
872640	877280	Some parts of you will burn off, and that is a painful process to be sure,
877280	881600	but it's what's left after that process that's important.
881600	884960	So yes, the structures of society are inherently oppressive,
884960	888720	but that is because they have standards and they judge you for not reaching them.
888720	890560	I mean, how many times have you seen some
890560	893360	self-centered person scream something like don't judge me?
893360	897840	But the idea of a judge is that it is not only the thing that judges you,
897840	899760	it is the thing that you aspire to be.
899760	904640	That's why, for example, when you get a new job and you want to go in
904640	907600	and make a good first impression with the new boss,
907600	910720	yes, you are being judged and you're usually nervous about it,
910720	912240	but you're also looking to do a good job.
912240	914080	You're looking to climb the hierarchy here.
914080	918400	The thing that judges you as either worthy or unworthy is also the thing
918400	921920	that you are aspiring to become yourself through your own work.
921920	925120	I think the religious folks really understand the purpose of judgment,
925120	925920	at least some of them.
925920	928480	There's always going to be some crazies out there,
928480	932800	those people who simply use religion as a method by which they abuse other people,
932800	935360	but at least the honest religious folk out there understand
935360	938560	that judgment is not meant to make you feel oppressed.
938560	940720	That is a side effect that can't be avoided.
940720	944800	Judgment is the crucible in which you are made and you really aren't you.
944800	947440	Like the current person that you are right now, that's not you.
947440	949760	You were very different earlier in your life
949760	952480	and you will be very different in the next five to 10 years.
952480	955520	You are not your current personality or your current ambitions
955520	958080	or your current property, your current location, your current job.
958080	959040	You're not any of that.
959040	961120	You are what's left after you walk through the fire.
961120	963440	You are what's left after you go through the crucible.
963440	966320	You are what's left after you are judged
966320	970240	and then those things about you that are insufficient have to go away
970240	971680	and then you build a different life.
971680	975680	You are the thing that exists between multiple iterations of yourself
975680	980960	and that cannot happen unless you have some kind of oppressive structure
980960	984000	with which you can discipline yourself within.
984000	987920	And I think that's why a lot of the people who complain about judgment
987920	990800	or who complain about structures being inherently oppressive,
991920	995440	they're like 35 year old man-children because they've never changed.
995440	999520	They've never shaped themselves into anything beyond what they were when they were 14.
999520	1005200	Of course the big answer on the left to this whole thing is that nothing has inherent value
1005200	1007200	and again the left is correct.
1007200	1008720	Nothing has inherent value.
1008720	1013200	I think this is what causes a lot of nihilism in people when they kind of realize that,
1013760	1016400	let's be honest, religion isn't really real.
1016400	1018000	God probably doesn't exist.
1018000	1020560	There is probably nothing after death but the void
1020560	1023280	and that reality does not care about you one way or another.
1023280	1026960	There is an entire material universe out there that you will never experience.
1026960	1029040	You will likely never leave this planet
1029040	1032800	and when you are gone all of those stars and planets out there will keep spinning
1032800	1034320	as if you never existed.
1034320	1036640	Reality really doesn't have a moral arc.
1037280	1039280	Things do not have inherent value.
1039280	1042800	The post-modernists on the radical left are completely correct in this
1042800	1045280	and that is fundamentally what fuels their nihilism.
1045280	1050480	That's what fuels their desire to become Marxists because if there is nothing metaphysical,
1050480	1053040	if there really is only darkness out there,
1053040	1055040	then a person like that would probably
1055840	1058880	1. be completely invested in the pleasure principle,
1058880	1062400	simply acting in a way that is purely selfish and feels the best for the time
1062400	1064480	and avoiding as much pain as they can
1064480	1070000	and 2. desire a society that will allow them to do that no matter what
1070000	1074240	because if there's no inherent value then there's no ideal to strive towards
1074240	1077360	and if all you have left is impulsive pleasure seeking
1077360	1080480	in order to try and stave off the fear of death
1080480	1082800	then all of society should be structured around that,
1082800	1084720	hence the communist utopia.
1084720	1088240	It really is like a baby's first nihilism kind of philosophy
1088240	1090400	and I went through that phase myself at least a little bit
1090400	1093680	but I kind of figured out very quickly that kind of impulsive pleasure seeking
1093680	1096480	was fun for a little bit but it rapidly made things worse
1096480	1101360	and that the gift of nihilism is not that things have no inherent meaning
1101360	1105840	and therefore we should all simply inject heroin and jack our brains up
1105840	1108080	to feel nothing but pleasure until we inevitably die
1108080	1111280	but rather that because things have no inherent value
1111280	1115280	that means that I can assign value to them as a free thinking person.
1115280	1118400	I can value my girlfriend because of the relationship we have,
1118400	1121680	not because she has any inherent value as far as the universe is concerned
1121680	1123440	but because of what she means to me.
1123440	1125600	I can find the people in my life valuable
1125600	1129520	or I can find new people to find valuable if the ones around me aren't really worth it.
1129520	1134000	I can find value in the stuff that I build even if I know that one day it will be gone.
1134000	1136240	I can find value in the people that I help
1136240	1139600	even if I know that one day I'll be gone and so will they.
1139600	1144480	If you can alleviate some of the unnecessary suffering in life
1144480	1148720	that might not have any inherent value but it can certainly have value to you.
1148720	1151840	You would have to basically be a sociopath to not like
1151840	1156080	enjoy the feeling that you get when you've bought someone a birthday gift for example
1156640	1159840	and it's exactly what they want and they unwrap it and they're ecstatic.
1159840	1164480	These things don't have inherent value but based on your own personality
1164480	1167280	you can definitely find things that have value to you
1167280	1170880	and if you're a well-rounded person that will be enough to carry you forward through your life.
1170880	1174480	Of course if you're underdeveloped then it won't.
1174480	1176960	I've noticed that people on the left they like to say that it's the far right,
1176960	1178960	it's the alt-right, they're destroying society right now.
1178960	1180800	People on the right say the same thing about the left,
1180800	1183440	they call them leftists, liberals, marxists, whatever.
1183440	1185040	My point is is that it's neither.
1185040	1189200	We need both liberalism and conservatism but not only do we need them,
1189200	1192000	we can never actually rid ourselves of one or the other.
1192000	1195840	There will always be personality types that are more suited to liberal thought.
1195840	1199200	There will always be personality types that are more suited to conservative thought.
1199200	1203360	And liberals and conservatives both bring different yet useful things to the table.
1203360	1208640	Liberals often have personality types that make them more open to new experiences, more creative.
1208640	1211280	They're not just our society's artists but also our engineers.
1211280	1212880	They come up with the new ideas.
1212880	1217760	Meanwhile conservatives have personality types that lend them more to be organizers.
1217760	1221680	They might not invent the next big thing but they will definitely optimize it.
1221680	1225920	The liberals and the conservatives are two essential cogs in the machine.
1225920	1229200	If you remove either of them the entire thing falls apart.
1229200	1231680	You need both and you need them both working together.
1231680	1235520	So as a centrist it's important to understand what the left actually gets right
1236080	1238560	and not simply throw the baby out with the bathwater.
1239120	1240800	All right that about does it for me.
1241360	1242400	I'll talk to you guys soon.
1242880	1243920	I love you.
