1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Here's a video you might not want to watch, but I do think it's important.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,240
When is the radical left actually right? I don't mean right-leaning, I mean correct.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,320
What have they got properly pegged? What can we learn from them?

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,360
Even though they're often just a bunch of clowns who have no idea how the real world works,

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:25,280
they also regularly have important and powerful insights and we would do well not to ignore them.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,240
This video might be the one that actually gets me cancelled by my own audience,

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,240
but I do believe it to be the truth, so I don't care, no offense guys.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,080
Come into this with an open mind, alright?

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,000
Firstly, intersectionality is correct. For those of you who don't know, intersectional theory

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,040
is the idea that you have privilege or oppression based on your various characteristics,

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,880
and that each individual characteristic intersects to form a new identity.

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,200
It was described to me by my gender studies professors as being the bars of a cage,

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,000
where one bar is your sex, another bar is your race, another bar is your ethnicity,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,400
your nationality, your gender identity, your sexual orientation, etc etc.

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,920
And that while one individual bar may not be oppressive,

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,360
when they're all summed up they form the thing that entraps you.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,520
They often like to use an image like this that kind of describes the theory,

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,400
where each of these various characteristics overlap,

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,080
and the more overlapping that happens where you are, the more oppressed you are.

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,560
This is where you get the idea of the progressive stack, or the oppression olympics,

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,360
where a black man might be oppressed but he's not as oppressed as a black gay woman,

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,720
or something along those lines.

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,680
The problem with this image is that this phenomenon functions

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,640
less like a Venn diagram and more like a chart,

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,680
an ever expanding chart where every single identity can be multiplied by every single

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,680
other identity. You have to fractionate race with gender, okay?

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,320
Let's say you have two genders, male and female,

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,000
let's say you have three races, white, black, Asian.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,960
I know this is very oversimplified but just just hear me out.

30
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,800
That means that you have six fractionations, the three races multiplied by the two genders.

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,120
But now you have to add in all the other genders that the radical left insists exists.

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,880
You also have to add in all the other races, so suddenly you have many different identities.

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,800
And we haven't even gotten to sexual orientation yet, or gender identity, or ethnicity,

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,960
nationality, disability, class, or socioeconomic status.

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,960
And when we talk about those things, are we just going to talk about their income?

36
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,840
Or is there more to it than that? How about debt?

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,320
The problem with intersectional theory is, despite being technically correct,

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,320
it is a completely unworkable theory in practice because there are simply

39
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,320
too many identities to fractionate.

40
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,720
Again, that's where you get the Oppression Olympics.

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,200
I mean, how do we determine who has it worse?

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,600
One person says I'm a gay male.

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,760
One person says I'm a gay female.

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,160
One person says I'm a black gay female.

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,920
I'm a black gay female who's trapped in an abusive relationship.

46
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,440
I'm a bisexual trans Latina illegal immigrant who just got diagnosed with cancer,

47
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,800
and who has a child who should be going to one of the best schools in the country

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,600
because he has a phenomenal IQ, but I just can't afford it.

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,480
You know, all these situations suck in their own way.

50
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,400
Everyone has something that makes them oppressed, even the straight white males.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
So how do you figure out who's more oppressed?

52
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,600
And most importantly of all, who gets to decide?

53
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,400
Who will be the arbiter of who is the most oppressed and therefore should have

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,720
more resources allocated to them by the state?

55
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,160
Because reparations are one of the long-term goals of the intersectionalists.

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,560
So the person who gets to decide how oppressed you are,

57
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
that's not some minor point in the conversation.

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,840
That is the linchpin.

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,200
Who gets to decide?

60
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,280
How do you know that they're being accurate?

61
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,200
How do you know they're being impartial?

62
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
How do you know they're not corrupt?

63
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Their power would have to basically be everywhere.

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,480
They'd have to have tendrils in every single aspect of society

65
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,000
in order to properly do this.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,960
How does this system not instantly devolve into a tyranny?

67
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,600
I mean, at least with capitalism.

68
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,440
And this we're talking about extreme disparities between like the ultra rich,

69
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,880
the 1% of the 1% and people who are like homeless or something.

70
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,680
But in most cases within capitalism,

71
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,320
all this stuff is rolled up into the price that you pay.

72
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,680
You know, you've got poor, oppressed, victimized you with all of your problems

73
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,880
and you might need something.

74
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,960
So you go out to a store and you go to buy it.

75
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,000
And then the shopkeeper who has all of his poor oppressions and victimizations,

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,520
things that you don't see because you're only interacting with him for a few seconds,

77
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,600
he's willing to sell you something for a price.

78
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,920
And all of his oppression is packed into his price

79
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,280
and all of your oppression is packed into the amount that you're willing to pay for it.

80
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,400
And sometimes you can negotiate, sometimes you can cut a deal,

81
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,480
sometimes you can just go look elsewhere.

82
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,880
But at the very least with capitalism,

83
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,720
there is some kind of understanding that yes, we're all in this together,

84
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
but that also means that you have to pay your own way.

85
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,480
They got to eat too.

86
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,720
They will give you something that will improve your life

87
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
and you have to give something that will improve their life in turn.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,960
And generally what that thing is, is what they buy with your money.

89
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,320
And in doing it this way, you avoid the problem of intersectionality.

90
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,160
You no longer need to take the millions of possible identities into account

91
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,120
because those millions of possible identities,

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
all of those ways in which you can be oppressed,

93
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,760
that is the fatal flaw in my opinion of the intersectional theory.

94
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,320
The leftist argument against this is that not all identities are equally valid.

95
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,200
I mean, they will say to you in general that all identities are valid,

96
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,680
but there are very clearly some they do not put inside intersectional theory.

97
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,560
For example, you have that meme floating around right now

98
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,360
that gamers are the most oppressed minority.

99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,600
You know, we live in a society, bottom text, that kind of stuff.

100
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,280
But it does technically fit within intersectional theory.

101
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,200
They really don't like it, but it does.

102
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,120
Being a gamer or not being a gamer is a characteristic about yourself.

103
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,280
And if you come from my generation,

104
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,240
a generation where almost nobody played video games,

105
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,640
yeah, you got bullied at school if you played them.

106
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,720
Of course, it's not just gamers.

107
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,680
Any identifiable characteristic about yourself

108
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,000
that anybody for any reason has at some point disparaged you for,

109
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,080
you could claim as oppression.

110
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,360
That opens the door for you to be oppressed by quite literally anything about you.

111
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,960
But it fits with the theory.

112
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,160
Therefore, the meme gamers are the most oppressed minority

113
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,120
is not poking fun at the idea that gamers think that they're oppressed

114
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,560
just because they got bullied in school.

115
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,080
It's poking fun at how nonsensical the entirety of intersectional theory is.

116
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,600
But that is politically inconvenient.

117
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,880
So intersectionalists do say that only some parts of your identity

118
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,720
actually matter when it comes to intersectionality,

119
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,680
but they never really make it clear where the line is drawn.

120
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,480
You think that it would be drawn at immutable characteristics.

121
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,800
So for example, you can't change your physical sex,

122
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,200
although trans activists are really pushing that right now.

123
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,800
You certainly can't change your race.

124
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,960
There seems to be very little evidence in the way

125
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,000
of being able to change your sexual orientation.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,800
So because those are immutable characteristics,

127
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,480
those should be protected and considered under intersectionality.

128
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,600
While the mutable characteristics, the stuff that you can change,

129
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,480
like say being a gamer, shouldn't be considered

130
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,800
because if you were actually oppressed for being a gamer,

131
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,400
wouldn't you just stop playing video games?

132
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
If it were that serious, I mean, probably.

133
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,480
But the immutable characteristics line is not perfect either.

134
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,000
Because, for example, the intersectionalists view religion

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,840
as being one of the categories that you can be discriminated against for,

136
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,440
and yet you can change your religion.

137
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,520
If you are discriminated against for being a Muslim,

138
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
you can convert away from Islam.

139
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,600
You can stop practicing that religion.

140
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,960
It's the same thing with culture.

141
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,440
The people on the radical left do believe that culture can and should be changed

142
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,600
swiftly and with state action.

143
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,960
They advocate for it.

144
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,920
You even get people like Joe Biden and, um, what was her name?

145
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,880
Ayanna Pressley.

146
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,720
They both made statements in the past that legal change is not enough.

147
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,400
We have to change the culture.

148
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,560
I realize they get a little too passionate about this sometimes,

149
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,520
but we all have an obligation to do nothing less than change the culture in this country.

150
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,320
That's just the laws.

151
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,200
We change the laws, change the culture.

152
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,000
So if culture can be changed and it's not an immutable characteristic,

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,360
why should it be protected?

154
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,280
Why should the excuse of it's my culture be valid within leftist thought?

155
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,360
What about thin privilege and fat oppression?

156
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,520
The intersection of left loves that stuff, but you can literally just lose the weight.

157
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,000
We know for a fact that with the exception of the most extreme circumstances,

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,520
the rarest of the rare cases, body weight is not immutable.

159
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,680
And to get back to the trans question, according to at least some trans activists,

160
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,840
because gender isn't immutable as well, then it also doesn't count.

161
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,080
But very clearly, they don't view it this way.

162
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,600
They don't seem to exclude things based on whether or not they're immutable,

163
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,920
even though that is certainly how they present the issue.

164
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,600
It seems to me that they exclude things arbitrarily from intersectional theory.

165
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,160
They exclude things based on political expedience.

166
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,640
But if you were to be an honest intersectionalist,

167
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,920
and you did not exclude things solely for political reasons,

168
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,360
but included into the theory everything, every part of your personality,

169
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,280
you would very quickly realize two things.

170
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,480
One, the intersectionality becomes entirely useless in day-to-day life,

171
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,080
because there is no way you can even collect enough information

172
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,840
about every single person that you meet

173
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,320
in order to properly fractionate all of their identities,

174
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,720
let alone actually be able to do the math on that.

175
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,440
And two, you would also very quickly realize

176
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,760
that if you ever were to actually do that, you would arrive at an individual.

177
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,160
And I think this is what some of the libertarian thinkers mean

178
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,760
when they say that the individual is the greatest minority of all,

179
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,360
because there is only one individual against an entire society.

180
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,520
And it is because if you were to actually work through the infinite math

181
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,200
that is intersectionality, you would arrive at a completely unique person.

182
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,920
I may demographically be like you in some ways,

183
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,000
but no matter how similar we are,

184
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,840
if we were to add up every single data point of our lives and then compare them,

185
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,680
eventually we would come across a difference,

186
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,440
and that would be what makes us individuals.

187
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,840
So even though intersectionality is correct,

188
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,400
individuality solves the problem of intersectionality,

189
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,440
and it does it in a much more efficient and less oppressive way.

190
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,960
Another thing that the radical left is right about is the problem of inequality.

191
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,040
Inequality is a real problem.

192
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,720
Too much inequality does in fact destabilize societies.

193
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,520
If you have an entire 99% of people who live in abject poverty,

194
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,160
and you have a 1% of people that lives high constantly with no middle class,

195
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,560
if there is no legitimate way for advancement, then why wouldn't the people revolt?

196
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,200
I mean, if they upend the entire thing,

197
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,040
maybe they'll be back in the exact same position,

198
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,360
but maybe they'll be in the 1% this time, who knows?

199
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,480
We do know that at least some level of inequality is required to have an economy.

200
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,400
That is because an economy is simply individuals acting freely.

201
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,480
Therefore you have some individuals who are inclined to constantly work.

202
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,560
It's just in their personality to work like 20 hour days,

203
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,800
7 days a week for 50 years,

204
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,680
and therefore they generate a disproportionate amount of production

205
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
and gain a disproportionate amount of wealth.

206
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,200
Freedom means not only the freedom to work or not work,

207
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,520
it also means the freedom to work at what you like.

208
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,960
Some careers will be more useful and therefore more lucrative,

209
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,400
and freedom means the freedom to choose a career that might not pay as much.

210
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,480
Freedom means the freedom to fail,

211
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,240
or it means the freedom to succeed but to do so sub-optimally.

212
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,400
If it takes you 6 years to get a 4 year degree, you're 2 years behind,

213
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,320
and those people who got the degree in 4 years,

214
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,400
well they have the freedom to get it in 4 years,

215
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
and you have the freedom to get it in 6.

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,480
Freedom does mean the freedom to make mistakes.

217
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,280
All of these freedoms mean that people are basically allowed to work at their pace.

218
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,560
They still have to maintain themselves,

219
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,640
they still have to like pay for their food and stuff,

220
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
because their own maintenance is their own responsibility.

221
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,320
But for all that stuff that is above and beyond,

222
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,720
people are free to go for it or not.

223
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,840
And it is that difference,

224
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,560
it is that inequality in personality that generates inequality in the market.

225
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
It generates inequality of income,

226
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,240
it generates inequality of status,

227
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,760
it generates inequality of wealth.

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,320
You do this for a few generations, you have an economy.

229
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,080
So we do need inequality to generate wealth,

230
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,600
and to keep society running.

231
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,520
But you can't have too much inequality,

232
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,920
such that those in the bottom who would actually want to try to work their way up,

233
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
have no meaningful path to do so.

234
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,080
Because if there is no meaningful path to do so,

235
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,920
then they will destroy the system in an attempt to make a meaningful path to do so.

236
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,480
The people on the left throw around this African proverb,

237
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,280
those who are excluded from the village will burn it to feel its warmth.

238
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,520
And that is true on some level.

239
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,600
People will do what they want to do.

240
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,240
If there is a legal, non-violent option for them to do what they want, they'll take it.

241
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,480
If there isn't one, then they'll risk it.

242
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,840
So if a society truly does have growing inequality,

243
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
that's a problem that needs to be solved.

244
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,720
And the issue that we're having is that we don't quite know how to solve it.

245
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,160
The left's ideas regarding these redistribution schemes,

246
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,880
and you know like UBI or high taxes, whatever,

247
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,680
that stuff doesn't seem to work long term.

248
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,560
We don't know what to do about the problem of equality.

249
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,600
The left's ideas don't work, and the right's idea of

250
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,040
let's ignore it, it's not a real problem, is asinine.

251
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,120
Now we're getting deep into the Neo-Marxism because this kind of connects very nicely

252
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,280
with the idea that structures are oppressive.

253
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,320
And yes they are.

254
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,520
The left is right about that too.

255
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,760
A structure is oppressive.

256
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,080
It's oppressive to those within it, and it is especially oppressive to those who are not in it.

257
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,320
Hierarchies are inherently tyrannical,

258
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,800
unless you are of course at the very top of the hierarchy.

259
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,200
But the radical left's reply, you know,

260
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,800
destroy all hierarchy, destroy the structures of society,

261
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
that is even worse, because then you have nothing.

262
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,480
Maybe they prefer nothing, you know.

263
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,760
Maybe there are some people on the left who are more predisposed to enjoy chaos,

264
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,360
while there are some people on the right who are more predisposed to enjoy tyrannical order,

265
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
even if they are ground under the boot of it.

266
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,800
But even though structures are oppressive, you can't simply take away the structure.

267
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,720
Structures are what orient you in the world, at least in some way.

268
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,240
Going back to the degree example, if you and I are getting the same degree,

269
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,800
you get it in four years, and I get it in six years,

270
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,800
and the reason I took two extra years is because I kept failing classes,

271
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,320
or I had to take less classes because I didn't have the money, you know, whatever,

272
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,160
then yes, the university structure is in some way oppressing me.

273
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,000
There are things about my life that I have to deal with that you don't.

274
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,360
There are problems that I have that are preventing me from graduating on time,

275
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,480
and therefore the standards that I have to reach in order to get this degree,

276
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
even though they're the same standard between us,

277
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,840
they're harder for me to reach due to these extra circumstances.

278
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,440
So the structure would be oppressing me more than it's oppressing you in that case.

279
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,320
But that oppression is, it's a necessary part in human advancement.

280
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,880
If there is no chance of failing something, then the success means nothing.

281
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,640
Personal growth comes not only through victory, but through defeat.

282
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,600
Sometimes you have to be destroyed so that you can be rebuilt.

283
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,560
That's the whole walking through the fire analogy.

284
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,640
You don't get to do that unscathed.

285
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,280
Some parts of you will burn off, and that is a painful process to be sure,

286
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,600
but it's what's left after that process that's important.

287
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,960
So yes, the structures of society are inherently oppressive,

288
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,720
but that is because they have standards and they judge you for not reaching them.

289
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,560
I mean, how many times have you seen some

290
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,360
self-centered person scream something like don't judge me?

291
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,840
But the idea of a judge is that it is not only the thing that judges you,

292
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,760
it is the thing that you aspire to be.

293
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,640
That's why, for example, when you get a new job and you want to go in

294
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,600
and make a good first impression with the new boss,

295
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,720
yes, you are being judged and you're usually nervous about it,

296
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,240
but you're also looking to do a good job.

297
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,080
You're looking to climb the hierarchy here.

298
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,400
The thing that judges you as either worthy or unworthy is also the thing

299
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,920
that you are aspiring to become yourself through your own work.

300
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,120
I think the religious folks really understand the purpose of judgment,

301
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,920
at least some of them.

302
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,480
There's always going to be some crazies out there,

303
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,800
those people who simply use religion as a method by which they abuse other people,

304
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,360
but at least the honest religious folk out there understand

305
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,560
that judgment is not meant to make you feel oppressed.

306
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,720
That is a side effect that can't be avoided.

307
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,800
Judgment is the crucible in which you are made and you really aren't you.

308
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,440
Like the current person that you are right now, that's not you.

309
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,760
You were very different earlier in your life

310
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,480
and you will be very different in the next five to 10 years.

311
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,520
You are not your current personality or your current ambitions

312
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,080
or your current property, your current location, your current job.

313
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,040
You're not any of that.

314
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,120
You are what's left after you walk through the fire.

315
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,440
You are what's left after you go through the crucible.

316
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,320
You are what's left after you are judged

317
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,240
and then those things about you that are insufficient have to go away

318
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,680
and then you build a different life.

319
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,680
You are the thing that exists between multiple iterations of yourself

320
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,960
and that cannot happen unless you have some kind of oppressive structure

321
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,000
with which you can discipline yourself within.

322
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,920
And I think that's why a lot of the people who complain about judgment

323
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,800
or who complain about structures being inherently oppressive,

324
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,440
they're like 35 year old man-children because they've never changed.

325
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,520
They've never shaped themselves into anything beyond what they were when they were 14.

326
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,200
Of course the big answer on the left to this whole thing is that nothing has inherent value

327
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
and again the left is correct.

328
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,720
Nothing has inherent value.

329
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,200
I think this is what causes a lot of nihilism in people when they kind of realize that,

330
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,400
let's be honest, religion isn't really real.

331
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,000
God probably doesn't exist.

332
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,560
There is probably nothing after death but the void

333
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,280
and that reality does not care about you one way or another.

334
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,960
There is an entire material universe out there that you will never experience.

335
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,040
You will likely never leave this planet

336
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,800
and when you are gone all of those stars and planets out there will keep spinning

337
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,320
as if you never existed.

338
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,640
Reality really doesn't have a moral arc.

339
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Things do not have inherent value.

340
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,800
The post-modernists on the radical left are completely correct in this

341
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,280
and that is fundamentally what fuels their nihilism.

342
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,480
That's what fuels their desire to become Marxists because if there is nothing metaphysical,

343
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,040
if there really is only darkness out there,

344
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
then a person like that would probably

345
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,880
1. be completely invested in the pleasure principle,

346
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,400
simply acting in a way that is purely selfish and feels the best for the time

347
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,480
and avoiding as much pain as they can

348
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,000
and 2. desire a society that will allow them to do that no matter what

349
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,240
because if there's no inherent value then there's no ideal to strive towards

350
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,360
and if all you have left is impulsive pleasure seeking

351
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,480
in order to try and stave off the fear of death

352
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,800
then all of society should be structured around that,

353
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,720
hence the communist utopia.

354
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,240
It really is like a baby's first nihilism kind of philosophy

355
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,400
and I went through that phase myself at least a little bit

356
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,680
but I kind of figured out very quickly that kind of impulsive pleasure seeking

357
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,480
was fun for a little bit but it rapidly made things worse

358
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,360
and that the gift of nihilism is not that things have no inherent meaning

359
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,840
and therefore we should all simply inject heroin and jack our brains up

360
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,080
to feel nothing but pleasure until we inevitably die

361
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,280
but rather that because things have no inherent value

362
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,280
that means that I can assign value to them as a free thinking person.

363
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,400
I can value my girlfriend because of the relationship we have,

364
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,680
not because she has any inherent value as far as the universe is concerned

365
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,440
but because of what she means to me.

366
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
I can find the people in my life valuable

367
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,520
or I can find new people to find valuable if the ones around me aren't really worth it.

368
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,000
I can find value in the stuff that I build even if I know that one day it will be gone.

369
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,240
I can find value in the people that I help

370
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,600
even if I know that one day I'll be gone and so will they.

371
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,480
If you can alleviate some of the unnecessary suffering in life

372
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,720
that might not have any inherent value but it can certainly have value to you.

373
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,840
You would have to basically be a sociopath to not like

374
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,080
enjoy the feeling that you get when you've bought someone a birthday gift for example

375
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,840
and it's exactly what they want and they unwrap it and they're ecstatic.

376
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,480
These things don't have inherent value but based on your own personality

377
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,280
you can definitely find things that have value to you

378
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,880
and if you're a well-rounded person that will be enough to carry you forward through your life.

379
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,480
Of course if you're underdeveloped then it won't.

380
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,960
I've noticed that people on the left they like to say that it's the far right,

381
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
it's the alt-right, they're destroying society right now.

382
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,800
People on the right say the same thing about the left,

383
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,440
they call them leftists, liberals, marxists, whatever.

384
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,040
My point is is that it's neither.

385
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,200
We need both liberalism and conservatism but not only do we need them,

386
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,000
we can never actually rid ourselves of one or the other.

387
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,840
There will always be personality types that are more suited to liberal thought.

388
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,200
There will always be personality types that are more suited to conservative thought.

389
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,360
And liberals and conservatives both bring different yet useful things to the table.

390
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,640
Liberals often have personality types that make them more open to new experiences, more creative.

391
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,280
They're not just our society's artists but also our engineers.

392
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,880
They come up with the new ideas.

393
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,760
Meanwhile conservatives have personality types that lend them more to be organizers.

394
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,680
They might not invent the next big thing but they will definitely optimize it.

395
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,920
The liberals and the conservatives are two essential cogs in the machine.

396
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,200
If you remove either of them the entire thing falls apart.

397
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,680
You need both and you need them both working together.

398
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,520
So as a centrist it's important to understand what the left actually gets right

399
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,560
and not simply throw the baby out with the bathwater.

400
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,800
All right that about does it for me.

401
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,400
I'll talk to you guys soon.

402
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,920
I love you.
