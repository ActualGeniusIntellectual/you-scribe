1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
We've all seen images like this before.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,220
These are media ecosystem maps, showing that the broader left-wing and right-wing exist

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,900
in their own media bubbles.

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,620
What this means is, if you're a left-wing person, you're much more likely to encounter

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,060
media and opinions online that reinforce your worldview, and you rarely have that view challenged.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,420
Same with right-wing people in their own bubble.

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,200
As a result, a story might go viral in one sphere, and barely even be noticed in another.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,300
This past week, two very similar stories went viral around the same time.

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,620
One of them commented heavily on by right-leaning people, and virtually ignored by the left,

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,600
and the other, the inverse, commented heavily on by left-leaning people, and virtually ignored

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
by the right.

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,160
So, let's take a look at them both.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,720
Firstly, the right-wing story.

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,040
A video clip went viral of two teenagers in a stolen car, ramming into a cyclist in Las

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
Vegas.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,540
I'm not going to play the whole clip because I don't want my channel to get nuked, but

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,180
basically, these kids are laughing, speeding by other drivers.

18
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,660
One yells at the other hit him, they ram into his back, he shatters the windshield, and

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,300
then falls onto the road.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,020
The two kids laugh about how hard he got hit, and then exclaim that they gotta get out of

21
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,540
there before they get caught.

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,320
The video was taken from the passenger seat, so it was quite nice of these idiots to record

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,720
proof of them committing a murder.

24
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,060
The event happened back on August 14th, but the story only hit the current news cycle

25
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,780
after the video clip went viral on September 15th, presumably shortly after the two were

26
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,780
arrested.

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,460
Jesus Ayala had just turned 18, Jasmir Keyes was 16.

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,220
Ayala seemed to be under the impression that he was still a juvenile, saying to the police,

29
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,060
you think this juvenile is going to do some time?

30
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,140
I'll be out in 30 days, I bet you.

31
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,060
And it's just a hit and run, slap on the wrist.

32
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,980
Ayala had not been informed of any hit and run charges against him when he made these

33
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,980
statements.

34
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,080
The police were only there to arrest him under a prior warrant.

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,120
These statements and the video footage allowed the cops to slap him with 18 charges, including

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,440
murder, attempted murder, and grand larceny.

37
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,760
Ayala's mother apologized for her son's actions, saying through a translator, I don't

38
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,160
know if God can forgive him.

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,000
And yeah, despite Ayala clearly being Latino, his booking paperwork shows that the police

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,280
filed him as white.

41
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,120
Jasmir Keyes was arrested on a different day and had a different appearance in court from

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,160
his friend, and I wasn't able to dig up what charges he even slapped with.

43
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,540
But despite being 16, he's also being charged as an adult.

44
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,100
Keyes' mother was not apologetic like Ayala's was, saying that her son's true story will

45
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,100
come out, not these media false representations.

46
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,060
The investigation eventually uncovered that on that same day, these guys stole three vehicles

47
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,940
in total, hit the one guy, tried to hit another, and also committed a burglary.

48
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,420
The man that was killed was a retired police chief, Andreas Probst.

49
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,740
How do you pronounce that name?

50
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,740
Probst?

51
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,940
It's a horrible story, but it's also a really simple case.

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,720
Two idiot kids went for a joyride and racked up a huge list of charges.

53
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,960
Multiple car thefts, murder, attempted murder, it's like it's Grand Theft Auto over here.

54
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,920
They've got physical evidence, video evidence.

55
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,320
Ayala was stupid enough to open his dumb fuck mouth when he was being arrested.

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,140
This is an open and shut case.

57
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,320
As always, wait for the trial, who knows, maybe some weird evidence might come out or

58
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,120
something, but as it currently stands, I feel pretty confident that justice will be done

59
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
here.

60
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
The evidence is just that overwhelming.

61
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,640
The point is, though, this story only went viral within right-wing social media circles.

62
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,580
I follow a healthy amount of lefties online, and almost none of them are talking about

63
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,580
it.

64
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,780
The few that were were these fringe revolutionary ACAB types saying that Probst deserved it

65
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,420
because he was a cop, and that he's also corrupt because he took a disability pension

66
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,340
that was under legal scrutiny back in 2011, making these kids heroes for purging a corrupt

67
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,340
pig or something like that.

68
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,740
Though I want to make it very clear, that opinion was only expressed by a very fringe

69
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,540
minority of the online left.

70
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,260
The majority of leftists just seem to be ignorant that this event even happened.

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Now let's take a look at the left-wing story.

72
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,000
A video clip went viral of a Seattle police officer responding to an emergency call.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,800
He was speeding to the scene, doing 74 miles in a 25-mile-per-hour area, which cops are

74
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,160
allowed to do, but he didn't have his lights or his siren on, failing to alert himself

75
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,640
to everyone else on the road.

76
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,480
Just like last time, this is footage of a death, so I'm not going to show the whole

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,480
clip.

78
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,160
He rams into a woman walking down the street, in pretty much the same way as the previous

79
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
story.

80
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,560
She hit the passenger side windshield and died.

81
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,140
Afterward, he pulls over and reports the incident to dispatch, with a particularly disinterested

82
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:32,620
and annoyed tone in his voice, like this is some inconvenience for him.

83
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,340
Later on in the clip, he's caught laughing to somebody on the phone about the incident,

84
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,040
allegedly someone from the police union, remarking that she was just a regular person

85
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,920
who had limited value, and that the city should just cut her family an $11,000 check to make

86
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
it up to them.

87
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:20,040
This event happened back on January 23rd, but was mostly ignored by social media until

88
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,080
the body cam footage of the officer laughing at the woman's death was released on September

89
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
12th.

90
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,680
The woman he killed was Janavi Kandula, an Indian immigrant to the US, and a graduate

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
student at Northeastern University.

92
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,920
She was just finishing up her master's degree in information systems.

93
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,660
The officer is Kevin Dave, who still works for the Seattle Police Department.

94
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,680
Though after the body cam footage went public, the Seattle Police announced they were auditing

95
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,220
his actions, and the county prosecuting attorney announced a criminal review of the incident.

96
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,220
Despite Dave's initial lack of remorse, he publicly remarked in July that he fucked

97
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,360
up, which is, you know, putting it mildly.

98
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,540
This is also a horrible story, but again, it's a simple case.

99
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,160
The officer was blasting down the road at three times the speed limit without his lights

100
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,340
or sirens on, and he hit someone, and then he has the audacity to act like it wasn't

101
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,660
a big deal afterwards.

102
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,020
Could that have been not a true expression of heartlessness, but rather a trauma response

103
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,020
for him?

104
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,020
Maybe.

105
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,020
But the best case scenario for Dave is that he was really shook up and said some dumb

106
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,000
shit without thinking it through, and none of that makes him innocent.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He still did it.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,060
Hey, this is Future Dev, recording this during editing.

109
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,360
Even though every online source that I could find about this story says that the officer

110
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,100
who hit the pedestrian and the officer who was caught making callous remarks on his body

111
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,440
cam were the same officer, they might not be.

112
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,820
While editing this video, I noticed that the two body cam feeds have a different serial

113
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,820
number.

114
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,420
That might mean that this is two different officers with two different cameras.

115
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,860
However, most mainstream articles haven't pointed out that these are two different officers.

116
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,160
Alright, I just went and checked.

117
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,320
In between my writing this script a few days ago and editing it today, the contents of

118
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,340
a lot of these articles started getting changed.

119
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,780
These outlets are correcting the record.

120
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,620
This shouldn't really change the content of this video though, because this isn't about

121
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,260
the stories themselves.

122
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,180
It's about media bubbles and people's reaction to the stories.

123
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,640
Anyway, let's get back to it.

124
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,140
This story only went viral within left-wing social media circles.

125
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,140
I also follow a healthy amount of righties online, and almost none of them were talking

126
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,140
about it either.

127
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,520
The few that did were these fringe white nationalist types, making jokes about India and talking

128
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,020
about removing all the immigrants, and there was even less of these guys than the revolutionary

129
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,060
ACAB people cheering the death of Andreas Probst in the other story.

130
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,220
The vast majority of right-wingers just seemed to not know what was happening at all.

131
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,220
So we know that both of these stories didn't really have any reach across the political

132
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,220
aisle.

133
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,380
But how did each camp respond to their own story?

134
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,020
Well, the right-wing response to their story was frankly pretty much all talk.

135
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,140
Lots of people going on about how much society is decaying, civilization is collapsing, the

136
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,260
government is inept.

137
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,880
Some people were making it explicitly about race, since one of the two drivers was black

138
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,880
and the other Latino.

139
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,740
No, I don't care what the police report says, fuck you.

140
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,860
While the victim was white.

141
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,700
There was also a fair bit of falsehood mixed in with the truth.

142
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,560
For example, Elon Musk posted this article from the Las Vegas Review with the headline

143
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,060
''Retired police chief killed in bike crash, remembered for laugh and love of coffee.''

144
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,860
With his added reaction, ''An innocent man was murdered in cold blood while riding his

145
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,860
bicycle.

146
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,540
The killers joked about it on social media.

147
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,080
Yet where is the media outrage?

148
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,740
Now you begin to understand the lie.''

149
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,260
The implication here is that the headline was purposely crafted to obscure the fact

150
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,860
that Probst was killed by calling it a bike crash.

151
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,860
I understand this reaction.

152
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,340
We all remember when the Washington Post called the leader of ISIS an ''austere religious

153
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,340
scholar''.

154
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
But this time, it's actually wrong.

155
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,940
The article in question was published on August 18th, only a few days after the event, long

156
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,700
before anyone knew what actually happened.

157
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,380
A subsequent article published on August 31st, after the media had viewed the video footage,

158
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,940
explicitly outlines the hit and run.

159
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,940
Thanks, Community Notes.

160
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,420
You continue to help everybody out, even if it means shitting on Elon in the process.

161
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,180
Everyone's favorite culture warrior, Ian Miles-Chiang, showed up with this video clip

162
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,500
from a press conference discussing the event.

163
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,940
We believe that Andy's murder is a direct result of society's decayed family values

164
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,400
and the strong effects that social media has on our youth.

165
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,420
We as a family in no way feel that Andy's murder was based on race or profession.

166
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,240
It was a random act of violence.

167
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,380
We ask you to not politicize or use Andy's murder to fuel political agendas or to create

168
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,380
cultural wars.

169
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,900
I don't know about you, but I don't think his description of this clip as ''prope's

170
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,820
daughter'' doesn't blame the assailants, holds social media responsible, and her devotion

171
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,860
to diversity is unshaken is an accurate description.

172
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,540
In fact, that sounds like spin.

173
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,540
It's pretty reasonable to assume that this wasn't a targeted attack against white people.

174
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,660
It was two joyriding retards who were sociopathic enough to think that hitting somebody constitutes

175
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,660
fun.

176
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,700
If it were a non-white cyclist, I have no doubt they would have also run him down for

177
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,700
their laughs.

178
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,660
The opposite of this claim, that it's somehow this racially-motivated anti-white attack,

179
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,620
is Tariq Nasheed's take, who came out and said that the two were actually white Hispanics,

180
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,500
making this a case of white-on-white crime.

181
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,900
These people are all just retarded.

182
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,900
Most of the right-wing reactions appealed to the same sentiment that Elon did when he

183
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,160
asked ''where is the media outrage?''

184
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,420
There were lots of people saying where's the outrage, in fact.

185
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,660
An editorial on the New York Post titled ''Andreas Prope's Murder Shows Lefty Media's Willful

186
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,620
Blindspots'' states that ''The crime is so violent, so nihilistic, one would expect a

187
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,120
national spotlight on it, yet that simply hasn't happened in the month since the killing.''

188
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,500
The New York Times, the Washington Post, and CNN are all in the wind.

189
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,020
This appears to be mostly true.

190
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,780
As of the making of this video, neither the New York Times or CNN have reported on this

191
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,180
event as far as I can tell.

192
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:35,540
The Washington Post did publish an article one day after the New York Post lambasted

193
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,940
them for ignoring the story, but framed it in the context of the hate mob that Elon Musk

194
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,780
apparently sent towards the Las Vegas Review for the seemingly inaccurate headline.

195
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,100
Same thing with the Seattle Times.

196
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,940
In fact, most of the news outlets reporting on this event are right-wing ones, like the

197
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,500
New York Post or the Daily Mail.

198
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,640
Though Huffington Post, to their credit, is one left-wing outlet that wasn't afraid to

199
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
tackle the issue.

200
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,700
However, when people ask ''where's the outrage?''

201
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,380
They're not just talking about ''where's the media coverage?''

202
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,860
They're also asking ''where's the public statements by politicians?''

203
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,940
''Where's the protests and the riots and the marches and the chanting in front of the

204
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,940
government buildings?''

205
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,580
''Where's the acceptance of the victim as the next cultural martyr?''

206
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,780
''Where's the national days of mourning or the statues or whatever else?''

207
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,660
What they're basically asking is, why isn't Andreas Probst being treated like George Floyd?

208
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,740
They're both victims and Probst is certainly a better man of character than Floyd was.

209
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,860
And the conclusion that people on the right-wing come to is, it's because Probst is white and

210
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,380
white victims make bad martyrs.

211
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,500
Sometimes their conclusion is that the perpetrators are non-white, but most of the time it's that

212
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,100
the victim is white and the cathedral does not commemorate white victims.

213
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,820
That is the right-wing view of the situation.

214
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,660
At the same time though, all of those right-wing people who were outraged, they only seemed

215
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,220
to be outraged online.

216
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,300
As far as I can tell, they didn't get together to march on City Hall or anything like that.

217
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,100
But the people outraged at the left-wing story, they absolutely did.

218
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,600
Now it is true that there absolutely was more of a mainstream media reaction to the killing

219
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,020
of Jovani Kadula, CNN, Washington Post, NBC, New York Times.

220
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,300
But there was also a larger grassroots response as well.

221
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,220
Online petitions, protests, marches in a bunch of major American cities.

222
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,260
Did the mainstream media response only happen because of the grassroots activism putting

223
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
them into the story?

224
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,420
That's possible.

225
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,240
Leftists do tend to do more on-the-ground marches and activism than rightists.

226
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,420
The leftist tendency to protest and riot in real life might have been the driving factor

227
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,420
here.

228
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,340
Or did the mainstream media response cause that grassroots activism by pushing the story

229
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,340
into the news cycle?

230
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,500
That's also very possible.

231
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,420
It might be the case that there was no real-life outrage over the Probst killing because of

232
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,140
a media failure in comparison to the media shining their spotlight on the Kadula killing.

233
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,140
It's hard to tell.

234
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,820
The earliest tweets about the Kadula story from this news cycle are from around the same

235
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,200
time as the earliest articles were published.

236
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,580
So we don't really know whether the chicken or the egg came first.

237
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,300
Could it be because of the stories themselves?

238
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,720
The first is about two non-white youths driving around in a stolen car and killing a random

239
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,600
white guy for kicks, who just happened to be a retired cop.

240
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,220
It doesn't seem like they killed him because he was white and they didn't know he was

241
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,220
a cop.

242
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,580
But those two things are absolutely factors in choosing not to report on the story if

243
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,720
the outlet in question is biased towards the left.

244
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,540
The second story is about a cop killing a brown female student immigrant and going viral

245
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,100
for showing no remorse about his actions.

246
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,420
Now the demographics have switched places, and the left, being very anti-cop and very

247
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,020
pro-immigrant, is much more inclined to report on the story.

248
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,700
Otherwise, these stories are pretty identical, killing an innocent with a car and showing

249
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,940
an extreme lack of remorse for doing so.

250
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,620
The issue, ultimately, is that the right-leaning media reported on both stories while the left-leaning

251
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,900
media only reported on the story that favored their politics.

252
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,800
That's actually a very serious problem, and why you need to consume news from across

253
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
the political spectrum.

254
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,760
No, you can't only consume right-wing media just because they report on both stories.

255
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,240
They still put spins on stories that don't suit their interests.

256
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,980
Fox News is legendary for that.

257
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,900
You cannot remain in those echo chambers that I started the video off talking about and

258
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,860
somehow still call yourself informed.

259
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,660
Yeah, right-wing media might have reported on both of these stories while left-wing media

260
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
didn't.

261
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,660
And that's bad.

262
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,400
At least, the average leftoid has an excuse to only get outraged over one story.

263
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,740
They exist in a news bubble that doesn't allow them to learn about the other one.

264
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,980
Your average rightoid, reading their own media sources, had the opportunity to learn about

265
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,420
both tragedies, and nonetheless, they still only focus their online outrage towards the

266
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,220
one that suited their political views better.

267
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:26,140
When I look at this picture, I see not only two news bubbles that have limited overlap,

268
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,380
but two fundamentally different views of reality.

269
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,260
It's important to understand that when somebody has a true belief about the world, that's

270
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,700
not some theory for them.

271
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,860
That's how reality actually looks from their point of view.

272
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,100
Let me give you an example.

273
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,660
Let's say that I'm accused of murder.

274
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,900
The police find some physical evidence of me at the crime scene.

275
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,820
There's some fingerprints, there's my hair or something.

276
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,980
Now let's say in reality, the objective truth is that I didn't actually murder the

277
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,980
guy.

278
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,500
I just happened to walk through the area two minutes before.

279
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,420
Most other people, not knowing my experiences because they didn't live them, will believe

280
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,580
that I'm the murderer.

281
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,700
And from their point of view, the story of reality will read that I killed somebody and

282
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,700
got away with it.

283
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,300
From my point of view, people treating me coldly due to their belief will appear insane

284
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,460
to me because my reading of the story of reality says that I'm innocent.

285
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,340
We both have different beliefs about what reality is, but those beliefs don't feel

286
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,660
like beliefs from the point of view of the believer.

287
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,340
They feel like reality itself.

288
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,700
So, to the rightoid who is in their media bubble, the story of reality reads like nobody

289
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,620
gives a shit about two non-white kids callously running down a retired white cop.

290
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,780
Because nobody's out there protesting, nobody's rioting, nobody's starting social movements,

291
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,860
nobody's reporting on it in the mainstream media.

292
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,560
While to the leftoids who are in their media bubble, the story of reality reads like nobody

293
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,860
gives a shit about a young immigrant woman who is callously run down by a cop because

294
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,620
it's taken six months and a possible body cam leak to the media to even get an investigation

295
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,660
off the ground.

296
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,260
Which belief is the actual reality?

297
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,600
It's probably a bit of both.

298
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,300
As unsatisfying an answer as that is.

299
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,020
But it is undeniable that in this case, the left-leaning media dropped the ball on covering

300
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,900
the right story, while at the same time, right-leaning people had more of an opportunity to care

301
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,400
about the left story and still failed to do so.

302
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,400
This kind of reminds me of the train derailment situation in Palestine, Ohio at the start

303
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
of the year.

304
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,940
People were screaming about how it wasn't going viral and no one's talking about it.

305
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,080
When before it went viral on Twitter, CNN and other news outlets actually were publishing

306
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
articles about the event.

307
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,120
It's just that nobody cared until that one dude stood underneath that unnaturally

308
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,500
darkened sky and yelled that there was an emergency happening and nobody was paying

309
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
attention to them.

310
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,360
Maybe it really is one of those type of things, where if you want an event to get attention,

311
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,040
you gotta make way more noise, both online and offline.

312
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Or maybe it's a media failure.

313
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,520
Again, probably a bit of both.

314
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,640
Oh well, I can't change any institutions, and I certainly can't change large swaths

315
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
of individuals.

316
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,360
I'm just a random, overweight nerd.

317
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,040
It's just you and me here right now.

318
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,720
So I'll leave you with a bit of advice.

319
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,080
Push yourself to step outside of your wheelhouse and consume ideas that you wouldn't naturally

320
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,240
gravitate towards.

321
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,200
The algorithm wants to push you content pre-made for you.

322
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,960
Resist that and seek something you wouldn't normally enjoy.

323
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,880
If you refuse to read a specific news outlet due to its partisan nature, start reading

324
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,880
it.

325
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,240
You're smart enough to cut through their bullshit on your own.

326
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,480
You don't need to avoid them.

327
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,240
And yes, this applies to both sides.

328
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,560
We all know about the crying leftoid snowflakes who block everyone on social media and they

329
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,960
desperately want to make the entire world their safe space where they don't have to

330
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,960
suffer any pushback for their dogshit socialist arguments, who think that you're literally

331
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,080
killing trannies by using the wrong pronouns and all that retarded shit.

332
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,000
But do you think the right doesn't do that too?

333
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,360
I'm a co-host on the ArchCast with my friend ArchWarhammer.

334
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,720
He's way more right-wing than me by far, while his audience is way further right than

335
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
either of us.

336
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,840
His chat is full of libertarians and ancaps, and I'm considered a communist over there.

337
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,720
And whenever I show up, there's that small vocal contingent of people who begin to scream

338
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,760
that they can't handle me being here, they can't watch the show anymore, they gotta

339
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,940
unsub, they can't take hearing opinions they disagree with.

340
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,860
These guys are just snowflakes.

341
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,540
They're right-wing snowflakes in a right-wing safe space, just like the leftoids.

342
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,100
And in both cases, these people are intellectually stunted.

343
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,700
They have no response to being challenged other than to soy out.

344
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,940
You've all got a little bit of snowflake inside of us, guys.

345
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,580
It is uncomfortable to be pushed back on, I get it.

346
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:06,620
But part of growing up is killing the snowflake and accepting that people you really disagree

347
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,700
with do actually have some good points worth hearing.

348
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,500
Anyway, that's all for me today, guys.

349
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,700
Naomi and I watched that god-fucking-awful Stray's movie, so check that vlog out.

350
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,580
I'll also be streaming tonight, so come say hello.

351
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,700
Okay, I'll see you guys next time.

352
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,140
I love you.
