0	8160	We've all seen images like this before.
8160	13220	These are media ecosystem maps, showing that the broader left-wing and right-wing exist
13220	14900	in their own media bubbles.
14900	18620	What this means is, if you're a left-wing person, you're much more likely to encounter
18620	24060	media and opinions online that reinforce your worldview, and you rarely have that view challenged.
24060	26420	Same with right-wing people in their own bubble.
26420	31200	As a result, a story might go viral in one sphere, and barely even be noticed in another.
31200	35300	This past week, two very similar stories went viral around the same time.
35300	39620	One of them commented heavily on by right-leaning people, and virtually ignored by the left,
39620	43600	and the other, the inverse, commented heavily on by left-leaning people, and virtually ignored
43600	44600	by the right.
44600	46160	So, let's take a look at them both.
46160	47720	Firstly, the right-wing story.
47720	53040	A video clip went viral of two teenagers in a stolen car, ramming into a cyclist in Las
53040	54040	Vegas.
54040	56540	I'm not going to play the whole clip because I don't want my channel to get nuked, but
56540	60180	basically, these kids are laughing, speeding by other drivers.
60180	63660	One yells at the other hit him, they ram into his back, he shatters the windshield, and
63660	67300	then falls onto the road.
67300	71020	The two kids laugh about how hard he got hit, and then exclaim that they gotta get out of
71020	75540	there before they get caught.
75540	79320	The video was taken from the passenger seat, so it was quite nice of these idiots to record
79320	80720	proof of them committing a murder.
80720	85060	The event happened back on August 14th, but the story only hit the current news cycle
85060	89780	after the video clip went viral on September 15th, presumably shortly after the two were
89780	90780	arrested.
90780	94460	Jesus Ayala had just turned 18, Jasmir Keyes was 16.
94460	98220	Ayala seemed to be under the impression that he was still a juvenile, saying to the police,
98220	100060	you think this juvenile is going to do some time?
100060	102140	I'll be out in 30 days, I bet you.
102140	104060	And it's just a hit and run, slap on the wrist.
104060	108980	Ayala had not been informed of any hit and run charges against him when he made these
108980	109980	statements.
110240	113080	The police were only there to arrest him under a prior warrant.
113080	118120	These statements and the video footage allowed the cops to slap him with 18 charges, including
118120	120440	murder, attempted murder, and grand larceny.
120440	124760	Ayala's mother apologized for her son's actions, saying through a translator, I don't
124760	126160	know if God can forgive him.
126160	130000	And yeah, despite Ayala clearly being Latino, his booking paperwork shows that the police
130000	131280	filed him as white.
131280	135120	Jasmir Keyes was arrested on a different day and had a different appearance in court from
135120	138160	his friend, and I wasn't able to dig up what charges he even slapped with.
138180	141540	But despite being 16, he's also being charged as an adult.
141540	146100	Keyes' mother was not apologetic like Ayala's was, saying that her son's true story will
146100	149100	come out, not these media false representations.
149100	154060	The investigation eventually uncovered that on that same day, these guys stole three vehicles
154060	157940	in total, hit the one guy, tried to hit another, and also committed a burglary.
157940	161420	The man that was killed was a retired police chief, Andreas Probst.
161420	162740	How do you pronounce that name?
162740	163740	Probst?
163740	165940	It's a horrible story, but it's also a really simple case.
165960	169720	Two idiot kids went for a joyride and racked up a huge list of charges.
169720	172960	Multiple car thefts, murder, attempted murder, it's like it's Grand Theft Auto over here.
172960	174920	They've got physical evidence, video evidence.
174920	178320	Ayala was stupid enough to open his dumb fuck mouth when he was being arrested.
178320	180140	This is an open and shut case.
180140	183320	As always, wait for the trial, who knows, maybe some weird evidence might come out or
183320	187120	something, but as it currently stands, I feel pretty confident that justice will be done
187120	188120	here.
188120	189120	The evidence is just that overwhelming.
189120	193640	The point is, though, this story only went viral within right-wing social media circles.
193660	197580	I follow a healthy amount of lefties online, and almost none of them are talking about
197580	198580	it.
198580	202780	The few that were were these fringe revolutionary ACAB types saying that Probst deserved it
202780	206420	because he was a cop, and that he's also corrupt because he took a disability pension
206420	211340	that was under legal scrutiny back in 2011, making these kids heroes for purging a corrupt
211340	212340	pig or something like that.
212340	216740	Though I want to make it very clear, that opinion was only expressed by a very fringe
216740	218540	minority of the online left.
218540	223260	The majority of leftists just seem to be ignorant that this event even happened.
223880	224880	Now let's take a look at the left-wing story.
224880	229000	A video clip went viral of a Seattle police officer responding to an emergency call.
229000	233800	He was speeding to the scene, doing 74 miles in a 25-mile-per-hour area, which cops are
233800	238160	allowed to do, but he didn't have his lights or his siren on, failing to alert himself
238160	239640	to everyone else on the road.
239640	242480	Just like last time, this is footage of a death, so I'm not going to show the whole
242480	243480	clip.
243480	247160	He rams into a woman walking down the street, in pretty much the same way as the previous
247160	248160	story.
248160	249560	She hit the passenger side windshield and died.
249860	254140	Afterward, he pulls over and reports the incident to dispatch, with a particularly disinterested
254140	272620	and annoyed tone in his voice, like this is some inconvenience for him.
272620	276340	Later on in the clip, he's caught laughing to somebody on the phone about the incident,
276340	280040	allegedly someone from the police union, remarking that she was just a regular person
280040	284920	who had limited value, and that the city should just cut her family an $11,000 check to make
284920	285920	it up to them.
306340	320040	This event happened back on January 23rd, but was mostly ignored by social media until
320040	324080	the body cam footage of the officer laughing at the woman's death was released on September
324080	325080	12th.
325080	329680	The woman he killed was Janavi Kandula, an Indian immigrant to the US, and a graduate
329680	331680	student at Northeastern University.
331680	334920	She was just finishing up her master's degree in information systems.
334920	338660	The officer is Kevin Dave, who still works for the Seattle Police Department.
338660	342680	Though after the body cam footage went public, the Seattle Police announced they were auditing
342680	347220	his actions, and the county prosecuting attorney announced a criminal review of the incident.
347220	352220	Despite Dave's initial lack of remorse, he publicly remarked in July that he fucked
352220	354360	up, which is, you know, putting it mildly.
354360	357540	This is also a horrible story, but again, it's a simple case.
357540	361160	The officer was blasting down the road at three times the speed limit without his lights
361160	364340	or sirens on, and he hit someone, and then he has the audacity to act like it wasn't
364340	365660	a big deal afterwards.
365660	370020	Could that have been not a true expression of heartlessness, but rather a trauma response
370020	371020	for him?
371020	372020	Maybe.
372020	375020	But the best case scenario for Dave is that he was really shook up and said some dumb
375020	378000	shit without thinking it through, and none of that makes him innocent.
378000	379000	He still did it.
379000	382060	Hey, this is Future Dev, recording this during editing.
382060	386360	Even though every online source that I could find about this story says that the officer
386360	391100	who hit the pedestrian and the officer who was caught making callous remarks on his body
391100	394440	cam were the same officer, they might not be.
394440	398820	While editing this video, I noticed that the two body cam feeds have a different serial
398820	399820	number.
399820	402420	That might mean that this is two different officers with two different cameras.
402420	405860	However, most mainstream articles haven't pointed out that these are two different officers.
405860	407160	Alright, I just went and checked.
407160	411320	In between my writing this script a few days ago and editing it today, the contents of
411320	413340	a lot of these articles started getting changed.
413340	414780	These outlets are correcting the record.
414780	417620	This shouldn't really change the content of this video though, because this isn't about
417620	419260	the stories themselves.
419260	422180	It's about media bubbles and people's reaction to the stories.
422180	423640	Anyway, let's get back to it.
423640	427140	This story only went viral within left-wing social media circles.
427140	431140	I also follow a healthy amount of righties online, and almost none of them were talking
431140	432140	about it either.
432140	436520	The few that did were these fringe white nationalist types, making jokes about India and talking
436520	441020	about removing all the immigrants, and there was even less of these guys than the revolutionary
441020	444060	ACAB people cheering the death of Andreas Probst in the other story.
444060	448220	The vast majority of right-wingers just seemed to not know what was happening at all.
448220	452220	So we know that both of these stories didn't really have any reach across the political
452220	453220	aisle.
453220	455380	But how did each camp respond to their own story?
455380	459020	Well, the right-wing response to their story was frankly pretty much all talk.
459020	463140	Lots of people going on about how much society is decaying, civilization is collapsing, the
463140	464260	government is inept.
464260	467880	Some people were making it explicitly about race, since one of the two drivers was black
467880	468880	and the other Latino.
468880	470740	No, I don't care what the police report says, fuck you.
470740	471860	While the victim was white.
471860	474700	There was also a fair bit of falsehood mixed in with the truth.
474700	479560	For example, Elon Musk posted this article from the Las Vegas Review with the headline
479560	485060	''Retired police chief killed in bike crash, remembered for laugh and love of coffee.''
485060	488860	With his added reaction, ''An innocent man was murdered in cold blood while riding his
488860	489860	bicycle.
489860	491540	The killers joked about it on social media.
491540	493080	Yet where is the media outrage?
493080	494740	Now you begin to understand the lie.''
494740	498260	The implication here is that the headline was purposely crafted to obscure the fact
498260	500860	that Probst was killed by calling it a bike crash.
500860	501860	I understand this reaction.
501860	506340	We all remember when the Washington Post called the leader of ISIS an ''austere religious
506340	507340	scholar''.
507340	508340	But this time, it's actually wrong.
508340	512940	The article in question was published on August 18th, only a few days after the event, long
512940	514700	before anyone knew what actually happened.
514700	519380	A subsequent article published on August 31st, after the media had viewed the video footage,
519380	520940	explicitly outlines the hit and run.
520940	521940	Thanks, Community Notes.
521940	525420	You continue to help everybody out, even if it means shitting on Elon in the process.
525420	529180	Everyone's favorite culture warrior, Ian Miles-Chiang, showed up with this video clip
529180	531500	from a press conference discussing the event.
531500	536940	We believe that Andy's murder is a direct result of society's decayed family values
536940	541400	and the strong effects that social media has on our youth.
541400	546420	We as a family in no way feel that Andy's murder was based on race or profession.
546420	550240	It was a random act of violence.
550240	556380	We ask you to not politicize or use Andy's murder to fuel political agendas or to create
556380	557380	cultural wars.
558260	561900	I don't know about you, but I don't think his description of this clip as ''prope's
561900	565820	daughter'' doesn't blame the assailants, holds social media responsible, and her devotion
565820	568860	to diversity is unshaken is an accurate description.
568860	570540	In fact, that sounds like spin.
570540	574540	It's pretty reasonable to assume that this wasn't a targeted attack against white people.
574540	579660	It was two joyriding retards who were sociopathic enough to think that hitting somebody constitutes
579660	580660	fun.
580660	583700	If it were a non-white cyclist, I have no doubt they would have also run him down for
583700	584700	their laughs.
584700	588660	The opposite of this claim, that it's somehow this racially-motivated anti-white attack,
588660	593620	is Tariq Nasheed's take, who came out and said that the two were actually white Hispanics,
593620	595500	making this a case of white-on-white crime.
595500	597900	These people are all just retarded.
597900	601900	Most of the right-wing reactions appealed to the same sentiment that Elon did when he
601900	604160	asked ''where is the media outrage?''
604160	606420	There were lots of people saying where's the outrage, in fact.
606420	611660	An editorial on the New York Post titled ''Andreas Prope's Murder Shows Lefty Media's Willful
611660	616620	Blindspots'' states that ''The crime is so violent, so nihilistic, one would expect a
616620	621120	national spotlight on it, yet that simply hasn't happened in the month since the killing.''
621120	624500	The New York Times, the Washington Post, and CNN are all in the wind.
624500	626020	This appears to be mostly true.
626020	629780	As of the making of this video, neither the New York Times or CNN have reported on this
629780	631180	event as far as I can tell.
631180	635540	The Washington Post did publish an article one day after the New York Post lambasted
635540	639940	them for ignoring the story, but framed it in the context of the hate mob that Elon Musk
639940	644780	apparently sent towards the Las Vegas Review for the seemingly inaccurate headline.
644780	646100	Same thing with the Seattle Times.
646100	649940	In fact, most of the news outlets reporting on this event are right-wing ones, like the
649940	651500	New York Post or the Daily Mail.
651500	655640	Though Huffington Post, to their credit, is one left-wing outlet that wasn't afraid to
655640	656640	tackle the issue.
656640	658700	However, when people ask ''where's the outrage?''
658700	661380	They're not just talking about ''where's the media coverage?''
661380	663860	They're also asking ''where's the public statements by politicians?''
663860	666940	''Where's the protests and the riots and the marches and the chanting in front of the
666940	667940	government buildings?''
667940	670580	''Where's the acceptance of the victim as the next cultural martyr?''
670580	673780	''Where's the national days of mourning or the statues or whatever else?''
673780	678660	What they're basically asking is, why isn't Andreas Probst being treated like George Floyd?
678660	682740	They're both victims and Probst is certainly a better man of character than Floyd was.
682740	687860	And the conclusion that people on the right-wing come to is, it's because Probst is white and
687860	690380	white victims make bad martyrs.
690380	693500	Sometimes their conclusion is that the perpetrators are non-white, but most of the time it's that
693500	697100	the victim is white and the cathedral does not commemorate white victims.
697100	698820	That is the right-wing view of the situation.
698820	702660	At the same time though, all of those right-wing people who were outraged, they only seemed
702660	704220	to be outraged online.
704220	707300	As far as I can tell, they didn't get together to march on City Hall or anything like that.
707300	710100	But the people outraged at the left-wing story, they absolutely did.
710100	714600	Now it is true that there absolutely was more of a mainstream media reaction to the killing
714600	719020	of Jovani Kadula, CNN, Washington Post, NBC, New York Times.
719020	722300	But there was also a larger grassroots response as well.
722300	726220	Online petitions, protests, marches in a bunch of major American cities.
726220	730260	Did the mainstream media response only happen because of the grassroots activism putting
730260	731260	them into the story?
731260	732420	That's possible.
732420	736240	Leftists do tend to do more on-the-ground marches and activism than rightists.
736240	740420	The leftist tendency to protest and riot in real life might have been the driving factor
740420	741420	here.
741420	745340	Or did the mainstream media response cause that grassroots activism by pushing the story
745340	746340	into the news cycle?
746340	747500	That's also very possible.
747500	751420	It might be the case that there was no real-life outrage over the Probst killing because of
751420	756140	a media failure in comparison to the media shining their spotlight on the Kadula killing.
756140	757140	It's hard to tell.
757140	760820	The earliest tweets about the Kadula story from this news cycle are from around the same
760820	763200	time as the earliest articles were published.
763200	766580	So we don't really know whether the chicken or the egg came first.
766580	768300	Could it be because of the stories themselves?
768300	772720	The first is about two non-white youths driving around in a stolen car and killing a random
772720	775600	white guy for kicks, who just happened to be a retired cop.
775600	778220	It doesn't seem like they killed him because he was white and they didn't know he was
778220	779220	a cop.
779220	783580	But those two things are absolutely factors in choosing not to report on the story if
783580	786720	the outlet in question is biased towards the left.
786720	791540	The second story is about a cop killing a brown female student immigrant and going viral
791540	794100	for showing no remorse about his actions.
794100	798420	Now the demographics have switched places, and the left, being very anti-cop and very
798420	802020	pro-immigrant, is much more inclined to report on the story.
802020	805700	Otherwise, these stories are pretty identical, killing an innocent with a car and showing
805700	807940	an extreme lack of remorse for doing so.
807940	812620	The issue, ultimately, is that the right-leaning media reported on both stories while the left-leaning
812660	815900	media only reported on the story that favored their politics.
815900	820800	That's actually a very serious problem, and why you need to consume news from across
820800	821800	the political spectrum.
821800	825760	No, you can't only consume right-wing media just because they report on both stories.
825760	828240	They still put spins on stories that don't suit their interests.
828240	829980	Fox News is legendary for that.
829980	833900	You cannot remain in those echo chambers that I started the video off talking about and
833900	835860	somehow still call yourself informed.
835860	839660	Yeah, right-wing media might have reported on both of these stories while left-wing media
839660	840660	didn't.
840660	841660	And that's bad.
841700	846400	At least, the average leftoid has an excuse to only get outraged over one story.
846400	849740	They exist in a news bubble that doesn't allow them to learn about the other one.
849740	853980	Your average rightoid, reading their own media sources, had the opportunity to learn about
853980	859420	both tragedies, and nonetheless, they still only focus their online outrage towards the
859420	861220	one that suited their political views better.
861220	866140	When I look at this picture, I see not only two news bubbles that have limited overlap,
866140	868380	but two fundamentally different views of reality.
868660	872260	It's important to understand that when somebody has a true belief about the world, that's
872260	873700	not some theory for them.
873700	876860	That's how reality actually looks from their point of view.
876860	878100	Let me give you an example.
878100	879660	Let's say that I'm accused of murder.
879660	882900	The police find some physical evidence of me at the crime scene.
882900	884820	There's some fingerprints, there's my hair or something.
884820	888980	Now let's say in reality, the objective truth is that I didn't actually murder the
888980	889980	guy.
889980	892500	I just happened to walk through the area two minutes before.
892500	896420	Most other people, not knowing my experiences because they didn't live them, will believe
896420	897580	that I'm the murderer.
897580	901700	And from their point of view, the story of reality will read that I killed somebody and
901700	902700	got away with it.
902700	907300	From my point of view, people treating me coldly due to their belief will appear insane
907300	911460	to me because my reading of the story of reality says that I'm innocent.
911460	916340	We both have different beliefs about what reality is, but those beliefs don't feel
916340	918660	like beliefs from the point of view of the believer.
918660	920340	They feel like reality itself.
920340	924700	So, to the rightoid who is in their media bubble, the story of reality reads like nobody
924700	929620	gives a shit about two non-white kids callously running down a retired white cop.
929620	933780	Because nobody's out there protesting, nobody's rioting, nobody's starting social movements,
933780	935860	nobody's reporting on it in the mainstream media.
935860	940560	While to the leftoids who are in their media bubble, the story of reality reads like nobody
940560	944860	gives a shit about a young immigrant woman who is callously run down by a cop because
944860	949620	it's taken six months and a possible body cam leak to the media to even get an investigation
949620	950660	off the ground.
950660	952260	Which belief is the actual reality?
952260	953600	It's probably a bit of both.
953600	955300	As unsatisfying an answer as that is.
955300	960020	But it is undeniable that in this case, the left-leaning media dropped the ball on covering
960020	964900	the right story, while at the same time, right-leaning people had more of an opportunity to care
964900	967400	about the left story and still failed to do so.
967400	971400	This kind of reminds me of the train derailment situation in Palestine, Ohio at the start
971400	972400	of the year.
972400	974940	People were screaming about how it wasn't going viral and no one's talking about it.
974940	979080	When before it went viral on Twitter, CNN and other news outlets actually were publishing
979080	980080	articles about the event.
980080	984120	It's just that nobody cared until that one dude stood underneath that unnaturally
984120	987500	darkened sky and yelled that there was an emergency happening and nobody was paying
987500	988500	attention to them.
988500	991360	Maybe it really is one of those type of things, where if you want an event to get attention,
991360	994040	you gotta make way more noise, both online and offline.
994040	995040	Or maybe it's a media failure.
995040	996520	Again, probably a bit of both.
996520	1000640	Oh well, I can't change any institutions, and I certainly can't change large swaths
1000640	1001640	of individuals.
1001640	1003360	I'm just a random, overweight nerd.
1003360	1005040	It's just you and me here right now.
1005040	1006720	So I'll leave you with a bit of advice.
1006720	1011080	Push yourself to step outside of your wheelhouse and consume ideas that you wouldn't naturally
1011080	1012240	gravitate towards.
1012240	1015200	The algorithm wants to push you content pre-made for you.
1015200	1017960	Resist that and seek something you wouldn't normally enjoy.
1017960	1021880	If you refuse to read a specific news outlet due to its partisan nature, start reading
1021880	1022880	it.
1022880	1024240	You're smart enough to cut through their bullshit on your own.
1024240	1025480	You don't need to avoid them.
1025480	1027240	And yes, this applies to both sides.
1027240	1031560	We all know about the crying leftoid snowflakes who block everyone on social media and they
1031560	1034960	desperately want to make the entire world their safe space where they don't have to
1034960	1038960	suffer any pushback for their dogshit socialist arguments, who think that you're literally
1038960	1042080	killing trannies by using the wrong pronouns and all that retarded shit.
1042080	1044000	But do you think the right doesn't do that too?
1044000	1046360	I'm a co-host on the ArchCast with my friend ArchWarhammer.
1046360	1050720	He's way more right-wing than me by far, while his audience is way further right than
1050720	1051720	either of us.
1051720	1055840	His chat is full of libertarians and ancaps, and I'm considered a communist over there.
1055840	1059720	And whenever I show up, there's that small vocal contingent of people who begin to scream
1059720	1062760	that they can't handle me being here, they can't watch the show anymore, they gotta
1062760	1064940	unsub, they can't take hearing opinions they disagree with.
1064940	1066860	These guys are just snowflakes.
1066860	1070540	They're right-wing snowflakes in a right-wing safe space, just like the leftoids.
1070540	1074100	And in both cases, these people are intellectually stunted.
1074100	1077700	They have no response to being challenged other than to soy out.
1077700	1079940	You've all got a little bit of snowflake inside of us, guys.
1079940	1082580	It is uncomfortable to be pushed back on, I get it.
1082580	1086620	But part of growing up is killing the snowflake and accepting that people you really disagree
1086620	1089700	with do actually have some good points worth hearing.
1089700	1091500	Anyway, that's all for me today, guys.
1091500	1095700	Naomi and I watched that god-fucking-awful Stray's movie, so check that vlog out.
1095700	1097580	I'll also be streaming tonight, so come say hello.
1097580	1099700	Okay, I'll see you guys next time.
1099700	1100140	I love you.
