00:00.000 --> 00:08.160
We've all seen images like this before.

00:08.160 --> 00:13.220
These are media ecosystem maps, showing that the broader left-wing and right-wing exist

00:13.220 --> 00:14.900
in their own media bubbles.

00:14.900 --> 00:18.620
What this means is, if you're a left-wing person, you're much more likely to encounter

00:18.620 --> 00:24.060
media and opinions online that reinforce your worldview, and you rarely have that view challenged.

00:24.060 --> 00:26.420
Same with right-wing people in their own bubble.

00:26.420 --> 00:31.200
As a result, a story might go viral in one sphere, and barely even be noticed in another.

00:31.200 --> 00:35.300
This past week, two very similar stories went viral around the same time.

00:35.300 --> 00:39.620
One of them commented heavily on by right-leaning people, and virtually ignored by the left,

00:39.620 --> 00:43.600
and the other, the inverse, commented heavily on by left-leaning people, and virtually ignored

00:43.600 --> 00:44.600
by the right.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.160
So, let's take a look at them both.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.720
Firstly, the right-wing story.

00:47.720 --> 00:53.040
A video clip went viral of two teenagers in a stolen car, ramming into a cyclist in Las

00:53.040 --> 00:54.040
Vegas.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.540
I'm not going to play the whole clip because I don't want my channel to get nuked, but

00:56.540 --> 01:00.180
basically, these kids are laughing, speeding by other drivers.

01:00.180 --> 01:03.660
One yells at the other hit him, they ram into his back, he shatters the windshield, and

01:03.660 --> 01:07.300
then falls onto the road.

01:07.300 --> 01:11.020
The two kids laugh about how hard he got hit, and then exclaim that they gotta get out of

01:11.020 --> 01:15.540
there before they get caught.

01:15.540 --> 01:19.320
The video was taken from the passenger seat, so it was quite nice of these idiots to record

01:19.320 --> 01:20.720
proof of them committing a murder.

01:20.720 --> 01:25.060
The event happened back on August 14th, but the story only hit the current news cycle

01:25.060 --> 01:29.780
after the video clip went viral on September 15th, presumably shortly after the two were

01:29.780 --> 01:30.780
arrested.

01:30.780 --> 01:34.460
Jesus Ayala had just turned 18, Jasmir Keyes was 16.

01:34.460 --> 01:38.220
Ayala seemed to be under the impression that he was still a juvenile, saying to the police,

01:38.220 --> 01:40.060
you think this juvenile is going to do some time?

01:40.060 --> 01:42.140
I'll be out in 30 days, I bet you.

01:42.140 --> 01:44.060
And it's just a hit and run, slap on the wrist.

01:44.060 --> 01:48.980
Ayala had not been informed of any hit and run charges against him when he made these

01:48.980 --> 01:49.980
statements.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.080
The police were only there to arrest him under a prior warrant.

01:53.080 --> 01:58.120
These statements and the video footage allowed the cops to slap him with 18 charges, including

01:58.120 --> 02:00.440
murder, attempted murder, and grand larceny.

02:00.440 --> 02:04.760
Ayala's mother apologized for her son's actions, saying through a translator, I don't

02:04.760 --> 02:06.160
know if God can forgive him.

02:06.160 --> 02:10.000
And yeah, despite Ayala clearly being Latino, his booking paperwork shows that the police

02:10.000 --> 02:11.280
filed him as white.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.120
Jasmir Keyes was arrested on a different day and had a different appearance in court from

02:15.120 --> 02:18.160
his friend, and I wasn't able to dig up what charges he even slapped with.

02:18.180 --> 02:21.540
But despite being 16, he's also being charged as an adult.

02:21.540 --> 02:26.100
Keyes' mother was not apologetic like Ayala's was, saying that her son's true story will

02:26.100 --> 02:29.100
come out, not these media false representations.

02:29.100 --> 02:34.060
The investigation eventually uncovered that on that same day, these guys stole three vehicles

02:34.060 --> 02:37.940
in total, hit the one guy, tried to hit another, and also committed a burglary.

02:37.940 --> 02:41.420
The man that was killed was a retired police chief, Andreas Probst.

02:41.420 --> 02:42.740
How do you pronounce that name?

02:42.740 --> 02:43.740
Probst?

02:43.740 --> 02:45.940
It's a horrible story, but it's also a really simple case.

02:45.960 --> 02:49.720
Two idiot kids went for a joyride and racked up a huge list of charges.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.960
Multiple car thefts, murder, attempted murder, it's like it's Grand Theft Auto over here.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.920
They've got physical evidence, video evidence.

02:54.920 --> 02:58.320
Ayala was stupid enough to open his dumb fuck mouth when he was being arrested.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.140
This is an open and shut case.

03:00.140 --> 03:03.320
As always, wait for the trial, who knows, maybe some weird evidence might come out or

03:03.320 --> 03:07.120
something, but as it currently stands, I feel pretty confident that justice will be done

03:07.120 --> 03:08.120
here.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.120
The evidence is just that overwhelming.

03:09.120 --> 03:13.640
The point is, though, this story only went viral within right-wing social media circles.

03:13.660 --> 03:17.580
I follow a healthy amount of lefties online, and almost none of them are talking about

03:17.580 --> 03:18.580
it.

03:18.580 --> 03:22.780
The few that were were these fringe revolutionary ACAB types saying that Probst deserved it

03:22.780 --> 03:26.420
because he was a cop, and that he's also corrupt because he took a disability pension

03:26.420 --> 03:31.340
that was under legal scrutiny back in 2011, making these kids heroes for purging a corrupt

03:31.340 --> 03:32.340
pig or something like that.

03:32.340 --> 03:36.740
Though I want to make it very clear, that opinion was only expressed by a very fringe

03:36.740 --> 03:38.540
minority of the online left.

03:38.540 --> 03:43.260
The majority of leftists just seem to be ignorant that this event even happened.

03:43.880 --> 03:44.880
Now let's take a look at the left-wing story.

03:44.880 --> 03:49.000
A video clip went viral of a Seattle police officer responding to an emergency call.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.800
He was speeding to the scene, doing 74 miles in a 25-mile-per-hour area, which cops are

03:53.800 --> 03:58.160
allowed to do, but he didn't have his lights or his siren on, failing to alert himself

03:58.160 --> 03:59.640
to everyone else on the road.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.480
Just like last time, this is footage of a death, so I'm not going to show the whole

04:02.480 --> 04:03.480
clip.

04:03.480 --> 04:07.160
He rams into a woman walking down the street, in pretty much the same way as the previous

04:07.160 --> 04:08.160
story.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.560
She hit the passenger side windshield and died.

04:09.860 --> 04:14.140
Afterward, he pulls over and reports the incident to dispatch, with a particularly disinterested

04:14.140 --> 04:32.620
and annoyed tone in his voice, like this is some inconvenience for him.

04:32.620 --> 04:36.340
Later on in the clip, he's caught laughing to somebody on the phone about the incident,

04:36.340 --> 04:40.040
allegedly someone from the police union, remarking that she was just a regular person

04:40.040 --> 04:44.920
who had limited value, and that the city should just cut her family an $11,000 check to make

04:44.920 --> 04:45.920
it up to them.

05:06.340 --> 05:20.040
This event happened back on January 23rd, but was mostly ignored by social media until

05:20.040 --> 05:24.080
the body cam footage of the officer laughing at the woman's death was released on September

05:24.080 --> 05:25.080
12th.

05:25.080 --> 05:29.680
The woman he killed was Janavi Kandula, an Indian immigrant to the US, and a graduate

05:29.680 --> 05:31.680
student at Northeastern University.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.920
She was just finishing up her master's degree in information systems.

05:34.920 --> 05:38.660
The officer is Kevin Dave, who still works for the Seattle Police Department.

05:38.660 --> 05:42.680
Though after the body cam footage went public, the Seattle Police announced they were auditing

05:42.680 --> 05:47.220
his actions, and the county prosecuting attorney announced a criminal review of the incident.

05:47.220 --> 05:52.220
Despite Dave's initial lack of remorse, he publicly remarked in July that he fucked

05:52.220 --> 05:54.360
up, which is, you know, putting it mildly.

05:54.360 --> 05:57.540
This is also a horrible story, but again, it's a simple case.

05:57.540 --> 06:01.160
The officer was blasting down the road at three times the speed limit without his lights

06:01.160 --> 06:04.340
or sirens on, and he hit someone, and then he has the audacity to act like it wasn't

06:04.340 --> 06:05.660
a big deal afterwards.

06:05.660 --> 06:10.020
Could that have been not a true expression of heartlessness, but rather a trauma response

06:10.020 --> 06:11.020
for him?

06:11.020 --> 06:12.020
Maybe.

06:12.020 --> 06:15.020
But the best case scenario for Dave is that he was really shook up and said some dumb

06:15.020 --> 06:18.000
shit without thinking it through, and none of that makes him innocent.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
He still did it.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.060
Hey, this is Future Dev, recording this during editing.

06:22.060 --> 06:26.360
Even though every online source that I could find about this story says that the officer

06:26.360 --> 06:31.100
who hit the pedestrian and the officer who was caught making callous remarks on his body

06:31.100 --> 06:34.440
cam were the same officer, they might not be.

06:34.440 --> 06:38.820
While editing this video, I noticed that the two body cam feeds have a different serial

06:38.820 --> 06:39.820
number.

06:39.820 --> 06:42.420
That might mean that this is two different officers with two different cameras.

06:42.420 --> 06:45.860
However, most mainstream articles haven't pointed out that these are two different officers.

06:45.860 --> 06:47.160
Alright, I just went and checked.

06:47.160 --> 06:51.320
In between my writing this script a few days ago and editing it today, the contents of

06:51.320 --> 06:53.340
a lot of these articles started getting changed.

06:53.340 --> 06:54.780
These outlets are correcting the record.

06:54.780 --> 06:57.620
This shouldn't really change the content of this video though, because this isn't about

06:57.620 --> 06:59.260
the stories themselves.

06:59.260 --> 07:02.180
It's about media bubbles and people's reaction to the stories.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.640
Anyway, let's get back to it.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.140
This story only went viral within left-wing social media circles.

07:07.140 --> 07:11.140
I also follow a healthy amount of righties online, and almost none of them were talking

07:11.140 --> 07:12.140
about it either.

07:12.140 --> 07:16.520
The few that did were these fringe white nationalist types, making jokes about India and talking

07:16.520 --> 07:21.020
about removing all the immigrants, and there was even less of these guys than the revolutionary

07:21.020 --> 07:24.060
ACAB people cheering the death of Andreas Probst in the other story.

07:24.060 --> 07:28.220
The vast majority of right-wingers just seemed to not know what was happening at all.

07:28.220 --> 07:32.220
So we know that both of these stories didn't really have any reach across the political

07:32.220 --> 07:33.220
aisle.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.380
But how did each camp respond to their own story?

07:35.380 --> 07:39.020
Well, the right-wing response to their story was frankly pretty much all talk.

07:39.020 --> 07:43.140
Lots of people going on about how much society is decaying, civilization is collapsing, the

07:43.140 --> 07:44.260
government is inept.

07:44.260 --> 07:47.880
Some people were making it explicitly about race, since one of the two drivers was black

07:47.880 --> 07:48.880
and the other Latino.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.740
No, I don't care what the police report says, fuck you.

07:50.740 --> 07:51.860
While the victim was white.

07:51.860 --> 07:54.700
There was also a fair bit of falsehood mixed in with the truth.

07:54.700 --> 07:59.560
For example, Elon Musk posted this article from the Las Vegas Review with the headline

07:59.560 --> 08:05.060
''Retired police chief killed in bike crash, remembered for laugh and love of coffee.''

08:05.060 --> 08:08.860
With his added reaction, ''An innocent man was murdered in cold blood while riding his

08:08.860 --> 08:09.860
bicycle.

08:09.860 --> 08:11.540
The killers joked about it on social media.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.080
Yet where is the media outrage?

08:13.080 --> 08:14.740
Now you begin to understand the lie.''

08:14.740 --> 08:18.260
The implication here is that the headline was purposely crafted to obscure the fact

08:18.260 --> 08:20.860
that Probst was killed by calling it a bike crash.

08:20.860 --> 08:21.860
I understand this reaction.

08:21.860 --> 08:26.340
We all remember when the Washington Post called the leader of ISIS an ''austere religious

08:26.340 --> 08:27.340
scholar''.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.340
But this time, it's actually wrong.

08:28.340 --> 08:32.940
The article in question was published on August 18th, only a few days after the event, long

08:32.940 --> 08:34.700
before anyone knew what actually happened.

08:34.700 --> 08:39.380
A subsequent article published on August 31st, after the media had viewed the video footage,

08:39.380 --> 08:40.940
explicitly outlines the hit and run.

08:40.940 --> 08:41.940
Thanks, Community Notes.

08:41.940 --> 08:45.420
You continue to help everybody out, even if it means shitting on Elon in the process.

08:45.420 --> 08:49.180
Everyone's favorite culture warrior, Ian Miles-Chiang, showed up with this video clip

08:49.180 --> 08:51.500
from a press conference discussing the event.

08:51.500 --> 08:56.940
We believe that Andy's murder is a direct result of society's decayed family values

08:56.940 --> 09:01.400
and the strong effects that social media has on our youth.

09:01.400 --> 09:06.420
We as a family in no way feel that Andy's murder was based on race or profession.

09:06.420 --> 09:10.240
It was a random act of violence.

09:10.240 --> 09:16.380
We ask you to not politicize or use Andy's murder to fuel political agendas or to create

09:16.380 --> 09:17.380
cultural wars.

09:18.260 --> 09:21.900
I don't know about you, but I don't think his description of this clip as ''prope's

09:21.900 --> 09:25.820
daughter'' doesn't blame the assailants, holds social media responsible, and her devotion

09:25.820 --> 09:28.860
to diversity is unshaken is an accurate description.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.540
In fact, that sounds like spin.

09:30.540 --> 09:34.540
It's pretty reasonable to assume that this wasn't a targeted attack against white people.

09:34.540 --> 09:39.660
It was two joyriding retards who were sociopathic enough to think that hitting somebody constitutes

09:39.660 --> 09:40.660
fun.

09:40.660 --> 09:43.700
If it were a non-white cyclist, I have no doubt they would have also run him down for

09:43.700 --> 09:44.700
their laughs.

09:44.700 --> 09:48.660
The opposite of this claim, that it's somehow this racially-motivated anti-white attack,

09:48.660 --> 09:53.620
is Tariq Nasheed's take, who came out and said that the two were actually white Hispanics,

09:53.620 --> 09:55.500
making this a case of white-on-white crime.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.900
These people are all just retarded.

09:57.900 --> 10:01.900
Most of the right-wing reactions appealed to the same sentiment that Elon did when he

10:01.900 --> 10:04.160
asked ''where is the media outrage?''

10:04.160 --> 10:06.420
There were lots of people saying where's the outrage, in fact.

10:06.420 --> 10:11.660
An editorial on the New York Post titled ''Andreas Prope's Murder Shows Lefty Media's Willful

10:11.660 --> 10:16.620
Blindspots'' states that ''The crime is so violent, so nihilistic, one would expect a

10:16.620 --> 10:21.120
national spotlight on it, yet that simply hasn't happened in the month since the killing.''

10:21.120 --> 10:24.500
The New York Times, the Washington Post, and CNN are all in the wind.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.020
This appears to be mostly true.

10:26.020 --> 10:29.780
As of the making of this video, neither the New York Times or CNN have reported on this

10:29.780 --> 10:31.180
event as far as I can tell.

10:31.180 --> 10:35.540
The Washington Post did publish an article one day after the New York Post lambasted

10:35.540 --> 10:39.940
them for ignoring the story, but framed it in the context of the hate mob that Elon Musk

10:39.940 --> 10:44.780
apparently sent towards the Las Vegas Review for the seemingly inaccurate headline.

10:44.780 --> 10:46.100
Same thing with the Seattle Times.

10:46.100 --> 10:49.940
In fact, most of the news outlets reporting on this event are right-wing ones, like the

10:49.940 --> 10:51.500
New York Post or the Daily Mail.

10:51.500 --> 10:55.640
Though Huffington Post, to their credit, is one left-wing outlet that wasn't afraid to

10:55.640 --> 10:56.640
tackle the issue.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.700
However, when people ask ''where's the outrage?''

10:58.700 --> 11:01.380
They're not just talking about ''where's the media coverage?''

11:01.380 --> 11:03.860
They're also asking ''where's the public statements by politicians?''

11:03.860 --> 11:06.940
''Where's the protests and the riots and the marches and the chanting in front of the

11:06.940 --> 11:07.940
government buildings?''

11:07.940 --> 11:10.580
''Where's the acceptance of the victim as the next cultural martyr?''

11:10.580 --> 11:13.780
''Where's the national days of mourning or the statues or whatever else?''

11:13.780 --> 11:18.660
What they're basically asking is, why isn't Andreas Probst being treated like George Floyd?

11:18.660 --> 11:22.740
They're both victims and Probst is certainly a better man of character than Floyd was.

11:22.740 --> 11:27.860
And the conclusion that people on the right-wing come to is, it's because Probst is white and

11:27.860 --> 11:30.380
white victims make bad martyrs.

11:30.380 --> 11:33.500
Sometimes their conclusion is that the perpetrators are non-white, but most of the time it's that

11:33.500 --> 11:37.100
the victim is white and the cathedral does not commemorate white victims.

11:37.100 --> 11:38.820
That is the right-wing view of the situation.

11:38.820 --> 11:42.660
At the same time though, all of those right-wing people who were outraged, they only seemed

11:42.660 --> 11:44.220
to be outraged online.

11:44.220 --> 11:47.300
As far as I can tell, they didn't get together to march on City Hall or anything like that.

11:47.300 --> 11:50.100
But the people outraged at the left-wing story, they absolutely did.

11:50.100 --> 11:54.600
Now it is true that there absolutely was more of a mainstream media reaction to the killing

11:54.600 --> 11:59.020
of Jovani Kadula, CNN, Washington Post, NBC, New York Times.

11:59.020 --> 12:02.300
But there was also a larger grassroots response as well.

12:02.300 --> 12:06.220
Online petitions, protests, marches in a bunch of major American cities.

12:06.220 --> 12:10.260
Did the mainstream media response only happen because of the grassroots activism putting

12:10.260 --> 12:11.260
them into the story?

12:11.260 --> 12:12.420
That's possible.

12:12.420 --> 12:16.240
Leftists do tend to do more on-the-ground marches and activism than rightists.

12:16.240 --> 12:20.420
The leftist tendency to protest and riot in real life might have been the driving factor

12:20.420 --> 12:21.420
here.

12:21.420 --> 12:25.340
Or did the mainstream media response cause that grassroots activism by pushing the story

12:25.340 --> 12:26.340
into the news cycle?

12:26.340 --> 12:27.500
That's also very possible.

12:27.500 --> 12:31.420
It might be the case that there was no real-life outrage over the Probst killing because of

12:31.420 --> 12:36.140
a media failure in comparison to the media shining their spotlight on the Kadula killing.

12:36.140 --> 12:37.140
It's hard to tell.

12:37.140 --> 12:40.820
The earliest tweets about the Kadula story from this news cycle are from around the same

12:40.820 --> 12:43.200
time as the earliest articles were published.

12:43.200 --> 12:46.580
So we don't really know whether the chicken or the egg came first.

12:46.580 --> 12:48.300
Could it be because of the stories themselves?

12:48.300 --> 12:52.720
The first is about two non-white youths driving around in a stolen car and killing a random

12:52.720 --> 12:55.600
white guy for kicks, who just happened to be a retired cop.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.220
It doesn't seem like they killed him because he was white and they didn't know he was

12:58.220 --> 12:59.220
a cop.

12:59.220 --> 13:03.580
But those two things are absolutely factors in choosing not to report on the story if

13:03.580 --> 13:06.720
the outlet in question is biased towards the left.

13:06.720 --> 13:11.540
The second story is about a cop killing a brown female student immigrant and going viral

13:11.540 --> 13:14.100
for showing no remorse about his actions.

13:14.100 --> 13:18.420
Now the demographics have switched places, and the left, being very anti-cop and very

13:18.420 --> 13:22.020
pro-immigrant, is much more inclined to report on the story.

13:22.020 --> 13:25.700
Otherwise, these stories are pretty identical, killing an innocent with a car and showing

13:25.700 --> 13:27.940
an extreme lack of remorse for doing so.

13:27.940 --> 13:32.620
The issue, ultimately, is that the right-leaning media reported on both stories while the left-leaning

13:32.660 --> 13:35.900
media only reported on the story that favored their politics.

13:35.900 --> 13:40.800
That's actually a very serious problem, and why you need to consume news from across

13:40.800 --> 13:41.800
the political spectrum.

13:41.800 --> 13:45.760
No, you can't only consume right-wing media just because they report on both stories.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.240
They still put spins on stories that don't suit their interests.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.980
Fox News is legendary for that.

13:49.980 --> 13:53.900
You cannot remain in those echo chambers that I started the video off talking about and

13:53.900 --> 13:55.860
somehow still call yourself informed.

13:55.860 --> 13:59.660
Yeah, right-wing media might have reported on both of these stories while left-wing media

13:59.660 --> 14:00.660
didn't.

14:00.660 --> 14:01.660
And that's bad.

14:01.700 --> 14:06.400
At least, the average leftoid has an excuse to only get outraged over one story.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.740
They exist in a news bubble that doesn't allow them to learn about the other one.

14:09.740 --> 14:13.980
Your average rightoid, reading their own media sources, had the opportunity to learn about

14:13.980 --> 14:19.420
both tragedies, and nonetheless, they still only focus their online outrage towards the

14:19.420 --> 14:21.220
one that suited their political views better.

14:21.220 --> 14:26.140
When I look at this picture, I see not only two news bubbles that have limited overlap,

14:26.140 --> 14:28.380
but two fundamentally different views of reality.

14:28.660 --> 14:32.260
It's important to understand that when somebody has a true belief about the world, that's

14:32.260 --> 14:33.700
not some theory for them.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.860
That's how reality actually looks from their point of view.

14:36.860 --> 14:38.100
Let me give you an example.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.660
Let's say that I'm accused of murder.

14:39.660 --> 14:42.900
The police find some physical evidence of me at the crime scene.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.820
There's some fingerprints, there's my hair or something.

14:44.820 --> 14:48.980
Now let's say in reality, the objective truth is that I didn't actually murder the

14:48.980 --> 14:49.980
guy.

14:49.980 --> 14:52.500
I just happened to walk through the area two minutes before.

14:52.500 --> 14:56.420
Most other people, not knowing my experiences because they didn't live them, will believe

14:56.420 --> 14:57.580
that I'm the murderer.

14:57.580 --> 15:01.700
And from their point of view, the story of reality will read that I killed somebody and

15:01.700 --> 15:02.700
got away with it.

15:02.700 --> 15:07.300
From my point of view, people treating me coldly due to their belief will appear insane

15:07.300 --> 15:11.460
to me because my reading of the story of reality says that I'm innocent.

15:11.460 --> 15:16.340
We both have different beliefs about what reality is, but those beliefs don't feel

15:16.340 --> 15:18.660
like beliefs from the point of view of the believer.

15:18.660 --> 15:20.340
They feel like reality itself.

15:20.340 --> 15:24.700
So, to the rightoid who is in their media bubble, the story of reality reads like nobody

15:24.700 --> 15:29.620
gives a shit about two non-white kids callously running down a retired white cop.

15:29.620 --> 15:33.780
Because nobody's out there protesting, nobody's rioting, nobody's starting social movements,

15:33.780 --> 15:35.860
nobody's reporting on it in the mainstream media.

15:35.860 --> 15:40.560
While to the leftoids who are in their media bubble, the story of reality reads like nobody

15:40.560 --> 15:44.860
gives a shit about a young immigrant woman who is callously run down by a cop because

15:44.860 --> 15:49.620
it's taken six months and a possible body cam leak to the media to even get an investigation

15:49.620 --> 15:50.660
off the ground.

15:50.660 --> 15:52.260
Which belief is the actual reality?

15:52.260 --> 15:53.600
It's probably a bit of both.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.300
As unsatisfying an answer as that is.

15:55.300 --> 16:00.020
But it is undeniable that in this case, the left-leaning media dropped the ball on covering

16:00.020 --> 16:04.900
the right story, while at the same time, right-leaning people had more of an opportunity to care

16:04.900 --> 16:07.400
about the left story and still failed to do so.

16:07.400 --> 16:11.400
This kind of reminds me of the train derailment situation in Palestine, Ohio at the start

16:11.400 --> 16:12.400
of the year.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.940
People were screaming about how it wasn't going viral and no one's talking about it.

16:14.940 --> 16:19.080
When before it went viral on Twitter, CNN and other news outlets actually were publishing

16:19.080 --> 16:20.080
articles about the event.

16:20.080 --> 16:24.120
It's just that nobody cared until that one dude stood underneath that unnaturally

16:24.120 --> 16:27.500
darkened sky and yelled that there was an emergency happening and nobody was paying

16:27.500 --> 16:28.500
attention to them.

16:28.500 --> 16:31.360
Maybe it really is one of those type of things, where if you want an event to get attention,

16:31.360 --> 16:34.040
you gotta make way more noise, both online and offline.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.040
Or maybe it's a media failure.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.520
Again, probably a bit of both.

16:36.520 --> 16:40.640
Oh well, I can't change any institutions, and I certainly can't change large swaths

16:40.640 --> 16:41.640
of individuals.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.360
I'm just a random, overweight nerd.

16:43.360 --> 16:45.040
It's just you and me here right now.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.720
So I'll leave you with a bit of advice.

16:46.720 --> 16:51.080
Push yourself to step outside of your wheelhouse and consume ideas that you wouldn't naturally

16:51.080 --> 16:52.240
gravitate towards.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.200
The algorithm wants to push you content pre-made for you.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.960
Resist that and seek something you wouldn't normally enjoy.

16:57.960 --> 17:01.880
If you refuse to read a specific news outlet due to its partisan nature, start reading

17:01.880 --> 17:02.880
it.

17:02.880 --> 17:04.240
You're smart enough to cut through their bullshit on your own.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.480
You don't need to avoid them.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.240
And yes, this applies to both sides.

17:07.240 --> 17:11.560
We all know about the crying leftoid snowflakes who block everyone on social media and they

17:11.560 --> 17:14.960
desperately want to make the entire world their safe space where they don't have to

17:14.960 --> 17:18.960
suffer any pushback for their dogshit socialist arguments, who think that you're literally

17:18.960 --> 17:22.080
killing trannies by using the wrong pronouns and all that retarded shit.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.000
But do you think the right doesn't do that too?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.360
I'm a co-host on the ArchCast with my friend ArchWarhammer.

17:26.360 --> 17:30.720
He's way more right-wing than me by far, while his audience is way further right than

17:30.720 --> 17:31.720
either of us.

17:31.720 --> 17:35.840
His chat is full of libertarians and ancaps, and I'm considered a communist over there.

17:35.840 --> 17:39.720
And whenever I show up, there's that small vocal contingent of people who begin to scream

17:39.720 --> 17:42.760
that they can't handle me being here, they can't watch the show anymore, they gotta

17:42.760 --> 17:44.940
unsub, they can't take hearing opinions they disagree with.

17:44.940 --> 17:46.860
These guys are just snowflakes.

17:46.860 --> 17:50.540
They're right-wing snowflakes in a right-wing safe space, just like the leftoids.

17:50.540 --> 17:54.100
And in both cases, these people are intellectually stunted.

17:54.100 --> 17:57.700
They have no response to being challenged other than to soy out.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.940
You've all got a little bit of snowflake inside of us, guys.

17:59.940 --> 18:02.580
It is uncomfortable to be pushed back on, I get it.

18:02.580 --> 18:06.620
But part of growing up is killing the snowflake and accepting that people you really disagree

18:06.620 --> 18:09.700
with do actually have some good points worth hearing.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.500
Anyway, that's all for me today, guys.

18:11.500 --> 18:15.700
Naomi and I watched that god-fucking-awful Stray's movie, so check that vlog out.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.580
I'll also be streaming tonight, so come say hello.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.700
Okay, I'll see you guys next time.

18:19.700 --> 18:20.140
I love you.
