0	9760	So, the rightoids have found a country song with political lyrics to coalesce around.
9760	16520	No, no, not that one. That was from a previous news cycle. I'm talking about rich men north
16520	21240	of Richmond. The song is a redneck working class American creed, and every leftoid who
21240	25260	listens to it has a very turbulent reaction. The first half of it is something that any
25260	49100	socialist can get behind. Whenever I've watched a crumbtuber react to the song,
49100	53540	they're actually initially into it, but all of their faces sour when they hear the second half.
55260	82780	This is the wrong type of populism for your average socialist. Yeah, some of them are still
82780	86500	trying to claim this song as the soul of the proletariat or whatever, but most of them have
86500	91380	moved on to decry it as a right-wing astroturf job. What's really telling is that they vehemently
91380	95220	object to the Epstein's Island reference, even though there's a fair bit of evidence regarding
95220	99740	Epstein's behaviors on that island. It's always going to be funny to me that socialists believe
99740	104780	the world is secretly controlled by the 1% who use their capital to circumvent laws and destroy
104780	110100	nations, that modern democracy is a sham meant to post hoc justify the ruling class's existence.
110100	115180	All of that populist brain rot shit. But the minute a Nazi walks in and asks about the genetics
115180	119380	of the people involved, suddenly now it's a dangerous conspiracy theory. They're all fucking
119380	123900	retarded. Anyway, the legacy media is all over this guy, talking about how the far-right loves
123900	127980	him and how his anti-government rhetoric is dangerous and everything else. Here's the thing,
127980	131620	the people writing these articles are the same people demanding their student loans be forgiven.
131620	135460	Meanwhile, you think guys like this even have a student loan? This is something I pointed out in
135460	139740	my Bidenomics video. If you print money and give it to the middle class, the resulting inflation is
139740	144180	an informal tax of that value on anybody who didn't receive the printed money. The rich might
144180	148980	not care, but the poor certainly do. If forgiving the middle class's student loans causes inflation,
148980	153220	and it might, then it's the poor people who suffer as the spending power of whatever savings
153220	158100	they might have, plummets. Here's the thing about viral phenomenon. This applies to positive trends,
158100	161660	like a song taking off, but it also applies to negative trends, like a consumer boycott.
161660	166500	Generally, when things go viral online, it's more common that it begins in a leftist circle
166500	170540	than a rightist one. This is self-evident to me. The internet is a younger technology used
170540	174660	overwhelmingly by young people. Young people are more likely to be leftists and more likely to have
174660	179180	the free time to spend online engaging in viral events. But when something goes viral out of a
179180	184540	rightist circle, it's almost immediately attacked as not truly being viral, instead as being
184540	188820	astroturfed by the elites or something. For example, look at the mainstream response of
188820	192380	the Bud Light boycott. Bud Light's audience was predominantly right-wingers. Bud Light
192380	195580	pisses right-wingers off. Right-wingers stop drinking it. It's a pretty simple story to
195580	199860	understand. But the leftist narrative surrounding that event is that it's not a true consumer
199860	204220	boycott. It's not actually people rising up and voting with their wallet and having their voice
204220	209020	heard. It's that rightoids are mindless sheep directed by Matt Walsh or Tucker Carlson or
209020	213500	whoever else. It's not a true viral event. It's astroturfed by rightist talking heads.
213500	217300	Hey, when I talked about it last, I didn't say it was fake or anything. I just thought it was dumb.
217300	222820	But leftoids cannot tolerate the idea of a mass action movement from a decentralized group of
222860	227980	lowly plebs that isn't in service of leftist politics. This explains their reaction to Bud
227980	231540	Light. It explains their reaction to the Canadian trucker protests. It explains their reaction to
231540	237020	the various farmer protests. They cannot accept the idea of ground roots working-class action
237020	242300	that goes against their ideas. The reason for this is because even as socialists talk about
242300	246180	advocating for the working class, they actually hate the working class. They find them intolerable.
246180	250180	It's that Stone Toss comic where the communist refuses to shake the dirty hands of the working
250180	254540	class man. The American working class living in the countryside, working with their hands or with
254540	259020	large machinery, is from a different culture and holds different values than the American communist
259020	263820	who lives in a pod in a large city and contributes little of actual material value to society.
263820	268100	I've spoken about these people so many times in my channel. The ivory tower intellectuals,
268100	272180	the champagne socialists, the mindless progressives who believe that shaming other people is an
272180	276180	argument, the government officials who work to dismantle the lives of the very same people who
276180	280100	feed them in the pursuit of their utopia, knowing that they will have more than enough influence to
280100	284420	survive the famine they're creating. We've all seen the posts of middle-class, middle-aged white
284420	288860	women who forced their Mexican maids to vote Democrat or fire them. We've all seen the Reddit
288860	292900	addicts and the Twitterati talk about how classism is good because the working class is bigoted,
292900	298700	conservative, stoic, and likes edgy jokes. And we've all seen angry Prague's scream racial slurs
298700	321500	at non-white Republican voters. I've also done several videos on why seemingly normal things
321500	325660	are now being labeled as far-right, from working out, to going to farmers markets, to having
325660	329980	children. The left wears its tolerance like a mask. It's not truly a part of them. What
329980	334020	actually matters is loyalty to their politics. When the minority disagrees with the progressive
334020	338500	politically, they become just as vicious as any KKK member. What's happening in all of these
338500	342220	examples is the same thing as what's happening with the current left-wing disdain for rich men
342220	346100	north of Richmond, as well as try that in a small town, and the Bud Light boycott, and all the rest
346100	350460	of it. The first level of understanding is that these are instances of rightist cultural victory,
350460	354820	and the left doesn't want the right to win. In their minds, it's left good, right bad. Therefore,
354860	358660	every left cultural victory is the good guys winning, and every right cultural victory is
358660	362140	the bad guys winning. The second level is a Gramscian understanding of what's at play,
362140	365700	that when a cultural event kicks off that captures the hearts and minds of the masses,
365700	370860	if it embodies socialist politics, it can be used to inch us closer to revolution. If it embodies
370860	376060	non-socialist politics, it serves to entrench the capitalist status quo. Therefore, the working
376060	380540	class person who likes stuff like this is stifling the development of their own class consciousness.
380660	385900	The third level is that right-wing populism is actually a lot like left-wing populism,
385900	390380	so much so that people routinely cross over between them. Like I said, socialists talk
390380	394940	about the ruling class of society who apparently oppress everybody, while shrieking Nazi whenever
394940	399260	somebody who's not on the left tries to articulate the exact same idea. It's not enough that you
399260	402540	notice that there's problems with the current system. You need to articulate that problem
402540	407540	exactly as they do, and adopt their solutions, because every notion of political reform and
407540	412100	revolution is highly dangerous, destabilizing, trust-eroding, except theirs are totally cool.
412100	415860	But here's what's at the very bottom of it. Check out this Reddit post.
437540	445460	Okay, this sounds really bad, right? Well, after I explain it in detail,
445460	447060	it's going to sound a lot worse. So buckle up.
467540	473700	But Marx was wrong. Religion has always been a justification for action in and of itself.
473700	477620	The Christian Crusades, Islamic expansion, history is littered with examples of people
477620	481700	making decisions for religious reasons, where the religion did not serve to simply post hoc
481700	487700	justify some economic motive, but was in fact the primary motive. Feudal societies with agricultural
487700	492180	based modes of production have no economic incentive to venture into distant lands and
492180	495820	convert the people there, but nonetheless our history is full of this happening.
495980	500940	But this Reddit post is written through that false lens, the materialist mode of analysis.
500940	505900	The bad beliefs he's talking about, he thinks exist due to the material conditions of what he
505900	510700	calls the reactionary poor people. In other words, the culture, the practices, the beliefs of American
510700	515340	rednecks only exists due to their poverty, their geographic location, and the fact that they're
515340	520060	overwhelmingly either unemployed or blue collar workers at a business they don't own. If their
520060	524940	economic, employment, and geographic circumstances could be changed, the problematic redneck culture
524940	529100	would cease to exist, according to this guy. His solution is to force them to own a part
529100	533020	of the means of production. This is the whole worker co-op thing. Modern day socialists are
533020	537740	often market socialists, either as their ideal mode of politics or as a stepping stone towards
537740	541900	communism. Market socialism posits that all businesses should be worker cooperatives,
541900	546300	meaning owned in equal parts by all who work there. In other words, today if a shop owner
546300	550940	hires four employees to work in his shop, that's one owner and four workers. In a market socialist
550940	555900	system, the five people at the shop would all own an equal 20% of the business, regardless of
555900	560620	who initially founded it. Yes, that's a bad idea, and no I can't get into why right now. That video
560620	565100	is somewhere on my list. But this redditor's view is that working the means of production that you
565100	569500	don't own is one factor that leads to the development of these problematic redneck cultures.
569500	573980	And so, of course, the solution is to force workers to partially own the means of production
573980	577420	that they work. Let me give you an example of what this guy is proposing. Let's say that you
577420	580620	were working at a grocery store. You don't really like the job but need the money right now. You
580620	583900	don't want to stay there long term, it's just something transitional, something to get you by
583900	587020	for now because you have other plans coming down the pipe. Maybe you're moving in six months or
587020	590780	going to school or whatever. Your game plan is to keep your head down, punch in, punch out,
590780	595100	and maintain your life outside of work. The job is the least important thing going on right now.
595100	598860	This redditor would come along and say, okay, I don't like your culture and your way of life,
598860	602940	so I'm going to force you to co-own part of the grocery store company. Now all of you workers will
602940	607500	be co-managing the entire business. I theorize that this will radically change your culture and
607500	611660	way of life to be more progressive and more like me. Now, I don't think that'll ever fucking work.
611660	616620	In fact, if the job were actually transitory for you, as most part-time retail or food service jobs
616620	620380	are, I feel like it would make you hate it even more than you already do. As there's no more of
620380	625340	that keep your head down, punch in, punch out, move on shit, now part of your job is being actively
625340	629740	involved in workplace politics. It's a dumb idea, but it stems from the theory that material
629740	634380	conditions generate the culture that this guy hates, that smashing the culture is good, and so
634380	639740	forcing new material conditions upon the blue-collar, redneck working class is also good.
639740	644780	There's a book called The Theory of the Leisure Class by Thorstein Veblen. He's Norwegian,
644780	648460	by the way, with a name like that. He was a critic of capitalism, but he wasn't a socialist or a
648460	652540	fascist, despite what the name of that book might make you think. His idea was that the leisure
652540	657340	class showed off its status by engaging in leisure or by taking up employment in jobs of leisure,
657340	661100	while the working class are the people who did productive work. In his view, productive work
661100	665340	meant any labor that actually created something, whether that was food or clothing or buildings,
665340	669740	any sort of stuff that can be built and used by people. Leisure work was work that didn't
669740	674220	produce anything materially useful like that. So working in the church or being an actor or
674220	678620	playing a sport professionally or being a soldier, leisure work doesn't mean that the work is easy.
678620	682940	It's often quite hard. It simply refers to work that doesn't generate economic production.
682940	687180	Veblen theorized that because it's often hard to deduce somebody's social status at a glance,
687180	691340	especially in countries without a formal aristocratic class like the United States,
691340	696300	status symbols are used to signal class. If you could afford to work leisure work or better yet
696300	701100	own leisure works products, you were high class. Yeah, this seems obvious to us now in 2023. A
701100	706300	Bugatti is a status symbol. We get it. But Veblen wrote this in 1899. He was the first to codify the
706300	711660	idea. The upper class wears delicate restrictive clothing like suits or gowns because they can
711660	715180	afford to. It's not comfortable or durable, but that's okay. They can just buy more if they have
715180	719660	to. The upper class engages in time consuming expensive sports because they can afford to.
719660	725020	A sport like golf or fox hunting or whatever produces no actual economic utility. Only people
725020	729420	with wealth have the time to learn something with no practical use. Having a wife who doesn't work,
729420	733580	having servants, these are also signs of affluence. These are all things that poor people
733580	738140	can't do. So doing them signals your status and therefore rich people do them whether they like
738140	742380	them or not. It's also why poor people who have a couple of steps ahead of the rest of the poor
742380	746620	often try to chase the signals without actually gaining wealth. There's a biological basis for
746620	751740	this too. The biologist Amos Sahavi proposed in a study that some animals evolved to display for
751740	755900	potential mates specifically because these displays are costly to maintain. The obvious
755900	759820	example is the peacock's tail. You'd think something like this would make it very easy
759820	764220	for the peacock to be spotted by a predator. Therefore, only a healthy fit bird is capable
764220	768460	of growing such a tail while still evading predators. Many animal mating rituals involve
768460	772220	the pointless expenditure of energy and resources, likely to signal to potential
772220	776060	mates that they have excess to spare for them and their offspring. This probably also applies
776060	779260	to humans as well, why men feel like they have to show off for women they're interested in.
779260	783020	I also can't help but wonder if this tendency also partially contributes to the upper class'
783020	787260	copious use of drugs and alcohol, like they're subconsciously trying to signal that they're so
787260	791500	fit they can inject battery acid into their veins and keep on going or something like that.
791500	795660	Of course, there's also limits to Veblen's theory. Do I play video games as a status
795660	799180	symbol to hold myself above people who can't afford video games, or do I just like to do it?
799180	803500	Do the consumers with rooms full of Funko Pops or whatever spend all that money as a status symbol,
803500	807740	or do they genuinely like those properties? Do I listen to my chiptune and electroswing music
807740	811180	to show off obscure bands like a hipster, or do I do it because I like the music?
811180	816060	I can see how the absurdity of Sam Smith-esque runway model outfits fits into Veblen's idea,
816060	820700	but I cannot for the life of me envision anybody who would actually enjoy wearing that sort of
820700	825900	thing. At some point, genuine enjoyment has to play a part in consumption. It can't all be
825900	831180	social signaling. My view of Veblen's theory is that the 21st century has brought with it a new
831180	837020	set of leisure status symbols. Now we have leisure political beliefs. It's very easy to soy out on
837020	840780	Twitter about how human lives are always more important than property and therefore you're
840780	845180	not allowed any kind of home defense when it's not their house being broken into. Or Vash or Hassan
845180	848780	speaking from their gated communities about the upcoming revolution that they themselves will
848780	853500	never partake in or suffer the effects of should it happen. Do you think your average blue collar
853500	858060	redneck knows what the fuck heteronormative means, or cultural appropriation, or cisgender,
858060	862060	or intersectionality? The smarter among them will probably intuit it out, but most of them just
862060	866380	don't have the education to get it. Progressivism has become a status symbol, the leisure political
866380	870940	beliefs you can expose to signal that you belong to the upper class. A poor kid who takes on a ton
870940	875180	of student debt to get an arts degree that allows them to spout the latest progressive talking points
875180	879660	with at least some familiarity is the equivalent of the ghetto guy who has child support to pay
879660	883980	and is about to get evicted but nonetheless spends the last of his cash on a big screen TV and a nice
883980	888780	ride he can't afford. These are lower class people trying to signal that they are on a higher class
888780	894220	than they actually are. The truly affluent will support causes like open borders or antifa riots
894220	898540	or the decriminalization of hard drugs or ethical non-monogamy because it advances their social
898540	903020	standing while not actually costing them anything because they don't have to live with the real world
903020	906940	material effects of these policies. They're never going to live in an area with a bunch of legal
906940	911100	immigrants. Their neighborhood is never going to get burned down by a BLM march. The few times this
911100	914460	actually happens, by the way, you can see their attitude take a full 180 real fucking quick.
914460	918460	They don't have to walk by hordes of zombie-like homeless people with needles sticking out of their
918460	921980	arms. They don't gotta juggle five different kids by five different fathers because they were told
921980	926860	they can have it all as a strong modern empowered woman. Even when the upper class does engage in
926860	931340	things like drug use or orgies or whatever, they have better healthcare and better education to
931340	936300	manage its effects. Degeneracy has become a status symbol because engaging in it will destroy the
936300	940780	lives of the plebs while the upper class has the resources to hold it together. The reason this
940780	945180	happened, that we shifted from luxury goods to luxury beliefs as status symbols, is because
945180	950540	liberal capitalism is so kick-ass that we solved a lot of our material problems. Things like big TVs
950540	955340	or computers or nice clothes, they're actually way more affordable now than they were decades ago.
955340	959500	When I was a kid, that one guy who had the big TV in town, he was the rich family. Those things
959500	963580	were on your five figures. Now everyone's got like a 50-incher or some shit. You can pick up
963580	967740	for a few hundred dollars. So nowadays, it's beliefs that are the status symbol. If you can
967740	972300	advocate for policy that appears to be moral by progressive standards but live isolated from its
972300	976940	material effects, you are signaling your upper class status. And as these beliefs become
976940	980780	normalized at the top, they trickle down to the bottom, becoming the dominant culture. But the
980780	986300	people at the bottom can't afford to weather their negative effects. Virtue signaling is therefore
986300	991020	class signaling. Going all the way back to that Reddit post, you can now understand what's going
991020	996060	on here. This guy is openly admitting that he wants the culture and economy to change to be
996060	1000620	in line with his morality. He knows this will destroy the working class and he views this as
1000620	1005180	a good thing because the culture and morality of the working class is something he considers evil.
1005180	1010300	This is a way for him to signal not only his virtue but his class status within his tribe.
1010300	1015580	History is filled with examples of the upper class hating the lower class. Progressivism is just a
1015580	1021260	new example in a long line of examples. And now we finally emerge back at our friend singing about
1021260	1025660	the rich men north of Richmond. It was never about class struggle or class solidarity for
1025660	1030220	the socialists. If it was, they would have forgiven him his minor trespasses of not fully
1030220	1033980	understanding the relationship between the bourgeois and the proletariat from a socialist
1033980	1037740	perspective and instead relying on his intuition that something about his world is wrong on account
1037740	1042540	of him being uneducated. Hating him is simply a way for them to signal their virtue, their class,
1042540	1046700	their in-group status to other socialists. Anyway, to wrap up his tale, the Prague's
1046700	1050780	docks a singer of the song. They revealed he's not actually a farmer working class hero, guys. He
1050780	1055420	works sales at a construction company and owns one hundred thousand dollars of land. So the whole
1055420	1058940	thing's a lie. He responded on Facebook pointing out that he dropped out of high school to get a
1058940	1062940	job. He's worked in multiple plants and paper mills in North Carolina until he injured himself
1062940	1067100	and he then transitioned to a desk job in construction. He still owes sixty thousand
1067100	1070620	dollars in the land that he lives on in his camper. So yeah, the left hates this guy. But
1070620	1074700	meanwhile, the extreme right also decided to hate him, too, because he gave this interview.
1086060	1089180	For a long time, conservatives have been trying to ditch that racist label,
1089180	1092060	saying that they're cool with everyone as long as they behave in a decent manner
1092060	1096540	and don't force themselves in anyone else. This is the mainstream American right mindset,
1096540	1100940	the libertarian leave-me-alone ethic. Rather than the left's insistence on keeping cultures
1100940	1104860	separate through denouncing cultural appropriation or demanding that non-white people get special
1104860	1109020	treatment for their cultural practices, this guy believes that anybody can come to America and be
1109020	1112860	American as long as they adhere to American values, which is what he's referring to with
1112860	1117740	the phrase melting pot. I know that's not exactly what melting pot means in a sociological sense,
1117740	1121820	but you can tell by the context that's what he's saying. Again, he's not educated. But there are
1121820	1126060	actually radical rightoids right now abandoning him for this, saying that he's sold out or he's
1126060	1130860	a fed because he's not overtly racist or something. Anyway, this cycle will happen
1130860	1135020	any time something goes viral on the right. The left will denounce it because they're supposed
1135020	1139500	to be the arbiters of popular culture. They will view it as a step backwards because their politics
1139500	1143100	aren't being privileged. And they will say this regardless of the consequences of their own
1143100	1147580	beliefs because they don't need to be worried about those consequences. The people who made
1147580	1152140	it go viral in the first place, the blue collar workers, the rednecks, the lower class, it's their
1152140	1156540	job to pay the tab on the progressive beliefs of the upper class as a part of the grand
1156540	1158620	society-wide struggle session against them.
