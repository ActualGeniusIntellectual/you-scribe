1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
So, the rightoids have found a country song with political lyrics to coalesce around.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,520
No, no, not that one. That was from a previous news cycle. I'm talking about rich men north

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,240
of Richmond. The song is a redneck working class American creed, and every leftoid who

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,260
listens to it has a very turbulent reaction. The first half of it is something that any

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:49,100
socialist can get behind. Whenever I've watched a crumbtuber react to the song,

6
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:53,540
they're actually initially into it, but all of their faces sour when they hear the second half.

7
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:22,780
This is the wrong type of populism for your average socialist. Yeah, some of them are still

8
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,500
trying to claim this song as the soul of the proletariat or whatever, but most of them have

9
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,380
moved on to decry it as a right-wing astroturf job. What's really telling is that they vehemently

10
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,220
object to the Epstein's Island reference, even though there's a fair bit of evidence regarding

11
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,740
Epstein's behaviors on that island. It's always going to be funny to me that socialists believe

12
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,780
the world is secretly controlled by the 1% who use their capital to circumvent laws and destroy

13
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,100
nations, that modern democracy is a sham meant to post hoc justify the ruling class's existence.

14
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,180
All of that populist brain rot shit. But the minute a Nazi walks in and asks about the genetics

15
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,380
of the people involved, suddenly now it's a dangerous conspiracy theory. They're all fucking

16
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,900
retarded. Anyway, the legacy media is all over this guy, talking about how the far-right loves

17
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,980
him and how his anti-government rhetoric is dangerous and everything else. Here's the thing,

18
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,620
the people writing these articles are the same people demanding their student loans be forgiven.

19
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,460
Meanwhile, you think guys like this even have a student loan? This is something I pointed out in

20
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,740
my Bidenomics video. If you print money and give it to the middle class, the resulting inflation is

21
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,180
an informal tax of that value on anybody who didn't receive the printed money. The rich might

22
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,980
not care, but the poor certainly do. If forgiving the middle class's student loans causes inflation,

23
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,220
and it might, then it's the poor people who suffer as the spending power of whatever savings

24
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,100
they might have, plummets. Here's the thing about viral phenomenon. This applies to positive trends,

25
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,660
like a song taking off, but it also applies to negative trends, like a consumer boycott.

26
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,500
Generally, when things go viral online, it's more common that it begins in a leftist circle

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,540
than a rightist one. This is self-evident to me. The internet is a younger technology used

28
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,660
overwhelmingly by young people. Young people are more likely to be leftists and more likely to have

29
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,180
the free time to spend online engaging in viral events. But when something goes viral out of a

30
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,540
rightist circle, it's almost immediately attacked as not truly being viral, instead as being

31
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,820
astroturfed by the elites or something. For example, look at the mainstream response of

32
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,380
the Bud Light boycott. Bud Light's audience was predominantly right-wingers. Bud Light

33
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,580
pisses right-wingers off. Right-wingers stop drinking it. It's a pretty simple story to

34
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,860
understand. But the leftist narrative surrounding that event is that it's not a true consumer

35
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,220
boycott. It's not actually people rising up and voting with their wallet and having their voice

36
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:29,020
heard. It's that rightoids are mindless sheep directed by Matt Walsh or Tucker Carlson or

37
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,500
whoever else. It's not a true viral event. It's astroturfed by rightist talking heads.

38
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,300
Hey, when I talked about it last, I didn't say it was fake or anything. I just thought it was dumb.

39
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,820
But leftoids cannot tolerate the idea of a mass action movement from a decentralized group of

40
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,980
lowly plebs that isn't in service of leftist politics. This explains their reaction to Bud

41
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,540
Light. It explains their reaction to the Canadian trucker protests. It explains their reaction to

42
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,020
the various farmer protests. They cannot accept the idea of ground roots working-class action

43
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,300
that goes against their ideas. The reason for this is because even as socialists talk about

44
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,180
advocating for the working class, they actually hate the working class. They find them intolerable.

45
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,180
It's that Stone Toss comic where the communist refuses to shake the dirty hands of the working

46
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,540
class man. The American working class living in the countryside, working with their hands or with

47
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,020
large machinery, is from a different culture and holds different values than the American communist

48
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,820
who lives in a pod in a large city and contributes little of actual material value to society.

49
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,100
I've spoken about these people so many times in my channel. The ivory tower intellectuals,

50
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,180
the champagne socialists, the mindless progressives who believe that shaming other people is an

51
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,180
argument, the government officials who work to dismantle the lives of the very same people who

52
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,100
feed them in the pursuit of their utopia, knowing that they will have more than enough influence to

53
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,420
survive the famine they're creating. We've all seen the posts of middle-class, middle-aged white

54
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,860
women who forced their Mexican maids to vote Democrat or fire them. We've all seen the Reddit

55
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,900
addicts and the Twitterati talk about how classism is good because the working class is bigoted,

56
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:58,700
conservative, stoic, and likes edgy jokes. And we've all seen angry Prague's scream racial slurs

57
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:21,500
at non-white Republican voters. I've also done several videos on why seemingly normal things

58
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,660
are now being labeled as far-right, from working out, to going to farmers markets, to having

59
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,980
children. The left wears its tolerance like a mask. It's not truly a part of them. What

60
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,020
actually matters is loyalty to their politics. When the minority disagrees with the progressive

61
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,500
politically, they become just as vicious as any KKK member. What's happening in all of these

62
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,220
examples is the same thing as what's happening with the current left-wing disdain for rich men

63
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,100
north of Richmond, as well as try that in a small town, and the Bud Light boycott, and all the rest

64
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,460
of it. The first level of understanding is that these are instances of rightist cultural victory,

65
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,820
and the left doesn't want the right to win. In their minds, it's left good, right bad. Therefore,

66
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,660
every left cultural victory is the good guys winning, and every right cultural victory is

67
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,140
the bad guys winning. The second level is a Gramscian understanding of what's at play,

68
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,700
that when a cultural event kicks off that captures the hearts and minds of the masses,

69
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,860
if it embodies socialist politics, it can be used to inch us closer to revolution. If it embodies

70
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,060
non-socialist politics, it serves to entrench the capitalist status quo. Therefore, the working

71
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,540
class person who likes stuff like this is stifling the development of their own class consciousness.

72
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,900
The third level is that right-wing populism is actually a lot like left-wing populism,

73
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,380
so much so that people routinely cross over between them. Like I said, socialists talk

74
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,940
about the ruling class of society who apparently oppress everybody, while shrieking Nazi whenever

75
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,260
somebody who's not on the left tries to articulate the exact same idea. It's not enough that you

76
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,540
notice that there's problems with the current system. You need to articulate that problem

77
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,540
exactly as they do, and adopt their solutions, because every notion of political reform and

78
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,100
revolution is highly dangerous, destabilizing, trust-eroding, except theirs are totally cool.

79
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,860
But here's what's at the very bottom of it. Check out this Reddit post.

80
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:25,460
Okay, this sounds really bad, right? Well, after I explain it in detail,

81
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,060
it's going to sound a lot worse. So buckle up.

82
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,700
But Marx was wrong. Religion has always been a justification for action in and of itself.

83
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,620
The Christian Crusades, Islamic expansion, history is littered with examples of people

84
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,700
making decisions for religious reasons, where the religion did not serve to simply post hoc

85
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:07,700
justify some economic motive, but was in fact the primary motive. Feudal societies with agricultural

86
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,180
based modes of production have no economic incentive to venture into distant lands and

87
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,820
convert the people there, but nonetheless our history is full of this happening.

88
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,940
But this Reddit post is written through that false lens, the materialist mode of analysis.

89
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,900
The bad beliefs he's talking about, he thinks exist due to the material conditions of what he

90
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,700
calls the reactionary poor people. In other words, the culture, the practices, the beliefs of American

91
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,340
rednecks only exists due to their poverty, their geographic location, and the fact that they're

92
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,060
overwhelmingly either unemployed or blue collar workers at a business they don't own. If their

93
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,940
economic, employment, and geographic circumstances could be changed, the problematic redneck culture

94
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,100
would cease to exist, according to this guy. His solution is to force them to own a part

95
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,020
of the means of production. This is the whole worker co-op thing. Modern day socialists are

96
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,740
often market socialists, either as their ideal mode of politics or as a stepping stone towards

97
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,900
communism. Market socialism posits that all businesses should be worker cooperatives,

98
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,300
meaning owned in equal parts by all who work there. In other words, today if a shop owner

99
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,940
hires four employees to work in his shop, that's one owner and four workers. In a market socialist

100
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,900
system, the five people at the shop would all own an equal 20% of the business, regardless of

101
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,620
who initially founded it. Yes, that's a bad idea, and no I can't get into why right now. That video

102
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,100
is somewhere on my list. But this redditor's view is that working the means of production that you

103
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,500
don't own is one factor that leads to the development of these problematic redneck cultures.

104
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,980
And so, of course, the solution is to force workers to partially own the means of production

105
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,420
that they work. Let me give you an example of what this guy is proposing. Let's say that you

106
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,620
were working at a grocery store. You don't really like the job but need the money right now. You

107
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,900
don't want to stay there long term, it's just something transitional, something to get you by

108
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,020
for now because you have other plans coming down the pipe. Maybe you're moving in six months or

109
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,780
going to school or whatever. Your game plan is to keep your head down, punch in, punch out,

110
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,100
and maintain your life outside of work. The job is the least important thing going on right now.

111
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,860
This redditor would come along and say, okay, I don't like your culture and your way of life,

112
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,940
so I'm going to force you to co-own part of the grocery store company. Now all of you workers will

113
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,500
be co-managing the entire business. I theorize that this will radically change your culture and

114
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,660
way of life to be more progressive and more like me. Now, I don't think that'll ever fucking work.

115
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,620
In fact, if the job were actually transitory for you, as most part-time retail or food service jobs

116
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,380
are, I feel like it would make you hate it even more than you already do. As there's no more of

117
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:25,340
that keep your head down, punch in, punch out, move on shit, now part of your job is being actively

118
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,740
involved in workplace politics. It's a dumb idea, but it stems from the theory that material

119
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,380
conditions generate the culture that this guy hates, that smashing the culture is good, and so

120
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,740
forcing new material conditions upon the blue-collar, redneck working class is also good.

121
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,780
There's a book called The Theory of the Leisure Class by Thorstein Veblen. He's Norwegian,

122
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,460
by the way, with a name like that. He was a critic of capitalism, but he wasn't a socialist or a

123
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,540
fascist, despite what the name of that book might make you think. His idea was that the leisure

124
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,340
class showed off its status by engaging in leisure or by taking up employment in jobs of leisure,

125
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,100
while the working class are the people who did productive work. In his view, productive work

126
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,340
meant any labor that actually created something, whether that was food or clothing or buildings,

127
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,740
any sort of stuff that can be built and used by people. Leisure work was work that didn't

128
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,220
produce anything materially useful like that. So working in the church or being an actor or

129
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,620
playing a sport professionally or being a soldier, leisure work doesn't mean that the work is easy.

130
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,940
It's often quite hard. It simply refers to work that doesn't generate economic production.

131
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,180
Veblen theorized that because it's often hard to deduce somebody's social status at a glance,

132
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,340
especially in countries without a formal aristocratic class like the United States,

133
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,300
status symbols are used to signal class. If you could afford to work leisure work or better yet

134
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,100
own leisure works products, you were high class. Yeah, this seems obvious to us now in 2023. A

135
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,300
Bugatti is a status symbol. We get it. But Veblen wrote this in 1899. He was the first to codify the

136
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,660
idea. The upper class wears delicate restrictive clothing like suits or gowns because they can

137
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,180
afford to. It's not comfortable or durable, but that's okay. They can just buy more if they have

138
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:59,660
to. The upper class engages in time consuming expensive sports because they can afford to.

139
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:05,020
A sport like golf or fox hunting or whatever produces no actual economic utility. Only people

140
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,420
with wealth have the time to learn something with no practical use. Having a wife who doesn't work,

141
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,580
having servants, these are also signs of affluence. These are all things that poor people

142
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,140
can't do. So doing them signals your status and therefore rich people do them whether they like

143
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,380
them or not. It's also why poor people who have a couple of steps ahead of the rest of the poor

144
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,620
often try to chase the signals without actually gaining wealth. There's a biological basis for

145
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,740
this too. The biologist Amos Sahavi proposed in a study that some animals evolved to display for

146
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,900
potential mates specifically because these displays are costly to maintain. The obvious

147
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,820
example is the peacock's tail. You'd think something like this would make it very easy

148
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,220
for the peacock to be spotted by a predator. Therefore, only a healthy fit bird is capable

149
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,460
of growing such a tail while still evading predators. Many animal mating rituals involve

150
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,220
the pointless expenditure of energy and resources, likely to signal to potential

151
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,060
mates that they have excess to spare for them and their offspring. This probably also applies

152
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,260
to humans as well, why men feel like they have to show off for women they're interested in.

153
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,020
I also can't help but wonder if this tendency also partially contributes to the upper class'

154
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,260
copious use of drugs and alcohol, like they're subconsciously trying to signal that they're so

155
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,500
fit they can inject battery acid into their veins and keep on going or something like that.

156
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,660
Of course, there's also limits to Veblen's theory. Do I play video games as a status

157
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,180
symbol to hold myself above people who can't afford video games, or do I just like to do it?

158
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,500
Do the consumers with rooms full of Funko Pops or whatever spend all that money as a status symbol,

159
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,740
or do they genuinely like those properties? Do I listen to my chiptune and electroswing music

160
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,180
to show off obscure bands like a hipster, or do I do it because I like the music?

161
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,060
I can see how the absurdity of Sam Smith-esque runway model outfits fits into Veblen's idea,

162
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,700
but I cannot for the life of me envision anybody who would actually enjoy wearing that sort of

163
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,900
thing. At some point, genuine enjoyment has to play a part in consumption. It can't all be

164
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:51,180
social signaling. My view of Veblen's theory is that the 21st century has brought with it a new

165
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:57,020
set of leisure status symbols. Now we have leisure political beliefs. It's very easy to soy out on

166
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,780
Twitter about how human lives are always more important than property and therefore you're

167
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,180
not allowed any kind of home defense when it's not their house being broken into. Or Vash or Hassan

168
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,780
speaking from their gated communities about the upcoming revolution that they themselves will

169
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,500
never partake in or suffer the effects of should it happen. Do you think your average blue collar

170
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,060
redneck knows what the fuck heteronormative means, or cultural appropriation, or cisgender,

171
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,060
or intersectionality? The smarter among them will probably intuit it out, but most of them just

172
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,380
don't have the education to get it. Progressivism has become a status symbol, the leisure political

173
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,940
beliefs you can expose to signal that you belong to the upper class. A poor kid who takes on a ton

174
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,180
of student debt to get an arts degree that allows them to spout the latest progressive talking points

175
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,660
with at least some familiarity is the equivalent of the ghetto guy who has child support to pay

176
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,980
and is about to get evicted but nonetheless spends the last of his cash on a big screen TV and a nice

177
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,780
ride he can't afford. These are lower class people trying to signal that they are on a higher class

178
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:54,220
than they actually are. The truly affluent will support causes like open borders or antifa riots

179
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,540
or the decriminalization of hard drugs or ethical non-monogamy because it advances their social

180
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,020
standing while not actually costing them anything because they don't have to live with the real world

181
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,940
material effects of these policies. They're never going to live in an area with a bunch of legal

182
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,100
immigrants. Their neighborhood is never going to get burned down by a BLM march. The few times this

183
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,460
actually happens, by the way, you can see their attitude take a full 180 real fucking quick.

184
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,460
They don't have to walk by hordes of zombie-like homeless people with needles sticking out of their

185
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,980
arms. They don't gotta juggle five different kids by five different fathers because they were told

186
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,860
they can have it all as a strong modern empowered woman. Even when the upper class does engage in

187
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,340
things like drug use or orgies or whatever, they have better healthcare and better education to

188
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:36,300
manage its effects. Degeneracy has become a status symbol because engaging in it will destroy the

189
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,780
lives of the plebs while the upper class has the resources to hold it together. The reason this

190
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,180
happened, that we shifted from luxury goods to luxury beliefs as status symbols, is because

191
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:50,540
liberal capitalism is so kick-ass that we solved a lot of our material problems. Things like big TVs

192
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,340
or computers or nice clothes, they're actually way more affordable now than they were decades ago.

193
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,500
When I was a kid, that one guy who had the big TV in town, he was the rich family. Those things

194
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,580
were on your five figures. Now everyone's got like a 50-incher or some shit. You can pick up

195
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,740
for a few hundred dollars. So nowadays, it's beliefs that are the status symbol. If you can

196
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,300
advocate for policy that appears to be moral by progressive standards but live isolated from its

197
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,940
material effects, you are signaling your upper class status. And as these beliefs become

198
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,780
normalized at the top, they trickle down to the bottom, becoming the dominant culture. But the

199
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:26,300
people at the bottom can't afford to weather their negative effects. Virtue signaling is therefore

200
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,020
class signaling. Going all the way back to that Reddit post, you can now understand what's going

201
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,060
on here. This guy is openly admitting that he wants the culture and economy to change to be

202
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,620
in line with his morality. He knows this will destroy the working class and he views this as

203
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,180
a good thing because the culture and morality of the working class is something he considers evil.

204
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,300
This is a way for him to signal not only his virtue but his class status within his tribe.

205
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:55,580
History is filled with examples of the upper class hating the lower class. Progressivism is just a

206
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:01,260
new example in a long line of examples. And now we finally emerge back at our friend singing about

207
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,660
the rich men north of Richmond. It was never about class struggle or class solidarity for

208
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,220
the socialists. If it was, they would have forgiven him his minor trespasses of not fully

209
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,980
understanding the relationship between the bourgeois and the proletariat from a socialist

210
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,740
perspective and instead relying on his intuition that something about his world is wrong on account

211
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,540
of him being uneducated. Hating him is simply a way for them to signal their virtue, their class,

212
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,700
their in-group status to other socialists. Anyway, to wrap up his tale, the Prague's

213
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,780
docks a singer of the song. They revealed he's not actually a farmer working class hero, guys. He

214
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,420
works sales at a construction company and owns one hundred thousand dollars of land. So the whole

215
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,940
thing's a lie. He responded on Facebook pointing out that he dropped out of high school to get a

216
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,940
job. He's worked in multiple plants and paper mills in North Carolina until he injured himself

217
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,100
and he then transitioned to a desk job in construction. He still owes sixty thousand

218
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,620
dollars in the land that he lives on in his camper. So yeah, the left hates this guy. But

219
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,700
meanwhile, the extreme right also decided to hate him, too, because he gave this interview.

220
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,180
For a long time, conservatives have been trying to ditch that racist label,

221
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,060
saying that they're cool with everyone as long as they behave in a decent manner

222
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,540
and don't force themselves in anyone else. This is the mainstream American right mindset,

223
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,940
the libertarian leave-me-alone ethic. Rather than the left's insistence on keeping cultures

224
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,860
separate through denouncing cultural appropriation or demanding that non-white people get special

225
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,020
treatment for their cultural practices, this guy believes that anybody can come to America and be

226
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,860
American as long as they adhere to American values, which is what he's referring to with

227
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,740
the phrase melting pot. I know that's not exactly what melting pot means in a sociological sense,

228
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,820
but you can tell by the context that's what he's saying. Again, he's not educated. But there are

229
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,060
actually radical rightoids right now abandoning him for this, saying that he's sold out or he's

230
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,860
a fed because he's not overtly racist or something. Anyway, this cycle will happen

231
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,020
any time something goes viral on the right. The left will denounce it because they're supposed

232
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,500
to be the arbiters of popular culture. They will view it as a step backwards because their politics

233
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,100
aren't being privileged. And they will say this regardless of the consequences of their own

234
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,580
beliefs because they don't need to be worried about those consequences. The people who made

235
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,140
it go viral in the first place, the blue collar workers, the rednecks, the lower class, it's their

236
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,540
job to pay the tab on the progressive beliefs of the upper class as a part of the grand

237
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,620
society-wide struggle session against them.
