0	5120	Welcome to Trailer Talk and we watch movies and we're actually about to go in and see
5120	14560	Star Trek Into Darkness and this time I won't be going on at length because unlike Lord
14560	17720	of the Rings I am not really a Star Trek fanboy.
17720	18720	I like the shows.
18720	20240	I'm a Star Trek fanboy.
20240	21240	More than me.
21240	22640	Definitely more than me.
22640	28120	But yeah, watched a few of the series, if I could go back and watch Next Generation
28120	29120	I probably will.
29120	30120	It's on Netflix.
30120	36080	But anyways, the original series, never watched that much but it seeped our culture so god
36080	39720	damn much that this is, it is a cultural phenomenon.
39720	42200	How much have you heard of the movie?
42200	43200	Not much other than...
43200	44280	You've been avoiding all the spoilers?
44280	47260	I've been avoiding everything about it.
47260	52000	This is probably going up tomorrow but we're watching it on Tuesday and it came out last
52000	53000	Friday.
53000	54000	Yeah.
54000	55000	Cheap night.
55000	58080	Yeah, it's cheap on Tuesday so we're going on Tuesday night.
58080	59880	No service heading.
59880	68600	But like, I have looked up some stuff and I mean, for the longest time, up to a year
68600	73920	before this fucking thing was being hyped, everyone's like no no, Benedict Cumberbatch
73920	75280	is not Khan.
75280	76280	He's not Khan.
76280	81320	They have a new villain, they're not doing Wrath of Khan again, he's fucking Khan.
81320	85640	And I'm not saying I read a spoiler, I'm saying he's fucking Khan.
86320	89000	They are going to be that stupid and make him Khan.
89000	90320	I think.
90320	94560	Um, I could have sworn that he was supposed to be like a...
94560	99760	I thought you said something like from an original series episode.
99760	100760	An original series episode.
100760	102960	It was like a psychic guy and yeah yeah.
102960	107400	I heard that too but I really think they're gonna...
107400	108400	You know what?
108400	109400	You know what?
109400	111120	He can't be any worse than Eric Bana was.
111120	114840	I'm sorry but I like Eric Bana.
114840	119000	He's pretty decent in some movies but as, I don't even remember the fucking character's
119000	120000	name.
120000	121000	Nero.
121000	122000	Nero, right.
122000	123000	He was Nero.
123000	124000	As Nero.
124000	128120	I didn't really find him very believable and I really, I didn't find him very likable.
128120	129120	I mean.
129120	130120	He wasn't supposed to be likable.
130120	131120	He was supposed to be just massive.
131120	136400	I know, I know, he's like, but there's usually some kind of redeeming trait in a villain,
136400	139920	especially now they're making him more complex.
139920	145660	When The Dark Knight came out, it started this sort of trend in movies marketed towards
145660	153400	our generation, our demographic, where the villain had to be somebody who was hardcore,
153400	158360	he was a one man army, and he would destabilize social order.
158360	159760	That had to be a thing.
159760	160760	The Joker did it.
160760	161760	Yeah.
161760	162760	They tried to...
162760	163760	An agent of chaos basically.
163760	164840	They tried to recreate it with Bane.
164840	169760	They tried to do it in Iron Man 3 with the Mandarin.
169760	170760	And that fucking sucked.
170760	173540	I haven't seen it yet.
173540	178940	The only Star Trek character that has that agent of chaos flavor to him is Khan.
178940	184000	This trailer, all the trailers, which were really good trailers by the way, they are
184000	188500	all very much a destabilizing social order type of movie.
188500	189840	So it's going to be fucking Khan.
189840	190840	All right.
190840	191840	Well.
191840	196160	We're going to figure this, Dev, you're going on it like, we're going to actually go watch
196160	197160	the movie.
197160	198160	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
198160	199160	We're going to actually go watch the movie.
199560	203560	We're going to come back later and we're going to actually discuss whether or not the shit
203560	205400	actually went down or not.
205400	209080	And hopefully I'll be putting Dev in his place because he seems to have this complete mindset
209080	210720	it's going to be a piece of shit.
210720	211720	And I think it's going to be great.
211720	212720	I do think it's going to be great.
212720	217400	But really, I'm going in and this time he's the hardcore, I'm the casual, I'm going in
217400	220360	thinking, okay, I'm going to go in for a great popcorn flick.
220360	223920	I'm not going to eat popcorn, but it's going to be a popcorn type flick.
223920	228960	It's just going to be guns and action and punching and fucking green aliens and whatever
228960	231860	you can say about Star Trek the original series.
231860	233480	It's going to be good.
233480	235280	That's my prediction.
235280	238680	You heard Dev, he thinks it's going to be a piece of shit or trite.
238680	245640	I think it's going to be a very poor man's dark knight set in the Star Trek universe.
245640	248000	Alright, you have our predictions.
248000	250040	And we'll see you after the movie.
250040	251720	Oh, guess what?
251720	254800	I guarantee you, Cumberbatch is con.
254800	258360	Cumberbatch was con.
258360	262240	Cumberbatch was con.
262240	263720	Looks like I was wrong, guys.
263720	272000	Yeah, everything I said in the start, line for line, the fucking chaos thing, the con
272000	276040	thing, it was, I was right, was I not?
276040	277040	It's true.
277040	278440	It's true.
278440	280560	He called it number two.
280560	282880	I was just kind of hoping they wouldn't be exploiting that.
282880	287600	But I don't know, I thought overall it was a great movie.
287600	293540	Yeah, that John Harrison name that con used as a pseudonym, that was the name of the psychic
293540	296360	guy from the fucking original series.
296360	299800	Alright, well, we got to throw back.
299800	305800	Those assholes could have actually made a good half decent, not original, but at least
305800	310100	original in the sense that you're not going to use the obvious villain.
310100	312500	But no, it's fucking con.
312500	314500	It's just fucking con.
314500	315500	Yeah.
315500	325340	And then they fucking, they pull scenes from Wrath of Khan word for word.
325340	326900	And they just flip things around.
326900	328140	I don't remember that much.
328140	332260	I mean, we were talking about the whole thing after the movie and I was like, you know what,
332260	335540	man, I don't really remember what the whole thing with con was other than he was like...
335540	336540	Did you watch Wrath of Khan?
336540	337540	Yes, I did.
337540	338540	Yeah?
338540	340580	It's been four years or something, or four or five years now.
340580	342860	So I don't remember it overly well.
342860	348500	All I remembered was con was like a genetically superior being and he was really pissed at
348500	351940	the Federation, or not the Federation, the Starfleet.
351940	356700	And you know, he was in exile.
356700	364220	Yeah, in the original, he was a addict in the 1990s, his rulers, his leadership just
364220	368020	basically failed and like him and his genetic superiors had to run away and they got frozen
368020	369020	in space.
369020	371020	Yeah, they're war criminals apparently.
371020	372020	Yeah.
372020	378340	And then basically what happened was that Kirk finds him 300 years later, they kind
378340	381340	of fight it out for a while in the Enterprise and then con's like...
381340	382340	Re-adactment.
382340	387100	Oh no, I'm gonna be frozen again.
387100	391580	Con is like, I'm gonna fucking go to this new planet and settle it because you know,
391580	392580	here's a good challenge for you guys.
392580	394820	Kirk's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you go off and you do that.
394820	400060	So he goes there and then between the course of the original series and then the Wrath
400060	405300	of Khan movie, something gets fucked up on the planet and it turns into a giant Tatooine
405300	410260	and then basically, con's like, fuck this shit, Kirk fucked me over, I want my revenge
410260	412220	and the entire Wrath of Khan movie is revenge.
412220	419380	But in this one, they started this new movie series with the intention that you wouldn't
419380	421700	have to actually be a Star Trek fan.
421700	422940	That's true.
422940	426020	And they don't explain who Khan is, they don't explain where he comes from, they don't explain
426020	429380	what his deal is, they don't even give him a motivation.
429380	430380	They...
430380	432100	Well no, that's not true.
432100	434260	He's just there to be a weaselly shit.
434260	435980	That is not entirely true.
435980	442340	Now he does admit that he's got, okay, spoiler alert here, there are...
442340	443660	Spoiler alert, it's Khan.
443660	446820	Yeah, no, no, no, there are these proton...
446820	447820	Photon?
447820	448820	Photon.
448820	449820	Photon torpedoes.
449820	450820	Photon torpedoes.
450820	455300	Yeah, I know, proton, photon, whatever, it's all sci-fi to me.
455300	457300	Just kidding, I love Star Wars.
457300	458300	Anyways.
458300	460300	There's all these torpedoes and in terms of...
460300	462300	I'm a big fan of Babylon 5 myself.
462300	464140	Oh my god, I love Babylon 5.
464140	465140	Shut up.
465140	466140	Okay, anyways.
466140	471060	They have these torpedoes, it turns out that, plot twist, that actually contains the other
471060	485980	72 members of his crew and that this admiral is actually, well, yeah, he's being used.
485980	490180	He is a war criminal, he doesn't have a vendetta against Kirk, not yet.
490180	492140	This could be definitely used more.
492140	494500	Yeah, because Khan's arrived, see, he gets...
494500	495980	He gets cryogenically frozen in the end.
495980	497180	Yeah, at the end he gets frozen.
497180	498940	So there you go, he's in stasis.
498940	501820	He could text someone, someone could bring him back, somehow or another.
501820	503580	They could just keep the Khan story going.
503580	504580	But they could.
504580	509940	Okay, here's what I don't like, is that, yeah, okay, they could have had the John Harrison
509940	514340	or was it Morrison, whatever, they could have had an actual good storyline and they go,
514340	516740	nope, I'm Khan, actually, yoop-a-doop.
516740	519780	Okay, that sucks, but fine, Khan's on the scene.
519780	520780	Woo-hoo.
520780	521780	Khan to the rescue.
521780	528720	What I don't like is how, you know, they did the Spock sacrifices himself to save the ship
528720	529720	thing.
529720	530720	Oh, they flip-flopped that.
530720	537700	But they did it with Kirk sacrificing himself to save the ship, and then down to the fucking
537700	540560	exact same lines from that scene.
540560	541560	It wasn't.
541560	542560	It was pretty fucking close.
542560	543560	It was close?
543560	544560	It changed like three words.
544560	545560	It was close.
545560	546560	I got choked up, I gotta say.
546560	548880	I did not, I was just thinking, they're fucking...
548880	550000	You don't choke up at anything.
550000	554000	I was looking at this thing and I was like, they're just stealing it from that thing.
554000	556040	Did you get choked up by the original scene?
556040	557960	Yes, because that was fucking original.
558200	561200	Well, yeah, it's a reboot.
561200	562200	That's the thing.
562200	563200	Here's the thing.
563200	564200	Here's the thing.
564200	568280	And then, of course, they had to add in the Khan scream at the end.
568280	569280	That actually, I...
569280	572760	That was fucking hilariously stupid.
572760	573760	I loved it.
573760	574760	Hearing Spock scream Khan.
574760	580080	I did think it was hilarious, but I thought it was actually, at least, it was lovely.
580080	587320	But that is such a point of contention, just because Spock, even in the conversation between
587360	592200	young Spock and old Spock, because old Spock shows up again.
592200	594880	I said, okay, there's a couple of niggles in this movie.
594880	595880	That's one of them.
595880	596880	Old Spock.
596880	601320	It made sense in the first one for old Spock to show up because they're doing the time
601320	604760	reboot thing and he's like, I'm actually the Spock from the future and now the timeline's
604760	605760	different.
605760	606760	He shouldn't have been in this one.
606760	607760	No.
607760	608760	No.
608760	609760	Overused.
609760	613720	Spock calls up old Spock and he's like, hey, how do we beat Khan in the last movie?
613720	615440	And Spock's like, well...
615440	617120	I really shouldn't tell you.
617120	618440	But I'm going to tell you how we did it.
618440	621200	I'm going to tell you anyways.
621200	624560	And then Spock's like, okay, thanks, and then just goes and fucking puts in this planted
624560	627720	emotion that fucking destroys Khan.
627720	631400	Even the conversation, though, between them, it really showed the difference between old
631400	633600	Spock and the new Spock.
633600	640400	The new Spock is considerably more humanized already than old Spock, the original Spock.
640400	645160	I never found Spock or the Vulcan race in general to be non-human.
645160	647280	I just found them to be the better parts of our nature.
647280	651040	I found them to be our rational sides.
651040	652520	Spoken like a true autistic.
652520	656080	No, no, I'm serious.
656080	661840	There is something to be said about human intellect and its virtues and having a race
661840	663920	in science fiction that represents that.
663920	668160	I don't see them as mindless robots as Kirk and everyone else calls them.
668160	669160	I just think...
669160	670160	No.
670160	672080	No, no.
672080	674800	Even Spock calls them on it, though.
674840	679320	He says you're being defensive because you know I'm right.
679320	681720	That's the way it goes.
681720	685920	That's how the reactive human nature is, a human emotion.
685920	688400	You call me out on something, I'm going to come back at you.
688400	693480	It's not going to necessarily be logical, but it's going to be geared towards making
693480	696040	you feel bad about yourself.
696040	700400	But then again, Spock doesn't feel bad about himself.
700400	701400	Not really, no.
701400	702840	He feels bad about the things that have happened.
702880	706080	I'm just reminded of this fucking porn I watched.
706080	707680	It was a Star Trek porn.
707680	713920	And it was like, I think it was Jenna Hayes actually, she was like, she was sucking off
713920	715360	this Spock stand in.
715360	719600	She's like, I am this space babe who has like an extremely, I've been genetically modified
719600	722920	I have an extremely high libido and I'm going to suck off this Vulcan.
722920	726240	And she's like giving this most voracious blowjob and Spock's just standing there, he's
726240	729840	like, he like raises the eyebrows, he's like, fascinating.
729840	733920	See, that's what I'm looking for.
733920	744480	I'm sorry, don't get me wrong, I love the series so far, the actors, I think they've
744480	748760	been well picked, despite what Dev's dad thinks about Chris Pine, I still think he's pretty
748760	749760	solid.
749760	751400	Yeah, my dad doesn't like Chris Pine, but...
751400	754480	He can be a little, if you can pardon the pun, wooden at times.
754480	758000	He has a fatter neck.
758000	762080	He beefed up for this role and his neck got wider as a result, compared to the first Star
762080	763080	Trek.
763080	764080	Wow, that's been four years.
764080	765080	Yeah, that's true.
765080	766080	Yeah, so, a lot of changes.
766080	768280	But no, all the acting choices were fine.
768280	769880	Acting choices were fine, I thought the script...
769880	772560	Except, except for fucking Khan, again.
772560	773560	Of course.
773560	774560	Okay, okay.
774560	778400	Khan, he was played by a Spanish actor with dark skin, and he was supposed to be...
778400	779400	Ricardo Montalban.
779400	780400	And he was supposed to be an heir.
780400	781400	From Fancy Island.
781400	782400	Ah, fucking lights, hold on.
782400	785600	You have to close the door and reopen it.
785600	787840	I understand your pain, Brad.
787880	792240	Khan's character was supposed to be an Arab, and the actor was dark skinned, and he had
792240	794240	a Spanish accent, and everything was good.
794240	795240	Yeah, it was...
795240	796240	But...
796240	797240	Well, Moors, yeah.
797240	798240	But...
798240	799240	This guy's white.
799240	805080	Oh, and not just, like, kinda white, like super white, like British white, like pasty
805080	806080	white.
806080	807080	And he has a British accent.
807080	808080	Like, Khan is supposed to be an Arab.
808080	810080	Benedict Cumberbatch.
810080	815160	How can you get more, the only British, more British name I ever saw, other than that,
815160	818160	was Alastair T.S. Summerley.
818160	819160	What's that from?
819160	823280	He was one of the, like, vice, I think he was like vice dean of University of Guelph
823280	826560	or something, when my sister graduated.
826560	828880	That is the most English name I've ever seen.
828880	833560	Yeah, Cumberbatch fucking enters the movie in this helicopter shooting up a conference
833560	836160	room, just fucking sipping tea in a monocle.
836160	837160	Like he...
837160	840680	Not really.
840680	844320	He's a good actor, but he's miscast.
844320	845320	He's not Khan.
845320	848840	He didn't look like Khan, he didn't act like Khan, he didn't speak like Khan, he didn't
848840	850920	do anything that Khan would have done.
850920	851920	He's not Khan.
851920	853520	Yeah, musically speaking, excellent.
853520	859400	I was, like, the first movie, and most of this movie, used that same kind of musical
859400	860400	riff with...
860400	861400	You know what I'm talking about.
861400	862400	Yeah, it's a score.
862400	864480	Yeah, but it was all kind of classically...
864480	868240	Yeah, yeah, yeah, you don't need to hum it.
868240	873080	But I like how they actually included some kind of choir for the Klingon scenes.
873080	874080	Yeah.
874840	877240	The Klingons, they did really well.
877240	879720	The Klingons were fucking badass.
879720	880720	These were the first...
880720	882720	Except when they got killed.
882720	884000	They were the...
884000	889080	The Birds of Prey looked amazing, the Klingon, the actual makeup for the Klingons and the
889080	891720	way they were characterized looked amazing.
891720	894400	These were the best Klingons we have seen in Star Trek.
894400	895400	And they're all black.
895400	896640	They're supposed to be.
896640	897640	Are they?
897640	898640	Yeah.
898640	899640	Klingons are...
899640	900640	I thought that was kind of like a...
900640	903400	Well, I know in the original series they are.
903400	904400	That's true.
904400	907640	Klingons are all light, like pan-skinned and really dark.
907640	908640	All of them?
908640	909640	Yeah, all of them.
909640	910640	Fuck.
910640	911640	I thought there was a couple...
911640	914160	In the original series there, there were Klingons without the head ridges and they were a little
914160	915160	bit lighter.
915160	921360	And that was actually explained in an episode of, I think, Enterprise, where they go back...
921360	922360	Are they all binos?
922360	923360	No, no.
923360	929080	There's a fucking disease that is made out of human DNA that infects the Klingons and
929080	932920	changes them to have a partially human genome so they don't have the ridges anymore.
932920	937640	It was basically just them trying to explain why the makeup back in the 60s sucked.
937640	939160	The music was great.
939160	940160	Klingons were great.
940160	943680	The CG work in these kind of movies is always going to be fucking spectacular.
943680	944680	Fucking fantastic.
944680	950880	Yeah, it is a spectacle of a movie and it's a great ride, but the minute you actually
950880	955400	step out of the theater and start thinking about what the fuck went on, it all just fucking
955400	956400	falls apart.
956400	959080	Don't approach this as a hardcore Star Trek fan.
959080	963040	Approach it as an average theatergoer.
963040	965340	Try to keep that mindset.
965340	971140	Take your brain, take your frontal lobe and just kind of just throw it in the garbage
971140	974760	for a couple of hours.
974760	976560	The last thing to mention would be the ending.
976560	982080	Let me set this up for you, alright?
982080	984680	Khan has failed, alright?
984680	985680	His name is Khan.
985680	989160	And his ship crashes into London and by the way...
989160	990800	It's not London, San Francisco.
990800	991800	It's London.
991800	992800	No.
992800	993800	It's supposed to be San Francisco.
993800	997040	In the original series, the headquarters of Starfleet was San Francisco.
997040	998040	In this movie, it's London.
998040	999920	They just fucked it up, but...
999920	1001720	But it said San Francisco.
1001720	1002720	It said London.
1002720	1003720	What?
1003720	1006840	It said London on the fucking screen and it even says there was an attack in London yesterday.
1006840	1007840	It's all London.
1007840	1008840	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
1008840	1010760	The initial attack.
1010760	1011760	Crashes into the city.
1011760	1012760	Okay, fine.
1012760	1013760	This...
1013760	1014760	And things explode.
1014840	1015840	Starfleet.
1015840	1020880	And tons of people die, shit's going down and then Cumberbatch gets away by putting
1020880	1021880	on a trench coat.
1021880	1025320	This is the only time he actually wears the trench coat that he fucking had in the trailer.
1025320	1026320	Trench coat mafia.
1026320	1028640	And in the fucking... the posters and everything.
1028640	1031040	He puts it on in the last five minutes of the movie and he runs through the city and
1031040	1032520	Spock chases after him.
1032520	1036080	And they do this hop between flying cars and beat the shit out of each other.
1036080	1039080	It's like Star Wars in the prequels.
1039080	1040080	Yeah, yeah.
1040080	1041080	And in episode two.
1041080	1042080	Chasing in episode two.
1042080	1043080	Yeah.
1043080	1044080	Oh, God.
1044560	1047080	But here's the problem.
1047080	1049040	Spock beats the shit out of Khan.
1049040	1054320	They say, wait, you can't kill him because we got to use his blood to save Kirk's life.
1054320	1055320	And then it just cuts forward.
1055320	1059280	And then it just cuts to Kirk waking up, healed.
1059280	1060280	Khan is already apprehended.
1060280	1061280	Two weeks later.
1061280	1062280	And frozen.
1062280	1065120	And they just say, oh, here's the end of the movie.
1065120	1066120	Yeah.
1066120	1067120	They just fucking ran away.
1067120	1068120	They had no idea where to end it.
1068480	1074000	They took at least a 10, 15 minute scene completely out.
1074000	1081800	Because they didn't want to explain how apparently either they get off this transport ship or
1081800	1089560	somehow Chekov just finds them and, you know, Chekov, oh yeah, Scotty, Scotty resigns.
1089560	1091560	I didn't think that was a problem, actually.
1091560	1092560	That was a good enough question.
1092560	1095720	Actually, no, that was probably the best plot twist of the entire fucking movie.
1095720	1096720	Scotty resigning?
1096720	1099200	Scotty resigning and then going on some kind of secret agent mission.
1099200	1101200	Yeah, he has like his own adventure off of a hundred ships.
1101200	1102200	Oh, it was hilarious.
1102200	1108120	Simon Pegg is, he is astoundingly good at comedy.
1108120	1109120	I love that guy.
1109120	1110880	He's just a funny little ginger man.
1110880	1111880	Yeah, he's cool.
1111880	1112880	Yeah.
1112880	1118080	But no, yeah, that's basically the whole thing is like, it's a great ride, but it tries too
1118080	1121760	hard to be the Dark Knight set in Star Wars or Star Trek.
1121760	1124560	No, you're Zorro.
1124560	1127040	Just as I said it was going to be, that's how it was.
1127040	1131960	I could tell by the trailer, it was just trying to have that social disorder thing.
1131960	1140640	And it fucking, this light, Dave, Dave, leave it to me, leave it to me.
1140640	1142480	This lady's giving me like the weirdest look.
1142480	1148240	And now that we're opening and closing the door, okay, we're making out.
1148240	1151560	But no, it just, it was an okay movie.
1151560	1154440	If you're a Star Trek fan, you probably won't like it.
1154440	1157720	And if you think about it at all, after you leave the theater, you're not going to like
1157720	1158720	it.
1158720	1159720	That's basically what I think about it.
1159720	1164920	And like I said before, I would recommend approaching it like an average theatergoer,
1164920	1167080	treat it like a popcorn flick.
1167080	1168360	It's got the elements.
1168360	1170960	It's happening every once every minute now.
1170960	1171960	There's something fucked up.
1171960	1172960	Give it a watch.
1172960	1173960	I honestly recommend it as a popcorn movie.
1173960	1178120	I think you should wait for rental, wait for torrental.
1178120	1180120	Yeah, torrental.
1180120	1181120	Really?
1181120	1182120	Because like...
1182120	1184600	I wouldn't see this in theaters.
1184600	1185600	I would.
1185600	1188600	I don't know if I'd see it again, but seeing it once was good.
1188600	1189600	Yeah?
1189600	1190600	Yeah, it definitely was.
1190600	1192000	Well, there goes the lights on us.
1192000	1194800	Alright, we're going to go into commercial now and we're going to be back with a little
1194800	1197800	bit of trailer talk.
1197800	1203160	Okay, so, trailer talk for Star Trek.
1203160	1204160	Oops.
1204160	1205160	Four trailers.
1205160	1206520	Number one, Ender's Game.
1206520	1208440	Looks fucking amazing.
1208440	1210240	I'm a big fan of the book.
1210240	1211240	You read it?
1211240	1212240	I've read it.
1212240	1213240	I've only read it once, but I was really blown away.
1213240	1214240	I've read it.
1214240	1215240	It was good.
1215240	1216240	It was really fantastic.
1216240	1217240	I think it's going to be handling well.
1217240	1218240	If you know anything about it...
1218240	1220440	I don't recognize any of the child actors, but I do recognize the adult ones.
1220440	1221600	Yeah, it's Harrison Ford.
1221600	1222600	And Ben Kingsley.
1222600	1227440	And Ben Kingsley and that chick from Walking Dead that you're talking about.
1227440	1228440	I don't really know her.
1228440	1229440	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1229440	1231440	The girl who plays Michonne from Walking Dead.
1231440	1232440	Alright.
1232440	1236940	Anyways, if you know anything about the novel, the set looks really great.
1236940	1240940	The War Room, where they do all their little strategies...
1240940	1241940	Probably leans some more.
1241940	1246820	Yeah, the War Room, where they practice all their battles and everything, looks fantastic.
1246820	1250540	Like everything, the premise, the special effects, it all looks really enticing.
1250540	1251860	I'm really jacked for it.
1251860	1256660	That's one of the movies, that's probably one of my top three for the rest of the year,
1256660	1257660	really.
1257660	1258660	Really?
1258660	1259660	Yeah.
1259660	1260660	A Man of Steel is on there, hopefully?
1260660	1261660	Um...
1261660	1262660	I guess.
1263380	1264380	I guess.
1264380	1267380	It's a Man of Steel, Ender's Game, and what else?
1270380	1271380	Oh, the Hobbit.
1271380	1272380	No, you saw it.
1272380	1273380	No, the next one.
1273380	1274380	It's coming out already?
1274380	1276380	It's coming out in December.
1276380	1277380	Oh.
1277380	1278380	We'll have to see that.
1278380	1279380	Durr.
1279380	1281720	So the next one was the internship, and it looks like...
1281720	1282720	It looks like the...
1282720	1286580	Basically, it's the same guys that are in Wedding Crashers, of course, Vince Vaughn,
1286580	1287580	Owen Wilson.
1287580	1288580	I honestly put down...
1288580	1289580	I was writing my notes down for this.
1289580	1290580	Before the trailer.
1291500	1297580	I put Wedding Crashers 2, because these two guys apparently become redundant, and I swear
1297580	1299580	to God, it's like the same guys.
1299580	1301580	I look over at you and I'm like, is this the Wedding Crashers 2?
1301580	1302580	And you're already typing it in.
1302580	1303580	Yeah, I know.
1303580	1305860	It's like, same wavelength, of course, same actors.
1305860	1311320	Two guys, they're discovered to be redundant, they're told that everyone's working, anyone
1311320	1316340	that's anything is working in software, in IT and whatever, so they apply to Google,
1316340	1320500	they're supposed to be interns, and since they're all fucking so old...
1320500	1321500	Honestly?
1321500	1322500	Competition.
1322500	1323500	It's like...
1323500	1324500	It doesn't look good.
1324500	1325500	No, it looks terrible.
1325500	1326500	It doesn't look enticing.
1326500	1327500	No, it doesn't.
1327500	1328500	It's really stupid.
1328500	1329500	Even Wedding Crashers, I thought, looked pretty stupid.
1329500	1331500	It was good.
1331500	1332500	It was funny.
1332500	1335700	Here's the thing, they're both good actors, but you see one movie of theirs, and you've
1335700	1336700	seen every movie of theirs.
1336700	1337700	You've seen all of them.
1337700	1338700	Yeah.
1338700	1339700	I don't need to see this.
1339700	1340700	I saw Wedding Crashers, I don't need to see the internship.
1340700	1341700	That's true.
1341700	1342700	Wow.
1342700	1343700	A little Vince Vaughn's really good in Swingers.
1343700	1344700	Yeah.
1344700	1345700	I know.
1346060	1350300	The next Anchorman 2, the continuing...
1350300	1351620	The legend continues.
1351620	1352620	The legend continues.
1352620	1356820	Not as funny as the trailer for the original Anchorman, which was fucking hysterical.
1356820	1358700	I practically pissed myself.
1358700	1362060	I practically pissed myself laughing, because they just set it up so well.
1362060	1365380	Nobody knew it was coming, and then Will Ferrell...
1365380	1367060	This is back in 2005, right?
1367060	1371100	Will Ferrell was a lot less exposed, he was still exposed, but...
1371100	1372100	Probably get in.
1372100	1373100	Yeah, you're falling out.
1373500	1376620	He wasn't saturating movies the way that he did later on.
1376620	1380060	He's starting to come back, he's starting to grow back on me a bit.
1380060	1381500	I am looking forward to it.
1381500	1386740	I mean, I have seen Anchorman a bunch of times, I've seen Wake Up Ron Burgundy, which is like
1386740	1387740	the same movie.
1387740	1391420	I didn't like Anchorman, but I know people who do, and I know they're gonna like it,
1391420	1392420	so.
1392420	1393420	And last one...
1393420	1394420	World War Z.
1394420	1395420	The unfilmable movie.
1395420	1396420	World War Z.
1396420	1397420	You knew that, right?
1397420	1398420	Everyone thought that no one...
1398420	1401740	Yeah, it looks ridiculous, because there's so many zombies.
1402380	1403940	They're making ladders of themselves.
1403940	1406180	I've never read the book, I've heard really good things.
1406180	1408020	I've heard really good things about it.
1408020	1409020	I'm going to read it.
1409020	1410020	I'm going to read it.
1410020	1411820	You've read so many fucking books, you nerd.
1411820	1412980	You haven't read World War Z?
1412980	1416740	It is like the quintessential zombie book.
1416740	1420340	World War Z began our current trend in zombies.
1420340	1424980	I'm not as into zombies as you and Al are, though.
1424980	1429460	World War Z is the reason why The Walking Dead is around, or why Left 4 Dead became
1429460	1430460	a thing.
1430460	1431460	Resident Evil?
1431460	1432460	No, no.
1432460	1433460	Resident Evil was before.
1433460	1434460	Oh, okay.
1434460	1438900	Well, Resident Evil was what got me into, basically got me into zombie stuff at all.
1438900	1439900	Really?
1439900	1440900	Yeah.
1440900	1441900	But, yeah.
1441900	1442900	It looks pretty solid.
1442900	1443900	Brad Pitt.
1443900	1450740	I mean, he's generally a pretty reliable actor, and the sheer scope and magnitude of the movie
1450740	1454880	just, it does look really enticing, so I will be going on my way to read the book.
1454880	1455880	I will read it.
1455880	1457460	You can read it before or after you see it?
1457460	1458460	Before.
1458460	1459460	Before.
1459460	1460460	I've never read the books before.
1460460	1464700	Then I like to see what kind of stuff they take and leave out, whatever.
1464700	1467900	All the little asides to people that are fans and all that kind of thing.
1467900	1469900	Yeah, like they do with Game of Thrones.
1469900	1470900	They do it with Harry Potter.
1470900	1471900	They do it with Lord of the Rings.
1471900	1472900	They do it with all the...
1472900	1473900	Yeah.
1473900	1474900	There's always stuff that has to be let out.
1474900	1475900	So you want to see.
1475900	1481820	I'll always read the book before, just so I get those little tidbits of joy, of joyous
1481820	1483780	information for us fans.
1483780	1489620	Before we take off, what movie will we show next on Trailer Talk?
1489620	1491900	You want to go see Man of Steel or something?
1491900	1492900	Probably.
1492900	1493900	Yeah, next.
1493900	1494900	Okay.
1494900	1495900	Superman!
1495900	1496900	The most boring character in DC Universe.
1496900	1497900	Comic books, basically.
1497900	1498900	He's so bland.
1498900	1499900	He is the lamest superhero.
1499900	1504940	I really hope they can pull this out of their ass, like I'm really jacked.
1504940	1505940	You played Injustice, right?
1505940	1507860	No, I haven't played it yet.
1507860	1511380	In Superman, in that game, in the one dimension, he's fucking evil.
1511380	1513540	In the other dimension, he's just a lame ass.
1514300	1517220	All I can remember is something from Justice League Unlimited, where a bionic Superman
1517220	1522100	gets his head punched off, and all he goes is, thanks, and I know we're going to leave
1522100	1523100	you.
1523100	1524100	Thanks for watching Trailer Talk.
1524100	1525100	See you again.
1525100	1526100	Yeah, we'll see you for Man of Steel.
1528100	1530100	Actually, this doesn't look that bad.
1533100	1534100	Except for that.
1534100	1535100	Damn it!
