00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Welcome to Trailer Talk and we watch movies and we're actually about to go in and see

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:14,560
Star Trek Into Darkness and this time I won't be going on at length because unlike Lord

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,720
of the Rings I am not really a Star Trek fanboy.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,720
I like the shows.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,240
I'm a Star Trek fanboy.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
More than me.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,640
Definitely more than me.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,120
But yeah, watched a few of the series, if I could go back and watch Next Generation

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,120
I probably will.

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,120
It's on Netflix.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,080
But anyways, the original series, never watched that much but it seeped our culture so god

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,720
damn much that this is, it is a cultural phenomenon.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,200
How much have you heard of the movie?

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Not much other than...

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,280
You've been avoiding all the spoilers?

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,260
I've been avoiding everything about it.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,000
This is probably going up tomorrow but we're watching it on Tuesday and it came out last

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Friday.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Cheap night.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,080
Yeah, it's cheap on Tuesday so we're going on Tuesday night.

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,880
No service heading.

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:08,600
But like, I have looked up some stuff and I mean, for the longest time, up to a year

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,920
before this fucking thing was being hyped, everyone's like no no, Benedict Cumberbatch

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,280
is not Khan.

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
He's not Khan.

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,320
They have a new villain, they're not doing Wrath of Khan again, he's fucking Khan.

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,640
And I'm not saying I read a spoiler, I'm saying he's fucking Khan.

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,000
They are going to be that stupid and make him Khan.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,320
I think.

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,560
Um, I could have sworn that he was supposed to be like a...

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,760
I thought you said something like from an original series episode.

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
An original series episode.

34
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,960
It was like a psychic guy and yeah yeah.

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,400
I heard that too but I really think they're gonna...

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
You know what?

37
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
You know what?

38
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,120
He can't be any worse than Eric Bana was.

39
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm sorry but I like Eric Bana.

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,000
He's pretty decent in some movies but as, I don't even remember the fucking character's

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
name.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Nero.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Nero, right.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He was Nero.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
As Nero.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,120
I didn't really find him very believable and I really, I didn't find him very likable.

47
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
I mean.

48
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
He wasn't supposed to be likable.

49
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
He was supposed to be just massive.

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,400
I know, I know, he's like, but there's usually some kind of redeeming trait in a villain,

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,920
especially now they're making him more complex.

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,660
When The Dark Knight came out, it started this sort of trend in movies marketed towards

53
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:33,400
our generation, our demographic, where the villain had to be somebody who was hardcore,

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,360
he was a one man army, and he would destabilize social order.

55
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,760
That had to be a thing.

56
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
The Joker did it.

57
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Yeah.

58
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
They tried to...

59
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
An agent of chaos basically.

60
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,840
They tried to recreate it with Bane.

61
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,760
They tried to do it in Iron Man 3 with the Mandarin.

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
And that fucking sucked.

63
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,540
I haven't seen it yet.

64
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,940
The only Star Trek character that has that agent of chaos flavor to him is Khan.

65
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,000
This trailer, all the trailers, which were really good trailers by the way, they are

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,500
all very much a destabilizing social order type of movie.

67
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,840
So it's going to be fucking Khan.

68
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
All right.

69
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
Well.

70
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,160
We're going to figure this, Dev, you're going on it like, we're going to actually go watch

71
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
the movie.

72
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

73
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,160
We're going to actually go watch the movie.

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,560
We're going to come back later and we're going to actually discuss whether or not the shit

75
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,400
actually went down or not.

76
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,080
And hopefully I'll be putting Dev in his place because he seems to have this complete mindset

77
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,720
it's going to be a piece of shit.

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
And I think it's going to be great.

79
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
I do think it's going to be great.

80
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,400
But really, I'm going in and this time he's the hardcore, I'm the casual, I'm going in

81
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,360
thinking, okay, I'm going to go in for a great popcorn flick.

82
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,920
I'm not going to eat popcorn, but it's going to be a popcorn type flick.

83
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,960
It's just going to be guns and action and punching and fucking green aliens and whatever

84
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,860
you can say about Star Trek the original series.

85
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,480
It's going to be good.

86
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,280
That's my prediction.

87
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,680
You heard Dev, he thinks it's going to be a piece of shit or trite.

88
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,640
I think it's going to be a very poor man's dark knight set in the Star Trek universe.

89
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,000
Alright, you have our predictions.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,040
And we'll see you after the movie.

91
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,720
Oh, guess what?

92
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,800
I guarantee you, Cumberbatch is con.

93
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,360
Cumberbatch was con.

94
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,240
Cumberbatch was con.

95
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,720
Looks like I was wrong, guys.

96
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, everything I said in the start, line for line, the fucking chaos thing, the con

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,040
thing, it was, I was right, was I not?

98
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
It's true.

99
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,440
It's true.

100
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,560
He called it number two.

101
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,880
I was just kind of hoping they wouldn't be exploiting that.

102
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,600
But I don't know, I thought overall it was a great movie.

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,540
Yeah, that John Harrison name that con used as a pseudonym, that was the name of the psychic

104
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,360
guy from the fucking original series.

105
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,800
Alright, well, we got to throw back.

106
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Those assholes could have actually made a good half decent, not original, but at least

107
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,100
original in the sense that you're not going to use the obvious villain.

108
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,500
But no, it's fucking con.

109
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
It's just fucking con.

110
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Yeah.

111
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:25,340
And then they fucking, they pull scenes from Wrath of Khan word for word.

112
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,900
And they just flip things around.

113
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,140
I don't remember that much.

114
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,260
I mean, we were talking about the whole thing after the movie and I was like, you know what,

115
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,540
man, I don't really remember what the whole thing with con was other than he was like...

116
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,540
Did you watch Wrath of Khan?

117
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,540
Yes, I did.

118
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,540
Yeah?

119
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,580
It's been four years or something, or four or five years now.

120
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,860
So I don't remember it overly well.

121
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,500
All I remembered was con was like a genetically superior being and he was really pissed at

122
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,940
the Federation, or not the Federation, the Starfleet.

123
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,700
And you know, he was in exile.

124
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:04,220
Yeah, in the original, he was a addict in the 1990s, his rulers, his leadership just

125
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,020
basically failed and like him and his genetic superiors had to run away and they got frozen

126
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,020
in space.

127
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,020
Yeah, they're war criminals apparently.

128
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,020
Yeah.

129
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:18,340
And then basically what happened was that Kirk finds him 300 years later, they kind

130
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,340
of fight it out for a while in the Enterprise and then con's like...

131
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,340
Re-adactment.

132
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,100
Oh no, I'm gonna be frozen again.

133
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,580
Con is like, I'm gonna fucking go to this new planet and settle it because you know,

134
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,580
here's a good challenge for you guys.

135
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,820
Kirk's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you go off and you do that.

136
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,060
So he goes there and then between the course of the original series and then the Wrath

137
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,300
of Khan movie, something gets fucked up on the planet and it turns into a giant Tatooine

138
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,260
and then basically, con's like, fuck this shit, Kirk fucked me over, I want my revenge

139
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,220
and the entire Wrath of Khan movie is revenge.

140
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:59,380
But in this one, they started this new movie series with the intention that you wouldn't

141
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,700
have to actually be a Star Trek fan.

142
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,940
That's true.

143
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,020
And they don't explain who Khan is, they don't explain where he comes from, they don't explain

144
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,380
what his deal is, they don't even give him a motivation.

145
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,380
They...

146
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,100
Well no, that's not true.

147
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,260
He's just there to be a weaselly shit.

148
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,980
That is not entirely true.

149
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:22,340
Now he does admit that he's got, okay, spoiler alert here, there are...

150
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,660
Spoiler alert, it's Khan.

151
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,820
Yeah, no, no, no, there are these proton...

152
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,820
Photon?

153
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,820
Photon.

154
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Photon torpedoes.

155
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Photon torpedoes.

156
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,300
Yeah, I know, proton, photon, whatever, it's all sci-fi to me.

157
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,300
Just kidding, I love Star Wars.

158
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,300
Anyways.

159
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
There's all these torpedoes and in terms of...

160
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
I'm a big fan of Babylon 5 myself.

161
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,140
Oh my god, I love Babylon 5.

162
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,140
Shut up.

163
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,140
Okay, anyways.

164
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,060
They have these torpedoes, it turns out that, plot twist, that actually contains the other

165
00:07:51,060 --> 00:08:05,980
72 members of his crew and that this admiral is actually, well, yeah, he's being used.

166
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,180
He is a war criminal, he doesn't have a vendetta against Kirk, not yet.

167
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,140
This could be definitely used more.

168
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,500
Yeah, because Khan's arrived, see, he gets...

169
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,980
He gets cryogenically frozen in the end.

170
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,180
Yeah, at the end he gets frozen.

171
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,940
So there you go, he's in stasis.

172
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,820
He could text someone, someone could bring him back, somehow or another.

173
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,580
They could just keep the Khan story going.

174
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,580
But they could.

175
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,940
Okay, here's what I don't like, is that, yeah, okay, they could have had the John Harrison

176
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,340
or was it Morrison, whatever, they could have had an actual good storyline and they go,

177
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,740
nope, I'm Khan, actually, yoop-a-doop.

178
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,780
Okay, that sucks, but fine, Khan's on the scene.

179
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,780
Woo-hoo.

180
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,780
Khan to the rescue.

181
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:48,720
What I don't like is how, you know, they did the Spock sacrifices himself to save the ship

182
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
thing.

183
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Oh, they flip-flopped that.

184
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,700
But they did it with Kirk sacrificing himself to save the ship, and then down to the fucking

185
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,560
exact same lines from that scene.

186
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
It wasn't.

187
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
It was pretty fucking close.

188
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
It was close?

189
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
It changed like three words.

190
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
It was close.

191
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
I got choked up, I gotta say.

192
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,880
I did not, I was just thinking, they're fucking...

193
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,000
You don't choke up at anything.

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I was looking at this thing and I was like, they're just stealing it from that thing.

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,040
Did you get choked up by the original scene?

196
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,960
Yes, because that was fucking original.

197
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Well, yeah, it's a reboot.

198
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
That's the thing.

199
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Here's the thing.

200
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Here's the thing.

201
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,280
And then, of course, they had to add in the Khan scream at the end.

202
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
That actually, I...

203
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,760
That was fucking hilariously stupid.

204
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,760
I loved it.

205
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
Hearing Spock scream Khan.

206
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,080
I did think it was hilarious, but I thought it was actually, at least, it was lovely.

207
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:47,320
But that is such a point of contention, just because Spock, even in the conversation between

208
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,200
young Spock and old Spock, because old Spock shows up again.

209
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,880
I said, okay, there's a couple of niggles in this movie.

210
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
That's one of them.

211
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Old Spock.

212
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,320
It made sense in the first one for old Spock to show up because they're doing the time

213
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,760
reboot thing and he's like, I'm actually the Spock from the future and now the timeline's

214
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
different.

215
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
He shouldn't have been in this one.

216
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
No.

217
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
No.

218
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Overused.

219
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,720
Spock calls up old Spock and he's like, hey, how do we beat Khan in the last movie?

220
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,440
And Spock's like, well...

221
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
I really shouldn't tell you.

222
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,440
But I'm going to tell you how we did it.

223
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm going to tell you anyways.

224
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,560
And then Spock's like, okay, thanks, and then just goes and fucking puts in this planted

225
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,720
emotion that fucking destroys Khan.

226
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,400
Even the conversation, though, between them, it really showed the difference between old

227
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
Spock and the new Spock.

228
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,400
The new Spock is considerably more humanized already than old Spock, the original Spock.

229
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,160
I never found Spock or the Vulcan race in general to be non-human.

230
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,280
I just found them to be the better parts of our nature.

231
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,040
I found them to be our rational sides.

232
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,520
Spoken like a true autistic.

233
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,080
No, no, I'm serious.

234
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,840
There is something to be said about human intellect and its virtues and having a race

235
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,920
in science fiction that represents that.

236
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,160
I don't see them as mindless robots as Kirk and everyone else calls them.

237
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
I just think...

238
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
No.

239
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,080
No, no.

240
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,800
Even Spock calls them on it, though.

241
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,320
He says you're being defensive because you know I'm right.

242
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,720
That's the way it goes.

243
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,920
That's how the reactive human nature is, a human emotion.

244
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,400
You call me out on something, I'm going to come back at you.

245
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,480
It's not going to necessarily be logical, but it's going to be geared towards making

246
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,040
you feel bad about yourself.

247
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,400
But then again, Spock doesn't feel bad about himself.

248
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Not really, no.

249
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,840
He feels bad about the things that have happened.

250
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm just reminded of this fucking porn I watched.

251
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,680
It was a Star Trek porn.

252
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,920
And it was like, I think it was Jenna Hayes actually, she was like, she was sucking off

253
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,360
this Spock stand in.

254
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,600
She's like, I am this space babe who has like an extremely, I've been genetically modified

255
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,920
I have an extremely high libido and I'm going to suck off this Vulcan.

256
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,240
And she's like giving this most voracious blowjob and Spock's just standing there, he's

257
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,840
like, he like raises the eyebrows, he's like, fascinating.

258
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,920
See, that's what I'm looking for.

259
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:24,480
I'm sorry, don't get me wrong, I love the series so far, the actors, I think they've

260
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,760
been well picked, despite what Dev's dad thinks about Chris Pine, I still think he's pretty

261
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
solid.

262
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,400
Yeah, my dad doesn't like Chris Pine, but...

263
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,480
He can be a little, if you can pardon the pun, wooden at times.

264
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,000
He has a fatter neck.

265
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,080
He beefed up for this role and his neck got wider as a result, compared to the first Star

266
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
Trek.

267
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Wow, that's been four years.

268
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
Yeah, that's true.

269
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Yeah, so, a lot of changes.

270
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,280
But no, all the acting choices were fine.

271
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,880
Acting choices were fine, I thought the script...

272
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,560
Except, except for fucking Khan, again.

273
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Of course.

274
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Okay, okay.

275
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,400
Khan, he was played by a Spanish actor with dark skin, and he was supposed to be...

276
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Ricardo Montalban.

277
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
And he was supposed to be an heir.

278
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
From Fancy Island.

279
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Ah, fucking lights, hold on.

280
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,600
You have to close the door and reopen it.

281
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,840
I understand your pain, Brad.

282
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,240
Khan's character was supposed to be an Arab, and the actor was dark skinned, and he had

283
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
a Spanish accent, and everything was good.

284
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Yeah, it was...

285
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
But...

286
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Well, Moors, yeah.

287
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
But...

288
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
This guy's white.

289
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:25,080
Oh, and not just, like, kinda white, like super white, like British white, like pasty

290
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
white.

291
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
And he has a British accent.

292
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Like, Khan is supposed to be an Arab.

293
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Benedict Cumberbatch.

294
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,160
How can you get more, the only British, more British name I ever saw, other than that,

295
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,160
was Alastair T.S. Summerley.

296
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
What's that from?

297
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,280
He was one of the, like, vice, I think he was like vice dean of University of Guelph

298
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,560
or something, when my sister graduated.

299
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,880
That is the most English name I've ever seen.

300
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,560
Yeah, Cumberbatch fucking enters the movie in this helicopter shooting up a conference

301
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,160
room, just fucking sipping tea in a monocle.

302
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
Like he...

303
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,680
Not really.

304
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,320
He's a good actor, but he's miscast.

305
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
He's not Khan.

306
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,840
He didn't look like Khan, he didn't act like Khan, he didn't speak like Khan, he didn't

307
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,920
do anything that Khan would have done.

308
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
He's not Khan.

309
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,520
Yeah, musically speaking, excellent.

310
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,400
I was, like, the first movie, and most of this movie, used that same kind of musical

311
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
riff with...

312
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
You know what I'm talking about.

313
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Yeah, it's a score.

314
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,480
Yeah, but it was all kind of classically...

315
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you don't need to hum it.

316
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,080
But I like how they actually included some kind of choir for the Klingon scenes.

317
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Yeah.

318
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,240
The Klingons, they did really well.

319
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,720
The Klingons were fucking badass.

320
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
These were the first...

321
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
Except when they got killed.

322
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,000
They were the...

323
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,080
The Birds of Prey looked amazing, the Klingon, the actual makeup for the Klingons and the

324
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,720
way they were characterized looked amazing.

325
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,400
These were the best Klingons we have seen in Star Trek.

326
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
And they're all black.

327
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,640
They're supposed to be.

328
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Are they?

329
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Yeah.

330
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Klingons are...

331
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
I thought that was kind of like a...

332
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,400
Well, I know in the original series they are.

333
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
That's true.

334
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,640
Klingons are all light, like pan-skinned and really dark.

335
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,640
All of them?

336
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Yeah, all of them.

337
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
Fuck.

338
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
I thought there was a couple...

339
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,160
In the original series there, there were Klingons without the head ridges and they were a little

340
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
bit lighter.

341
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,360
And that was actually explained in an episode of, I think, Enterprise, where they go back...

342
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Are they all binos?

343
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
No, no.

344
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,080
There's a fucking disease that is made out of human DNA that infects the Klingons and

345
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,920
changes them to have a partially human genome so they don't have the ridges anymore.

346
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,640
It was basically just them trying to explain why the makeup back in the 60s sucked.

347
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,160
The music was great.

348
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
Klingons were great.

349
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,680
The CG work in these kind of movies is always going to be fucking spectacular.

350
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
Fucking fantastic.

351
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,880
Yeah, it is a spectacle of a movie and it's a great ride, but the minute you actually

352
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,400
step out of the theater and start thinking about what the fuck went on, it all just fucking

353
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
falls apart.

354
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,080
Don't approach this as a hardcore Star Trek fan.

355
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,040
Approach it as an average theatergoer.

356
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,340
Try to keep that mindset.

357
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:11,140
Take your brain, take your frontal lobe and just kind of just throw it in the garbage

358
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,760
for a couple of hours.

359
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,560
The last thing to mention would be the ending.

360
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,080
Let me set this up for you, alright?

361
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,680
Khan has failed, alright?

362
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,680
His name is Khan.

363
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,160
And his ship crashes into London and by the way...

364
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,800
It's not London, San Francisco.

365
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
It's London.

366
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
No.

367
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
It's supposed to be San Francisco.

368
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,040
In the original series, the headquarters of Starfleet was San Francisco.

369
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
In this movie, it's London.

370
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,920
They just fucked it up, but...

371
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,720
But it said San Francisco.

372
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
It said London.

373
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
What?

374
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,840
It said London on the fucking screen and it even says there was an attack in London yesterday.

375
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
It's all London.

376
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

377
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,760
The initial attack.

378
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Crashes into the city.

379
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
Okay, fine.

380
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
This...

381
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
And things explode.

382
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Starfleet.

383
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,880
And tons of people die, shit's going down and then Cumberbatch gets away by putting

384
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
on a trench coat.

385
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,320
This is the only time he actually wears the trench coat that he fucking had in the trailer.

386
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
Trench coat mafia.

387
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,640
And in the fucking... the posters and everything.

388
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,040
He puts it on in the last five minutes of the movie and he runs through the city and

389
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,520
Spock chases after him.

390
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,080
And they do this hop between flying cars and beat the shit out of each other.

391
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,080
It's like Star Wars in the prequels.

392
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,080
Yeah, yeah.

393
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,080
And in episode two.

394
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,080
Chasing in episode two.

395
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
Yeah.

396
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Oh, God.

397
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,080
But here's the problem.

398
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,040
Spock beats the shit out of Khan.

399
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,320
They say, wait, you can't kill him because we got to use his blood to save Kirk's life.

400
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,320
And then it just cuts forward.

401
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,280
And then it just cuts to Kirk waking up, healed.

402
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Khan is already apprehended.

403
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Two weeks later.

404
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
And frozen.

405
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,120
And they just say, oh, here's the end of the movie.

406
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
Yeah.

407
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
They just fucking ran away.

408
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
They had no idea where to end it.

409
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,000
They took at least a 10, 15 minute scene completely out.

410
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,800
Because they didn't want to explain how apparently either they get off this transport ship or

411
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:09,560
somehow Chekov just finds them and, you know, Chekov, oh yeah, Scotty, Scotty resigns.

412
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,560
I didn't think that was a problem, actually.

413
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
That was a good enough question.

414
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,720
Actually, no, that was probably the best plot twist of the entire fucking movie.

415
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Scotty resigning?

416
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,200
Scotty resigning and then going on some kind of secret agent mission.

417
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Yeah, he has like his own adventure off of a hundred ships.

418
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Oh, it was hilarious.

419
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,120
Simon Pegg is, he is astoundingly good at comedy.

420
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
I love that guy.

421
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,880
He's just a funny little ginger man.

422
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Yeah, he's cool.

423
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Yeah.

424
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,080
But no, yeah, that's basically the whole thing is like, it's a great ride, but it tries too

425
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,760
hard to be the Dark Knight set in Star Wars or Star Trek.

426
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,560
No, you're Zorro.

427
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,040
Just as I said it was going to be, that's how it was.

428
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,960
I could tell by the trailer, it was just trying to have that social disorder thing.

429
00:18:51,960 --> 00:19:00,640
And it fucking, this light, Dave, Dave, leave it to me, leave it to me.

430
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,480
This lady's giving me like the weirdest look.

431
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,240
And now that we're opening and closing the door, okay, we're making out.

432
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,560
But no, it just, it was an okay movie.

433
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,440
If you're a Star Trek fan, you probably won't like it.

434
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,720
And if you think about it at all, after you leave the theater, you're not going to like

435
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
it.

436
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,720
That's basically what I think about it.

437
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,920
And like I said before, I would recommend approaching it like an average theatergoer,

438
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,080
treat it like a popcorn flick.

439
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,360
It's got the elements.

440
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,960
It's happening every once every minute now.

441
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
There's something fucked up.

442
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Give it a watch.

443
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
I honestly recommend it as a popcorn movie.

444
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,120
I think you should wait for rental, wait for torrental.

445
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,120
Yeah, torrental.

446
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
Really?

447
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Because like...

448
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,600
I wouldn't see this in theaters.

449
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
I would.

450
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,600
I don't know if I'd see it again, but seeing it once was good.

451
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Yeah?

452
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Yeah, it definitely was.

453
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,000
Well, there goes the lights on us.

454
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,800
Alright, we're going to go into commercial now and we're going to be back with a little

455
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,800
bit of trailer talk.

456
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,160
Okay, so, trailer talk for Star Trek.

457
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Oops.

458
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Four trailers.

459
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,520
Number one, Ender's Game.

460
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,440
Looks fucking amazing.

461
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,240
I'm a big fan of the book.

462
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
You read it?

463
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
I've read it.

464
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,240
I've only read it once, but I was really blown away.

465
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,240
I've read it.

466
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
It was good.

467
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,240
It was really fantastic.

468
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
I think it's going to be handling well.

469
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
If you know anything about it...

470
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,440
I don't recognize any of the child actors, but I do recognize the adult ones.

471
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,600
Yeah, it's Harrison Ford.

472
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
And Ben Kingsley.

473
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,440
And Ben Kingsley and that chick from Walking Dead that you're talking about.

474
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,440
I don't really know her.

475
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,440
The girl who plays Michonne from Walking Dead.

477
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,440
Alright.

478
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,940
Anyways, if you know anything about the novel, the set looks really great.

479
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,940
The War Room, where they do all their little strategies...

480
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,940
Probably leans some more.

481
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,820
Yeah, the War Room, where they practice all their battles and everything, looks fantastic.

482
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,540
Like everything, the premise, the special effects, it all looks really enticing.

483
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,860
I'm really jacked for it.

484
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,660
That's one of the movies, that's probably one of my top three for the rest of the year,

485
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,660
really.

486
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,660
Really?

487
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,660
Yeah.

488
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
A Man of Steel is on there, hopefully?

489
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,660
Um...

490
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,660
I guess.

491
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,380
I guess.

492
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,380
It's a Man of Steel, Ender's Game, and what else?

493
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,380
Oh, the Hobbit.

494
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,380
No, you saw it.

495
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,380
No, the next one.

496
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,380
It's coming out already?

497
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,380
It's coming out in December.

498
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,380
Oh.

499
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,380
We'll have to see that.

500
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,380
Durr.

501
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,720
So the next one was the internship, and it looks like...

502
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
It looks like the...

503
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,580
Basically, it's the same guys that are in Wedding Crashers, of course, Vince Vaughn,

504
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,580
Owen Wilson.

505
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,580
I honestly put down...

506
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,580
I was writing my notes down for this.

507
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,580
Before the trailer.

508
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,580
I put Wedding Crashers 2, because these two guys apparently become redundant, and I swear

509
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,580
to God, it's like the same guys.

510
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,580
I look over at you and I'm like, is this the Wedding Crashers 2?

511
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,580
And you're already typing it in.

512
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,580
Yeah, I know.

513
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,860
It's like, same wavelength, of course, same actors.

514
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,320
Two guys, they're discovered to be redundant, they're told that everyone's working, anyone

515
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,340
that's anything is working in software, in IT and whatever, so they apply to Google,

516
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,500
they're supposed to be interns, and since they're all fucking so old...

517
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Honestly?

518
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Competition.

519
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
It's like...

520
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
It doesn't look good.

521
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,500
No, it looks terrible.

522
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
It doesn't look enticing.

523
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,500
No, it doesn't.

524
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
It's really stupid.

525
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Even Wedding Crashers, I thought, looked pretty stupid.

526
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
It was good.

527
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
It was funny.

528
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,700
Here's the thing, they're both good actors, but you see one movie of theirs, and you've

529
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,700
seen every movie of theirs.

530
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
You've seen all of them.

531
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,700
Yeah.

532
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,700
I don't need to see this.

533
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,700
I saw Wedding Crashers, I don't need to see the internship.

534
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,700
That's true.

535
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,700
Wow.

536
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,700
A little Vince Vaughn's really good in Swingers.

537
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
Yeah.

538
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,700
I know.

539
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,300
The next Anchorman 2, the continuing...

540
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,620
The legend continues.

541
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,620
The legend continues.

542
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,820
Not as funny as the trailer for the original Anchorman, which was fucking hysterical.

543
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,700
I practically pissed myself.

544
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,060
I practically pissed myself laughing, because they just set it up so well.

545
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,380
Nobody knew it was coming, and then Will Ferrell...

546
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,060
This is back in 2005, right?

547
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:51,100
Will Ferrell was a lot less exposed, he was still exposed, but...

548
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Probably get in.

549
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,100
Yeah, you're falling out.

550
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,620
He wasn't saturating movies the way that he did later on.

551
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:00,060
He's starting to come back, he's starting to grow back on me a bit.

552
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,500
I am looking forward to it.

553
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,740
I mean, I have seen Anchorman a bunch of times, I've seen Wake Up Ron Burgundy, which is like

554
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,740
the same movie.

555
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,420
I didn't like Anchorman, but I know people who do, and I know they're gonna like it,

556
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
so.

557
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,420
And last one...

558
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,420
World War Z.

559
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,420
The unfilmable movie.

560
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
World War Z.

561
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,420
You knew that, right?

562
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,420
Everyone thought that no one...

563
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,740
Yeah, it looks ridiculous, because there's so many zombies.

564
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,940
They're making ladders of themselves.

565
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,180
I've never read the book, I've heard really good things.

566
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,020
I've heard really good things about it.

567
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,020
I'm going to read it.

568
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
I'm going to read it.

569
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,820
You've read so many fucking books, you nerd.

570
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,980
You haven't read World War Z?

571
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:36,740
It is like the quintessential zombie book.

572
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,340
World War Z began our current trend in zombies.

573
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,980
I'm not as into zombies as you and Al are, though.

574
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,460
World War Z is the reason why The Walking Dead is around, or why Left 4 Dead became

575
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,460
a thing.

576
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,460
Resident Evil?

577
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,460
No, no.

578
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,460
Resident Evil was before.

579
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,460
Oh, okay.

580
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,900
Well, Resident Evil was what got me into, basically got me into zombie stuff at all.

581
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Really?

582
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,900
Yeah.

583
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,900
But, yeah.

584
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
It looks pretty solid.

585
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
Brad Pitt.

586
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:10,740
I mean, he's generally a pretty reliable actor, and the sheer scope and magnitude of the movie

587
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,880
just, it does look really enticing, so I will be going on my way to read the book.

588
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
I will read it.

589
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,460
You can read it before or after you see it?

590
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,460
Before.

591
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
Before.

592
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,460
I've never read the books before.

593
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,700
Then I like to see what kind of stuff they take and leave out, whatever.

594
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,900
All the little asides to people that are fans and all that kind of thing.

595
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,900
Yeah, like they do with Game of Thrones.

596
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,900
They do it with Harry Potter.

597
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,900
They do it with Lord of the Rings.

598
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,900
They do it with all the...

599
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
Yeah.

600
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,900
There's always stuff that has to be let out.

601
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,900
So you want to see.

602
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:41,820
I'll always read the book before, just so I get those little tidbits of joy, of joyous

603
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,780
information for us fans.

604
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:49,620
Before we take off, what movie will we show next on Trailer Talk?

605
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,900
You want to go see Man of Steel or something?

606
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
Probably.

607
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,900
Yeah, next.

608
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,900
Okay.

609
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,900
Superman!

610
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,900
The most boring character in DC Universe.

611
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
Comic books, basically.

612
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,900
He's so bland.

613
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,900
He is the lamest superhero.

614
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,940
I really hope they can pull this out of their ass, like I'm really jacked.

615
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,940
You played Injustice, right?

616
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,860
No, I haven't played it yet.

617
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,380
In Superman, in that game, in the one dimension, he's fucking evil.

618
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,540
In the other dimension, he's just a lame ass.

619
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,220
All I can remember is something from Justice League Unlimited, where a bionic Superman

620
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,100
gets his head punched off, and all he goes is, thanks, and I know we're going to leave

621
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,100
you.

622
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,100
Thanks for watching Trailer Talk.

623
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,100
See you again.

624
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Yeah, we'll see you for Man of Steel.

625
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,100
Actually, this doesn't look that bad.

626
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
Except for that.

627
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,100
Damn it!
