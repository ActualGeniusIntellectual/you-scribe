WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
Welcome to Trailer Talk and we watch movies and we're actually about to go in and see

00:05.120 --> 00:14.560
Star Trek Into Darkness and this time I won't be going on at length because unlike Lord

00:14.560 --> 00:17.720
of the Rings I am not really a Star Trek fanboy.

00:17.720 --> 00:18.720
I like the shows.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.240
I'm a Star Trek fanboy.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.240
More than me.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.640
Definitely more than me.

00:22.640 --> 00:28.120
But yeah, watched a few of the series, if I could go back and watch Next Generation

00:28.120 --> 00:29.120
I probably will.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.120
It's on Netflix.

00:30.120 --> 00:36.080
But anyways, the original series, never watched that much but it seeped our culture so god

00:36.080 --> 00:39.720
damn much that this is, it is a cultural phenomenon.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.200
How much have you heard of the movie?

00:42.200 --> 00:43.200
Not much other than...

00:43.200 --> 00:44.280
You've been avoiding all the spoilers?

00:44.280 --> 00:47.260
I've been avoiding everything about it.

00:47.260 --> 00:52.000
This is probably going up tomorrow but we're watching it on Tuesday and it came out last

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Friday.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Cheap night.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.080
Yeah, it's cheap on Tuesday so we're going on Tuesday night.

00:58.080 --> 00:59.880
No service heading.

00:59.880 --> 01:08.600
But like, I have looked up some stuff and I mean, for the longest time, up to a year

01:08.600 --> 01:13.920
before this fucking thing was being hyped, everyone's like no no, Benedict Cumberbatch

01:13.920 --> 01:15.280
is not Khan.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.280
He's not Khan.

01:16.280 --> 01:21.320
They have a new villain, they're not doing Wrath of Khan again, he's fucking Khan.

01:21.320 --> 01:25.640
And I'm not saying I read a spoiler, I'm saying he's fucking Khan.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.000
They are going to be that stupid and make him Khan.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.320
I think.

01:30.320 --> 01:34.560
Um, I could have sworn that he was supposed to be like a...

01:34.560 --> 01:39.760
I thought you said something like from an original series episode.

01:39.760 --> 01:40.760
An original series episode.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.960
It was like a psychic guy and yeah yeah.

01:42.960 --> 01:47.400
I heard that too but I really think they're gonna...

01:47.400 --> 01:48.400
You know what?

01:48.400 --> 01:49.400
You know what?

01:49.400 --> 01:51.120
He can't be any worse than Eric Bana was.

01:51.120 --> 01:54.840
I'm sorry but I like Eric Bana.

01:54.840 --> 01:59.000
He's pretty decent in some movies but as, I don't even remember the fucking character's

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
name.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Nero.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Nero, right.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
He was Nero.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
As Nero.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.120
I didn't really find him very believable and I really, I didn't find him very likable.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.120
I mean.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.120
He wasn't supposed to be likable.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.120
He was supposed to be just massive.

02:11.120 --> 02:16.400
I know, I know, he's like, but there's usually some kind of redeeming trait in a villain,

02:16.400 --> 02:19.920
especially now they're making him more complex.

02:19.920 --> 02:25.660
When The Dark Knight came out, it started this sort of trend in movies marketed towards

02:25.660 --> 02:33.400
our generation, our demographic, where the villain had to be somebody who was hardcore,

02:33.400 --> 02:38.360
he was a one man army, and he would destabilize social order.

02:38.360 --> 02:39.760
That had to be a thing.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.760
The Joker did it.

02:40.760 --> 02:41.760
Yeah.

02:41.760 --> 02:42.760
They tried to...

02:42.760 --> 02:43.760
An agent of chaos basically.

02:43.760 --> 02:44.840
They tried to recreate it with Bane.

02:44.840 --> 02:49.760
They tried to do it in Iron Man 3 with the Mandarin.

02:49.760 --> 02:50.760
And that fucking sucked.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.540
I haven't seen it yet.

02:53.540 --> 02:58.940
The only Star Trek character that has that agent of chaos flavor to him is Khan.

02:58.940 --> 03:04.000
This trailer, all the trailers, which were really good trailers by the way, they are

03:04.000 --> 03:08.500
all very much a destabilizing social order type of movie.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.840
So it's going to be fucking Khan.

03:09.840 --> 03:10.840
All right.

03:10.840 --> 03:11.840
Well.

03:11.840 --> 03:16.160
We're going to figure this, Dev, you're going on it like, we're going to actually go watch

03:16.160 --> 03:17.160
the movie.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.160
We're going to actually go watch the movie.

03:19.560 --> 03:23.560
We're going to come back later and we're going to actually discuss whether or not the shit

03:23.560 --> 03:25.400
actually went down or not.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.080
And hopefully I'll be putting Dev in his place because he seems to have this complete mindset

03:29.080 --> 03:30.720
it's going to be a piece of shit.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.720
And I think it's going to be great.

03:31.720 --> 03:32.720
I do think it's going to be great.

03:32.720 --> 03:37.400
But really, I'm going in and this time he's the hardcore, I'm the casual, I'm going in

03:37.400 --> 03:40.360
thinking, okay, I'm going to go in for a great popcorn flick.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.920
I'm not going to eat popcorn, but it's going to be a popcorn type flick.

03:43.920 --> 03:48.960
It's just going to be guns and action and punching and fucking green aliens and whatever

03:48.960 --> 03:51.860
you can say about Star Trek the original series.

03:51.860 --> 03:53.480
It's going to be good.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.280
That's my prediction.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.680
You heard Dev, he thinks it's going to be a piece of shit or trite.

03:58.680 --> 04:05.640
I think it's going to be a very poor man's dark knight set in the Star Trek universe.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.000
Alright, you have our predictions.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.040
And we'll see you after the movie.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.720
Oh, guess what?

04:11.720 --> 04:14.800
I guarantee you, Cumberbatch is con.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.360
Cumberbatch was con.

04:18.360 --> 04:22.240
Cumberbatch was con.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.720
Looks like I was wrong, guys.

04:23.720 --> 04:32.000
Yeah, everything I said in the start, line for line, the fucking chaos thing, the con

04:32.000 --> 04:36.040
thing, it was, I was right, was I not?

04:36.040 --> 04:37.040
It's true.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.440
It's true.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.560
He called it number two.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.880
I was just kind of hoping they wouldn't be exploiting that.

04:42.880 --> 04:47.600
But I don't know, I thought overall it was a great movie.

04:47.600 --> 04:53.540
Yeah, that John Harrison name that con used as a pseudonym, that was the name of the psychic

04:53.540 --> 04:56.360
guy from the fucking original series.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.800
Alright, well, we got to throw back.

04:59.800 --> 05:05.800
Those assholes could have actually made a good half decent, not original, but at least

05:05.800 --> 05:10.100
original in the sense that you're not going to use the obvious villain.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.500
But no, it's fucking con.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.500
It's just fucking con.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.500
Yeah.

05:15.500 --> 05:25.340
And then they fucking, they pull scenes from Wrath of Khan word for word.

05:25.340 --> 05:26.900
And they just flip things around.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.140
I don't remember that much.

05:28.140 --> 05:32.260
I mean, we were talking about the whole thing after the movie and I was like, you know what,

05:32.260 --> 05:35.540
man, I don't really remember what the whole thing with con was other than he was like...

05:35.540 --> 05:36.540
Did you watch Wrath of Khan?

05:36.540 --> 05:37.540
Yes, I did.

05:37.540 --> 05:38.540
Yeah?

05:38.540 --> 05:40.580
It's been four years or something, or four or five years now.

05:40.580 --> 05:42.860
So I don't remember it overly well.

05:42.860 --> 05:48.500
All I remembered was con was like a genetically superior being and he was really pissed at

05:48.500 --> 05:51.940
the Federation, or not the Federation, the Starfleet.

05:51.940 --> 05:56.700
And you know, he was in exile.

05:56.700 --> 06:04.220
Yeah, in the original, he was a addict in the 1990s, his rulers, his leadership just

06:04.220 --> 06:08.020
basically failed and like him and his genetic superiors had to run away and they got frozen

06:08.020 --> 06:09.020
in space.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.020
Yeah, they're war criminals apparently.

06:11.020 --> 06:12.020
Yeah.

06:12.020 --> 06:18.340
And then basically what happened was that Kirk finds him 300 years later, they kind

06:18.340 --> 06:21.340
of fight it out for a while in the Enterprise and then con's like...

06:21.340 --> 06:22.340
Re-adactment.

06:22.340 --> 06:27.100
Oh no, I'm gonna be frozen again.

06:27.100 --> 06:31.580
Con is like, I'm gonna fucking go to this new planet and settle it because you know,

06:31.580 --> 06:32.580
here's a good challenge for you guys.

06:32.580 --> 06:34.820
Kirk's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, you go off and you do that.

06:34.820 --> 06:40.060
So he goes there and then between the course of the original series and then the Wrath

06:40.060 --> 06:45.300
of Khan movie, something gets fucked up on the planet and it turns into a giant Tatooine

06:45.300 --> 06:50.260
and then basically, con's like, fuck this shit, Kirk fucked me over, I want my revenge

06:50.260 --> 06:52.220
and the entire Wrath of Khan movie is revenge.

06:52.220 --> 06:59.380
But in this one, they started this new movie series with the intention that you wouldn't

06:59.380 --> 07:01.700
have to actually be a Star Trek fan.

07:01.700 --> 07:02.940
That's true.

07:02.940 --> 07:06.020
And they don't explain who Khan is, they don't explain where he comes from, they don't explain

07:06.020 --> 07:09.380
what his deal is, they don't even give him a motivation.

07:09.380 --> 07:10.380
They...

07:10.380 --> 07:12.100
Well no, that's not true.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.260
He's just there to be a weaselly shit.

07:14.260 --> 07:15.980
That is not entirely true.

07:15.980 --> 07:22.340
Now he does admit that he's got, okay, spoiler alert here, there are...

07:22.340 --> 07:23.660
Spoiler alert, it's Khan.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.820
Yeah, no, no, no, there are these proton...

07:26.820 --> 07:27.820
Photon?

07:27.820 --> 07:28.820
Photon.

07:28.820 --> 07:29.820
Photon torpedoes.

07:29.820 --> 07:30.820
Photon torpedoes.

07:30.820 --> 07:35.300
Yeah, I know, proton, photon, whatever, it's all sci-fi to me.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.300
Just kidding, I love Star Wars.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.300
Anyways.

07:38.300 --> 07:40.300
There's all these torpedoes and in terms of...

07:40.300 --> 07:42.300
I'm a big fan of Babylon 5 myself.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.140
Oh my god, I love Babylon 5.

07:44.140 --> 07:45.140
Shut up.

07:45.140 --> 07:46.140
Okay, anyways.

07:46.140 --> 07:51.060
They have these torpedoes, it turns out that, plot twist, that actually contains the other

07:51.060 --> 08:05.980
72 members of his crew and that this admiral is actually, well, yeah, he's being used.

08:05.980 --> 08:10.180
He is a war criminal, he doesn't have a vendetta against Kirk, not yet.

08:10.180 --> 08:12.140
This could be definitely used more.

08:12.140 --> 08:14.500
Yeah, because Khan's arrived, see, he gets...

08:14.500 --> 08:15.980
He gets cryogenically frozen in the end.

08:15.980 --> 08:17.180
Yeah, at the end he gets frozen.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.940
So there you go, he's in stasis.

08:18.940 --> 08:21.820
He could text someone, someone could bring him back, somehow or another.

08:21.820 --> 08:23.580
They could just keep the Khan story going.

08:23.580 --> 08:24.580
But they could.

08:24.580 --> 08:29.940
Okay, here's what I don't like, is that, yeah, okay, they could have had the John Harrison

08:29.940 --> 08:34.340
or was it Morrison, whatever, they could have had an actual good storyline and they go,

08:34.340 --> 08:36.740
nope, I'm Khan, actually, yoop-a-doop.

08:36.740 --> 08:39.780
Okay, that sucks, but fine, Khan's on the scene.

08:39.780 --> 08:40.780
Woo-hoo.

08:40.780 --> 08:41.780
Khan to the rescue.

08:41.780 --> 08:48.720
What I don't like is how, you know, they did the Spock sacrifices himself to save the ship

08:48.720 --> 08:49.720
thing.

08:49.720 --> 08:50.720
Oh, they flip-flopped that.

08:50.720 --> 08:57.700
But they did it with Kirk sacrificing himself to save the ship, and then down to the fucking

08:57.700 --> 09:00.560
exact same lines from that scene.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.560
It wasn't.

09:01.560 --> 09:02.560
It was pretty fucking close.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.560
It was close?

09:03.560 --> 09:04.560
It changed like three words.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.560
It was close.

09:05.560 --> 09:06.560
I got choked up, I gotta say.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.880
I did not, I was just thinking, they're fucking...

09:08.880 --> 09:10.000
You don't choke up at anything.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
I was looking at this thing and I was like, they're just stealing it from that thing.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.040
Did you get choked up by the original scene?

09:16.040 --> 09:17.960
Yes, because that was fucking original.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.200
Well, yeah, it's a reboot.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.200
That's the thing.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.200
Here's the thing.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.200
Here's the thing.

09:24.200 --> 09:28.280
And then, of course, they had to add in the Khan scream at the end.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.280
That actually, I...

09:29.280 --> 09:32.760
That was fucking hilariously stupid.

09:32.760 --> 09:33.760
I loved it.

09:33.760 --> 09:34.760
Hearing Spock scream Khan.

09:34.760 --> 09:40.080
I did think it was hilarious, but I thought it was actually, at least, it was lovely.

09:40.080 --> 09:47.320
But that is such a point of contention, just because Spock, even in the conversation between

09:47.360 --> 09:52.200
young Spock and old Spock, because old Spock shows up again.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.880
I said, okay, there's a couple of niggles in this movie.

09:54.880 --> 09:55.880
That's one of them.

09:55.880 --> 09:56.880
Old Spock.

09:56.880 --> 10:01.320
It made sense in the first one for old Spock to show up because they're doing the time

10:01.320 --> 10:04.760
reboot thing and he's like, I'm actually the Spock from the future and now the timeline's

10:04.760 --> 10:05.760
different.

10:05.760 --> 10:06.760
He shouldn't have been in this one.

10:06.760 --> 10:07.760
No.

10:07.760 --> 10:08.760
No.

10:08.760 --> 10:09.760
Overused.

10:09.760 --> 10:13.720
Spock calls up old Spock and he's like, hey, how do we beat Khan in the last movie?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.440
And Spock's like, well...

10:15.440 --> 10:17.120
I really shouldn't tell you.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.440
But I'm going to tell you how we did it.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.200
I'm going to tell you anyways.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.560
And then Spock's like, okay, thanks, and then just goes and fucking puts in this planted

10:24.560 --> 10:27.720
emotion that fucking destroys Khan.

10:27.720 --> 10:31.400
Even the conversation, though, between them, it really showed the difference between old

10:31.400 --> 10:33.600
Spock and the new Spock.

10:33.600 --> 10:40.400
The new Spock is considerably more humanized already than old Spock, the original Spock.

10:40.400 --> 10:45.160
I never found Spock or the Vulcan race in general to be non-human.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.280
I just found them to be the better parts of our nature.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.040
I found them to be our rational sides.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.520
Spoken like a true autistic.

10:52.520 --> 10:56.080
No, no, I'm serious.

10:56.080 --> 11:01.840
There is something to be said about human intellect and its virtues and having a race

11:01.840 --> 11:03.920
in science fiction that represents that.

11:03.920 --> 11:08.160
I don't see them as mindless robots as Kirk and everyone else calls them.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.160
I just think...

11:09.160 --> 11:10.160
No.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.080
No, no.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.800
Even Spock calls them on it, though.

11:14.840 --> 11:19.320
He says you're being defensive because you know I'm right.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.720
That's the way it goes.

11:21.720 --> 11:25.920
That's how the reactive human nature is, a human emotion.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.400
You call me out on something, I'm going to come back at you.

11:28.400 --> 11:33.480
It's not going to necessarily be logical, but it's going to be geared towards making

11:33.480 --> 11:36.040
you feel bad about yourself.

11:36.040 --> 11:40.400
But then again, Spock doesn't feel bad about himself.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.400
Not really, no.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.840
He feels bad about the things that have happened.

11:42.880 --> 11:46.080
I'm just reminded of this fucking porn I watched.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.680
It was a Star Trek porn.

11:47.680 --> 11:53.920
And it was like, I think it was Jenna Hayes actually, she was like, she was sucking off

11:53.920 --> 11:55.360
this Spock stand in.

11:55.360 --> 11:59.600
She's like, I am this space babe who has like an extremely, I've been genetically modified

11:59.600 --> 12:02.920
I have an extremely high libido and I'm going to suck off this Vulcan.

12:02.920 --> 12:06.240
And she's like giving this most voracious blowjob and Spock's just standing there, he's

12:06.240 --> 12:09.840
like, he like raises the eyebrows, he's like, fascinating.

12:09.840 --> 12:13.920
See, that's what I'm looking for.

12:13.920 --> 12:24.480
I'm sorry, don't get me wrong, I love the series so far, the actors, I think they've

12:24.480 --> 12:28.760
been well picked, despite what Dev's dad thinks about Chris Pine, I still think he's pretty

12:28.760 --> 12:29.760
solid.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.400
Yeah, my dad doesn't like Chris Pine, but...

12:31.400 --> 12:34.480
He can be a little, if you can pardon the pun, wooden at times.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.000
He has a fatter neck.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.080
He beefed up for this role and his neck got wider as a result, compared to the first Star

12:42.080 --> 12:43.080
Trek.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.080
Wow, that's been four years.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.080
Yeah, that's true.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.080
Yeah, so, a lot of changes.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.280
But no, all the acting choices were fine.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.880
Acting choices were fine, I thought the script...

12:49.880 --> 12:52.560
Except, except for fucking Khan, again.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.560
Of course.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.560
Okay, okay.

12:54.560 --> 12:58.400
Khan, he was played by a Spanish actor with dark skin, and he was supposed to be...

12:58.400 --> 12:59.400
Ricardo Montalban.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.400
And he was supposed to be an heir.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.400
From Fancy Island.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.400
Ah, fucking lights, hold on.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.600
You have to close the door and reopen it.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.840
I understand your pain, Brad.

13:07.880 --> 13:12.240
Khan's character was supposed to be an Arab, and the actor was dark skinned, and he had

13:12.240 --> 13:14.240
a Spanish accent, and everything was good.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.240
Yeah, it was...

13:15.240 --> 13:16.240
But...

13:16.240 --> 13:17.240
Well, Moors, yeah.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.240
But...

13:18.240 --> 13:19.240
This guy's white.

13:19.240 --> 13:25.080
Oh, and not just, like, kinda white, like super white, like British white, like pasty

13:25.080 --> 13:26.080
white.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.080
And he has a British accent.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.080
Like, Khan is supposed to be an Arab.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.080
Benedict Cumberbatch.

13:30.080 --> 13:35.160
How can you get more, the only British, more British name I ever saw, other than that,

13:35.160 --> 13:38.160
was Alastair T.S. Summerley.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.160
What's that from?

13:39.160 --> 13:43.280
He was one of the, like, vice, I think he was like vice dean of University of Guelph

13:43.280 --> 13:46.560
or something, when my sister graduated.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.880
That is the most English name I've ever seen.

13:48.880 --> 13:53.560
Yeah, Cumberbatch fucking enters the movie in this helicopter shooting up a conference

13:53.560 --> 13:56.160
room, just fucking sipping tea in a monocle.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.160
Like he...

13:57.160 --> 14:00.680
Not really.

14:00.680 --> 14:04.320
He's a good actor, but he's miscast.

14:04.320 --> 14:05.320
He's not Khan.

14:05.320 --> 14:08.840
He didn't look like Khan, he didn't act like Khan, he didn't speak like Khan, he didn't

14:08.840 --> 14:10.920
do anything that Khan would have done.

14:10.920 --> 14:11.920
He's not Khan.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.520
Yeah, musically speaking, excellent.

14:13.520 --> 14:19.400
I was, like, the first movie, and most of this movie, used that same kind of musical

14:19.400 --> 14:20.400
riff with...

14:20.400 --> 14:21.400
You know what I'm talking about.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.400
Yeah, it's a score.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.480
Yeah, but it was all kind of classically...

14:24.480 --> 14:28.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you don't need to hum it.

14:28.240 --> 14:33.080
But I like how they actually included some kind of choir for the Klingon scenes.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.080
Yeah.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.240
The Klingons, they did really well.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.720
The Klingons were fucking badass.

14:39.720 --> 14:40.720
These were the first...

14:40.720 --> 14:42.720
Except when they got killed.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.000
They were the...

14:44.000 --> 14:49.080
The Birds of Prey looked amazing, the Klingon, the actual makeup for the Klingons and the

14:49.080 --> 14:51.720
way they were characterized looked amazing.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.400
These were the best Klingons we have seen in Star Trek.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.400
And they're all black.

14:55.400 --> 14:56.640
They're supposed to be.

14:56.640 --> 14:57.640
Are they?

14:57.640 --> 14:58.640
Yeah.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.640
Klingons are...

14:59.640 --> 15:00.640
I thought that was kind of like a...

15:00.640 --> 15:03.400
Well, I know in the original series they are.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.400
That's true.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.640
Klingons are all light, like pan-skinned and really dark.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.640
All of them?

15:08.640 --> 15:09.640
Yeah, all of them.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.640
Fuck.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.640
I thought there was a couple...

15:11.640 --> 15:14.160
In the original series there, there were Klingons without the head ridges and they were a little

15:14.160 --> 15:15.160
bit lighter.

15:15.160 --> 15:21.360
And that was actually explained in an episode of, I think, Enterprise, where they go back...

15:21.360 --> 15:22.360
Are they all binos?

15:22.360 --> 15:23.360
No, no.

15:23.360 --> 15:29.080
There's a fucking disease that is made out of human DNA that infects the Klingons and

15:29.080 --> 15:32.920
changes them to have a partially human genome so they don't have the ridges anymore.

15:32.920 --> 15:37.640
It was basically just them trying to explain why the makeup back in the 60s sucked.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.160
The music was great.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.160
Klingons were great.

15:40.160 --> 15:43.680
The CG work in these kind of movies is always going to be fucking spectacular.

15:43.680 --> 15:44.680
Fucking fantastic.

15:44.680 --> 15:50.880
Yeah, it is a spectacle of a movie and it's a great ride, but the minute you actually

15:50.880 --> 15:55.400
step out of the theater and start thinking about what the fuck went on, it all just fucking

15:55.400 --> 15:56.400
falls apart.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.080
Don't approach this as a hardcore Star Trek fan.

15:59.080 --> 16:03.040
Approach it as an average theatergoer.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.340
Try to keep that mindset.

16:05.340 --> 16:11.140
Take your brain, take your frontal lobe and just kind of just throw it in the garbage

16:11.140 --> 16:14.760
for a couple of hours.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.560
The last thing to mention would be the ending.

16:16.560 --> 16:22.080
Let me set this up for you, alright?

16:22.080 --> 16:24.680
Khan has failed, alright?

16:24.680 --> 16:25.680
His name is Khan.

16:25.680 --> 16:29.160
And his ship crashes into London and by the way...

16:29.160 --> 16:30.800
It's not London, San Francisco.

16:30.800 --> 16:31.800
It's London.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.800
No.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.800
It's supposed to be San Francisco.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.040
In the original series, the headquarters of Starfleet was San Francisco.

16:37.040 --> 16:38.040
In this movie, it's London.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.920
They just fucked it up, but...

16:39.920 --> 16:41.720
But it said San Francisco.

16:41.720 --> 16:42.720
It said London.

16:42.720 --> 16:43.720
What?

16:43.720 --> 16:46.840
It said London on the fucking screen and it even says there was an attack in London yesterday.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.840
It's all London.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.840
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.760
The initial attack.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.760
Crashes into the city.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.760
Okay, fine.

16:52.760 --> 16:53.760
This...

16:53.760 --> 16:54.760
And things explode.

16:54.840 --> 16:55.840
Starfleet.

16:55.840 --> 17:00.880
And tons of people die, shit's going down and then Cumberbatch gets away by putting

17:00.880 --> 17:01.880
on a trench coat.

17:01.880 --> 17:05.320
This is the only time he actually wears the trench coat that he fucking had in the trailer.

17:05.320 --> 17:06.320
Trench coat mafia.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.640
And in the fucking... the posters and everything.

17:08.640 --> 17:11.040
He puts it on in the last five minutes of the movie and he runs through the city and

17:11.040 --> 17:12.520
Spock chases after him.

17:12.520 --> 17:16.080
And they do this hop between flying cars and beat the shit out of each other.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.080
It's like Star Wars in the prequels.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.080
Yeah, yeah.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.080
And in episode two.

17:21.080 --> 17:22.080
Chasing in episode two.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.080
Yeah.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.080
Oh, God.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.080
But here's the problem.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.040
Spock beats the shit out of Khan.

17:29.040 --> 17:34.320
They say, wait, you can't kill him because we got to use his blood to save Kirk's life.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.320
And then it just cuts forward.

17:35.320 --> 17:39.280
And then it just cuts to Kirk waking up, healed.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.280
Khan is already apprehended.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.280
Two weeks later.

17:41.280 --> 17:42.280
And frozen.

17:42.280 --> 17:45.120
And they just say, oh, here's the end of the movie.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.120
Yeah.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.120
They just fucking ran away.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.120
They had no idea where to end it.

17:48.480 --> 17:54.000
They took at least a 10, 15 minute scene completely out.

17:54.000 --> 18:01.800
Because they didn't want to explain how apparently either they get off this transport ship or

18:01.800 --> 18:09.560
somehow Chekov just finds them and, you know, Chekov, oh yeah, Scotty, Scotty resigns.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.560
I didn't think that was a problem, actually.

18:11.560 --> 18:12.560
That was a good enough question.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.720
Actually, no, that was probably the best plot twist of the entire fucking movie.

18:15.720 --> 18:16.720
Scotty resigning?

18:16.720 --> 18:19.200
Scotty resigning and then going on some kind of secret agent mission.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.200
Yeah, he has like his own adventure off of a hundred ships.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.200
Oh, it was hilarious.

18:22.200 --> 18:28.120
Simon Pegg is, he is astoundingly good at comedy.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.120
I love that guy.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.880
He's just a funny little ginger man.

18:30.880 --> 18:31.880
Yeah, he's cool.

18:31.880 --> 18:32.880
Yeah.

18:32.880 --> 18:38.080
But no, yeah, that's basically the whole thing is like, it's a great ride, but it tries too

18:38.080 --> 18:41.760
hard to be the Dark Knight set in Star Wars or Star Trek.

18:41.760 --> 18:44.560
No, you're Zorro.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.040
Just as I said it was going to be, that's how it was.

18:47.040 --> 18:51.960
I could tell by the trailer, it was just trying to have that social disorder thing.

18:51.960 --> 19:00.640
And it fucking, this light, Dave, Dave, leave it to me, leave it to me.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.480
This lady's giving me like the weirdest look.

19:02.480 --> 19:08.240
And now that we're opening and closing the door, okay, we're making out.

19:08.240 --> 19:11.560
But no, it just, it was an okay movie.

19:11.560 --> 19:14.440
If you're a Star Trek fan, you probably won't like it.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.720
And if you think about it at all, after you leave the theater, you're not going to like

19:17.720 --> 19:18.720
it.

19:18.720 --> 19:19.720
That's basically what I think about it.

19:19.720 --> 19:24.920
And like I said before, I would recommend approaching it like an average theatergoer,

19:24.920 --> 19:27.080
treat it like a popcorn flick.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.360
It's got the elements.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.960
It's happening every once every minute now.

19:30.960 --> 19:31.960
There's something fucked up.

19:31.960 --> 19:32.960
Give it a watch.

19:32.960 --> 19:33.960
I honestly recommend it as a popcorn movie.

19:33.960 --> 19:38.120
I think you should wait for rental, wait for torrental.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.120
Yeah, torrental.

19:40.120 --> 19:41.120
Really?

19:41.120 --> 19:42.120
Because like...

19:42.120 --> 19:44.600
I wouldn't see this in theaters.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.600
I would.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.600
I don't know if I'd see it again, but seeing it once was good.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.600
Yeah?

19:49.600 --> 19:50.600
Yeah, it definitely was.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.000
Well, there goes the lights on us.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.800
Alright, we're going to go into commercial now and we're going to be back with a little

19:54.800 --> 19:57.800
bit of trailer talk.

19:57.800 --> 20:03.160
Okay, so, trailer talk for Star Trek.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.160
Oops.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.160
Four trailers.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.520
Number one, Ender's Game.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.440
Looks fucking amazing.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.240
I'm a big fan of the book.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.240
You read it?

20:11.240 --> 20:12.240
I've read it.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.240
I've only read it once, but I was really blown away.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.240
I've read it.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.240
It was good.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.240
It was really fantastic.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.240
I think it's going to be handling well.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.240
If you know anything about it...

20:18.240 --> 20:20.440
I don't recognize any of the child actors, but I do recognize the adult ones.

20:20.440 --> 20:21.600
Yeah, it's Harrison Ford.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.600
And Ben Kingsley.

20:22.600 --> 20:27.440
And Ben Kingsley and that chick from Walking Dead that you're talking about.

20:27.440 --> 20:28.440
I don't really know her.

20:28.440 --> 20:29.440
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.440
The girl who plays Michonne from Walking Dead.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.440
Alright.

20:32.440 --> 20:36.940
Anyways, if you know anything about the novel, the set looks really great.

20:36.940 --> 20:40.940
The War Room, where they do all their little strategies...

20:40.940 --> 20:41.940
Probably leans some more.

20:41.940 --> 20:46.820
Yeah, the War Room, where they practice all their battles and everything, looks fantastic.

20:46.820 --> 20:50.540
Like everything, the premise, the special effects, it all looks really enticing.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.860
I'm really jacked for it.

20:51.860 --> 20:56.660
That's one of the movies, that's probably one of my top three for the rest of the year,

20:56.660 --> 20:57.660
really.

20:57.660 --> 20:58.660
Really?

20:58.660 --> 20:59.660
Yeah.

20:59.660 --> 21:00.660
A Man of Steel is on there, hopefully?

21:00.660 --> 21:01.660
Um...

21:01.660 --> 21:02.660
I guess.

21:03.380 --> 21:04.380
I guess.

21:04.380 --> 21:07.380
It's a Man of Steel, Ender's Game, and what else?

21:10.380 --> 21:11.380
Oh, the Hobbit.

21:11.380 --> 21:12.380
No, you saw it.

21:12.380 --> 21:13.380
No, the next one.

21:13.380 --> 21:14.380
It's coming out already?

21:14.380 --> 21:16.380
It's coming out in December.

21:16.380 --> 21:17.380
Oh.

21:17.380 --> 21:18.380
We'll have to see that.

21:18.380 --> 21:19.380
Durr.

21:19.380 --> 21:21.720
So the next one was the internship, and it looks like...

21:21.720 --> 21:22.720
It looks like the...

21:22.720 --> 21:26.580
Basically, it's the same guys that are in Wedding Crashers, of course, Vince Vaughn,

21:26.580 --> 21:27.580
Owen Wilson.

21:27.580 --> 21:28.580
I honestly put down...

21:28.580 --> 21:29.580
I was writing my notes down for this.

21:29.580 --> 21:30.580
Before the trailer.

21:31.500 --> 21:37.580
I put Wedding Crashers 2, because these two guys apparently become redundant, and I swear

21:37.580 --> 21:39.580
to God, it's like the same guys.

21:39.580 --> 21:41.580
I look over at you and I'm like, is this the Wedding Crashers 2?

21:41.580 --> 21:42.580
And you're already typing it in.

21:42.580 --> 21:43.580
Yeah, I know.

21:43.580 --> 21:45.860
It's like, same wavelength, of course, same actors.

21:45.860 --> 21:51.320
Two guys, they're discovered to be redundant, they're told that everyone's working, anyone

21:51.320 --> 21:56.340
that's anything is working in software, in IT and whatever, so they apply to Google,

21:56.340 --> 22:00.500
they're supposed to be interns, and since they're all fucking so old...

22:00.500 --> 22:01.500
Honestly?

22:01.500 --> 22:02.500
Competition.

22:02.500 --> 22:03.500
It's like...

22:03.500 --> 22:04.500
It doesn't look good.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.500
No, it looks terrible.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.500
It doesn't look enticing.

22:06.500 --> 22:07.500
No, it doesn't.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.500
It's really stupid.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.500
Even Wedding Crashers, I thought, looked pretty stupid.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.500
It was good.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.500
It was funny.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.700
Here's the thing, they're both good actors, but you see one movie of theirs, and you've

22:15.700 --> 22:16.700
seen every movie of theirs.

22:16.700 --> 22:17.700
You've seen all of them.

22:17.700 --> 22:18.700
Yeah.

22:18.700 --> 22:19.700
I don't need to see this.

22:19.700 --> 22:20.700
I saw Wedding Crashers, I don't need to see the internship.

22:20.700 --> 22:21.700
That's true.

22:21.700 --> 22:22.700
Wow.

22:22.700 --> 22:23.700
A little Vince Vaughn's really good in Swingers.

22:23.700 --> 22:24.700
Yeah.

22:24.700 --> 22:25.700
I know.

22:26.060 --> 22:30.300
The next Anchorman 2, the continuing...

22:30.300 --> 22:31.620
The legend continues.

22:31.620 --> 22:32.620
The legend continues.

22:32.620 --> 22:36.820
Not as funny as the trailer for the original Anchorman, which was fucking hysterical.

22:36.820 --> 22:38.700
I practically pissed myself.

22:38.700 --> 22:42.060
I practically pissed myself laughing, because they just set it up so well.

22:42.060 --> 22:45.380
Nobody knew it was coming, and then Will Ferrell...

22:45.380 --> 22:47.060
This is back in 2005, right?

22:47.060 --> 22:51.100
Will Ferrell was a lot less exposed, he was still exposed, but...

22:51.100 --> 22:52.100
Probably get in.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.100
Yeah, you're falling out.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.620
He wasn't saturating movies the way that he did later on.

22:56.620 --> 23:00.060
He's starting to come back, he's starting to grow back on me a bit.

23:00.060 --> 23:01.500
I am looking forward to it.

23:01.500 --> 23:06.740
I mean, I have seen Anchorman a bunch of times, I've seen Wake Up Ron Burgundy, which is like

23:06.740 --> 23:07.740
the same movie.

23:07.740 --> 23:11.420
I didn't like Anchorman, but I know people who do, and I know they're gonna like it,

23:11.420 --> 23:12.420
so.

23:12.420 --> 23:13.420
And last one...

23:13.420 --> 23:14.420
World War Z.

23:14.420 --> 23:15.420
The unfilmable movie.

23:15.420 --> 23:16.420
World War Z.

23:16.420 --> 23:17.420
You knew that, right?

23:17.420 --> 23:18.420
Everyone thought that no one...

23:18.420 --> 23:21.740
Yeah, it looks ridiculous, because there's so many zombies.

23:22.380 --> 23:23.940
They're making ladders of themselves.

23:23.940 --> 23:26.180
I've never read the book, I've heard really good things.

23:26.180 --> 23:28.020
I've heard really good things about it.

23:28.020 --> 23:29.020
I'm going to read it.

23:29.020 --> 23:30.020
I'm going to read it.

23:30.020 --> 23:31.820
You've read so many fucking books, you nerd.

23:31.820 --> 23:32.980
You haven't read World War Z?

23:32.980 --> 23:36.740
It is like the quintessential zombie book.

23:36.740 --> 23:40.340
World War Z began our current trend in zombies.

23:40.340 --> 23:44.980
I'm not as into zombies as you and Al are, though.

23:44.980 --> 23:49.460
World War Z is the reason why The Walking Dead is around, or why Left 4 Dead became

23:49.460 --> 23:50.460
a thing.

23:50.460 --> 23:51.460
Resident Evil?

23:51.460 --> 23:52.460
No, no.

23:52.460 --> 23:53.460
Resident Evil was before.

23:53.460 --> 23:54.460
Oh, okay.

23:54.460 --> 23:58.900
Well, Resident Evil was what got me into, basically got me into zombie stuff at all.

23:58.900 --> 23:59.900
Really?

23:59.900 --> 24:00.900
Yeah.

24:00.900 --> 24:01.900
But, yeah.

24:01.900 --> 24:02.900
It looks pretty solid.

24:02.900 --> 24:03.900
Brad Pitt.

24:03.900 --> 24:10.740
I mean, he's generally a pretty reliable actor, and the sheer scope and magnitude of the movie

24:10.740 --> 24:14.880
just, it does look really enticing, so I will be going on my way to read the book.

24:14.880 --> 24:15.880
I will read it.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.460
You can read it before or after you see it?

24:17.460 --> 24:18.460
Before.

24:18.460 --> 24:19.460
Before.

24:19.460 --> 24:20.460
I've never read the books before.

24:20.460 --> 24:24.700
Then I like to see what kind of stuff they take and leave out, whatever.

24:24.700 --> 24:27.900
All the little asides to people that are fans and all that kind of thing.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.900
Yeah, like they do with Game of Thrones.

24:29.900 --> 24:30.900
They do it with Harry Potter.

24:30.900 --> 24:31.900
They do it with Lord of the Rings.

24:31.900 --> 24:32.900
They do it with all the...

24:32.900 --> 24:33.900
Yeah.

24:33.900 --> 24:34.900
There's always stuff that has to be let out.

24:34.900 --> 24:35.900
So you want to see.

24:35.900 --> 24:41.820
I'll always read the book before, just so I get those little tidbits of joy, of joyous

24:41.820 --> 24:43.780
information for us fans.

24:43.780 --> 24:49.620
Before we take off, what movie will we show next on Trailer Talk?

24:49.620 --> 24:51.900
You want to go see Man of Steel or something?

24:51.900 --> 24:52.900
Probably.

24:52.900 --> 24:53.900
Yeah, next.

24:53.900 --> 24:54.900
Okay.

24:54.900 --> 24:55.900
Superman!

24:55.900 --> 24:56.900
The most boring character in DC Universe.

24:56.900 --> 24:57.900
Comic books, basically.

24:57.900 --> 24:58.900
He's so bland.

24:58.900 --> 24:59.900
He is the lamest superhero.

24:59.900 --> 25:04.940
I really hope they can pull this out of their ass, like I'm really jacked.

25:04.940 --> 25:05.940
You played Injustice, right?

25:05.940 --> 25:07.860
No, I haven't played it yet.

25:07.860 --> 25:11.380
In Superman, in that game, in the one dimension, he's fucking evil.

25:11.380 --> 25:13.540
In the other dimension, he's just a lame ass.

25:14.300 --> 25:17.220
All I can remember is something from Justice League Unlimited, where a bionic Superman

25:17.220 --> 25:22.100
gets his head punched off, and all he goes is, thanks, and I know we're going to leave

25:22.100 --> 25:23.100
you.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.100
Thanks for watching Trailer Talk.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.100
See you again.

25:25.100 --> 25:26.100
Yeah, we'll see you for Man of Steel.

25:28.100 --> 25:30.100
Actually, this doesn't look that bad.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.100
Except for that.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.100
Damn it!
