0	2600	My roommate Dave's got this poster stuck to his wall.
2600	4200	It's kind of funny, it says,
4200	9000	Welcome to the Party with various communist historical figures wearing party hats and partying.
9000	10900	I can see why somebody would get a kick out of it.
10900	12900	And I don't want to be too much of a killjoy,
12900	16700	but the people on this poster are some of the worst mass murderers in human history.
16700	19500	So I asked Dave if he would hang up a fascist equivalent.
19500	23000	You know, a Welcome to the Party poster, with images of a partying Hitler,
23000	25800	maybe some other Nazi party members, maybe Mussolini's in there.
25800	26800	And he said he wouldn't.
26800	28000	Well, why not?
28000	30600	It's the same joke. They're all genocidal tyrants.
30600	32700	So why the communists, but not the Nazis?
32700	36400	In much the same vein, Nazi art collectors generally have to tread carefully,
36400	39300	while Soviet art collectors don't really have to worry about it so much.
39300	43000	In fact, Jordan Peterson, who has an extensive Soviet art collection,
43000	46300	acknowledged the hypocrisy in displaying communist propaganda in his house,
46300	48400	but refusing to display its Nazi equivalent.
48400	51500	Why is the swastika considered near-universally offensive,
51500	53900	if the hammer and sickle is still relatively innocuous?
53900	56200	When you see some idiot with a swastika in public,
56200	58600	the average person's mind immediately snaps to,
58600	60100	this guy's a proponent of genocide.
60100	63100	But when antifa types carry around communist iconography,
63100	64100	nobody bats an eye.
64100	67200	At best, people just side-eye them a bit, and carry on.
67200	69900	You might make the argument that as bad as communism is,
69900	71800	it's just more tolerable than fascism.
71800	74800	That a position on the extreme right is always going to be worse
74800	76900	than the equally extreme left position.
76900	78200	And that's just how it is.
78200	79600	Well, if that's the case,
79600	83600	then why aren't other fascist symbols treated with such impulsive revulsion?
83600	86400	If you show an average North American person the fasces,
86400	87800	a bundle of sticks with an axe in it,
87800	89800	the symbol that gives fascism its name,
89800	91400	nobody considers that offensive.
91400	94300	The fasces has been an Italian symbol of power for thousands of years,
94300	97600	but its most recent widespread use was in Mussolini's fascism.
97600	99100	It gives the ideology its name.
99100	104200	So it can't be that fascist symbols are just inherently more objectionable than communist ones.
104200	108200	Both the fasces and the hammer and sickle are symbols based in European culture,
108200	109900	Italian and Russian respectively,
109900	112700	while the Nazis lifted the swastika from Asian religions.
112700	114500	Swastika is the Indian name,
114500	116000	while in China it's the Wan,
116000	117400	and in Japan it's the Manji.
117400	122000	It can be found on and around temples dedicated to all of the major East Asian faiths.
122000	124500	And if you want to find a place of worship on a modern city map,
124500	125700	just look for the swastika.
125700	128900	Of all the symbology related to totalitarian ideologies,
128900	132800	the swastika is both the only one commonly maligned as hateful,
132800	135600	and the only one from a non-white region of the world.
135600	140000	You could make the argument that hatred of the swastika is in fact racist.
140800	142800	But that's a troll's argument.
142800	143800	It's pretty funny though.
143800	145600	Maybe you could make someone's head explode with it.
145600	147600	It doesn't solve the problem though, does it?
147600	150400	Why are the communists exempted from widespread disgust?
150400	152400	Maybe the answer is in disgust.
152400	155400	Disgust sensitivity is a measurement of, well,
155400	157200	how sensitive you are to disgust.
157200	158200	Seems obvious.
158200	161600	We have disgust reactions when we encounter something that has the potential to make us sick,
161600	164600	like rotting food or corpses or waste products.
164600	169800	The study Disgust Sensitivity and the Neurophysiology of Left-Right Political Orientation
169800	175400	from 2011 shows that not only are conservatives generally easier to disgust than liberals,
175400	179200	but that involuntary physiological responses are more pronounced when disgusted,
179200	184000	and that different areas of the brain activate when disgusted between the two political persuasions.
184000	186000	In other words, the more conservative you are,
186000	188400	the more likely it is that you're going to find something disgusting.
188400	192000	It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that fascists use the term cleansing
192000	195400	to refer to the destruction of a people, because that's quite literally what they mean.
195400	199200	But the more radically left you go, the harder it is to disgust people.
199200	200800	This has obvious benefits.
200800	206000	There are things that the right sees as disgusting and therefore wants banned or removed from society
206000	208200	that doesn't actually cause anybody any harm.
208200	212400	Sometimes the thing you find disgusting isn't actually bad and you're just too sensitive about it.
212400	217600	Yeah, disgust is one of the few times you can actually call conservatives overly sensitive snowflakes.
217600	220600	But the disgust tolerance within radical lefties is so low
220600	224000	that you often see them excusing clearly objectionable acts,
224000	227200	like the millions of deaths that communism has caused as no big deal.
227200	231800	Because hey, labeling something disgusting is just a way for the man to oppress everyone, dude.
231800	235400	The people who make those arguments, by the way, are often disgusting themselves.
235400	238400	But they'll never figure that out because they've got such a low sensitivity to it.
238400	242200	So maybe it's the case that the left's natural lower disgust sensitivity
242200	245200	allows them to more easily ignore the faults of their ideology,
245200	247400	as well as the faults within themselves.
247400	247800	Maybe.
247800	249400	But I think there's something more to it.
249400	253400	By now, we've identified the point at which the natural tendency of the right wing
253400	257400	to promote orderly social structures and maximize productivity can go too far.
257400	258900	The fascists have shown us that.
258900	260700	Conservatives obviously have a point.
260700	263100	Society needs order, it can't just all be chaos.
263100	268000	And social structures give human beings values to enshrine and pursue in order to better themselves.
268000	272700	When you hit the point of, say, racial purity and the destruction of the out-group,
272700	274000	then you've gone too far.
274000	275800	And I think that's something that we all intrinsically know,
275800	279200	which is why we react so viscerally to the swastika, without even really thinking.
279200	281300	Because we realize that, at least in the West,
281300	286100	the swastika is a symbol that represents the extreme right's proclivity to implement the tyranny of order.
286100	289000	But we don't have a clear point for when the left has gone too far.
289000	290700	There's no philosophy we can point to.
290700	293100	There's no symbol we can easily grab to represent it.
293100	298000	When extremists on the right go violent, mainstream conservatives are quick to denounce them.
298000	302200	But mainstream lefties have no problem running interference for the violence of the extreme left.
302200	306100	They won't even countenance the question of when has the left gone too far.
306100	308500	They'll say mealy-mouthed nonsense like,
308500	310700	Oh, well, the revolutionaries have a point.
310700	312000	They're not all wrong.
312000	313400	They're fighting the patriarchy.
313400	316500	Or they might even become radicalized to join the violence themselves.
316500	321100	The left's close relationship with chaos is just as important to a functioning society
321100	323300	as the right's close relationship with order.
323300	325900	Just as order creates virtue and productivity,
325900	328800	from chaos you get things like innovation and growth.
328800	333100	Order might maintain structures, but chaos creates the structure in the first place.
333100	334800	The right has no problem with boundaries.
334800	336400	They're an integral part of order.
336400	340100	But borders are poisonous to the left, because borders restrict freedom,
340100	343800	and freedom is fundamentally the left's domain, as order's opposing force.
343800	348200	So it's no surprise to me that conservatives have no problem with drawing a line in the sand and saying,
348200	350400	This is the point at which we can go too far,
350400	355100	while liberals have a much harder time differentiating between their moderates and their extremists.
355100	360400	This is why stuff like gender fluidity or transracialism comes from radical left thought as well.
360400	364000	If borders are oppressive and removing borders is an expression of freedom,
364000	366700	then the boundaries between things start to become quite blurry.
366700	370700	And that's also why stuff like racial purity comes from radical right thought,
370700	374300	because imposing a strict border on something that naturally doesn't have one,
374300	377200	race for example, is the conservative bread and butter.
377200	381600	The ultimate radical left desire is the erasure of all borders everywhere,
381600	383600	physical borders like between nations,
383600	386400	borders between race or gender or class,
386400	388400	intellectual or conceptual borders,
388400	390500	which is what the Tabula Rasa theory is based on,
390500	393700	that humans are 100% a product of their upbringing and nothing else.
393700	398900	It's no wonder that extreme left-leaning nations descend into state worship or cults of personality,
398900	403100	whether that's communist hell holes like Soviet Russia or modern super states like the EU.
403100	406600	The end goal of the ideology of communism is for it to become a deity,
406600	409300	for all peoples of the world to live in its predicted utopia,
409300	413800	and for the individual communists themselves to be revered as the chosen saint,
413800	416200	who returns from the mountaintop with heavenly wisdom.
416200	419700	The radical left seeks to be God, to replace God with the state,
419700	423600	because a thing without boundaries is simultaneously all things.
423600	427300	When some cheeky commie says real communism has never been tried,
427300	428900	this is what they mean conceptually,
428900	433300	that because theoretical communism contains the nature of reality within its purview,
433300	435400	and that nothing exists outside of it,
435400	438700	all forms of earthly communism were doomed to failure,
438700	442400	and that their chosen saints meant to bring about paradise were corrupted.
442400	446400	There's also the implication that if they were given the opportunity to be the chosen saint,
446400	447400	they could pull it off,
447400	450800	which is laughable because these types of people can't even balance their own budget.
450800	453400	We're not any closer to the answer to the question though, are we?
453400	456300	We know when the right has gone too far, racial superiority.
456300	457400	It's clearly demarked.
457400	458600	On the conservative side of things,
458600	462800	we've learned how to identify those outside of the range of acceptable political opinion,
462800	464900	but we still don't know when the left has gone too far.
464900	471300	We have no universally agreed upon identifier of when the left has strayed outside of the range of acceptable political opinion,
471300	475200	and given the left's love of freedom, which is a good thing in many respects,
475200	479500	we're still unlikely to get a straight consistent answer from any leftists on the topic,
479500	481900	because their philosophy precludes demarcation.
481900	485100	In fact, we're more likely to see the left justify its own radicals,
485100	489500	and stay silent as those radicals keep pushing the boundaries way out in crazy land.
489500	490400	So what do we do?
490400	493000	Is it just that Nazis are bad because they're racist?
493000	499100	That arbitrary discrimination based on race is the true deciding factor in evil and not killing millions of people?
499100	504000	Is Stalin morally superior to Hitler because his mass grave sites are multicultural?
504000	507600	Well, that does sound like something an SJW would say crazily enough,
507600	509600	but I refuse to accept that conclusion.
510600	514000	Well, I still consider myself a center-lefty.
514000	519300	I guess it's incumbent on me to identify the pathology within my own political wing and disassociate myself with it.
519300	522500	And if I had to put my finger on it, it would be equality of outcome.
522500	524900	Equality of opportunity is the preferred state of humanity,
524900	527700	and it's an invention of classical European liberalism, by the way.
527700	530600	But equality of outcome is a doctrine soaked in blood.
530600	533000	It states that all people should achieve the same outcomes,
533000	536000	regardless of how much effort they put in, or where they start from.
536000	538700	Firstly, it's bad because it constitutes a race to the bottom.
538700	543400	The hyper-competent people of society must be held back so that the lowest common denominator can keep up.
543400	546600	Secondly, who gets to decide what the equal outcome is?
546600	548600	Surely it would be some bureaucracy.
548600	553200	And surely the bureaucracy would have to be massive in order to encompass all human economic activity.
553200	558300	And I guarantee you, it would be staffed by exactly the type of people you don't want working in that position,
558300	560000	because that's who'd be attracted to the job.
560000	564000	And it would have to massively curtail personal freedom in order to get the job done.
564000	569900	Thirdly, how would you fractionate the oppressed classes of society such that they get their equal outcome in your estimation?
569900	573300	You can't just divvy it up between men and women and call it a day, for example.
573300	579100	Once you add race, then you've got white men, white women, black men, black women, Latino men, and so on.
579100	587500	And then when you add sexuality, you've got white gay men, white lesbian women, white straight men, white straight women, etc. etc.
587500	592500	Every time you add a variable, the number of total combinations increases exponentially.
592500	599500	And you want to do this, top-down, for every single human on the planet, across every possible metric that one could be oppressed.
599500	606800	Race, and gender, and sexuality, and trans status, and ability, and class, and attractiveness, and heritage, and languages spoken,
606800	610900	and every other possible thing that might make your life a bit harder than you think it should be?
610900	614200	No way, man. This leads to tyranny and utter destruction.
614200	620500	It's no wonder that communism collapses under a whirlwind of corruption and poverty every single fucking time it's tried.
620500	628000	The people in charge are given unfettered power to judge your life as if they were running reality itself, because that's the job they'd rather be doing.
628000	630900	I think it's reasonable to say that when a left-wing radical says,
630900	637600	I want equality of outcome, we treat it exactly like when a right-wing radical says, I want racial superiority.
637600	642500	I know they don't sound the same right away, but that's because chaos is generally a more complicated force than order,
642500	645900	and freedom by necessity encompasses more total things than restriction.
645900	650600	So it's going to be a bit messier identifying exactly where the left has gone wrong compared to the right.
650600	656700	But those two statements are absolutely moral equivalents, just like how the swastika and the hammer and sickle are.
