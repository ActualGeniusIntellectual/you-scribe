1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
My roommate Dave's got this poster stuck to his wall.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,200
It's kind of funny, it says,

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to the Party with various communist historical figures wearing party hats and partying.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,900
I can see why somebody would get a kick out of it.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,900
And I don't want to be too much of a killjoy,

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,700
but the people on this poster are some of the worst mass murderers in human history.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,500
So I asked Dave if he would hang up a fascist equivalent.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,000
You know, a Welcome to the Party poster, with images of a partying Hitler,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,800
maybe some other Nazi party members, maybe Mussolini's in there.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
And he said he wouldn't.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,000
Well, why not?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,600
It's the same joke. They're all genocidal tyrants.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,700
So why the communists, but not the Nazis?

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,400
In much the same vein, Nazi art collectors generally have to tread carefully,

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,300
while Soviet art collectors don't really have to worry about it so much.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,000
In fact, Jordan Peterson, who has an extensive Soviet art collection,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,300
acknowledged the hypocrisy in displaying communist propaganda in his house,

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,400
but refusing to display its Nazi equivalent.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,500
Why is the swastika considered near-universally offensive,

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,900
if the hammer and sickle is still relatively innocuous?

21
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,200
When you see some idiot with a swastika in public,

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,600
the average person's mind immediately snaps to,

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,100
this guy's a proponent of genocide.

24
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,100
But when antifa types carry around communist iconography,

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,100
nobody bats an eye.

26
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,200
At best, people just side-eye them a bit, and carry on.

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,900
You might make the argument that as bad as communism is,

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,800
it's just more tolerable than fascism.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,800
That a position on the extreme right is always going to be worse

30
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,900
than the equally extreme left position.

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,200
And that's just how it is.

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,600
Well, if that's the case,

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,600
then why aren't other fascist symbols treated with such impulsive revulsion?

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,400
If you show an average North American person the fasces,

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,800
a bundle of sticks with an axe in it,

36
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
the symbol that gives fascism its name,

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,400
nobody considers that offensive.

38
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,300
The fasces has been an Italian symbol of power for thousands of years,

39
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,600
but its most recent widespread use was in Mussolini's fascism.

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,100
It gives the ideology its name.

41
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,200
So it can't be that fascist symbols are just inherently more objectionable than communist ones.

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Both the fasces and the hammer and sickle are symbols based in European culture,

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,900
Italian and Russian respectively,

44
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,700
while the Nazis lifted the swastika from Asian religions.

45
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,500
Swastika is the Indian name,

46
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,000
while in China it's the Wan,

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,400
and in Japan it's the Manji.

48
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,000
It can be found on and around temples dedicated to all of the major East Asian faiths.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,500
And if you want to find a place of worship on a modern city map,

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,700
just look for the swastika.

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,900
Of all the symbology related to totalitarian ideologies,

52
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,800
the swastika is both the only one commonly maligned as hateful,

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,600
and the only one from a non-white region of the world.

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,000
You could make the argument that hatred of the swastika is in fact racist.

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
But that's a troll's argument.

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,800
It's pretty funny though.

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
Maybe you could make someone's head explode with it.

58
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
It doesn't solve the problem though, does it?

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,400
Why are the communists exempted from widespread disgust?

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Maybe the answer is in disgust.

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Disgust sensitivity is a measurement of, well,

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,200
how sensitive you are to disgust.

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Seems obvious.

64
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,600
We have disgust reactions when we encounter something that has the potential to make us sick,

65
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
like rotting food or corpses or waste products.

66
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,800
The study Disgust Sensitivity and the Neurophysiology of Left-Right Political Orientation

67
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,400
from 2011 shows that not only are conservatives generally easier to disgust than liberals,

68
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,200
but that involuntary physiological responses are more pronounced when disgusted,

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,000
and that different areas of the brain activate when disgusted between the two political persuasions.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
In other words, the more conservative you are,

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,400
the more likely it is that you're going to find something disgusting.

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,000
It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that fascists use the term cleansing

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,400
to refer to the destruction of a people, because that's quite literally what they mean.

74
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,200
But the more radically left you go, the harder it is to disgust people.

75
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,800
This has obvious benefits.

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,000
There are things that the right sees as disgusting and therefore wants banned or removed from society

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,200
that doesn't actually cause anybody any harm.

78
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,400
Sometimes the thing you find disgusting isn't actually bad and you're just too sensitive about it.

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,600
Yeah, disgust is one of the few times you can actually call conservatives overly sensitive snowflakes.

80
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
But the disgust tolerance within radical lefties is so low

81
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,000
that you often see them excusing clearly objectionable acts,

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,200
like the millions of deaths that communism has caused as no big deal.

83
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,800
Because hey, labeling something disgusting is just a way for the man to oppress everyone, dude.

84
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,400
The people who make those arguments, by the way, are often disgusting themselves.

85
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,400
But they'll never figure that out because they've got such a low sensitivity to it.

86
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,200
So maybe it's the case that the left's natural lower disgust sensitivity

87
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,200
allows them to more easily ignore the faults of their ideology,

88
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,400
as well as the faults within themselves.

89
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,800
Maybe.

90
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,400
But I think there's something more to it.

91
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,400
By now, we've identified the point at which the natural tendency of the right wing

92
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,400
to promote orderly social structures and maximize productivity can go too far.

93
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,900
The fascists have shown us that.

94
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,700
Conservatives obviously have a point.

95
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,100
Society needs order, it can't just all be chaos.

96
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,000
And social structures give human beings values to enshrine and pursue in order to better themselves.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,700
When you hit the point of, say, racial purity and the destruction of the out-group,

98
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,000
then you've gone too far.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,800
And I think that's something that we all intrinsically know,

100
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,200
which is why we react so viscerally to the swastika, without even really thinking.

101
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,300
Because we realize that, at least in the West,

102
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,100
the swastika is a symbol that represents the extreme right's proclivity to implement the tyranny of order.

103
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,000
But we don't have a clear point for when the left has gone too far.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,700
There's no philosophy we can point to.

105
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,100
There's no symbol we can easily grab to represent it.

106
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,000
When extremists on the right go violent, mainstream conservatives are quick to denounce them.

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,200
But mainstream lefties have no problem running interference for the violence of the extreme left.

108
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,100
They won't even countenance the question of when has the left gone too far.

109
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,500
They'll say mealy-mouthed nonsense like,

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,700
Oh, well, the revolutionaries have a point.

111
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,000
They're not all wrong.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,400
They're fighting the patriarchy.

113
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,500
Or they might even become radicalized to join the violence themselves.

114
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,100
The left's close relationship with chaos is just as important to a functioning society

115
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,300
as the right's close relationship with order.

116
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,900
Just as order creates virtue and productivity,

117
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,800
from chaos you get things like innovation and growth.

118
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,100
Order might maintain structures, but chaos creates the structure in the first place.

119
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,800
The right has no problem with boundaries.

120
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
They're an integral part of order.

121
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,100
But borders are poisonous to the left, because borders restrict freedom,

122
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,800
and freedom is fundamentally the left's domain, as order's opposing force.

123
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,200
So it's no surprise to me that conservatives have no problem with drawing a line in the sand and saying,

124
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,400
This is the point at which we can go too far,

125
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,100
while liberals have a much harder time differentiating between their moderates and their extremists.

126
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,400
This is why stuff like gender fluidity or transracialism comes from radical left thought as well.

127
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,000
If borders are oppressive and removing borders is an expression of freedom,

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,700
then the boundaries between things start to become quite blurry.

129
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,700
And that's also why stuff like racial purity comes from radical right thought,

130
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,300
because imposing a strict border on something that naturally doesn't have one,

131
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,200
race for example, is the conservative bread and butter.

132
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,600
The ultimate radical left desire is the erasure of all borders everywhere,

133
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
physical borders like between nations,

134
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,400
borders between race or gender or class,

135
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
intellectual or conceptual borders,

136
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,500
which is what the Tabula Rasa theory is based on,

137
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,700
that humans are 100% a product of their upbringing and nothing else.

138
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,900
It's no wonder that extreme left-leaning nations descend into state worship or cults of personality,

139
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,100
whether that's communist hell holes like Soviet Russia or modern super states like the EU.

140
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,600
The end goal of the ideology of communism is for it to become a deity,

141
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,300
for all peoples of the world to live in its predicted utopia,

142
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,800
and for the individual communists themselves to be revered as the chosen saint,

143
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,200
who returns from the mountaintop with heavenly wisdom.

144
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,700
The radical left seeks to be God, to replace God with the state,

145
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,600
because a thing without boundaries is simultaneously all things.

146
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,300
When some cheeky commie says real communism has never been tried,

147
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,900
this is what they mean conceptually,

148
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,300
that because theoretical communism contains the nature of reality within its purview,

149
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,400
and that nothing exists outside of it,

150
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,700
all forms of earthly communism were doomed to failure,

151
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,400
and that their chosen saints meant to bring about paradise were corrupted.

152
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
There's also the implication that if they were given the opportunity to be the chosen saint,

153
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
they could pull it off,

154
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,800
which is laughable because these types of people can't even balance their own budget.

155
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,400
We're not any closer to the answer to the question though, are we?

156
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,300
We know when the right has gone too far, racial superiority.

157
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,400
It's clearly demarked.

158
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,600
On the conservative side of things,

159
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,800
we've learned how to identify those outside of the range of acceptable political opinion,

160
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,900
but we still don't know when the left has gone too far.

161
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:51,300
We have no universally agreed upon identifier of when the left has strayed outside of the range of acceptable political opinion,

162
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,200
and given the left's love of freedom, which is a good thing in many respects,

163
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,500
we're still unlikely to get a straight consistent answer from any leftists on the topic,

164
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,900
because their philosophy precludes demarcation.

165
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,100
In fact, we're more likely to see the left justify its own radicals,

166
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,500
and stay silent as those radicals keep pushing the boundaries way out in crazy land.

167
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,400
So what do we do?

168
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,000
Is it just that Nazis are bad because they're racist?

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,100
That arbitrary discrimination based on race is the true deciding factor in evil and not killing millions of people?

170
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,000
Is Stalin morally superior to Hitler because his mass grave sites are multicultural?

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,600
Well, that does sound like something an SJW would say crazily enough,

172
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
but I refuse to accept that conclusion.

173
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,000
Well, I still consider myself a center-lefty.

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,300
I guess it's incumbent on me to identify the pathology within my own political wing and disassociate myself with it.

175
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,500
And if I had to put my finger on it, it would be equality of outcome.

176
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,900
Equality of opportunity is the preferred state of humanity,

177
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,700
and it's an invention of classical European liberalism, by the way.

178
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,600
But equality of outcome is a doctrine soaked in blood.

179
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,000
It states that all people should achieve the same outcomes,

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
regardless of how much effort they put in, or where they start from.

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,700
Firstly, it's bad because it constitutes a race to the bottom.

182
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,400
The hyper-competent people of society must be held back so that the lowest common denominator can keep up.

183
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,600
Secondly, who gets to decide what the equal outcome is?

184
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Surely it would be some bureaucracy.

185
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,200
And surely the bureaucracy would have to be massive in order to encompass all human economic activity.

186
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,300
And I guarantee you, it would be staffed by exactly the type of people you don't want working in that position,

187
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,000
because that's who'd be attracted to the job.

188
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And it would have to massively curtail personal freedom in order to get the job done.

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,900
Thirdly, how would you fractionate the oppressed classes of society such that they get their equal outcome in your estimation?

190
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,300
You can't just divvy it up between men and women and call it a day, for example.

191
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:39,100
Once you add race, then you've got white men, white women, black men, black women, Latino men, and so on.

192
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:47,500
And then when you add sexuality, you've got white gay men, white lesbian women, white straight men, white straight women, etc. etc.

193
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Every time you add a variable, the number of total combinations increases exponentially.

194
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,500
And you want to do this, top-down, for every single human on the planet, across every possible metric that one could be oppressed.

195
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:06,800
Race, and gender, and sexuality, and trans status, and ability, and class, and attractiveness, and heritage, and languages spoken,

196
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,900
and every other possible thing that might make your life a bit harder than you think it should be?

197
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,200
No way, man. This leads to tyranny and utter destruction.

198
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,500
It's no wonder that communism collapses under a whirlwind of corruption and poverty every single fucking time it's tried.

199
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:28,000
The people in charge are given unfettered power to judge your life as if they were running reality itself, because that's the job they'd rather be doing.

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,900
I think it's reasonable to say that when a left-wing radical says,

201
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:37,600
I want equality of outcome, we treat it exactly like when a right-wing radical says, I want racial superiority.

202
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,500
I know they don't sound the same right away, but that's because chaos is generally a more complicated force than order,

203
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,900
and freedom by necessity encompasses more total things than restriction.

204
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,600
So it's going to be a bit messier identifying exactly where the left has gone wrong compared to the right.

205
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,700
But those two statements are absolutely moral equivalents, just like how the swastika and the hammer and sickle are.
