1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
Alright, usually I don't do such a blatant sequel to a previous video, but this time

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,600
it's really, really worth it.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,160
About a month ago I put out a video about the subreddit r slash anti work.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,480
Anti work began as a community where people would post text conversations between them

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,840
and their shitty bosses.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,420
The bosses would always demand something amazingly stupid from the OP.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,100
The OP has enough and decides to quit over text, leaving the boss high and dry.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,060
It was a cathartic sub, where you got to see stuff like people's rightfully earned and

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,260
properly scheduled vacations cancelled last minute to cover up a manager's mistake,

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,240
and then when the manager tries to force the worker to shut up and do as they're told,

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,540
the worker walks leaving the manager holding the bag.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,220
Everyone's had a shit boss before, we all have felt this way.

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,940
However, after the community went viral, it rapidly got co-opted by communists, who loudly

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,940
proclaimed that anti work was always communist oriented, and that the sub was not a repository

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,100
for funny I quit fuck you boss stories, but instead existed to agitate for anti capitalist

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,300
political action.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,480
And yes, this is unfortunately what anti work morphed into over time.

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,940
It's just so stupid.

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,320
Quitting your job and finding a better one isn't socialist praxis, it's liberal capitalism

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,380
working as intended.

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,300
You make an agreement with your boss to do X job for Y hours for Z pay.

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,400
If you can't come to an agreement that you're both satisfied with, then you walk.

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,300
That's exactly what the workers did, they walked, they exercised their rights.

24
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,020
Just as your employer exercises their rights when they fire you, if you're not upholding

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,900
your end of the agreement, either.

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,940
Capitalism is an inherently adversarial system.

27
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,940
That's a feature of it.

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,940
It's a good thing.

29
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,300
Boss and worker represent two opposing camps, each pulling in their own direction and a

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,780
compromise is struck in the middle.

31
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,740
If it can't be struck, then there's no deal.

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,740
This is all how it's supposed to work.

33
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, the reason I'm talking about this again, is because a mod of anti work was invited

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,140
onto Fox News to describe the sub and the movement.

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,140
You've got to see this shit.

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,780
Joining me now is the person who operates this anti work group.

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,580
Oh my God, it really is your average Reddit.

38
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,580
They do it for free moderator.

39
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,780
You don't think you could have showered before coming on?

40
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:03,140
All right, so Doreen, why do you like the idea of being home, not working, but still

41
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,780
getting paid by corporate America?

42
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,020
Yeah, so there's a misconceptions about the movement.

43
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:16,460
So we're a movement where we want to reduce the amount of work that people feel like they

44
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,780
they're forced to do.

45
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,360
Dude, look at the smirk on the host's face.

46
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,220
He's like, am I literally talking to a teenager?

47
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,180
He doesn't want to get a summer job.

48
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,420
And so we want to still put in effort.

49
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:32,460
We want to put in labor, but we don't want to necessarily be in a position where we feel

50
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
trapped.

51
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,820
You know, you just quoted from office space where that person feels very trapped in their

52
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,820
job.

53
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,260
And I think we're calling for a society where there's less of that.

54
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,260
But yeah, absolutely.

55
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,220
People still want to do things.

56
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,560
They just want to do things where they feel rewarded and they feel like they're in a good

57
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,460
spot in their life and that their job respects them and stuff like that.

58
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,820
That's all pretty reasonable.

59
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,860
That's why you quit jobs and move on again.

60
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,860
Working as intended.

61
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,020
You know, there's varying.

62
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,700
So you're so Doreen, you're not being forced to work.

63
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,180
This isn't this isn't slave labor.

64
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,500
You've applied for a job.

65
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,820
You've agreed to the terms and conditions of the employment.

66
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,860
And you know, you can walk away from that job at any time and quit.

67
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,220
So I don't understand really what this is about, except it sounds like maybe people

68
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,860
are just being lazy.

69
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,380
Are you encouraging people to be lazy?

70
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:34,020
So I think laziness is a virtue in a society where people constantly want you to be productive

71
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,020
24 seven.

72
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Yes.

73
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,380
Yes, I can tell that you think laziness is a virtue.

74
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,380
Jesus Christ.

75
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,660
And it's good to have rest.

76
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,400
That doesn't mean you should be resting all the time or not putting effort into things

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
that you care about.

78
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,100
But I think one of the issues is like a good work day.

79
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,540
How many hours is, you know, a solid work day in your ideal society?

80
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,540
Sure.

81
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,800
I mean, I think as much as people want, I mean, I personally work I have I have like

82
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,920
a 20, 25 hour work weeks, which I think is fairly good.

83
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,960
So I would like less work hours.

84
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,360
And what do you do, Doreen?

85
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,600
I'm a dog walker.

86
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,600
A dog walker.

87
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
Okay.

88
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Yes.

89
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Oh, God.

90
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
I just realized this person's trans.

91
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Doreen.

92
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Yep.

93
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Fuck.

94
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,720
Well, I guess the dog walker thing makes sense now.

95
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,880
Ever since I've made that fucking video, I've been surrounded by dog pills, guys.

96
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,100
I see them everywhere I go.

97
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,100
And how?

98
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Yeah.

99
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
So how old are you?

100
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,100
If you don't mind me asking.

101
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
Sure.

102
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,100
I'm 30.

103
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,100
You're 30.

104
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,100
Okay.

105
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,100
I'm 30.

106
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,100
Fuck.

107
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,180
I know I get flack for streaming video games and making YouTube videos for my money, but

108
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,180
shit.

109
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,580
And is there something you want to do besides being a dog walker, do you aspire to do anything

110
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,580
more than dog walking?

111
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,360
Or is that kind of your your pinnacle?

112
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,280
I love working with dogs.

113
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,420
If I had to do this for the rest of my life, you know, I wouldn't be super complaining.

114
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,080
You know, dogs are wonderful animals, but I mean, I would love to teach.

115
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,140
I would love to Oh, God, look at the face of the host.

116
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,500
He knows what's going on here.

117
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,380
You know, work with work with people and stuff like that.

118
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,380
What would you teach Doreen?

119
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,420
A philosophy mostly philosophy, philosophy, critical thinking reasons, stuff like that.

120
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,420
Okay.

121
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,380
Well, I would love to take your class Doreen.

122
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,540
I would just be taking notes the whole time.

123
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:28,460
And you know what, a professor is a very similar schedule than something that you're imagining.

124
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,380
So I think that actually might might work perfectly for you.

125
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,620
I think this might not be the greatest idea, but who am I to judge?

126
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,660
To each their own, they say.

127
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,660
It's a free country.

128
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,660
Sure.

129
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,700
Not everything's free.

130
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,460
But it is a free country.

131
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,460
Thank you so much.

132
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,460
We got to run.

133
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,460
We got to pay the bills.

134
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,460
Holy fuck.

135
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,240
I know this wasn't an online debate, but Doreen here sure got dumpster like this was the primetime

136
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,420
morning kumite internet bloodsports.

137
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,640
Like the Fox News guy was only asking surface level stuff.

138
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,540
It was all softball questions.

139
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,580
And the anti work mod just fumbled it.

140
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,900
All you have to do is say something like we believe the workers showing the means of production.

141
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,100
I mean, these people say that shit constantly everywhere else.

142
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
What happened?

143
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,100
Your commies own it.

144
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,560
Instead, Doreen walked into an obvious bait and switch where the Fox News host successfully

145
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,180
made the entire movement look like lazy layabouts and bums because on at least some level that's

146
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,260
what they are.

147
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,320
And the rest of the movement was not happy about it.

148
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,100
The video was posted to r slash anti work where Doreen, the interviewed mod responded

149
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,340
under the name of abolish work and oh boy was that video considered a dumpster fire

150
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,940
by everybody.

151
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,780
Abolish work said that they're autistic, which is why they kept fidgeting and refusing to

152
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,780
look at the camera.

153
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,240
Another user asked, did you share the offer for an interview with the other mods beforehand?

154
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,380
Did you all decide you were the best person to represent this sub on Fox?

155
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,940
If so, that might have been slightly misguided and abolish work replied with the interview

156
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,580
offer was given to the mods via mod mail and they specifically asked for me.

157
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,580
I shared that with the other mods and they all agreed that I was probably the best to

158
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,900
do it because I've done other media.

159
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,940
Yeah, that was a big fat whoops.

160
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,240
Last interview, abolish work turned into a lightning rod for everything wrong with the

161
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,460
anti work movement and the entire sub decided that they were public enemy number one.

162
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,940
This whole debacle can be summed up with something we've known for a very long time.

163
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,640
Moderators are losers.

164
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,180
The sub is imploding before our very eyes exactly what Fox wanted.

165
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,700
The mod got softball questions.

166
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,940
I can't even blame Fox.

167
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,700
Who's the mad lad that stickied this thread?

168
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,960
The girls are infighting.

169
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,580
The mega thread they created to corral the storm was locked and unpinned inside of 30

170
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,580
minutes.

171
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,580
Is their mod infighting?

172
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,680
And the answer to that is yes.

173
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,680
The mod team of r slash anti work began actually ripping into each other with some wanting

174
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,100
to bury everything and cover it up and others venting their disappointment and wanting the

175
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,320
community to be able to do the same because of abolish works status as a trans woman.

176
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,820
It rapidly became the party line that critiquing their interview performance was transphobic

177
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,580
off topic and brigading the sub.

178
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,640
The users continued to complain and the mods labeled them all bad actors just like any

179
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,420
other power tripping modern isolated small community online that blows up.

180
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,920
It's a tale as old as time.

181
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,880
In fact, a tale far older than the internet.

182
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,320
Here's a private conversation between abolish work and some of the sub's users.

183
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Step down.

184
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
We don't want you.

185
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
We don't like you.

186
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
It's not because you're trans.

187
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
I'm an ally.

188
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
I respect your identity.

189
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
But I don't respect your behavior since the interview.

190
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,360
I don't respect how you've made a laughing stock out of us.

191
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,320
I don't respect how you've failed to communicate any of the philosophies you represent.

192
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,560
You made a mistake big enough that you need to step down.

193
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Not gonna happen.

194
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,400
Your actions are fully admitting that you care more about your status as a mod than

195
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,880
you do the community you moderate.

196
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,880
We don't like you.

197
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,880
We don't want you.

198
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,880
Step down.

199
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
I'm not in this to be liked.

200
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,520
If I was I wouldn't be doing politics lol.

201
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Then what are you in this for?

202
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,920
Because it's clearly not in the interest of the community for you to remain a mod.

203
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,760
So if you were in it because of the movement, you'd step down, right?

204
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,960
What is the reason you're being so thick headed about this?

205
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
And don't delude yourself.

206
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
You're not doing politics.

207
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,840
You're the mod of a subreddit and a dog walker.

208
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,020
I'm the mod of a political subreddit lol.

209
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,660
We literally gave a ton of aid to the Kellogg strikers.

210
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,280
So yeah, it's a political movement, and I don't really care if y'all don't like

211
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
me.

212
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,000
The larger community and the movement seems to agree that you do not belong in your position

213
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
anymore.

214
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,580
With this in mind, why aren't you stepping down?

215
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,600
If your interest really was in the movement, then you'd step aside and let other people

216
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
lead for a while.

217
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,800
You can't be so ignorant to not realize that when a movement has a poor leadership,

218
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
it's doomed to fail.

219
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,560
We're all trying to let you know that you aren't a good leader.

220
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,280
So if you really actually cared about the movement, and if you really aren't as thick

221
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,560
as people say you are, then why would you not step down?

222
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,240
I mean, please, for all of our sake, take your ego out of the equation.

223
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,720
I get you're probably feeling bad because you're getting a lot of hate, but try to

224
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
be objective.

225
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,560
Try to take a step back and realize that this is bigger than you.

226
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,920
You don't want to be the reason the movement tanked.

227
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,640
My ego isn't controlling me.

228
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,760
Y'all are being ridiculous and there has been no vote about whether or not I'm going

229
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,760
to be a mod.

230
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,280
And even if there was, I wouldn't care.

231
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,800
Mids aren't democratically elected and this isn't a democracy.

232
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,560
We may strive for as much user input as possible in certain circumstances, but I'm not going

233
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,920
to apologize or resign for a situation that was tainted from the beginning.

234
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,200
Now, Abolish Work is an anarchist, I think an anarcho-communist specifically.

235
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,960
This is somebody who follows a philosophy of explicit anti-hierarchy and communitarianism.

236
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,800
But now that they've got just a single drop of power, literally a drop, it's a fucking

237
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,920
reddit moderator position, they're out here spouting shit like this isn't a democracy

238
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,360
and I'm not going to resign just because it's popular for me to do so.

239
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,780
I said it in a previous video and I'll say it again.

240
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,920
There are no anarchists.

241
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,740
Anarchism is a philosophy that is fucking stupid.

242
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,480
There are people who larp as anarchists as a means to an end.

243
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,740
They want the slate wiped clean, not to abolish hierarchy, but so that they may build new

244
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,420
hierarchy with them at the top unimpeded.

245
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,560
That accurately describes every single anarchist out there.

246
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Without exception.

247
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
I trust none of these fuckers.

248
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Revolution!

249
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,560
The big helmeted Pakleds will no longer control us.

250
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Ooh.

251
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,560
I am now Pakled leader.

252
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
Behold!

253
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
My giant helmet!

254
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,840
Eventually, as the mods of the subreddit finally solidified their stance and united in opposition

255
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,960
to their own user base, the user revolt came to a head with this post.

256
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Sorry, doesn't cut it.

257
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
You have no power here.

258
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,600
You can modify comments, you can delete comments, you can delete threads, and that is the extent

259
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,280
of the power that you hold as a mod.

260
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,480
This is not to attack you, but it is to remind you that you should have no influence over

261
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,880
the sub, and if you are having influence over the sub, then there is something immensely

262
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
wrong.

263
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,880
I can't believe how painfully ironic it is that you have some authority and you've

264
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,040
exerted it incorrectly and then immediately refuse to acknowledge it or correct it on

265
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,500
this sub which is literally dedicated to holding those who do exactly what you did accountable.

266
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,160
How can you possibly be blind to this painful irony?

267
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,720
Well, because they're anarchists.

268
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,720
I think I've said this in ten fucking videos at this point.

269
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,280
There are no libertarian socialists.

270
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,300
There are only tankies in waiting.

271
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,320
The mods banned every single person who criticized Abolish Work, who criticized the mods handling

272
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,360
of the revolt, and who posted it in the anti-work drama thread on cringetopia.

273
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
They basically went scorched earth with this shit.

274
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,180
Eventually the sub was fully closed and most of the users migrated over to r slash work

275
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,680
reform where they continued their communist larping and dreaming while people who just

276
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,760
wanted funny I quit stories to have been left out to dry.

277
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,100
As of this morning, the anti-work sub is actually back, but the same mod team is still in charge

278
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,960
and they're still being pretty heavy handed.

279
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
It's dead Jim.

280
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,640
That's not spicy enough of an ending to this story, is it?

281
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,980
Surely I've found something else that puts a nice little bow on all of this.

282
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,200
This is from Abolish Work's Facebook account.

283
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:59,480
The person accusing me of serial rape and I were involved in sexual conduct.

284
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,040
This scenario involved alcohol on their part, but I had been informed multiple times that

285
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,200
it wasn't a big deal.

286
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,640
They said they were only tipsy and that they were consenting to what was happening.

287
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,320
I took them at their word and I will be more responsible in the future when it comes to

288
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,480
alcohol and sex.

289
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,920
I'm unaware of who I've allegedly raped besides the person making the accusation.

290
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,500
The only other person I can think of is a previous partner.

291
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,240
I take consent very seriously.

292
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,680
And here's that other story.

293
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,920
I wrote this a long while ago in case this situation ever happened and sadly here it

294
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
is.

295
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,500
I strive to be open and honest.

296
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,780
Those who are close to me can verify that I exude those qualities more than any other.

297
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,520
It's in that spirit that I make public certain past events within my life.

298
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,520
I want to discuss a history I have with someone that I used to know.

299
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,320
This was a person with whom I had an ongoing sexual relationship and living arrangement.

300
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,980
Eventually, a mix of fundamentally incompatible needs, past trauma unrelated to me, and my

301
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,200
issues with impulsive control resulted in a very unhealthy dynamic between us.

302
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,940
Due to my dislike of call-out culture, this person will remain anonymous.

303
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,640
This individual had past trauma from previous relationships that caused emotional and physical

304
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,880
distance between us over the course of months.

305
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,540
This led to my needs going unmet, which led to masturbation as an unhealthy coping mechanism.

306
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,440
After months of trying to keep myself in check, I began sporadically masturbating while they

307
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,980
slept next to me.

308
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,020
Even though they stated this made them feel uncomfortable, these events continued to happen

309
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,720
until I sought help through therapy.

310
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,400
I had woken up one morning with them laying next to me and remembering they felt uncomfortable

311
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,980
with me masturbating next to them while they slept.

312
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,040
I placed their hand over my boxers.

313
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,760
They moved their hand away and I thought nothing at what happened and fell back asleep.

314
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,920
They later woke up and mentioned to me that they had a nightmare involving these series

315
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
of events.

316
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,680
I admitted that it had happened, apologized, and explained that I was half asleep and not

317
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,880
in full control of my actions.

318
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,560
Lastly, the previously mentioned coping mechanism resulted in this person creating alarms for

319
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,180
us so we wouldn't fall asleep together and thus boundary violations would be minimized.

320
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,300
Much to my retrospective disgust, my desperation for emotional intimacy led me to shut off

321
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,740
the alarms at various points.

322
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,060
When I learned how much this harmed this person, I soon went to therapy.

323
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,380
Thereafter I was better able to cope with my impulsive tendencies and thus consistently

324
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,860
respect their boundaries.

325
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,340
Resulting from my remorse, I made a financial contribution to an organization dedicated

326
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,140
to helping people in alternative but abusive relationships.

327
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,060
There was discussion between me and this individual of helping with therapy costs, however given

328
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,200
my economic status and their insurance coverage, we decided against it.

329
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,040
As well, I've used that unhealthy dynamic as a way to improve myself, my relationships

330
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,360
since then have been healthy and mutually beneficial.

331
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,800
These events have led me to suffer several symptoms of PTSD, sporadic suicidal ideation

332
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
and self-esteem loss.

333
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,920
I've done my best to heal by privately talking to multiple friends about this, but I think

334
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
I need to do more than that.

335
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,500
Throughout my life, I have striven to be a respectful and compassionate person.

336
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,480
That means that when others are too good about their boundaries, I want to be sensitive to

337
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
them and respectful of them.

338
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,440
And if I discover after the fact that I violated somebody's boundaries and want to apologize

339
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,360
and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

340
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,220
I am embarrassed and regretful that even after learning how much it harmed them, I

341
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,400
still engage in it after the fact.

342
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,600
I don't know what coming forward with this information will do, but I hope everyone can

343
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,540
still trust me to do what is right and hold myself responsible and accountable when I

344
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,540
make mistakes.

345
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,940
The only comments I'll be accepting on this thread are clarifying questions and constructive

346
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,260
criticisms that are coming from a good and supportive place.

347
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,160
Shaming me in an attempt to show that my actions were wrong is both unproductive and unnecessary

348
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,740
as I am well aware of my actions and their lack of morality.

349
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:30,500
I know I shouldn't be laughing, it's sexual assault, but my god, you're presenting this

350
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,860
like you're the victim of the sexual assault, but you're the fucking perpetrator.

351
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,940
Read this garbage again.

352
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,020
Due to my dislike of call out culture, this person will remain anonymous.

353
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:44,220
You're the one who needs to be called out, even by the cancel culture brigade.

354
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,260
You're the one who's in the wrong here, not the victim.

355
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,260
Jesus Christ.

356
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,460
So this person, this person who went on Fox News and single handedly destroyed a movement,

357
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,620
they would lie next to somebody and masturbate, and then grab their arm and move their hand

358
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,320
over their dick, even as they were told to stop repeatedly.

359
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,940
And when this other person started setting alarms so that they wouldn't be asleep at

360
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,260
the same time, you would shut the alarms off and then go back to masturbating.

361
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,380
Jesus fucking Christ, oh my god.

362
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,260
The boat has finally sunk and it's still somehow on fire.

363
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,520
Why is it always, always, always, always, always a leftoid sex pest behind this shit

364
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,700
any time something like this happens?

365
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,440
This is what happens every single fucking time.

366
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,660
You have these people who are larping about being communist revolutionaries, they want

367
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,820
to overthrow capitalism, they want to seize the means of production, and yet all they

368
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,740
do is infight because it turns out that they're all just scum fucks, and as soon as one of

369
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,480
them is actually publicly revealed as a scum fuck, they all turn on each other.

370
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,940
Because there are no actual virtuous actors within this movement.

371
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,940
But you know what?

372
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,940
I've solved the mystery.

373
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,540
The only reason behind why the mods of r slash anti work closed the subreddit is that modding

374
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,580
the community was just too much work.
