00:00.000 --> 00:09.320
Alright, usually I don't do such a blatant sequel to a previous video, but this time

00:09.320 --> 00:10.600
it's really, really worth it.

00:10.600 --> 00:14.160
About a month ago I put out a video about the subreddit r slash anti work.

00:14.160 --> 00:17.480
Anti work began as a community where people would post text conversations between them

00:17.480 --> 00:18.840
and their shitty bosses.

00:18.840 --> 00:22.420
The bosses would always demand something amazingly stupid from the OP.

00:22.420 --> 00:26.100
The OP has enough and decides to quit over text, leaving the boss high and dry.

00:26.100 --> 00:30.060
It was a cathartic sub, where you got to see stuff like people's rightfully earned and

00:30.060 --> 00:34.260
properly scheduled vacations cancelled last minute to cover up a manager's mistake,

00:34.260 --> 00:37.240
and then when the manager tries to force the worker to shut up and do as they're told,

00:37.240 --> 00:39.540
the worker walks leaving the manager holding the bag.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.220
Everyone's had a shit boss before, we all have felt this way.

00:42.220 --> 00:46.940
However, after the community went viral, it rapidly got co-opted by communists, who loudly

00:46.940 --> 00:50.940
proclaimed that anti work was always communist oriented, and that the sub was not a repository

00:50.940 --> 00:56.100
for funny I quit fuck you boss stories, but instead existed to agitate for anti capitalist

00:56.100 --> 00:57.300
political action.

00:57.300 --> 01:01.480
And yes, this is unfortunately what anti work morphed into over time.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.940
It's just so stupid.

01:02.940 --> 01:07.320
Quitting your job and finding a better one isn't socialist praxis, it's liberal capitalism

01:07.320 --> 01:08.380
working as intended.

01:08.380 --> 01:12.300
You make an agreement with your boss to do X job for Y hours for Z pay.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.400
If you can't come to an agreement that you're both satisfied with, then you walk.

01:15.400 --> 01:18.300
That's exactly what the workers did, they walked, they exercised their rights.

01:18.300 --> 01:22.020
Just as your employer exercises their rights when they fire you, if you're not upholding

01:22.020 --> 01:23.900
your end of the agreement, either.

01:23.900 --> 01:25.940
Capitalism is an inherently adversarial system.

01:25.940 --> 01:26.940
That's a feature of it.

01:26.940 --> 01:27.940
It's a good thing.

01:27.940 --> 01:31.300
Boss and worker represent two opposing camps, each pulling in their own direction and a

01:31.300 --> 01:32.780
compromise is struck in the middle.

01:32.780 --> 01:34.740
If it can't be struck, then there's no deal.

01:34.740 --> 01:36.740
This is all how it's supposed to work.

01:36.740 --> 01:41.000
Well, the reason I'm talking about this again, is because a mod of anti work was invited

01:41.000 --> 01:44.140
onto Fox News to describe the sub and the movement.

01:44.140 --> 01:45.140
You've got to see this shit.

01:45.140 --> 01:48.780
Joining me now is the person who operates this anti work group.

01:48.780 --> 01:51.580
Oh my God, it really is your average Reddit.

01:51.580 --> 01:52.580
They do it for free moderator.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.780
You don't think you could have showered before coming on?

01:54.780 --> 02:03.140
All right, so Doreen, why do you like the idea of being home, not working, but still

02:03.140 --> 02:06.780
getting paid by corporate America?

02:06.780 --> 02:11.020
Yeah, so there's a misconceptions about the movement.

02:11.020 --> 02:16.460
So we're a movement where we want to reduce the amount of work that people feel like they

02:16.460 --> 02:17.780
they're forced to do.

02:17.780 --> 02:20.360
Dude, look at the smirk on the host's face.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.220
He's like, am I literally talking to a teenager?

02:22.220 --> 02:24.180
He doesn't want to get a summer job.

02:24.180 --> 02:26.420
And so we want to still put in effort.

02:26.420 --> 02:32.460
We want to put in labor, but we don't want to necessarily be in a position where we feel

02:32.460 --> 02:33.460
trapped.

02:33.460 --> 02:36.820
You know, you just quoted from office space where that person feels very trapped in their

02:36.820 --> 02:37.820
job.

02:37.820 --> 02:42.260
And I think we're calling for a society where there's less of that.

02:42.260 --> 02:43.260
But yeah, absolutely.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.220
People still want to do things.

02:45.220 --> 02:49.560
They just want to do things where they feel rewarded and they feel like they're in a good

02:49.560 --> 02:54.460
spot in their life and that their job respects them and stuff like that.

02:54.460 --> 02:55.820
That's all pretty reasonable.

02:55.820 --> 02:57.860
That's why you quit jobs and move on again.

02:57.860 --> 02:58.860
Working as intended.

02:58.860 --> 03:00.020
You know, there's varying.

03:00.020 --> 03:03.700
So you're so Doreen, you're not being forced to work.

03:03.700 --> 03:06.180
This isn't this isn't slave labor.

03:06.180 --> 03:08.500
You've applied for a job.

03:08.500 --> 03:12.820
You've agreed to the terms and conditions of the employment.

03:12.820 --> 03:16.860
And you know, you can walk away from that job at any time and quit.

03:16.860 --> 03:22.220
So I don't understand really what this is about, except it sounds like maybe people

03:22.220 --> 03:23.860
are just being lazy.

03:23.860 --> 03:27.380
Are you encouraging people to be lazy?

03:27.380 --> 03:34.020
So I think laziness is a virtue in a society where people constantly want you to be productive

03:34.020 --> 03:35.020
24 seven.

03:35.020 --> 03:36.020
Yes.

03:36.020 --> 03:38.380
Yes, I can tell that you think laziness is a virtue.

03:38.380 --> 03:39.380
Jesus Christ.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.660
And it's good to have rest.

03:41.660 --> 03:45.400
That doesn't mean you should be resting all the time or not putting effort into things

03:45.400 --> 03:46.400
that you care about.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.100
But I think one of the issues is like a good work day.

03:49.100 --> 03:53.540
How many hours is, you know, a solid work day in your ideal society?

03:53.540 --> 03:54.540
Sure.

03:54.540 --> 03:59.800
I mean, I think as much as people want, I mean, I personally work I have I have like

03:59.800 --> 04:03.920
a 20, 25 hour work weeks, which I think is fairly good.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.960
So I would like less work hours.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.360
And what do you do, Doreen?

04:08.360 --> 04:09.600
I'm a dog walker.

04:09.600 --> 04:10.600
A dog walker.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.600
Okay.

04:11.600 --> 04:12.600
Yes.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.600
Oh, God.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.600
I just realized this person's trans.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.600
Doreen.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.600
Yep.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.600
Fuck.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.720
Well, I guess the dog walker thing makes sense now.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.880
Ever since I've made that fucking video, I've been surrounded by dog pills, guys.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.100
I see them everywhere I go.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.100
And how?

04:26.100 --> 04:27.100
Yeah.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.100
So how old are you?

04:28.100 --> 04:29.100
If you don't mind me asking.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.100
Sure.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.100
I'm 30.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.100
You're 30.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.100
Okay.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.100
I'm 30.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.100
Fuck.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.180
I know I get flack for streaming video games and making YouTube videos for my money, but

04:38.180 --> 04:39.180
shit.

04:39.180 --> 04:43.580
And is there something you want to do besides being a dog walker, do you aspire to do anything

04:43.580 --> 04:44.580
more than dog walking?

04:44.580 --> 04:48.360
Or is that kind of your your pinnacle?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.280
I love working with dogs.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.420
If I had to do this for the rest of my life, you know, I wouldn't be super complaining.

04:53.420 --> 04:57.080
You know, dogs are wonderful animals, but I mean, I would love to teach.

04:57.080 --> 05:02.140
I would love to Oh, God, look at the face of the host.

05:02.180 --> 05:03.500
He knows what's going on here.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.380
You know, work with work with people and stuff like that.

05:06.380 --> 05:09.380
What would you teach Doreen?

05:09.380 --> 05:14.420
A philosophy mostly philosophy, philosophy, critical thinking reasons, stuff like that.

05:14.420 --> 05:15.420
Okay.

05:15.420 --> 05:18.380
Well, I would love to take your class Doreen.

05:18.380 --> 05:21.540
I would just be taking notes the whole time.

05:21.540 --> 05:28.460
And you know what, a professor is a very similar schedule than something that you're imagining.

05:28.460 --> 05:31.380
So I think that actually might might work perfectly for you.

05:31.700 --> 05:35.620
I think this might not be the greatest idea, but who am I to judge?

05:35.620 --> 05:37.660
To each their own, they say.

05:37.660 --> 05:39.660
It's a free country.

05:39.660 --> 05:40.660
Sure.

05:40.660 --> 05:41.700
Not everything's free.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.460
But it is a free country.

05:43.460 --> 05:44.460
Thank you so much.

05:44.460 --> 05:45.460
We got to run.

05:45.460 --> 05:46.460
We got to pay the bills.

05:46.460 --> 05:47.460
Holy fuck.

05:47.460 --> 05:52.240
I know this wasn't an online debate, but Doreen here sure got dumpster like this was the primetime

05:52.240 --> 05:54.420
morning kumite internet bloodsports.

05:54.420 --> 05:57.640
Like the Fox News guy was only asking surface level stuff.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.540
It was all softball questions.

05:59.540 --> 06:01.580
And the anti work mod just fumbled it.

06:01.580 --> 06:04.900
All you have to do is say something like we believe the workers showing the means of production.

06:04.900 --> 06:07.100
I mean, these people say that shit constantly everywhere else.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.100
What happened?

06:08.100 --> 06:09.100
Your commies own it.

06:09.100 --> 06:13.560
Instead, Doreen walked into an obvious bait and switch where the Fox News host successfully

06:13.560 --> 06:18.180
made the entire movement look like lazy layabouts and bums because on at least some level that's

06:18.180 --> 06:19.260
what they are.

06:19.260 --> 06:22.320
And the rest of the movement was not happy about it.

06:22.320 --> 06:27.100
The video was posted to r slash anti work where Doreen, the interviewed mod responded

06:27.100 --> 06:31.340
under the name of abolish work and oh boy was that video considered a dumpster fire

06:31.340 --> 06:32.940
by everybody.

06:32.940 --> 06:35.780
Abolish work said that they're autistic, which is why they kept fidgeting and refusing to

06:35.780 --> 06:36.780
look at the camera.

06:36.780 --> 06:40.240
Another user asked, did you share the offer for an interview with the other mods beforehand?

06:40.240 --> 06:43.380
Did you all decide you were the best person to represent this sub on Fox?

06:43.380 --> 06:46.940
If so, that might have been slightly misguided and abolish work replied with the interview

06:46.940 --> 06:50.580
offer was given to the mods via mod mail and they specifically asked for me.

06:50.580 --> 06:53.580
I shared that with the other mods and they all agreed that I was probably the best to

06:53.580 --> 06:54.900
do it because I've done other media.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.940
Yeah, that was a big fat whoops.

06:56.940 --> 07:00.240
Last interview, abolish work turned into a lightning rod for everything wrong with the

07:00.240 --> 07:04.460
anti work movement and the entire sub decided that they were public enemy number one.

07:04.460 --> 07:07.940
This whole debacle can be summed up with something we've known for a very long time.

07:07.940 --> 07:09.640
Moderators are losers.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.180
The sub is imploding before our very eyes exactly what Fox wanted.

07:13.180 --> 07:14.700
The mod got softball questions.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.940
I can't even blame Fox.

07:15.940 --> 07:17.700
Who's the mad lad that stickied this thread?

07:17.700 --> 07:18.960
The girls are infighting.

07:18.960 --> 07:22.580
The mega thread they created to corral the storm was locked and unpinned inside of 30

07:22.580 --> 07:23.580
minutes.

07:23.580 --> 07:24.580
Is their mod infighting?

07:24.580 --> 07:25.680
And the answer to that is yes.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.680
The mod team of r slash anti work began actually ripping into each other with some wanting

07:29.680 --> 07:33.100
to bury everything and cover it up and others venting their disappointment and wanting the

07:33.100 --> 07:37.320
community to be able to do the same because of abolish works status as a trans woman.

07:37.320 --> 07:40.820
It rapidly became the party line that critiquing their interview performance was transphobic

07:40.820 --> 07:42.580
off topic and brigading the sub.

07:42.580 --> 07:46.640
The users continued to complain and the mods labeled them all bad actors just like any

07:46.640 --> 07:50.420
other power tripping modern isolated small community online that blows up.

07:50.420 --> 07:51.920
It's a tale as old as time.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.880
In fact, a tale far older than the internet.

07:53.880 --> 07:57.320
Here's a private conversation between abolish work and some of the sub's users.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.320
Step down.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.320
We don't want you.

07:59.320 --> 08:00.320
We don't like you.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.320
It's not because you're trans.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.320
I'm an ally.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.320
I respect your identity.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.320
But I don't respect your behavior since the interview.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.360
I don't respect how you've made a laughing stock out of us.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.320
I don't respect how you've failed to communicate any of the philosophies you represent.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.560
You made a mistake big enough that you need to step down.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.560
Not gonna happen.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.400
Your actions are fully admitting that you care more about your status as a mod than

08:15.400 --> 08:16.880
you do the community you moderate.

08:16.880 --> 08:17.880
We don't like you.

08:17.880 --> 08:18.880
We don't want you.

08:18.880 --> 08:19.880
Step down.

08:19.880 --> 08:20.880
I'm not in this to be liked.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.520
If I was I wouldn't be doing politics lol.

08:22.520 --> 08:23.520
Then what are you in this for?

08:24.160 --> 08:26.920
Because it's clearly not in the interest of the community for you to remain a mod.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.760
So if you were in it because of the movement, you'd step down, right?

08:29.760 --> 08:31.960
What is the reason you're being so thick headed about this?

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
And don't delude yourself.

08:32.960 --> 08:33.960
You're not doing politics.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.840
You're the mod of a subreddit and a dog walker.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.020
I'm the mod of a political subreddit lol.

08:38.020 --> 08:40.660
We literally gave a ton of aid to the Kellogg strikers.

08:40.660 --> 08:43.280
So yeah, it's a political movement, and I don't really care if y'all don't like

08:43.280 --> 08:44.280
me.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.000
The larger community and the movement seems to agree that you do not belong in your position

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
anymore.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.580
With this in mind, why aren't you stepping down?

08:49.580 --> 08:52.600
If your interest really was in the movement, then you'd step aside and let other people

08:52.600 --> 08:53.600
lead for a while.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.800
You can't be so ignorant to not realize that when a movement has a poor leadership,

08:56.800 --> 08:57.800
it's doomed to fail.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.560
We're all trying to let you know that you aren't a good leader.

08:59.560 --> 09:02.280
So if you really actually cared about the movement, and if you really aren't as thick

09:02.280 --> 09:04.560
as people say you are, then why would you not step down?

09:04.560 --> 09:07.240
I mean, please, for all of our sake, take your ego out of the equation.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.720
I get you're probably feeling bad because you're getting a lot of hate, but try to

09:09.720 --> 09:10.720
be objective.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.560
Try to take a step back and realize that this is bigger than you.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.920
You don't want to be the reason the movement tanked.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.640
My ego isn't controlling me.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.760
Y'all are being ridiculous and there has been no vote about whether or not I'm going

09:19.760 --> 09:20.760
to be a mod.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.280
And even if there was, I wouldn't care.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.800
Mids aren't democratically elected and this isn't a democracy.

09:24.800 --> 09:28.560
We may strive for as much user input as possible in certain circumstances, but I'm not going

09:28.560 --> 09:31.920
to apologize or resign for a situation that was tainted from the beginning.

09:31.920 --> 09:36.200
Now, Abolish Work is an anarchist, I think an anarcho-communist specifically.

09:36.200 --> 09:40.960
This is somebody who follows a philosophy of explicit anti-hierarchy and communitarianism.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.800
But now that they've got just a single drop of power, literally a drop, it's a fucking

09:44.800 --> 09:48.920
reddit moderator position, they're out here spouting shit like this isn't a democracy

09:48.920 --> 09:52.360
and I'm not going to resign just because it's popular for me to do so.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.780
I said it in a previous video and I'll say it again.

09:54.780 --> 09:56.920
There are no anarchists.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.740
Anarchism is a philosophy that is fucking stupid.

09:58.740 --> 10:01.480
There are people who larp as anarchists as a means to an end.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.740
They want the slate wiped clean, not to abolish hierarchy, but so that they may build new

10:05.740 --> 10:08.420
hierarchy with them at the top unimpeded.

10:08.420 --> 10:11.560
That accurately describes every single anarchist out there.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.560
Without exception.

10:12.560 --> 10:13.560
I trust none of these fuckers.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.560
Revolution!

10:15.560 --> 10:20.560
The big helmeted Pakleds will no longer control us.

10:20.560 --> 10:21.560
Ooh.

10:21.560 --> 10:25.560
I am now Pakled leader.

10:25.560 --> 10:26.560
Behold!

10:26.560 --> 10:28.560
My giant helmet!

10:28.560 --> 10:32.840
Eventually, as the mods of the subreddit finally solidified their stance and united in opposition

10:32.840 --> 10:35.960
to their own user base, the user revolt came to a head with this post.

10:35.960 --> 10:36.960
Sorry, doesn't cut it.

10:36.960 --> 10:37.960
You have no power here.

10:37.960 --> 10:41.600
You can modify comments, you can delete comments, you can delete threads, and that is the extent

10:41.600 --> 10:43.280
of the power that you hold as a mod.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.480
This is not to attack you, but it is to remind you that you should have no influence over

10:46.480 --> 10:49.880
the sub, and if you are having influence over the sub, then there is something immensely

10:49.880 --> 10:50.880
wrong.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.880
I can't believe how painfully ironic it is that you have some authority and you've

10:53.880 --> 10:57.040
exerted it incorrectly and then immediately refuse to acknowledge it or correct it on

10:57.040 --> 11:01.500
this sub which is literally dedicated to holding those who do exactly what you did accountable.

11:01.500 --> 11:04.160
How can you possibly be blind to this painful irony?

11:04.160 --> 11:05.720
Well, because they're anarchists.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.720
I think I've said this in ten fucking videos at this point.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.280
There are no libertarian socialists.

11:11.280 --> 11:13.300
There are only tankies in waiting.

11:13.300 --> 11:17.320
The mods banned every single person who criticized Abolish Work, who criticized the mods handling

11:17.320 --> 11:21.360
of the revolt, and who posted it in the anti-work drama thread on cringetopia.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.360
They basically went scorched earth with this shit.

11:23.360 --> 11:27.180
Eventually the sub was fully closed and most of the users migrated over to r slash work

11:27.180 --> 11:30.680
reform where they continued their communist larping and dreaming while people who just

11:30.680 --> 11:33.760
wanted funny I quit stories to have been left out to dry.

11:33.760 --> 11:38.100
As of this morning, the anti-work sub is actually back, but the same mod team is still in charge

11:38.100 --> 11:39.960
and they're still being pretty heavy handed.

11:39.960 --> 11:40.960
It's dead Jim.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.640
That's not spicy enough of an ending to this story, is it?

11:43.640 --> 11:47.980
Surely I've found something else that puts a nice little bow on all of this.

11:47.980 --> 11:51.200
This is from Abolish Work's Facebook account.

11:51.200 --> 11:59.480
The person accusing me of serial rape and I were involved in sexual conduct.

11:59.480 --> 12:04.040
This scenario involved alcohol on their part, but I had been informed multiple times that

12:04.040 --> 12:05.200
it wasn't a big deal.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.640
They said they were only tipsy and that they were consenting to what was happening.

12:08.640 --> 12:12.320
I took them at their word and I will be more responsible in the future when it comes to

12:12.320 --> 12:13.480
alcohol and sex.

12:13.480 --> 12:17.920
I'm unaware of who I've allegedly raped besides the person making the accusation.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.500
The only other person I can think of is a previous partner.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.240
I take consent very seriously.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.680
And here's that other story.

12:23.680 --> 12:27.920
I wrote this a long while ago in case this situation ever happened and sadly here it

12:27.920 --> 12:28.920
is.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.500
I strive to be open and honest.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.780
Those who are close to me can verify that I exude those qualities more than any other.

12:34.780 --> 12:38.520
It's in that spirit that I make public certain past events within my life.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.520
I want to discuss a history I have with someone that I used to know.

12:41.520 --> 12:45.320
This was a person with whom I had an ongoing sexual relationship and living arrangement.

12:45.320 --> 12:49.980
Eventually, a mix of fundamentally incompatible needs, past trauma unrelated to me, and my

12:49.980 --> 12:54.200
issues with impulsive control resulted in a very unhealthy dynamic between us.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.940
Due to my dislike of call-out culture, this person will remain anonymous.

12:57.940 --> 13:02.640
This individual had past trauma from previous relationships that caused emotional and physical

13:02.640 --> 13:04.880
distance between us over the course of months.

13:04.880 --> 13:11.540
This led to my needs going unmet, which led to masturbation as an unhealthy coping mechanism.

13:11.540 --> 13:16.440
After months of trying to keep myself in check, I began sporadically masturbating while they

13:16.440 --> 13:17.980
slept next to me.

13:17.980 --> 13:22.020
Even though they stated this made them feel uncomfortable, these events continued to happen

13:22.020 --> 13:23.720
until I sought help through therapy.

13:23.720 --> 13:28.400
I had woken up one morning with them laying next to me and remembering they felt uncomfortable

13:28.400 --> 13:30.980
with me masturbating next to them while they slept.

13:30.980 --> 13:34.040
I placed their hand over my boxers.

13:34.040 --> 13:37.760
They moved their hand away and I thought nothing at what happened and fell back asleep.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.920
They later woke up and mentioned to me that they had a nightmare involving these series

13:40.920 --> 13:41.920
of events.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.680
I admitted that it had happened, apologized, and explained that I was half asleep and not

13:45.680 --> 13:47.880
in full control of my actions.

13:47.880 --> 13:52.560
Lastly, the previously mentioned coping mechanism resulted in this person creating alarms for

13:52.560 --> 13:59.180
us so we wouldn't fall asleep together and thus boundary violations would be minimized.

13:59.180 --> 14:04.300
Much to my retrospective disgust, my desperation for emotional intimacy led me to shut off

14:04.300 --> 14:06.740
the alarms at various points.

14:06.740 --> 14:10.060
When I learned how much this harmed this person, I soon went to therapy.

14:10.060 --> 14:13.380
Thereafter I was better able to cope with my impulsive tendencies and thus consistently

14:13.380 --> 14:14.860
respect their boundaries.

14:14.860 --> 14:18.340
Resulting from my remorse, I made a financial contribution to an organization dedicated

14:18.340 --> 14:21.140
to helping people in alternative but abusive relationships.

14:21.140 --> 14:25.060
There was discussion between me and this individual of helping with therapy costs, however given

14:25.060 --> 14:28.200
my economic status and their insurance coverage, we decided against it.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.040
As well, I've used that unhealthy dynamic as a way to improve myself, my relationships

14:32.040 --> 14:34.360
since then have been healthy and mutually beneficial.

14:34.360 --> 14:38.800
These events have led me to suffer several symptoms of PTSD, sporadic suicidal ideation

14:38.800 --> 14:39.800
and self-esteem loss.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.920
I've done my best to heal by privately talking to multiple friends about this, but I think

14:42.920 --> 14:43.920
I need to do more than that.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.500
Throughout my life, I have striven to be a respectful and compassionate person.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.480
That means that when others are too good about their boundaries, I want to be sensitive to

14:48.480 --> 14:49.480
them and respectful of them.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.440
And if I discover after the fact that I violated somebody's boundaries and want to apologize

14:52.440 --> 14:54.360
and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

14:54.360 --> 14:57.220
I am embarrassed and regretful that even after learning how much it harmed them, I

14:57.220 --> 14:58.400
still engage in it after the fact.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.600
I don't know what coming forward with this information will do, but I hope everyone can

15:01.600 --> 15:04.540
still trust me to do what is right and hold myself responsible and accountable when I

15:04.540 --> 15:05.540
make mistakes.

15:05.540 --> 15:08.940
The only comments I'll be accepting on this thread are clarifying questions and constructive

15:08.940 --> 15:11.260
criticisms that are coming from a good and supportive place.

15:11.260 --> 15:16.160
Shaming me in an attempt to show that my actions were wrong is both unproductive and unnecessary

15:16.160 --> 15:18.740
as I am well aware of my actions and their lack of morality.

15:18.740 --> 15:30.500
I know I shouldn't be laughing, it's sexual assault, but my god, you're presenting this

15:30.500 --> 15:34.860
like you're the victim of the sexual assault, but you're the fucking perpetrator.

15:34.860 --> 15:35.940
Read this garbage again.

15:35.940 --> 15:39.020
Due to my dislike of call out culture, this person will remain anonymous.

15:39.020 --> 15:44.220
You're the one who needs to be called out, even by the cancel culture brigade.

15:44.220 --> 15:46.260
You're the one who's in the wrong here, not the victim.

15:46.260 --> 15:47.260
Jesus Christ.

15:47.260 --> 15:51.460
So this person, this person who went on Fox News and single handedly destroyed a movement,

15:51.460 --> 15:55.620
they would lie next to somebody and masturbate, and then grab their arm and move their hand

15:55.620 --> 15:59.320
over their dick, even as they were told to stop repeatedly.

15:59.320 --> 16:02.940
And when this other person started setting alarms so that they wouldn't be asleep at

16:02.940 --> 16:07.260
the same time, you would shut the alarms off and then go back to masturbating.

16:07.260 --> 16:10.380
Jesus fucking Christ, oh my god.

16:10.380 --> 16:14.260
The boat has finally sunk and it's still somehow on fire.

16:14.260 --> 16:19.520
Why is it always, always, always, always, always a leftoid sex pest behind this shit

16:19.520 --> 16:21.700
any time something like this happens?

16:21.700 --> 16:24.440
This is what happens every single fucking time.

16:24.440 --> 16:27.660
You have these people who are larping about being communist revolutionaries, they want

16:27.660 --> 16:30.820
to overthrow capitalism, they want to seize the means of production, and yet all they

16:30.820 --> 16:34.740
do is infight because it turns out that they're all just scum fucks, and as soon as one of

16:34.740 --> 16:38.480
them is actually publicly revealed as a scum fuck, they all turn on each other.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.940
Because there are no actual virtuous actors within this movement.

16:41.940 --> 16:42.940
But you know what?

16:42.940 --> 16:43.940
I've solved the mystery.

16:43.940 --> 16:48.540
The only reason behind why the mods of r slash anti work closed the subreddit is that modding

16:48.540 --> 16:50.580
the community was just too much work.
