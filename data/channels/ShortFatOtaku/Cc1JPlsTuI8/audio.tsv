0	9320	Alright, usually I don't do such a blatant sequel to a previous video, but this time
9320	10600	it's really, really worth it.
10600	14160	About a month ago I put out a video about the subreddit r slash anti work.
14160	17480	Anti work began as a community where people would post text conversations between them
17480	18840	and their shitty bosses.
18840	22420	The bosses would always demand something amazingly stupid from the OP.
22420	26100	The OP has enough and decides to quit over text, leaving the boss high and dry.
26100	30060	It was a cathartic sub, where you got to see stuff like people's rightfully earned and
30060	34260	properly scheduled vacations cancelled last minute to cover up a manager's mistake,
34260	37240	and then when the manager tries to force the worker to shut up and do as they're told,
37240	39540	the worker walks leaving the manager holding the bag.
39540	42220	Everyone's had a shit boss before, we all have felt this way.
42220	46940	However, after the community went viral, it rapidly got co-opted by communists, who loudly
46940	50940	proclaimed that anti work was always communist oriented, and that the sub was not a repository
50940	56100	for funny I quit fuck you boss stories, but instead existed to agitate for anti capitalist
56100	57300	political action.
57300	61480	And yes, this is unfortunately what anti work morphed into over time.
61480	62940	It's just so stupid.
62940	67320	Quitting your job and finding a better one isn't socialist praxis, it's liberal capitalism
67320	68380	working as intended.
68380	72300	You make an agreement with your boss to do X job for Y hours for Z pay.
72300	75400	If you can't come to an agreement that you're both satisfied with, then you walk.
75400	78300	That's exactly what the workers did, they walked, they exercised their rights.
78300	82020	Just as your employer exercises their rights when they fire you, if you're not upholding
82020	83900	your end of the agreement, either.
83900	85940	Capitalism is an inherently adversarial system.
85940	86940	That's a feature of it.
86940	87940	It's a good thing.
87940	91300	Boss and worker represent two opposing camps, each pulling in their own direction and a
91300	92780	compromise is struck in the middle.
92780	94740	If it can't be struck, then there's no deal.
94740	96740	This is all how it's supposed to work.
96740	101000	Well, the reason I'm talking about this again, is because a mod of anti work was invited
101000	104140	onto Fox News to describe the sub and the movement.
104140	105140	You've got to see this shit.
105140	108780	Joining me now is the person who operates this anti work group.
108780	111580	Oh my God, it really is your average Reddit.
111580	112580	They do it for free moderator.
112580	114780	You don't think you could have showered before coming on?
114780	123140	All right, so Doreen, why do you like the idea of being home, not working, but still
123140	126780	getting paid by corporate America?
126780	131020	Yeah, so there's a misconceptions about the movement.
131020	136460	So we're a movement where we want to reduce the amount of work that people feel like they
136460	137780	they're forced to do.
137780	140360	Dude, look at the smirk on the host's face.
140360	142220	He's like, am I literally talking to a teenager?
142220	144180	He doesn't want to get a summer job.
144180	146420	And so we want to still put in effort.
146420	152460	We want to put in labor, but we don't want to necessarily be in a position where we feel
152460	153460	trapped.
153460	156820	You know, you just quoted from office space where that person feels very trapped in their
156820	157820	job.
157820	162260	And I think we're calling for a society where there's less of that.
162260	163260	But yeah, absolutely.
163260	165220	People still want to do things.
165220	169560	They just want to do things where they feel rewarded and they feel like they're in a good
169560	174460	spot in their life and that their job respects them and stuff like that.
174460	175820	That's all pretty reasonable.
175820	177860	That's why you quit jobs and move on again.
177860	178860	Working as intended.
178860	180020	You know, there's varying.
180020	183700	So you're so Doreen, you're not being forced to work.
183700	186180	This isn't this isn't slave labor.
186180	188500	You've applied for a job.
188500	192820	You've agreed to the terms and conditions of the employment.
192820	196860	And you know, you can walk away from that job at any time and quit.
196860	202220	So I don't understand really what this is about, except it sounds like maybe people
202220	203860	are just being lazy.
203860	207380	Are you encouraging people to be lazy?
207380	214020	So I think laziness is a virtue in a society where people constantly want you to be productive
214020	215020	24 seven.
215020	216020	Yes.
216020	218380	Yes, I can tell that you think laziness is a virtue.
218380	219380	Jesus Christ.
219380	221660	And it's good to have rest.
221660	225400	That doesn't mean you should be resting all the time or not putting effort into things
225400	226400	that you care about.
226400	229100	But I think one of the issues is like a good work day.
229100	233540	How many hours is, you know, a solid work day in your ideal society?
233540	234540	Sure.
234540	239800	I mean, I think as much as people want, I mean, I personally work I have I have like
239800	243920	a 20, 25 hour work weeks, which I think is fairly good.
243920	245960	So I would like less work hours.
245960	248360	And what do you do, Doreen?
248360	249600	I'm a dog walker.
249600	250600	A dog walker.
250600	251600	Okay.
251600	252600	Yes.
252600	253600	Oh, God.
253600	254600	I just realized this person's trans.
254600	255600	Doreen.
255600	256600	Yep.
256600	257600	Fuck.
257600	259720	Well, I guess the dog walker thing makes sense now.
259720	262880	Ever since I've made that fucking video, I've been surrounded by dog pills, guys.
262880	265100	I see them everywhere I go.
265100	266100	And how?
266100	267100	Yeah.
267100	268100	So how old are you?
268100	269100	If you don't mind me asking.
269100	270100	Sure.
270100	271100	I'm 30.
271100	272100	You're 30.
272100	273100	Okay.
273100	274100	I'm 30.
274100	275100	Fuck.
275100	278180	I know I get flack for streaming video games and making YouTube videos for my money, but
278180	279180	shit.
279180	283580	And is there something you want to do besides being a dog walker, do you aspire to do anything
283580	284580	more than dog walking?
284580	288360	Or is that kind of your your pinnacle?
288360	290280	I love working with dogs.
290280	293420	If I had to do this for the rest of my life, you know, I wouldn't be super complaining.
293420	297080	You know, dogs are wonderful animals, but I mean, I would love to teach.
297080	302140	I would love to Oh, God, look at the face of the host.
302180	303500	He knows what's going on here.
303500	306380	You know, work with work with people and stuff like that.
306380	309380	What would you teach Doreen?
309380	314420	A philosophy mostly philosophy, philosophy, critical thinking reasons, stuff like that.
314420	315420	Okay.
315420	318380	Well, I would love to take your class Doreen.
318380	321540	I would just be taking notes the whole time.
321540	328460	And you know what, a professor is a very similar schedule than something that you're imagining.
328460	331380	So I think that actually might might work perfectly for you.
331700	335620	I think this might not be the greatest idea, but who am I to judge?
335620	337660	To each their own, they say.
337660	339660	It's a free country.
339660	340660	Sure.
340660	341700	Not everything's free.
341700	343460	But it is a free country.
343460	344460	Thank you so much.
344460	345460	We got to run.
345460	346460	We got to pay the bills.
346460	347460	Holy fuck.
347460	352240	I know this wasn't an online debate, but Doreen here sure got dumpster like this was the primetime
352240	354420	morning kumite internet bloodsports.
354420	357640	Like the Fox News guy was only asking surface level stuff.
357640	359540	It was all softball questions.
359540	361580	And the anti work mod just fumbled it.
361580	364900	All you have to do is say something like we believe the workers showing the means of production.
364900	367100	I mean, these people say that shit constantly everywhere else.
367100	368100	What happened?
368100	369100	Your commies own it.
369100	373560	Instead, Doreen walked into an obvious bait and switch where the Fox News host successfully
373560	378180	made the entire movement look like lazy layabouts and bums because on at least some level that's
378180	379260	what they are.
379260	382320	And the rest of the movement was not happy about it.
382320	387100	The video was posted to r slash anti work where Doreen, the interviewed mod responded
387100	391340	under the name of abolish work and oh boy was that video considered a dumpster fire
391340	392940	by everybody.
392940	395780	Abolish work said that they're autistic, which is why they kept fidgeting and refusing to
395780	396780	look at the camera.
396780	400240	Another user asked, did you share the offer for an interview with the other mods beforehand?
400240	403380	Did you all decide you were the best person to represent this sub on Fox?
403380	406940	If so, that might have been slightly misguided and abolish work replied with the interview
406940	410580	offer was given to the mods via mod mail and they specifically asked for me.
410580	413580	I shared that with the other mods and they all agreed that I was probably the best to
413580	414900	do it because I've done other media.
414900	416940	Yeah, that was a big fat whoops.
416940	420240	Last interview, abolish work turned into a lightning rod for everything wrong with the
420240	424460	anti work movement and the entire sub decided that they were public enemy number one.
424460	427940	This whole debacle can be summed up with something we've known for a very long time.
427940	429640	Moderators are losers.
429640	433180	The sub is imploding before our very eyes exactly what Fox wanted.
433180	434700	The mod got softball questions.
434700	435940	I can't even blame Fox.
435940	437700	Who's the mad lad that stickied this thread?
437700	438960	The girls are infighting.
438960	442580	The mega thread they created to corral the storm was locked and unpinned inside of 30
442580	443580	minutes.
443580	444580	Is their mod infighting?
444580	445680	And the answer to that is yes.
445680	449680	The mod team of r slash anti work began actually ripping into each other with some wanting
449680	453100	to bury everything and cover it up and others venting their disappointment and wanting the
453100	457320	community to be able to do the same because of abolish works status as a trans woman.
457320	460820	It rapidly became the party line that critiquing their interview performance was transphobic
460820	462580	off topic and brigading the sub.
462580	466640	The users continued to complain and the mods labeled them all bad actors just like any
466640	470420	other power tripping modern isolated small community online that blows up.
470420	471920	It's a tale as old as time.
471920	473880	In fact, a tale far older than the internet.
473880	477320	Here's a private conversation between abolish work and some of the sub's users.
477320	478320	Step down.
478320	479320	We don't want you.
479320	480320	We don't like you.
480320	481320	It's not because you're trans.
481320	482320	I'm an ally.
482320	483320	I respect your identity.
483320	484320	But I don't respect your behavior since the interview.
484320	486360	I don't respect how you've made a laughing stock out of us.
486360	489320	I don't respect how you've failed to communicate any of the philosophies you represent.
489320	491560	You made a mistake big enough that you need to step down.
491560	492560	Not gonna happen.
492560	495400	Your actions are fully admitting that you care more about your status as a mod than
495400	496880	you do the community you moderate.
496880	497880	We don't like you.
497880	498880	We don't want you.
498880	499880	Step down.
499880	500880	I'm not in this to be liked.
500880	502520	If I was I wouldn't be doing politics lol.
502520	503520	Then what are you in this for?
504160	506920	Because it's clearly not in the interest of the community for you to remain a mod.
506920	509760	So if you were in it because of the movement, you'd step down, right?
509760	511960	What is the reason you're being so thick headed about this?
511960	512960	And don't delude yourself.
512960	513960	You're not doing politics.
513960	515840	You're the mod of a subreddit and a dog walker.
515840	518020	I'm the mod of a political subreddit lol.
518020	520660	We literally gave a ton of aid to the Kellogg strikers.
520660	523280	So yeah, it's a political movement, and I don't really care if y'all don't like
523280	524280	me.
524280	527000	The larger community and the movement seems to agree that you do not belong in your position
527000	528000	anymore.
528000	529580	With this in mind, why aren't you stepping down?
529580	532600	If your interest really was in the movement, then you'd step aside and let other people
532600	533600	lead for a while.
533600	536800	You can't be so ignorant to not realize that when a movement has a poor leadership,
536800	537800	it's doomed to fail.
537800	539560	We're all trying to let you know that you aren't a good leader.
539560	542280	So if you really actually cared about the movement, and if you really aren't as thick
542280	544560	as people say you are, then why would you not step down?
544560	547240	I mean, please, for all of our sake, take your ego out of the equation.
547240	549720	I get you're probably feeling bad because you're getting a lot of hate, but try to
549720	550720	be objective.
550720	552560	Try to take a step back and realize that this is bigger than you.
552560	554920	You don't want to be the reason the movement tanked.
554920	556640	My ego isn't controlling me.
556640	559760	Y'all are being ridiculous and there has been no vote about whether or not I'm going
559760	560760	to be a mod.
560760	562280	And even if there was, I wouldn't care.
562280	564800	Mids aren't democratically elected and this isn't a democracy.
564800	568560	We may strive for as much user input as possible in certain circumstances, but I'm not going
568560	571920	to apologize or resign for a situation that was tainted from the beginning.
571920	576200	Now, Abolish Work is an anarchist, I think an anarcho-communist specifically.
576200	580960	This is somebody who follows a philosophy of explicit anti-hierarchy and communitarianism.
580960	584800	But now that they've got just a single drop of power, literally a drop, it's a fucking
584800	588920	reddit moderator position, they're out here spouting shit like this isn't a democracy
588920	592360	and I'm not going to resign just because it's popular for me to do so.
592360	594780	I said it in a previous video and I'll say it again.
594780	596920	There are no anarchists.
596920	598740	Anarchism is a philosophy that is fucking stupid.
598740	601480	There are people who larp as anarchists as a means to an end.
601480	605740	They want the slate wiped clean, not to abolish hierarchy, but so that they may build new
605740	608420	hierarchy with them at the top unimpeded.
608420	611560	That accurately describes every single anarchist out there.
611560	612560	Without exception.
612560	613560	I trust none of these fuckers.
613560	614560	Revolution!
615560	620560	The big helmeted Pakleds will no longer control us.
620560	621560	Ooh.
621560	625560	I am now Pakled leader.
625560	626560	Behold!
626560	628560	My giant helmet!
628560	632840	Eventually, as the mods of the subreddit finally solidified their stance and united in opposition
632840	635960	to their own user base, the user revolt came to a head with this post.
635960	636960	Sorry, doesn't cut it.
636960	637960	You have no power here.
637960	641600	You can modify comments, you can delete comments, you can delete threads, and that is the extent
641600	643280	of the power that you hold as a mod.
643280	646480	This is not to attack you, but it is to remind you that you should have no influence over
646480	649880	the sub, and if you are having influence over the sub, then there is something immensely
649880	650880	wrong.
650880	653880	I can't believe how painfully ironic it is that you have some authority and you've
653880	657040	exerted it incorrectly and then immediately refuse to acknowledge it or correct it on
657040	661500	this sub which is literally dedicated to holding those who do exactly what you did accountable.
661500	664160	How can you possibly be blind to this painful irony?
664160	665720	Well, because they're anarchists.
665720	668720	I think I've said this in ten fucking videos at this point.
668720	671280	There are no libertarian socialists.
671280	673300	There are only tankies in waiting.
673300	677320	The mods banned every single person who criticized Abolish Work, who criticized the mods handling
677320	681360	of the revolt, and who posted it in the anti-work drama thread on cringetopia.
681360	683360	They basically went scorched earth with this shit.
683360	687180	Eventually the sub was fully closed and most of the users migrated over to r slash work
687180	690680	reform where they continued their communist larping and dreaming while people who just
690680	693760	wanted funny I quit stories to have been left out to dry.
693760	698100	As of this morning, the anti-work sub is actually back, but the same mod team is still in charge
698100	699960	and they're still being pretty heavy handed.
699960	700960	It's dead Jim.
701640	703640	That's not spicy enough of an ending to this story, is it?
703640	707980	Surely I've found something else that puts a nice little bow on all of this.
707980	711200	This is from Abolish Work's Facebook account.
711200	719480	The person accusing me of serial rape and I were involved in sexual conduct.
719480	724040	This scenario involved alcohol on their part, but I had been informed multiple times that
724040	725200	it wasn't a big deal.
725200	728640	They said they were only tipsy and that they were consenting to what was happening.
728640	732320	I took them at their word and I will be more responsible in the future when it comes to
732320	733480	alcohol and sex.
733480	737920	I'm unaware of who I've allegedly raped besides the person making the accusation.
737920	740500	The only other person I can think of is a previous partner.
740500	742240	I take consent very seriously.
742240	743680	And here's that other story.
743680	747920	I wrote this a long while ago in case this situation ever happened and sadly here it
747920	748920	is.
748920	750500	I strive to be open and honest.
750500	754780	Those who are close to me can verify that I exude those qualities more than any other.
754780	758520	It's in that spirit that I make public certain past events within my life.
758520	761520	I want to discuss a history I have with someone that I used to know.
761520	765320	This was a person with whom I had an ongoing sexual relationship and living arrangement.
765320	769980	Eventually, a mix of fundamentally incompatible needs, past trauma unrelated to me, and my
769980	774200	issues with impulsive control resulted in a very unhealthy dynamic between us.
774200	777940	Due to my dislike of call-out culture, this person will remain anonymous.
777940	782640	This individual had past trauma from previous relationships that caused emotional and physical
782640	784880	distance between us over the course of months.
784880	791540	This led to my needs going unmet, which led to masturbation as an unhealthy coping mechanism.
791540	796440	After months of trying to keep myself in check, I began sporadically masturbating while they
796440	797980	slept next to me.
797980	802020	Even though they stated this made them feel uncomfortable, these events continued to happen
802020	803720	until I sought help through therapy.
803720	808400	I had woken up one morning with them laying next to me and remembering they felt uncomfortable
808400	810980	with me masturbating next to them while they slept.
810980	814040	I placed their hand over my boxers.
814040	817760	They moved their hand away and I thought nothing at what happened and fell back asleep.
817760	820920	They later woke up and mentioned to me that they had a nightmare involving these series
820920	821920	of events.
821920	825680	I admitted that it had happened, apologized, and explained that I was half asleep and not
825680	827880	in full control of my actions.
827880	832560	Lastly, the previously mentioned coping mechanism resulted in this person creating alarms for
832560	839180	us so we wouldn't fall asleep together and thus boundary violations would be minimized.
839180	844300	Much to my retrospective disgust, my desperation for emotional intimacy led me to shut off
844300	846740	the alarms at various points.
846740	850060	When I learned how much this harmed this person, I soon went to therapy.
850060	853380	Thereafter I was better able to cope with my impulsive tendencies and thus consistently
853380	854860	respect their boundaries.
854860	858340	Resulting from my remorse, I made a financial contribution to an organization dedicated
858340	861140	to helping people in alternative but abusive relationships.
861140	865060	There was discussion between me and this individual of helping with therapy costs, however given
865060	868200	my economic status and their insurance coverage, we decided against it.
868240	872040	As well, I've used that unhealthy dynamic as a way to improve myself, my relationships
872040	874360	since then have been healthy and mutually beneficial.
874360	878800	These events have led me to suffer several symptoms of PTSD, sporadic suicidal ideation
878800	879800	and self-esteem loss.
879800	882920	I've done my best to heal by privately talking to multiple friends about this, but I think
882920	883920	I need to do more than that.
883920	886500	Throughout my life, I have striven to be a respectful and compassionate person.
886500	888480	That means that when others are too good about their boundaries, I want to be sensitive to
888480	889480	them and respectful of them.
889480	892440	And if I discover after the fact that I violated somebody's boundaries and want to apologize
892440	894360	and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
894360	897220	I am embarrassed and regretful that even after learning how much it harmed them, I
897220	898400	still engage in it after the fact.
898400	901600	I don't know what coming forward with this information will do, but I hope everyone can
901600	904540	still trust me to do what is right and hold myself responsible and accountable when I
904540	905540	make mistakes.
905540	908940	The only comments I'll be accepting on this thread are clarifying questions and constructive
908940	911260	criticisms that are coming from a good and supportive place.
911260	916160	Shaming me in an attempt to show that my actions were wrong is both unproductive and unnecessary
916160	918740	as I am well aware of my actions and their lack of morality.
918740	930500	I know I shouldn't be laughing, it's sexual assault, but my god, you're presenting this
930500	934860	like you're the victim of the sexual assault, but you're the fucking perpetrator.
934860	935940	Read this garbage again.
935940	939020	Due to my dislike of call out culture, this person will remain anonymous.
939020	944220	You're the one who needs to be called out, even by the cancel culture brigade.
944220	946260	You're the one who's in the wrong here, not the victim.
946260	947260	Jesus Christ.
947260	951460	So this person, this person who went on Fox News and single handedly destroyed a movement,
951460	955620	they would lie next to somebody and masturbate, and then grab their arm and move their hand
955620	959320	over their dick, even as they were told to stop repeatedly.
959320	962940	And when this other person started setting alarms so that they wouldn't be asleep at
962940	967260	the same time, you would shut the alarms off and then go back to masturbating.
967260	970380	Jesus fucking Christ, oh my god.
970380	974260	The boat has finally sunk and it's still somehow on fire.
974260	979520	Why is it always, always, always, always, always a leftoid sex pest behind this shit
979520	981700	any time something like this happens?
981700	984440	This is what happens every single fucking time.
984440	987660	You have these people who are larping about being communist revolutionaries, they want
987660	990820	to overthrow capitalism, they want to seize the means of production, and yet all they
990820	994740	do is infight because it turns out that they're all just scum fucks, and as soon as one of
994740	998480	them is actually publicly revealed as a scum fuck, they all turn on each other.
998480	1001940	Because there are no actual virtuous actors within this movement.
1001940	1002940	But you know what?
1002940	1003940	I've solved the mystery.
1003940	1008540	The only reason behind why the mods of r slash anti work closed the subreddit is that modding
1008540	1010580	the community was just too much work.
