00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
Hello, my friends. I hope you're having a wonderful day. Today, I would like to take

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,800
a moment to talk about a phenomenon that I like to call wishful thinking after the revolution.

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,320
And examining this idea shows us exactly what kind of people we're dealing with when we

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,960
talk about, very broadly, leftist revolutionaries. This is the earliest instance I can find of

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,860
this phenomenon. This is from 2017 on Twitter. Y'all ever think about what your roles will

6
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:37,980
be post-revolution? The first person, Groucho Marx, says, I hope to be a therapist, maybe

7
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,240
for general trauma, but maybe re-educating the antisocial tendencies out of people in

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,200
a gulag. Quest Riggs says, this is a great thread. Red Army or the party if they'd take

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:57,140
me. If not, communal farming. JL Hamilton says, logistics for the new Red Army, uniform

10
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,120
design and equipment procurement. Now, the first level analysis of this is that all of

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,880
these people are simply delusional. They think they would actually be allowed to control

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,400
their own destinies in some individualistic manner after a socialist or communist or anarchist

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,820
or whatever revolution. Even if they support those politics and supported that revolution,

14
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,700
we all know that there is no way they would simply be allowed to do whatever they want.

15
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,340
In fact, that's why there are so many memes of communist soldiers saying, that's amusing,

16
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,860
please face the wall now. These people are the useful idiots that Yuri Bezmenov described,

17
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,500
the ones that ideologically truly believe in socialism. And yet, after the power structure

18
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:41,240
that protects them, namely liberal democracy, is destroyed, the true revolutionaries have

19
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,500
no more use for them, so they are lined up and shot. So it's very easy on a surface level

20
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,820
to just look at this and laugh at these people for not understanding the nature of politics

21
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:55,200
or power and for being true believers in an absolutely horrible ideology. But that's only

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,840
a surface level critique of this stuff. For example, look at Groucho Marx's reply again.

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,100
She wants to be re-educating antisocial tendencies out of people in a gulag. So in a nonpolitical

24
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,600
sense, antisocial personality disorder is sociopathy. It's a mental disorder in which

25
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,040
a person consistently shows no regard for right or wrong and ignores the rights and

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,160
feelings of others. They tend to antagonize, manipulate or treat others harshly or with

27
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,760
callous indifference. They show no guilt or remorse for their behavior. But this is not

28
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,240
the socialist or anarchist view of antisocial. In a more casual sense, antisocial has come

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,180
to mean not interested in social activities. You know, you want to stay inside and play

30
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,880
video games all day instead of playing with your friends as a kid. That's an antisocial

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,680
activity. In the political sense, on the left, there is this idea, and yes, I've gone over

32
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,600
it a dozen times before on this channel. It's from Marx's On the Jewish Question,

33
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,520
of anti-individualism as a virtue. I do need to explain this, but I also don't want to

34
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,240
beat a dead horse completely. We've gone over this many times on this channel. So just

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,240
very quickly, in On the Jewish Question, Karl Marx critiques the liberal idea of individualism.

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,420
And there's a long passage on this, but I'll just read a short little bit of it. Liberty

37
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,580
is the right to do everything which does not harm others. The limits within each individual

38
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,240
can act without harming others are determined by law, just as the boundary between two fields

39
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,440
is marked by a stake. It is a question of the liberty of man regarded as an isolated

40
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,920
monad, withdrawn into himself. But liberty as a right of man is not founded upon the

41
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,480
relations between man and man, but rather upon the separation of man from man. It is

42
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,920
the right of separation, the right of the circumscribed individual withdrawn into himself.

43
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,960
Marx's critique here is that liberalism enshrines the right of one individual to stand separate

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,040
and apart from other individuals. When, Marx argues, correctly I might add, that the true

45
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,200
meaning of life comes from not who we stand separate from, but who we have connections

46
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,600
with. And this is of course true. Look at your friends, look at your family, look at

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,960
your spouse. These are people that you're not standing separate from as a rugged individualist.

48
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,880
You have some emotional connection there. Marx's critique is that that emotional connection

49
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,480
is not enshrined as a right. And of course it shouldn't be, because these are voluntary

50
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,800
things. You should have the option to choose who you are closely connected with and who

51
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,600
you are strangers with. However, Marx did not agree. Marx believed that because you

52
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,000
have some kind of economic connection between, say, the person that you buy your food from,

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,120
that economic connection engenders a permanent social obligation and responsibility. Because

54
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,520
you've engaged in trade with this person, they now have a say in what you do and you

55
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,600
now have a say in what they do. And it's this interlocking web that creates a society. And

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,540
so if you are an individual separated, as Marx said, an isolated monad, that is an egoist

57
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,060
antisocial way for an individual to act within a society. And so the socialist prescription

58
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,380
is that has to be stopped. That's why you see a lot of people like this Groucho Marx

59
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,420
woman who says, re-educating antisocial tendencies out of people. That is the anti-individualism

60
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,100
within socialism. But despite being massively made fun of, this question keeps coming up.

61
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,780
What's your job in the leftist commune? I'm going to be leading discussion on theory some

62
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,780
days, making clothes from scraps in other days, and making lattes whenever needed. Oh

63
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,460
boy, that sounds great. Our glorious communist utopia. We're all living on the leftist commune.

64
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,820
Who's making the food? I don't know. I'm reading theory, making clothes from scraps and making

65
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,240
coffee. That's all I can do. That's the only skills that I have. What will be your position

66
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,980
after communism is achieved? Oh Jesus, look at the quote tweets. Holy shit. Missionary,

67
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,960
doggy. Man, so many of these quote tweets are laughing at these people. I think everyone

68
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,780
knows how stupid this is now. Look at the delusion here. I'm going to be a local bookish

69
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,820
person who fishes a few times a week, teaches loosely organized seminars on history and

70
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,300
philosophy, and spends a lot of time hanging out with her lover in the forest. Why would

71
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,700
you be allowed? It's the people's forest. Those are all the people's resources that

72
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,340
you're using. The collective interest comes before your bourgeois desire to hang out in

73
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,740
the forest and contribute nothing to society. Here's one who kind of has the basic idea

74
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,740
down at least. The dirty jobs that are necessary, fair enough. Getting under the buildings and

75
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,140
working on pipes, roof repairs, digging trenches for the many purposes of a trench. Maybe the

76
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,260
one that you'll end up in. Pretty much anything manual labor that is required to fulfill the

77
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,020
need of the community. I happily offer my contributions. You can do that now. You can

78
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,220
get those jobs right now. What are my special talents? Music, mathematics, and teaching

79
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,020
are some of my skills. Under communism, those skills will be harnessed for the benefit of

80
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,780
the collective. The new human will be built on the basis of the new community existing

81
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,600
inside the new international society. How is this any different than the fascist conception

82
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,860
of individuals working for the glory of the state? The only difference seems to be that

83
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,640
the state in this conception spans the entire world. These people's conception of what communism

84
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,280
looks like is just fascism that is universalized rather than being particular to one people

85
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,560
or one ethnic group. But it's ultimately the same system. What job are guys going to have

86
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,060
under communism? I'm thinking I'll be a hunter in the morning, a fisherman in the afternoon,

87
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:59,080
a herdsman in the evening, and a critic after dinner. Oh boy. This is actually also again

88
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,000
a quote of Marx's. This time from the German ideology. This is a book I haven't yet covered

89
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,400
on the channel. The division of labor implies the contradiction between the interest of

90
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,120
the separate individual or the individual family and the communal interest of all individuals

91
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,920
who have intercourse with one another. And indeed, this communal interest does not exist

92
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,420
merely in the imagination as the general interest, but first of all in reality as the mutual

93
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,460
interdependence of the individuals among whom the labor is divided. And finally, the division

94
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,760
of labor offers us the first example of how, as long as man remains in natural society

95
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,400
that is, as long as a cleavage exists between the particular and the common interest, as

96
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,760
long therefore as activity is not voluntarily but naturally divided, man's own deed becomes

97
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,100
an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him. This

98
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,880
section is partially reaffirming what was said in On the Jewish Question, where Marx

99
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,020
believes that this communal interest, this lasting bond between people who have casual

100
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,380
contact with each other, a bond that exerts some kind of control, some kind of right,

101
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,480
which is something that liberals don't believe. We believe in individualism. We believe in

102
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,720
separation between uninvolved parties. But that doesn't exist within the Marxist framework.

103
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,440
As soon as the distribution of labor comes into being, each man has a particular exclusive

104
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,080
sphere of activity which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter,

105
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,880
a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, whatever that means, and must remain so if

106
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,440
he does not want to lose his means of livelihood. While in a communist society, where nobody

107
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,320
has one exclusive sphere of activity, but each can become accomplished in any branch

108
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,440
he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one

109
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,720
thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear

110
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,420
cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming

111
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,880
a hunter, fisherman, herdsman, or critic. And that's the quote that this person is

112
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,960
appealing to. Of course, we all understand how stupid this is, right? You could be a

113
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,280
hunter in the morning, a fisherman in the afternoon, a herdsman in the evening, and

114
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,780
a critic after dinner, but then you would be shitty at all of them. I made this point

115
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,360
back during that video about the woman who worked at LinkedIn who had an extremely cushy

116
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,900
life. The reason that we have the society that we have is because of division of labor

117
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,420
and how the division of labor allowed people to become extremely specialized. A person

118
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,820
who only hunts in the morning will never be as good a hunter as somebody who hunts all

119
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,260
day every day. That difference between them will lead to a difference in output. The truly

120
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,380
amazing hunter who has practiced his craft his entire life will be the one who actually

121
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,620
brings home the bacon, not the person who lazily hunts in the morning and doesn't

122
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,020
really contribute anything. And in fact, that's why our society is what it is. Because people

123
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,200
have specialized and with that specialization comes high level skill. And with that high

124
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,440
level skill comes high quality and high quantity output. And this is the primary reason why

125
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,340
the question of what will you do after the revolution is not only jokey and stupid as

126
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,880
something that we can turn into memes and make fun of because it really is just brainless,

127
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,880
but it also shows how incredibly ignorant socialists actually are the destruction of

128
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,660
all barriers between everything as well as the destruction of standards, which is something

129
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,100
that the left definitely trends towards that also necessarily means the destruction of

130
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,780
the ability to become competent at a thing. So when Mark says that he'll be a hunter

131
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,980
in the morning, a fisherman in the afternoon, a herdsman in the evening and a critic after

132
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,440
dinner, that would be a truly hellish society if that's how everyone was behaving. Because

133
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,540
we need specialization. We need people doing the same jobs and becoming really good at

134
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,440
them. This is a system that just instantly falls apart because no one's actually producing

135
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,180
what is necessary to keep society running. You can't be a brain surgeon in the morning,

136
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:24,180
a mechanic of large machinery in the afternoon, an architect in the evening and then like

137
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,280
a high level chemist at night. Almost nobody can get good enough at all of these things.

138
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,980
They're just too complicated. Things are just too hard. These people genuinely believe there

139
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,460
will be no work within a communist system. They can all just laze around and enjoy the

140
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,860
fruits of somebody's labor. I don't know who's doing the work. This is why these people always

141
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,780
say such dumb shit like abolish work. They just don't know what's happening behind the

142
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,820
curtain to keep society running. So yeah, this after the revolution rhetoric, there's

143
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,360
really two ways to look at it. And the first way is that it's funny, it's memes. We can

144
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,420
laugh at how stupid these people are. They have no idea how anything works. And they

145
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:04,100
are young, dumb, entitled, bourgeois, champagne socialists. And the second way to look at

146
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,420
it is the underlying philosophy, which is not only anti liberal, but anti individual,

147
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,500
anti freedom, anti human flourishing. And no matter how much they talk about the utopia

148
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,780
or how free everyone will be or anything else like that. What lies beneath is this

149
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:22,940
deep desire to control other people in the name of the collective interest. These are

150
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:28,860
not good people. Best case scenario, they're delusional dumb kids who will grow up. However,

151
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,540
it's absolutely the case that some of these people, if given the chance, would be just

152
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,180
as fucking terrible as some of the worst monsters in history, if some other monster didn't get

153
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,540
to them first. But hey, the best thing we can do in either case is keep laughing. We've

154
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,180
seen many times humor is what disarms tyrants. Alright, I'm getting out of here. I'm sure

155
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,060
you can tell this video is kind of off the cuff. I don't have any of this written down.

156
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,580
I'm just kind of I'm just kind of spouting from the hip. I have to go and actually record

157
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,660
a scripted video now. I was just doing this one for fun. Okay, I'll see you next time,

158
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,660
guys. I love you.
