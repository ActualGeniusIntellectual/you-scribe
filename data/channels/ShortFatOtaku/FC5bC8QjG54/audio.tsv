0	9400	Hello, my friends. I hope you're having a wonderful day. Today, I would like to take
9400	15800	a moment to talk about a phenomenon that I like to call wishful thinking after the revolution.
15800	20320	And examining this idea shows us exactly what kind of people we're dealing with when we
20320	25960	talk about, very broadly, leftist revolutionaries. This is the earliest instance I can find of
25960	30860	this phenomenon. This is from 2017 on Twitter. Y'all ever think about what your roles will
30860	37980	be post-revolution? The first person, Groucho Marx, says, I hope to be a therapist, maybe
37980	44240	for general trauma, but maybe re-educating the antisocial tendencies out of people in
44240	50200	a gulag. Quest Riggs says, this is a great thread. Red Army or the party if they'd take
50200	57140	me. If not, communal farming. JL Hamilton says, logistics for the new Red Army, uniform
57140	62120	design and equipment procurement. Now, the first level analysis of this is that all of
62120	65880	these people are simply delusional. They think they would actually be allowed to control
65880	71400	their own destinies in some individualistic manner after a socialist or communist or anarchist
71400	76820	or whatever revolution. Even if they support those politics and supported that revolution,
76820	81700	we all know that there is no way they would simply be allowed to do whatever they want.
81700	86340	In fact, that's why there are so many memes of communist soldiers saying, that's amusing,
86340	91860	please face the wall now. These people are the useful idiots that Yuri Bezmenov described,
91860	96500	the ones that ideologically truly believe in socialism. And yet, after the power structure
96500	101240	that protects them, namely liberal democracy, is destroyed, the true revolutionaries have
101240	105500	no more use for them, so they are lined up and shot. So it's very easy on a surface level
105500	109820	to just look at this and laugh at these people for not understanding the nature of politics
109820	115200	or power and for being true believers in an absolutely horrible ideology. But that's only
115200	119840	a surface level critique of this stuff. For example, look at Groucho Marx's reply again.
119840	126100	She wants to be re-educating antisocial tendencies out of people in a gulag. So in a nonpolitical
126100	130600	sense, antisocial personality disorder is sociopathy. It's a mental disorder in which
130600	135040	a person consistently shows no regard for right or wrong and ignores the rights and
135080	139160	feelings of others. They tend to antagonize, manipulate or treat others harshly or with
139160	143760	callous indifference. They show no guilt or remorse for their behavior. But this is not
143760	150240	the socialist or anarchist view of antisocial. In a more casual sense, antisocial has come
150240	154180	to mean not interested in social activities. You know, you want to stay inside and play
154180	157880	video games all day instead of playing with your friends as a kid. That's an antisocial
157880	162680	activity. In the political sense, on the left, there is this idea, and yes, I've gone over
162680	166600	it a dozen times before on this channel. It's from Marx's On the Jewish Question,
166600	170520	of anti-individualism as a virtue. I do need to explain this, but I also don't want to
170520	174240	beat a dead horse completely. We've gone over this many times on this channel. So just
174240	180240	very quickly, in On the Jewish Question, Karl Marx critiques the liberal idea of individualism.
180240	183420	And there's a long passage on this, but I'll just read a short little bit of it. Liberty
183420	187580	is the right to do everything which does not harm others. The limits within each individual
187580	192240	can act without harming others are determined by law, just as the boundary between two fields
192240	196440	is marked by a stake. It is a question of the liberty of man regarded as an isolated
196440	200920	monad, withdrawn into himself. But liberty as a right of man is not founded upon the
200920	205480	relations between man and man, but rather upon the separation of man from man. It is
205480	209920	the right of separation, the right of the circumscribed individual withdrawn into himself.
209920	215960	Marx's critique here is that liberalism enshrines the right of one individual to stand separate
215960	221040	and apart from other individuals. When, Marx argues, correctly I might add, that the true
221040	226200	meaning of life comes from not who we stand separate from, but who we have connections
226200	229600	with. And this is of course true. Look at your friends, look at your family, look at
229600	233960	your spouse. These are people that you're not standing separate from as a rugged individualist.
233960	237880	You have some emotional connection there. Marx's critique is that that emotional connection
237880	242480	is not enshrined as a right. And of course it shouldn't be, because these are voluntary
242480	246800	things. You should have the option to choose who you are closely connected with and who
246800	250600	you are strangers with. However, Marx did not agree. Marx believed that because you
250600	256000	have some kind of economic connection between, say, the person that you buy your food from,
256000	262120	that economic connection engenders a permanent social obligation and responsibility. Because
262120	266520	you've engaged in trade with this person, they now have a say in what you do and you
266520	271600	now have a say in what they do. And it's this interlocking web that creates a society. And
271600	278540	so if you are an individual separated, as Marx said, an isolated monad, that is an egoist
278540	283060	antisocial way for an individual to act within a society. And so the socialist prescription
283060	286380	is that has to be stopped. That's why you see a lot of people like this Groucho Marx
286380	292420	woman who says, re-educating antisocial tendencies out of people. That is the anti-individualism
292420	297100	within socialism. But despite being massively made fun of, this question keeps coming up.
297100	300780	What's your job in the leftist commune? I'm going to be leading discussion on theory some
300780	305780	days, making clothes from scraps in other days, and making lattes whenever needed. Oh
305780	311460	boy, that sounds great. Our glorious communist utopia. We're all living on the leftist commune.
311460	315820	Who's making the food? I don't know. I'm reading theory, making clothes from scraps and making
315820	319240	coffee. That's all I can do. That's the only skills that I have. What will be your position
319240	324980	after communism is achieved? Oh Jesus, look at the quote tweets. Holy shit. Missionary,
324980	329960	doggy. Man, so many of these quote tweets are laughing at these people. I think everyone
329960	334780	knows how stupid this is now. Look at the delusion here. I'm going to be a local bookish
334780	338820	person who fishes a few times a week, teaches loosely organized seminars on history and
338820	342300	philosophy, and spends a lot of time hanging out with her lover in the forest. Why would
342300	345700	you be allowed? It's the people's forest. Those are all the people's resources that
345700	350340	you're using. The collective interest comes before your bourgeois desire to hang out in
350340	353740	the forest and contribute nothing to society. Here's one who kind of has the basic idea
353740	357740	down at least. The dirty jobs that are necessary, fair enough. Getting under the buildings and
357740	363140	working on pipes, roof repairs, digging trenches for the many purposes of a trench. Maybe the
363140	367260	one that you'll end up in. Pretty much anything manual labor that is required to fulfill the
367260	371020	need of the community. I happily offer my contributions. You can do that now. You can
371020	375220	get those jobs right now. What are my special talents? Music, mathematics, and teaching
375220	379020	are some of my skills. Under communism, those skills will be harnessed for the benefit of
379020	382780	the collective. The new human will be built on the basis of the new community existing
382780	387600	inside the new international society. How is this any different than the fascist conception
387600	391860	of individuals working for the glory of the state? The only difference seems to be that
391860	397640	the state in this conception spans the entire world. These people's conception of what communism
397640	403280	looks like is just fascism that is universalized rather than being particular to one people
403280	407560	or one ethnic group. But it's ultimately the same system. What job are guys going to have
407560	412060	under communism? I'm thinking I'll be a hunter in the morning, a fisherman in the afternoon,
412060	419080	a herdsman in the evening, and a critic after dinner. Oh boy. This is actually also again
419080	424000	a quote of Marx's. This time from the German ideology. This is a book I haven't yet covered
424000	427400	on the channel. The division of labor implies the contradiction between the interest of
427400	431120	the separate individual or the individual family and the communal interest of all individuals
431120	434920	who have intercourse with one another. And indeed, this communal interest does not exist
434920	439420	merely in the imagination as the general interest, but first of all in reality as the mutual
439420	443460	interdependence of the individuals among whom the labor is divided. And finally, the division
443460	447760	of labor offers us the first example of how, as long as man remains in natural society
447760	451400	that is, as long as a cleavage exists between the particular and the common interest, as
451400	456760	long therefore as activity is not voluntarily but naturally divided, man's own deed becomes
456760	461100	an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him. This
461100	464880	section is partially reaffirming what was said in On the Jewish Question, where Marx
464880	470020	believes that this communal interest, this lasting bond between people who have casual
470020	474380	contact with each other, a bond that exerts some kind of control, some kind of right,
474380	477480	which is something that liberals don't believe. We believe in individualism. We believe in
477480	481720	separation between uninvolved parties. But that doesn't exist within the Marxist framework.
481720	486440	As soon as the distribution of labor comes into being, each man has a particular exclusive
486440	491080	sphere of activity which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter,
491080	495880	a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, whatever that means, and must remain so if
495880	499440	he does not want to lose his means of livelihood. While in a communist society, where nobody
499440	503320	has one exclusive sphere of activity, but each can become accomplished in any branch
503320	507440	he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one
507440	510720	thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear
510720	514420	cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming
514420	517880	a hunter, fisherman, herdsman, or critic. And that's the quote that this person is
517880	521960	appealing to. Of course, we all understand how stupid this is, right? You could be a
521960	525280	hunter in the morning, a fisherman in the afternoon, a herdsman in the evening, and
525280	528780	a critic after dinner, but then you would be shitty at all of them. I made this point
528780	532360	back during that video about the woman who worked at LinkedIn who had an extremely cushy
532360	536900	life. The reason that we have the society that we have is because of division of labor
536900	541420	and how the division of labor allowed people to become extremely specialized. A person
541420	545820	who only hunts in the morning will never be as good a hunter as somebody who hunts all
545820	550260	day every day. That difference between them will lead to a difference in output. The truly
550260	554380	amazing hunter who has practiced his craft his entire life will be the one who actually
554380	557620	brings home the bacon, not the person who lazily hunts in the morning and doesn't
557620	562020	really contribute anything. And in fact, that's why our society is what it is. Because people
562020	566200	have specialized and with that specialization comes high level skill. And with that high
566200	571440	level skill comes high quality and high quantity output. And this is the primary reason why
571440	576340	the question of what will you do after the revolution is not only jokey and stupid as
576340	579880	something that we can turn into memes and make fun of because it really is just brainless,
579880	584880	but it also shows how incredibly ignorant socialists actually are the destruction of
584880	589660	all barriers between everything as well as the destruction of standards, which is something
589660	594100	that the left definitely trends towards that also necessarily means the destruction of
594100	597780	the ability to become competent at a thing. So when Mark says that he'll be a hunter
597780	600980	in the morning, a fisherman in the afternoon, a herdsman in the evening and a critic after
600980	606440	dinner, that would be a truly hellish society if that's how everyone was behaving. Because
606440	610540	we need specialization. We need people doing the same jobs and becoming really good at
610540	614440	them. This is a system that just instantly falls apart because no one's actually producing
614440	619180	what is necessary to keep society running. You can't be a brain surgeon in the morning,
619180	624180	a mechanic of large machinery in the afternoon, an architect in the evening and then like
624180	629280	a high level chemist at night. Almost nobody can get good enough at all of these things.
629280	633980	They're just too complicated. Things are just too hard. These people genuinely believe there
633980	637460	will be no work within a communist system. They can all just laze around and enjoy the
637460	641860	fruits of somebody's labor. I don't know who's doing the work. This is why these people always
641860	645780	say such dumb shit like abolish work. They just don't know what's happening behind the
645780	649820	curtain to keep society running. So yeah, this after the revolution rhetoric, there's
649820	654360	really two ways to look at it. And the first way is that it's funny, it's memes. We can
654360	658420	laugh at how stupid these people are. They have no idea how anything works. And they
658420	664100	are young, dumb, entitled, bourgeois, champagne socialists. And the second way to look at
664100	669420	it is the underlying philosophy, which is not only anti liberal, but anti individual,
669420	673500	anti freedom, anti human flourishing. And no matter how much they talk about the utopia
673500	677780	or how free everyone will be or anything else like that. What lies beneath is this
677780	682940	deep desire to control other people in the name of the collective interest. These are
682940	688860	not good people. Best case scenario, they're delusional dumb kids who will grow up. However,
688860	693540	it's absolutely the case that some of these people, if given the chance, would be just
693540	698180	as fucking terrible as some of the worst monsters in history, if some other monster didn't get
698180	702540	to them first. But hey, the best thing we can do in either case is keep laughing. We've
702580	707180	seen many times humor is what disarms tyrants. Alright, I'm getting out of here. I'm sure
707180	710060	you can tell this video is kind of off the cuff. I don't have any of this written down.
710060	713580	I'm just kind of I'm just kind of spouting from the hip. I have to go and actually record
713580	717660	a scripted video now. I was just doing this one for fun. Okay, I'll see you next time,
717660	718660	guys. I love you.
