00:00.000 --> 00:09.400
Hello, my friends. I hope you're having a wonderful day. Today, I would like to take

00:09.400 --> 00:15.800
a moment to talk about a phenomenon that I like to call wishful thinking after the revolution.

00:15.800 --> 00:20.320
And examining this idea shows us exactly what kind of people we're dealing with when we

00:20.320 --> 00:25.960
talk about, very broadly, leftist revolutionaries. This is the earliest instance I can find of

00:25.960 --> 00:30.860
this phenomenon. This is from 2017 on Twitter. Y'all ever think about what your roles will

00:30.860 --> 00:37.980
be post-revolution? The first person, Groucho Marx, says, I hope to be a therapist, maybe

00:37.980 --> 00:44.240
for general trauma, but maybe re-educating the antisocial tendencies out of people in

00:44.240 --> 00:50.200
a gulag. Quest Riggs says, this is a great thread. Red Army or the party if they'd take

00:50.200 --> 00:57.140
me. If not, communal farming. JL Hamilton says, logistics for the new Red Army, uniform

00:57.140 --> 01:02.120
design and equipment procurement. Now, the first level analysis of this is that all of

01:02.120 --> 01:05.880
these people are simply delusional. They think they would actually be allowed to control

01:05.880 --> 01:11.400
their own destinies in some individualistic manner after a socialist or communist or anarchist

01:11.400 --> 01:16.820
or whatever revolution. Even if they support those politics and supported that revolution,

01:16.820 --> 01:21.700
we all know that there is no way they would simply be allowed to do whatever they want.

01:21.700 --> 01:26.340
In fact, that's why there are so many memes of communist soldiers saying, that's amusing,

01:26.340 --> 01:31.860
please face the wall now. These people are the useful idiots that Yuri Bezmenov described,

01:31.860 --> 01:36.500
the ones that ideologically truly believe in socialism. And yet, after the power structure

01:36.500 --> 01:41.240
that protects them, namely liberal democracy, is destroyed, the true revolutionaries have

01:41.240 --> 01:45.500
no more use for them, so they are lined up and shot. So it's very easy on a surface level

01:45.500 --> 01:49.820
to just look at this and laugh at these people for not understanding the nature of politics

01:49.820 --> 01:55.200
or power and for being true believers in an absolutely horrible ideology. But that's only

01:55.200 --> 01:59.840
a surface level critique of this stuff. For example, look at Groucho Marx's reply again.

01:59.840 --> 02:06.100
She wants to be re-educating antisocial tendencies out of people in a gulag. So in a nonpolitical

02:06.100 --> 02:10.600
sense, antisocial personality disorder is sociopathy. It's a mental disorder in which

02:10.600 --> 02:15.040
a person consistently shows no regard for right or wrong and ignores the rights and

02:15.080 --> 02:19.160
feelings of others. They tend to antagonize, manipulate or treat others harshly or with

02:19.160 --> 02:23.760
callous indifference. They show no guilt or remorse for their behavior. But this is not

02:23.760 --> 02:30.240
the socialist or anarchist view of antisocial. In a more casual sense, antisocial has come

02:30.240 --> 02:34.180
to mean not interested in social activities. You know, you want to stay inside and play

02:34.180 --> 02:37.880
video games all day instead of playing with your friends as a kid. That's an antisocial

02:37.880 --> 02:42.680
activity. In the political sense, on the left, there is this idea, and yes, I've gone over

02:42.680 --> 02:46.600
it a dozen times before on this channel. It's from Marx's On the Jewish Question,

02:46.600 --> 02:50.520
of anti-individualism as a virtue. I do need to explain this, but I also don't want to

02:50.520 --> 02:54.240
beat a dead horse completely. We've gone over this many times on this channel. So just

02:54.240 --> 03:00.240
very quickly, in On the Jewish Question, Karl Marx critiques the liberal idea of individualism.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.420
And there's a long passage on this, but I'll just read a short little bit of it. Liberty

03:03.420 --> 03:07.580
is the right to do everything which does not harm others. The limits within each individual

03:07.580 --> 03:12.240
can act without harming others are determined by law, just as the boundary between two fields

03:12.240 --> 03:16.440
is marked by a stake. It is a question of the liberty of man regarded as an isolated

03:16.440 --> 03:20.920
monad, withdrawn into himself. But liberty as a right of man is not founded upon the

03:20.920 --> 03:25.480
relations between man and man, but rather upon the separation of man from man. It is

03:25.480 --> 03:29.920
the right of separation, the right of the circumscribed individual withdrawn into himself.

03:29.920 --> 03:35.960
Marx's critique here is that liberalism enshrines the right of one individual to stand separate

03:35.960 --> 03:41.040
and apart from other individuals. When, Marx argues, correctly I might add, that the true

03:41.040 --> 03:46.200
meaning of life comes from not who we stand separate from, but who we have connections

03:46.200 --> 03:49.600
with. And this is of course true. Look at your friends, look at your family, look at

03:49.600 --> 03:53.960
your spouse. These are people that you're not standing separate from as a rugged individualist.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.880
You have some emotional connection there. Marx's critique is that that emotional connection

03:57.880 --> 04:02.480
is not enshrined as a right. And of course it shouldn't be, because these are voluntary

04:02.480 --> 04:06.800
things. You should have the option to choose who you are closely connected with and who

04:06.800 --> 04:10.600
you are strangers with. However, Marx did not agree. Marx believed that because you

04:10.600 --> 04:16.000
have some kind of economic connection between, say, the person that you buy your food from,

04:16.000 --> 04:22.120
that economic connection engenders a permanent social obligation and responsibility. Because

04:22.120 --> 04:26.520
you've engaged in trade with this person, they now have a say in what you do and you

04:26.520 --> 04:31.600
now have a say in what they do. And it's this interlocking web that creates a society. And

04:31.600 --> 04:38.540
so if you are an individual separated, as Marx said, an isolated monad, that is an egoist

04:38.540 --> 04:43.060
antisocial way for an individual to act within a society. And so the socialist prescription

04:43.060 --> 04:46.380
is that has to be stopped. That's why you see a lot of people like this Groucho Marx

04:46.380 --> 04:52.420
woman who says, re-educating antisocial tendencies out of people. That is the anti-individualism

04:52.420 --> 04:57.100
within socialism. But despite being massively made fun of, this question keeps coming up.

04:57.100 --> 05:00.780
What's your job in the leftist commune? I'm going to be leading discussion on theory some

05:00.780 --> 05:05.780
days, making clothes from scraps in other days, and making lattes whenever needed. Oh

05:05.780 --> 05:11.460
boy, that sounds great. Our glorious communist utopia. We're all living on the leftist commune.

05:11.460 --> 05:15.820
Who's making the food? I don't know. I'm reading theory, making clothes from scraps and making

05:15.820 --> 05:19.240
coffee. That's all I can do. That's the only skills that I have. What will be your position

05:19.240 --> 05:24.980
after communism is achieved? Oh Jesus, look at the quote tweets. Holy shit. Missionary,

05:24.980 --> 05:29.960
doggy. Man, so many of these quote tweets are laughing at these people. I think everyone

05:29.960 --> 05:34.780
knows how stupid this is now. Look at the delusion here. I'm going to be a local bookish

05:34.780 --> 05:38.820
person who fishes a few times a week, teaches loosely organized seminars on history and

05:38.820 --> 05:42.300
philosophy, and spends a lot of time hanging out with her lover in the forest. Why would

05:42.300 --> 05:45.700
you be allowed? It's the people's forest. Those are all the people's resources that

05:45.700 --> 05:50.340
you're using. The collective interest comes before your bourgeois desire to hang out in

05:50.340 --> 05:53.740
the forest and contribute nothing to society. Here's one who kind of has the basic idea

05:53.740 --> 05:57.740
down at least. The dirty jobs that are necessary, fair enough. Getting under the buildings and

05:57.740 --> 06:03.140
working on pipes, roof repairs, digging trenches for the many purposes of a trench. Maybe the

06:03.140 --> 06:07.260
one that you'll end up in. Pretty much anything manual labor that is required to fulfill the

06:07.260 --> 06:11.020
need of the community. I happily offer my contributions. You can do that now. You can

06:11.020 --> 06:15.220
get those jobs right now. What are my special talents? Music, mathematics, and teaching

06:15.220 --> 06:19.020
are some of my skills. Under communism, those skills will be harnessed for the benefit of

06:19.020 --> 06:22.780
the collective. The new human will be built on the basis of the new community existing

06:22.780 --> 06:27.600
inside the new international society. How is this any different than the fascist conception

06:27.600 --> 06:31.860
of individuals working for the glory of the state? The only difference seems to be that

06:31.860 --> 06:37.640
the state in this conception spans the entire world. These people's conception of what communism

06:37.640 --> 06:43.280
looks like is just fascism that is universalized rather than being particular to one people

06:43.280 --> 06:47.560
or one ethnic group. But it's ultimately the same system. What job are guys going to have

06:47.560 --> 06:52.060
under communism? I'm thinking I'll be a hunter in the morning, a fisherman in the afternoon,

06:52.060 --> 06:59.080
a herdsman in the evening, and a critic after dinner. Oh boy. This is actually also again

06:59.080 --> 07:04.000
a quote of Marx's. This time from the German ideology. This is a book I haven't yet covered

07:04.000 --> 07:07.400
on the channel. The division of labor implies the contradiction between the interest of

07:07.400 --> 07:11.120
the separate individual or the individual family and the communal interest of all individuals

07:11.120 --> 07:14.920
who have intercourse with one another. And indeed, this communal interest does not exist

07:14.920 --> 07:19.420
merely in the imagination as the general interest, but first of all in reality as the mutual

07:19.420 --> 07:23.460
interdependence of the individuals among whom the labor is divided. And finally, the division

07:23.460 --> 07:27.760
of labor offers us the first example of how, as long as man remains in natural society

07:27.760 --> 07:31.400
that is, as long as a cleavage exists between the particular and the common interest, as

07:31.400 --> 07:36.760
long therefore as activity is not voluntarily but naturally divided, man's own deed becomes

07:36.760 --> 07:41.100
an alien power opposed to him, which enslaves him instead of being controlled by him. This

07:41.100 --> 07:44.880
section is partially reaffirming what was said in On the Jewish Question, where Marx

07:44.880 --> 07:50.020
believes that this communal interest, this lasting bond between people who have casual

07:50.020 --> 07:54.380
contact with each other, a bond that exerts some kind of control, some kind of right,

07:54.380 --> 07:57.480
which is something that liberals don't believe. We believe in individualism. We believe in

07:57.480 --> 08:01.720
separation between uninvolved parties. But that doesn't exist within the Marxist framework.

08:01.720 --> 08:06.440
As soon as the distribution of labor comes into being, each man has a particular exclusive

08:06.440 --> 08:11.080
sphere of activity which is forced upon him and from which he cannot escape. He is a hunter,

08:11.080 --> 08:15.880
a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, whatever that means, and must remain so if

08:15.880 --> 08:19.440
he does not want to lose his means of livelihood. While in a communist society, where nobody

08:19.440 --> 08:23.320
has one exclusive sphere of activity, but each can become accomplished in any branch

08:23.320 --> 08:27.440
he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one

08:27.440 --> 08:30.720
thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear

08:30.720 --> 08:34.420
cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming

08:34.420 --> 08:37.880
a hunter, fisherman, herdsman, or critic. And that's the quote that this person is

08:37.880 --> 08:41.960
appealing to. Of course, we all understand how stupid this is, right? You could be a

08:41.960 --> 08:45.280
hunter in the morning, a fisherman in the afternoon, a herdsman in the evening, and

08:45.280 --> 08:48.780
a critic after dinner, but then you would be shitty at all of them. I made this point

08:48.780 --> 08:52.360
back during that video about the woman who worked at LinkedIn who had an extremely cushy

08:52.360 --> 08:56.900
life. The reason that we have the society that we have is because of division of labor

08:56.900 --> 09:01.420
and how the division of labor allowed people to become extremely specialized. A person

09:01.420 --> 09:05.820
who only hunts in the morning will never be as good a hunter as somebody who hunts all

09:05.820 --> 09:10.260
day every day. That difference between them will lead to a difference in output. The truly

09:10.260 --> 09:14.380
amazing hunter who has practiced his craft his entire life will be the one who actually

09:14.380 --> 09:17.620
brings home the bacon, not the person who lazily hunts in the morning and doesn't

09:17.620 --> 09:22.020
really contribute anything. And in fact, that's why our society is what it is. Because people

09:22.020 --> 09:26.200
have specialized and with that specialization comes high level skill. And with that high

09:26.200 --> 09:31.440
level skill comes high quality and high quantity output. And this is the primary reason why

09:31.440 --> 09:36.340
the question of what will you do after the revolution is not only jokey and stupid as

09:36.340 --> 09:39.880
something that we can turn into memes and make fun of because it really is just brainless,

09:39.880 --> 09:44.880
but it also shows how incredibly ignorant socialists actually are the destruction of

09:44.880 --> 09:49.660
all barriers between everything as well as the destruction of standards, which is something

09:49.660 --> 09:54.100
that the left definitely trends towards that also necessarily means the destruction of

09:54.100 --> 09:57.780
the ability to become competent at a thing. So when Mark says that he'll be a hunter

09:57.780 --> 10:00.980
in the morning, a fisherman in the afternoon, a herdsman in the evening and a critic after

10:00.980 --> 10:06.440
dinner, that would be a truly hellish society if that's how everyone was behaving. Because

10:06.440 --> 10:10.540
we need specialization. We need people doing the same jobs and becoming really good at

10:10.540 --> 10:14.440
them. This is a system that just instantly falls apart because no one's actually producing

10:14.440 --> 10:19.180
what is necessary to keep society running. You can't be a brain surgeon in the morning,

10:19.180 --> 10:24.180
a mechanic of large machinery in the afternoon, an architect in the evening and then like

10:24.180 --> 10:29.280
a high level chemist at night. Almost nobody can get good enough at all of these things.

10:29.280 --> 10:33.980
They're just too complicated. Things are just too hard. These people genuinely believe there

10:33.980 --> 10:37.460
will be no work within a communist system. They can all just laze around and enjoy the

10:37.460 --> 10:41.860
fruits of somebody's labor. I don't know who's doing the work. This is why these people always

10:41.860 --> 10:45.780
say such dumb shit like abolish work. They just don't know what's happening behind the

10:45.780 --> 10:49.820
curtain to keep society running. So yeah, this after the revolution rhetoric, there's

10:49.820 --> 10:54.360
really two ways to look at it. And the first way is that it's funny, it's memes. We can

10:54.360 --> 10:58.420
laugh at how stupid these people are. They have no idea how anything works. And they

10:58.420 --> 11:04.100
are young, dumb, entitled, bourgeois, champagne socialists. And the second way to look at

11:04.100 --> 11:09.420
it is the underlying philosophy, which is not only anti liberal, but anti individual,

11:09.420 --> 11:13.500
anti freedom, anti human flourishing. And no matter how much they talk about the utopia

11:13.500 --> 11:17.780
or how free everyone will be or anything else like that. What lies beneath is this

11:17.780 --> 11:22.940
deep desire to control other people in the name of the collective interest. These are

11:22.940 --> 11:28.860
not good people. Best case scenario, they're delusional dumb kids who will grow up. However,

11:28.860 --> 11:33.540
it's absolutely the case that some of these people, if given the chance, would be just

11:33.540 --> 11:38.180
as fucking terrible as some of the worst monsters in history, if some other monster didn't get

11:38.180 --> 11:42.540
to them first. But hey, the best thing we can do in either case is keep laughing. We've

11:42.580 --> 11:47.180
seen many times humor is what disarms tyrants. Alright, I'm getting out of here. I'm sure

11:47.180 --> 11:50.060
you can tell this video is kind of off the cuff. I don't have any of this written down.

11:50.060 --> 11:53.580
I'm just kind of I'm just kind of spouting from the hip. I have to go and actually record

11:53.580 --> 11:57.660
a scripted video now. I was just doing this one for fun. Okay, I'll see you next time,

11:57.660 --> 11:58.660
guys. I love you.
