1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
If there's one trend that I'm really enjoying right now, it's the posting their L's accounts.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,500
E-boys posting their L's. E-girls posting their L's. Think tanks posting their L's.

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,660
Coomers posting their L's. But the one that I like most of all, and probably the only one that

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:29,020
I can intersectionally talk about myself, is fat people posting their L's. And yes, being a person

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,720
of size myself, I am in fact allowed to do this video topic. Nobody else can. None of you thin

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:42,100
people, otherwise known as thiggers, can in fact do this. Only we fats can, understand? I just want

7
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:48,600
to point out before we begin, this is definitely a video where we laugh and chuckle. It's less

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,080
about the point, even though there will be a point at the end. It's less about the point and more

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,760
about the fun. So let's go. I would rather be out here celebrating and finding peace with our

10
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,180
magical bodies rather than projecting our own insecurities. Edit. Actually, it would be nice

11
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,920
if people could just mind their own fucking business. I love the use of the black emojis.

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,960
I use them all the time too. Honestly, take the time to try and decolonize your mind instead of

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,860
sucking the joy out of fat pussy love. Man, we're starting off strong. I don't even know, like, am I

14
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,100
allowed to show you this? Because like, that looks like it might be the vagina, but I can't tell.

15
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,760
Actually, I can't, you know what, looking at it now, I can't even tell what side of the person

16
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,880
we're looking at. It's diabetes and coronary artery disease. Can you rephrase that in body

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,840
positive terms? Okay, I'll give it a shot. You're so brave and fabulous that your pancreas and heart

18
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,640
can't keep up. Oh yeah, I remember this. I remember this from back during, I think, the release of

19
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,920
Smash 4 when Sakurai added the Wii Fit Trainer character. Looks like I won't be buying Super

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,860
Smash Bros since Nintendo apparently supports fat shaming, as seen by the inclusion of the

21
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:06,660
whitewashed embodiment of thin privilege herself, the Wii Fit Trainer. Okay, so for those of you who

22
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:13,340
don't know, basically on the Wii they had a balance board. You could stand on it, do exercises with

23
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,220
it. It was a pretty good casual game. There was a lot of like yoga and stuff, but the actual mascot

24
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,940
of the game was this mannequin-looking woman who would move around and do the yoga with you and

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,680
show you how to do it. I mean, she's very clearly not like a white person. She's a white mannequin.

26
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,640
Like she's just like pure eggshell white, you know? But even back then, back when Wii Fit came

27
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,520
out, which was what, 2008 or something, people were complaining that Nintendo was being fat

28
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,160
phobic for releasing the game. After the horrifying fiasco that was Microsoft's conference yesterday

29
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,560
where a woman was literally raped for losing a round of killer instinct. Oh yeah, I remember

30
00:02:53,620 --> 00:03:01,620
this. This was like, what, 2012, 2013's E3? Check out this clip, guys. This is gonna get interesting.

31
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,980
For those of you who don't know, Torin's the producer for Killer Instinct, and he's brought

32
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,700
out the new tournament edition, Mad Catz Fight Stick, which will be available at the launch

33
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:17,140
of Killer Instinct. Good luck, Ashton. Come on, Ashton, bring it. Whoever thought it was a good

34
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,060
idea that I play against a producer is gonna get it. Come on, you gotta practice before you get on

35
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:28,600
stage in front of millions of people. I can't even block correctly, and you're too fast. There

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,760
we go. Just let it happen, it'll be over soon. You have a fight stick! Man, if this happened

37
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,280
like E3 2020 or 2021, there would be such an outrage mob, but back then it was just laughed

38
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,480
about on 4chan. Obese woman was arrested for starving her seven kids. There was only enough

39
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,620
food for me. Look at the fucking picture, look at this woman and look at those kids. They're

40
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:57,240
like skeletons, dude, they're like Ethiopian level. A disturbing report is coming out of

41
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,620
Louisiana this morning that tells the story of 27-year-old Lakisha Connors, who reportedly

42
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,220
starved her children nearly to death. Mother of seven was arrested on Thursday evening when

43
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,780
neighbors called police and said they saw extremely unhealthy looking children digging

44
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,640
through the trash cans on the side yard. When police arrived and knocked on the door,

45
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,920
they were greeted by three-year-old Ammonette Connors and five-year-old Dante Connors who

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,820
let them into the home. Authorities say they found the mother passed out on the couch. What

47
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:34,360
the actual fuck? Okay, we can tell by the size of this woman, there's clearly more than enough

48
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,720
food going around. The kids could literally eat their mother and be fine for a few years here,

49
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:47,400
sometimes we eat, sometimes we don't. Yeah, press X to doubt. Oh God,

50
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:55,220
do you even want to read this story? Let's talk accessibility. I'm an infini-fat. You're

51
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:01,560
infinitely fat, meaning I wear plus 30 clothing in the UK and many shops don't carry that. I use

52
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,740
the disabled toilet because that's what I need to do, but they're still not very fat friendly.

53
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,240
Things are put as close together as possible, giving me no space to wipe myself. Oh God,

54
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,880
I'm luckily flexible and do what I call a wipe yoga. I have to take off my bottoms and often

55
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:25,080
one shoe to be able to place my leg on the wall or something else to balance on to wipe. Imagine

56
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,480
letting yourself get so fat that you have to do yoga to reach your asshole. This can be a

57
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,760
workout. I'm panting, shaking, and starting to feel rubbish afterwards. Well, you do need a

58
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,860
workout, but I do need the toilet sometimes like all humans do. In the UK, they like to lock the

59
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,980
damn doors for a disabled user. You have to hunt down a person with the key. It's exhausting,

60
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,380
and this time I'm at the National Museum in Cardiff and the bloody toilets are down a flight

61
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,420
of stairs. The lift doesn't work. I can and do walk up and down stairs, but people who can't,

62
00:05:53,420 --> 00:06:00,060
it's bullshit. And then they, what was it? They had some Arby's. You might be thinking Arby's,

63
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,160
but you probably shouldn't be eating it if you're having to do wipe yoga. How do you poo?

64
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:20,700
I weigh nearly 600 pounds now, so I have to sit down, but not on the toilet because it would

65
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:26,360
break. I use a beanbag chair as my toilet because when I sit on it, it creates a kind of space in

66
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:32,180
the middle with surrounding walls. So when I shit, the fecal matter spreads around me,

67
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:39,980
but doesn't overflow. Then I scoop the shit into the toilet, usually flushing four or five times

68
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,700
to get it all down. It fucking sucks because I use the same beanbag for general sitting,

69
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:58,040
and it's starting to smell. Don't get fat, bros. I've tried shitting into a mini fridge

70
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:04,540
that has been turned on so the cold would cause the shit to condense its moisture and make it

71
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:12,800
easier to flush, but it wasn't comfortable. I can just imagine this fat whoa jack here holding a

72
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:20,140
full-ass mini fridge directly up to his asshole and filling it with shit. They sent my OnlyFans

73
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:30,200
content to my fans. Is this a real video? There's no way this woman... Oh my God, it's real.

74
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,340
I have feelings when it comes to my OnlyFans, and you guys are probably like,

75
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:55,220
just quit fucking talking about it. I have to because I'll just explain. So for me,

76
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:02,840
I'm trying to break the stigma that that girls are too big or too impulsive or too overweight

77
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:12,780
to have sex because just like our appetites, sex can be a bit ravenous too. Is that why you

78
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:18,020
have the tusks? Good God the comments on this video were unreal. Hey Wendy's, my overweight

79
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,520
friend and her adult daughters went to your Toledo store. Richard at the counter, who had

80
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,620
never met them before, had said the usual. My friend says, what are you talking about? Richard

81
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:35,120
says two of everything. She doesn't even want her lunch now she's crying. I always knew Wendy's

82
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:43,200
was based, but damn. Mum who spent 93 pounds to travel 82 miles for Tinder date called fat and

83
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:51,800
then dumped. That's rough. Tinder's a rough place to be anyway. The pair had met a few times before

84
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,880
and she was chatting to him on the phone when she arrived. She explained, that's when he said,

85
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,740
fuck me, you've put on some weight, haven't you? I was like, no, you can't say that. Hold on,

86
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,660
hold on, hold on, hold on. So if you haven't put on the weight, you just say, no, I haven't. Like

87
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,260
if there's some kind of like miscommunication or he misremembers or something, but she doesn't even

88
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:21,660
deny it, she just says it, you can't say that to me. And she started a GoFundMe to get her

89
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:27,920
90 pounds back because her date called her fat. I just want to make my 90 pounds travel money back

90
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,800
so I can buy wine and sticks of lard. There are like a billion funny stories like that,

91
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,920
but as you keep digging just beyond the surface level humor, being to realize there's actually

92
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,800
like a fat positivity movement or something. Dear my skinny friends, what are you actively

93
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:50,940
doing to unlearn the gaze that renders fat folks unattractive? Now you can see this is,

94
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,980
this is already steeped in that intersectionalist language where it's, it's unlearn rather than

95
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,460
something being innate like attraction or it's, it's a gaze like the male gaze. You know,

96
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,040
this is the anti-fat gaze that apparently we all have when we're not attracted to a fat person.

97
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,300
It's strange because we accept sexual orientation as being an immutable characteristic, right? This

98
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,960
idea that you can't really change who you're attracted to. And yet when it comes to like in

99
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,560
the super straight video, being attracted to trans people or being attracted to fat people,

100
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,200
like, like in this video, uh, now it's something that needs to be unlearned. Imagine telling a gay

101
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,340
person to unlearn their attraction. See how far that would get you. Dear friends with bodies of

102
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:38,720
normalized sizes. See, even the way, like I could just pick apart every single sentence here because

103
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,100
I kind of, I've been reading a lot of books on intersectionality and critical theory,

104
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,620
and they, they phrase it this way so that rather than being fat is something that they've done to

105
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,520
themselves, whether that through diet, lack of exercise, even if they have some kind of medical

106
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,320
condition that makes them more prone to put on weight, they haven't managed it well, rather than

107
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,540
it being any of those things. It is something that society has pushed on them. It's external.

108
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,760
So rather than being thin or making themselves thin or keeping themselves thin, your average

109
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:16,740
person has bodies of normalized sizes. See this now passive that sounds how it's simply society's

110
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,100
fault that those sizes are normalized. And that's the only issue we're dealing with here. Let's stop

111
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,300
pretending that our non desires are simply preferences and not culturally informed. So,

112
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,220
okay. Literally the argument that Christians gave against gay marriage got it. Or as if they were

113
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:40,940
just a given fact that one can't influence. If your idea of body positivity stops at simply not

114
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:48,200
actively shaming fat folks, I call it doesn't go far enough. Okay. So if you're not having sex with

115
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:55,220
the fat person, then you are oppressive. Suck the fat roll bigot. This whole thing honestly

116
00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,840
reads like it was written by an incel. As queers, we've left the heteronormative desirability matrix,

117
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,280
but what about the other norms that determine who's hot and who's not, including those within

118
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,440
our own communities, hand on heart? How many of the people you had a crush on were fat? How many

119
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,920
are your partners? Are the people you swipe right on Tinder, message on OkCupid or flirt with at the

120
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,800
club, mainly thin people, masculine presenting, able bodied and white? We are literally at the

121
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,840
policing other people's consent stage of radical intersectionality because a lot of these broadly

122
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,320
radical left ideas require violating people's consent. If you're a socialist, you have to

123
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,120
violate the consent of people who own property, or even if they don't own property, they don't

124
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,280
want their labor collectivized. If you're an intersectionalist, you have to violate people's

125
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,000
consent in this way. It no longer matters if you choose X. If that's an oppressive choice,

126
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,520
your consent doesn't matter anymore. Consent is basically a modern expression of the older liberal

127
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,640
conception of natural rights, and the left's historic materialists have already given up

128
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,800
the idea of natural rights. And yeah, we've already reached the point too where they have

129
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:13,040
to basically go actively hunting for microaggressions. Fellow fats, fellow fats,

130
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,440
what's something that's not explicitly anti-fat, but you experience as anti-fatness? For example,

131
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,160
when thin friends only seem to want to process their body insecurities with you,

132
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,840
their fattest friend, talking to you at length about food addiction, etc. I've noticed that

133
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,960
people feel really entitled to my time and help. I get approached a lot with people asking for

134
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,720
directions, where something is, if I know which train someone needs to get on, etc. etc. So yeah,

135
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,760
yeah, we're at the point where asking someone directions is fatphobia. Of course, these things

136
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,960
intersect in strange ways, don't they? Men who don't wear jackets in cold weather do so with

137
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,280
the express intent of intimidating women and to make women feel like lesser beings. If you see

138
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,200
a man who is not wearing a jacket when you're cold, then call him out on his toxic masculinity

139
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:05,240
and his ego violence. Yeah, well, you know what sentient Jessica? What if that man is just really,

140
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,280
really fat and therefore the cold doesn't really affect them at all? Like they have all that extra

141
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,320
blubber to insulate things. Are you going to be fatphobic and call them out then? Why are men

142
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,840
larger than women? It makes no evolutionary sense for women to be smaller, because everything from

143
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:26,720
birthing children to surviving predators would be easier if we were the same size as men. So why are

144
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,480
we smaller? Because men have starved women of food for untold generations to ensure their own

145
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,440
survival. A smaller body means women can survive with less food and have more to share with their

146
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,880
children because with men around, both mother and child are going to get less of everything. So

147
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,120
smaller women were more likely to survive a time of famine and therefore we have evolved to become

148
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:57,040
smaller so we can survive men's greed. This sounds very anti-fat to me. In fact, it sounds like you're

149
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:04,920
saying a fat person's fatness is based not on an immutable characteristic, but on diet. How dare

150
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,520
you? This asexual TikToker has a message for haters. Alright, let's check it out. My name is

151
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:23,200
Steven McHale and I identify as asexual. Don't worry buddy, the feeling is mutual. That's the

152
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,320
thing, a lot of asexuality is caused by being ridiculously overweight to the point that the

153
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:36,280
sex drive plummets and I think there's definitely some kind of overlap between people rigidly

154
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,480
demanding that asexuality be accepted and fair enough, if you're asexual, like whatever, right?

155
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,560
But the fact that there is a overlap between that and being very unhealthy, I have a feeling that if

156
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,680
most asexuals, not all, but if most asexuals got a handle on their health, they probably wouldn't be

157
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:01,800
asexuals anymore. Keto is racist. Sargon, Sargon, I didn't know you were this kind of a person. I

158
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:08,400
can't prove it, but just gives me white supremacy vibes. To be honest, any diet or anything that

159
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,920
promotes weight loss is oppressive. I rest my case, your honor. This tweet was a joke when I

160
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,080
was half asleep, but since y'all want to get into it, let's do it, okay? First, keto was originally

161
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,840
created to treat patients who had epilepsy and somehow white women co-opted it into a weight

162
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:30,120
loss diet, so it's ableist. Diet culture and fat phobia are rooted in racism and white supremacy.

163
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:37,000
Any diet or restrictive eating that alters your body from its natural state is racist. The beauty

164
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,960
model, hold the fuck on, wait, wait, wait, wait a second, alters your body from its natural state.

165
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:50,080
Does this mean that every single trans person is racist? The beauty model most wanted to achieve

166
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,440
is a colonized goal. We have to decolonize the way we should let our body be and grow. So,

167
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:03,240
when trans people take hormones or surgically alter their body, it's racism? There is a coup

168
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,320
going on in the New York Times Cooking Community Facebook group. Here's the scoop. A member posted

169
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,560
about making sure to vote, and the moderators removed his post since the group is supposed

170
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:19,240
to be a haven from politics focused only on food. Judging by your avatar, you too are focused only

171
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,240
on food. The members, numbering over 62,000, weren't having it and made it clear that food

172
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,600
is undoubtedly political. They began to fashion food to spell vote using captions only directly

173
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,800
related to food. Bottom line, food is political. Food can be used to build community, change lives,

174
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:45,200
feed the hungry, inspire creativity, and it could also be easily squandered. Use your voice and your

175
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,960
food to inspire change. Do you think you could change your diet? Hot tip. Posting weight loss

176
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,360
photos shows us which bodies you value, no matter how body positive your caption sounds. If you

177
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,240
don't want us to believe thinner is better, then stop reinforcing that message under the guise of

178
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:11,120
self-love. That's right, my friends. Weight loss progress is ableist, or fatphobic, or racist,

179
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,040
or whatever the fuck. And that's actually been a really common thing for people to say the past

180
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,760
few years. Remember when, um, what's that one singer's name? I forget her name, she was a fat

181
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,400
singer and she lost all of her weight. And people were just like descending on her like, how dare

182
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,640
you post the fact that you lost all your fat and now you look like a regular person. It's like,

183
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,160
geez dude, like are you, are you so jealous that you haven't lost your own weight yet that you're

184
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,160
gonna just shit on everyone who is trying to live healthier and self-improve. Buying plus-size

185
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,560
clothing from thrift stores you can tailor the items down to your size zero body isn't a cute

186
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:51,960
YouTube video idea. It's fatphobic and classist and taking resources away from poor fat people

187
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,800
who have an infinitely harder time finding clothes than you do. Okay, so do not buy clothes that

188
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,840
aren't your size. Got it. Can we also apply this to fat people who still think that they fit into

189
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,640
like their high school clothing and are walking around in stuff that is like obviously too tight

190
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,040
and nobody wants to see that. I just ran an entire mile in nine minutes and 26 seconds.

191
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,440
I used to weigh 363 pounds and now I'm running a mile in under 10 minutes. Congratulations. You,

192
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,200
you, you, you, you. Why did so many of my mutuals I thought were body positive like this? Bye.

193
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,680
You're literally just jealous and bitter that this person has gotten into shape and is now

194
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:36,680
like running. I thought you were body positive. Like really, you don't think that like an athlete's

195
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,960
body is something also worthy of being positive towards? Just say no to transformation Tuesday.

196
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,000
Whether you're trying to depict your weight loss or weight gain, these pics aren't helpful.

197
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,560
Preliminary research, God, you're always with these appeals. Preliminary research has shown

198
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:00,080
that exposure to transformation pictures of any kind of social media increases negative body image

199
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,240
and self-objectification. When it comes down to it, these types of images promote physical

200
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,360
comparisons. They promote fat phobia when depicting weight loss. When depicting weight gain,

201
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,400
they promote competition and feelings of not being sick enough among the recovery community.

202
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:20,280
Just say no to transformation pics. Literally hide me from my own ideals that I don't feel bad.

203
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:26,840
If you post a weight loss before and after pics, I will instantly unfollow you. It's triggering an

204
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,640
inherently fat phobic smooch. What you choose to do with your body is your business, but promoting

205
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,160
and celebrating weight loss is triggering for many people and is deeply entrenched in fat phobia.

206
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,320
What you're showing every fat person is that our bodies are something to hate,

207
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,320
something to celebrate becoming smaller. Diet culture is buried in capitalism and racism. I

208
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,880
am no longer gently asking people to educate themselves. Now is the time to examine every

209
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,200
way you make passes in your life with these violent systems. This also extends to the way

210
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,080
fitness culture has adopted body-positive language in ways that promote fat phobia

211
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,760
insidiously. Do what makes you feel good in your body, but the ways we celebrate our

212
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:15,760
bodies becoming smaller is still deeply entwined in fat phobia. Translation here is that the

213
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,280
ideology is more important than the reality. It doesn't matter about your health. It doesn't even

214
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:26,820
matter about how you feel. It doesn't matter about your goals. What matters is the ideology.

215
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,140
If you do something that is by all other objective metrics good for you,

216
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:40,980
if it's fat phobic, that's what matters. Junk food does not exist. I wish. Food is food. The

217
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,820
use of this language is generally to police fat people, but fat people have existed before that

218
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:52,180
language and will exist after it's long gone. Yeah dude, all of those starving kulaks, they

219
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:58,660
were like 600 pounds and they all died, eh? Is that how it was? Food is food. You need fats and

220
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:04,100
carbohydrates too. Well, not really carbohydrates, but you do need fats. Food is not healthy or

221
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:11,020
unhealthy. It's food. Railing against junk food or unhealthy food is hella anti-black, classist,

222
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,460
and anti-black. How is it anti-black? Food is motherfucking food. Food provides food

223
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,020
treatments. Food is good. So many people have such horrific relationships with food because

224
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,260
diet culture teaches us to. Imagine that everything you thought you knew about food

225
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:30,060
was taught on a white supremacist, capitalist, anti-black foundation because it was. Man,

226
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:38,780
like this is where the drive for ultimate equality leads us. Everything must be equal to every other

227
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:45,740
thing all the time. There is no difference between say eating a really greasy, fully loaded pizza and

228
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:52,420
a protein shake. It's all just food. Nutrients and macros and calories, none of that shit exists.

229
00:22:52,420 --> 00:23:00,660
If it's all the same, why don't you just eat dirt? Casual fucking reminder that the white race

230
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:07,860
scientists invent, white race scientists. Race science, you guys. When they measure your waist,

231
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:13,100
it's like measuring your skull. All right, all right. Casual fucking reminder that white race

232
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:20,620
scientists invented fat phobia and the concept of obesity. If you are ever fat phobic or on some,

233
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:25,700
oh well fat is unhealthy, ooh, ooh bullshit, I hope you fucking know that someone's white

234
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:34,380
ancestor is smiling in their grave. You know, a show that was considered woke and radically left,

235
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:42,020
say 10, 15, I think almost even 20 years ago was the Boondocks. And in one of those episodes

236
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:48,900
of the Boondocks, grandpa opens a restaurant for soul food where they cook up, you know,

237
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,900
culturally relevant black foods, but they're also very, very unhealthy. And it turns out that the

238
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:00,060
reason that, you know, black people historically ate that way was because one, they were slaves,

239
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,420
they had to eat whatever they could get it, get their hands on. And two, because they were very

240
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:10,700
poor, even after slavery was abolished. And so this culture of cooking very unhealthy,

241
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:17,260
but very cheap foods and making them taste very good came about. And grandpa keeps serving this

242
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,100
food because he's black and it's part of his culture. And even though he's no longer poor,

243
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,180
the way that he was when he was young, still feels a cultural impetus to serve this food.

244
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:33,820
And of course people eat it and they fucking like fall asleep in the restaurant because it's just

245
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,500
so, you know, insulin overpowering. I'm pretty sure some even has like a heart attack in the

246
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,020
restaurant. I haven't seen the episode in years and years, so I don't know. But basically the

247
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:50,740
point is, is that even then, even in this woke lefty show, they said our ancestors ate this

248
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:57,420
stuff because they had to. And even though it is a cultural celebration, maybe we can also move past

249
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:03,020
it. Since then, instead of moving past it, they've decided to simply make being fat part of black

250
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,460
culture. All right. Plus sized women admit they aren't attracted to overweight men. Wait, wait,

251
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:14,220
wait a second. Why are the women plus sized and the men overweight as a plus sized woman? There's

252
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,260
this expectation that she'd only date overweight men. These women open up about dealing with the

253
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:25,140
stigma of being plus sized and refusing to settle and date overweight men. Well, hold on. Do you

254
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,980
think that like regular sized men should settle and date you? Like, why is it settling when you

255
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:35,620
do it, but not when they, what the fuck is this? Sometimes I feel guilty because I'm not attracted

256
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:40,860
to bigger guys, even though I'm plus size myself. I find it rare to find a big guy that takes care

257
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,540
of his appearance and hygiene the way I do. I'm a plus size woman, but I'm not attracted to big

258
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,460
guys. I get a lot of hate and criticism for that, but I can't help that I like average to muscular

259
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,980
types. Well, it sounds like you need to decolonize your thinking on this and become more attracted to

260
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:02,300
fat people. I'm plus size and I'm not attracted to really big guys. I've never been ruder me. It's

261
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,620
just not my thing. Everyone has a body they like to look at and overweight man is not one of mine.

262
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,860
I feel so hypocritical. I'm plus size and I'm not attracted to bigger guys. I only like average body

263
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,460
types. Not a ton of muscles, just average. I hate when people think I have to date bigger guys

264
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:20,900
because I'm plus sized. I can't help that I'm not attracted to them and I like muscular guys. Look

265
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:27,460
at all this colonized thinking. I can't help it. Yes, you can. Thinness ain't an accomplishment.

266
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,100
Weight loss ain't an accomplishment. I know y'all hate fat people and fatness so much. You believe

267
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,980
the size of your body should be can praise and congratulate it over. So now we've moved past

268
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:42,620
don't talk about your accomplishments into it's not even an accomplishment. This process is like

269
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:49,820
Yuri Bezmenov applied to fat people. Things have gotten so ridiculous that I think this is in the

270
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:57,320
UK. I'm pretty sure it's in the UK. There was a proposed law to make it illegal to alter your

271
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:04,780
online photos that you look thinner than you actually are. Tory MP Dr. Luke Evans said doctored

272
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:11,700
Instagram images are creating a warped view of beauty and fueling a mental health crisis. We

273
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,340
will monitor your social media and if it does not show you exactly as fat as we think you are,

274
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:22,860
we will fine you. And of course to go along with all these takes an entire industry of like,

275
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:29,620
I don't know how we'd even even call it like alternative science has appeared to fuel and

276
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:36,100
feed these people no pun intended. All of the reassurance that could ever possibly want. Fat

277
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:42,260
is not the problem. Fat stigma is. Health experts, notice how the word experts is in quotes this time

278
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:46,820
around when it goes against the narrative, are sending incorrect and destructive messages about

279
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:53,460
the relationship between weight and wellness. Are you sure? Obesity is the biggest threat to the

280
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,500
health of our nation. This all too common suggestion does far greater damage to public

281
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:04,740
health than fat tissue itself. When the focus is on weight and body size it's not obesity that

282
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,340
damages people, it's fear mongering about their bodies that puts them at risk for diabetes,

283
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:15,020
heart disease, discrimination, bullying, eating disorders, sedentariness, lifelong discomfort in

284
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,620
their bodies and even early death. Really, so it's fear mongering about their bodies that cause all

285
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,980
this shit. Not being so fat that you look like a naked chicken. The data refutes long standing,

286
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:31,900
widespread and incorrect notions about health and weight. Like the fact that fat is a primary

287
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:37,700
driver in metabolic disease or that weight loss prolongs life or improves health. None of this

288
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:44,580
is true. Meanwhile, next fucking paragraph, it is true that many diseases are more commonly found

289
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:54,340
in heavier people. However, that doesn't mean that weight itself causes disease. Blaming fatness for

290
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,820
heart disease is similar to blaming yellow teeth for lung cancer rather than considering that

291
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:05,620
smoking might play a role in both. Okay, so we will get into the science of this a little bit

292
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:11,780
later but I just want you to keep this article in mind when we do, okay? Oh god, look at the

293
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:18,580
header for this article. Fat is not a bad word. For me, fat is a way of saying fuck you. No matter how

294
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:25,380
people use it, fat is not a bad word. Fat is not an indication of value, health, beauty or performance.

295
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:32,100
Fat is a descriptor in the same way that black and queer are descriptors and fat is somewhat similar

296
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,220
to black and queer in more than just that way. It's a word that encompasses a marginalized

297
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,940
identity. Okay, so hold on a second, hold on a second. I gotta parse this properly here, okay?

298
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:49,940
It's a marginalized identity so you're identifying as fat. Well, unlike black and for the most part

299
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:56,500
unlike queer, you can just lose the weight and I mean presumably you're not going to be like a

300
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:05,380
trans fat where you identify as skinny while you're fat or vice versa. Trans fat? Yeah dude.

301
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:17,220
How fat is weaponized and the reclaiming of the word goes beyond size. Fat stigma is also tied to

302
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:23,940
anti-blackness in that being black is the abundance that white supremacy seeks to shrink. What?

303
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:24,840
How?

304
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:36,900
So, does this mean that being a fat white guy, I'm no longer a white supremacist? Am I black

305
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:44,420
now? Am I part of the abundance? My definition of fat is black as fuck, multi-dimensional

306
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:49,700
and futuristic. I don't know, I don't know how futuristic. It might not last another five years.

307
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:57,780
Fat means I exist. Fat means taking up space and demanding more. Fat means black. Fat means fuck

308
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:03,540
you. Fat means human. Fat means creating a world full of possibility without shame.

309
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,700
Fat means saying fuck you. It honestly sounds like the way that she writes it, fat means being

310
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,900
a colonizer. Like you know how you see those pictures of like the really fat guy in a suit

311
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:19,220
and it's like the capitalist and he just has like a ton of money and he's huge and like the

312
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,980
working class is like a skeleton like just barely scraping by on like one coin. So when this person

313
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:32,260
says fat means taking up space and demanding more, they're literally just like I want to be

314
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:39,060
the oppressor class. How to have sex with a fat girl. Touch, and I cannot stress this enough,

315
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,780
the fupa, this this picture.

316
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:52,580
Hold on, what's a fupa? I don't know if I want to know. The fat upper pubic area.

317
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:05,220
What? Oh my god, it's it's it's the gun. That's what it is. It's like that second stomach that

318
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:12,420
kind of comes out in front of the pubic region. The first the first few times I fucked as a fat

319
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:19,860
girl I exclusively wore my boyfriend's superman hoodie to hide my body. I was 16, a size 14 and

320
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:27,380
it was 2009. Long before body positivity hit the mainstream or my tumblr feed. Now as a 26 year

321
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:33,700
old woman wearing a size 20, sex has changed year after year as my body has gotten bigger and the

322
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:40,340
dating pool has gotten smaller. With plus size partners, we can press our bellies together,

323
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:47,620
grab each other's bodies and enjoy the thickness of our flesh in privacy. Touch the fupa.

324
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:55,300
It's a universal truth known by fat girls that the fupa is the most intimidating part of our body.

325
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:02,260
I know this because my fupa has been touched so little that I'm surprised she hasn't shriveled up

326
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:11,220
and fallen off. The hottest the hottest hookups are the ones that grab my belly like it's a third

327
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:17,620
tit. Kiss the flesh on the way down to the kitty and aren't pretending my body is less than it is.

328
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,100
There's a lot of things I regret. I think at this point you kind of know where where all this is

329
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:36,180
going. Diet culture and weight loss programs are a scam. Plus sized elf makes a joke of women's

330
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:43,540
bodies. Two fat professors are afraid of COVID-19 causing fat phobia. Speaking about health is

331
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:50,100
traumatizing for some who are impacted negatively by diet culture. Dear men, stop working out.

332
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,740
Physical fitness creates a cycle of toxic masculinity that must be eradicated.

333
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:01,460
On thinner bodies the strawberry TikTok dress skews a tiny bit fascist. I don't even need to

334
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,100
like read the content of these articles. I'm pretty sure at this point you can just imagine

335
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:13,220
what they say and you'll be right. The only way to be a proper BIPOC ally, to be anti-capitalist,

336
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:18,980
anti-fascist is to simply be more abundantly obese. Everything in this video is factually

337
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:22,420
correct by the way and if you disagree you simply haven't done enough research on the history of

338
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:29,540
fatness. Stay mad. I don't know how much work I can take but fine. The obesity epidemic isn't

339
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,380
real and it shouldn't be an anti-capitalist talking point. When someone unironically

340
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,380
references the obesity epidemic or even uses the word obesity it tells me they really don't know

341
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,980
what they're talking about when it comes to fatness. This use of the word obesity stems

342
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,540
directly from the BMI which was created by a eugenicist with no medical training who based

343
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:51,140
the scale only on white bodies and cow math. Fatness is not an epidemic. Fat people existed

344
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:56,260
before capitalism and before colonization. Fatphobia is a direct result of anti-blackness

345
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,260
and it has deadly consequences for many groups of indigenous folks and other people of color

346
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:05,460
as well as fat folks. When you make the obesity epidemic a real symptom of capitalism you are not

347
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,020
only ostracizing fat people from anti-capitalist thinking but also actively ignoring that the

348
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:15,220
health outcomes related to obesity are more accurately attributed to food deserts and

349
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,260
fatphobic discrimination in healthcare. The obesity epidemic was created by western medicine

350
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,900
to avoid addressing the actual causes of health inequity which is what we as anti-capitalists

351
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:33,380
should be doing. I would have to like spend the entire day talking about just how many things

352
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:41,220
are wrong in this video. Not only factually but like viscerally. But let's focus on the

353
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,220
food deserts thing because that's an important point and that leads us to the next topic of

354
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:50,020
discussion and considering that we are currently talking about the wider political tent that

355
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:55,780
constantly says trust the science believe the scientists there should be no objection to

356
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,300
talking about science right? Because as it turns out that is not what happens with food desertification.

357
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:07,700
Now what a food desert is is an area in like a large city where there's no grocery store so

358
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,260
there's no place to actually buy fresh food you can only go to restaurants and fast food places

359
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,300
and in places like that. But as reported on from the wall street journal what happens when new

360
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,500
supermarkets open in food deserts? Not what you think. For years public health advocates have

361
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,820
argued that food deserts neighborhoods without grocery stores or other fresh food vendors

362
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:32,020
contribute to a disproportionate burden of obesity and chronic disease among low-income individuals.

363
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:37,940
Ready access to fresh healthy food intuitively seems important for supporting a healthy diet

364
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,540
but recent evidence contests the idea that watering america's food deserts will solve the obesity

365
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:49,780
crisis. Compared with high-income individuals poor americans tend to have diets higher in sugar

366
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:57,700
fat and processed foods and lower in fiber fruits and vegetables. This nutritional inequality is a

367
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,980
contributor to the large income-based health disparities in the us and is thought to be due

368
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:08,420
in part to more limited access to healthy food. But does introducing a supermarket into a food

369
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,900
desert change the grocery habits of nearby residents? Not so much according to a recent

370
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:19,140
study. Researchers found that less than one-tenth of the nutritional inequality between high and

371
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:26,100
low-income households can be explained by the availability of healthy foods. The other 90% was

372
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:34,260
due to differences in demand. So even when you give people who are overweight the option to buy

373
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:39,620
healthy food they still don't do it. It's more than simply living in the ghetto and not having

374
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:45,060
access. It is a deeper problem than that. This is fucking ridiculous. People aren't obese because

375
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:51,380
there's junk food advertisements on before nine o'clock. People are obese because a pack of 20%

376
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:58,740
fat mincemeat is $3.95 and a pack of 5% fat is $5.79. People are obese because a pack of biscuits

377
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:05,540
is 20 pence and a pack of apples is two pounds. The actual problem seems to be a lack of knowledge

378
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:13,140
about how diets work. Dietary fat does not equate into body fat. In fact you're much more likely to

379
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,860
gain body fat from eating carbohydrates than you are from eating dietary fat and even then

380
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:24,260
it's based more on how many calories you burn. How much exercise you're doing is calories in

381
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:30,020
calories out. That's how it works. Your body does not violate the laws of thermodynamics.

382
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:36,740
You are actually better off buying that pack of 20% fat meat over the 5% fat as long as you're

383
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:43,140
also not eating an entire loaf of bread a day. The problem is sugar, it's carbs, it's gluten. That shit

384
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:49,140
is just empty calories with no nutritional value that just makes you hungrier. And people just don't

385
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:55,060
want to hear this even though it's the truth. Outrage as Whole Foods CEO says ignorance and

386
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:01,540
poor choices cause obesity. It's the truth dude. Overweight and healthy is a big fat lie.

387
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,940
Our findings refute the notion that a physically active lifestyle can completely negate the

388
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,780
deleterious effects of being overweight and obesity. You cannot be fat and healthy at the

389
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:18,340
same time. Even a fat person who you know lifts weights and runs and does all those things but is

390
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:23,620
still fat they would be much healthier without all the body fat. In fact check this out check this out

391
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:28,980
skinny jeans are the secret to staying slim. Oh shit is it all actually just genetics?

392
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,100
Researchers found that people who were obese were more likely to have a set of genes linked to being

393
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:40,180
overweight. Meanwhile people who were skinny not only had fewer genes linked to obesity

394
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:47,700
but also changes in gene regions newly associated with healthy thinness. So of course as with

395
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:53,220
everything in the human condition there is a genetic biological component. But I guarantee you

396
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,700
take the obese person with obese genes and throw them under the wild and just have them

397
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:03,860
starve they'll get thin. In fact a professor of nutrition and dietetics professor Tom Sanders

398
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:09,060
said this is an important study confirming that precocious severe obesity is often genetically

399
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:14,740
determined. But he also added most obesity is acquired in adult life and is linked to the

400
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:19,460
environment we live in. A sedentary lifestyle and abundant access to calorie dense foods.

401
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:25,460
Whatever your shape or genetic makeup the age-old advice of a healthy level of exercise and good

402
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:32,100
diet still stands. This is an article that fat activists constantly cite and they've only ever

403
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,500
read the headline and this is why you get shit like this. Does obesity really not cause any

404
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:42,980
health problems? I never knew. What I say what we always say is that being fat is not proven to

405
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:49,220
cause any illness only correlated with and that correlation is not causation is a basic principle

406
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,500
of science. However many of the illnesses that are correlated with fatness are proven to cause

407
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,220
weight gain or medications to treat them are. We also point out that there is no such thing as an

408
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,500
illness that only fat people get. This is the problem with scientism and I'm going to have to do

409
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:11,380
a video on science versus scientism at some point but basically if you have already ideologically

410
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:16,660
predetermined your end point then you simply pick and choose all of the science that leads you there

411
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,860
and ignore all the science that disagrees with you. Case in point fat sex therapist

412
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:28,260
compares fitness trainers to nazis children dieting to sexual assault. I truly believe

413
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,460
that a child cannot consent to being on a diet the same way a child cannot consent to having sex

414
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:40,020
says Sonali Rashatwar who attends Saint Olaf College. Rashatwar also believes that science

415
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:45,460
is white supremacist. We should be critical of the use of science and the production of knowledge

416
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,740
to continue promoting this idea that certain bodies are fit able and desirable. Is it my

417
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:56,660
fatness that causes my high blood pressure? Yes. Or is it my experience of weight stigma? It's

418
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,380
definitely your fatness. She then connected the science suggesting that obesity is unhealthy to

419
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:09,460
nazism saying that fat phobic science is often actually eugenic science. Eugenic science is nazi

420
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:20,180
science. You know you can say the most unscientific shit but simply use a few of the

421
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:26,900
words that some scientists have used in the past and then squint your eyes to make it real fuzzy

422
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:32,340
and then it kind of seems scientific. Even when it comes to modern problems like the coronavirus

423
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:37,220
COVID-19 death rates are 10 times higher in countries where most adults are overweight.

424
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,420
There is a link between whether or not you're going to die of coronavirus and if you are fat.

425
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:49,620
I am fat. To get the vaccine I had to say I'm obese. This word has done incredible damage to

426
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:55,060
my body. No, the damage was probably done by the fourth Big Mac you had that day. I understand that

427
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:00,580
doctors are including obese. Did you censor obesity? Oh my god. I understand that doctors

428
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:06,660
are including obesity as an underlying medical condition that leads to death in COVID patients.

429
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,740
Do these doctors have any idea what kind of impact this has on families to be told that

430
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,740
their loved one's body shape is partly to blame for their death? The impact doesn't matter. It

431
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:20,020
matters the truth. If you die because you're too fat it doesn't matter like the impact it has on

432
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,580
your on your family. What matters is that you were too fat and you died because you were too fat.

433
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,860
Furthermore when it comes to obesity and COVID deaths we have no evidence of causation and only

434
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:34,900
a weak association that continues to be disproven as times goes by. No it doesn't. What are these

435
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:40,340
junior doctors thinking? Give me one good reason for recording fatness as a cause of death. Well

436
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:49,460
causes of death as we've seen recently with George Floyd and other have been very politicized as of

437
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,740
late and I for one am happy to see someone actually telling the truth on these forms.

438
00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:00,020
What I've managed to pull from all of this though is that these people are screeching about fat

439
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:06,180
acceptance from all possible angles. Cultural, scientific, representation, ideological,

440
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,860
they're using politics, they're using critical theory, they're using socialist theory,

441
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:16,740
they're using post-colonial theory, they're using everything that they can to basically turn fat and

442
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:22,900
thin into another variation of white and non-white or something like that to create more classes and

443
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:29,540
have them clash you know Marxist style. But the honest truth is when it comes to other alternative

444
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:35,300
body types among the broader left there seems to be like a serious hit and miss right? White

445
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:41,780
people calling fully grown Asian women cute is racist. No I will not explain. It's infantilizing

446
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:48,660
as hell. Yeah I'm tired. I'd rather just be called ugly at this point. All right you're ugly.

447
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:54,340
Aquaman looks hot because men want to be him. Carol Marcus looks hot because men want to fuck

448
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,260
her. I don't even know who this guy is I keep seeing him on twitter and he seems to be like

449
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:04,580
a grade-a moron. But dude dude do you see are you seriously saying that women don't want to

450
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:09,780
fuck Jason Momoa? Lizzo, who the fuck is Lizzo? You know who cares? Lizzo talks about double

451
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:14,420
standards for critiquing men's bodies versus women's. We don't talk about your dick sizes do we?

452
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:23,860
13 male celebs with seriously big bulges. Cosmopolitan confirmed. Men who objectify

453
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:29,620
women are effing horrible. Also cosmopolitan. 36 summer olympic bulges that deserve gold.

454
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:36,260
How many times how many fucking times has there been like height shaming for men? I've done like

455
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:42,020
a whole height shame video in the past and like you know dick size shaming. Even when the guy in

456
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:47,460
question is tall and probably has like an average or even slightly above average dick size they'll

457
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,300
simply throw that out there if they don't like what he's saying. It's like oh you like the wrong

458
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,380
politics, you like the wrong sports teams, like the wrong video games, have the wrong opinions

459
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,700
online, make fun of the wrong thing, make the wrong joke, whatever. Oh you're probably short

460
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:05,620
and you have a tiny dick. Dude this shit happens everywhere and sometimes it's funny right like

461
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:10,580
you see a guy who has like 10 guns or he has like a giant truck and it's like that guy's compensating

462
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:17,540
hahaha like it's a joke all right and it's fine it's allowed but don't act like it doesn't happen.

463
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:22,660
Do you recall Beachbody Ready? This was I think 2016 or something it was a while ago

464
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:28,900
where London mayor Sadiq Khan banned this shit because it was apparently objectifying because

465
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:33,140
it was a woman who was in shape and very clearly worked to get in shape. It was it was like a

466
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:37,460
protein powder weight loss advertisement and everyone was like how dare you! On February

467
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:44,420
10th of 2020 Sadiq Khan was proud to announce on his official twitter the Nubian skin advertisement

468
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:50,740
which was just like an underwear advertisement and you'll notice it's four plus size women and

469
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:56,900
two dudes with rippling abs. Where's the representation? Where's the outcry? The whole

470
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:05,060
body positive argument falls apart as soon as you see how the left treats people with alternative

471
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:10,980
body types when one they're not fat they're extremely skinny or they're in some other way

472
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:18,820
different or two they're not leftists. It is extremely telling to me that when radical

473
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:24,500
feminist male female whatever doesn't matter when they write about what looks are outdated

474
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:30,660
or sexist or toxic it's always traditionally attractive people men and women alike and when

475
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:36,900
they write about what's actually sexy amazing stunning brave and what should be pined after

476
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:43,780
it just so happens to be how they look and it's generally kind of hideous and then when they bump

477
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:50,020
into somebody who is in some way hideous in the exact way that they've written about but does not

478
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:55,620
share their politics maybe they have some problem that is not socially acceptable to admit like you

479
00:47:55,620 --> 00:48:00,180
can go online and say you have all sorts of different mental problems but if you know if

480
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,700
you're actually an incel like if you're someone who can't get a girlfriend and you're like depressed

481
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,820
about it and you feel like the world's out to get you you're kind of on the lowest rung or the totem

482
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:12,020
pole when it comes to men yeah body positivity doesn't apply to them body positivity doesn't

483
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:18,340
apply to say short men or thin women or women who have suffered from anorexia or bulimia the rules

484
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:25,700
that have been set out in this video are only valid if it helps that intersectional lefty cause

485
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:30,980
which is why at least to me it seems like a big old bunch of bullshit and that being said whenever

486
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:37,540
i see somebody demand something regarding body positivity i just laugh at them because i know

487
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,860
that they're living hypocrites i'm still going to tell the same jokes i'm still going to laugh at

488
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:47,140
the same things you're still going to be ridiculous when you complain that the new resident evil game

489
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,620
has a fat guy and they're like how dare you link fatness with gluttony and it's like you do that

490
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:56,580
every time you complain about capitalism and post a caricature so you know what i'm willing to bet

491
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:00,900
that if you're actually out here talking about body positivity you're just a fucking hypocrite

492
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,700
and there is no reason anyone should believe you and if you want to actually be body positive

493
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:10,500
then encourage people to self-improve help the fat person at your local gym

494
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,700
tell them they can make it because you know what we're all gonna make it bros for real
