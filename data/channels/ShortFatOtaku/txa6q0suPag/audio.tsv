0	10640	If there's one trend that I'm really enjoying right now, it's the posting their L's accounts.
10640	16500	E-boys posting their L's. E-girls posting their L's. Think tanks posting their L's.
16500	21660	Coomers posting their L's. But the one that I like most of all, and probably the only one that
21660	29020	I can intersectionally talk about myself, is fat people posting their L's. And yes, being a person
29080	35720	of size myself, I am in fact allowed to do this video topic. Nobody else can. None of you thin
35720	42100	people, otherwise known as thiggers, can in fact do this. Only we fats can, understand? I just want
42100	48600	to point out before we begin, this is definitely a video where we laugh and chuckle. It's less
48600	53080	about the point, even though there will be a point at the end. It's less about the point and more
53080	58760	about the fun. So let's go. I would rather be out here celebrating and finding peace with our
58760	65180	magical bodies rather than projecting our own insecurities. Edit. Actually, it would be nice
65180	69920	if people could just mind their own fucking business. I love the use of the black emojis.
69920	74960	I use them all the time too. Honestly, take the time to try and decolonize your mind instead of
74960	79860	sucking the joy out of fat pussy love. Man, we're starting off strong. I don't even know, like, am I
79860	86100	allowed to show you this? Because like, that looks like it might be the vagina, but I can't tell.
86100	89760	Actually, I can't, you know what, looking at it now, I can't even tell what side of the person
89760	95880	we're looking at. It's diabetes and coronary artery disease. Can you rephrase that in body
95880	102840	positive terms? Okay, I'll give it a shot. You're so brave and fabulous that your pancreas and heart
102840	109640	can't keep up. Oh yeah, I remember this. I remember this from back during, I think, the release of
109640	115920	Smash 4 when Sakurai added the Wii Fit Trainer character. Looks like I won't be buying Super
115920	120860	Smash Bros since Nintendo apparently supports fat shaming, as seen by the inclusion of the
120860	126660	whitewashed embodiment of thin privilege herself, the Wii Fit Trainer. Okay, so for those of you who
126660	133340	don't know, basically on the Wii they had a balance board. You could stand on it, do exercises with
133340	140220	it. It was a pretty good casual game. There was a lot of like yoga and stuff, but the actual mascot
140220	144940	of the game was this mannequin-looking woman who would move around and do the yoga with you and
144960	149680	show you how to do it. I mean, she's very clearly not like a white person. She's a white mannequin.
149680	156640	Like she's just like pure eggshell white, you know? But even back then, back when Wii Fit came
156640	162520	out, which was what, 2008 or something, people were complaining that Nintendo was being fat
162520	168160	phobic for releasing the game. After the horrifying fiasco that was Microsoft's conference yesterday
168160	173560	where a woman was literally raped for losing a round of killer instinct. Oh yeah, I remember
173620	181620	this. This was like, what, 2012, 2013's E3? Check out this clip, guys. This is gonna get interesting.
181620	184980	For those of you who don't know, Torin's the producer for Killer Instinct, and he's brought
184980	188700	out the new tournament edition, Mad Catz Fight Stick, which will be available at the launch
188700	197140	of Killer Instinct. Good luck, Ashton. Come on, Ashton, bring it. Whoever thought it was a good
197140	202060	idea that I play against a producer is gonna get it. Come on, you gotta practice before you get on
202060	208600	stage in front of millions of people. I can't even block correctly, and you're too fast. There
208600	215760	we go. Just let it happen, it'll be over soon. You have a fight stick! Man, if this happened
215760	222280	like E3 2020 or 2021, there would be such an outrage mob, but back then it was just laughed
222280	228480	about on 4chan. Obese woman was arrested for starving her seven kids. There was only enough
228500	232620	food for me. Look at the fucking picture, look at this woman and look at those kids. They're
232620	237240	like skeletons, dude, they're like Ethiopian level. A disturbing report is coming out of
237240	243620	Louisiana this morning that tells the story of 27-year-old Lakisha Connors, who reportedly
243620	248220	starved her children nearly to death. Mother of seven was arrested on Thursday evening when
248220	253780	neighbors called police and said they saw extremely unhealthy looking children digging
253780	258640	through the trash cans on the side yard. When police arrived and knocked on the door,
258640	263920	they were greeted by three-year-old Ammonette Connors and five-year-old Dante Connors who
263920	267820	let them into the home. Authorities say they found the mother passed out on the couch. What
267820	274360	the actual fuck? Okay, we can tell by the size of this woman, there's clearly more than enough
274360	279720	food going around. The kids could literally eat their mother and be fine for a few years here,
280020	287400	sometimes we eat, sometimes we don't. Yeah, press X to doubt. Oh God,
287400	295220	do you even want to read this story? Let's talk accessibility. I'm an infini-fat. You're
295220	301560	infinitely fat, meaning I wear plus 30 clothing in the UK and many shops don't carry that. I use
301560	305740	the disabled toilet because that's what I need to do, but they're still not very fat friendly.
305740	310240	Things are put as close together as possible, giving me no space to wipe myself. Oh God,
310240	316880	I'm luckily flexible and do what I call a wipe yoga. I have to take off my bottoms and often
316880	325080	one shoe to be able to place my leg on the wall or something else to balance on to wipe. Imagine
325080	330480	letting yourself get so fat that you have to do yoga to reach your asshole. This can be a
330480	334760	workout. I'm panting, shaking, and starting to feel rubbish afterwards. Well, you do need a
334780	339860	workout, but I do need the toilet sometimes like all humans do. In the UK, they like to lock the
339860	343980	damn doors for a disabled user. You have to hunt down a person with the key. It's exhausting,
343980	348380	and this time I'm at the National Museum in Cardiff and the bloody toilets are down a flight
348380	353420	of stairs. The lift doesn't work. I can and do walk up and down stairs, but people who can't,
353420	360060	it's bullshit. And then they, what was it? They had some Arby's. You might be thinking Arby's,
360120	366160	but you probably shouldn't be eating it if you're having to do wipe yoga. How do you poo?
366160	380700	I weigh nearly 600 pounds now, so I have to sit down, but not on the toilet because it would
380700	386360	break. I use a beanbag chair as my toilet because when I sit on it, it creates a kind of space in
386420	392180	the middle with surrounding walls. So when I shit, the fecal matter spreads around me,
392180	399980	but doesn't overflow. Then I scoop the shit into the toilet, usually flushing four or five times
399980	405700	to get it all down. It fucking sucks because I use the same beanbag for general sitting,
405700	418040	and it's starting to smell. Don't get fat, bros. I've tried shitting into a mini fridge
418040	424540	that has been turned on so the cold would cause the shit to condense its moisture and make it
424540	432800	easier to flush, but it wasn't comfortable. I can just imagine this fat whoa jack here holding a
432820	440140	full-ass mini fridge directly up to his asshole and filling it with shit. They sent my OnlyFans
440140	450200	content to my fans. Is this a real video? There's no way this woman... Oh my God, it's real.
462800	466340	I have feelings when it comes to my OnlyFans, and you guys are probably like,
466340	475220	just quit fucking talking about it. I have to because I'll just explain. So for me,
475220	482840	I'm trying to break the stigma that that girls are too big or too impulsive or too overweight
482840	492780	to have sex because just like our appetites, sex can be a bit ravenous too. Is that why you
492780	498020	have the tusks? Good God the comments on this video were unreal. Hey Wendy's, my overweight
498020	502520	friend and her adult daughters went to your Toledo store. Richard at the counter, who had
502520	507620	never met them before, had said the usual. My friend says, what are you talking about? Richard
507620	515120	says two of everything. She doesn't even want her lunch now she's crying. I always knew Wendy's
515120	523200	was based, but damn. Mum who spent 93 pounds to travel 82 miles for Tinder date called fat and
523200	531800	then dumped. That's rough. Tinder's a rough place to be anyway. The pair had met a few times before
531800	536880	and she was chatting to him on the phone when she arrived. She explained, that's when he said,
537140	542740	fuck me, you've put on some weight, haven't you? I was like, no, you can't say that. Hold on,
542740	547660	hold on, hold on, hold on. So if you haven't put on the weight, you just say, no, I haven't. Like
547660	552260	if there's some kind of like miscommunication or he misremembers or something, but she doesn't even
552260	561660	deny it, she just says it, you can't say that to me. And she started a GoFundMe to get her
561660	567920	90 pounds back because her date called her fat. I just want to make my 90 pounds travel money back
567920	572800	so I can buy wine and sticks of lard. There are like a billion funny stories like that,
572800	578920	but as you keep digging just beyond the surface level humor, being to realize there's actually
578920	585800	like a fat positivity movement or something. Dear my skinny friends, what are you actively
585940	590940	doing to unlearn the gaze that renders fat folks unattractive? Now you can see this is,
590940	597980	this is already steeped in that intersectionalist language where it's, it's unlearn rather than
597980	602460	something being innate like attraction or it's, it's a gaze like the male gaze. You know,
602460	607040	this is the anti-fat gaze that apparently we all have when we're not attracted to a fat person.
607040	612300	It's strange because we accept sexual orientation as being an immutable characteristic, right? This
612320	617960	idea that you can't really change who you're attracted to. And yet when it comes to like in
617960	621560	the super straight video, being attracted to trans people or being attracted to fat people,
621560	627200	like, like in this video, uh, now it's something that needs to be unlearned. Imagine telling a gay
627200	632340	person to unlearn their attraction. See how far that would get you. Dear friends with bodies of
632340	638720	normalized sizes. See, even the way, like I could just pick apart every single sentence here because
638820	642100	I kind of, I've been reading a lot of books on intersectionality and critical theory,
642100	647620	and they, they phrase it this way so that rather than being fat is something that they've done to
647620	652520	themselves, whether that through diet, lack of exercise, even if they have some kind of medical
652520	657320	condition that makes them more prone to put on weight, they haven't managed it well, rather than
657320	662540	it being any of those things. It is something that society has pushed on them. It's external.
662540	667760	So rather than being thin or making themselves thin or keeping themselves thin, your average
667780	676740	person has bodies of normalized sizes. See this now passive that sounds how it's simply society's
676740	682100	fault that those sizes are normalized. And that's the only issue we're dealing with here. Let's stop
682100	688300	pretending that our non desires are simply preferences and not culturally informed. So,
688300	694220	okay. Literally the argument that Christians gave against gay marriage got it. Or as if they were
694220	700940	just a given fact that one can't influence. If your idea of body positivity stops at simply not
700940	708200	actively shaming fat folks, I call it doesn't go far enough. Okay. So if you're not having sex with
708200	715220	the fat person, then you are oppressive. Suck the fat roll bigot. This whole thing honestly
715220	720840	reads like it was written by an incel. As queers, we've left the heteronormative desirability matrix,
720960	725280	but what about the other norms that determine who's hot and who's not, including those within
725280	730440	our own communities, hand on heart? How many of the people you had a crush on were fat? How many
730440	735920	are your partners? Are the people you swipe right on Tinder, message on OkCupid or flirt with at the
735920	742800	club, mainly thin people, masculine presenting, able bodied and white? We are literally at the
742800	748840	policing other people's consent stage of radical intersectionality because a lot of these broadly
749040	754320	radical left ideas require violating people's consent. If you're a socialist, you have to
754320	759120	violate the consent of people who own property, or even if they don't own property, they don't
759120	764280	want their labor collectivized. If you're an intersectionalist, you have to violate people's
764280	769000	consent in this way. It no longer matters if you choose X. If that's an oppressive choice,
769000	775520	your consent doesn't matter anymore. Consent is basically a modern expression of the older liberal
775560	780640	conception of natural rights, and the left's historic materialists have already given up
780640	784800	the idea of natural rights. And yeah, we've already reached the point too where they have
784800	793040	to basically go actively hunting for microaggressions. Fellow fats, fellow fats,
793040	799440	what's something that's not explicitly anti-fat, but you experience as anti-fatness? For example,
799440	803160	when thin friends only seem to want to process their body insecurities with you,
803680	808840	their fattest friend, talking to you at length about food addiction, etc. I've noticed that
808840	813960	people feel really entitled to my time and help. I get approached a lot with people asking for
813960	818720	directions, where something is, if I know which train someone needs to get on, etc. etc. So yeah,
818720	823760	yeah, we're at the point where asking someone directions is fatphobia. Of course, these things
823760	828960	intersect in strange ways, don't they? Men who don't wear jackets in cold weather do so with
828960	834280	the express intent of intimidating women and to make women feel like lesser beings. If you see
834280	839200	a man who is not wearing a jacket when you're cold, then call him out on his toxic masculinity
839200	845240	and his ego violence. Yeah, well, you know what sentient Jessica? What if that man is just really,
845240	849280	really fat and therefore the cold doesn't really affect them at all? Like they have all that extra
849280	854320	blubber to insulate things. Are you going to be fatphobic and call them out then? Why are men
854560	860840	larger than women? It makes no evolutionary sense for women to be smaller, because everything from
860840	866720	birthing children to surviving predators would be easier if we were the same size as men. So why are
866720	873480	we smaller? Because men have starved women of food for untold generations to ensure their own
873480	879440	survival. A smaller body means women can survive with less food and have more to share with their
879440	884880	children because with men around, both mother and child are going to get less of everything. So
884880	890120	smaller women were more likely to survive a time of famine and therefore we have evolved to become
890120	897040	smaller so we can survive men's greed. This sounds very anti-fat to me. In fact, it sounds like you're
897040	904920	saying a fat person's fatness is based not on an immutable characteristic, but on diet. How dare
904920	911520	you? This asexual TikToker has a message for haters. Alright, let's check it out. My name is
911520	923200	Steven McHale and I identify as asexual. Don't worry buddy, the feeling is mutual. That's the
923200	928320	thing, a lot of asexuality is caused by being ridiculously overweight to the point that the
928320	936280	sex drive plummets and I think there's definitely some kind of overlap between people rigidly
936280	941480	demanding that asexuality be accepted and fair enough, if you're asexual, like whatever, right?
941480	948560	But the fact that there is a overlap between that and being very unhealthy, I have a feeling that if
948560	954680	most asexuals, not all, but if most asexuals got a handle on their health, they probably wouldn't be
954680	961800	asexuals anymore. Keto is racist. Sargon, Sargon, I didn't know you were this kind of a person. I
961800	968400	can't prove it, but just gives me white supremacy vibes. To be honest, any diet or anything that
968400	972920	promotes weight loss is oppressive. I rest my case, your honor. This tweet was a joke when I
972920	978080	was half asleep, but since y'all want to get into it, let's do it, okay? First, keto was originally
978080	982840	created to treat patients who had epilepsy and somehow white women co-opted it into a weight
982880	990120	loss diet, so it's ableist. Diet culture and fat phobia are rooted in racism and white supremacy.
990120	997000	Any diet or restrictive eating that alters your body from its natural state is racist. The beauty
997000	1003960	model, hold the fuck on, wait, wait, wait, wait a second, alters your body from its natural state.
1003960	1010080	Does this mean that every single trans person is racist? The beauty model most wanted to achieve
1010120	1016440	is a colonized goal. We have to decolonize the way we should let our body be and grow. So,
1016440	1023240	when trans people take hormones or surgically alter their body, it's racism? There is a coup
1023240	1029320	going on in the New York Times Cooking Community Facebook group. Here's the scoop. A member posted
1029320	1033560	about making sure to vote, and the moderators removed his post since the group is supposed
1033560	1039240	to be a haven from politics focused only on food. Judging by your avatar, you too are focused only
1039440	1045240	on food. The members, numbering over 62,000, weren't having it and made it clear that food
1045240	1051600	is undoubtedly political. They began to fashion food to spell vote using captions only directly
1051600	1057800	related to food. Bottom line, food is political. Food can be used to build community, change lives,
1057800	1065200	feed the hungry, inspire creativity, and it could also be easily squandered. Use your voice and your
1065240	1071960	food to inspire change. Do you think you could change your diet? Hot tip. Posting weight loss
1071960	1078360	photos shows us which bodies you value, no matter how body positive your caption sounds. If you
1078360	1083240	don't want us to believe thinner is better, then stop reinforcing that message under the guise of
1083240	1091120	self-love. That's right, my friends. Weight loss progress is ableist, or fatphobic, or racist,
1091120	1095040	or whatever the fuck. And that's actually been a really common thing for people to say the past
1095040	1099760	few years. Remember when, um, what's that one singer's name? I forget her name, she was a fat
1099760	1104400	singer and she lost all of her weight. And people were just like descending on her like, how dare
1104400	1109640	you post the fact that you lost all your fat and now you look like a regular person. It's like,
1109640	1114160	geez dude, like are you, are you so jealous that you haven't lost your own weight yet that you're
1114160	1120160	gonna just shit on everyone who is trying to live healthier and self-improve. Buying plus-size
1120200	1125560	clothing from thrift stores you can tailor the items down to your size zero body isn't a cute
1125560	1131960	YouTube video idea. It's fatphobic and classist and taking resources away from poor fat people
1131960	1137800	who have an infinitely harder time finding clothes than you do. Okay, so do not buy clothes that
1137800	1142840	aren't your size. Got it. Can we also apply this to fat people who still think that they fit into
1142840	1147640	like their high school clothing and are walking around in stuff that is like obviously too tight
1147680	1153040	and nobody wants to see that. I just ran an entire mile in nine minutes and 26 seconds.
1153040	1159440	I used to weigh 363 pounds and now I'm running a mile in under 10 minutes. Congratulations. You,
1159440	1164200	you, you, you, you. Why did so many of my mutuals I thought were body positive like this? Bye.
1164200	1170680	You're literally just jealous and bitter that this person has gotten into shape and is now
1170680	1176680	like running. I thought you were body positive. Like really, you don't think that like an athlete's
1176720	1182960	body is something also worthy of being positive towards? Just say no to transformation Tuesday.
1182960	1188000	Whether you're trying to depict your weight loss or weight gain, these pics aren't helpful.
1188000	1194560	Preliminary research, God, you're always with these appeals. Preliminary research has shown
1194560	1200080	that exposure to transformation pictures of any kind of social media increases negative body image
1200080	1204240	and self-objectification. When it comes down to it, these types of images promote physical
1204240	1209360	comparisons. They promote fat phobia when depicting weight loss. When depicting weight gain,
1209360	1213400	they promote competition and feelings of not being sick enough among the recovery community.
1213400	1220280	Just say no to transformation pics. Literally hide me from my own ideals that I don't feel bad.
1220280	1226840	If you post a weight loss before and after pics, I will instantly unfollow you. It's triggering an
1226840	1233640	inherently fat phobic smooch. What you choose to do with your body is your business, but promoting
1233680	1238160	and celebrating weight loss is triggering for many people and is deeply entrenched in fat phobia.
1238160	1242320	What you're showing every fat person is that our bodies are something to hate,
1242320	1248320	something to celebrate becoming smaller. Diet culture is buried in capitalism and racism. I
1248320	1253880	am no longer gently asking people to educate themselves. Now is the time to examine every
1253880	1259200	way you make passes in your life with these violent systems. This also extends to the way
1259200	1264080	fitness culture has adopted body-positive language in ways that promote fat phobia
1264080	1268760	insidiously. Do what makes you feel good in your body, but the ways we celebrate our
1268760	1275760	bodies becoming smaller is still deeply entwined in fat phobia. Translation here is that the
1275760	1280280	ideology is more important than the reality. It doesn't matter about your health. It doesn't even
1280280	1286820	matter about how you feel. It doesn't matter about your goals. What matters is the ideology.
1286820	1291140	If you do something that is by all other objective metrics good for you,
1291140	1300980	if it's fat phobic, that's what matters. Junk food does not exist. I wish. Food is food. The
1300980	1305820	use of this language is generally to police fat people, but fat people have existed before that
1305820	1312180	language and will exist after it's long gone. Yeah dude, all of those starving kulaks, they
1312180	1318660	were like 600 pounds and they all died, eh? Is that how it was? Food is food. You need fats and
1318660	1324100	carbohydrates too. Well, not really carbohydrates, but you do need fats. Food is not healthy or
1324100	1331020	unhealthy. It's food. Railing against junk food or unhealthy food is hella anti-black, classist,
1331020	1335460	and anti-black. How is it anti-black? Food is motherfucking food. Food provides food
1335460	1340020	treatments. Food is good. So many people have such horrific relationships with food because
1340020	1344260	diet culture teaches us to. Imagine that everything you thought you knew about food
1344260	1350060	was taught on a white supremacist, capitalist, anti-black foundation because it was. Man,
1350060	1358780	like this is where the drive for ultimate equality leads us. Everything must be equal to every other
1358780	1365740	thing all the time. There is no difference between say eating a really greasy, fully loaded pizza and
1365740	1372420	a protein shake. It's all just food. Nutrients and macros and calories, none of that shit exists.
1372420	1380660	If it's all the same, why don't you just eat dirt? Casual fucking reminder that the white race
1380660	1387860	scientists invent, white race scientists. Race science, you guys. When they measure your waist,
1387860	1393100	it's like measuring your skull. All right, all right. Casual fucking reminder that white race
1393140	1400620	scientists invented fat phobia and the concept of obesity. If you are ever fat phobic or on some,
1400620	1405700	oh well fat is unhealthy, ooh, ooh bullshit, I hope you fucking know that someone's white
1405700	1414380	ancestor is smiling in their grave. You know, a show that was considered woke and radically left,
1414380	1422020	say 10, 15, I think almost even 20 years ago was the Boondocks. And in one of those episodes
1422060	1428900	of the Boondocks, grandpa opens a restaurant for soul food where they cook up, you know,
1428900	1434900	culturally relevant black foods, but they're also very, very unhealthy. And it turns out that the
1434900	1440060	reason that, you know, black people historically ate that way was because one, they were slaves,
1440060	1443420	they had to eat whatever they could get it, get their hands on. And two, because they were very
1443420	1450700	poor, even after slavery was abolished. And so this culture of cooking very unhealthy,
1450700	1457260	but very cheap foods and making them taste very good came about. And grandpa keeps serving this
1457260	1462100	food because he's black and it's part of his culture. And even though he's no longer poor,
1462100	1467180	the way that he was when he was young, still feels a cultural impetus to serve this food.
1467180	1473820	And of course people eat it and they fucking like fall asleep in the restaurant because it's just
1473820	1479500	so, you know, insulin overpowering. I'm pretty sure some even has like a heart attack in the
1479500	1483020	restaurant. I haven't seen the episode in years and years, so I don't know. But basically the
1483020	1490740	point is, is that even then, even in this woke lefty show, they said our ancestors ate this
1490740	1497420	stuff because they had to. And even though it is a cultural celebration, maybe we can also move past
1497420	1503020	it. Since then, instead of moving past it, they've decided to simply make being fat part of black
1503020	1508460	culture. All right. Plus sized women admit they aren't attracted to overweight men. Wait, wait,
1508460	1514220	wait a second. Why are the women plus sized and the men overweight as a plus sized woman? There's
1514220	1519260	this expectation that she'd only date overweight men. These women open up about dealing with the
1519260	1525140	stigma of being plus sized and refusing to settle and date overweight men. Well, hold on. Do you
1525140	1529980	think that like regular sized men should settle and date you? Like, why is it settling when you
1529980	1535620	do it, but not when they, what the fuck is this? Sometimes I feel guilty because I'm not attracted
1535620	1540860	to bigger guys, even though I'm plus size myself. I find it rare to find a big guy that takes care
1540860	1545540	of his appearance and hygiene the way I do. I'm a plus size woman, but I'm not attracted to big
1545540	1550460	guys. I get a lot of hate and criticism for that, but I can't help that I like average to muscular
1550460	1556980	types. Well, it sounds like you need to decolonize your thinking on this and become more attracted to
1556980	1562300	fat people. I'm plus size and I'm not attracted to really big guys. I've never been ruder me. It's
1562300	1566620	just not my thing. Everyone has a body they like to look at and overweight man is not one of mine.
1566620	1571860	I feel so hypocritical. I'm plus size and I'm not attracted to bigger guys. I only like average body
1571860	1576460	types. Not a ton of muscles, just average. I hate when people think I have to date bigger guys
1576460	1580900	because I'm plus sized. I can't help that I'm not attracted to them and I like muscular guys. Look
1580900	1587460	at all this colonized thinking. I can't help it. Yes, you can. Thinness ain't an accomplishment.
1587700	1593100	Weight loss ain't an accomplishment. I know y'all hate fat people and fatness so much. You believe
1593100	1596980	the size of your body should be can praise and congratulate it over. So now we've moved past
1596980	1602620	don't talk about your accomplishments into it's not even an accomplishment. This process is like
1602620	1609820	Yuri Bezmenov applied to fat people. Things have gotten so ridiculous that I think this is in the
1609820	1617320	UK. I'm pretty sure it's in the UK. There was a proposed law to make it illegal to alter your
1617320	1624780	online photos that you look thinner than you actually are. Tory MP Dr. Luke Evans said doctored
1624780	1631700	Instagram images are creating a warped view of beauty and fueling a mental health crisis. We
1631700	1636340	will monitor your social media and if it does not show you exactly as fat as we think you are,
1636500	1642860	we will fine you. And of course to go along with all these takes an entire industry of like,
1642860	1649620	I don't know how we'd even even call it like alternative science has appeared to fuel and
1649620	1656100	feed these people no pun intended. All of the reassurance that could ever possibly want. Fat
1656100	1662260	is not the problem. Fat stigma is. Health experts, notice how the word experts is in quotes this time
1662260	1666820	around when it goes against the narrative, are sending incorrect and destructive messages about
1666820	1673460	the relationship between weight and wellness. Are you sure? Obesity is the biggest threat to the
1673460	1678500	health of our nation. This all too common suggestion does far greater damage to public
1678500	1684740	health than fat tissue itself. When the focus is on weight and body size it's not obesity that
1684740	1689340	damages people, it's fear mongering about their bodies that puts them at risk for diabetes,
1689340	1695020	heart disease, discrimination, bullying, eating disorders, sedentariness, lifelong discomfort in
1695020	1700620	their bodies and even early death. Really, so it's fear mongering about their bodies that cause all
1700620	1705980	this shit. Not being so fat that you look like a naked chicken. The data refutes long standing,
1705980	1711900	widespread and incorrect notions about health and weight. Like the fact that fat is a primary
1711900	1717700	driver in metabolic disease or that weight loss prolongs life or improves health. None of this
1717700	1724580	is true. Meanwhile, next fucking paragraph, it is true that many diseases are more commonly found
1724580	1734340	in heavier people. However, that doesn't mean that weight itself causes disease. Blaming fatness for
1734340	1738820	heart disease is similar to blaming yellow teeth for lung cancer rather than considering that
1738820	1745620	smoking might play a role in both. Okay, so we will get into the science of this a little bit
1745620	1751780	later but I just want you to keep this article in mind when we do, okay? Oh god, look at the
1751780	1758580	header for this article. Fat is not a bad word. For me, fat is a way of saying fuck you. No matter how
1758580	1765380	people use it, fat is not a bad word. Fat is not an indication of value, health, beauty or performance.
1765940	1772100	Fat is a descriptor in the same way that black and queer are descriptors and fat is somewhat similar
1772100	1777220	to black and queer in more than just that way. It's a word that encompasses a marginalized
1777220	1781940	identity. Okay, so hold on a second, hold on a second. I gotta parse this properly here, okay?
1783220	1789940	It's a marginalized identity so you're identifying as fat. Well, unlike black and for the most part
1789940	1796500	unlike queer, you can just lose the weight and I mean presumably you're not going to be like a
1796500	1805380	trans fat where you identify as skinny while you're fat or vice versa. Trans fat? Yeah dude.
1810260	1817220	How fat is weaponized and the reclaiming of the word goes beyond size. Fat stigma is also tied to
1817220	1823940	anti-blackness in that being black is the abundance that white supremacy seeks to shrink. What?
1824340	1824840	How?
1828500	1836900	So, does this mean that being a fat white guy, I'm no longer a white supremacist? Am I black
1836900	1844420	now? Am I part of the abundance? My definition of fat is black as fuck, multi-dimensional
1844420	1849700	and futuristic. I don't know, I don't know how futuristic. It might not last another five years.
1850500	1857780	Fat means I exist. Fat means taking up space and demanding more. Fat means black. Fat means fuck
1857780	1863540	you. Fat means human. Fat means creating a world full of possibility without shame.
1864100	1869700	Fat means saying fuck you. It honestly sounds like the way that she writes it, fat means being
1869700	1874900	a colonizer. Like you know how you see those pictures of like the really fat guy in a suit
1874900	1879220	and it's like the capitalist and he just has like a ton of money and he's huge and like the
1879220	1884980	working class is like a skeleton like just barely scraping by on like one coin. So when this person
1884980	1892260	says fat means taking up space and demanding more, they're literally just like I want to be
1892260	1899060	the oppressor class. How to have sex with a fat girl. Touch, and I cannot stress this enough,
1899060	1901780	the fupa, this this picture.
1904420	1912580	Hold on, what's a fupa? I don't know if I want to know. The fat upper pubic area.
1918180	1925220	What? Oh my god, it's it's it's the gun. That's what it is. It's like that second stomach that
1925220	1932420	kind of comes out in front of the pubic region. The first the first few times I fucked as a fat
1932420	1939860	girl I exclusively wore my boyfriend's superman hoodie to hide my body. I was 16, a size 14 and
1939860	1947380	it was 2009. Long before body positivity hit the mainstream or my tumblr feed. Now as a 26 year
1947380	1953700	old woman wearing a size 20, sex has changed year after year as my body has gotten bigger and the
1953700	1960340	dating pool has gotten smaller. With plus size partners, we can press our bellies together,
1960900	1967620	grab each other's bodies and enjoy the thickness of our flesh in privacy. Touch the fupa.
1968660	1975300	It's a universal truth known by fat girls that the fupa is the most intimidating part of our body.
1975940	1982260	I know this because my fupa has been touched so little that I'm surprised she hasn't shriveled up
1982820	1991220	and fallen off. The hottest the hottest hookups are the ones that grab my belly like it's a third
1991220	1997620	tit. Kiss the flesh on the way down to the kitty and aren't pretending my body is less than it is.
2004900	2010100	There's a lot of things I regret. I think at this point you kind of know where where all this is
2010100	2016180	going. Diet culture and weight loss programs are a scam. Plus sized elf makes a joke of women's
2016180	2023540	bodies. Two fat professors are afraid of COVID-19 causing fat phobia. Speaking about health is
2023540	2030100	traumatizing for some who are impacted negatively by diet culture. Dear men, stop working out.
2030100	2034740	Physical fitness creates a cycle of toxic masculinity that must be eradicated.
2034740	2041460	On thinner bodies the strawberry TikTok dress skews a tiny bit fascist. I don't even need to
2041460	2046100	like read the content of these articles. I'm pretty sure at this point you can just imagine
2046100	2053220	what they say and you'll be right. The only way to be a proper BIPOC ally, to be anti-capitalist,
2053220	2058980	anti-fascist is to simply be more abundantly obese. Everything in this video is factually
2058980	2062420	correct by the way and if you disagree you simply haven't done enough research on the history of
2062420	2069540	fatness. Stay mad. I don't know how much work I can take but fine. The obesity epidemic isn't
2069540	2073380	real and it shouldn't be an anti-capitalist talking point. When someone unironically
2073380	2077380	references the obesity epidemic or even uses the word obesity it tells me they really don't know
2077380	2080980	what they're talking about when it comes to fatness. This use of the word obesity stems
2080980	2085540	directly from the BMI which was created by a eugenicist with no medical training who based
2085540	2091140	the scale only on white bodies and cow math. Fatness is not an epidemic. Fat people existed
2091140	2096260	before capitalism and before colonization. Fatphobia is a direct result of anti-blackness
2096260	2100260	and it has deadly consequences for many groups of indigenous folks and other people of color
2100260	2105460	as well as fat folks. When you make the obesity epidemic a real symptom of capitalism you are not
2105460	2110020	only ostracizing fat people from anti-capitalist thinking but also actively ignoring that the
2110020	2115220	health outcomes related to obesity are more accurately attributed to food deserts and
2115220	2120260	fatphobic discrimination in healthcare. The obesity epidemic was created by western medicine
2120260	2124900	to avoid addressing the actual causes of health inequity which is what we as anti-capitalists
2124900	2133380	should be doing. I would have to like spend the entire day talking about just how many things
2133380	2141220	are wrong in this video. Not only factually but like viscerally. But let's focus on the
2141220	2145220	food deserts thing because that's an important point and that leads us to the next topic of
2145220	2150020	discussion and considering that we are currently talking about the wider political tent that
2150020	2155780	constantly says trust the science believe the scientists there should be no objection to
2155780	2161300	talking about science right? Because as it turns out that is not what happens with food desertification.
2161300	2167700	Now what a food desert is is an area in like a large city where there's no grocery store so
2167700	2172260	there's no place to actually buy fresh food you can only go to restaurants and fast food places
2172260	2177300	and in places like that. But as reported on from the wall street journal what happens when new
2177300	2182500	supermarkets open in food deserts? Not what you think. For years public health advocates have
2182500	2186820	argued that food deserts neighborhoods without grocery stores or other fresh food vendors
2186820	2192020	contribute to a disproportionate burden of obesity and chronic disease among low-income individuals.
2192580	2197940	Ready access to fresh healthy food intuitively seems important for supporting a healthy diet
2198580	2203540	but recent evidence contests the idea that watering america's food deserts will solve the obesity
2203540	2209780	crisis. Compared with high-income individuals poor americans tend to have diets higher in sugar
2210340	2217700	fat and processed foods and lower in fiber fruits and vegetables. This nutritional inequality is a
2217700	2222980	contributor to the large income-based health disparities in the us and is thought to be due
2222980	2228420	in part to more limited access to healthy food. But does introducing a supermarket into a food
2228420	2232900	desert change the grocery habits of nearby residents? Not so much according to a recent
2232900	2239140	study. Researchers found that less than one-tenth of the nutritional inequality between high and
2239140	2246100	low-income households can be explained by the availability of healthy foods. The other 90% was
2246100	2254260	due to differences in demand. So even when you give people who are overweight the option to buy
2254260	2259620	healthy food they still don't do it. It's more than simply living in the ghetto and not having
2259620	2265060	access. It is a deeper problem than that. This is fucking ridiculous. People aren't obese because
2265060	2271380	there's junk food advertisements on before nine o'clock. People are obese because a pack of 20%
2271380	2278740	fat mincemeat is $3.95 and a pack of 5% fat is $5.79. People are obese because a pack of biscuits
2278740	2285540	is 20 pence and a pack of apples is two pounds. The actual problem seems to be a lack of knowledge
2285540	2293140	about how diets work. Dietary fat does not equate into body fat. In fact you're much more likely to
2293140	2297860	gain body fat from eating carbohydrates than you are from eating dietary fat and even then
2297860	2304260	it's based more on how many calories you burn. How much exercise you're doing is calories in
2304260	2310020	calories out. That's how it works. Your body does not violate the laws of thermodynamics.
2310020	2316740	You are actually better off buying that pack of 20% fat meat over the 5% fat as long as you're
2316740	2323140	also not eating an entire loaf of bread a day. The problem is sugar, it's carbs, it's gluten. That shit
2323140	2329140	is just empty calories with no nutritional value that just makes you hungrier. And people just don't
2329140	2335060	want to hear this even though it's the truth. Outrage as Whole Foods CEO says ignorance and
2335060	2341540	poor choices cause obesity. It's the truth dude. Overweight and healthy is a big fat lie.
2341540	2345940	Our findings refute the notion that a physically active lifestyle can completely negate the
2345940	2351780	deleterious effects of being overweight and obesity. You cannot be fat and healthy at the
2351780	2358340	same time. Even a fat person who you know lifts weights and runs and does all those things but is
2358340	2363620	still fat they would be much healthier without all the body fat. In fact check this out check this out
2363620	2368980	skinny jeans are the secret to staying slim. Oh shit is it all actually just genetics?
2368980	2374100	Researchers found that people who were obese were more likely to have a set of genes linked to being
2374100	2380180	overweight. Meanwhile people who were skinny not only had fewer genes linked to obesity
2380180	2387700	but also changes in gene regions newly associated with healthy thinness. So of course as with
2387700	2393220	everything in the human condition there is a genetic biological component. But I guarantee you
2393460	2397700	take the obese person with obese genes and throw them under the wild and just have them
2397700	2403860	starve they'll get thin. In fact a professor of nutrition and dietetics professor Tom Sanders
2403860	2409060	said this is an important study confirming that precocious severe obesity is often genetically
2409060	2414740	determined. But he also added most obesity is acquired in adult life and is linked to the
2414740	2419460	environment we live in. A sedentary lifestyle and abundant access to calorie dense foods.
2419460	2425460	Whatever your shape or genetic makeup the age-old advice of a healthy level of exercise and good
2425460	2432100	diet still stands. This is an article that fat activists constantly cite and they've only ever
2432100	2436500	read the headline and this is why you get shit like this. Does obesity really not cause any
2436500	2442980	health problems? I never knew. What I say what we always say is that being fat is not proven to
2442980	2449220	cause any illness only correlated with and that correlation is not causation is a basic principle
2449220	2454500	of science. However many of the illnesses that are correlated with fatness are proven to cause
2454500	2459220	weight gain or medications to treat them are. We also point out that there is no such thing as an
2459220	2464500	illness that only fat people get. This is the problem with scientism and I'm going to have to do
2465220	2471380	a video on science versus scientism at some point but basically if you have already ideologically
2471380	2476660	predetermined your end point then you simply pick and choose all of the science that leads you there
2476660	2481860	and ignore all the science that disagrees with you. Case in point fat sex therapist
2481860	2488260	compares fitness trainers to nazis children dieting to sexual assault. I truly believe
2488260	2493460	that a child cannot consent to being on a diet the same way a child cannot consent to having sex
2493460	2500020	says Sonali Rashatwar who attends Saint Olaf College. Rashatwar also believes that science
2500020	2505460	is white supremacist. We should be critical of the use of science and the production of knowledge
2505460	2510740	to continue promoting this idea that certain bodies are fit able and desirable. Is it my
2510740	2516660	fatness that causes my high blood pressure? Yes. Or is it my experience of weight stigma? It's
2516660	2521380	definitely your fatness. She then connected the science suggesting that obesity is unhealthy to
2521380	2529460	nazism saying that fat phobic science is often actually eugenic science. Eugenic science is nazi
2529460	2540180	science. You know you can say the most unscientific shit but simply use a few of the
2540180	2546900	words that some scientists have used in the past and then squint your eyes to make it real fuzzy
2546900	2552340	and then it kind of seems scientific. Even when it comes to modern problems like the coronavirus
2552340	2557220	COVID-19 death rates are 10 times higher in countries where most adults are overweight.
2557860	2562420	There is a link between whether or not you're going to die of coronavirus and if you are fat.
2562980	2569620	I am fat. To get the vaccine I had to say I'm obese. This word has done incredible damage to
2569620	2575060	my body. No, the damage was probably done by the fourth Big Mac you had that day. I understand that
2575060	2580580	doctors are including obese. Did you censor obesity? Oh my god. I understand that doctors
2580580	2586660	are including obesity as an underlying medical condition that leads to death in COVID patients.
2586660	2590740	Do these doctors have any idea what kind of impact this has on families to be told that
2590740	2594740	their loved one's body shape is partly to blame for their death? The impact doesn't matter. It
2594740	2600020	matters the truth. If you die because you're too fat it doesn't matter like the impact it has on
2600020	2604580	your on your family. What matters is that you were too fat and you died because you were too fat.
2604580	2609860	Furthermore when it comes to obesity and COVID deaths we have no evidence of causation and only
2609860	2614900	a weak association that continues to be disproven as times goes by. No it doesn't. What are these
2614900	2620340	junior doctors thinking? Give me one good reason for recording fatness as a cause of death. Well
2621700	2629460	causes of death as we've seen recently with George Floyd and other have been very politicized as of
2629460	2634740	late and I for one am happy to see someone actually telling the truth on these forms.
2634740	2640020	What I've managed to pull from all of this though is that these people are screeching about fat
2640020	2646180	acceptance from all possible angles. Cultural, scientific, representation, ideological,
2646180	2649860	they're using politics, they're using critical theory, they're using socialist theory,
2649860	2656740	they're using post-colonial theory, they're using everything that they can to basically turn fat and
2656740	2662900	thin into another variation of white and non-white or something like that to create more classes and
2662900	2669540	have them clash you know Marxist style. But the honest truth is when it comes to other alternative
2669540	2675300	body types among the broader left there seems to be like a serious hit and miss right? White
2675300	2681780	people calling fully grown Asian women cute is racist. No I will not explain. It's infantilizing
2681780	2688660	as hell. Yeah I'm tired. I'd rather just be called ugly at this point. All right you're ugly.
2688660	2694340	Aquaman looks hot because men want to be him. Carol Marcus looks hot because men want to fuck
2694340	2698260	her. I don't even know who this guy is I keep seeing him on twitter and he seems to be like
2698260	2704580	a grade-a moron. But dude dude do you see are you seriously saying that women don't want to
2704580	2709780	fuck Jason Momoa? Lizzo, who the fuck is Lizzo? You know who cares? Lizzo talks about double
2709780	2714420	standards for critiquing men's bodies versus women's. We don't talk about your dick sizes do we?
2717700	2723860	13 male celebs with seriously big bulges. Cosmopolitan confirmed. Men who objectify
2723860	2729620	women are effing horrible. Also cosmopolitan. 36 summer olympic bulges that deserve gold.
2729620	2736260	How many times how many fucking times has there been like height shaming for men? I've done like
2736260	2742020	a whole height shame video in the past and like you know dick size shaming. Even when the guy in
2742020	2747460	question is tall and probably has like an average or even slightly above average dick size they'll
2747460	2751300	simply throw that out there if they don't like what he's saying. It's like oh you like the wrong
2751300	2755380	politics, you like the wrong sports teams, like the wrong video games, have the wrong opinions
2755380	2759700	online, make fun of the wrong thing, make the wrong joke, whatever. Oh you're probably short
2759700	2765620	and you have a tiny dick. Dude this shit happens everywhere and sometimes it's funny right like
2765620	2770580	you see a guy who has like 10 guns or he has like a giant truck and it's like that guy's compensating
2770580	2777540	hahaha like it's a joke all right and it's fine it's allowed but don't act like it doesn't happen.
2777540	2782660	Do you recall Beachbody Ready? This was I think 2016 or something it was a while ago
2782660	2788900	where London mayor Sadiq Khan banned this shit because it was apparently objectifying because
2788900	2793140	it was a woman who was in shape and very clearly worked to get in shape. It was it was like a
2793140	2797460	protein powder weight loss advertisement and everyone was like how dare you! On February
2797460	2804420	10th of 2020 Sadiq Khan was proud to announce on his official twitter the Nubian skin advertisement
2804420	2810740	which was just like an underwear advertisement and you'll notice it's four plus size women and
2810740	2816900	two dudes with rippling abs. Where's the representation? Where's the outcry? The whole
2816900	2825060	body positive argument falls apart as soon as you see how the left treats people with alternative
2825060	2830980	body types when one they're not fat they're extremely skinny or they're in some other way
2830980	2838820	different or two they're not leftists. It is extremely telling to me that when radical
2838820	2844500	feminist male female whatever doesn't matter when they write about what looks are outdated
2844500	2850660	or sexist or toxic it's always traditionally attractive people men and women alike and when
2850660	2856900	they write about what's actually sexy amazing stunning brave and what should be pined after
2856900	2863780	it just so happens to be how they look and it's generally kind of hideous and then when they bump
2863780	2870020	into somebody who is in some way hideous in the exact way that they've written about but does not
2870020	2875620	share their politics maybe they have some problem that is not socially acceptable to admit like you
2875620	2880180	can go online and say you have all sorts of different mental problems but if you know if
2880180	2883700	you're actually an incel like if you're someone who can't get a girlfriend and you're like depressed
2883700	2886820	about it and you feel like the world's out to get you you're kind of on the lowest rung or the totem
2886820	2892020	pole when it comes to men yeah body positivity doesn't apply to them body positivity doesn't
2892020	2898340	apply to say short men or thin women or women who have suffered from anorexia or bulimia the rules
2898340	2905700	that have been set out in this video are only valid if it helps that intersectional lefty cause
2905700	2910980	which is why at least to me it seems like a big old bunch of bullshit and that being said whenever
2910980	2917540	i see somebody demand something regarding body positivity i just laugh at them because i know
2917540	2921860	that they're living hypocrites i'm still going to tell the same jokes i'm still going to laugh at
2921860	2927140	the same things you're still going to be ridiculous when you complain that the new resident evil game
2927140	2931620	has a fat guy and they're like how dare you link fatness with gluttony and it's like you do that
2931620	2936580	every time you complain about capitalism and post a caricature so you know what i'm willing to bet
2936580	2940900	that if you're actually out here talking about body positivity you're just a fucking hypocrite
2940900	2945700	and there is no reason anyone should believe you and if you want to actually be body positive
2945700	2950500	then encourage people to self-improve help the fat person at your local gym
2950500	2955700	tell them they can make it because you know what we're all gonna make it bros for real
