WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.640
If there's one trend that I'm really enjoying right now, it's the posting their L's accounts.

00:10.640 --> 00:16.500
E-boys posting their L's. E-girls posting their L's. Think tanks posting their L's.

00:16.500 --> 00:21.660
Coomers posting their L's. But the one that I like most of all, and probably the only one that

00:21.660 --> 00:29.020
I can intersectionally talk about myself, is fat people posting their L's. And yes, being a person

00:29.080 --> 00:35.720
of size myself, I am in fact allowed to do this video topic. Nobody else can. None of you thin

00:35.720 --> 00:42.100
people, otherwise known as thiggers, can in fact do this. Only we fats can, understand? I just want

00:42.100 --> 00:48.600
to point out before we begin, this is definitely a video where we laugh and chuckle. It's less

00:48.600 --> 00:53.080
about the point, even though there will be a point at the end. It's less about the point and more

00:53.080 --> 00:58.760
about the fun. So let's go. I would rather be out here celebrating and finding peace with our

00:58.760 --> 01:05.180
magical bodies rather than projecting our own insecurities. Edit. Actually, it would be nice

01:05.180 --> 01:09.920
if people could just mind their own fucking business. I love the use of the black emojis.

01:09.920 --> 01:14.960
I use them all the time too. Honestly, take the time to try and decolonize your mind instead of

01:14.960 --> 01:19.860
sucking the joy out of fat pussy love. Man, we're starting off strong. I don't even know, like, am I

01:19.860 --> 01:26.100
allowed to show you this? Because like, that looks like it might be the vagina, but I can't tell.

01:26.100 --> 01:29.760
Actually, I can't, you know what, looking at it now, I can't even tell what side of the person

01:29.760 --> 01:35.880
we're looking at. It's diabetes and coronary artery disease. Can you rephrase that in body

01:35.880 --> 01:42.840
positive terms? Okay, I'll give it a shot. You're so brave and fabulous that your pancreas and heart

01:42.840 --> 01:49.640
can't keep up. Oh yeah, I remember this. I remember this from back during, I think, the release of

01:49.640 --> 01:55.920
Smash 4 when Sakurai added the Wii Fit Trainer character. Looks like I won't be buying Super

01:55.920 --> 02:00.860
Smash Bros since Nintendo apparently supports fat shaming, as seen by the inclusion of the

02:00.860 --> 02:06.660
whitewashed embodiment of thin privilege herself, the Wii Fit Trainer. Okay, so for those of you who

02:06.660 --> 02:13.340
don't know, basically on the Wii they had a balance board. You could stand on it, do exercises with

02:13.340 --> 02:20.220
it. It was a pretty good casual game. There was a lot of like yoga and stuff, but the actual mascot

02:20.220 --> 02:24.940
of the game was this mannequin-looking woman who would move around and do the yoga with you and

02:24.960 --> 02:29.680
show you how to do it. I mean, she's very clearly not like a white person. She's a white mannequin.

02:29.680 --> 02:36.640
Like she's just like pure eggshell white, you know? But even back then, back when Wii Fit came

02:36.640 --> 02:42.520
out, which was what, 2008 or something, people were complaining that Nintendo was being fat

02:42.520 --> 02:48.160
phobic for releasing the game. After the horrifying fiasco that was Microsoft's conference yesterday

02:48.160 --> 02:53.560
where a woman was literally raped for losing a round of killer instinct. Oh yeah, I remember

02:53.620 --> 03:01.620
this. This was like, what, 2012, 2013's E3? Check out this clip, guys. This is gonna get interesting.

03:01.620 --> 03:04.980
For those of you who don't know, Torin's the producer for Killer Instinct, and he's brought

03:04.980 --> 03:08.700
out the new tournament edition, Mad Catz Fight Stick, which will be available at the launch

03:08.700 --> 03:17.140
of Killer Instinct. Good luck, Ashton. Come on, Ashton, bring it. Whoever thought it was a good

03:17.140 --> 03:22.060
idea that I play against a producer is gonna get it. Come on, you gotta practice before you get on

03:22.060 --> 03:28.600
stage in front of millions of people. I can't even block correctly, and you're too fast. There

03:28.600 --> 03:35.760
we go. Just let it happen, it'll be over soon. You have a fight stick! Man, if this happened

03:35.760 --> 03:42.280
like E3 2020 or 2021, there would be such an outrage mob, but back then it was just laughed

03:42.280 --> 03:48.480
about on 4chan. Obese woman was arrested for starving her seven kids. There was only enough

03:48.500 --> 03:52.620
food for me. Look at the fucking picture, look at this woman and look at those kids. They're

03:52.620 --> 03:57.240
like skeletons, dude, they're like Ethiopian level. A disturbing report is coming out of

03:57.240 --> 04:03.620
Louisiana this morning that tells the story of 27-year-old Lakisha Connors, who reportedly

04:03.620 --> 04:08.220
starved her children nearly to death. Mother of seven was arrested on Thursday evening when

04:08.220 --> 04:13.780
neighbors called police and said they saw extremely unhealthy looking children digging

04:13.780 --> 04:18.640
through the trash cans on the side yard. When police arrived and knocked on the door,

04:18.640 --> 04:23.920
they were greeted by three-year-old Ammonette Connors and five-year-old Dante Connors who

04:23.920 --> 04:27.820
let them into the home. Authorities say they found the mother passed out on the couch. What

04:27.820 --> 04:34.360
the actual fuck? Okay, we can tell by the size of this woman, there's clearly more than enough

04:34.360 --> 04:39.720
food going around. The kids could literally eat their mother and be fine for a few years here,

04:40.020 --> 04:47.400
sometimes we eat, sometimes we don't. Yeah, press X to doubt. Oh God,

04:47.400 --> 04:55.220
do you even want to read this story? Let's talk accessibility. I'm an infini-fat. You're

04:55.220 --> 05:01.560
infinitely fat, meaning I wear plus 30 clothing in the UK and many shops don't carry that. I use

05:01.560 --> 05:05.740
the disabled toilet because that's what I need to do, but they're still not very fat friendly.

05:05.740 --> 05:10.240
Things are put as close together as possible, giving me no space to wipe myself. Oh God,

05:10.240 --> 05:16.880
I'm luckily flexible and do what I call a wipe yoga. I have to take off my bottoms and often

05:16.880 --> 05:25.080
one shoe to be able to place my leg on the wall or something else to balance on to wipe. Imagine

05:25.080 --> 05:30.480
letting yourself get so fat that you have to do yoga to reach your asshole. This can be a

05:30.480 --> 05:34.760
workout. I'm panting, shaking, and starting to feel rubbish afterwards. Well, you do need a

05:34.780 --> 05:39.860
workout, but I do need the toilet sometimes like all humans do. In the UK, they like to lock the

05:39.860 --> 05:43.980
damn doors for a disabled user. You have to hunt down a person with the key. It's exhausting,

05:43.980 --> 05:48.380
and this time I'm at the National Museum in Cardiff and the bloody toilets are down a flight

05:48.380 --> 05:53.420
of stairs. The lift doesn't work. I can and do walk up and down stairs, but people who can't,

05:53.420 --> 06:00.060
it's bullshit. And then they, what was it? They had some Arby's. You might be thinking Arby's,

06:00.120 --> 06:06.160
but you probably shouldn't be eating it if you're having to do wipe yoga. How do you poo?

06:06.160 --> 06:20.700
I weigh nearly 600 pounds now, so I have to sit down, but not on the toilet because it would

06:20.700 --> 06:26.360
break. I use a beanbag chair as my toilet because when I sit on it, it creates a kind of space in

06:26.420 --> 06:32.180
the middle with surrounding walls. So when I shit, the fecal matter spreads around me,

06:32.180 --> 06:39.980
but doesn't overflow. Then I scoop the shit into the toilet, usually flushing four or five times

06:39.980 --> 06:45.700
to get it all down. It fucking sucks because I use the same beanbag for general sitting,

06:45.700 --> 06:58.040
and it's starting to smell. Don't get fat, bros. I've tried shitting into a mini fridge

06:58.040 --> 07:04.540
that has been turned on so the cold would cause the shit to condense its moisture and make it

07:04.540 --> 07:12.800
easier to flush, but it wasn't comfortable. I can just imagine this fat whoa jack here holding a

07:12.820 --> 07:20.140
full-ass mini fridge directly up to his asshole and filling it with shit. They sent my OnlyFans

07:20.140 --> 07:30.200
content to my fans. Is this a real video? There's no way this woman... Oh my God, it's real.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.340
I have feelings when it comes to my OnlyFans, and you guys are probably like,

07:46.340 --> 07:55.220
just quit fucking talking about it. I have to because I'll just explain. So for me,

07:55.220 --> 08:02.840
I'm trying to break the stigma that that girls are too big or too impulsive or too overweight

08:02.840 --> 08:12.780
to have sex because just like our appetites, sex can be a bit ravenous too. Is that why you

08:12.780 --> 08:18.020
have the tusks? Good God the comments on this video were unreal. Hey Wendy's, my overweight

08:18.020 --> 08:22.520
friend and her adult daughters went to your Toledo store. Richard at the counter, who had

08:22.520 --> 08:27.620
never met them before, had said the usual. My friend says, what are you talking about? Richard

08:27.620 --> 08:35.120
says two of everything. She doesn't even want her lunch now she's crying. I always knew Wendy's

08:35.120 --> 08:43.200
was based, but damn. Mum who spent 93 pounds to travel 82 miles for Tinder date called fat and

08:43.200 --> 08:51.800
then dumped. That's rough. Tinder's a rough place to be anyway. The pair had met a few times before

08:51.800 --> 08:56.880
and she was chatting to him on the phone when she arrived. She explained, that's when he said,

08:57.140 --> 09:02.740
fuck me, you've put on some weight, haven't you? I was like, no, you can't say that. Hold on,

09:02.740 --> 09:07.660
hold on, hold on, hold on. So if you haven't put on the weight, you just say, no, I haven't. Like

09:07.660 --> 09:12.260
if there's some kind of like miscommunication or he misremembers or something, but she doesn't even

09:12.260 --> 09:21.660
deny it, she just says it, you can't say that to me. And she started a GoFundMe to get her

09:21.660 --> 09:27.920
90 pounds back because her date called her fat. I just want to make my 90 pounds travel money back

09:27.920 --> 09:32.800
so I can buy wine and sticks of lard. There are like a billion funny stories like that,

09:32.800 --> 09:38.920
but as you keep digging just beyond the surface level humor, being to realize there's actually

09:38.920 --> 09:45.800
like a fat positivity movement or something. Dear my skinny friends, what are you actively

09:45.940 --> 09:50.940
doing to unlearn the gaze that renders fat folks unattractive? Now you can see this is,

09:50.940 --> 09:57.980
this is already steeped in that intersectionalist language where it's, it's unlearn rather than

09:57.980 --> 10:02.460
something being innate like attraction or it's, it's a gaze like the male gaze. You know,

10:02.460 --> 10:07.040
this is the anti-fat gaze that apparently we all have when we're not attracted to a fat person.

10:07.040 --> 10:12.300
It's strange because we accept sexual orientation as being an immutable characteristic, right? This

10:12.320 --> 10:17.960
idea that you can't really change who you're attracted to. And yet when it comes to like in

10:17.960 --> 10:21.560
the super straight video, being attracted to trans people or being attracted to fat people,

10:21.560 --> 10:27.200
like, like in this video, uh, now it's something that needs to be unlearned. Imagine telling a gay

10:27.200 --> 10:32.340
person to unlearn their attraction. See how far that would get you. Dear friends with bodies of

10:32.340 --> 10:38.720
normalized sizes. See, even the way, like I could just pick apart every single sentence here because

10:38.820 --> 10:42.100
I kind of, I've been reading a lot of books on intersectionality and critical theory,

10:42.100 --> 10:47.620
and they, they phrase it this way so that rather than being fat is something that they've done to

10:47.620 --> 10:52.520
themselves, whether that through diet, lack of exercise, even if they have some kind of medical

10:52.520 --> 10:57.320
condition that makes them more prone to put on weight, they haven't managed it well, rather than

10:57.320 --> 11:02.540
it being any of those things. It is something that society has pushed on them. It's external.

11:02.540 --> 11:07.760
So rather than being thin or making themselves thin or keeping themselves thin, your average

11:07.780 --> 11:16.740
person has bodies of normalized sizes. See this now passive that sounds how it's simply society's

11:16.740 --> 11:22.100
fault that those sizes are normalized. And that's the only issue we're dealing with here. Let's stop

11:22.100 --> 11:28.300
pretending that our non desires are simply preferences and not culturally informed. So,

11:28.300 --> 11:34.220
okay. Literally the argument that Christians gave against gay marriage got it. Or as if they were

11:34.220 --> 11:40.940
just a given fact that one can't influence. If your idea of body positivity stops at simply not

11:40.940 --> 11:48.200
actively shaming fat folks, I call it doesn't go far enough. Okay. So if you're not having sex with

11:48.200 --> 11:55.220
the fat person, then you are oppressive. Suck the fat roll bigot. This whole thing honestly

11:55.220 --> 12:00.840
reads like it was written by an incel. As queers, we've left the heteronormative desirability matrix,

12:00.960 --> 12:05.280
but what about the other norms that determine who's hot and who's not, including those within

12:05.280 --> 12:10.440
our own communities, hand on heart? How many of the people you had a crush on were fat? How many

12:10.440 --> 12:15.920
are your partners? Are the people you swipe right on Tinder, message on OkCupid or flirt with at the

12:15.920 --> 12:22.800
club, mainly thin people, masculine presenting, able bodied and white? We are literally at the

12:22.800 --> 12:28.840
policing other people's consent stage of radical intersectionality because a lot of these broadly

12:29.040 --> 12:34.320
radical left ideas require violating people's consent. If you're a socialist, you have to

12:34.320 --> 12:39.120
violate the consent of people who own property, or even if they don't own property, they don't

12:39.120 --> 12:44.280
want their labor collectivized. If you're an intersectionalist, you have to violate people's

12:44.280 --> 12:49.000
consent in this way. It no longer matters if you choose X. If that's an oppressive choice,

12:49.000 --> 12:55.520
your consent doesn't matter anymore. Consent is basically a modern expression of the older liberal

12:55.560 --> 13:00.640
conception of natural rights, and the left's historic materialists have already given up

13:00.640 --> 13:04.800
the idea of natural rights. And yeah, we've already reached the point too where they have

13:04.800 --> 13:13.040
to basically go actively hunting for microaggressions. Fellow fats, fellow fats,

13:13.040 --> 13:19.440
what's something that's not explicitly anti-fat, but you experience as anti-fatness? For example,

13:19.440 --> 13:23.160
when thin friends only seem to want to process their body insecurities with you,

13:23.680 --> 13:28.840
their fattest friend, talking to you at length about food addiction, etc. I've noticed that

13:28.840 --> 13:33.960
people feel really entitled to my time and help. I get approached a lot with people asking for

13:33.960 --> 13:38.720
directions, where something is, if I know which train someone needs to get on, etc. etc. So yeah,

13:38.720 --> 13:43.760
yeah, we're at the point where asking someone directions is fatphobia. Of course, these things

13:43.760 --> 13:48.960
intersect in strange ways, don't they? Men who don't wear jackets in cold weather do so with

13:48.960 --> 13:54.280
the express intent of intimidating women and to make women feel like lesser beings. If you see

13:54.280 --> 13:59.200
a man who is not wearing a jacket when you're cold, then call him out on his toxic masculinity

13:59.200 --> 14:05.240
and his ego violence. Yeah, well, you know what sentient Jessica? What if that man is just really,

14:05.240 --> 14:09.280
really fat and therefore the cold doesn't really affect them at all? Like they have all that extra

14:09.280 --> 14:14.320
blubber to insulate things. Are you going to be fatphobic and call them out then? Why are men

14:14.560 --> 14:20.840
larger than women? It makes no evolutionary sense for women to be smaller, because everything from

14:20.840 --> 14:26.720
birthing children to surviving predators would be easier if we were the same size as men. So why are

14:26.720 --> 14:33.480
we smaller? Because men have starved women of food for untold generations to ensure their own

14:33.480 --> 14:39.440
survival. A smaller body means women can survive with less food and have more to share with their

14:39.440 --> 14:44.880
children because with men around, both mother and child are going to get less of everything. So

14:44.880 --> 14:50.120
smaller women were more likely to survive a time of famine and therefore we have evolved to become

14:50.120 --> 14:57.040
smaller so we can survive men's greed. This sounds very anti-fat to me. In fact, it sounds like you're

14:57.040 --> 15:04.920
saying a fat person's fatness is based not on an immutable characteristic, but on diet. How dare

15:04.920 --> 15:11.520
you? This asexual TikToker has a message for haters. Alright, let's check it out. My name is

15:11.520 --> 15:23.200
Steven McHale and I identify as asexual. Don't worry buddy, the feeling is mutual. That's the

15:23.200 --> 15:28.320
thing, a lot of asexuality is caused by being ridiculously overweight to the point that the

15:28.320 --> 15:36.280
sex drive plummets and I think there's definitely some kind of overlap between people rigidly

15:36.280 --> 15:41.480
demanding that asexuality be accepted and fair enough, if you're asexual, like whatever, right?

15:41.480 --> 15:48.560
But the fact that there is a overlap between that and being very unhealthy, I have a feeling that if

15:48.560 --> 15:54.680
most asexuals, not all, but if most asexuals got a handle on their health, they probably wouldn't be

15:54.680 --> 16:01.800
asexuals anymore. Keto is racist. Sargon, Sargon, I didn't know you were this kind of a person. I

16:01.800 --> 16:08.400
can't prove it, but just gives me white supremacy vibes. To be honest, any diet or anything that

16:08.400 --> 16:12.920
promotes weight loss is oppressive. I rest my case, your honor. This tweet was a joke when I

16:12.920 --> 16:18.080
was half asleep, but since y'all want to get into it, let's do it, okay? First, keto was originally

16:18.080 --> 16:22.840
created to treat patients who had epilepsy and somehow white women co-opted it into a weight

16:22.880 --> 16:30.120
loss diet, so it's ableist. Diet culture and fat phobia are rooted in racism and white supremacy.

16:30.120 --> 16:37.000
Any diet or restrictive eating that alters your body from its natural state is racist. The beauty

16:37.000 --> 16:43.960
model, hold the fuck on, wait, wait, wait, wait a second, alters your body from its natural state.

16:43.960 --> 16:50.080
Does this mean that every single trans person is racist? The beauty model most wanted to achieve

16:50.120 --> 16:56.440
is a colonized goal. We have to decolonize the way we should let our body be and grow. So,

16:56.440 --> 17:03.240
when trans people take hormones or surgically alter their body, it's racism? There is a coup

17:03.240 --> 17:09.320
going on in the New York Times Cooking Community Facebook group. Here's the scoop. A member posted

17:09.320 --> 17:13.560
about making sure to vote, and the moderators removed his post since the group is supposed

17:13.560 --> 17:19.240
to be a haven from politics focused only on food. Judging by your avatar, you too are focused only

17:19.440 --> 17:25.240
on food. The members, numbering over 62,000, weren't having it and made it clear that food

17:25.240 --> 17:31.600
is undoubtedly political. They began to fashion food to spell vote using captions only directly

17:31.600 --> 17:37.800
related to food. Bottom line, food is political. Food can be used to build community, change lives,

17:37.800 --> 17:45.200
feed the hungry, inspire creativity, and it could also be easily squandered. Use your voice and your

17:45.240 --> 17:51.960
food to inspire change. Do you think you could change your diet? Hot tip. Posting weight loss

17:51.960 --> 17:58.360
photos shows us which bodies you value, no matter how body positive your caption sounds. If you

17:58.360 --> 18:03.240
don't want us to believe thinner is better, then stop reinforcing that message under the guise of

18:03.240 --> 18:11.120
self-love. That's right, my friends. Weight loss progress is ableist, or fatphobic, or racist,

18:11.120 --> 18:15.040
or whatever the fuck. And that's actually been a really common thing for people to say the past

18:15.040 --> 18:19.760
few years. Remember when, um, what's that one singer's name? I forget her name, she was a fat

18:19.760 --> 18:24.400
singer and she lost all of her weight. And people were just like descending on her like, how dare

18:24.400 --> 18:29.640
you post the fact that you lost all your fat and now you look like a regular person. It's like,

18:29.640 --> 18:34.160
geez dude, like are you, are you so jealous that you haven't lost your own weight yet that you're

18:34.160 --> 18:40.160
gonna just shit on everyone who is trying to live healthier and self-improve. Buying plus-size

18:40.200 --> 18:45.560
clothing from thrift stores you can tailor the items down to your size zero body isn't a cute

18:45.560 --> 18:51.960
YouTube video idea. It's fatphobic and classist and taking resources away from poor fat people

18:51.960 --> 18:57.800
who have an infinitely harder time finding clothes than you do. Okay, so do not buy clothes that

18:57.800 --> 19:02.840
aren't your size. Got it. Can we also apply this to fat people who still think that they fit into

19:02.840 --> 19:07.640
like their high school clothing and are walking around in stuff that is like obviously too tight

19:07.680 --> 19:13.040
and nobody wants to see that. I just ran an entire mile in nine minutes and 26 seconds.

19:13.040 --> 19:19.440
I used to weigh 363 pounds and now I'm running a mile in under 10 minutes. Congratulations. You,

19:19.440 --> 19:24.200
you, you, you, you. Why did so many of my mutuals I thought were body positive like this? Bye.

19:24.200 --> 19:30.680
You're literally just jealous and bitter that this person has gotten into shape and is now

19:30.680 --> 19:36.680
like running. I thought you were body positive. Like really, you don't think that like an athlete's

19:36.720 --> 19:42.960
body is something also worthy of being positive towards? Just say no to transformation Tuesday.

19:42.960 --> 19:48.000
Whether you're trying to depict your weight loss or weight gain, these pics aren't helpful.

19:48.000 --> 19:54.560
Preliminary research, God, you're always with these appeals. Preliminary research has shown

19:54.560 --> 20:00.080
that exposure to transformation pictures of any kind of social media increases negative body image

20:00.080 --> 20:04.240
and self-objectification. When it comes down to it, these types of images promote physical

20:04.240 --> 20:09.360
comparisons. They promote fat phobia when depicting weight loss. When depicting weight gain,

20:09.360 --> 20:13.400
they promote competition and feelings of not being sick enough among the recovery community.

20:13.400 --> 20:20.280
Just say no to transformation pics. Literally hide me from my own ideals that I don't feel bad.

20:20.280 --> 20:26.840
If you post a weight loss before and after pics, I will instantly unfollow you. It's triggering an

20:26.840 --> 20:33.640
inherently fat phobic smooch. What you choose to do with your body is your business, but promoting

20:33.680 --> 20:38.160
and celebrating weight loss is triggering for many people and is deeply entrenched in fat phobia.

20:38.160 --> 20:42.320
What you're showing every fat person is that our bodies are something to hate,

20:42.320 --> 20:48.320
something to celebrate becoming smaller. Diet culture is buried in capitalism and racism. I

20:48.320 --> 20:53.880
am no longer gently asking people to educate themselves. Now is the time to examine every

20:53.880 --> 20:59.200
way you make passes in your life with these violent systems. This also extends to the way

20:59.200 --> 21:04.080
fitness culture has adopted body-positive language in ways that promote fat phobia

21:04.080 --> 21:08.760
insidiously. Do what makes you feel good in your body, but the ways we celebrate our

21:08.760 --> 21:15.760
bodies becoming smaller is still deeply entwined in fat phobia. Translation here is that the

21:15.760 --> 21:20.280
ideology is more important than the reality. It doesn't matter about your health. It doesn't even

21:20.280 --> 21:26.820
matter about how you feel. It doesn't matter about your goals. What matters is the ideology.

21:26.820 --> 21:31.140
If you do something that is by all other objective metrics good for you,

21:31.140 --> 21:40.980
if it's fat phobic, that's what matters. Junk food does not exist. I wish. Food is food. The

21:40.980 --> 21:45.820
use of this language is generally to police fat people, but fat people have existed before that

21:45.820 --> 21:52.180
language and will exist after it's long gone. Yeah dude, all of those starving kulaks, they

21:52.180 --> 21:58.660
were like 600 pounds and they all died, eh? Is that how it was? Food is food. You need fats and

21:58.660 --> 22:04.100
carbohydrates too. Well, not really carbohydrates, but you do need fats. Food is not healthy or

22:04.100 --> 22:11.020
unhealthy. It's food. Railing against junk food or unhealthy food is hella anti-black, classist,

22:11.020 --> 22:15.460
and anti-black. How is it anti-black? Food is motherfucking food. Food provides food

22:15.460 --> 22:20.020
treatments. Food is good. So many people have such horrific relationships with food because

22:20.020 --> 22:24.260
diet culture teaches us to. Imagine that everything you thought you knew about food

22:24.260 --> 22:30.060
was taught on a white supremacist, capitalist, anti-black foundation because it was. Man,

22:30.060 --> 22:38.780
like this is where the drive for ultimate equality leads us. Everything must be equal to every other

22:38.780 --> 22:45.740
thing all the time. There is no difference between say eating a really greasy, fully loaded pizza and

22:45.740 --> 22:52.420
a protein shake. It's all just food. Nutrients and macros and calories, none of that shit exists.

22:52.420 --> 23:00.660
If it's all the same, why don't you just eat dirt? Casual fucking reminder that the white race

23:00.660 --> 23:07.860
scientists invent, white race scientists. Race science, you guys. When they measure your waist,

23:07.860 --> 23:13.100
it's like measuring your skull. All right, all right. Casual fucking reminder that white race

23:13.140 --> 23:20.620
scientists invented fat phobia and the concept of obesity. If you are ever fat phobic or on some,

23:20.620 --> 23:25.700
oh well fat is unhealthy, ooh, ooh bullshit, I hope you fucking know that someone's white

23:25.700 --> 23:34.380
ancestor is smiling in their grave. You know, a show that was considered woke and radically left,

23:34.380 --> 23:42.020
say 10, 15, I think almost even 20 years ago was the Boondocks. And in one of those episodes

23:42.060 --> 23:48.900
of the Boondocks, grandpa opens a restaurant for soul food where they cook up, you know,

23:48.900 --> 23:54.900
culturally relevant black foods, but they're also very, very unhealthy. And it turns out that the

23:54.900 --> 24:00.060
reason that, you know, black people historically ate that way was because one, they were slaves,

24:00.060 --> 24:03.420
they had to eat whatever they could get it, get their hands on. And two, because they were very

24:03.420 --> 24:10.700
poor, even after slavery was abolished. And so this culture of cooking very unhealthy,

24:10.700 --> 24:17.260
but very cheap foods and making them taste very good came about. And grandpa keeps serving this

24:17.260 --> 24:22.100
food because he's black and it's part of his culture. And even though he's no longer poor,

24:22.100 --> 24:27.180
the way that he was when he was young, still feels a cultural impetus to serve this food.

24:27.180 --> 24:33.820
And of course people eat it and they fucking like fall asleep in the restaurant because it's just

24:33.820 --> 24:39.500
so, you know, insulin overpowering. I'm pretty sure some even has like a heart attack in the

24:39.500 --> 24:43.020
restaurant. I haven't seen the episode in years and years, so I don't know. But basically the

24:43.020 --> 24:50.740
point is, is that even then, even in this woke lefty show, they said our ancestors ate this

24:50.740 --> 24:57.420
stuff because they had to. And even though it is a cultural celebration, maybe we can also move past

24:57.420 --> 25:03.020
it. Since then, instead of moving past it, they've decided to simply make being fat part of black

25:03.020 --> 25:08.460
culture. All right. Plus sized women admit they aren't attracted to overweight men. Wait, wait,

25:08.460 --> 25:14.220
wait a second. Why are the women plus sized and the men overweight as a plus sized woman? There's

25:14.220 --> 25:19.260
this expectation that she'd only date overweight men. These women open up about dealing with the

25:19.260 --> 25:25.140
stigma of being plus sized and refusing to settle and date overweight men. Well, hold on. Do you

25:25.140 --> 25:29.980
think that like regular sized men should settle and date you? Like, why is it settling when you

25:29.980 --> 25:35.620
do it, but not when they, what the fuck is this? Sometimes I feel guilty because I'm not attracted

25:35.620 --> 25:40.860
to bigger guys, even though I'm plus size myself. I find it rare to find a big guy that takes care

25:40.860 --> 25:45.540
of his appearance and hygiene the way I do. I'm a plus size woman, but I'm not attracted to big

25:45.540 --> 25:50.460
guys. I get a lot of hate and criticism for that, but I can't help that I like average to muscular

25:50.460 --> 25:56.980
types. Well, it sounds like you need to decolonize your thinking on this and become more attracted to

25:56.980 --> 26:02.300
fat people. I'm plus size and I'm not attracted to really big guys. I've never been ruder me. It's

26:02.300 --> 26:06.620
just not my thing. Everyone has a body they like to look at and overweight man is not one of mine.

26:06.620 --> 26:11.860
I feel so hypocritical. I'm plus size and I'm not attracted to bigger guys. I only like average body

26:11.860 --> 26:16.460
types. Not a ton of muscles, just average. I hate when people think I have to date bigger guys

26:16.460 --> 26:20.900
because I'm plus sized. I can't help that I'm not attracted to them and I like muscular guys. Look

26:20.900 --> 26:27.460
at all this colonized thinking. I can't help it. Yes, you can. Thinness ain't an accomplishment.

26:27.700 --> 26:33.100
Weight loss ain't an accomplishment. I know y'all hate fat people and fatness so much. You believe

26:33.100 --> 26:36.980
the size of your body should be can praise and congratulate it over. So now we've moved past

26:36.980 --> 26:42.620
don't talk about your accomplishments into it's not even an accomplishment. This process is like

26:42.620 --> 26:49.820
Yuri Bezmenov applied to fat people. Things have gotten so ridiculous that I think this is in the

26:49.820 --> 26:57.320
UK. I'm pretty sure it's in the UK. There was a proposed law to make it illegal to alter your

26:57.320 --> 27:04.780
online photos that you look thinner than you actually are. Tory MP Dr. Luke Evans said doctored

27:04.780 --> 27:11.700
Instagram images are creating a warped view of beauty and fueling a mental health crisis. We

27:11.700 --> 27:16.340
will monitor your social media and if it does not show you exactly as fat as we think you are,

27:16.500 --> 27:22.860
we will fine you. And of course to go along with all these takes an entire industry of like,

27:22.860 --> 27:29.620
I don't know how we'd even even call it like alternative science has appeared to fuel and

27:29.620 --> 27:36.100
feed these people no pun intended. All of the reassurance that could ever possibly want. Fat

27:36.100 --> 27:42.260
is not the problem. Fat stigma is. Health experts, notice how the word experts is in quotes this time

27:42.260 --> 27:46.820
around when it goes against the narrative, are sending incorrect and destructive messages about

27:46.820 --> 27:53.460
the relationship between weight and wellness. Are you sure? Obesity is the biggest threat to the

27:53.460 --> 27:58.500
health of our nation. This all too common suggestion does far greater damage to public

27:58.500 --> 28:04.740
health than fat tissue itself. When the focus is on weight and body size it's not obesity that

28:04.740 --> 28:09.340
damages people, it's fear mongering about their bodies that puts them at risk for diabetes,

28:09.340 --> 28:15.020
heart disease, discrimination, bullying, eating disorders, sedentariness, lifelong discomfort in

28:15.020 --> 28:20.620
their bodies and even early death. Really, so it's fear mongering about their bodies that cause all

28:20.620 --> 28:25.980
this shit. Not being so fat that you look like a naked chicken. The data refutes long standing,

28:25.980 --> 28:31.900
widespread and incorrect notions about health and weight. Like the fact that fat is a primary

28:31.900 --> 28:37.700
driver in metabolic disease or that weight loss prolongs life or improves health. None of this

28:37.700 --> 28:44.580
is true. Meanwhile, next fucking paragraph, it is true that many diseases are more commonly found

28:44.580 --> 28:54.340
in heavier people. However, that doesn't mean that weight itself causes disease. Blaming fatness for

28:54.340 --> 28:58.820
heart disease is similar to blaming yellow teeth for lung cancer rather than considering that

28:58.820 --> 29:05.620
smoking might play a role in both. Okay, so we will get into the science of this a little bit

29:05.620 --> 29:11.780
later but I just want you to keep this article in mind when we do, okay? Oh god, look at the

29:11.780 --> 29:18.580
header for this article. Fat is not a bad word. For me, fat is a way of saying fuck you. No matter how

29:18.580 --> 29:25.380
people use it, fat is not a bad word. Fat is not an indication of value, health, beauty or performance.

29:25.940 --> 29:32.100
Fat is a descriptor in the same way that black and queer are descriptors and fat is somewhat similar

29:32.100 --> 29:37.220
to black and queer in more than just that way. It's a word that encompasses a marginalized

29:37.220 --> 29:41.940
identity. Okay, so hold on a second, hold on a second. I gotta parse this properly here, okay?

29:43.220 --> 29:49.940
It's a marginalized identity so you're identifying as fat. Well, unlike black and for the most part

29:49.940 --> 29:56.500
unlike queer, you can just lose the weight and I mean presumably you're not going to be like a

29:56.500 --> 30:05.380
trans fat where you identify as skinny while you're fat or vice versa. Trans fat? Yeah dude.

30:10.260 --> 30:17.220
How fat is weaponized and the reclaiming of the word goes beyond size. Fat stigma is also tied to

30:17.220 --> 30:23.940
anti-blackness in that being black is the abundance that white supremacy seeks to shrink. What?

30:24.340 --> 30:24.840
How?

30:28.500 --> 30:36.900
So, does this mean that being a fat white guy, I'm no longer a white supremacist? Am I black

30:36.900 --> 30:44.420
now? Am I part of the abundance? My definition of fat is black as fuck, multi-dimensional

30:44.420 --> 30:49.700
and futuristic. I don't know, I don't know how futuristic. It might not last another five years.

30:50.500 --> 30:57.780
Fat means I exist. Fat means taking up space and demanding more. Fat means black. Fat means fuck

30:57.780 --> 31:03.540
you. Fat means human. Fat means creating a world full of possibility without shame.

31:04.100 --> 31:09.700
Fat means saying fuck you. It honestly sounds like the way that she writes it, fat means being

31:09.700 --> 31:14.900
a colonizer. Like you know how you see those pictures of like the really fat guy in a suit

31:14.900 --> 31:19.220
and it's like the capitalist and he just has like a ton of money and he's huge and like the

31:19.220 --> 31:24.980
working class is like a skeleton like just barely scraping by on like one coin. So when this person

31:24.980 --> 31:32.260
says fat means taking up space and demanding more, they're literally just like I want to be

31:32.260 --> 31:39.060
the oppressor class. How to have sex with a fat girl. Touch, and I cannot stress this enough,

31:39.060 --> 31:41.780
the fupa, this this picture.

31:44.420 --> 31:52.580
Hold on, what's a fupa? I don't know if I want to know. The fat upper pubic area.

31:58.180 --> 32:05.220
What? Oh my god, it's it's it's the gun. That's what it is. It's like that second stomach that

32:05.220 --> 32:12.420
kind of comes out in front of the pubic region. The first the first few times I fucked as a fat

32:12.420 --> 32:19.860
girl I exclusively wore my boyfriend's superman hoodie to hide my body. I was 16, a size 14 and

32:19.860 --> 32:27.380
it was 2009. Long before body positivity hit the mainstream or my tumblr feed. Now as a 26 year

32:27.380 --> 32:33.700
old woman wearing a size 20, sex has changed year after year as my body has gotten bigger and the

32:33.700 --> 32:40.340
dating pool has gotten smaller. With plus size partners, we can press our bellies together,

32:40.900 --> 32:47.620
grab each other's bodies and enjoy the thickness of our flesh in privacy. Touch the fupa.

32:48.660 --> 32:55.300
It's a universal truth known by fat girls that the fupa is the most intimidating part of our body.

32:55.940 --> 33:02.260
I know this because my fupa has been touched so little that I'm surprised she hasn't shriveled up

33:02.820 --> 33:11.220
and fallen off. The hottest the hottest hookups are the ones that grab my belly like it's a third

33:11.220 --> 33:17.620
tit. Kiss the flesh on the way down to the kitty and aren't pretending my body is less than it is.

33:24.900 --> 33:30.100
There's a lot of things I regret. I think at this point you kind of know where where all this is

33:30.100 --> 33:36.180
going. Diet culture and weight loss programs are a scam. Plus sized elf makes a joke of women's

33:36.180 --> 33:43.540
bodies. Two fat professors are afraid of COVID-19 causing fat phobia. Speaking about health is

33:43.540 --> 33:50.100
traumatizing for some who are impacted negatively by diet culture. Dear men, stop working out.

33:50.100 --> 33:54.740
Physical fitness creates a cycle of toxic masculinity that must be eradicated.

33:54.740 --> 34:01.460
On thinner bodies the strawberry TikTok dress skews a tiny bit fascist. I don't even need to

34:01.460 --> 34:06.100
like read the content of these articles. I'm pretty sure at this point you can just imagine

34:06.100 --> 34:13.220
what they say and you'll be right. The only way to be a proper BIPOC ally, to be anti-capitalist,

34:13.220 --> 34:18.980
anti-fascist is to simply be more abundantly obese. Everything in this video is factually

34:18.980 --> 34:22.420
correct by the way and if you disagree you simply haven't done enough research on the history of

34:22.420 --> 34:29.540
fatness. Stay mad. I don't know how much work I can take but fine. The obesity epidemic isn't

34:29.540 --> 34:33.380
real and it shouldn't be an anti-capitalist talking point. When someone unironically

34:33.380 --> 34:37.380
references the obesity epidemic or even uses the word obesity it tells me they really don't know

34:37.380 --> 34:40.980
what they're talking about when it comes to fatness. This use of the word obesity stems

34:40.980 --> 34:45.540
directly from the BMI which was created by a eugenicist with no medical training who based

34:45.540 --> 34:51.140
the scale only on white bodies and cow math. Fatness is not an epidemic. Fat people existed

34:51.140 --> 34:56.260
before capitalism and before colonization. Fatphobia is a direct result of anti-blackness

34:56.260 --> 35:00.260
and it has deadly consequences for many groups of indigenous folks and other people of color

35:00.260 --> 35:05.460
as well as fat folks. When you make the obesity epidemic a real symptom of capitalism you are not

35:05.460 --> 35:10.020
only ostracizing fat people from anti-capitalist thinking but also actively ignoring that the

35:10.020 --> 35:15.220
health outcomes related to obesity are more accurately attributed to food deserts and

35:15.220 --> 35:20.260
fatphobic discrimination in healthcare. The obesity epidemic was created by western medicine

35:20.260 --> 35:24.900
to avoid addressing the actual causes of health inequity which is what we as anti-capitalists

35:24.900 --> 35:33.380
should be doing. I would have to like spend the entire day talking about just how many things

35:33.380 --> 35:41.220
are wrong in this video. Not only factually but like viscerally. But let's focus on the

35:41.220 --> 35:45.220
food deserts thing because that's an important point and that leads us to the next topic of

35:45.220 --> 35:50.020
discussion and considering that we are currently talking about the wider political tent that

35:50.020 --> 35:55.780
constantly says trust the science believe the scientists there should be no objection to

35:55.780 --> 36:01.300
talking about science right? Because as it turns out that is not what happens with food desertification.

36:01.300 --> 36:07.700
Now what a food desert is is an area in like a large city where there's no grocery store so

36:07.700 --> 36:12.260
there's no place to actually buy fresh food you can only go to restaurants and fast food places

36:12.260 --> 36:17.300
and in places like that. But as reported on from the wall street journal what happens when new

36:17.300 --> 36:22.500
supermarkets open in food deserts? Not what you think. For years public health advocates have

36:22.500 --> 36:26.820
argued that food deserts neighborhoods without grocery stores or other fresh food vendors

36:26.820 --> 36:32.020
contribute to a disproportionate burden of obesity and chronic disease among low-income individuals.

36:32.580 --> 36:37.940
Ready access to fresh healthy food intuitively seems important for supporting a healthy diet

36:38.580 --> 36:43.540
but recent evidence contests the idea that watering america's food deserts will solve the obesity

36:43.540 --> 36:49.780
crisis. Compared with high-income individuals poor americans tend to have diets higher in sugar

36:50.340 --> 36:57.700
fat and processed foods and lower in fiber fruits and vegetables. This nutritional inequality is a

36:57.700 --> 37:02.980
contributor to the large income-based health disparities in the us and is thought to be due

37:02.980 --> 37:08.420
in part to more limited access to healthy food. But does introducing a supermarket into a food

37:08.420 --> 37:12.900
desert change the grocery habits of nearby residents? Not so much according to a recent

37:12.900 --> 37:19.140
study. Researchers found that less than one-tenth of the nutritional inequality between high and

37:19.140 --> 37:26.100
low-income households can be explained by the availability of healthy foods. The other 90% was

37:26.100 --> 37:34.260
due to differences in demand. So even when you give people who are overweight the option to buy

37:34.260 --> 37:39.620
healthy food they still don't do it. It's more than simply living in the ghetto and not having

37:39.620 --> 37:45.060
access. It is a deeper problem than that. This is fucking ridiculous. People aren't obese because

37:45.060 --> 37:51.380
there's junk food advertisements on before nine o'clock. People are obese because a pack of 20%

37:51.380 --> 37:58.740
fat mincemeat is $3.95 and a pack of 5% fat is $5.79. People are obese because a pack of biscuits

37:58.740 --> 38:05.540
is 20 pence and a pack of apples is two pounds. The actual problem seems to be a lack of knowledge

38:05.540 --> 38:13.140
about how diets work. Dietary fat does not equate into body fat. In fact you're much more likely to

38:13.140 --> 38:17.860
gain body fat from eating carbohydrates than you are from eating dietary fat and even then

38:17.860 --> 38:24.260
it's based more on how many calories you burn. How much exercise you're doing is calories in

38:24.260 --> 38:30.020
calories out. That's how it works. Your body does not violate the laws of thermodynamics.

38:30.020 --> 38:36.740
You are actually better off buying that pack of 20% fat meat over the 5% fat as long as you're

38:36.740 --> 38:43.140
also not eating an entire loaf of bread a day. The problem is sugar, it's carbs, it's gluten. That shit

38:43.140 --> 38:49.140
is just empty calories with no nutritional value that just makes you hungrier. And people just don't

38:49.140 --> 38:55.060
want to hear this even though it's the truth. Outrage as Whole Foods CEO says ignorance and

38:55.060 --> 39:01.540
poor choices cause obesity. It's the truth dude. Overweight and healthy is a big fat lie.

39:01.540 --> 39:05.940
Our findings refute the notion that a physically active lifestyle can completely negate the

39:05.940 --> 39:11.780
deleterious effects of being overweight and obesity. You cannot be fat and healthy at the

39:11.780 --> 39:18.340
same time. Even a fat person who you know lifts weights and runs and does all those things but is

39:18.340 --> 39:23.620
still fat they would be much healthier without all the body fat. In fact check this out check this out

39:23.620 --> 39:28.980
skinny jeans are the secret to staying slim. Oh shit is it all actually just genetics?

39:28.980 --> 39:34.100
Researchers found that people who were obese were more likely to have a set of genes linked to being

39:34.100 --> 39:40.180
overweight. Meanwhile people who were skinny not only had fewer genes linked to obesity

39:40.180 --> 39:47.700
but also changes in gene regions newly associated with healthy thinness. So of course as with

39:47.700 --> 39:53.220
everything in the human condition there is a genetic biological component. But I guarantee you

39:53.460 --> 39:57.700
take the obese person with obese genes and throw them under the wild and just have them

39:57.700 --> 40:03.860
starve they'll get thin. In fact a professor of nutrition and dietetics professor Tom Sanders

40:03.860 --> 40:09.060
said this is an important study confirming that precocious severe obesity is often genetically

40:09.060 --> 40:14.740
determined. But he also added most obesity is acquired in adult life and is linked to the

40:14.740 --> 40:19.460
environment we live in. A sedentary lifestyle and abundant access to calorie dense foods.

40:19.460 --> 40:25.460
Whatever your shape or genetic makeup the age-old advice of a healthy level of exercise and good

40:25.460 --> 40:32.100
diet still stands. This is an article that fat activists constantly cite and they've only ever

40:32.100 --> 40:36.500
read the headline and this is why you get shit like this. Does obesity really not cause any

40:36.500 --> 40:42.980
health problems? I never knew. What I say what we always say is that being fat is not proven to

40:42.980 --> 40:49.220
cause any illness only correlated with and that correlation is not causation is a basic principle

40:49.220 --> 40:54.500
of science. However many of the illnesses that are correlated with fatness are proven to cause

40:54.500 --> 40:59.220
weight gain or medications to treat them are. We also point out that there is no such thing as an

40:59.220 --> 41:04.500
illness that only fat people get. This is the problem with scientism and I'm going to have to do

41:05.220 --> 41:11.380
a video on science versus scientism at some point but basically if you have already ideologically

41:11.380 --> 41:16.660
predetermined your end point then you simply pick and choose all of the science that leads you there

41:16.660 --> 41:21.860
and ignore all the science that disagrees with you. Case in point fat sex therapist

41:21.860 --> 41:28.260
compares fitness trainers to nazis children dieting to sexual assault. I truly believe

41:28.260 --> 41:33.460
that a child cannot consent to being on a diet the same way a child cannot consent to having sex

41:33.460 --> 41:40.020
says Sonali Rashatwar who attends Saint Olaf College. Rashatwar also believes that science

41:40.020 --> 41:45.460
is white supremacist. We should be critical of the use of science and the production of knowledge

41:45.460 --> 41:50.740
to continue promoting this idea that certain bodies are fit able and desirable. Is it my

41:50.740 --> 41:56.660
fatness that causes my high blood pressure? Yes. Or is it my experience of weight stigma? It's

41:56.660 --> 42:01.380
definitely your fatness. She then connected the science suggesting that obesity is unhealthy to

42:01.380 --> 42:09.460
nazism saying that fat phobic science is often actually eugenic science. Eugenic science is nazi

42:09.460 --> 42:20.180
science. You know you can say the most unscientific shit but simply use a few of the

42:20.180 --> 42:26.900
words that some scientists have used in the past and then squint your eyes to make it real fuzzy

42:26.900 --> 42:32.340
and then it kind of seems scientific. Even when it comes to modern problems like the coronavirus

42:32.340 --> 42:37.220
COVID-19 death rates are 10 times higher in countries where most adults are overweight.

42:37.860 --> 42:42.420
There is a link between whether or not you're going to die of coronavirus and if you are fat.

42:42.980 --> 42:49.620
I am fat. To get the vaccine I had to say I'm obese. This word has done incredible damage to

42:49.620 --> 42:55.060
my body. No, the damage was probably done by the fourth Big Mac you had that day. I understand that

42:55.060 --> 43:00.580
doctors are including obese. Did you censor obesity? Oh my god. I understand that doctors

43:00.580 --> 43:06.660
are including obesity as an underlying medical condition that leads to death in COVID patients.

43:06.660 --> 43:10.740
Do these doctors have any idea what kind of impact this has on families to be told that

43:10.740 --> 43:14.740
their loved one's body shape is partly to blame for their death? The impact doesn't matter. It

43:14.740 --> 43:20.020
matters the truth. If you die because you're too fat it doesn't matter like the impact it has on

43:20.020 --> 43:24.580
your on your family. What matters is that you were too fat and you died because you were too fat.

43:24.580 --> 43:29.860
Furthermore when it comes to obesity and COVID deaths we have no evidence of causation and only

43:29.860 --> 43:34.900
a weak association that continues to be disproven as times goes by. No it doesn't. What are these

43:34.900 --> 43:40.340
junior doctors thinking? Give me one good reason for recording fatness as a cause of death. Well

43:41.700 --> 43:49.460
causes of death as we've seen recently with George Floyd and other have been very politicized as of

43:49.460 --> 43:54.740
late and I for one am happy to see someone actually telling the truth on these forms.

43:54.740 --> 44:00.020
What I've managed to pull from all of this though is that these people are screeching about fat

44:00.020 --> 44:06.180
acceptance from all possible angles. Cultural, scientific, representation, ideological,

44:06.180 --> 44:09.860
they're using politics, they're using critical theory, they're using socialist theory,

44:09.860 --> 44:16.740
they're using post-colonial theory, they're using everything that they can to basically turn fat and

44:16.740 --> 44:22.900
thin into another variation of white and non-white or something like that to create more classes and

44:22.900 --> 44:29.540
have them clash you know Marxist style. But the honest truth is when it comes to other alternative

44:29.540 --> 44:35.300
body types among the broader left there seems to be like a serious hit and miss right? White

44:35.300 --> 44:41.780
people calling fully grown Asian women cute is racist. No I will not explain. It's infantilizing

44:41.780 --> 44:48.660
as hell. Yeah I'm tired. I'd rather just be called ugly at this point. All right you're ugly.

44:48.660 --> 44:54.340
Aquaman looks hot because men want to be him. Carol Marcus looks hot because men want to fuck

44:54.340 --> 44:58.260
her. I don't even know who this guy is I keep seeing him on twitter and he seems to be like

44:58.260 --> 45:04.580
a grade-a moron. But dude dude do you see are you seriously saying that women don't want to

45:04.580 --> 45:09.780
fuck Jason Momoa? Lizzo, who the fuck is Lizzo? You know who cares? Lizzo talks about double

45:09.780 --> 45:14.420
standards for critiquing men's bodies versus women's. We don't talk about your dick sizes do we?

45:17.700 --> 45:23.860
13 male celebs with seriously big bulges. Cosmopolitan confirmed. Men who objectify

45:23.860 --> 45:29.620
women are effing horrible. Also cosmopolitan. 36 summer olympic bulges that deserve gold.

45:29.620 --> 45:36.260
How many times how many fucking times has there been like height shaming for men? I've done like

45:36.260 --> 45:42.020
a whole height shame video in the past and like you know dick size shaming. Even when the guy in

45:42.020 --> 45:47.460
question is tall and probably has like an average or even slightly above average dick size they'll

45:47.460 --> 45:51.300
simply throw that out there if they don't like what he's saying. It's like oh you like the wrong

45:51.300 --> 45:55.380
politics, you like the wrong sports teams, like the wrong video games, have the wrong opinions

45:55.380 --> 45:59.700
online, make fun of the wrong thing, make the wrong joke, whatever. Oh you're probably short

45:59.700 --> 46:05.620
and you have a tiny dick. Dude this shit happens everywhere and sometimes it's funny right like

46:05.620 --> 46:10.580
you see a guy who has like 10 guns or he has like a giant truck and it's like that guy's compensating

46:10.580 --> 46:17.540
hahaha like it's a joke all right and it's fine it's allowed but don't act like it doesn't happen.

46:17.540 --> 46:22.660
Do you recall Beachbody Ready? This was I think 2016 or something it was a while ago

46:22.660 --> 46:28.900
where London mayor Sadiq Khan banned this shit because it was apparently objectifying because

46:28.900 --> 46:33.140
it was a woman who was in shape and very clearly worked to get in shape. It was it was like a

46:33.140 --> 46:37.460
protein powder weight loss advertisement and everyone was like how dare you! On February

46:37.460 --> 46:44.420
10th of 2020 Sadiq Khan was proud to announce on his official twitter the Nubian skin advertisement

46:44.420 --> 46:50.740
which was just like an underwear advertisement and you'll notice it's four plus size women and

46:50.740 --> 46:56.900
two dudes with rippling abs. Where's the representation? Where's the outcry? The whole

46:56.900 --> 47:05.060
body positive argument falls apart as soon as you see how the left treats people with alternative

47:05.060 --> 47:10.980
body types when one they're not fat they're extremely skinny or they're in some other way

47:10.980 --> 47:18.820
different or two they're not leftists. It is extremely telling to me that when radical

47:18.820 --> 47:24.500
feminist male female whatever doesn't matter when they write about what looks are outdated

47:24.500 --> 47:30.660
or sexist or toxic it's always traditionally attractive people men and women alike and when

47:30.660 --> 47:36.900
they write about what's actually sexy amazing stunning brave and what should be pined after

47:36.900 --> 47:43.780
it just so happens to be how they look and it's generally kind of hideous and then when they bump

47:43.780 --> 47:50.020
into somebody who is in some way hideous in the exact way that they've written about but does not

47:50.020 --> 47:55.620
share their politics maybe they have some problem that is not socially acceptable to admit like you

47:55.620 --> 48:00.180
can go online and say you have all sorts of different mental problems but if you know if

48:00.180 --> 48:03.700
you're actually an incel like if you're someone who can't get a girlfriend and you're like depressed

48:03.700 --> 48:06.820
about it and you feel like the world's out to get you you're kind of on the lowest rung or the totem

48:06.820 --> 48:12.020
pole when it comes to men yeah body positivity doesn't apply to them body positivity doesn't

48:12.020 --> 48:18.340
apply to say short men or thin women or women who have suffered from anorexia or bulimia the rules

48:18.340 --> 48:25.700
that have been set out in this video are only valid if it helps that intersectional lefty cause

48:25.700 --> 48:30.980
which is why at least to me it seems like a big old bunch of bullshit and that being said whenever

48:30.980 --> 48:37.540
i see somebody demand something regarding body positivity i just laugh at them because i know

48:37.540 --> 48:41.860
that they're living hypocrites i'm still going to tell the same jokes i'm still going to laugh at

48:41.860 --> 48:47.140
the same things you're still going to be ridiculous when you complain that the new resident evil game

48:47.140 --> 48:51.620
has a fat guy and they're like how dare you link fatness with gluttony and it's like you do that

48:51.620 --> 48:56.580
every time you complain about capitalism and post a caricature so you know what i'm willing to bet

48:56.580 --> 49:00.900
that if you're actually out here talking about body positivity you're just a fucking hypocrite

49:00.900 --> 49:05.700
and there is no reason anyone should believe you and if you want to actually be body positive

49:05.700 --> 49:10.500
then encourage people to self-improve help the fat person at your local gym

49:10.500 --> 49:15.700
tell them they can make it because you know what we're all gonna make it bros for real
