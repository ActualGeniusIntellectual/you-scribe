WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.600
So, it's been one week, and I don't know if you guys have noticed, but Amazon still hasn't

00:08.600 --> 00:11.680
allowed anybody to put reviews up of this show.

00:11.680 --> 00:14.520
In a very long 72 hours.

00:14.520 --> 00:19.200
I've checked my review, and every time I check my review, it's like, oh, would you like to

00:19.200 --> 00:20.200
publish this?

00:20.200 --> 00:21.200
I'm like, yes, publish.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.240
I'm like, okay, we're publishing it.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.240
Refresh page.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.480
Would you like to publish this?

00:27.480 --> 00:29.560
Maybe reviews are having an effect.

00:29.560 --> 00:30.560
Amazon is scared.

00:30.560 --> 00:35.960
Like, they wouldn't do this if they wouldn't, because you gotta understand how bad this

00:35.960 --> 00:37.660
looks for the normies.

00:37.660 --> 00:38.660
Like hold on.

00:38.660 --> 00:39.660
Why can't I review this?

00:39.660 --> 00:41.360
Why are they holding reviews for 72 hours?

00:41.360 --> 00:42.860
It's been 72 hours.

00:42.860 --> 00:44.740
Why aren't there any reviews?

00:44.740 --> 00:47.640
Like the normies may be sheep, but they're not idiots.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.640
Yep.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.640
It's a big red flag.

00:49.640 --> 00:55.540
Well, do you guys think this will be like the Amy Schumer special where eventually Amazon

00:55.540 --> 01:00.260
just takes out the ability to review because of this?

01:00.260 --> 01:01.260
Like entirely?

01:01.260 --> 01:02.260
Like in perpetuity?

01:02.260 --> 01:03.260
Yeah.

01:03.260 --> 01:06.040
Oh jeez, that'd be funny.

01:06.040 --> 01:11.800
It might be, because it would avoid further headaches, but like it's already too late.

01:11.800 --> 01:18.860
The Rings of Power is a joke, and it is going to be held up as an example of like bad corporate

01:18.860 --> 01:21.060
production for a decade to come.

01:21.060 --> 01:22.300
Wait, what's all that clicking?

01:22.300 --> 01:24.660
Is it, are you like fidget spinning arch or something?

01:24.660 --> 01:29.620
I'm trying to hold it as far away from the microphone as I can, but I've got one of those

01:29.620 --> 01:33.140
grip trainers that I'm using to keep myself awake right now.

01:33.140 --> 01:34.140
Oh, that's right.

01:34.140 --> 01:35.820
We're doing this at 6 AM year time.

01:35.820 --> 01:36.820
Jesus.

01:36.820 --> 01:38.260
Oh my God, hang in there blondie.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.740
Somebody send that man a Coke.

01:40.740 --> 01:46.460
I have had two, but at this point I just need to do something and the grip trainer exhausts

01:46.460 --> 01:48.580
me enough to keep me awake.

01:48.580 --> 01:50.000
Jesus.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.960
So on the, the, the prime video site for Canada, it does show at the very least the IMDB score,

01:56.960 --> 01:57.960
which is 6.7% currently.

01:57.960 --> 01:58.960
Yep.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.960
It shows the same for US.

02:00.960 --> 02:01.960
Yeah.

02:01.960 --> 02:02.960
All right.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.160
And that is off the massive censorship.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.160
Yes.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.160
Jesus.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.160
That's, that's a pretty big oof.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.160
There's still person abuse by the way.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.160
Yeah.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.160
I'm not surprised.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.160
Arch, you and I both talked about hate watching.

02:12.160 --> 02:16.240
I mean, it turns out that putting out reviews does in fact have an effect.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.600
I think we were both correct on that.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.600
Yeah.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.600
Like obviously.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.800
You gotta remember the normies, their only real frame of reference is the reviews.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.100
Like they don't watch us.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.040
They don't even watch the mainstream media.

02:27.040 --> 02:31.580
They look at IMDB, they look at Rotten Tomatoes and okay, is this show good?

02:31.580 --> 02:35.040
And those that do look at reviews, notice that the market's been cornered because Amazon

02:35.040 --> 02:36.400
has removed the reviewing system.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.640
Well, now our reviews are even getting more hits than they otherwise would.

02:39.640 --> 02:40.640
Yep.

02:40.640 --> 02:41.640
And then they'll get suspicious.

02:41.640 --> 02:44.240
Like, hold on, why aren't there any reviews for this show?

02:44.240 --> 02:48.120
And then they might actually go to Google and go like rings of power reviews.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.020
And then the shit will pop up.

02:50.020 --> 02:51.600
Thank you algorithm.

02:51.600 --> 02:57.160
And speaking of actually watching it on Prime Video, I got raked over the coals last week

02:57.160 --> 03:00.960
for because of the fact that like we streamed it from Prime Video.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.980
Listen, I'm going to sell Kibs up the river right now.

03:03.980 --> 03:04.980
It wasn't me.

03:04.980 --> 03:07.040
Kibs is the one presenting this feed to you guys.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.400
I wouldn't watch this on Amazon.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.400
I would pirate this if I was going to do it.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.840
You can definitely blame me for it.

03:11.840 --> 03:12.840
No big deal.

03:12.840 --> 03:16.600
Like I use Amazon because I live out in the middle of Minnesota in the middle of nowhere,

03:16.600 --> 03:17.600
right?

03:18.080 --> 03:19.200
I saw a burn down.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.680
I'm not going to.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.080
So a few things have happened before we start, we'll just I just want to give you a couple

03:25.080 --> 03:26.880
of a little bit more context, okay?

03:26.880 --> 03:31.560
So in the week, the week since since we've all, you know, convened, and the end of reviews

03:31.560 --> 03:36.040
haven't been been allowed to be posted, we've started to see stuff like this, for example,

03:36.040 --> 03:38.120
Amazon's the rings of powers.

03:38.120 --> 03:46.720
The rings of powers is what the is what the article says, is not for purists or racists.

03:46.720 --> 03:53.600
And this article, yes, they're conflating people who care about Tolkien's lore and sticking

03:53.600 --> 03:55.700
to the story with racism.

03:55.700 --> 03:59.860
You might not like it if you're a purist or a racist.

03:59.860 --> 04:01.620
That's how you know a show's good.

04:01.620 --> 04:06.920
Like they have to fall behind that and just accuse anybody who might criticize it.

04:06.920 --> 04:11.680
Well, you just don't like my show because you're fucking racist.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.140
And hey, I admit, I do not like the diversity.

04:15.140 --> 04:20.340
And so far, the diversity has been the only real genuine sign of wokeism.

04:20.340 --> 04:24.820
But the thing is, I don't dislike the diversity, because they're brown.

04:24.820 --> 04:28.720
I dislike the diversity because there's a fantasy setting where they don't exist.

04:28.720 --> 04:30.420
And here's the thing too.

04:30.420 --> 04:35.020
Nothing is stopping them from making a story with a diverse cast.

04:35.020 --> 04:39.460
Like we mentioned the last time they have a village in the Southlands, like in an area

04:39.460 --> 04:42.740
that should be on the border of Rhun or Kandar.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.940
These people should be brown, and yet they are white.

04:46.940 --> 04:51.660
To your villages normally will, but you see, carrying about lower is a sign of racism,

04:51.660 --> 04:52.660
apparently.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.460
Yeah, we don't want that.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.140
So it's got to be an ethnostate village.

04:56.140 --> 05:00.980
See, I had this talk about the light tier movie and the lesbian kids, because a lot

05:00.980 --> 05:02.780
of people are up in arms about that.

05:02.780 --> 05:06.100
And I looked, I was like, this is nothing like it's a loving family.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.180
It's a quick peck on the lips.

05:07.180 --> 05:08.180
This is not a problem.

05:08.180 --> 05:09.180
Yeah.

05:09.180 --> 05:15.780
I don't remember who put it in there, and suddenly it's not just a loving family and

05:15.780 --> 05:16.780
a peck on the lips.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.420
It is the agenda.

05:18.420 --> 05:19.980
There's a reason why it's there.

05:19.980 --> 05:21.820
I still think that wasn't a big deal, to be honest.

05:21.820 --> 05:22.820
It's just whatever.

05:22.820 --> 05:23.980
They didn't do anything with it.

05:23.980 --> 05:24.980
It's okay for me.

05:24.980 --> 05:26.820
It doesn't bother me in the slightest.

05:26.820 --> 05:29.620
I just dislike the underhanded nature.

05:29.620 --> 05:33.220
If they just have it in there and it's like, oh, it's just a thing that happens in the

05:33.220 --> 05:34.220
story.

05:34.220 --> 05:35.220
Not a big deal.

05:35.220 --> 05:39.440
They're only depicting female on female lesbian relationships.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.720
We need full on male, male gay sex.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.840
That's that's what you know.

05:43.840 --> 05:45.340
They're truly brave.

05:45.340 --> 05:47.260
And they got to play it in Saudi Arabia.

05:47.260 --> 05:48.260
Yes.

05:48.260 --> 05:50.260
No, zero censorship.

05:50.260 --> 05:59.120
Well, in the face of all of this racism and all of these racist negative reviews, we had

05:59.120 --> 06:04.860
the official Twitter account of the show post, we stand in solidarity with our cast.

06:05.540 --> 06:10.740
They're doing the same thing that was done in regards to Moses Ingram for the Kenobi

06:10.740 --> 06:15.260
show and every show right now that's getting blasted for being just a terrible piece of

06:15.260 --> 06:16.260
shit.

06:16.260 --> 06:18.260
This always ends up happening, right?

06:18.260 --> 06:21.300
The official Twitter account comes out, posts a big, long diatribe.

06:21.300 --> 06:25.580
Everyone's cheering it on and going, yes, Queen Slakes, it's fucking Twitter and it's

06:25.580 --> 06:26.740
a garbage pile.

06:26.740 --> 06:29.540
You can almost predict these things.

06:29.540 --> 06:33.120
It's like you're in the Matrix and you can just see all of it instead of the code.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.120
You can see exactly what they're going to do exactly what they're going to say before

06:36.120 --> 06:37.120
it even happens.

06:37.120 --> 06:42.400
Well, you can see anybody can see it from a while away is this like it's the go to for

06:42.400 --> 06:45.960
any big corporate project, especially Disneyland.

06:45.960 --> 06:50.920
In relation to all of this, did you guys see the new Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power

06:50.920 --> 06:51.920
merch?

06:51.920 --> 06:52.920
No, I haven't.

06:52.920 --> 06:57.660
Amazon got together the four original actors for the hobbits, the four hobbits, and they're

06:57.660 --> 07:04.500
peddling these hats and T-shirts that say in Elvish, you are all welcome here.

07:04.500 --> 07:09.540
And then it shows a bunch of different ears, human ears and elf ears of all different colors.

07:09.540 --> 07:13.700
That's the dumbest and boringest thing I think I've ever heard from merch.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.820
It's the cringiest fucking thing I've seen in a while.

07:17.820 --> 07:24.220
Like, not like cool little figurines or soldiers or action characters or maybe like a cool

07:24.220 --> 07:27.020
comic or something that looks atrocious.

07:27.020 --> 07:30.900
That looks so sad.

07:30.900 --> 07:35.780
So if you want to support Rings of Power, you got to buy this T-shirt or else you're

07:35.780 --> 07:37.020
one of the racists.

07:37.020 --> 07:40.580
They also look so old and sad.

07:40.580 --> 07:43.660
Like they don't look like they won't even be there.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.660
It doesn't even jump out and scream.

07:45.660 --> 07:47.100
This is Lord of the Rings.

07:47.100 --> 07:50.260
Come on, Kibs, thirty nine ninety nine.

07:50.260 --> 07:55.060
Show your fucking nine ninety nine for that.

07:55.060 --> 08:02.820
Are you shitting me for a shitty shirt that has some sort of stains on it?

08:02.820 --> 08:09.820
I also need to point out that just like the Riva thing, Ismael Cruz, the black elf, also

08:09.820 --> 08:15.900
had on day one on launch the announcement that he was receiving racist hatred.

08:15.900 --> 08:21.460
Yeah, in fact, I remember that because I said this again in my Kenobi video where Disney

08:21.460 --> 08:26.900
basically told Moses Ingram, you're going to get racist shit for this.

08:26.900 --> 08:31.160
And we're kind of counting on it because that becomes a really good headline.

08:31.160 --> 08:36.220
Please tell us as soon as you get anything, man, we really are at the point where it's

08:36.220 --> 08:42.700
like in order to help the grand political project, you must watch the worst fucking

08:42.700 --> 08:45.180
dog shit TV imaginable.

08:45.180 --> 08:49.700
And if nothing else, it will send yet another loud and clear message to Amazon, because

08:49.700 --> 08:53.500
also the various companies have been turning again.

08:53.500 --> 08:58.380
I keep saying you can't give up just because it didn't happen instantly, that all of these

08:58.380 --> 09:00.460
companies went unwoke instantly.

09:00.460 --> 09:04.920
It takes months and years for them to do anything.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.860
And at the end of the day, it's very simple.

09:06.860 --> 09:11.780
Reward good stuff, punish bad stuff, and sooner or later, the message will shine through.

09:11.780 --> 09:16.260
Well, I think it's time for this episode to shine through you guys.

09:16.260 --> 09:17.260
You guys ready?

09:17.260 --> 09:18.260
No.

09:18.260 --> 09:19.260
Nope.

09:19.820 --> 09:28.300
Lord of the Rings, Rings of Power, season one, episode three, Adar, Adar, Adar, I think

09:28.300 --> 09:32.260
this might be the corrupted elf we heard about.

09:32.260 --> 09:33.260
Let's roll.

09:33.260 --> 09:35.140
All right.

09:35.140 --> 09:41.180
So I keep hearing that this guy might not be Sauron, but Gandalf, Mauler was telling

09:41.180 --> 09:42.180
me that.

09:43.100 --> 09:50.060
If it is, that would be an even bigger lore break than it being Sauron, because Gandalf

09:50.060 --> 09:54.020
is alive right now, like he's in the other land to the west.

09:54.020 --> 09:55.020
He's a person.

09:55.020 --> 09:58.940
Like he went to Middle Earth on a mission, along with the other wizards.

09:58.940 --> 10:01.100
He didn't just fucking dump there one day.

10:01.100 --> 10:07.140
Yeah, it could be, see, I could see it being a red herring because it's too obvious, but

10:07.140 --> 10:14.340
it's one of the things where like, okay, then who is?

10:14.340 --> 10:15.340
Maybe they just killed them.

10:15.340 --> 10:16.780
Maybe we'll never see him again.

10:16.780 --> 10:17.780
Wouldn't that be lovely?

10:17.780 --> 10:18.780
That would be nice.

10:18.780 --> 10:21.860
You want me to skip the intro, by the way, I can if you want.

10:21.860 --> 10:26.780
Dev likes the intro, doesn't he?

10:26.780 --> 10:31.240
This is something else that shows do these days where they're like, they make things

10:31.240 --> 10:36.720
like this to be epic because they somehow believe that they deserve it.

10:36.720 --> 10:41.460
They haven't achieved anything yet, and it's like, oh my God, look at this.

10:41.460 --> 10:45.560
It was also popularized by Game of Thrones with that, honestly, really good opening intro

10:45.560 --> 10:49.200
with all of the clockwork machinations and shit, and now everyone does it.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.200
Yeah.

10:50.200 --> 10:54.360
Well, to be fair, House of the Dragon's doing a kind of decent one, but it's like flowing

10:54.360 --> 10:55.360
wax or something.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.360
I think it's blood.

10:56.360 --> 10:57.360
What, I'd imagine.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.360
You think it's blood?

10:58.360 --> 10:59.360
Yeah.

10:59.360 --> 11:04.360
Well, the entire idea of the Targaryens is that, you know, their blood is special.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.360
Yeah, I guess.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.860
But of the Targaryens' fluid.

11:07.860 --> 11:14.480
The orcs have elected to not kill their arch enemy, the elf, for some reason.

11:14.480 --> 11:17.220
That's because they're actually misunderstood, okay?

11:17.220 --> 11:24.440
Here we have the Ku Klux Klan orcs in their hoods.

11:24.440 --> 11:28.520
Yeah, why are they all wearing hoods?

11:28.520 --> 11:35.560
Because it makes them look more KKK-ish.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.560
What's the entire garrison?

11:36.560 --> 11:37.560
Oh my God.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.560
What the fuck happened?

11:38.560 --> 11:39.560
What the fuck?

11:39.560 --> 11:40.560
They're still in Navjd.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.560
What the fuck?

11:41.560 --> 11:42.560
They suck.

11:42.560 --> 11:46.600
So we let them dance for us alive.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.900
You guys were soldiers.

11:47.900 --> 11:50.400
You had weapons in the tower.

11:50.400 --> 11:55.320
What happened, and why didn't we see that?

11:55.320 --> 11:58.680
Alright, well, now we know why she didn't run to the garrison, because the garrison

11:58.680 --> 12:01.680
was already run by elf-time orcs.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.040
From before this guy saw her own.

12:04.040 --> 12:05.920
Is it Black Queen time?

12:05.920 --> 12:07.920
I didn't know the new middle-eastern universe.

12:07.920 --> 12:14.680
Well, you know, it's the modern day.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.880
My dagger.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.560
My ice-climbing pick.

12:19.560 --> 12:23.760
Oh, time for some more grand CGI, I think.

12:23.760 --> 12:29.240
So is it just me, or does she only have one facial expression this entire show?

12:29.240 --> 12:31.240
Constantly petulant, yes.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.360
It's like women aren't allowed to express themselves anymore.

12:34.360 --> 12:35.360
Slightly constipated.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.360
Slightly constipated.

12:36.360 --> 12:39.360
And here's the thing, you can do that kind of a character.

12:39.360 --> 12:45.280
You can do, like, the female hero from Kill La Kill or something, but it doesn't work

12:45.280 --> 12:46.280
with Galadriel.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.280
That's kind of the point.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.280
She has a character, yeah.

12:49.280 --> 12:58.720
Other than, like, Ryoko from Kill La Kill, her emotion was at least vivid, anger, just

12:58.720 --> 13:04.960
anger, whereas she's just kind of mildly annoyed at everything around her.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.040
Again, it's a strong female character.

13:07.040 --> 13:10.760
The chick from House of the Dragon's the same, frumpy.

13:10.760 --> 13:13.740
That seems to be the emotion of strong female character.

13:13.740 --> 13:15.000
Like Rey, too.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
Constantly petulant.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Look, she has to deal with men, okay?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
That's enough.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
We should tell Galadriel to smile more.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Oof.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Cancelled.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
In the Great Wall, your ancestors stood with Morgoth.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
How the fuck do you know his ancestry?

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Do you smell it on him?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
As a reward, the Valar granted on this island.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.880
Hold on, I'm noticing this now.

13:37.880 --> 13:41.120
She's rolling every single R when it's a foreign word.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.820
It feels like, this is going to be a Canadian joke, it feels like she's rolling up the rim

13:43.820 --> 13:44.820
to win.

13:44.820 --> 13:50.820
So Sauron is already here, because he's turning them against the elves.

13:50.820 --> 13:55.940
I think as time drifted, I don't remember, but I believe the Numenoreans did drift apart

13:55.940 --> 13:56.940
from the elves.

13:56.940 --> 14:00.820
Yeah, but a lot of that was specifically Sauron.

14:00.820 --> 14:07.500
Because Sauron comes into play off the whole thing about like, oh, Valar, they're denying

14:07.500 --> 14:09.660
you, the immortality.

14:09.660 --> 14:16.880
Well, some people are saying that this guy is Sauron.

14:16.880 --> 14:22.020
This guy, I could see it, it would be really cringe, but I could see it.

14:22.020 --> 14:25.400
And they're going to do like a Galadriel-Sauron romance.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.980
Oh, stop.

14:26.980 --> 14:28.620
Where she gets betrayed.

14:28.620 --> 14:31.100
I don't think they would do that.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.960
The worst part is I can see it.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.960
I don't want to.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.960
It could be bad if he did.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.960
You're near the fuck.

14:40.960 --> 14:41.960
Ew.

14:41.960 --> 14:42.960
Gross.

14:42.960 --> 14:43.960
Untermich.

14:43.960 --> 14:48.960
Wait, he was checking her out.

14:48.960 --> 14:49.960
Sure.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.960
I mean, she's still wearing the bathrobe they found her in.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.960
Oh my god.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.960
Ah, yes, the Black Queen of the Numenoreans.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.960
Smelt nasty in there.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.960
Another one was black.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.960
Every R, man.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.960
Yes, she does it all every goddamn R.

15:16.960 --> 15:17.960
He's Sauron.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.960
Look at how charismatic he is.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.960
We can't have a competent male.

15:21.960 --> 15:25.960
I am still not sure that the show isn't going to do a Witcher thing and turn out that there's

15:25.960 --> 15:27.960
like five fucking Saurons.

15:27.960 --> 15:31.960
Well, I'm going to go to bed then.

15:31.960 --> 15:32.960
He does have to be evil.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.960
He's going to be evil, yeah.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.960
For longer than you know.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.960
He is raising some flags, it's true.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.960
Sounds like I want to get a little bit, you know, just a little something before I become

15:47.960 --> 15:49.960
a Dark Lord.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.960
Is he someone we should know?

15:55.960 --> 15:57.960
That's Isildur.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.960
The guy we're just seeing there in that scene a second ago.

16:00.960 --> 16:01.960
Yep.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.960
Elendil's son is Isildur.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.960
Right, the guy who ends up with the one ring in the intro of Fellowship.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.960
Yep, correct.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.960
It's a time for Isildur to celebrate his bravery.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.960
Prove you're not just a nepotism hire.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.960
Those sales are very stupid, I just want to point that out.

16:20.960 --> 16:24.960
Sometimes the cinematography makes me think this might be a good show.

16:24.960 --> 16:28.960
And then I am reminded by what we're watching.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.960
The sea is always right.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.960
The sea is a cairn.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.960
There you are.

16:36.960 --> 16:37.960
Jesus.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.960
Those are some Shapiro milkers.

16:42.960 --> 16:43.960
Wait, hold on.

16:43.960 --> 16:48.960
Are they persecuting him based on his last name?

16:48.960 --> 16:49.960
Yep.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.960
So in the lore, didn't Numenor sink into the ocean?

16:52.960 --> 16:53.960
Yes.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.960
They broke a man.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.960
Yeah, it's basically just like...

17:01.960 --> 17:02.960
Atlantis.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.960
Yes, that's what I was thinking of. Atlantis.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.960
And then the Numenoreans became the kings of Gondor.

17:12.960 --> 17:16.960
Are all of the orcs just pale white now?

17:19.960 --> 17:21.960
Yeah, they were black skinned before, weren't they?

17:21.960 --> 17:22.960
Yeah.

17:22.960 --> 17:27.960
Not necessarily uniformly black, but they certainly weren't that white.

17:32.960 --> 17:36.960
Very educated orcs, too. Very smooth-spoken.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.960
I recently watched all three of the original movies with Naomi,

17:39.960 --> 17:45.960
and they basically seemed like anarchists that Sauron whipped into shape, but only temporarily.

17:45.960 --> 17:50.960
I mean, they're intended to be wild and animalistic, brutish.

17:50.960 --> 17:51.960
Gonna get it.

17:58.960 --> 17:59.960
Oh, Jesus.

18:00.960 --> 18:01.960
Okay.

18:01.960 --> 18:03.960
I mean, one of them was gonna die, you could tell.

18:03.960 --> 18:04.960
Yeah.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.960
Also, that is not bleeding much for a fucking neck wood.

18:08.960 --> 18:09.960
I mean, he's not dead, dude.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.960
What the fuck? He's not dead.

18:11.960 --> 18:12.960
Nope, he's dead.

18:12.960 --> 18:13.960
He's barely bleeding.

18:13.960 --> 18:14.960
He's fine.

18:14.960 --> 18:15.960
I mean, he's dead.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.960
I've had worse shaving accidents.

18:18.960 --> 18:23.960
Listen, elves only have a little bit of blood in them, alright?

18:25.960 --> 18:26.960
Apparently.

18:26.960 --> 18:27.960
He's not dead.

18:27.960 --> 18:28.960
No, don't leave him.

18:28.960 --> 18:29.960
He's not...

18:29.960 --> 18:30.960
Never fucking mind.

18:30.960 --> 18:31.960
He's dead now.

18:31.960 --> 18:32.960
He's dead.

18:32.960 --> 18:33.960
Dad shows us he's dead.

18:34.960 --> 18:35.960
Okay.

18:35.960 --> 18:36.960
Very well, TV show.

18:37.960 --> 18:38.960
That is a very stupid axe.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.960
And also, it's like, okay, great job.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.960
Now you have less people to cut down on trees.

18:45.960 --> 18:49.960
Could Amazon not afford the ketchup?

18:50.960 --> 18:52.960
They're gonna be there a while, dude.

18:52.960 --> 18:53.960
Takes a lot to cut down on trees.

18:53.960 --> 18:54.960
Yeah.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.960
At least the orcs don't like being in the sun.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.960
Except for the fact that they were standing in the sun.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.960
Except for when they do, yes.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.960
See, I was gonna compliment them on that touch.

19:05.960 --> 19:06.960
I was like, oh, you know that.

19:06.960 --> 19:07.960
And then they do that.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.960
As they're all standing in the sun, like, yeah, it's whatever.

19:12.960 --> 19:13.960
Show.

19:13.960 --> 19:14.960
Yeah.

19:14.960 --> 19:15.960
Hide your ears.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.960
It's the only identifiable feature of an elf.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.960
At least in this universe, where they're just humans.

19:20.960 --> 19:25.960
Yeah, I guess if you were an elf on a stealth mission, and it were, you know, not this show,

19:25.960 --> 19:27.960
you'd just be glowing down the hallway.

19:27.960 --> 19:28.960
It's like, oops.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.960
Fucking bloodthirsty.

19:33.960 --> 19:34.960
Yeah.

19:34.960 --> 19:35.960
Jesus.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.960
Immediate jumps, I'm gonna fucking kill you.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.960
I guess she likes riding horses.

19:46.960 --> 19:47.960
Caleb.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.960
Also, I wanna point out something as well here.

19:50.960 --> 19:55.960
Uh, Elendil was called Elendil the Tall as one of his names because he was like two and

19:55.960 --> 19:57.960
a half meters.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.960
Well, maybe they couldn't quite do that.

20:03.960 --> 20:07.960
I mean, they can't make the hobbits look small, so I guess it would be difficult to make him

20:07.960 --> 20:08.960
look tall.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.960
Quit pointing out these things, Arch, okay?

20:12.960 --> 20:14.960
Well, who the fuck are you gonna get to play him?

20:14.960 --> 20:15.960
Yao Ming?

20:15.960 --> 20:16.960
Yes.

20:16.960 --> 20:20.960
Well, the thing is, in the Lord of the Rings movies, they managed to use tricks to make

20:20.960 --> 20:23.960
the characters look taller or smaller.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.960
Oh god, is that Galadriel's smile?

20:26.960 --> 20:27.960
Please, go back.

20:27.960 --> 20:28.960
Yes.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.960
Go back to, go back to being grumpy.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.960
We need to not know what we asked for.

20:32.960 --> 20:33.960
No, what the fuck?

20:33.960 --> 20:34.960
Stop.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.960
Actually, that's kinda great.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.960
Like, she looks like a fucking shark smile.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.960
I bet it looks sadistic and evil.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.960
It's better than just having her perma-skull for the entire show.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.960
Yeah, I guess maybe.

20:47.960 --> 20:48.960
I don't know.

20:49.960 --> 20:50.960
Where did he get money from?

20:50.960 --> 20:52.960
He probably pick-pocketed it.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.960
He's stealing from everyone.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.960
Did your guild seal?

20:58.960 --> 20:59.960
No, no, the seal.

21:01.960 --> 21:02.960
He doesn't give a fuck.

21:02.960 --> 21:03.960
That's funny.

21:03.960 --> 21:04.960
Oh, they're mad.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.960
He's too charismatic!

21:08.960 --> 21:10.960
You know what?

21:10.960 --> 21:15.960
I will say he's at least, like, interesting in a way that the first two episodes weren't.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.960
Yep, and there goes the Guild of Crests.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.960
He just, he's sniping it.

21:20.960 --> 21:21.960
Yep.

21:21.960 --> 21:22.960
He's got it.

21:22.960 --> 21:26.960
I mean, he's the, he's, yeah, no, he's better than Disa.

21:26.960 --> 21:30.960
He's the most interesting character so far, just because I can't tell if he's just a lovable

21:30.960 --> 21:32.960
rogue or something.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.960
He's too, he's too good.

21:35.960 --> 21:40.960
I'm hoping he's just a lovable rogue, because it just would be more interesting.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.960
Oh, they noticed.

21:43.960 --> 21:44.960
Darn.

21:46.960 --> 21:50.960
I mean, your captain didn't notice lifting a fucking dagger off him, so.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.960
Because apparently he's ridiculously good at fighting.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.960
Charismatic.

22:01.960 --> 22:02.960
Very.

22:02.960 --> 22:03.960
Oh!

22:03.960 --> 22:04.960
Nice.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.960
Ridiculously strong.

22:06.960 --> 22:07.960
Fucking rude.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.960
I think he is strong.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.960
I mean, that's not human strength.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.960
That was, that was the entire fucking arm bone there.

22:16.960 --> 22:17.960
That was quick.

22:17.960 --> 22:18.960
Self-defense.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.960
At least, at least the police force is good.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.960
Quick response time.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.960
There's no Second Amendment on Numenor, though.

22:26.960 --> 22:27.960
True.

22:27.960 --> 22:28.960
There's a lot of scrolls.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.960
You'd think they'd have books by now.

22:31.960 --> 22:34.960
Yeah, but scrolls are more fancy and old-timey.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.960
Yeah, I guess so.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.960
Oh, there's a book.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.960
There's a few books.

22:40.960 --> 22:47.960
Well, they combine books and scrolls for the worst possible keep-a-jib knowledge.

22:47.960 --> 22:48.960
Good.

22:48.960 --> 22:53.960
They haven't made, they haven't made the transition fully over yet.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.960
They got one guy copying it and used it really slowly.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.960
Yeah, the Numenor story has been...

22:59.960 --> 23:02.960
...accelerated.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.960
I don't mind it.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.960
Stuff's actually happening.

23:06.960 --> 23:08.960
Better than the Harvards.

23:08.960 --> 23:09.960
Wait.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.960
I'm confused as to where the Southlands is.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.960
Is the Southlands Mordor?

23:14.960 --> 23:15.960
Yes.

23:15.960 --> 23:16.960
That's what it looks like.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.960
Yeah, it kind of does.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.960
Why'd you write that down?

23:21.960 --> 23:22.960
Ah.

23:22.960 --> 23:23.960
Yes.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.960
Sauron was like, hmm, my god might lose.

23:27.960 --> 23:30.960
I should make a contingency plan.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.960
Hands out the world map.

23:32.960 --> 23:33.960
Yep.

23:33.960 --> 23:39.960
Well, we already know that he succeeds because the Southlands become Mordor.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.960
Well, yeah, that's kind of the problem.

23:42.960 --> 23:46.960
And in that case, it is on the border of goddamn Run and Kandahan, etc.

23:46.960 --> 23:47.960
Like, Kandahar.

23:47.960 --> 23:48.960
Khan.

23:48.960 --> 23:49.960
Khan?

23:49.960 --> 23:50.960
Kar.

23:50.960 --> 23:51.960
What's the name of the Eastern Kingdom?

23:51.960 --> 23:58.960
Wasn't after the war, though, didn't a bunch of people settle there from different regions that fought alongside the elves?

23:58.960 --> 24:00.960
Or no?

24:00.960 --> 24:02.960
Not that far, I think.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.960
Like, that's well beyond the original borders of Gondor.

24:05.960 --> 24:10.960
No, Gondor actually occasionally occupied a fair portion of Mordor.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.960
Yeah, but remember the Black Gate was their fortress.

24:13.960 --> 24:15.960
I don't think they'd be that deep.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.960
Wait, why do the hobbits have pterodactyl suits?

24:18.960 --> 24:20.960
Why do they look like African tribals?

24:20.960 --> 24:24.960
Because, Dev, it's their cultural heritage.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.960
Oh, they even do the dancy thing.

24:30.960 --> 24:31.960
Yep.

24:46.960 --> 24:47.960
Imagine doing this for hours.

24:47.960 --> 24:48.960
Yeah.

24:48.960 --> 24:52.960
Like, it looks like it's supposed to be a celebration, but you have two lines.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.960
Like, at that point, it just sounds like indoctrination.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.960
Well, or an activist chant.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.960
Whose streets are streets?

25:00.960 --> 25:02.960
You have carts.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.960
Like, why is his ankle a problem?

25:04.960 --> 25:08.960
This society isn't very intelligent.

25:08.960 --> 25:16.960
The hobbit's gonna be like, okay, if you can't walk, we're not gonna carry you, we're not gonna put you in a stretcher or in a wagon, we're gonna leave your ass.

25:16.960 --> 25:21.960
Also, please push, take the goddamn nuts out of your hair, Jesus Christ, why?

25:21.960 --> 25:27.960
Oh, now, see, I've been at that point for a while where I see their hair and I'm like, that's just stupid.

25:27.960 --> 25:28.960
What if...

25:28.960 --> 25:33.960
Look, it's all camouflage, it makes sense in the lore, I think.

25:33.960 --> 25:39.960
No, no, wait, what if they actually grow in their heads?

25:39.960 --> 25:44.960
Because they're forest spirits, so they have, like, branches growing out of their skulls.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.960
I hate their hair so much.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.960
She's independent.

25:48.960 --> 25:53.960
Actually, okay, from the back, you can kind of see the fake plastic stems.

25:53.960 --> 26:01.960
I was almost enjoying myself there for a moment, but now, we're back here.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.960
How many independent female characters, Barge?

26:03.960 --> 26:05.960
You got a problem, Dan?

26:05.960 --> 26:07.960
Just annoying.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.960
There.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.960
What is she wearing?

26:12.960 --> 26:16.960
I don't know, whatever shit she rolled in.

26:16.960 --> 26:20.960
Can you even read? Is that common amongst the Harfoots?

26:20.960 --> 26:27.960
The Harfoots have developed a written language, yet they still rely on images.

26:27.960 --> 26:33.960
And also, they're writing in books, while the Numenoreans still have a bunch of scrolls.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.960
That's a good point.

26:35.960 --> 26:39.960
They have books too, but mostly sort of scrolls.

26:39.960 --> 26:45.960
The Harfoots are more technologically advanced than the Numenoreans.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.960
Don't you like how quirky they are?

26:48.960 --> 26:49.960
Love it.

26:49.960 --> 26:54.960
You know, if I was ten, I would have really enjoyed that scene.

26:54.960 --> 26:55.960
You would have?

26:55.960 --> 26:56.960
Yes.

26:56.960 --> 26:57.960
Really?

26:57.960 --> 26:59.960
I can see it.

26:59.960 --> 27:02.960
As a little kid, I never liked this sort of stuff.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.960
But I guess that's the target audience.

27:05.960 --> 27:13.960
You know, the raging fire and the alcohol somewhat undermines the whole camouflage idea of these people.

27:13.960 --> 27:14.960
Yep.

27:14.960 --> 27:15.960
Yeah.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.960
They're brightly lit encampments. They're stealthy.

27:18.960 --> 27:22.960
Millions of fireflies they probably have to gather.

27:22.960 --> 27:26.960
They have captured a lot of fireflies.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.960
Cultivate them.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.960
They just have, like, firefly farms.

27:31.960 --> 27:32.960
Yeah.

27:34.960 --> 27:40.960
They likewise will be carried with us in our hearts and in our memories.

27:40.960 --> 27:45.960
But their broken bodies will be left behind because we're savages like that.

27:45.960 --> 27:50.960
We will just leave them to death.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.960
Oh hey, it's Sauron.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.960
You mean Gandalf?

27:55.960 --> 27:58.960
Nope, there's going to be, like, eighty Saurons.

27:58.960 --> 28:01.960
I like that one.

28:01.960 --> 28:02.960
Gross.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.960
Actually, you know what they'll do?

28:05.960 --> 28:10.960
They'll make this guy one of the two blue wizards that didn't really have a story.

28:10.960 --> 28:11.960
Oh, the blues.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.960
Yeah, but they arrived along with the rest of them.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.960
Like, they all arrived at the same time.

28:17.960 --> 28:19.960
He's a wizard.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.960
They're a wizard, Harry.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.960
All the Harfoots are right there.

28:23.960 --> 28:27.960
Yeah, but they're bees.

28:28.960 --> 28:32.960
You got stung a lot, I guess.

28:32.960 --> 28:33.960
Oh, she'll notice.

28:33.960 --> 28:36.960
They'll laugh because he got stunned to death.

28:36.960 --> 28:37.960
I called that close.

28:37.960 --> 28:38.960
Dude, you're burning!

28:38.960 --> 28:40.960
He's like, oh, shoot.

28:40.960 --> 28:42.960
I needed more light to see, okay?

28:42.960 --> 28:44.960
I'm really nearsighted.

28:44.960 --> 28:53.960
Now, don't mind me as I set fire to the entire encampment and, uh...

28:53.960 --> 28:56.960
Oops.

28:56.960 --> 28:59.960
Laugh track.

29:10.960 --> 29:13.960
Nori!

29:13.960 --> 29:15.960
Everyone's gonna turn their heads towards her.

29:15.960 --> 29:16.960
And she's gonna get...

29:16.960 --> 29:17.960
How dare you?

29:17.960 --> 29:19.960
She's gonna get exiled.

29:19.960 --> 29:25.960
It's gonna be like a Princess Mononoke thing where she's thrown out of the tribe, eh?

29:27.960 --> 29:29.960
Oh, Shell, this gang.

29:29.960 --> 29:33.960
They really will not wait for her.

29:33.960 --> 29:34.960
Oh, my God.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.960
Can we go back to the sea people already?

29:36.960 --> 29:38.960
They're doing Frodo, guys.

29:38.960 --> 29:39.960
Can you feel it?

29:39.960 --> 29:41.960
It's Frodo.

29:41.960 --> 29:42.960
Femdo.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.960
Femdo?

29:48.960 --> 29:50.960
I mean, blue wizard's dead.

29:50.960 --> 29:53.960
That's actually just me looking at my monetization.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.960
Hey, they're talking about the franchise.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.960
Are they?

29:59.960 --> 30:01.960
Yeah, the past is dead.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.960
Oh, shoot, if you have to.

30:05.960 --> 30:06.960
I didn't pick up on it.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.960
It's too late.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.960
It's too late in the evening.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.960
That's quite the statue, Jesus.

30:24.960 --> 30:28.960
Oh, they're just gonna do the Aragorn story again.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.960
Literally just Sargon.

30:41.960 --> 30:45.960
Just a few questions as to how Galadriel just walked into jail.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.960
Like, there's no guard stopping her.

30:47.960 --> 30:48.960
She's just fine.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.960
She's got the right to do this now.

30:51.960 --> 30:54.960
Listen, Arch, the Elfa Sea unlocks a lot of doors, okay?

30:54.960 --> 30:59.960
Ooh, maybe it will actually be Sauragorn.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.960
And he'll be, like, mentally conflicted.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.960
Like, should I be Sauron?

31:04.960 --> 31:07.960
It's like, I really like Galadriel, though, like a lot.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.960
Yeah, Galadriel convinces him to become Sauron.

31:11.960 --> 31:13.960
Actually, you have to be king.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.960
Do I? Yes, okay.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.960
If that'll win you over, does it?

31:17.960 --> 31:19.960
I don't want to be with you anymore.

31:19.960 --> 31:20.960
What the fuck, woman?

31:20.960 --> 31:22.960
You're evil now, Jesus.

31:22.960 --> 31:23.960
Woman.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.960
I'm trying to think about how impractical this is.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.960
I try not to think about it, but I can't help it.

31:29.960 --> 31:31.960
Listen, it was basically built by gods, okay?

31:31.960 --> 31:33.960
They've got skills.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.960
Fair enough.

31:35.960 --> 31:38.960
I like some of the stats in Numenor, though, at least.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.960
Five sticks.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.960
The scrolls thing is starting to annoy me, too,

31:42.960 --> 31:46.960
because they've got ridiculously high-level architectural skills.

31:46.960 --> 31:48.960
But scrolls.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.960
Yeah, scrolls are a bit more primitive.

31:50.960 --> 31:53.960
I'm almost expecting them to have wax tablets.

31:53.960 --> 31:54.960
Oh, not the hardwoods.

31:54.960 --> 31:56.960
The stealthy cat-out hats.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.960
I'd rather have the black elf, actually.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.960
I love these things.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.960
They're like, how do we make it stealthy?

32:02.960 --> 32:04.960
We'll put, like, leaves on it.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.960
Nobody will ever see it moving.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.960
Are you going to leave a trail for the brandy books?

32:11.960 --> 32:14.960
Ah, yes, make the guy with the broken fucking legs pull the cart.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.960
Brilliant idea.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.960
Maybe I'll have eggs with him.

32:19.960 --> 32:20.960
Fuck it.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.960
This time, get animals.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.960
Get a horse, man.

32:24.960 --> 32:26.960
Oh, it's a giant.

32:26.960 --> 32:27.960
It's Sauron.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.960
He's going to help him drag the cart.

32:29.960 --> 32:30.960
Me and him.

32:30.960 --> 32:31.960
Blueron.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.960
Like, use him as slave labor.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.960
Maybe more.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.960
He's actually kind of cute and, like, lost puppy kind of way.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.960
Fucking lost giant puppy.

32:42.960 --> 32:45.960
He's the only character of interest in this arc, in my opinion.

32:45.960 --> 32:46.960
Yeah.

32:46.960 --> 32:49.960
They all are suspiciously white, aren't they?

32:49.960 --> 32:51.960
And they're wearing white, too.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.960
Oh, shit.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.960
They would explain why they hate sunlight because they've got no melanin.

32:57.960 --> 32:58.960
Mm.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.960
They're sizzling.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.960
It burns very conveniently now.

33:07.960 --> 33:08.960
Not earlier, though.

33:08.960 --> 33:12.960
Have you considered using bows, maybe?

33:12.960 --> 33:13.960
Oh.

33:13.960 --> 33:14.960
No throwing weapons.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.960
I mean, that works, too.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.960
Ah, good old-fashioned tug-of-war.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.960
They're just tug-of-warring.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.960
Fucking exhilarating.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.960
Don't cut them down with your weapons or anything.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.960
Let's pull them, Dorothy.

33:33.960 --> 33:34.960
Was that easy?

33:34.960 --> 33:35.960
Oh, no!

33:35.960 --> 33:39.960
So, did orcs always burn from sunlight?

33:39.960 --> 33:40.960
Uh, yes.

33:40.960 --> 33:41.960
Okay.

33:41.960 --> 33:42.960
Except for the urakai.

33:42.960 --> 33:45.960
Because Saruman's urakai are special.

33:45.960 --> 33:46.960
Right.

33:46.960 --> 33:47.960
That's why they made a big deal about it.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.960
Wolfers.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.960
It's a barge, but it looks dumb.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.960
Oh, god, it does look dumb.

33:55.960 --> 33:57.960
It does look dumb, yes.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.960
What the fuck is wrong with that?

33:59.960 --> 34:01.960
What the fuck is with that thing?

34:01.960 --> 34:02.960
That's some-

34:02.960 --> 34:05.960
Is this a hog-bog?

34:05.960 --> 34:06.960
Bog-bog.

34:06.960 --> 34:07.960
Attack.

34:07.960 --> 34:08.960
Oh, Jesus.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.960
It's like a chihuahua.

34:10.960 --> 34:14.960
I do like how they just let her die, by the way.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.960
Oh, my god.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.960
They're so fucking incompetent.

34:18.960 --> 34:19.960
That's a killer.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.960
Oh, don't worry, black elf to the rescue.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.960
Oh, I saw Legolas do this once.

34:30.960 --> 34:31.960
Oh, my god.

34:31.960 --> 34:32.960
That face.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.960
That thing's face.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.960
Forget about the chain.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.960
Just stab his ass.

34:40.960 --> 34:41.960
Like so.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.960
You stabbed him with a branch.

34:43.960 --> 34:44.960
Oh, hey.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.960
Wouldn't it be cool if the other orcs had bows and arrows, too?

34:47.960 --> 34:49.960
I didn't expect that.

34:49.960 --> 34:55.960
Did they think there wouldn't just be guards up above the trenches?

34:58.960 --> 34:59.960
Now, why?

35:01.960 --> 35:03.960
Because he's the main character, Kyle.

35:03.960 --> 35:04.960
You can't just kill him.

35:04.960 --> 35:05.960
Fuck.

35:05.960 --> 35:07.960
Does it make sense for them not-

35:07.960 --> 35:10.960
I mean, they killed everybody else, but not him.

35:10.960 --> 35:11.960
Yes.

35:11.960 --> 35:14.960
And now we need a reveal of Idar here.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.960
And this is going to be Sauron.

35:16.960 --> 35:17.960
They're all just Sauron.

35:17.960 --> 35:18.960
No, no, no.

35:18.960 --> 35:19.960
This is a red herring.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.960
Like, this is too obvious.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.960
Yeah, Idar's like a sub-commander or something like that.

35:25.960 --> 35:26.960
Yeah.

35:27.960 --> 35:28.960
He's an elf.

35:29.960 --> 35:30.960
Yeah.

35:30.960 --> 35:31.960
He's a motherfucking elf.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.960
Yeah, there's the way he's Sauron.

35:34.960 --> 35:35.960
And there ends the episode.

35:35.960 --> 35:36.960
He's a fucking elf.

35:37.960 --> 35:38.960
Wow.

35:38.960 --> 35:39.960
Well, hold on.

35:39.960 --> 35:43.960
Didn't Sauron appear to the elves as a fellow elf, in fact?

35:43.960 --> 35:44.960
Kib, stop it, Kibs.

35:45.960 --> 35:46.960
Stop what?

35:46.960 --> 35:48.960
The preview of episode four.

35:48.960 --> 35:49.960
Okay.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.960
I stopped it just in time.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.960
Okay, so yeah, that was episode three.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.960
What did you all think?

35:55.960 --> 35:58.960
I mean, it was better than one and two.

35:58.960 --> 35:59.960
That's true.

35:59.960 --> 36:00.960
That actually happened.

36:00.960 --> 36:06.960
This is kind of the House of the Dragon problem as well, where you start in the middle of

36:06.960 --> 36:07.960
the goddamn story.

36:07.960 --> 36:10.960
Like, episode one and two was practically pointless.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.960
Very little was established other than introducing the characters, which could have been done

36:13.960 --> 36:14.960
in an hour.

36:14.960 --> 36:15.960
Easy.

36:15.960 --> 36:16.960
Yeah.

36:16.960 --> 36:18.960
Now, finally, the ball is rolling.

36:18.960 --> 36:21.960
And I mean, it's better because something is happening.

36:22.960 --> 36:23.960
That's true.

36:23.960 --> 36:24.960
Yes, I agree.

36:24.960 --> 36:25.960
I like what they're doing with Halbrand.

36:25.960 --> 36:29.960
He's the most interesting part of the show now, is Halbrand.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.960
You know what's happening here?

36:31.960 --> 36:34.960
You know what this show has turned into?

36:34.960 --> 36:39.960
It's turned into a $5 billion production of Find Wally, as we were like, this is Sauron.

36:39.960 --> 36:40.960
That's Sauron.

36:41.960 --> 36:42.960
Oh, wait.

36:43.960 --> 36:44.960
Sauron.

36:44.960 --> 36:49.960
What if the big twist by the end of the season is that all of these plotlines are happening

36:49.960 --> 36:53.960
at different time periods and they're all Sauron?

36:53.960 --> 36:55.960
That's what I was suggesting earlier.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.960
Like, I would not be surprised.

36:57.960 --> 37:02.960
Like, in one of the other ones, the Southland's already fallen and they don't know it yet.

37:02.960 --> 37:03.960
Yep.

37:03.960 --> 37:08.960
The thing is, like, I actually wouldn't mind that because if they managed to do it subtly,

37:08.960 --> 37:11.960
it can actually be a rather clever twist.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.960
Like, oh, look, these are all my machinations, right?

37:14.960 --> 37:15.960
You know?

37:15.960 --> 37:16.960
I am Sauron.

37:16.960 --> 37:17.960
I've done all of this.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.960
But are they that clever, though?

37:20.960 --> 37:21.960
No.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.960
Well, I guess we will see.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.960
We didn't get any Elrond this time.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.960
No elrond, no dwarves.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.960
Honestly, this is probably for the best.

37:30.960 --> 37:35.960
The other episodes having all of the story arcs intermixed was a disaster in my opinion.

37:35.960 --> 37:39.960
Because it was just, and then then and then and then, and just like, and this group, and

37:39.960 --> 37:41.960
then now this group is doing something.

37:41.960 --> 37:46.960
Stuff actually happens when we actually focus an episode on only a couple arcs at a time.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.960
It needed more focus, certainly.

37:49.960 --> 37:54.960
So if the show slows itself down and gives like, okay, this episode is dedicated to these

37:54.960 --> 37:58.960
two groups of characters rather than jumping around all the time.

37:58.960 --> 38:03.960
The Hogwarts are still an incredibly unnecessary element.

38:03.960 --> 38:07.960
Yeah, the only interesting thing the Harfoots have going isn't the Harfoots.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.960
It's the it's the dude, the big dude, tall dude.

38:10.960 --> 38:11.960
It's Blueron.

38:11.960 --> 38:17.960
It's just here's the thing, though, of the last time we did this, the most interesting

38:17.960 --> 38:22.960
part of of that first video that we did was was Durin.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.960
So it's kind of sad to see him again.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.960
He'll get his own episode.

38:26.960 --> 38:31.960
Again, if they're going to slow it down and focus, then maybe we'll get more do it in

38:31.960 --> 38:37.960
the next episode, because this this was Black Elf, Harfoots and Galadriel's arcs.

38:37.960 --> 38:39.960
And nothing really happened with the Black Elf.

38:39.960 --> 38:43.960
Like, OK, he's a slave and they had like a failed revolt to go.

38:43.960 --> 38:48.960
See, the problem with the story line is it seems.

38:48.960 --> 38:49.960
Yeah, right at the end.

38:49.960 --> 38:50.960
Yeah, right at the end.

38:50.960 --> 38:51.960
They just kind of hint it.

38:51.960 --> 38:52.960
Yeah.

38:52.960 --> 38:56.960
The Black Elf storyline hasn't done anything.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.960
It's still at the exact same spot.

38:59.960 --> 39:04.960
Like, what reason do we have to give a shit about his adventures?

39:04.960 --> 39:07.960
It shows the fate of the Southlands, what it's going to do.

39:07.960 --> 39:08.960
That's my my theory.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.960
And it's going to also show us Adar, whoever this guy is.

39:11.960 --> 39:15.960
Well, that's true, I guess because Galadriel is talking about the Southlands.

39:15.960 --> 39:16.960
Oh, that's what it is.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.960
It's actually going to be Mordor in the future.

39:18.960 --> 39:21.960
And his story arc takes place there.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.960
So it's going to be more about the location, less about him.

39:24.960 --> 39:25.960
That's the thing, though.

39:25.960 --> 39:30.960
One of the brilliant things about Lord of the Rings was that it told you a lot of things

39:30.960 --> 39:32.960
without explaining them in detail.

39:32.960 --> 39:34.960
It made them mysterious.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.960
Like they were talking about, you know, dark things.

39:37.960 --> 39:41.960
I don't know if we need to see the Southlands form.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.960
Because otherwise it's not going to be Mordor.

39:43.960 --> 39:48.960
Yeah, but wouldn't it be more interesting if the people of the Southlands just went quiet or something?

39:48.960 --> 39:52.960
Instead of having this where it's a Black Elf going like,

39:52.960 --> 39:53.960
Well, I'm here.

39:53.960 --> 39:57.960
Entire garrisons of elves overrun instantly off screen.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.960
Where they just like, they close the gates and then like all communication stops.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.960
And then some of the fuck happened over there.

40:03.960 --> 40:04.960
It's like a mystery.

40:04.960 --> 40:09.960
But the issue is that I am not a fan of the elf garrison because that was the problem.

40:09.960 --> 40:13.960
How the hell do you have this band of randos overtaking elf garrison?

40:13.960 --> 40:14.960
Well, you don't.

40:14.960 --> 40:16.960
So you just don't.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.960
We just don't show it.

40:18.960 --> 40:25.960
But the problem is, is we should, in my opinion, story wise, we should see the Southlands fall and learn a little bit of how it falls.

40:25.960 --> 40:30.960
But the execution is so bad that we're better off not seeing it because they did it so poorly.

40:30.960 --> 40:35.960
Well, Kibbs, the execution is so bad we're better off not watching the show.

40:35.960 --> 40:36.960
That's true.

40:36.960 --> 40:39.960
Not seeing any of it at all.

40:39.960 --> 40:42.960
Yeah, I don't know what else I have to say about it.

40:42.960 --> 40:47.960
The first two episodes we could nitpick to shit because there was so much wrong with it.

40:47.960 --> 40:51.960
But this one, it's like, oh, it's turned into like competent TV.

40:51.960 --> 40:54.960
And it being competent means it's like, oh, well, it's there.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.960
It's committing the cardinal sin.

40:56.960 --> 40:57.960
It's no longer so bad.

40:57.960 --> 40:58.960
It's good.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.960
It's now it's just mediocre.

41:00.960 --> 41:03.960
The issue is this is after two hours.

41:03.960 --> 41:10.960
Like we are three hours into a TV show now and we have just finally been introduced to the scenario.

41:10.960 --> 41:16.960
When it comes to the Lord of the Rings extended edition, that's like 12 hours of stuff you can watch.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.960
At the three hour mark.

41:18.960 --> 41:19.960
At the three hour mark.

41:19.960 --> 41:20.960
Where are you?

41:20.960 --> 41:23.960
You're basically at the part where they are.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.960
They're they're exiting Moria.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.960
Yes, that's what I thought to be.

41:27.960 --> 41:31.960
It'd be around the exiting Moria and getting into Galadriel's realm.

41:31.960 --> 41:35.960
A shit ton has happened at that point in the story.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.960
Yep, there's you could talk about it for hours.

41:37.960 --> 41:44.960
Honestly, all the stuff that happened, all the nuances of what happened in Moria, all Frodo and them and the forming of the fellowship.

41:45.960 --> 41:51.960
In this show, at the three hour mark, we've basically just left the Shire.

41:51.960 --> 41:55.960
Yeah, this slow pacing hasn't benefited the show.

41:55.960 --> 42:02.960
Like, I care no more about Black Elf now than I did three hours previously.

42:02.960 --> 42:04.960
Yeah, honestly, we could cut out.

42:04.960 --> 42:12.960
Honestly, episode one, A Shadow of the Past and episode two, Adrift, cut those two out and then skip to three.

42:12.960 --> 42:15.960
There's so little.

42:15.960 --> 42:20.960
Skip to three, slap on 10, 20 minutes of exposition.

42:20.960 --> 42:23.960
Like, have the elves, you know, they're having a happy day.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.960
You know, they're just doing their shit.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.960
Then the orcs sneak in, ambush them, drag them away.

42:28.960 --> 42:30.960
I mean, skip the boat entirely.

42:30.960 --> 42:33.960
Just have her be on Numenor.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.960
On Numenor?

42:35.960 --> 42:37.960
Yes, for some reason.

42:37.960 --> 42:39.960
Because the entire part of that is just dumb.

42:39.960 --> 42:44.960
Like, the swim home part is the stupidest thing I've seen in television in a long time.

42:44.960 --> 42:49.960
You just start swimming off into the horizon and you're like, oh, okay.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.960
That wasn't for plot armor.

42:51.960 --> 42:55.960
She'd just be dead, dead, dead, immediate, no survival.

42:55.960 --> 43:00.960
But then again, I mean, if Numenor is barred from the elves, how do you get her there?

43:00.960 --> 43:02.960
Oh, you have to get there by circumstance.

43:02.960 --> 43:03.960
How do you do that?

43:03.960 --> 43:04.960
Oh, with the shipwreck.

43:04.960 --> 43:05.960
How do you get her to her shipwreck?

43:05.960 --> 43:11.960
Well, the only time we know that the elves actually do any sort of sailing is when they're going off to their homeland.

43:11.960 --> 43:13.960
So we've got to get her on one of those boats.

43:13.960 --> 43:14.960
So how do we do that?

43:14.960 --> 43:16.960
Oh, we've got to honor her somehow.

43:16.960 --> 43:22.960
And then, like, you can follow their logic back, but it's all just contrived.

43:22.960 --> 43:28.960
And the problem too is, the Numenor storyline has been so ridiculously special.

43:28.960 --> 43:31.960
Like, the fall of Numenor is supposed to be the fall of Numenor.

43:31.960 --> 43:36.960
It's supposed to be the slow corruption of the people against the Valar and against the elves.

43:36.960 --> 43:46.960
But not only have we skipped that, we've gone past it to the point now that they have instituted an ethnostate that hates all non-Numenorians.

43:46.960 --> 43:55.960
I mean, we're not even talking about the lore inconsistencies now, because you could get started there and never stop.

43:55.960 --> 43:57.960
Don't be a racist, Arch.

43:57.960 --> 43:58.960
Yeah.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.960
This is just the story we're talking about here.

44:00.960 --> 44:02.960
Like, this could be done a lot better.

44:02.960 --> 44:14.960
And I feel like maybe they're resting on the idea that this is going to be a five-season thing and that this will be something epic and people won't mind the first two hours.

44:14.960 --> 44:23.960
But at the same time, if the Fellowship of the Rings was just two hours of Frodo fucking about in the Shire, would anyone watch it?

44:23.960 --> 44:26.960
I mean, I've watched that over this.

44:26.960 --> 44:30.960
But not very much.

44:30.960 --> 44:34.960
I'm guessing that they're trying to take, like, oh, we're in a TV show.

44:34.960 --> 44:38.960
Let's just take the extra time we have.

44:38.960 --> 44:42.960
But then they run into the risk of just boring people.

44:42.960 --> 44:49.960
I guess I would rather there be more than too much than too little.

44:49.960 --> 44:51.960
Are you sure about that, though?

44:51.960 --> 44:53.960
Because you can definitely get too much.

44:54.960 --> 44:59.960
Fair enough. I feel like we've been getting a bit much with the Harfoots.

44:59.960 --> 45:00.960
Yeah.

45:00.960 --> 45:03.960
Fucking Harfoots.

45:03.960 --> 45:06.960
I'm not going to go away. That's the worst part.

45:06.960 --> 45:07.960
Yeah.

45:07.960 --> 45:09.960
Like, the Harfoots are just unbelievably uninteresting.

45:09.960 --> 45:12.960
Like, they have no role in the story. They shouldn't be here.

45:12.960 --> 45:19.960
The only reason they're there is because the showrunners were so blinded by the established thing that had gone before it.

45:19.960 --> 45:25.960
They were like, we must have Harpets. We can't have Harpets. Harpets didn't exist. We must have Harpets.

45:25.960 --> 45:30.960
Oh, they need to detach themselves from the fact that they have to be like the Lord of the Rings movies.

45:30.960 --> 45:37.960
Because by doing that, they're shackling themselves to the idea that they're competing to be that thing that was so good.

45:37.960 --> 45:40.960
And so they're already setting themselves up for failure.

45:40.960 --> 45:45.960
Yet at the same time, though, they're not adopting any of the positive aspects of the movies.

45:45.960 --> 45:46.960
Goodness.

45:47.960 --> 45:49.960
Why does that thing exist?

45:49.960 --> 45:54.960
That thing is in the uncanny valley. It's not scary. It's a dumb look.

45:54.960 --> 45:59.960
That had some weird CG going on with it. Something wasn't right there.

45:59.960 --> 46:02.960
They'll spend some extra hours in the bakery.

46:02.960 --> 46:05.960
Yeah. I mean, I don't know what the heck they were thinking.

46:05.960 --> 46:12.960
The Vargs from the Lord of the Rings, like, the original trilogy, yeah, they're like hyenas crossed with, like, some sort of horse thing.

46:12.960 --> 46:15.960
But you know what? Whatever. It looks alright.

46:15.960 --> 46:21.960
These things, or that thing, I don't know what the heck that was. It did not look right. It looked a little derpy.

46:21.960 --> 46:23.960
Well, a pug barg.

46:23.960 --> 46:25.960
It did look like a pug barg.

46:25.960 --> 46:27.960
It had the balding eyes, too.

46:27.960 --> 46:29.960
Man, it did not look healthy.

46:29.960 --> 46:41.960
If you spend a billion dollars in the show, and you're gonna, you know, work a dozen VFX artists to death every single day to get it out, you gotta make it look better than that.

46:41.960 --> 46:45.960
But obviously they didn't work enough VFX artists to death, Dev.

46:45.960 --> 46:48.960
That's true. She's got a point.

46:48.960 --> 46:51.960
We gotta sacrifice more South Koreans.

46:51.960 --> 46:59.960
The city scenes themselves don't look half bad, but that Varg, oh, that was vain to look at.

46:59.960 --> 47:07.960
Alright, it's 2am, and I gotta edit this before going to bed, and Arch, you're probably ready to collapse, so...

47:07.960 --> 47:11.960
It's time, isn't it? It's time to wrap it up for today.

47:11.960 --> 47:14.960
Fun and games. Fun and games.

47:14.960 --> 47:18.960
So we'll be back again next week for more of this nonsense.

47:18.960 --> 47:20.960
Thanks for being here, guys.

47:20.960 --> 47:23.960
And thank you.

47:23.960 --> 47:28.960
I wish I could say it was a pleasure.

47:28.960 --> 47:34.960
But we're watching Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power, so...

47:34.960 --> 47:36.960
It is what it is.
