0	8600	So, it's been one week, and I don't know if you guys have noticed, but Amazon still hasn't
8600	11680	allowed anybody to put reviews up of this show.
11680	14520	In a very long 72 hours.
14520	19200	I've checked my review, and every time I check my review, it's like, oh, would you like to
19200	20200	publish this?
20200	21200	I'm like, yes, publish.
21200	23240	I'm like, okay, we're publishing it.
23240	24240	Refresh page.
24240	27480	Would you like to publish this?
27480	29560	Maybe reviews are having an effect.
29560	30560	Amazon is scared.
30560	35960	Like, they wouldn't do this if they wouldn't, because you gotta understand how bad this
35960	37660	looks for the normies.
37660	38660	Like hold on.
38660	39660	Why can't I review this?
39660	41360	Why are they holding reviews for 72 hours?
41360	42860	It's been 72 hours.
42860	44740	Why aren't there any reviews?
44740	47640	Like the normies may be sheep, but they're not idiots.
47640	48640	Yep.
48640	49640	It's a big red flag.
49640	55540	Well, do you guys think this will be like the Amy Schumer special where eventually Amazon
55540	60260	just takes out the ability to review because of this?
60260	61260	Like entirely?
61260	62260	Like in perpetuity?
62260	63260	Yeah.
63260	66040	Oh jeez, that'd be funny.
66040	71800	It might be, because it would avoid further headaches, but like it's already too late.
71800	78860	The Rings of Power is a joke, and it is going to be held up as an example of like bad corporate
78860	81060	production for a decade to come.
81060	82300	Wait, what's all that clicking?
82300	84660	Is it, are you like fidget spinning arch or something?
84660	89620	I'm trying to hold it as far away from the microphone as I can, but I've got one of those
89620	93140	grip trainers that I'm using to keep myself awake right now.
93140	94140	Oh, that's right.
94140	95820	We're doing this at 6 AM year time.
95820	96820	Jesus.
96820	98260	Oh my God, hang in there blondie.
98260	100740	Somebody send that man a Coke.
100740	106460	I have had two, but at this point I just need to do something and the grip trainer exhausts
106460	108580	me enough to keep me awake.
108580	110000	Jesus.
110000	116960	So on the, the, the prime video site for Canada, it does show at the very least the IMDB score,
116960	117960	which is 6.7% currently.
117960	118960	Yep.
118960	120960	It shows the same for US.
120960	121960	Yeah.
121960	122960	All right.
122960	125160	And that is off the massive censorship.
125160	126160	Yes.
126160	127160	Jesus.
127160	128160	That's, that's a pretty big oof.
128160	129160	There's still person abuse by the way.
129160	130160	Yeah.
130160	131160	I'm not surprised.
131160	132160	Arch, you and I both talked about hate watching.
132160	136240	I mean, it turns out that putting out reviews does in fact have an effect.
136240	137600	I think we were both correct on that.
137600	138600	Yeah.
138600	139600	Like obviously.
140200	143800	You gotta remember the normies, their only real frame of reference is the reviews.
143800	145100	Like they don't watch us.
145100	147040	They don't even watch the mainstream media.
147040	151580	They look at IMDB, they look at Rotten Tomatoes and okay, is this show good?
151580	155040	And those that do look at reviews, notice that the market's been cornered because Amazon
155040	156400	has removed the reviewing system.
156400	159640	Well, now our reviews are even getting more hits than they otherwise would.
159640	160640	Yep.
160640	161640	And then they'll get suspicious.
161640	164240	Like, hold on, why aren't there any reviews for this show?
164240	168120	And then they might actually go to Google and go like rings of power reviews.
168120	170020	And then the shit will pop up.
170020	171600	Thank you algorithm.
171600	177160	And speaking of actually watching it on Prime Video, I got raked over the coals last week
177160	180960	for because of the fact that like we streamed it from Prime Video.
180960	183980	Listen, I'm going to sell Kibs up the river right now.
183980	184980	It wasn't me.
184980	187040	Kibs is the one presenting this feed to you guys.
187040	188400	I wouldn't watch this on Amazon.
188400	190400	I would pirate this if I was going to do it.
190400	191840	You can definitely blame me for it.
191840	192840	No big deal.
192840	196600	Like I use Amazon because I live out in the middle of Minnesota in the middle of nowhere,
196600	197600	right?
198080	199200	I saw a burn down.
199200	201680	I'm not going to.
201680	205080	So a few things have happened before we start, we'll just I just want to give you a couple
205080	206880	of a little bit more context, okay?
206880	211560	So in the week, the week since since we've all, you know, convened, and the end of reviews
211560	216040	haven't been been allowed to be posted, we've started to see stuff like this, for example,
216040	218120	Amazon's the rings of powers.
218120	226720	The rings of powers is what the is what the article says, is not for purists or racists.
226720	233600	And this article, yes, they're conflating people who care about Tolkien's lore and sticking
233600	235700	to the story with racism.
235700	239860	You might not like it if you're a purist or a racist.
239860	241620	That's how you know a show's good.
241620	246920	Like they have to fall behind that and just accuse anybody who might criticize it.
246920	251680	Well, you just don't like my show because you're fucking racist.
251680	255140	And hey, I admit, I do not like the diversity.
255140	260340	And so far, the diversity has been the only real genuine sign of wokeism.
260340	264820	But the thing is, I don't dislike the diversity, because they're brown.
264820	268720	I dislike the diversity because there's a fantasy setting where they don't exist.
268720	270420	And here's the thing too.
270420	275020	Nothing is stopping them from making a story with a diverse cast.
275020	279460	Like we mentioned the last time they have a village in the Southlands, like in an area
279460	282740	that should be on the border of Rhun or Kandar.
282740	286940	These people should be brown, and yet they are white.
286940	291660	To your villages normally will, but you see, carrying about lower is a sign of racism,
291660	292660	apparently.
292660	294460	Yeah, we don't want that.
294460	296140	So it's got to be an ethnostate village.
296140	300980	See, I had this talk about the light tier movie and the lesbian kids, because a lot
300980	302780	of people are up in arms about that.
302780	306100	And I looked, I was like, this is nothing like it's a loving family.
306100	307180	It's a quick peck on the lips.
307180	308180	This is not a problem.
308180	309180	Yeah.
309180	315780	I don't remember who put it in there, and suddenly it's not just a loving family and
315780	316780	a peck on the lips.
316780	318420	It is the agenda.
318420	319980	There's a reason why it's there.
319980	321820	I still think that wasn't a big deal, to be honest.
321820	322820	It's just whatever.
322820	323980	They didn't do anything with it.
323980	324980	It's okay for me.
324980	326820	It doesn't bother me in the slightest.
326820	329620	I just dislike the underhanded nature.
329620	333220	If they just have it in there and it's like, oh, it's just a thing that happens in the
333220	334220	story.
334220	335220	Not a big deal.
335220	339440	They're only depicting female on female lesbian relationships.
339440	342720	We need full on male, male gay sex.
342720	343840	That's that's what you know.
343840	345340	They're truly brave.
345340	347260	And they got to play it in Saudi Arabia.
347260	348260	Yes.
348260	350260	No, zero censorship.
350260	359120	Well, in the face of all of this racism and all of these racist negative reviews, we had
359120	364860	the official Twitter account of the show post, we stand in solidarity with our cast.
365540	370740	They're doing the same thing that was done in regards to Moses Ingram for the Kenobi
370740	375260	show and every show right now that's getting blasted for being just a terrible piece of
375260	376260	shit.
376260	378260	This always ends up happening, right?
378260	381300	The official Twitter account comes out, posts a big, long diatribe.
381300	385580	Everyone's cheering it on and going, yes, Queen Slakes, it's fucking Twitter and it's
385580	386740	a garbage pile.
386740	389540	You can almost predict these things.
389540	393120	It's like you're in the Matrix and you can just see all of it instead of the code.
393120	396120	You can see exactly what they're going to do exactly what they're going to say before
396120	397120	it even happens.
397120	402400	Well, you can see anybody can see it from a while away is this like it's the go to for
402400	405960	any big corporate project, especially Disneyland.
405960	410920	In relation to all of this, did you guys see the new Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power
410920	411920	merch?
411920	412920	No, I haven't.
412920	417660	Amazon got together the four original actors for the hobbits, the four hobbits, and they're
417660	424500	peddling these hats and T-shirts that say in Elvish, you are all welcome here.
424500	429540	And then it shows a bunch of different ears, human ears and elf ears of all different colors.
429540	433700	That's the dumbest and boringest thing I think I've ever heard from merch.
433700	437820	It's the cringiest fucking thing I've seen in a while.
437820	444220	Like, not like cool little figurines or soldiers or action characters or maybe like a cool
444220	447020	comic or something that looks atrocious.
447020	450900	That looks so sad.
450900	455780	So if you want to support Rings of Power, you got to buy this T-shirt or else you're
455780	457020	one of the racists.
457020	460580	They also look so old and sad.
460580	463660	Like they don't look like they won't even be there.
463660	465660	It doesn't even jump out and scream.
465660	467100	This is Lord of the Rings.
467100	470260	Come on, Kibs, thirty nine ninety nine.
470260	475060	Show your fucking nine ninety nine for that.
475060	482820	Are you shitting me for a shitty shirt that has some sort of stains on it?
482820	489820	I also need to point out that just like the Riva thing, Ismael Cruz, the black elf, also
489820	495900	had on day one on launch the announcement that he was receiving racist hatred.
495900	501460	Yeah, in fact, I remember that because I said this again in my Kenobi video where Disney
501460	506900	basically told Moses Ingram, you're going to get racist shit for this.
506900	511160	And we're kind of counting on it because that becomes a really good headline.
511160	516220	Please tell us as soon as you get anything, man, we really are at the point where it's
516220	522700	like in order to help the grand political project, you must watch the worst fucking
522700	525180	dog shit TV imaginable.
525180	529700	And if nothing else, it will send yet another loud and clear message to Amazon, because
529700	533500	also the various companies have been turning again.
533500	538380	I keep saying you can't give up just because it didn't happen instantly, that all of these
538380	540460	companies went unwoke instantly.
540460	544920	It takes months and years for them to do anything.
544920	546860	And at the end of the day, it's very simple.
546860	551780	Reward good stuff, punish bad stuff, and sooner or later, the message will shine through.
551780	556260	Well, I think it's time for this episode to shine through you guys.
556260	557260	You guys ready?
557260	558260	No.
558260	559260	Nope.
559820	568300	Lord of the Rings, Rings of Power, season one, episode three, Adar, Adar, Adar, I think
568300	572260	this might be the corrupted elf we heard about.
572260	573260	Let's roll.
573260	575140	All right.
575140	581180	So I keep hearing that this guy might not be Sauron, but Gandalf, Mauler was telling
581180	582180	me that.
583100	590060	If it is, that would be an even bigger lore break than it being Sauron, because Gandalf
590060	594020	is alive right now, like he's in the other land to the west.
594020	595020	He's a person.
595020	598940	Like he went to Middle Earth on a mission, along with the other wizards.
598940	601100	He didn't just fucking dump there one day.
601100	607140	Yeah, it could be, see, I could see it being a red herring because it's too obvious, but
607140	614340	it's one of the things where like, okay, then who is?
614340	615340	Maybe they just killed them.
615340	616780	Maybe we'll never see him again.
616780	617780	Wouldn't that be lovely?
617780	618780	That would be nice.
618780	621860	You want me to skip the intro, by the way, I can if you want.
621860	626780	Dev likes the intro, doesn't he?
626780	631240	This is something else that shows do these days where they're like, they make things
631240	636720	like this to be epic because they somehow believe that they deserve it.
636720	641460	They haven't achieved anything yet, and it's like, oh my God, look at this.
641460	645560	It was also popularized by Game of Thrones with that, honestly, really good opening intro
645560	649200	with all of the clockwork machinations and shit, and now everyone does it.
649200	650200	Yeah.
650200	654360	Well, to be fair, House of the Dragon's doing a kind of decent one, but it's like flowing
654360	655360	wax or something.
655360	656360	I think it's blood.
656360	657360	What, I'd imagine.
657360	658360	You think it's blood?
658360	659360	Yeah.
659360	664360	Well, the entire idea of the Targaryens is that, you know, their blood is special.
664360	665360	Yeah, I guess.
665360	667860	But of the Targaryens' fluid.
667860	674480	The orcs have elected to not kill their arch enemy, the elf, for some reason.
674480	677220	That's because they're actually misunderstood, okay?
677220	684440	Here we have the Ku Klux Klan orcs in their hoods.
684440	688520	Yeah, why are they all wearing hoods?
688520	695560	Because it makes them look more KKK-ish.
695560	696560	What's the entire garrison?
696560	697560	Oh my God.
697560	698560	What the fuck happened?
698560	699560	What the fuck?
699560	700560	They're still in Navjd.
700560	701560	What the fuck?
701560	702560	They suck.
702560	706600	So we let them dance for us alive.
706600	707900	You guys were soldiers.
707900	710400	You had weapons in the tower.
710400	715320	What happened, and why didn't we see that?
715320	718680	Alright, well, now we know why she didn't run to the garrison, because the garrison
718680	721680	was already run by elf-time orcs.
721680	724040	From before this guy saw her own.
724040	725920	Is it Black Queen time?
725920	727920	I didn't know the new middle-eastern universe.
727920	734680	Well, you know, it's the modern day.
734680	737880	My dagger.
737880	739560	My ice-climbing pick.
739560	743760	Oh, time for some more grand CGI, I think.
743760	749240	So is it just me, or does she only have one facial expression this entire show?
749240	751240	Constantly petulant, yes.
751240	754360	It's like women aren't allowed to express themselves anymore.
754360	755360	Slightly constipated.
755360	756360	Slightly constipated.
756360	759360	And here's the thing, you can do that kind of a character.
759360	765280	You can do, like, the female hero from Kill La Kill or something, but it doesn't work
765280	766280	with Galadriel.
766280	767280	That's kind of the point.
767280	769280	She has a character, yeah.
769280	778720	Other than, like, Ryoko from Kill La Kill, her emotion was at least vivid, anger, just
778720	784960	anger, whereas she's just kind of mildly annoyed at everything around her.
784960	787040	Again, it's a strong female character.
787040	790760	The chick from House of the Dragon's the same, frumpy.
790760	793740	That seems to be the emotion of strong female character.
793740	795000	Like Rey, too.
795000	796000	Constantly petulant.
796000	799000	Look, she has to deal with men, okay?
800000	801000	That's enough.
801000	804000	We should tell Galadriel to smile more.
804000	805000	Oof.
805000	806000	Cancelled.
806000	810000	In the Great Wall, your ancestors stood with Morgoth.
810000	812000	How the fuck do you know his ancestry?
812000	813000	Do you smell it on him?
813000	815000	As a reward, the Valar granted on this island.
815000	817880	Hold on, I'm noticing this now.
817880	821120	She's rolling every single R when it's a foreign word.
821120	823820	It feels like, this is going to be a Canadian joke, it feels like she's rolling up the rim
823820	824820	to win.
824820	830820	So Sauron is already here, because he's turning them against the elves.
830820	835940	I think as time drifted, I don't remember, but I believe the Numenoreans did drift apart
835940	836940	from the elves.
836940	840820	Yeah, but a lot of that was specifically Sauron.
840820	847500	Because Sauron comes into play off the whole thing about like, oh, Valar, they're denying
847500	849660	you, the immortality.
849660	856880	Well, some people are saying that this guy is Sauron.
856880	862020	This guy, I could see it, it would be really cringe, but I could see it.
862020	865400	And they're going to do like a Galadriel-Sauron romance.
865400	866980	Oh, stop.
866980	868620	Where she gets betrayed.
868620	871100	I don't think they would do that.
871100	872960	The worst part is I can see it.
872960	874960	I don't want to.
874960	877960	It could be bad if he did.
877960	880960	You're near the fuck.
880960	881960	Ew.
881960	882960	Gross.
882960	883960	Untermich.
883960	888960	Wait, he was checking her out.
888960	889960	Sure.
889960	893960	I mean, she's still wearing the bathrobe they found her in.
893960	895960	Oh my god.
895960	898960	Ah, yes, the Black Queen of the Numenoreans.
898960	900960	Smelt nasty in there.
900960	903960	Another one was black.
904960	906960	Every R, man.
911960	914960	Yes, she does it all every goddamn R.
916960	917960	He's Sauron.
917960	919960	Look at how charismatic he is.
919960	921960	We can't have a competent male.
921960	925960	I am still not sure that the show isn't going to do a Witcher thing and turn out that there's
925960	927960	like five fucking Saurons.
927960	931960	Well, I'm going to go to bed then.
931960	932960	He does have to be evil.
932960	934960	He's going to be evil, yeah.
934960	936960	For longer than you know.
936960	940960	He is raising some flags, it's true.
943960	947960	Sounds like I want to get a little bit, you know, just a little something before I become
947960	949960	a Dark Lord.
952960	955960	Is he someone we should know?
955960	957960	That's Isildur.
957960	960960	The guy we're just seeing there in that scene a second ago.
960960	961960	Yep.
961960	963960	Elendil's son is Isildur.
963960	967960	Right, the guy who ends up with the one ring in the intro of Fellowship.
967960	969960	Yep, correct.
969960	973960	It's a time for Isildur to celebrate his bravery.
973960	976960	Prove you're not just a nepotism hire.
977960	980960	Those sales are very stupid, I just want to point that out.
980960	984960	Sometimes the cinematography makes me think this might be a good show.
984960	988960	And then I am reminded by what we're watching.
988960	990960	The sea is always right.
990960	992960	The sea is a cairn.
994960	996960	There you are.
996960	997960	Jesus.
997960	1000960	Those are some Shapiro milkers.
1002960	1003960	Wait, hold on.
1003960	1008960	Are they persecuting him based on his last name?
1008960	1009960	Yep.
1009960	1012960	So in the lore, didn't Numenor sink into the ocean?
1012960	1013960	Yes.
1013960	1015960	They broke a man.
1016960	1019960	Yeah, it's basically just like...
1021960	1022960	Atlantis.
1022960	1024960	Yes, that's what I was thinking of. Atlantis.
1024960	1028960	And then the Numenoreans became the kings of Gondor.
1032960	1036960	Are all of the orcs just pale white now?
1039960	1041960	Yeah, they were black skinned before, weren't they?
1041960	1042960	Yeah.
1042960	1047960	Not necessarily uniformly black, but they certainly weren't that white.
1052960	1056960	Very educated orcs, too. Very smooth-spoken.
1056960	1059960	I recently watched all three of the original movies with Naomi,
1059960	1065960	and they basically seemed like anarchists that Sauron whipped into shape, but only temporarily.
1065960	1070960	I mean, they're intended to be wild and animalistic, brutish.
1070960	1071960	Gonna get it.
1078960	1079960	Oh, Jesus.
1080960	1081960	Okay.
1081960	1083960	I mean, one of them was gonna die, you could tell.
1083960	1084960	Yeah.
1085960	1088960	Also, that is not bleeding much for a fucking neck wood.
1088960	1089960	I mean, he's not dead, dude.
1089960	1091960	What the fuck? He's not dead.
1091960	1092960	Nope, he's dead.
1092960	1093960	He's barely bleeding.
1093960	1094960	He's fine.
1094960	1095960	I mean, he's dead.
1095960	1097960	I've had worse shaving accidents.
1098960	1103960	Listen, elves only have a little bit of blood in them, alright?
1105960	1106960	Apparently.
1106960	1107960	He's not dead.
1107960	1108960	No, don't leave him.
1108960	1109960	He's not...
1109960	1110960	Never fucking mind.
1110960	1111960	He's dead now.
1111960	1112960	He's dead.
1112960	1113960	Dad shows us he's dead.
1114960	1115960	Okay.
1115960	1116960	Very well, TV show.
1117960	1118960	That is a very stupid axe.
1118960	1121960	And also, it's like, okay, great job.
1121960	1124960	Now you have less people to cut down on trees.
1125960	1129960	Could Amazon not afford the ketchup?
1130960	1132960	They're gonna be there a while, dude.
1132960	1133960	Takes a lot to cut down on trees.
1133960	1134960	Yeah.
1135960	1137960	At least the orcs don't like being in the sun.
1137960	1139960	Except for the fact that they were standing in the sun.
1139960	1141960	Except for when they do, yes.
1142960	1145960	See, I was gonna compliment them on that touch.
1145960	1146960	I was like, oh, you know that.
1146960	1147960	And then they do that.
1149960	1151960	As they're all standing in the sun, like, yeah, it's whatever.
1152960	1153960	Show.
1153960	1154960	Yeah.
1154960	1155960	Hide your ears.
1155960	1157960	It's the only identifiable feature of an elf.
1157960	1160960	At least in this universe, where they're just humans.
1160960	1165960	Yeah, I guess if you were an elf on a stealth mission, and it were, you know, not this show,
1165960	1167960	you'd just be glowing down the hallway.
1167960	1168960	It's like, oops.
1171960	1173960	Fucking bloodthirsty.
1173960	1174960	Yeah.
1174960	1175960	Jesus.
1175960	1178960	Immediate jumps, I'm gonna fucking kill you.
1184960	1186960	I guess she likes riding horses.
1186960	1187960	Caleb.
1187960	1190960	Also, I wanna point out something as well here.
1190960	1195960	Uh, Elendil was called Elendil the Tall as one of his names because he was like two and
1195960	1197960	a half meters.
1199960	1202960	Well, maybe they couldn't quite do that.
1203960	1207960	I mean, they can't make the hobbits look small, so I guess it would be difficult to make him
1207960	1208960	look tall.
1208960	1212960	Quit pointing out these things, Arch, okay?
1212960	1214960	Well, who the fuck are you gonna get to play him?
1214960	1215960	Yao Ming?
1215960	1216960	Yes.
1216960	1220960	Well, the thing is, in the Lord of the Rings movies, they managed to use tricks to make
1220960	1223960	the characters look taller or smaller.
1223960	1226960	Oh god, is that Galadriel's smile?
1226960	1227960	Please, go back.
1227960	1228960	Yes.
1228960	1230960	Go back to, go back to being grumpy.
1230960	1232960	We need to not know what we asked for.
1232960	1233960	No, what the fuck?
1233960	1234960	Stop.
1235960	1237960	Actually, that's kinda great.
1237960	1239960	Like, she looks like a fucking shark smile.
1239960	1241960	I bet it looks sadistic and evil.
1242960	1245960	It's better than just having her perma-skull for the entire show.
1245960	1247960	Yeah, I guess maybe.
1247960	1248960	I don't know.
1249960	1250960	Where did he get money from?
1250960	1252960	He probably pick-pocketed it.
1252960	1254960	He's stealing from everyone.
1255960	1257960	Did your guild seal?
1258960	1259960	No, no, the seal.
1261960	1262960	He doesn't give a fuck.
1262960	1263960	That's funny.
1263960	1264960	Oh, they're mad.
1265960	1267960	He's too charismatic!
1268960	1270960	You know what?
1270960	1275960	I will say he's at least, like, interesting in a way that the first two episodes weren't.
1275960	1278960	Yep, and there goes the Guild of Crests.
1278960	1280960	He just, he's sniping it.
1280960	1281960	Yep.
1281960	1282960	He's got it.
1282960	1286960	I mean, he's the, he's, yeah, no, he's better than Disa.
1286960	1290960	He's the most interesting character so far, just because I can't tell if he's just a lovable
1290960	1292960	rogue or something.
1292960	1295960	He's too, he's too good.
1295960	1300960	I'm hoping he's just a lovable rogue, because it just would be more interesting.
1300960	1302960	Oh, they noticed.
1303960	1304960	Darn.
1306960	1310960	I mean, your captain didn't notice lifting a fucking dagger off him, so.
1315960	1318960	Because apparently he's ridiculously good at fighting.
1320960	1321960	Charismatic.
1321960	1322960	Very.
1322960	1323960	Oh!
1323960	1324960	Nice.
1324960	1326960	Ridiculously strong.
1326960	1327960	Fucking rude.
1327960	1330960	I think he is strong.
1330960	1333960	I mean, that's not human strength.
1333960	1336960	That was, that was the entire fucking arm bone there.
1336960	1337960	That was quick.
1337960	1338960	Self-defense.
1338960	1341960	At least, at least the police force is good.
1341960	1343960	Quick response time.
1343960	1346960	There's no Second Amendment on Numenor, though.
1346960	1347960	True.
1347960	1348960	There's a lot of scrolls.
1348960	1350960	You'd think they'd have books by now.
1351960	1354960	Yeah, but scrolls are more fancy and old-timey.
1354960	1356960	Yeah, I guess so.
1356960	1358960	Oh, there's a book.
1358960	1360960	There's a few books.
1360960	1367960	Well, they combine books and scrolls for the worst possible keep-a-jib knowledge.
1367960	1368960	Good.
1368960	1373960	They haven't made, they haven't made the transition fully over yet.
1373960	1376960	They got one guy copying it and used it really slowly.
1376960	1379960	Yeah, the Numenor story has been...
1379960	1382960	...accelerated.
1382960	1384960	I don't mind it.
1384960	1386960	Stuff's actually happening.
1386960	1388960	Better than the Harvards.
1388960	1389960	Wait.
1389960	1392960	I'm confused as to where the Southlands is.
1392960	1394960	Is the Southlands Mordor?
1394960	1395960	Yes.
1395960	1396960	That's what it looks like.
1396960	1398960	Yeah, it kind of does.
1398960	1400960	Why'd you write that down?
1401960	1402960	Ah.
1402960	1403960	Yes.
1404960	1407960	Sauron was like, hmm, my god might lose.
1407960	1410960	I should make a contingency plan.
1410960	1412960	Hands out the world map.
1412960	1413960	Yep.
1413960	1419960	Well, we already know that he succeeds because the Southlands become Mordor.
1419960	1422960	Well, yeah, that's kind of the problem.
1422960	1426960	And in that case, it is on the border of goddamn Run and Kandahan, etc.
1426960	1427960	Like, Kandahar.
1427960	1428960	Khan.
1428960	1429960	Khan?
1429960	1430960	Kar.
1430960	1431960	What's the name of the Eastern Kingdom?
1431960	1438960	Wasn't after the war, though, didn't a bunch of people settle there from different regions that fought alongside the elves?
1438960	1440960	Or no?
1440960	1442960	Not that far, I think.
1442960	1445960	Like, that's well beyond the original borders of Gondor.
1445960	1450960	No, Gondor actually occasionally occupied a fair portion of Mordor.
1450960	1453960	Yeah, but remember the Black Gate was their fortress.
1453960	1455960	I don't think they'd be that deep.
1455960	1458960	Wait, why do the hobbits have pterodactyl suits?
1458960	1460960	Why do they look like African tribals?
1460960	1464960	Because, Dev, it's their cultural heritage.
1468960	1470960	Oh, they even do the dancy thing.
1470960	1471960	Yep.
1486960	1487960	Imagine doing this for hours.
1487960	1488960	Yeah.
1488960	1492960	Like, it looks like it's supposed to be a celebration, but you have two lines.
1492960	1494960	Like, at that point, it just sounds like indoctrination.
1494960	1497960	Well, or an activist chant.
1497960	1500960	Whose streets are streets?
1500960	1502960	You have carts.
1502960	1504960	Like, why is his ankle a problem?
1504960	1508960	This society isn't very intelligent.
1508960	1516960	The hobbit's gonna be like, okay, if you can't walk, we're not gonna carry you, we're not gonna put you in a stretcher or in a wagon, we're gonna leave your ass.
1516960	1521960	Also, please push, take the goddamn nuts out of your hair, Jesus Christ, why?
1521960	1527960	Oh, now, see, I've been at that point for a while where I see their hair and I'm like, that's just stupid.
1527960	1528960	What if...
1528960	1533960	Look, it's all camouflage, it makes sense in the lore, I think.
1533960	1539960	No, no, wait, what if they actually grow in their heads?
1539960	1544960	Because they're forest spirits, so they have, like, branches growing out of their skulls.
1544960	1546960	I hate their hair so much.
1546960	1548960	She's independent.
1548960	1553960	Actually, okay, from the back, you can kind of see the fake plastic stems.
1553960	1561960	I was almost enjoying myself there for a moment, but now, we're back here.
1561960	1563960	How many independent female characters, Barge?
1563960	1565960	You got a problem, Dan?
1565960	1567960	Just annoying.
1567960	1569960	There.
1569960	1572960	What is she wearing?
1572960	1576960	I don't know, whatever shit she rolled in.
1576960	1580960	Can you even read? Is that common amongst the Harfoots?
1580960	1587960	The Harfoots have developed a written language, yet they still rely on images.
1587960	1593960	And also, they're writing in books, while the Numenoreans still have a bunch of scrolls.
1593960	1595960	That's a good point.
1595960	1599960	They have books too, but mostly sort of scrolls.
1599960	1605960	The Harfoots are more technologically advanced than the Numenoreans.
1605960	1608960	Don't you like how quirky they are?
1608960	1609960	Love it.
1609960	1614960	You know, if I was ten, I would have really enjoyed that scene.
1614960	1615960	You would have?
1615960	1616960	Yes.
1616960	1617960	Really?
1617960	1619960	I can see it.
1619960	1622960	As a little kid, I never liked this sort of stuff.
1622960	1624960	But I guess that's the target audience.
1625960	1633960	You know, the raging fire and the alcohol somewhat undermines the whole camouflage idea of these people.
1633960	1634960	Yep.
1634960	1635960	Yeah.
1635960	1638960	They're brightly lit encampments. They're stealthy.
1638960	1642960	Millions of fireflies they probably have to gather.
1642960	1646960	They have captured a lot of fireflies.
1646960	1649960	Cultivate them.
1649960	1651960	They just have, like, firefly farms.
1651960	1652960	Yeah.
1654960	1660960	They likewise will be carried with us in our hearts and in our memories.
1660960	1665960	But their broken bodies will be left behind because we're savages like that.
1665960	1670960	We will just leave them to death.
1670960	1672960	Oh hey, it's Sauron.
1672960	1675960	You mean Gandalf?
1675960	1678960	Nope, there's going to be, like, eighty Saurons.
1678960	1681960	I like that one.
1681960	1682960	Gross.
1682960	1685960	Actually, you know what they'll do?
1685960	1690960	They'll make this guy one of the two blue wizards that didn't really have a story.
1690960	1691960	Oh, the blues.
1691960	1695960	Yeah, but they arrived along with the rest of them.
1695960	1697960	Like, they all arrived at the same time.
1697960	1699960	He's a wizard.
1699960	1701960	They're a wizard, Harry.
1701960	1703960	All the Harfoots are right there.
1703960	1707960	Yeah, but they're bees.
1708960	1712960	You got stung a lot, I guess.
1712960	1713960	Oh, she'll notice.
1713960	1716960	They'll laugh because he got stunned to death.
1716960	1717960	I called that close.
1717960	1718960	Dude, you're burning!
1718960	1720960	He's like, oh, shoot.
1720960	1722960	I needed more light to see, okay?
1722960	1724960	I'm really nearsighted.
1724960	1733960	Now, don't mind me as I set fire to the entire encampment and, uh...
1733960	1736960	Oops.
1736960	1739960	Laugh track.
1750960	1753960	Nori!
1753960	1755960	Everyone's gonna turn their heads towards her.
1755960	1756960	And she's gonna get...
1756960	1757960	How dare you?
1757960	1759960	She's gonna get exiled.
1759960	1765960	It's gonna be like a Princess Mononoke thing where she's thrown out of the tribe, eh?
1767960	1769960	Oh, Shell, this gang.
1769960	1773960	They really will not wait for her.
1773960	1774960	Oh, my God.
1774960	1776960	Can we go back to the sea people already?
1776960	1778960	They're doing Frodo, guys.
1778960	1779960	Can you feel it?
1779960	1781960	It's Frodo.
1781960	1782960	Femdo.
1782960	1784960	Femdo?
1788960	1790960	I mean, blue wizard's dead.
1790960	1793960	That's actually just me looking at my monetization.
1794960	1797960	Hey, they're talking about the franchise.
1797960	1799960	Are they?
1799960	1801960	Yeah, the past is dead.
1801960	1803960	Oh, shoot, if you have to.
1805960	1806960	I didn't pick up on it.
1806960	1808960	It's too late.
1808960	1810960	It's too late in the evening.
1816960	1818960	That's quite the statue, Jesus.
1824960	1828960	Oh, they're just gonna do the Aragorn story again.
1839960	1841960	Literally just Sargon.
1841960	1845960	Just a few questions as to how Galadriel just walked into jail.
1845960	1847960	Like, there's no guard stopping her.
1847960	1848960	She's just fine.
1848960	1851960	She's got the right to do this now.
1851960	1854960	Listen, Arch, the Elfa Sea unlocks a lot of doors, okay?
1854960	1859960	Ooh, maybe it will actually be Sauragorn.
1859960	1862960	And he'll be, like, mentally conflicted.
1862960	1864960	Like, should I be Sauron?
1864960	1867960	It's like, I really like Galadriel, though, like a lot.
1867960	1870960	Yeah, Galadriel convinces him to become Sauron.
1871960	1873960	Actually, you have to be king.
1873960	1875960	Do I? Yes, okay.
1875960	1877960	If that'll win you over, does it?
1877960	1879960	I don't want to be with you anymore.
1879960	1880960	What the fuck, woman?
1880960	1882960	You're evil now, Jesus.
1882960	1883960	Woman.
1883960	1885960	I'm trying to think about how impractical this is.
1887960	1889960	I try not to think about it, but I can't help it.
1889960	1891960	Listen, it was basically built by gods, okay?
1891960	1893960	They've got skills.
1893960	1895960	Fair enough.
1895960	1898960	I like some of the stats in Numenor, though, at least.
1898960	1900960	Five sticks.
1900960	1902960	The scrolls thing is starting to annoy me, too,
1902960	1906960	because they've got ridiculously high-level architectural skills.
1906960	1908960	But scrolls.
1908960	1910960	Yeah, scrolls are a bit more primitive.
1910960	1913960	I'm almost expecting them to have wax tablets.
1913960	1914960	Oh, not the hardwoods.
1914960	1916960	The stealthy cat-out hats.
1916960	1918960	I'd rather have the black elf, actually.
1918960	1920960	I love these things.
1920960	1922960	They're like, how do we make it stealthy?
1922960	1924960	We'll put, like, leaves on it.
1924960	1926960	Nobody will ever see it moving.
1926960	1929960	Are you going to leave a trail for the brandy books?
1931960	1934960	Ah, yes, make the guy with the broken fucking legs pull the cart.
1934960	1936960	Brilliant idea.
1937960	1939960	Maybe I'll have eggs with him.
1939960	1940960	Fuck it.
1940960	1942960	This time, get animals.
1942960	1944960	Get a horse, man.
1944960	1946960	Oh, it's a giant.
1946960	1947960	It's Sauron.
1947960	1949960	He's going to help him drag the cart.
1949960	1950960	Me and him.
1950960	1951960	Blueron.
1951960	1953960	Like, use him as slave labor.
1954960	1956960	Maybe more.
1956960	1959960	He's actually kind of cute and, like, lost puppy kind of way.
1959960	1962960	Fucking lost giant puppy.
1962960	1965960	He's the only character of interest in this arc, in my opinion.
1965960	1966960	Yeah.
1966960	1969960	They all are suspiciously white, aren't they?
1969960	1971960	And they're wearing white, too.
1971960	1973960	Oh, shit.
1973960	1976960	They would explain why they hate sunlight because they've got no melanin.
1977960	1978960	Mm.
1982960	1984960	They're sizzling.
1984960	1987960	It burns very conveniently now.
1987960	1988960	Not earlier, though.
1988960	1992960	Have you considered using bows, maybe?
1992960	1993960	Oh.
1993960	1994960	No throwing weapons.
1994960	1996960	I mean, that works, too.
1996960	1998960	Ah, good old-fashioned tug-of-war.
1998960	2000960	They're just tug-of-warring.
2000960	2003960	Fucking exhilarating.
2003960	2006960	Don't cut them down with your weapons or anything.
2006960	2008960	Let's pull them, Dorothy.
2013960	2014960	Was that easy?
2014960	2015960	Oh, no!
2015960	2019960	So, did orcs always burn from sunlight?
2019960	2020960	Uh, yes.
2020960	2021960	Okay.
2021960	2022960	Except for the urakai.
2022960	2025960	Because Saruman's urakai are special.
2025960	2026960	Right.
2026960	2027960	That's why they made a big deal about it.
2027960	2029960	Wolfers.
2030960	2033960	It's a barge, but it looks dumb.
2033960	2035960	Oh, god, it does look dumb.
2035960	2037960	It does look dumb, yes.
2037960	2039960	What the fuck is wrong with that?
2039960	2041960	What the fuck is with that thing?
2041960	2042960	That's some-
2042960	2045960	Is this a hog-bog?
2045960	2046960	Bog-bog.
2046960	2047960	Attack.
2047960	2048960	Oh, Jesus.
2048960	2050960	It's like a chihuahua.
2050960	2054960	I do like how they just let her die, by the way.
2054960	2056960	Oh, my god.
2056960	2058960	They're so fucking incompetent.
2058960	2059960	That's a killer.
2062960	2064960	Oh, don't worry, black elf to the rescue.
2066960	2069960	Oh, I saw Legolas do this once.
2070960	2071960	Oh, my god.
2071960	2072960	That face.
2072960	2074960	That thing's face.
2074960	2076960	Forget about the chain.
2076960	2078960	Just stab his ass.
2080960	2081960	Like so.
2081960	2083960	You stabbed him with a branch.
2083960	2084960	Oh, hey.
2084960	2087960	Wouldn't it be cool if the other orcs had bows and arrows, too?
2087960	2089960	I didn't expect that.
2089960	2095960	Did they think there wouldn't just be guards up above the trenches?
2098960	2099960	Now, why?
2101960	2103960	Because he's the main character, Kyle.
2103960	2104960	You can't just kill him.
2104960	2105960	Fuck.
2105960	2107960	Does it make sense for them not-
2107960	2110960	I mean, they killed everybody else, but not him.
2110960	2111960	Yes.
2111960	2114960	And now we need a reveal of Idar here.
2114960	2116960	And this is going to be Sauron.
2116960	2117960	They're all just Sauron.
2117960	2118960	No, no, no.
2118960	2119960	This is a red herring.
2119960	2121960	Like, this is too obvious.
2122960	2125960	Yeah, Idar's like a sub-commander or something like that.
2125960	2126960	Yeah.
2127960	2128960	He's an elf.
2129960	2130960	Yeah.
2130960	2131960	He's a motherfucking elf.
2132960	2134960	Yeah, there's the way he's Sauron.
2134960	2135960	And there ends the episode.
2135960	2136960	He's a fucking elf.
2137960	2138960	Wow.
2138960	2139960	Well, hold on.
2139960	2143960	Didn't Sauron appear to the elves as a fellow elf, in fact?
2143960	2144960	Kib, stop it, Kibs.
2145960	2146960	Stop what?
2146960	2148960	The preview of episode four.
2148960	2149960	Okay.
2149960	2151960	I stopped it just in time.
2151960	2153960	Okay, so yeah, that was episode three.
2153960	2155960	What did you all think?
2155960	2158960	I mean, it was better than one and two.
2158960	2159960	That's true.
2159960	2160960	That actually happened.
2160960	2166960	This is kind of the House of the Dragon problem as well, where you start in the middle of
2166960	2167960	the goddamn story.
2167960	2170960	Like, episode one and two was practically pointless.
2170960	2173960	Very little was established other than introducing the characters, which could have been done
2173960	2174960	in an hour.
2174960	2175960	Easy.
2175960	2176960	Yeah.
2176960	2178960	Now, finally, the ball is rolling.
2178960	2181960	And I mean, it's better because something is happening.
2182960	2183960	That's true.
2183960	2184960	Yes, I agree.
2184960	2185960	I like what they're doing with Halbrand.
2185960	2189960	He's the most interesting part of the show now, is Halbrand.
2189960	2191960	You know what's happening here?
2191960	2194960	You know what this show has turned into?
2194960	2199960	It's turned into a $5 billion production of Find Wally, as we were like, this is Sauron.
2199960	2200960	That's Sauron.
2201960	2202960	Oh, wait.
2203960	2204960	Sauron.
2204960	2209960	What if the big twist by the end of the season is that all of these plotlines are happening
2209960	2213960	at different time periods and they're all Sauron?
2213960	2215960	That's what I was suggesting earlier.
2215960	2217960	Like, I would not be surprised.
2217960	2222960	Like, in one of the other ones, the Southland's already fallen and they don't know it yet.
2222960	2223960	Yep.
2223960	2228960	The thing is, like, I actually wouldn't mind that because if they managed to do it subtly,
2228960	2231960	it can actually be a rather clever twist.
2231960	2234960	Like, oh, look, these are all my machinations, right?
2234960	2235960	You know?
2235960	2236960	I am Sauron.
2236960	2237960	I've done all of this.
2237960	2240960	But are they that clever, though?
2240960	2241960	No.
2241960	2243960	Well, I guess we will see.
2243960	2246960	We didn't get any Elrond this time.
2246960	2248960	No elrond, no dwarves.
2248960	2250960	Honestly, this is probably for the best.
2250960	2255960	The other episodes having all of the story arcs intermixed was a disaster in my opinion.
2255960	2259960	Because it was just, and then then and then and then, and just like, and this group, and
2259960	2261960	then now this group is doing something.
2261960	2266960	Stuff actually happens when we actually focus an episode on only a couple arcs at a time.
2266960	2269960	It needed more focus, certainly.
2269960	2274960	So if the show slows itself down and gives like, okay, this episode is dedicated to these
2274960	2278960	two groups of characters rather than jumping around all the time.
2278960	2283960	The Hogwarts are still an incredibly unnecessary element.
2283960	2287960	Yeah, the only interesting thing the Harfoots have going isn't the Harfoots.
2287960	2290960	It's the it's the dude, the big dude, tall dude.
2290960	2291960	It's Blueron.
2291960	2297960	It's just here's the thing, though, of the last time we did this, the most interesting
2297960	2302960	part of of that first video that we did was was Durin.
2302960	2304960	So it's kind of sad to see him again.
2304960	2306960	He'll get his own episode.
2306960	2311960	Again, if they're going to slow it down and focus, then maybe we'll get more do it in
2311960	2317960	the next episode, because this this was Black Elf, Harfoots and Galadriel's arcs.
2317960	2319960	And nothing really happened with the Black Elf.
2319960	2323960	Like, OK, he's a slave and they had like a failed revolt to go.
2323960	2328960	See, the problem with the story line is it seems.
2328960	2329960	Yeah, right at the end.
2329960	2330960	Yeah, right at the end.
2330960	2331960	They just kind of hint it.
2331960	2332960	Yeah.
2332960	2336960	The Black Elf storyline hasn't done anything.
2336960	2339960	It's still at the exact same spot.
2339960	2344960	Like, what reason do we have to give a shit about his adventures?
2344960	2347960	It shows the fate of the Southlands, what it's going to do.
2347960	2348960	That's my my theory.
2348960	2351960	And it's going to also show us Adar, whoever this guy is.
2351960	2355960	Well, that's true, I guess because Galadriel is talking about the Southlands.
2355960	2356960	Oh, that's what it is.
2356960	2358960	It's actually going to be Mordor in the future.
2358960	2361960	And his story arc takes place there.
2361960	2364960	So it's going to be more about the location, less about him.
2364960	2365960	That's the thing, though.
2365960	2370960	One of the brilliant things about Lord of the Rings was that it told you a lot of things
2370960	2372960	without explaining them in detail.
2372960	2374960	It made them mysterious.
2374960	2377960	Like they were talking about, you know, dark things.
2377960	2381960	I don't know if we need to see the Southlands form.
2381960	2383960	Because otherwise it's not going to be Mordor.
2383960	2388960	Yeah, but wouldn't it be more interesting if the people of the Southlands just went quiet or something?
2388960	2392960	Instead of having this where it's a Black Elf going like,
2392960	2393960	Well, I'm here.
2393960	2397960	Entire garrisons of elves overrun instantly off screen.
2397960	2401960	Where they just like, they close the gates and then like all communication stops.
2401960	2403960	And then some of the fuck happened over there.
2403960	2404960	It's like a mystery.
2404960	2409960	But the issue is that I am not a fan of the elf garrison because that was the problem.
2409960	2413960	How the hell do you have this band of randos overtaking elf garrison?
2413960	2414960	Well, you don't.
2414960	2416960	So you just don't.
2416960	2418960	We just don't show it.
2418960	2425960	But the problem is, is we should, in my opinion, story wise, we should see the Southlands fall and learn a little bit of how it falls.
2425960	2430960	But the execution is so bad that we're better off not seeing it because they did it so poorly.
2430960	2435960	Well, Kibbs, the execution is so bad we're better off not watching the show.
2435960	2436960	That's true.
2436960	2439960	Not seeing any of it at all.
2439960	2442960	Yeah, I don't know what else I have to say about it.
2442960	2447960	The first two episodes we could nitpick to shit because there was so much wrong with it.
2447960	2451960	But this one, it's like, oh, it's turned into like competent TV.
2451960	2454960	And it being competent means it's like, oh, well, it's there.
2454960	2456960	It's committing the cardinal sin.
2456960	2457960	It's no longer so bad.
2457960	2458960	It's good.
2458960	2460960	It's now it's just mediocre.
2460960	2463960	The issue is this is after two hours.
2463960	2470960	Like we are three hours into a TV show now and we have just finally been introduced to the scenario.
2470960	2476960	When it comes to the Lord of the Rings extended edition, that's like 12 hours of stuff you can watch.
2476960	2478960	At the three hour mark.
2478960	2479960	At the three hour mark.
2479960	2480960	Where are you?
2480960	2483960	You're basically at the part where they are.
2483960	2485960	They're they're exiting Moria.
2485960	2487960	Yes, that's what I thought to be.
2487960	2491960	It'd be around the exiting Moria and getting into Galadriel's realm.
2491960	2495960	A shit ton has happened at that point in the story.
2495960	2497960	Yep, there's you could talk about it for hours.
2497960	2504960	Honestly, all the stuff that happened, all the nuances of what happened in Moria, all Frodo and them and the forming of the fellowship.
2505960	2511960	In this show, at the three hour mark, we've basically just left the Shire.
2511960	2515960	Yeah, this slow pacing hasn't benefited the show.
2515960	2522960	Like, I care no more about Black Elf now than I did three hours previously.
2522960	2524960	Yeah, honestly, we could cut out.
2524960	2532960	Honestly, episode one, A Shadow of the Past and episode two, Adrift, cut those two out and then skip to three.
2532960	2535960	There's so little.
2535960	2540960	Skip to three, slap on 10, 20 minutes of exposition.
2540960	2543960	Like, have the elves, you know, they're having a happy day.
2543960	2545960	You know, they're just doing their shit.
2545960	2548960	Then the orcs sneak in, ambush them, drag them away.
2548960	2550960	I mean, skip the boat entirely.
2550960	2553960	Just have her be on Numenor.
2553960	2555960	On Numenor?
2555960	2557960	Yes, for some reason.
2557960	2559960	Because the entire part of that is just dumb.
2559960	2564960	Like, the swim home part is the stupidest thing I've seen in television in a long time.
2564960	2569960	You just start swimming off into the horizon and you're like, oh, okay.
2569960	2571960	That wasn't for plot armor.
2571960	2575960	She'd just be dead, dead, dead, immediate, no survival.
2575960	2580960	But then again, I mean, if Numenor is barred from the elves, how do you get her there?
2580960	2582960	Oh, you have to get there by circumstance.
2582960	2583960	How do you do that?
2583960	2584960	Oh, with the shipwreck.
2584960	2585960	How do you get her to her shipwreck?
2585960	2591960	Well, the only time we know that the elves actually do any sort of sailing is when they're going off to their homeland.
2591960	2593960	So we've got to get her on one of those boats.
2593960	2594960	So how do we do that?
2594960	2596960	Oh, we've got to honor her somehow.
2596960	2602960	And then, like, you can follow their logic back, but it's all just contrived.
2602960	2608960	And the problem too is, the Numenor storyline has been so ridiculously special.
2608960	2611960	Like, the fall of Numenor is supposed to be the fall of Numenor.
2611960	2616960	It's supposed to be the slow corruption of the people against the Valar and against the elves.
2616960	2626960	But not only have we skipped that, we've gone past it to the point now that they have instituted an ethnostate that hates all non-Numenorians.
2626960	2635960	I mean, we're not even talking about the lore inconsistencies now, because you could get started there and never stop.
2635960	2637960	Don't be a racist, Arch.
2637960	2638960	Yeah.
2638960	2640960	This is just the story we're talking about here.
2640960	2642960	Like, this could be done a lot better.
2642960	2654960	And I feel like maybe they're resting on the idea that this is going to be a five-season thing and that this will be something epic and people won't mind the first two hours.
2654960	2663960	But at the same time, if the Fellowship of the Rings was just two hours of Frodo fucking about in the Shire, would anyone watch it?
2663960	2666960	I mean, I've watched that over this.
2666960	2670960	But not very much.
2670960	2674960	I'm guessing that they're trying to take, like, oh, we're in a TV show.
2674960	2678960	Let's just take the extra time we have.
2678960	2682960	But then they run into the risk of just boring people.
2682960	2689960	I guess I would rather there be more than too much than too little.
2689960	2691960	Are you sure about that, though?
2691960	2693960	Because you can definitely get too much.
2694960	2699960	Fair enough. I feel like we've been getting a bit much with the Harfoots.
2699960	2700960	Yeah.
2700960	2703960	Fucking Harfoots.
2703960	2706960	I'm not going to go away. That's the worst part.
2706960	2707960	Yeah.
2707960	2709960	Like, the Harfoots are just unbelievably uninteresting.
2709960	2712960	Like, they have no role in the story. They shouldn't be here.
2712960	2719960	The only reason they're there is because the showrunners were so blinded by the established thing that had gone before it.
2719960	2725960	They were like, we must have Harpets. We can't have Harpets. Harpets didn't exist. We must have Harpets.
2725960	2730960	Oh, they need to detach themselves from the fact that they have to be like the Lord of the Rings movies.
2730960	2737960	Because by doing that, they're shackling themselves to the idea that they're competing to be that thing that was so good.
2737960	2740960	And so they're already setting themselves up for failure.
2740960	2745960	Yet at the same time, though, they're not adopting any of the positive aspects of the movies.
2745960	2746960	Goodness.
2747960	2749960	Why does that thing exist?
2749960	2754960	That thing is in the uncanny valley. It's not scary. It's a dumb look.
2754960	2759960	That had some weird CG going on with it. Something wasn't right there.
2759960	2762960	They'll spend some extra hours in the bakery.
2762960	2765960	Yeah. I mean, I don't know what the heck they were thinking.
2765960	2772960	The Vargs from the Lord of the Rings, like, the original trilogy, yeah, they're like hyenas crossed with, like, some sort of horse thing.
2772960	2775960	But you know what? Whatever. It looks alright.
2775960	2781960	These things, or that thing, I don't know what the heck that was. It did not look right. It looked a little derpy.
2781960	2783960	Well, a pug barg.
2783960	2785960	It did look like a pug barg.
2785960	2787960	It had the balding eyes, too.
2787960	2789960	Man, it did not look healthy.
2789960	2801960	If you spend a billion dollars in the show, and you're gonna, you know, work a dozen VFX artists to death every single day to get it out, you gotta make it look better than that.
2801960	2805960	But obviously they didn't work enough VFX artists to death, Dev.
2805960	2808960	That's true. She's got a point.
2808960	2811960	We gotta sacrifice more South Koreans.
2811960	2819960	The city scenes themselves don't look half bad, but that Varg, oh, that was vain to look at.
2819960	2827960	Alright, it's 2am, and I gotta edit this before going to bed, and Arch, you're probably ready to collapse, so...
2827960	2831960	It's time, isn't it? It's time to wrap it up for today.
2831960	2834960	Fun and games. Fun and games.
2834960	2838960	So we'll be back again next week for more of this nonsense.
2838960	2840960	Thanks for being here, guys.
2840960	2843960	And thank you.
2843960	2848960	I wish I could say it was a pleasure.
2848960	2854960	But we're watching Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power, so...
2854960	2856960	It is what it is.
