1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
So, it's been one week, and I don't know if you guys have noticed, but Amazon still hasn't

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,680
allowed anybody to put reviews up of this show.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,520
In a very long 72 hours.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,200
I've checked my review, and every time I check my review, it's like, oh, would you like to

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
publish this?

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,200
I'm like, yes, publish.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,240
I'm like, okay, we're publishing it.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,240
Refresh page.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,480
Would you like to publish this?

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,560
Maybe reviews are having an effect.

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,560
Amazon is scared.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,960
Like, they wouldn't do this if they wouldn't, because you gotta understand how bad this

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,660
looks for the normies.

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,660
Like hold on.

15
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,660
Why can't I review this?

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,360
Why are they holding reviews for 72 hours?

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,860
It's been 72 hours.

18
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,740
Why aren't there any reviews?

19
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,640
Like the normies may be sheep, but they're not idiots.

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Yep.

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
It's a big red flag.

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,540
Well, do you guys think this will be like the Amy Schumer special where eventually Amazon

23
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,260
just takes out the ability to review because of this?

24
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,260
Like entirely?

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Like in perpetuity?

26
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,260
Yeah.

27
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,040
Oh jeez, that'd be funny.

28
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,800
It might be, because it would avoid further headaches, but like it's already too late.

29
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:18,860
The Rings of Power is a joke, and it is going to be held up as an example of like bad corporate

30
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,060
production for a decade to come.

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,300
Wait, what's all that clicking?

32
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,660
Is it, are you like fidget spinning arch or something?

33
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,620
I'm trying to hold it as far away from the microphone as I can, but I've got one of those

34
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:33,140
grip trainers that I'm using to keep myself awake right now.

35
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,140
Oh, that's right.

36
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,820
We're doing this at 6 AM year time.

37
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,820
Jesus.

38
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,260
Oh my God, hang in there blondie.

39
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,740
Somebody send that man a Coke.

40
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,460
I have had two, but at this point I just need to do something and the grip trainer exhausts

41
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,580
me enough to keep me awake.

42
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,000
Jesus.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,960
So on the, the, the prime video site for Canada, it does show at the very least the IMDB score,

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
which is 6.7% currently.

45
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Yep.

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,960
It shows the same for US.

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,960
Yeah.

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
All right.

49
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,160
And that is off the massive censorship.

50
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Yes.

51
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Jesus.

52
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
That's, that's a pretty big oof.

53
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
There's still person abuse by the way.

54
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Yeah.

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
I'm not surprised.

56
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
Arch, you and I both talked about hate watching.

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,240
I mean, it turns out that putting out reviews does in fact have an effect.

58
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,600
I think we were both correct on that.

59
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Yeah.

60
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Like obviously.

61
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,800
You gotta remember the normies, their only real frame of reference is the reviews.

62
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,100
Like they don't watch us.

63
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,040
They don't even watch the mainstream media.

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,580
They look at IMDB, they look at Rotten Tomatoes and okay, is this show good?

65
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,040
And those that do look at reviews, notice that the market's been cornered because Amazon

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,400
has removed the reviewing system.

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,640
Well, now our reviews are even getting more hits than they otherwise would.

68
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
Yep.

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
And then they'll get suspicious.

70
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,240
Like, hold on, why aren't there any reviews for this show?

71
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,120
And then they might actually go to Google and go like rings of power reviews.

72
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,020
And then the shit will pop up.

73
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,600
Thank you algorithm.

74
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,160
And speaking of actually watching it on Prime Video, I got raked over the coals last week

75
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,960
for because of the fact that like we streamed it from Prime Video.

76
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,980
Listen, I'm going to sell Kibs up the river right now.

77
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,980
It wasn't me.

78
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,040
Kibs is the one presenting this feed to you guys.

79
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,400
I wouldn't watch this on Amazon.

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I would pirate this if I was going to do it.

81
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,840
You can definitely blame me for it.

82
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
No big deal.

83
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,600
Like I use Amazon because I live out in the middle of Minnesota in the middle of nowhere,

84
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
right?

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,200
I saw a burn down.

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
I'm not going to.

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,080
So a few things have happened before we start, we'll just I just want to give you a couple

88
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,880
of a little bit more context, okay?

89
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,560
So in the week, the week since since we've all, you know, convened, and the end of reviews

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,040
haven't been been allowed to be posted, we've started to see stuff like this, for example,

91
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,120
Amazon's the rings of powers.

92
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:46,720
The rings of powers is what the is what the article says, is not for purists or racists.

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,600
And this article, yes, they're conflating people who care about Tolkien's lore and sticking

94
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,700
to the story with racism.

95
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,860
You might not like it if you're a purist or a racist.

96
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,620
That's how you know a show's good.

97
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,920
Like they have to fall behind that and just accuse anybody who might criticize it.

98
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,680
Well, you just don't like my show because you're fucking racist.

99
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,140
And hey, I admit, I do not like the diversity.

100
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,340
And so far, the diversity has been the only real genuine sign of wokeism.

101
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,820
But the thing is, I don't dislike the diversity, because they're brown.

102
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,720
I dislike the diversity because there's a fantasy setting where they don't exist.

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,420
And here's the thing too.

104
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,020
Nothing is stopping them from making a story with a diverse cast.

105
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,460
Like we mentioned the last time they have a village in the Southlands, like in an area

106
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,740
that should be on the border of Rhun or Kandar.

107
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,940
These people should be brown, and yet they are white.

108
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,660
To your villages normally will, but you see, carrying about lower is a sign of racism,

109
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,660
apparently.

110
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,460
Yeah, we don't want that.

111
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,140
So it's got to be an ethnostate village.

112
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,980
See, I had this talk about the light tier movie and the lesbian kids, because a lot

113
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,780
of people are up in arms about that.

114
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,100
And I looked, I was like, this is nothing like it's a loving family.

115
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,180
It's a quick peck on the lips.

116
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,180
This is not a problem.

117
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,180
Yeah.

118
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,780
I don't remember who put it in there, and suddenly it's not just a loving family and

119
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,780
a peck on the lips.

120
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,420
It is the agenda.

121
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,980
There's a reason why it's there.

122
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,820
I still think that wasn't a big deal, to be honest.

123
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,820
It's just whatever.

124
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,980
They didn't do anything with it.

125
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,980
It's okay for me.

126
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,820
It doesn't bother me in the slightest.

127
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,620
I just dislike the underhanded nature.

128
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,220
If they just have it in there and it's like, oh, it's just a thing that happens in the

129
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,220
story.

130
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,220
Not a big deal.

131
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,440
They're only depicting female on female lesbian relationships.

132
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,720
We need full on male, male gay sex.

133
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,840
That's that's what you know.

134
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,340
They're truly brave.

135
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,260
And they got to play it in Saudi Arabia.

136
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,260
Yes.

137
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,260
No, zero censorship.

138
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:59,120
Well, in the face of all of this racism and all of these racist negative reviews, we had

139
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,860
the official Twitter account of the show post, we stand in solidarity with our cast.

140
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,740
They're doing the same thing that was done in regards to Moses Ingram for the Kenobi

141
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,260
show and every show right now that's getting blasted for being just a terrible piece of

142
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
shit.

143
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
This always ends up happening, right?

144
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,300
The official Twitter account comes out, posts a big, long diatribe.

145
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,580
Everyone's cheering it on and going, yes, Queen Slakes, it's fucking Twitter and it's

146
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,740
a garbage pile.

147
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,540
You can almost predict these things.

148
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,120
It's like you're in the Matrix and you can just see all of it instead of the code.

149
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,120
You can see exactly what they're going to do exactly what they're going to say before

150
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
it even happens.

151
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,400
Well, you can see anybody can see it from a while away is this like it's the go to for

152
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,960
any big corporate project, especially Disneyland.

153
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,920
In relation to all of this, did you guys see the new Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power

154
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
merch?

155
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
No, I haven't.

156
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,660
Amazon got together the four original actors for the hobbits, the four hobbits, and they're

157
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,500
peddling these hats and T-shirts that say in Elvish, you are all welcome here.

158
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,540
And then it shows a bunch of different ears, human ears and elf ears of all different colors.

159
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,700
That's the dumbest and boringest thing I think I've ever heard from merch.

160
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,820
It's the cringiest fucking thing I've seen in a while.

161
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:24,220
Like, not like cool little figurines or soldiers or action characters or maybe like a cool

162
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,020
comic or something that looks atrocious.

163
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,900
That looks so sad.

164
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,780
So if you want to support Rings of Power, you got to buy this T-shirt or else you're

165
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,020
one of the racists.

166
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,580
They also look so old and sad.

167
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,660
Like they don't look like they won't even be there.

168
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,660
It doesn't even jump out and scream.

169
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,100
This is Lord of the Rings.

170
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,260
Come on, Kibs, thirty nine ninety nine.

171
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,060
Show your fucking nine ninety nine for that.

172
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:02,820
Are you shitting me for a shitty shirt that has some sort of stains on it?

173
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:09,820
I also need to point out that just like the Riva thing, Ismael Cruz, the black elf, also

174
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,900
had on day one on launch the announcement that he was receiving racist hatred.

175
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,460
Yeah, in fact, I remember that because I said this again in my Kenobi video where Disney

176
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,900
basically told Moses Ingram, you're going to get racist shit for this.

177
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,160
And we're kind of counting on it because that becomes a really good headline.

178
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,220
Please tell us as soon as you get anything, man, we really are at the point where it's

179
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:42,700
like in order to help the grand political project, you must watch the worst fucking

180
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,180
dog shit TV imaginable.

181
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,700
And if nothing else, it will send yet another loud and clear message to Amazon, because

182
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,500
also the various companies have been turning again.

183
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,380
I keep saying you can't give up just because it didn't happen instantly, that all of these

184
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,460
companies went unwoke instantly.

185
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,920
It takes months and years for them to do anything.

186
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,860
And at the end of the day, it's very simple.

187
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,780
Reward good stuff, punish bad stuff, and sooner or later, the message will shine through.

188
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,260
Well, I think it's time for this episode to shine through you guys.

189
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,260
You guys ready?

190
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,260
No.

191
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
Nope.

192
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:28,300
Lord of the Rings, Rings of Power, season one, episode three, Adar, Adar, Adar, I think

193
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,260
this might be the corrupted elf we heard about.

194
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,260
Let's roll.

195
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,140
All right.

196
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:41,180
So I keep hearing that this guy might not be Sauron, but Gandalf, Mauler was telling

197
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,180
me that.

198
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,060
If it is, that would be an even bigger lore break than it being Sauron, because Gandalf

199
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:54,020
is alive right now, like he's in the other land to the west.

200
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
He's a person.

201
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,940
Like he went to Middle Earth on a mission, along with the other wizards.

202
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,100
He didn't just fucking dump there one day.

203
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:07,140
Yeah, it could be, see, I could see it being a red herring because it's too obvious, but

204
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:14,340
it's one of the things where like, okay, then who is?

205
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,340
Maybe they just killed them.

206
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,780
Maybe we'll never see him again.

207
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,780
Wouldn't that be lovely?

208
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,780
That would be nice.

209
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,860
You want me to skip the intro, by the way, I can if you want.

210
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,780
Dev likes the intro, doesn't he?

211
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,240
This is something else that shows do these days where they're like, they make things

212
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,720
like this to be epic because they somehow believe that they deserve it.

213
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,460
They haven't achieved anything yet, and it's like, oh my God, look at this.

214
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,560
It was also popularized by Game of Thrones with that, honestly, really good opening intro

215
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,200
with all of the clockwork machinations and shit, and now everyone does it.

216
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Yeah.

217
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,360
Well, to be fair, House of the Dragon's doing a kind of decent one, but it's like flowing

218
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
wax or something.

219
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
I think it's blood.

220
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
What, I'd imagine.

221
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
You think it's blood?

222
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
Yeah.

223
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Well, the entire idea of the Targaryens is that, you know, their blood is special.

224
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
Yeah, I guess.

225
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,860
But of the Targaryens' fluid.

226
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,480
The orcs have elected to not kill their arch enemy, the elf, for some reason.

227
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,220
That's because they're actually misunderstood, okay?

228
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:24,440
Here we have the Ku Klux Klan orcs in their hoods.

229
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,520
Yeah, why are they all wearing hoods?

230
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:35,560
Because it makes them look more KKK-ish.

231
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
What's the entire garrison?

232
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Oh my God.

233
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
What the fuck happened?

234
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
What the fuck?

235
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,560
They're still in Navjd.

236
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
What the fuck?

237
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,560
They suck.

238
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,600
So we let them dance for us alive.

239
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,900
You guys were soldiers.

240
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,400
You had weapons in the tower.

241
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,320
What happened, and why didn't we see that?

242
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,680
Alright, well, now we know why she didn't run to the garrison, because the garrison

243
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,680
was already run by elf-time orcs.

244
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,040
From before this guy saw her own.

245
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,920
Is it Black Queen time?

246
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
I didn't know the new middle-eastern universe.

247
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,680
Well, you know, it's the modern day.

248
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,880
My dagger.

249
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,560
My ice-climbing pick.

250
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,760
Oh, time for some more grand CGI, I think.

251
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,240
So is it just me, or does she only have one facial expression this entire show?

252
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Constantly petulant, yes.

253
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,360
It's like women aren't allowed to express themselves anymore.

254
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Slightly constipated.

255
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
Slightly constipated.

256
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,360
And here's the thing, you can do that kind of a character.

257
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,280
You can do, like, the female hero from Kill La Kill or something, but it doesn't work

258
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
with Galadriel.

259
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
That's kind of the point.

260
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
She has a character, yeah.

261
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:58,720
Other than, like, Ryoko from Kill La Kill, her emotion was at least vivid, anger, just

262
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,960
anger, whereas she's just kind of mildly annoyed at everything around her.

263
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,040
Again, it's a strong female character.

264
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,760
The chick from House of the Dragon's the same, frumpy.

265
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,740
That seems to be the emotion of strong female character.

266
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,000
Like Rey, too.

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Constantly petulant.

268
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Look, she has to deal with men, okay?

269
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's enough.

270
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We should tell Galadriel to smile more.

271
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Oof.

272
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Cancelled.

273
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
In the Great Wall, your ancestors stood with Morgoth.

274
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
How the fuck do you know his ancestry?

275
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Do you smell it on him?

276
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
As a reward, the Valar granted on this island.

277
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,880
Hold on, I'm noticing this now.

278
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,120
She's rolling every single R when it's a foreign word.

279
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,820
It feels like, this is going to be a Canadian joke, it feels like she's rolling up the rim

280
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,820
to win.

281
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,820
So Sauron is already here, because he's turning them against the elves.

282
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,940
I think as time drifted, I don't remember, but I believe the Numenoreans did drift apart

283
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,940
from the elves.

284
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,820
Yeah, but a lot of that was specifically Sauron.

285
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:07,500
Because Sauron comes into play off the whole thing about like, oh, Valar, they're denying

286
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,660
you, the immortality.

287
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:16,880
Well, some people are saying that this guy is Sauron.

288
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,020
This guy, I could see it, it would be really cringe, but I could see it.

289
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,400
And they're going to do like a Galadriel-Sauron romance.

290
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,980
Oh, stop.

291
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,620
Where she gets betrayed.

292
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,100
I don't think they would do that.

293
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,960
The worst part is I can see it.

294
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
I don't want to.

295
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,960
It could be bad if he did.

296
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,960
You're near the fuck.

297
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Ew.

298
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Gross.

299
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Untermich.

300
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Wait, he was checking her out.

301
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Sure.

302
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,960
I mean, she's still wearing the bathrobe they found her in.

303
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
Oh my god.

304
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,960
Ah, yes, the Black Queen of the Numenoreans.

305
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Smelt nasty in there.

306
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Another one was black.

307
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Every R, man.

308
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Yes, she does it all every goddamn R.

309
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
He's Sauron.

310
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
Look at how charismatic he is.

311
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
We can't have a competent male.

312
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,960
I am still not sure that the show isn't going to do a Witcher thing and turn out that there's

313
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,960
like five fucking Saurons.

314
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Well, I'm going to go to bed then.

315
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
He does have to be evil.

316
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,960
He's going to be evil, yeah.

317
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
For longer than you know.

318
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,960
He is raising some flags, it's true.

319
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,960
Sounds like I want to get a little bit, you know, just a little something before I become

320
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
a Dark Lord.

321
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Is he someone we should know?

322
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
That's Isildur.

323
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,960
The guy we're just seeing there in that scene a second ago.

324
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Yep.

325
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
Elendil's son is Isildur.

326
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Right, the guy who ends up with the one ring in the intro of Fellowship.

327
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
Yep, correct.

328
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,960
It's a time for Isildur to celebrate his bravery.

329
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Prove you're not just a nepotism hire.

330
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Those sales are very stupid, I just want to point that out.

331
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,960
Sometimes the cinematography makes me think this might be a good show.

332
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,960
And then I am reminded by what we're watching.

333
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
The sea is always right.

334
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
The sea is a cairn.

335
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,960
There you are.

336
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Jesus.

337
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,960
Those are some Shapiro milkers.

338
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Wait, hold on.

339
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Are they persecuting him based on his last name?

340
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Yep.

341
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,960
So in the lore, didn't Numenor sink into the ocean?

342
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Yes.

343
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
They broke a man.

344
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Yeah, it's basically just like...

345
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Atlantis.

346
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Yes, that's what I was thinking of. Atlantis.

347
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,960
And then the Numenoreans became the kings of Gondor.

348
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Are all of the orcs just pale white now?

349
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
Yeah, they were black skinned before, weren't they?

350
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
Yeah.

351
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Not necessarily uniformly black, but they certainly weren't that white.

352
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Very educated orcs, too. Very smooth-spoken.

353
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,960
I recently watched all three of the original movies with Naomi,

354
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,960
and they basically seemed like anarchists that Sauron whipped into shape, but only temporarily.

355
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,960
I mean, they're intended to be wild and animalistic, brutish.

356
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Gonna get it.

357
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
Oh, Jesus.

358
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Okay.

359
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
I mean, one of them was gonna die, you could tell.

360
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Yeah.

361
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,960
Also, that is not bleeding much for a fucking neck wood.

362
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
I mean, he's not dead, dude.

363
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
What the fuck? He's not dead.

364
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Nope, he's dead.

365
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
He's barely bleeding.

366
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
He's fine.

367
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
I mean, he's dead.

368
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
I've had worse shaving accidents.

369
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Listen, elves only have a little bit of blood in them, alright?

370
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Apparently.

371
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
He's not dead.

372
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
No, don't leave him.

373
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
He's not...

374
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Never fucking mind.

375
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
He's dead now.

376
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
He's dead.

377
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
Dad shows us he's dead.

378
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Okay.

379
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Very well, TV show.

380
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
That is a very stupid axe.

381
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,960
And also, it's like, okay, great job.

382
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Now you have less people to cut down on trees.

383
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,960
Could Amazon not afford the ketchup?

384
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
They're gonna be there a while, dude.

385
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
Takes a lot to cut down on trees.

386
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
Yeah.

387
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,960
At least the orcs don't like being in the sun.

388
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Except for the fact that they were standing in the sun.

389
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Except for when they do, yes.

390
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,960
See, I was gonna compliment them on that touch.

391
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
I was like, oh, you know that.

392
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
And then they do that.

393
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,960
As they're all standing in the sun, like, yeah, it's whatever.

394
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
Show.

395
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Yeah.

396
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
Hide your ears.

397
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
It's the only identifiable feature of an elf.

398
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,960
At least in this universe, where they're just humans.

399
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Yeah, I guess if you were an elf on a stealth mission, and it were, you know, not this show,

400
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,960
you'd just be glowing down the hallway.

401
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
It's like, oops.

402
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Fucking bloodthirsty.

403
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Yeah.

404
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Jesus.

405
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Immediate jumps, I'm gonna fucking kill you.

406
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
I guess she likes riding horses.

407
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,960
Caleb.

408
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Also, I wanna point out something as well here.

409
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Uh, Elendil was called Elendil the Tall as one of his names because he was like two and

410
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
a half meters.

411
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Well, maybe they couldn't quite do that.

412
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,960
I mean, they can't make the hobbits look small, so I guess it would be difficult to make him

413
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
look tall.

414
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Quit pointing out these things, Arch, okay?

415
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Well, who the fuck are you gonna get to play him?

416
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Yao Ming?

417
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Yes.

418
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,960
Well, the thing is, in the Lord of the Rings movies, they managed to use tricks to make

419
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,960
the characters look taller or smaller.

420
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Oh god, is that Galadriel's smile?

421
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
Please, go back.

422
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Yes.

423
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,960
Go back to, go back to being grumpy.

424
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
We need to not know what we asked for.

425
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
No, what the fuck?

426
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
Stop.

427
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Actually, that's kinda great.

428
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Like, she looks like a fucking shark smile.

429
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,960
I bet it looks sadistic and evil.

430
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,960
It's better than just having her perma-skull for the entire show.

431
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Yeah, I guess maybe.

432
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
I don't know.

433
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Where did he get money from?

434
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
He probably pick-pocketed it.

435
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
He's stealing from everyone.

436
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Did your guild seal?

437
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
No, no, the seal.

438
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
He doesn't give a fuck.

439
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
That's funny.

440
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
Oh, they're mad.

441
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
He's too charismatic!

442
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
You know what?

443
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,960
I will say he's at least, like, interesting in a way that the first two episodes weren't.

444
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Yep, and there goes the Guild of Crests.

445
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
He just, he's sniping it.

446
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Yep.

447
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
He's got it.

448
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,960
I mean, he's the, he's, yeah, no, he's better than Disa.

449
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,960
He's the most interesting character so far, just because I can't tell if he's just a lovable

450
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
rogue or something.

451
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,960
He's too, he's too good.

452
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,960
I'm hoping he's just a lovable rogue, because it just would be more interesting.

453
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
Oh, they noticed.

454
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,960
Darn.

455
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,960
I mean, your captain didn't notice lifting a fucking dagger off him, so.

456
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Because apparently he's ridiculously good at fighting.

457
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Charismatic.

458
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Very.

459
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Oh!

460
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Nice.

461
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Ridiculously strong.

462
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Fucking rude.

463
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,960
I think he is strong.

464
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,960
I mean, that's not human strength.

465
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,960
That was, that was the entire fucking arm bone there.

466
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,960
That was quick.

467
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Self-defense.

468
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,960
At least, at least the police force is good.

469
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,960
Quick response time.

470
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,960
There's no Second Amendment on Numenor, though.

471
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
True.

472
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,960
There's a lot of scrolls.

473
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
You'd think they'd have books by now.

474
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Yeah, but scrolls are more fancy and old-timey.

475
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Yeah, I guess so.

476
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
Oh, there's a book.

477
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
There's a few books.

478
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,960
Well, they combine books and scrolls for the worst possible keep-a-jib knowledge.

479
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
Good.

480
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,960
They haven't made, they haven't made the transition fully over yet.

481
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
They got one guy copying it and used it really slowly.

482
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Yeah, the Numenor story has been...

483
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,960
...accelerated.

484
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,960
I don't mind it.

485
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Stuff's actually happening.

486
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Better than the Harvards.

487
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Wait.

488
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,960
I'm confused as to where the Southlands is.

489
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
Is the Southlands Mordor?

490
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Yes.

491
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,960
That's what it looks like.

492
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Yeah, it kind of does.

493
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
Why'd you write that down?

494
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Ah.

495
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Yes.

496
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Sauron was like, hmm, my god might lose.

497
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,960
I should make a contingency plan.

498
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Hands out the world map.

499
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Yep.

500
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Well, we already know that he succeeds because the Southlands become Mordor.

501
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Well, yeah, that's kind of the problem.

502
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,960
And in that case, it is on the border of goddamn Run and Kandahan, etc.

503
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,960
Like, Kandahar.

504
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
Khan.

505
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Khan?

506
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Kar.

507
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,960
What's the name of the Eastern Kingdom?

508
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Wasn't after the war, though, didn't a bunch of people settle there from different regions that fought alongside the elves?

509
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Or no?

510
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
Not that far, I think.

511
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,960
Like, that's well beyond the original borders of Gondor.

512
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,960
No, Gondor actually occasionally occupied a fair portion of Mordor.

513
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,960
Yeah, but remember the Black Gate was their fortress.

514
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
I don't think they'd be that deep.

515
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Wait, why do the hobbits have pterodactyl suits?

516
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Why do they look like African tribals?

517
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,960
Because, Dev, it's their cultural heritage.

518
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960
Oh, they even do the dancy thing.

519
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
Yep.

520
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Imagine doing this for hours.

521
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Yeah.

522
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Like, it looks like it's supposed to be a celebration, but you have two lines.

523
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Like, at that point, it just sounds like indoctrination.

524
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Well, or an activist chant.

525
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Whose streets are streets?

526
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
You have carts.

527
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
Like, why is his ankle a problem?

528
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,960
This society isn't very intelligent.

529
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:16,960
The hobbit's gonna be like, okay, if you can't walk, we're not gonna carry you, we're not gonna put you in a stretcher or in a wagon, we're gonna leave your ass.

530
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Also, please push, take the goddamn nuts out of your hair, Jesus Christ, why?

531
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Oh, now, see, I've been at that point for a while where I see their hair and I'm like, that's just stupid.

532
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
What if...

533
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,960
Look, it's all camouflage, it makes sense in the lore, I think.

534
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,960
No, no, wait, what if they actually grow in their heads?

535
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Because they're forest spirits, so they have, like, branches growing out of their skulls.

536
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,960
I hate their hair so much.

537
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
She's independent.

538
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Actually, okay, from the back, you can kind of see the fake plastic stems.

539
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:01,960
I was almost enjoying myself there for a moment, but now, we're back here.

540
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
How many independent female characters, Barge?

541
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
You got a problem, Dan?

542
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Just annoying.

543
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
There.

544
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,960
What is she wearing?

545
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,960
I don't know, whatever shit she rolled in.

546
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,960
Can you even read? Is that common amongst the Harfoots?

547
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,960
The Harfoots have developed a written language, yet they still rely on images.

548
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,960
And also, they're writing in books, while the Numenoreans still have a bunch of scrolls.

549
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,960
That's a good point.

550
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,960
They have books too, but mostly sort of scrolls.

551
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,960
The Harfoots are more technologically advanced than the Numenoreans.

552
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Don't you like how quirky they are?

553
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,960
Love it.

554
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,960
You know, if I was ten, I would have really enjoyed that scene.

555
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
You would have?

556
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Yes.

557
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Really?

558
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,960
I can see it.

559
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,960
As a little kid, I never liked this sort of stuff.

560
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
But I guess that's the target audience.

561
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:13,960
You know, the raging fire and the alcohol somewhat undermines the whole camouflage idea of these people.

562
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Yep.

563
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
Yeah.

564
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,960
They're brightly lit encampments. They're stealthy.

565
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,960
Millions of fireflies they probably have to gather.

566
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,960
They have captured a lot of fireflies.

567
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Cultivate them.

568
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
They just have, like, firefly farms.

569
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
Yeah.

570
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,960
They likewise will be carried with us in our hearts and in our memories.

571
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,960
But their broken bodies will be left behind because we're savages like that.

572
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,960
We will just leave them to death.

573
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Oh hey, it's Sauron.

574
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,960
You mean Gandalf?

575
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,960
Nope, there's going to be, like, eighty Saurons.

576
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,960
I like that one.

577
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Gross.

578
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Actually, you know what they'll do?

579
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,960
They'll make this guy one of the two blue wizards that didn't really have a story.

580
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Oh, the blues.

581
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Yeah, but they arrived along with the rest of them.

582
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Like, they all arrived at the same time.

583
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,960
He's a wizard.

584
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
They're a wizard, Harry.

585
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,960
All the Harfoots are right there.

586
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,960
Yeah, but they're bees.

587
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,960
You got stung a lot, I guess.

588
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Oh, she'll notice.

589
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,960
They'll laugh because he got stunned to death.

590
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
I called that close.

591
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
Dude, you're burning!

592
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
He's like, oh, shoot.

593
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,960
I needed more light to see, okay?

594
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
I'm really nearsighted.

595
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:53,960
Now, don't mind me as I set fire to the entire encampment and, uh...

596
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,960
Oops.

597
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,960
Laugh track.

598
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Nori!

599
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Everyone's gonna turn their heads towards her.

600
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
And she's gonna get...

601
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
How dare you?

602
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,960
She's gonna get exiled.

603
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,960
It's gonna be like a Princess Mononoke thing where she's thrown out of the tribe, eh?

604
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
Oh, Shell, this gang.

605
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,960
They really will not wait for her.

606
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Oh, my God.

607
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Can we go back to the sea people already?

608
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
They're doing Frodo, guys.

609
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
Can you feel it?

610
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
It's Frodo.

611
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Femdo.

612
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Femdo?

613
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
I mean, blue wizard's dead.

614
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,960
That's actually just me looking at my monetization.

615
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,960
Hey, they're talking about the franchise.

616
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Are they?

617
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
Yeah, the past is dead.

618
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Oh, shoot, if you have to.

619
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
I didn't pick up on it.

620
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
It's too late.

621
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
It's too late in the evening.

622
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
That's quite the statue, Jesus.

623
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,960
Oh, they're just gonna do the Aragorn story again.

624
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,960
Literally just Sargon.

625
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,960
Just a few questions as to how Galadriel just walked into jail.

626
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Like, there's no guard stopping her.

627
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
She's just fine.

628
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,960
She's got the right to do this now.

629
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Listen, Arch, the Elfa Sea unlocks a lot of doors, okay?

630
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Ooh, maybe it will actually be Sauragorn.

631
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,960
And he'll be, like, mentally conflicted.

632
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Like, should I be Sauron?

633
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,960
It's like, I really like Galadriel, though, like a lot.

634
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,960
Yeah, Galadriel convinces him to become Sauron.

635
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Actually, you have to be king.

636
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,960
Do I? Yes, okay.

637
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,960
If that'll win you over, does it?

638
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,960
I don't want to be with you anymore.

639
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
What the fuck, woman?

640
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
You're evil now, Jesus.

641
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
Woman.

642
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
I'm trying to think about how impractical this is.

643
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,960
I try not to think about it, but I can't help it.

644
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Listen, it was basically built by gods, okay?

645
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,960
They've got skills.

646
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Fair enough.

647
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,960
I like some of the stats in Numenor, though, at least.

648
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Five sticks.

649
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
The scrolls thing is starting to annoy me, too,

650
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,960
because they've got ridiculously high-level architectural skills.

651
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
But scrolls.

652
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Yeah, scrolls are a bit more primitive.

653
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,960
I'm almost expecting them to have wax tablets.

654
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
Oh, not the hardwoods.

655
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
The stealthy cat-out hats.

656
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
I'd rather have the black elf, actually.

657
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
I love these things.

658
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
They're like, how do we make it stealthy?

659
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
We'll put, like, leaves on it.

660
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
Nobody will ever see it moving.

661
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Are you going to leave a trail for the brandy books?

662
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,960
Ah, yes, make the guy with the broken fucking legs pull the cart.

663
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Brilliant idea.

664
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,960
Maybe I'll have eggs with him.

665
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
Fuck it.

666
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,960
This time, get animals.

667
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Get a horse, man.

668
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Oh, it's a giant.

669
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
It's Sauron.

670
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,960
He's going to help him drag the cart.

671
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Me and him.

672
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Blueron.

673
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Like, use him as slave labor.

674
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Maybe more.

675
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,960
He's actually kind of cute and, like, lost puppy kind of way.

676
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Fucking lost giant puppy.

677
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,960
He's the only character of interest in this arc, in my opinion.

678
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Yeah.

679
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,960
They all are suspiciously white, aren't they?

680
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
And they're wearing white, too.

681
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,960
Oh, shit.

682
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,960
They would explain why they hate sunlight because they've got no melanin.

683
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Mm.

684
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,960
They're sizzling.

685
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,960
It burns very conveniently now.

686
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Not earlier, though.

687
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Have you considered using bows, maybe?

688
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
Oh.

689
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
No throwing weapons.

690
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
I mean, that works, too.

691
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
Ah, good old-fashioned tug-of-war.

692
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
They're just tug-of-warring.

693
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Fucking exhilarating.

694
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,960
Don't cut them down with your weapons or anything.

695
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
Let's pull them, Dorothy.

696
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Was that easy?

697
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
Oh, no!

698
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,960
So, did orcs always burn from sunlight?

699
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Uh, yes.

700
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,960
Okay.

701
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Except for the urakai.

702
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,960
Because Saruman's urakai are special.

703
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Right.

704
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
That's why they made a big deal about it.

705
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Wolfers.

706
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,960
It's a barge, but it looks dumb.

707
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Oh, god, it does look dumb.

708
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
It does look dumb, yes.

709
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
What the fuck is wrong with that?

710
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
What the fuck is with that thing?

711
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
That's some-

712
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Is this a hog-bog?

713
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Bog-bog.

714
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Attack.

715
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
Oh, Jesus.

716
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,960
It's like a chihuahua.

717
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,960
I do like how they just let her die, by the way.

718
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Oh, my god.

719
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
They're so fucking incompetent.

720
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
That's a killer.

721
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Oh, don't worry, black elf to the rescue.

722
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,960
Oh, I saw Legolas do this once.

723
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
Oh, my god.

724
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
That face.

725
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
That thing's face.

726
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
Forget about the chain.

727
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Just stab his ass.

728
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
Like so.

729
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
You stabbed him with a branch.

730
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
Oh, hey.

731
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Wouldn't it be cool if the other orcs had bows and arrows, too?

732
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,960
I didn't expect that.

733
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:55,960
Did they think there wouldn't just be guards up above the trenches?

734
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Now, why?

735
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Because he's the main character, Kyle.

736
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
You can't just kill him.

737
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
Fuck.

738
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Does it make sense for them not-

739
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,960
I mean, they killed everybody else, but not him.

740
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,960
Yes.

741
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,960
And now we need a reveal of Idar here.

742
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
And this is going to be Sauron.

743
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
They're all just Sauron.

744
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
No, no, no.

745
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
This is a red herring.

746
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Like, this is too obvious.

747
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Yeah, Idar's like a sub-commander or something like that.

748
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
Yeah.

749
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,960
He's an elf.

750
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
Yeah.

751
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,960
He's a motherfucking elf.

752
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Yeah, there's the way he's Sauron.

753
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,960
And there ends the episode.

754
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,960
He's a fucking elf.

755
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,960
Wow.

756
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Well, hold on.

757
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Didn't Sauron appear to the elves as a fellow elf, in fact?

758
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Kib, stop it, Kibs.

759
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Stop what?

760
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
The preview of episode four.

761
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Okay.

762
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
I stopped it just in time.

763
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
Okay, so yeah, that was episode three.

764
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
What did you all think?

765
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,960
I mean, it was better than one and two.

766
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
That's true.

767
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,960
That actually happened.

768
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,960
This is kind of the House of the Dragon problem as well, where you start in the middle of

769
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
the goddamn story.

770
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Like, episode one and two was practically pointless.

771
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,960
Very little was established other than introducing the characters, which could have been done

772
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
in an hour.

773
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Easy.

774
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
Yeah.

775
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
Now, finally, the ball is rolling.

776
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,960
And I mean, it's better because something is happening.

777
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
That's true.

778
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
Yes, I agree.

779
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
I like what they're doing with Halbrand.

780
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,960
He's the most interesting part of the show now, is Halbrand.

781
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
You know what's happening here?

782
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,960
You know what this show has turned into?

783
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,960
It's turned into a $5 billion production of Find Wally, as we were like, this is Sauron.

784
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
That's Sauron.

785
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Oh, wait.

786
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
Sauron.

787
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,960
What if the big twist by the end of the season is that all of these plotlines are happening

788
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,960
at different time periods and they're all Sauron?

789
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,960
That's what I was suggesting earlier.

790
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Like, I would not be surprised.

791
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,960
Like, in one of the other ones, the Southland's already fallen and they don't know it yet.

792
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Yep.

793
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,960
The thing is, like, I actually wouldn't mind that because if they managed to do it subtly,

794
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,960
it can actually be a rather clever twist.

795
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Like, oh, look, these are all my machinations, right?

796
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
You know?

797
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
I am Sauron.

798
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
I've done all of this.

799
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,960
But are they that clever, though?

800
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,960
No.

801
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,960
Well, I guess we will see.

802
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,960
We didn't get any Elrond this time.

803
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,960
No elrond, no dwarves.

804
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,960
Honestly, this is probably for the best.

805
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,960
The other episodes having all of the story arcs intermixed was a disaster in my opinion.

806
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Because it was just, and then then and then and then, and just like, and this group, and

807
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,960
then now this group is doing something.

808
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,960
Stuff actually happens when we actually focus an episode on only a couple arcs at a time.

809
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,960
It needed more focus, certainly.

810
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,960
So if the show slows itself down and gives like, okay, this episode is dedicated to these

811
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,960
two groups of characters rather than jumping around all the time.

812
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,960
The Hogwarts are still an incredibly unnecessary element.

813
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Yeah, the only interesting thing the Harfoots have going isn't the Harfoots.

814
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,960
It's the it's the dude, the big dude, tall dude.

815
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,960
It's Blueron.

816
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,960
It's just here's the thing, though, of the last time we did this, the most interesting

817
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,960
part of of that first video that we did was was Durin.

818
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
So it's kind of sad to see him again.

819
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
He'll get his own episode.

820
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Again, if they're going to slow it down and focus, then maybe we'll get more do it in

821
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:37,960
the next episode, because this this was Black Elf, Harfoots and Galadriel's arcs.

822
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,960
And nothing really happened with the Black Elf.

823
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,960
Like, OK, he's a slave and they had like a failed revolt to go.

824
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,960
See, the problem with the story line is it seems.

825
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
Yeah, right at the end.

826
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
Yeah, right at the end.

827
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
They just kind of hint it.

828
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
Yeah.

829
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,960
The Black Elf storyline hasn't done anything.

830
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,960
It's still at the exact same spot.

831
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Like, what reason do we have to give a shit about his adventures?

832
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,960
It shows the fate of the Southlands, what it's going to do.

833
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
That's my my theory.

834
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,960
And it's going to also show us Adar, whoever this guy is.

835
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,960
Well, that's true, I guess because Galadriel is talking about the Southlands.

836
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,960
Oh, that's what it is.

837
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
It's actually going to be Mordor in the future.

838
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,960
And his story arc takes place there.

839
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,960
So it's going to be more about the location, less about him.

840
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
That's the thing, though.

841
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,960
One of the brilliant things about Lord of the Rings was that it told you a lot of things

842
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
without explaining them in detail.

843
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,960
It made them mysterious.

844
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Like they were talking about, you know, dark things.

845
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,960
I don't know if we need to see the Southlands form.

846
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
Because otherwise it's not going to be Mordor.

847
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,960
Yeah, but wouldn't it be more interesting if the people of the Southlands just went quiet or something?

848
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,960
Instead of having this where it's a Black Elf going like,

849
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
Well, I'm here.

850
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,960
Entire garrisons of elves overrun instantly off screen.

851
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,960
Where they just like, they close the gates and then like all communication stops.

852
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
And then some of the fuck happened over there.

853
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
It's like a mystery.

854
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,960
But the issue is that I am not a fan of the elf garrison because that was the problem.

855
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,960
How the hell do you have this band of randos overtaking elf garrison?

856
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Well, you don't.

857
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
So you just don't.

858
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
We just don't show it.

859
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,960
But the problem is, is we should, in my opinion, story wise, we should see the Southlands fall and learn a little bit of how it falls.

860
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,960
But the execution is so bad that we're better off not seeing it because they did it so poorly.

861
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,960
Well, Kibbs, the execution is so bad we're better off not watching the show.

862
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
That's true.

863
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,960
Not seeing any of it at all.

864
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,960
Yeah, I don't know what else I have to say about it.

865
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,960
The first two episodes we could nitpick to shit because there was so much wrong with it.

866
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,960
But this one, it's like, oh, it's turned into like competent TV.

867
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,960
And it being competent means it's like, oh, well, it's there.

868
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
It's committing the cardinal sin.

869
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
It's no longer so bad.

870
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,960
It's good.

871
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
It's now it's just mediocre.

872
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,960
The issue is this is after two hours.

873
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:10,960
Like we are three hours into a TV show now and we have just finally been introduced to the scenario.

874
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,960
When it comes to the Lord of the Rings extended edition, that's like 12 hours of stuff you can watch.

875
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,960
At the three hour mark.

876
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,960
At the three hour mark.

877
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,960
Where are you?

878
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,960
You're basically at the part where they are.

879
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,960
They're they're exiting Moria.

880
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,960
Yes, that's what I thought to be.

881
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,960
It'd be around the exiting Moria and getting into Galadriel's realm.

882
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,960
A shit ton has happened at that point in the story.

883
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Yep, there's you could talk about it for hours.

884
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:44,960
Honestly, all the stuff that happened, all the nuances of what happened in Moria, all Frodo and them and the forming of the fellowship.

885
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:51,960
In this show, at the three hour mark, we've basically just left the Shire.

886
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,960
Yeah, this slow pacing hasn't benefited the show.

887
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:02,960
Like, I care no more about Black Elf now than I did three hours previously.

888
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
Yeah, honestly, we could cut out.

889
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:12,960
Honestly, episode one, A Shadow of the Past and episode two, Adrift, cut those two out and then skip to three.

890
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,960
There's so little.

891
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,960
Skip to three, slap on 10, 20 minutes of exposition.

892
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Like, have the elves, you know, they're having a happy day.

893
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
You know, they're just doing their shit.

894
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,960
Then the orcs sneak in, ambush them, drag them away.

895
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
I mean, skip the boat entirely.

896
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,960
Just have her be on Numenor.

897
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,960
On Numenor?

898
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,960
Yes, for some reason.

899
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,960
Because the entire part of that is just dumb.

900
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,960
Like, the swim home part is the stupidest thing I've seen in television in a long time.

901
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,960
You just start swimming off into the horizon and you're like, oh, okay.

902
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,960
That wasn't for plot armor.

903
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,960
She'd just be dead, dead, dead, immediate, no survival.

904
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,960
But then again, I mean, if Numenor is barred from the elves, how do you get her there?

905
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
Oh, you have to get there by circumstance.

906
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,960
How do you do that?

907
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,960
Oh, with the shipwreck.

908
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,960
How do you get her to her shipwreck?

909
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Well, the only time we know that the elves actually do any sort of sailing is when they're going off to their homeland.

910
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,960
So we've got to get her on one of those boats.

911
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,960
So how do we do that?

912
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
Oh, we've got to honor her somehow.

913
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,960
And then, like, you can follow their logic back, but it's all just contrived.

914
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,960
And the problem too is, the Numenor storyline has been so ridiculously special.

915
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:31,960
Like, the fall of Numenor is supposed to be the fall of Numenor.

916
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:36,960
It's supposed to be the slow corruption of the people against the Valar and against the elves.

917
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:46,960
But not only have we skipped that, we've gone past it to the point now that they have instituted an ethnostate that hates all non-Numenorians.

918
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:55,960
I mean, we're not even talking about the lore inconsistencies now, because you could get started there and never stop.

919
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,960
Don't be a racist, Arch.

920
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,960
Yeah.

921
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
This is just the story we're talking about here.

922
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,960
Like, this could be done a lot better.

923
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:14,960
And I feel like maybe they're resting on the idea that this is going to be a five-season thing and that this will be something epic and people won't mind the first two hours.

924
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:23,960
But at the same time, if the Fellowship of the Rings was just two hours of Frodo fucking about in the Shire, would anyone watch it?

925
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,960
I mean, I've watched that over this.

926
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,960
But not very much.

927
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,960
I'm guessing that they're trying to take, like, oh, we're in a TV show.

928
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,960
Let's just take the extra time we have.

929
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,960
But then they run into the risk of just boring people.

930
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:49,960
I guess I would rather there be more than too much than too little.

931
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,960
Are you sure about that, though?

932
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,960
Because you can definitely get too much.

933
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,960
Fair enough. I feel like we've been getting a bit much with the Harfoots.

934
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,960
Yeah.

935
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,960
Fucking Harfoots.

936
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,960
I'm not going to go away. That's the worst part.

937
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,960
Yeah.

938
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,960
Like, the Harfoots are just unbelievably uninteresting.

939
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,960
Like, they have no role in the story. They shouldn't be here.

940
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:19,960
The only reason they're there is because the showrunners were so blinded by the established thing that had gone before it.

941
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:25,960
They were like, we must have Harpets. We can't have Harpets. Harpets didn't exist. We must have Harpets.

942
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,960
Oh, they need to detach themselves from the fact that they have to be like the Lord of the Rings movies.

943
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,960
Because by doing that, they're shackling themselves to the idea that they're competing to be that thing that was so good.

944
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,960
And so they're already setting themselves up for failure.

945
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,960
Yet at the same time, though, they're not adopting any of the positive aspects of the movies.

946
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,960
Goodness.

947
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,960
Why does that thing exist?

948
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,960
That thing is in the uncanny valley. It's not scary. It's a dumb look.

949
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,960
That had some weird CG going on with it. Something wasn't right there.

950
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,960
They'll spend some extra hours in the bakery.

951
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,960
Yeah. I mean, I don't know what the heck they were thinking.

952
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:12,960
The Vargs from the Lord of the Rings, like, the original trilogy, yeah, they're like hyenas crossed with, like, some sort of horse thing.

953
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,960
But you know what? Whatever. It looks alright.

954
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:21,960
These things, or that thing, I don't know what the heck that was. It did not look right. It looked a little derpy.

955
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,960
Well, a pug barg.

956
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,960
It did look like a pug barg.

957
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,960
It had the balding eyes, too.

958
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,960
Man, it did not look healthy.

959
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:41,960
If you spend a billion dollars in the show, and you're gonna, you know, work a dozen VFX artists to death every single day to get it out, you gotta make it look better than that.

960
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,960
But obviously they didn't work enough VFX artists to death, Dev.

961
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,960
That's true. She's got a point.

962
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,960
We gotta sacrifice more South Koreans.

963
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:59,960
The city scenes themselves don't look half bad, but that Varg, oh, that was vain to look at.

964
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:07,960
Alright, it's 2am, and I gotta edit this before going to bed, and Arch, you're probably ready to collapse, so...

965
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,960
It's time, isn't it? It's time to wrap it up for today.

966
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,960
Fun and games. Fun and games.

967
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,960
So we'll be back again next week for more of this nonsense.

968
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,960
Thanks for being here, guys.

969
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,960
And thank you.

970
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,960
I wish I could say it was a pleasure.

971
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:34,960
But we're watching Lord of the Rings, the Rings of Power, so...

972
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,960
It is what it is.
