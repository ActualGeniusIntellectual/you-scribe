WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.220
Let's talk about the Blizzard boycott.

00:02.220 --> 00:05.660
If you haven't seen my previous video yet or don't know what's going on, please

00:05.660 --> 00:09.340
check out the most recent Dumping with Scrum because that provides a kicking off point

00:09.340 --> 00:10.340
for this one.

00:10.340 --> 00:14.900
Blizzard released the blog post titled Regarding Last Weekend's Hearthstone Grand Masters

00:14.900 --> 00:20.820
Tournament on Friday, October 11th at around 5.30pm at Blizzard's local time over on

00:20.820 --> 00:21.940
the west coast.

00:21.940 --> 00:26.060
This was after the offices had closed up for the week at Blizzard, and I personally think

00:26.060 --> 00:30.200
they released it at this time specifically so that the fallout would occur over the weekend

00:30.200 --> 00:33.900
when everyone was conceivably away from their desks, and they probably just planned to brush

00:33.900 --> 00:35.840
it all under the rug by Monday morning.

00:35.840 --> 00:40.920
My pal Jeremy over at The Quartering was doing an interview of Mark Kern, an original World

00:40.920 --> 00:43.440
of Warcraft developer, when this statement dropped.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.680
I'll leave a link in the description to that interview if you want to watch it, but

00:46.680 --> 00:51.060
Kern stated that back when he worked for Blizzard, if there was ever any really bad news that

00:51.060 --> 00:55.600
would not be received well and they knew it, they dropped it after hours on a Friday

00:55.600 --> 00:57.400
night, exactly as they've done here.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.640
It's a long statement, I'm not going to read it here, but I want to draw your attention

01:00.640 --> 01:01.800
to a few things.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.320
One is the length itself.

01:03.320 --> 01:07.560
The common consensus in the community is that it's this unnecessarily long so that your

01:07.560 --> 01:11.560
average reader will simply scroll down to the last page and gloss over the ending in

01:11.560 --> 01:13.400
order to see this passage.

01:13.400 --> 01:17.000
When we think about the suspension, 6 months for Blitzchung is more appropriate, after

01:17.000 --> 01:20.600
which time he can compete in the Hearthstone pro circuit again if he so chooses.

01:20.660 --> 01:24.500
And this is how Blizzard sees the issue, like it's a negotiation with another faction,

01:24.500 --> 01:28.420
their players, over what is an appropriate punishment for one of their esports competitors

01:28.420 --> 01:30.780
for bringing a political stance onto their platform.

01:30.780 --> 01:35.460
Viewing it like a negotiation, Blizzard's response is to, well, negotiate.

01:35.460 --> 01:39.740
They'll give Blitzchung's $10,000 back, cut his suspension in half, cut the suspension

01:39.740 --> 01:42.900
of the broadcasters down to 6 months as well, here guys, we'll give a little, you give

01:42.900 --> 01:45.040
a little, stop boycotting us, okay?

01:45.040 --> 01:47.900
But let's take another look at the original footage that started everything.

01:50.600 --> 02:01.100
I still have to ask why the original commentators

02:01.100 --> 02:02.580
were punished at all.

02:02.580 --> 02:06.020
They weren't involved in Blitzchung's decision, they saw the gas mask, figured out

02:06.020 --> 02:08.280
what was coming and hid their heads in embarrassment.

02:08.280 --> 02:13.380
In Blizzard's statement, they say casters help the esports viewing experience stay focused

02:13.380 --> 02:15.720
on the tournament and our amazing players.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.740
And remember that their purpose is to keep the event focused on the tournament.

02:18.740 --> 02:22.440
That didn't happen here, and we are setting their suspension to 6 months as well.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.480
Well, how could they have stopped Blitzchung?

02:24.480 --> 02:27.520
Do they look like they were in any position to do so on the fly?

02:27.520 --> 02:29.080
These guys shouldn't be punished at all.

02:29.080 --> 02:33.200
But like I said, the statement's long, and its length hides this section tucked away

02:33.200 --> 02:35.240
between the middle third's diatribes.

02:35.240 --> 02:39.400
The specific views expressed by Blitzchung were not a factor in the decision we made.

02:39.400 --> 02:43.880
I want to be clear, our relationships in China had no influence in our decision.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.960
We have these rules to keep the focus on the game and on the tournament to the benefit

02:46.960 --> 02:50.580
of a global audience, and that was the only consideration in the actions we took.

02:50.580 --> 02:52.660
And to this, I say BS.

02:52.660 --> 02:54.580
Absolute BS.

02:54.580 --> 02:58.780
And we know this, Blizzard, because when those Western Hearthstone pros held up the Free

02:58.780 --> 03:03.740
Hong Kong Boycott Blizzard sign during one of the Western tournaments, you refused to

03:03.740 --> 03:07.660
punish them, and in fact invited them back to the next round of games.

03:07.660 --> 03:11.740
If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we

03:11.740 --> 03:13.540
would have felt and acted the same.

03:13.540 --> 03:17.280
Why did the official Hearthstone account on Weibo send out a clear message of, we will

03:17.280 --> 03:21.800
respect the honor of China if you're supposed to be politically neutral, Blizzard?

03:21.800 --> 03:26.040
This is why the Blizzard Boycott has ramped up rather than faded away, because the lies

03:26.040 --> 03:28.200
are just so transparent.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.520
Blizzard is pissing on us and calling it rain.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.960
It's not just that, though.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.240
Allow me to read this Twitter thread by Bluebell.

03:34.240 --> 03:38.080
I have been keeping quiet out of fear, but as an English major and Chinese speaker, I

03:38.080 --> 03:40.680
feel like I really need to point this out since I don't know how many people will

03:40.680 --> 03:41.820
know enough to explain.

03:41.820 --> 03:45.840
The Blizzard post seems like it was written by a Chinese non-native English speaker.

03:45.840 --> 03:49.160
Before I go into this, I want to point out that the tone and language is all over the

03:49.160 --> 03:50.160
place.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.620
Some are more native English phrasings, others seem to be typical Chinese, which makes me

03:53.620 --> 03:56.000
think there's some cobbling together here.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.680
In Chinese, it's very common to use ellipses and space them out like this.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.640
This just doesn't happen in English.

04:01.640 --> 04:07.320
Unusually, this starts in the first person and uses casual contractions.

04:07.320 --> 04:11.180
Paragraphions don't exist in Chinese, so using them in formal situations is a common

04:11.180 --> 04:12.380
error.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.500
On the structuring.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.900
In Chinese, writing is difficult to add what an English teacher might call topic sentences

04:16.900 --> 04:18.900
at the beginning and end of paragraphs.

04:18.900 --> 04:22.020
This isn't conventional and sounds very heavy-handed in English.

04:22.020 --> 04:26.340
In the same vein, headers containing incomplete clauses are rhetorical questions before paragraphs

04:26.340 --> 04:28.940
are common in Chinese, but clunky in English.

04:28.940 --> 04:31.180
Also, why are the Blizzard parts indented?

04:31.180 --> 04:33.800
Doesn't it look like it was copy and pasted?

04:33.800 --> 04:38.580
This header, OK, makes it obvious that there are two voices here, whoever wrote this and

04:38.580 --> 04:40.480
whoever wrote the indented segment.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.540
Copy and pasting Blizzard official statements is even weirder.

04:43.540 --> 04:47.500
If there is an official Blizzard statement, why are we getting it in this wrapper?

04:47.500 --> 04:51.180
We then get to this long section where the grammatical indicators become apparent.

04:51.180 --> 04:55.540
Using when we think about instead of thinking or something else because think isn't really

04:55.540 --> 05:00.540
the best word here, it's too personal for a statement, is another Chinese sign.

05:00.540 --> 05:03.260
In Chinese, verbs don't take on different conjugations.

05:03.260 --> 05:08.000
So using when we think about, which is kind of awkward and unfitting in English, instead

05:08.000 --> 05:12.700
of looking back on or considering our, is a red flag.

05:12.700 --> 05:16.900
In the same vein, why with regard to instead of regarding?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.600
It's not wrong, just weird.

05:18.600 --> 05:23.600
Also, in Chinese, there are no plurals, no dogs or cats, only dog or cat.

05:23.600 --> 05:28.560
See, there is a consequence instead of the native English phrasing, there are consequences.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.680
So why is the statement like this?

05:30.680 --> 05:34.620
If it's not J. Allen Brack, the president of Blizzard, then who is it?

05:34.620 --> 05:36.660
Why a non-native English speaker?

05:36.660 --> 05:38.300
Why didn't PR edit this?

05:38.300 --> 05:39.460
What's going on?

05:39.460 --> 05:43.740
I'll add my own knowledge to this discussion, though it's definitely less than Blue Bells.

05:43.740 --> 05:47.380
I used to know some Chinese, although it's been a decade since I've used it and it's

05:47.380 --> 05:48.380
largely faded.

05:48.380 --> 05:51.400
I've dated two Chinese women and travelled to meet one of their families.

05:51.400 --> 05:55.700
And I have a number of friends in various Chinese immigrant social circles, from both

05:55.700 --> 06:00.680
Taiwan and China, including two roommates throughout several years of university.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.560
In my opinion, Blue Bells' analysis is spot on.

06:03.560 --> 06:07.120
This statement has a lot of the quirks that a native Chinese speaker writing in English

06:07.120 --> 06:09.040
as a second language would have.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.980
Nothing really grammatically incorrect, just odd, coupled with the fact that even though

06:12.980 --> 06:19.460
the announcement came out at 5.30pm on October 11th, it was actually dated for October 12th.

06:19.460 --> 06:21.400
And where was it October 12th at that time?

06:21.400 --> 06:22.840
Oh, in China.

06:22.840 --> 06:27.340
Not everyone thinks that this was, bizarrely, a message posted from China, or for the benefit

06:27.340 --> 06:30.780
of China, or with the help and encouragement of China.

06:30.780 --> 06:34.140
Theories are abound right now, but they all point to Blizzard choosing to kowtow to China

06:34.140 --> 06:35.140
for money.

06:35.140 --> 06:38.380
It seems like to me that this was a statement designed to wallpaper over the issue, and

06:38.380 --> 06:42.340
offer token concessions to the community because they don't actually intend to change.

06:42.340 --> 06:44.100
The Weibo post is still up.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.320
The Western protesters are still unpunished.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.460
This is Blizzard saying, fine, now take this and shut up.

06:49.460 --> 06:53.120
Naturally, the tweet delivering the statement has been ratioed into oblivion.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.480
I suspect that the majority of likes are coming from either Blizzard employees attempting

06:56.480 --> 07:00.440
to save their job, or radical leftist game journos who side with China because they're

07:00.440 --> 07:04.460
ardent believers in communism and that Western gamers were just entitled racists for thinking

07:04.460 --> 07:06.800
that Diablo Immortal looked like a flaming pile of garbage.

07:06.800 --> 07:11.320
On the plus side, Mei has actually become an IRL symbol of Hong Kong freedom, with all

07:11.320 --> 07:14.440
of that great fanart of her actually appearing in protests now.

07:14.440 --> 07:18.920
I do hope this makes Blizzard feel the pinch from their Chinese paymasters, either to censor

07:18.920 --> 07:21.660
the game or remove it entirely from the Chinese market.

07:21.660 --> 07:25.340
Apparently the new Mei figurine was pulled from the Blizzard merch store at around the

07:25.340 --> 07:29.340
same time as the first Mei leaflets were distributed on the ground in Hong Kong.

07:29.340 --> 07:33.300
Yeah, they were heavily pushing this thing for months, but where is it?

07:33.300 --> 07:34.300
It's gone.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.100
Boy, this tweet aged well.

07:36.100 --> 07:39.740
And as a quick aside, are those of you considering jumping ship to League of Legends as your

07:39.740 --> 07:42.980
new esports game of choice as a form of protest?

07:42.980 --> 07:44.300
Yeah, don't.

07:44.300 --> 07:48.180
Riot Games is 100% owned by China, and in regards to the upcoming events they've already

07:48.180 --> 07:49.720
preemptively censored everyone.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.960
It's moments like this that I'm happy to be a weeb.

07:51.960 --> 07:56.700
Japan, for all of its many faults, which I do not condone, at least has a cultural imperative

07:56.700 --> 08:00.560
to not bend over backward to avoid offending Chinese sensibilities.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.740
Unfortunately, for Blizzard, this whole situation isn't actually a negotiation between rival

08:04.740 --> 08:06.900
factions of equal power looking for a settlement.

08:06.900 --> 08:10.160
This is a consumer revolt and boycott of a corporation's products because of their

08:10.160 --> 08:11.160
bad behavior.

08:11.160 --> 08:15.440
Blizzard holds all of the power compared to average Joes like us, but at the same time,

08:15.440 --> 08:17.080
we spend our money where we like.

08:17.080 --> 08:21.100
It's not the same dynamic, and in this situation, their attempts to play the middle

08:21.100 --> 08:23.060
will only serve to alienate more people.

08:23.060 --> 08:25.540
Frankly, Blizzard's got a choice to make.

08:25.540 --> 08:26.540
China or the West.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.560
They can't have both markets anymore, and that's just that.

08:29.560 --> 08:32.660
In their statement they talk about being a global company and how they have to provide

08:32.660 --> 08:34.780
a product for many people with differing viewpoints.

08:34.780 --> 08:38.000
Well, we've finally come to a crossroads on that.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.940
There are two viewpoints that are mutually exclusive.

08:40.940 --> 08:45.340
One is the West's view, of free speech, equal rights under the law, and the consent

08:45.340 --> 08:46.600
of the governed.

08:46.620 --> 08:51.060
The other is China's view, of censorship, repression, and state force.

08:51.060 --> 08:53.440
You don't get to pander to both anymore, Blizzard.

08:53.440 --> 08:57.460
You know that China's attitude on this situation is my way or the highway, so you're

08:57.460 --> 09:02.500
instead trying to appeal to our liberal good graces by saying, listen, understand us guys,

09:02.500 --> 09:07.260
we're a global company, there's other people with different views, there's diversity.

09:07.260 --> 09:09.260
And frankly, we're tired of hearing it.

09:09.260 --> 09:12.620
No, Blizz, it's our way or the highway.

09:12.620 --> 09:17.400
Our spineless, middle ground fence sitting means you're with China and not with us.

09:17.400 --> 09:23.280
And I want as many people as possible to understand, when Blizzard, or Riot Games, or the NBA,

09:23.280 --> 09:28.560
or Apple, or anyone sides with China over us, this is what they're siding with.

09:28.560 --> 09:32.560
Chinese dissidents are being executed for their organs, hospital worker says.

09:32.560 --> 09:36.320
The prisoner was brought in, tied hand and foot, but very much alive.

09:36.320 --> 09:40.880
The army doctor in charge sliced him open from chest to belly button and exposed his

09:40.880 --> 09:42.080
two kidneys.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.940
Cut the veins and arteries, he told his shocked intern.

09:44.940 --> 09:46.660
The intern did as he was told.

09:46.660 --> 09:48.060
Blood spurted everywhere.

09:48.060 --> 09:50.860
The kidneys were placed in an organ transplant container.

09:50.860 --> 09:54.200
Then the doctor ordered the intern to remove the man's eyeballs.

09:54.200 --> 09:58.860
Hearing that, the dying prisoner gave him a look of sheer terror, and the intern froze.

09:58.860 --> 10:04.060
I can't do it, he told the doctor, who then quickly scooped out the man's eyeballs himself.

10:04.060 --> 10:08.860
Hong Kong's leader scraps talks with US Senator Ted Cruz because he refused to keep

10:08.860 --> 10:11.540
the content of those talks private.

10:11.540 --> 10:15.320
She seems to misunderstand how free speech operates, and also how freedom of the press

10:15.320 --> 10:20.160
operates, says Mr. Cruz, a Republican Senator from Texas, and a vocal critic of China who

10:20.160 --> 10:23.280
was stopping in Hong Kong for two days as part of a regional tour.

10:23.280 --> 10:27.080
Miss Lam's cancelling the meeting is not a sign of strength, it's a sign of weakness.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.320
It's a sign of fear of the protesters in the streets of Hong Kong.

10:30.320 --> 10:34.200
A 31 year old man allegedly jumped to his death on October 10th.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.640
I have censored the picture as it is extremely graphic.

10:36.640 --> 10:40.560
There's no trauma or blood consistent with the fall, but instead there's unusually

10:40.560 --> 10:46.220
placed bloodstains on his shirt, and his foot has been completely severed, lying several

10:46.220 --> 10:47.860
feet from his body.

10:47.860 --> 10:52.780
People on the ground in Hong Kong believe this man was executed by Hong Kong police,

10:52.780 --> 10:54.420
and left here to cover up his death.

10:54.420 --> 11:00.820
AI technology is being used in Hong Kong to face-track protesters for later capture, rape,

11:00.820 --> 11:02.300
and staged suicide.

11:02.300 --> 11:09.020
A Hong Kong taxi driver was paid 520,000 Hong Kong dollars to plow into protesters by a

11:09.020 --> 11:10.960
pro-Beijing advocacy group.

11:10.960 --> 11:15.680
The naked corpse of a 15 year old girl was found floating in the water just off Hong

11:15.680 --> 11:16.680
Kong.

11:16.680 --> 11:20.300
She was known to be a protester, and was arrested by the police on October 1st.

11:20.300 --> 11:23.740
The Hong Kong police burned her body before it could be examined.

11:23.740 --> 11:28.000
Another arrested protester states that sexual assault of female protesters that are arrested

11:28.000 --> 11:30.080
by the Hong Kong police is commonplace.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.620
I stated in my previous video that the West's moral cowardice in their dealings with China

11:33.620 --> 11:38.240
will go down in history as an equivalent shame, or worse, than Neville Chamberlain's appeasement

11:38.240 --> 11:40.500
of Nazi Germany before World War II.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.860
I stand by that statement.

11:42.860 --> 11:48.500
When we see the old 1930s German ads of American corporations proudly displaying Nazi symbols,

11:48.500 --> 11:53.500
like Coca-Cola or Ford or something, we think to ourselves, how could they do business with

11:53.500 --> 11:55.620
such obvious evil?

11:55.620 --> 12:00.860
And now, with Blizzard and Apple and the NBA, we know for ourselves, I will never buy the

12:00.860 --> 12:02.340
products of these companies again.

12:02.340 --> 12:06.200
I understand that I'm a small fry, that likely their business in China will continue regardless

12:06.200 --> 12:08.340
of anything that I or we do.

12:08.340 --> 12:12.640
But if this situation is truly outside of my control, and the only thing I can do about

12:12.640 --> 12:16.560
it is keep my own conscience in order, then that's what I'll do.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.340
It's better than doing nothing.

12:18.340 --> 12:21.660
So the next time Blizzard announces a new Overwatch character to be gay, the next time

12:21.660 --> 12:26.300
they have Pride sweatbands on during an esports event, the next time they try to rack up social

12:26.300 --> 12:30.660
goodwill for Pride Month or Black History Month or International Women's Day or whatever

12:30.660 --> 12:34.060
it is, recognize that you are being played.

12:34.280 --> 12:39.120
Tracer and Soldier 76 aren't actually gay in the Chinese localization of Overwatch.

12:39.120 --> 12:43.040
Blizzard still bans guilds from Warcraft with the word gay in their name.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.680
They still removed black characters from Diablo 3 in China.

12:46.680 --> 12:51.240
Blizzard naturally would reiterate their corporate line of think globally in response to these

12:51.240 --> 12:52.240
criticisms.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.840
That they're a global company that needs to market to many different people with many

12:55.840 --> 12:57.760
different ideas of what's acceptable.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.920
Okay, I'll bite.

12:59.920 --> 13:03.280
The reason that they use this logic on us is because they think we'll swallow anything

13:03.280 --> 13:04.500
in the name of diversity.

13:04.500 --> 13:09.660
The Chinese audience is just naturally bigoted against black people or LGBT people.

13:09.660 --> 13:13.560
But that's okay, because they're people of color themselves, don't you see?

13:13.560 --> 13:16.580
So their bigotry is acceptable because it comes from their culture.

13:16.580 --> 13:21.200
So we, as good little cosmopolitan citizens of the world, need to adapt our worldview

13:21.200 --> 13:22.540
to their sensibilities.

13:22.540 --> 13:25.040
Well, I say no.

13:25.040 --> 13:29.140
When you market to the entire world, you end up marketing to the lowest common denominator

13:29.140 --> 13:30.140
of the entire world.

13:30.140 --> 13:34.240
And we should be aiming to spread freedom, not appease tyrants in the name of cultural

13:34.240 --> 13:35.280
sensitivity.

13:35.280 --> 13:39.380
For all of the stories Blizzard writes about overthrowing authoritarian regimes and standing

13:39.380 --> 13:43.640
up for the downtrodden, you'd think that, by now, they would have learned not to bow

13:43.640 --> 13:47.240
down to one of the most repressive governments in human history.

13:47.240 --> 13:53.480
Well, Blizzard, our cultural sensibilities, the cultural sensibilities of the West, require

13:53.480 --> 13:56.320
that you no longer be a party to state oppression.
