0	2220	Let's talk about the Blizzard boycott.
2220	5660	If you haven't seen my previous video yet or don't know what's going on, please
5660	9340	check out the most recent Dumping with Scrum because that provides a kicking off point
9340	10340	for this one.
10340	14900	Blizzard released the blog post titled Regarding Last Weekend's Hearthstone Grand Masters
14900	20820	Tournament on Friday, October 11th at around 5.30pm at Blizzard's local time over on
20820	21940	the west coast.
21940	26060	This was after the offices had closed up for the week at Blizzard, and I personally think
26060	30200	they released it at this time specifically so that the fallout would occur over the weekend
30200	33900	when everyone was conceivably away from their desks, and they probably just planned to brush
33900	35840	it all under the rug by Monday morning.
35840	40920	My pal Jeremy over at The Quartering was doing an interview of Mark Kern, an original World
40920	43440	of Warcraft developer, when this statement dropped.
43440	46680	I'll leave a link in the description to that interview if you want to watch it, but
46680	51060	Kern stated that back when he worked for Blizzard, if there was ever any really bad news that
51060	55600	would not be received well and they knew it, they dropped it after hours on a Friday
55600	57400	night, exactly as they've done here.
57400	60640	It's a long statement, I'm not going to read it here, but I want to draw your attention
60640	61800	to a few things.
61800	63320	One is the length itself.
63320	67560	The common consensus in the community is that it's this unnecessarily long so that your
67560	71560	average reader will simply scroll down to the last page and gloss over the ending in
71560	73400	order to see this passage.
73400	77000	When we think about the suspension, 6 months for Blitzchung is more appropriate, after
77000	80600	which time he can compete in the Hearthstone pro circuit again if he so chooses.
80660	84500	And this is how Blizzard sees the issue, like it's a negotiation with another faction,
84500	88420	their players, over what is an appropriate punishment for one of their esports competitors
88420	90780	for bringing a political stance onto their platform.
90780	95460	Viewing it like a negotiation, Blizzard's response is to, well, negotiate.
95460	99740	They'll give Blitzchung's $10,000 back, cut his suspension in half, cut the suspension
99740	102900	of the broadcasters down to 6 months as well, here guys, we'll give a little, you give
102900	105040	a little, stop boycotting us, okay?
105040	107900	But let's take another look at the original footage that started everything.
110600	121100	I still have to ask why the original commentators
121100	122580	were punished at all.
122580	126020	They weren't involved in Blitzchung's decision, they saw the gas mask, figured out
126020	128280	what was coming and hid their heads in embarrassment.
128280	133380	In Blizzard's statement, they say casters help the esports viewing experience stay focused
133380	135720	on the tournament and our amazing players.
135720	138740	And remember that their purpose is to keep the event focused on the tournament.
138740	142440	That didn't happen here, and we are setting their suspension to 6 months as well.
142440	144480	Well, how could they have stopped Blitzchung?
144480	147520	Do they look like they were in any position to do so on the fly?
147520	149080	These guys shouldn't be punished at all.
149080	153200	But like I said, the statement's long, and its length hides this section tucked away
153200	155240	between the middle third's diatribes.
155240	159400	The specific views expressed by Blitzchung were not a factor in the decision we made.
159400	163880	I want to be clear, our relationships in China had no influence in our decision.
163880	166960	We have these rules to keep the focus on the game and on the tournament to the benefit
166960	170580	of a global audience, and that was the only consideration in the actions we took.
170580	172660	And to this, I say BS.
172660	174580	Absolute BS.
174580	178780	And we know this, Blizzard, because when those Western Hearthstone pros held up the Free
178780	183740	Hong Kong Boycott Blizzard sign during one of the Western tournaments, you refused to
183740	187660	punish them, and in fact invited them back to the next round of games.
187660	191740	If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we
191740	193540	would have felt and acted the same.
193540	197280	Why did the official Hearthstone account on Weibo send out a clear message of, we will
197280	201800	respect the honor of China if you're supposed to be politically neutral, Blizzard?
201800	206040	This is why the Blizzard Boycott has ramped up rather than faded away, because the lies
206040	208200	are just so transparent.
208200	210520	Blizzard is pissing on us and calling it rain.
210520	211960	It's not just that, though.
211960	214240	Allow me to read this Twitter thread by Bluebell.
214240	218080	I have been keeping quiet out of fear, but as an English major and Chinese speaker, I
218080	220680	feel like I really need to point this out since I don't know how many people will
220680	221820	know enough to explain.
221820	225840	The Blizzard post seems like it was written by a Chinese non-native English speaker.
225840	229160	Before I go into this, I want to point out that the tone and language is all over the
229160	230160	place.
230160	233620	Some are more native English phrasings, others seem to be typical Chinese, which makes me
233620	236000	think there's some cobbling together here.
236000	239680	In Chinese, it's very common to use ellipses and space them out like this.
239680	241640	This just doesn't happen in English.
241640	247320	Unusually, this starts in the first person and uses casual contractions.
247320	251180	Paragraphions don't exist in Chinese, so using them in formal situations is a common
251180	252380	error.
252380	253500	On the structuring.
253500	256900	In Chinese, writing is difficult to add what an English teacher might call topic sentences
256900	258900	at the beginning and end of paragraphs.
258900	262020	This isn't conventional and sounds very heavy-handed in English.
262020	266340	In the same vein, headers containing incomplete clauses are rhetorical questions before paragraphs
266340	268940	are common in Chinese, but clunky in English.
268940	271180	Also, why are the Blizzard parts indented?
271180	273800	Doesn't it look like it was copy and pasted?
273800	278580	This header, OK, makes it obvious that there are two voices here, whoever wrote this and
278580	280480	whoever wrote the indented segment.
280480	283540	Copy and pasting Blizzard official statements is even weirder.
283540	287500	If there is an official Blizzard statement, why are we getting it in this wrapper?
287500	291180	We then get to this long section where the grammatical indicators become apparent.
291180	295540	Using when we think about instead of thinking or something else because think isn't really
295540	300540	the best word here, it's too personal for a statement, is another Chinese sign.
300540	303260	In Chinese, verbs don't take on different conjugations.
303260	308000	So using when we think about, which is kind of awkward and unfitting in English, instead
308000	312700	of looking back on or considering our, is a red flag.
312700	316900	In the same vein, why with regard to instead of regarding?
316900	318600	It's not wrong, just weird.
318600	323600	Also, in Chinese, there are no plurals, no dogs or cats, only dog or cat.
323600	328560	See, there is a consequence instead of the native English phrasing, there are consequences.
328560	330680	So why is the statement like this?
330680	334620	If it's not J. Allen Brack, the president of Blizzard, then who is it?
334620	336660	Why a non-native English speaker?
336660	338300	Why didn't PR edit this?
338300	339460	What's going on?
339460	343740	I'll add my own knowledge to this discussion, though it's definitely less than Blue Bells.
343740	347380	I used to know some Chinese, although it's been a decade since I've used it and it's
347380	348380	largely faded.
348380	351400	I've dated two Chinese women and travelled to meet one of their families.
351400	355700	And I have a number of friends in various Chinese immigrant social circles, from both
355700	360680	Taiwan and China, including two roommates throughout several years of university.
360680	363560	In my opinion, Blue Bells' analysis is spot on.
363560	367120	This statement has a lot of the quirks that a native Chinese speaker writing in English
367120	369040	as a second language would have.
369040	372980	Nothing really grammatically incorrect, just odd, coupled with the fact that even though
372980	379460	the announcement came out at 5.30pm on October 11th, it was actually dated for October 12th.
379460	381400	And where was it October 12th at that time?
381400	382840	Oh, in China.
382840	387340	Not everyone thinks that this was, bizarrely, a message posted from China, or for the benefit
387340	390780	of China, or with the help and encouragement of China.
390780	394140	Theories are abound right now, but they all point to Blizzard choosing to kowtow to China
394140	395140	for money.
395140	398380	It seems like to me that this was a statement designed to wallpaper over the issue, and
398380	402340	offer token concessions to the community because they don't actually intend to change.
402340	404100	The Weibo post is still up.
404100	406320	The Western protesters are still unpunished.
406320	409460	This is Blizzard saying, fine, now take this and shut up.
409460	413120	Naturally, the tweet delivering the statement has been ratioed into oblivion.
413120	416480	I suspect that the majority of likes are coming from either Blizzard employees attempting
416480	420440	to save their job, or radical leftist game journos who side with China because they're
420440	424460	ardent believers in communism and that Western gamers were just entitled racists for thinking
424460	426800	that Diablo Immortal looked like a flaming pile of garbage.
426800	431320	On the plus side, Mei has actually become an IRL symbol of Hong Kong freedom, with all
431320	434440	of that great fanart of her actually appearing in protests now.
434440	438920	I do hope this makes Blizzard feel the pinch from their Chinese paymasters, either to censor
438920	441660	the game or remove it entirely from the Chinese market.
441660	445340	Apparently the new Mei figurine was pulled from the Blizzard merch store at around the
445340	449340	same time as the first Mei leaflets were distributed on the ground in Hong Kong.
449340	453300	Yeah, they were heavily pushing this thing for months, but where is it?
453300	454300	It's gone.
454300	456100	Boy, this tweet aged well.
456100	459740	And as a quick aside, are those of you considering jumping ship to League of Legends as your
459740	462980	new esports game of choice as a form of protest?
462980	464300	Yeah, don't.
464300	468180	Riot Games is 100% owned by China, and in regards to the upcoming events they've already
468180	469720	preemptively censored everyone.
469720	471960	It's moments like this that I'm happy to be a weeb.
471960	476700	Japan, for all of its many faults, which I do not condone, at least has a cultural imperative
476700	480560	to not bend over backward to avoid offending Chinese sensibilities.
480560	484740	Unfortunately, for Blizzard, this whole situation isn't actually a negotiation between rival
484740	486900	factions of equal power looking for a settlement.
486900	490160	This is a consumer revolt and boycott of a corporation's products because of their
490160	491160	bad behavior.
491160	495440	Blizzard holds all of the power compared to average Joes like us, but at the same time,
495440	497080	we spend our money where we like.
497080	501100	It's not the same dynamic, and in this situation, their attempts to play the middle
501100	503060	will only serve to alienate more people.
503060	505540	Frankly, Blizzard's got a choice to make.
505540	506540	China or the West.
506540	509560	They can't have both markets anymore, and that's just that.
509560	512660	In their statement they talk about being a global company and how they have to provide
512660	514780	a product for many people with differing viewpoints.
514780	518000	Well, we've finally come to a crossroads on that.
518000	520940	There are two viewpoints that are mutually exclusive.
520940	525340	One is the West's view, of free speech, equal rights under the law, and the consent
525340	526600	of the governed.
526620	531060	The other is China's view, of censorship, repression, and state force.
531060	533440	You don't get to pander to both anymore, Blizzard.
533440	537460	You know that China's attitude on this situation is my way or the highway, so you're
537460	542500	instead trying to appeal to our liberal good graces by saying, listen, understand us guys,
542500	547260	we're a global company, there's other people with different views, there's diversity.
547260	549260	And frankly, we're tired of hearing it.
549260	552620	No, Blizz, it's our way or the highway.
552620	557400	Our spineless, middle ground fence sitting means you're with China and not with us.
557400	563280	And I want as many people as possible to understand, when Blizzard, or Riot Games, or the NBA,
563280	568560	or Apple, or anyone sides with China over us, this is what they're siding with.
568560	572560	Chinese dissidents are being executed for their organs, hospital worker says.
572560	576320	The prisoner was brought in, tied hand and foot, but very much alive.
576320	580880	The army doctor in charge sliced him open from chest to belly button and exposed his
580880	582080	two kidneys.
582080	584940	Cut the veins and arteries, he told his shocked intern.
584940	586660	The intern did as he was told.
586660	588060	Blood spurted everywhere.
588060	590860	The kidneys were placed in an organ transplant container.
590860	594200	Then the doctor ordered the intern to remove the man's eyeballs.
594200	598860	Hearing that, the dying prisoner gave him a look of sheer terror, and the intern froze.
598860	604060	I can't do it, he told the doctor, who then quickly scooped out the man's eyeballs himself.
604060	608860	Hong Kong's leader scraps talks with US Senator Ted Cruz because he refused to keep
608860	611540	the content of those talks private.
611540	615320	She seems to misunderstand how free speech operates, and also how freedom of the press
615320	620160	operates, says Mr. Cruz, a Republican Senator from Texas, and a vocal critic of China who
620160	623280	was stopping in Hong Kong for two days as part of a regional tour.
623280	627080	Miss Lam's cancelling the meeting is not a sign of strength, it's a sign of weakness.
627080	630320	It's a sign of fear of the protesters in the streets of Hong Kong.
630320	634200	A 31 year old man allegedly jumped to his death on October 10th.
634200	636640	I have censored the picture as it is extremely graphic.
636640	640560	There's no trauma or blood consistent with the fall, but instead there's unusually
640560	646220	placed bloodstains on his shirt, and his foot has been completely severed, lying several
646220	647860	feet from his body.
647860	652780	People on the ground in Hong Kong believe this man was executed by Hong Kong police,
652780	654420	and left here to cover up his death.
654420	660820	AI technology is being used in Hong Kong to face-track protesters for later capture, rape,
660820	662300	and staged suicide.
662300	669020	A Hong Kong taxi driver was paid 520,000 Hong Kong dollars to plow into protesters by a
669020	670960	pro-Beijing advocacy group.
670960	675680	The naked corpse of a 15 year old girl was found floating in the water just off Hong
675680	676680	Kong.
676680	680300	She was known to be a protester, and was arrested by the police on October 1st.
680300	683740	The Hong Kong police burned her body before it could be examined.
683740	688000	Another arrested protester states that sexual assault of female protesters that are arrested
688000	690080	by the Hong Kong police is commonplace.
690080	693620	I stated in my previous video that the West's moral cowardice in their dealings with China
693620	698240	will go down in history as an equivalent shame, or worse, than Neville Chamberlain's appeasement
698240	700500	of Nazi Germany before World War II.
700500	702860	I stand by that statement.
702860	708500	When we see the old 1930s German ads of American corporations proudly displaying Nazi symbols,
708500	713500	like Coca-Cola or Ford or something, we think to ourselves, how could they do business with
713500	715620	such obvious evil?
715620	720860	And now, with Blizzard and Apple and the NBA, we know for ourselves, I will never buy the
720860	722340	products of these companies again.
722340	726200	I understand that I'm a small fry, that likely their business in China will continue regardless
726200	728340	of anything that I or we do.
728340	732640	But if this situation is truly outside of my control, and the only thing I can do about
732640	736560	it is keep my own conscience in order, then that's what I'll do.
736560	738340	It's better than doing nothing.
738340	741660	So the next time Blizzard announces a new Overwatch character to be gay, the next time
741660	746300	they have Pride sweatbands on during an esports event, the next time they try to rack up social
746300	750660	goodwill for Pride Month or Black History Month or International Women's Day or whatever
750660	754060	it is, recognize that you are being played.
754280	759120	Tracer and Soldier 76 aren't actually gay in the Chinese localization of Overwatch.
759120	763040	Blizzard still bans guilds from Warcraft with the word gay in their name.
763040	766680	They still removed black characters from Diablo 3 in China.
766680	771240	Blizzard naturally would reiterate their corporate line of think globally in response to these
771240	772240	criticisms.
772240	775840	That they're a global company that needs to market to many different people with many
775840	777760	different ideas of what's acceptable.
777760	779920	Okay, I'll bite.
779920	783280	The reason that they use this logic on us is because they think we'll swallow anything
783280	784500	in the name of diversity.
784500	789660	The Chinese audience is just naturally bigoted against black people or LGBT people.
789660	793560	But that's okay, because they're people of color themselves, don't you see?
793560	796580	So their bigotry is acceptable because it comes from their culture.
796580	801200	So we, as good little cosmopolitan citizens of the world, need to adapt our worldview
801200	802540	to their sensibilities.
802540	805040	Well, I say no.
805040	809140	When you market to the entire world, you end up marketing to the lowest common denominator
809140	810140	of the entire world.
810140	814240	And we should be aiming to spread freedom, not appease tyrants in the name of cultural
814240	815280	sensitivity.
815280	819380	For all of the stories Blizzard writes about overthrowing authoritarian regimes and standing
819380	823640	up for the downtrodden, you'd think that, by now, they would have learned not to bow
823640	827240	down to one of the most repressive governments in human history.
827240	833480	Well, Blizzard, our cultural sensibilities, the cultural sensibilities of the West, require
833480	836320	that you no longer be a party to state oppression.
