1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
Let's talk about the Blizzard boycott.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,660
If you haven't seen my previous video yet or don't know what's going on, please

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,340
check out the most recent Dumping with Scrum because that provides a kicking off point

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,340
for this one.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,900
Blizzard released the blog post titled Regarding Last Weekend's Hearthstone Grand Masters

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:20,820
Tournament on Friday, October 11th at around 5.30pm at Blizzard's local time over on

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,940
the west coast.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,060
This was after the offices had closed up for the week at Blizzard, and I personally think

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,200
they released it at this time specifically so that the fallout would occur over the weekend

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,900
when everyone was conceivably away from their desks, and they probably just planned to brush

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,840
it all under the rug by Monday morning.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,920
My pal Jeremy over at The Quartering was doing an interview of Mark Kern, an original World

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,440
of Warcraft developer, when this statement dropped.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,680
I'll leave a link in the description to that interview if you want to watch it, but

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,060
Kern stated that back when he worked for Blizzard, if there was ever any really bad news that

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,600
would not be received well and they knew it, they dropped it after hours on a Friday

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,400
night, exactly as they've done here.

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,640
It's a long statement, I'm not going to read it here, but I want to draw your attention

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,800
to a few things.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,320
One is the length itself.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,560
The common consensus in the community is that it's this unnecessarily long so that your

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,560
average reader will simply scroll down to the last page and gloss over the ending in

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,400
order to see this passage.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,000
When we think about the suspension, 6 months for Blitzchung is more appropriate, after

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,600
which time he can compete in the Hearthstone pro circuit again if he so chooses.

26
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,500
And this is how Blizzard sees the issue, like it's a negotiation with another faction,

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,420
their players, over what is an appropriate punishment for one of their esports competitors

28
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,780
for bringing a political stance onto their platform.

29
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,460
Viewing it like a negotiation, Blizzard's response is to, well, negotiate.

30
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,740
They'll give Blitzchung's $10,000 back, cut his suspension in half, cut the suspension

31
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,900
of the broadcasters down to 6 months as well, here guys, we'll give a little, you give

32
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,040
a little, stop boycotting us, okay?

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,900
But let's take another look at the original footage that started everything.

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:02:01,100
I still have to ask why the original commentators

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,580
were punished at all.

36
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,020
They weren't involved in Blitzchung's decision, they saw the gas mask, figured out

37
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,280
what was coming and hid their heads in embarrassment.

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,380
In Blizzard's statement, they say casters help the esports viewing experience stay focused

39
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,720
on the tournament and our amazing players.

40
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,740
And remember that their purpose is to keep the event focused on the tournament.

41
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,440
That didn't happen here, and we are setting their suspension to 6 months as well.

42
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,480
Well, how could they have stopped Blitzchung?

43
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,520
Do they look like they were in any position to do so on the fly?

44
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,080
These guys shouldn't be punished at all.

45
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,200
But like I said, the statement's long, and its length hides this section tucked away

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,240
between the middle third's diatribes.

47
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,400
The specific views expressed by Blitzchung were not a factor in the decision we made.

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,880
I want to be clear, our relationships in China had no influence in our decision.

49
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,960
We have these rules to keep the focus on the game and on the tournament to the benefit

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,580
of a global audience, and that was the only consideration in the actions we took.

51
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,660
And to this, I say BS.

52
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,580
Absolute BS.

53
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,780
And we know this, Blizzard, because when those Western Hearthstone pros held up the Free

54
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,740
Hong Kong Boycott Blizzard sign during one of the Western tournaments, you refused to

55
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,660
punish them, and in fact invited them back to the next round of games.

56
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,740
If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we

57
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,540
would have felt and acted the same.

58
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,280
Why did the official Hearthstone account on Weibo send out a clear message of, we will

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,800
respect the honor of China if you're supposed to be politically neutral, Blizzard?

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,040
This is why the Blizzard Boycott has ramped up rather than faded away, because the lies

61
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,200
are just so transparent.

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,520
Blizzard is pissing on us and calling it rain.

63
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,960
It's not just that, though.

64
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,240
Allow me to read this Twitter thread by Bluebell.

65
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,080
I have been keeping quiet out of fear, but as an English major and Chinese speaker, I

66
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,680
feel like I really need to point this out since I don't know how many people will

67
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,820
know enough to explain.

68
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,840
The Blizzard post seems like it was written by a Chinese non-native English speaker.

69
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,160
Before I go into this, I want to point out that the tone and language is all over the

70
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
place.

71
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,620
Some are more native English phrasings, others seem to be typical Chinese, which makes me

72
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,000
think there's some cobbling together here.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,680
In Chinese, it's very common to use ellipses and space them out like this.

74
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,640
This just doesn't happen in English.

75
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,320
Unusually, this starts in the first person and uses casual contractions.

76
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,180
Paragraphions don't exist in Chinese, so using them in formal situations is a common

77
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,380
error.

78
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,500
On the structuring.

79
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,900
In Chinese, writing is difficult to add what an English teacher might call topic sentences

80
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,900
at the beginning and end of paragraphs.

81
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,020
This isn't conventional and sounds very heavy-handed in English.

82
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,340
In the same vein, headers containing incomplete clauses are rhetorical questions before paragraphs

83
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,940
are common in Chinese, but clunky in English.

84
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,180
Also, why are the Blizzard parts indented?

85
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,800
Doesn't it look like it was copy and pasted?

86
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,580
This header, OK, makes it obvious that there are two voices here, whoever wrote this and

87
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,480
whoever wrote the indented segment.

88
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,540
Copy and pasting Blizzard official statements is even weirder.

89
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,500
If there is an official Blizzard statement, why are we getting it in this wrapper?

90
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,180
We then get to this long section where the grammatical indicators become apparent.

91
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,540
Using when we think about instead of thinking or something else because think isn't really

92
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:00,540
the best word here, it's too personal for a statement, is another Chinese sign.

93
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,260
In Chinese, verbs don't take on different conjugations.

94
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,000
So using when we think about, which is kind of awkward and unfitting in English, instead

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,700
of looking back on or considering our, is a red flag.

96
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,900
In the same vein, why with regard to instead of regarding?

97
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,600
It's not wrong, just weird.

98
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Also, in Chinese, there are no plurals, no dogs or cats, only dog or cat.

99
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,560
See, there is a consequence instead of the native English phrasing, there are consequences.

100
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,680
So why is the statement like this?

101
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,620
If it's not J. Allen Brack, the president of Blizzard, then who is it?

102
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,660
Why a non-native English speaker?

103
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,300
Why didn't PR edit this?

104
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,460
What's going on?

105
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,740
I'll add my own knowledge to this discussion, though it's definitely less than Blue Bells.

106
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,380
I used to know some Chinese, although it's been a decade since I've used it and it's

107
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,380
largely faded.

108
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,400
I've dated two Chinese women and travelled to meet one of their families.

109
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,700
And I have a number of friends in various Chinese immigrant social circles, from both

110
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,680
Taiwan and China, including two roommates throughout several years of university.

111
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,560
In my opinion, Blue Bells' analysis is spot on.

112
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,120
This statement has a lot of the quirks that a native Chinese speaker writing in English

113
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,040
as a second language would have.

114
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,980
Nothing really grammatically incorrect, just odd, coupled with the fact that even though

115
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:19,460
the announcement came out at 5.30pm on October 11th, it was actually dated for October 12th.

116
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,400
And where was it October 12th at that time?

117
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,840
Oh, in China.

118
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,340
Not everyone thinks that this was, bizarrely, a message posted from China, or for the benefit

119
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:30,780
of China, or with the help and encouragement of China.

120
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,140
Theories are abound right now, but they all point to Blizzard choosing to kowtow to China

121
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,140
for money.

122
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,380
It seems like to me that this was a statement designed to wallpaper over the issue, and

123
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,340
offer token concessions to the community because they don't actually intend to change.

124
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,100
The Weibo post is still up.

125
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,320
The Western protesters are still unpunished.

126
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,460
This is Blizzard saying, fine, now take this and shut up.

127
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,120
Naturally, the tweet delivering the statement has been ratioed into oblivion.

128
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,480
I suspect that the majority of likes are coming from either Blizzard employees attempting

129
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,440
to save their job, or radical leftist game journos who side with China because they're

130
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,460
ardent believers in communism and that Western gamers were just entitled racists for thinking

131
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,800
that Diablo Immortal looked like a flaming pile of garbage.

132
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,320
On the plus side, Mei has actually become an IRL symbol of Hong Kong freedom, with all

133
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,440
of that great fanart of her actually appearing in protests now.

134
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,920
I do hope this makes Blizzard feel the pinch from their Chinese paymasters, either to censor

135
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,660
the game or remove it entirely from the Chinese market.

136
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,340
Apparently the new Mei figurine was pulled from the Blizzard merch store at around the

137
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,340
same time as the first Mei leaflets were distributed on the ground in Hong Kong.

138
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,300
Yeah, they were heavily pushing this thing for months, but where is it?

139
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,300
It's gone.

140
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,100
Boy, this tweet aged well.

141
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,740
And as a quick aside, are those of you considering jumping ship to League of Legends as your

142
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,980
new esports game of choice as a form of protest?

143
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,300
Yeah, don't.

144
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,180
Riot Games is 100% owned by China, and in regards to the upcoming events they've already

145
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,720
preemptively censored everyone.

146
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,960
It's moments like this that I'm happy to be a weeb.

147
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,700
Japan, for all of its many faults, which I do not condone, at least has a cultural imperative

148
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,560
to not bend over backward to avoid offending Chinese sensibilities.

149
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,740
Unfortunately, for Blizzard, this whole situation isn't actually a negotiation between rival

150
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,900
factions of equal power looking for a settlement.

151
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,160
This is a consumer revolt and boycott of a corporation's products because of their

152
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
bad behavior.

153
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,440
Blizzard holds all of the power compared to average Joes like us, but at the same time,

154
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,080
we spend our money where we like.

155
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,100
It's not the same dynamic, and in this situation, their attempts to play the middle

156
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,060
will only serve to alienate more people.

157
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,540
Frankly, Blizzard's got a choice to make.

158
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,540
China or the West.

159
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,560
They can't have both markets anymore, and that's just that.

160
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,660
In their statement they talk about being a global company and how they have to provide

161
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,780
a product for many people with differing viewpoints.

162
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, we've finally come to a crossroads on that.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,940
There are two viewpoints that are mutually exclusive.

164
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,340
One is the West's view, of free speech, equal rights under the law, and the consent

165
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,600
of the governed.

166
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,060
The other is China's view, of censorship, repression, and state force.

167
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,440
You don't get to pander to both anymore, Blizzard.

168
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,460
You know that China's attitude on this situation is my way or the highway, so you're

169
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,500
instead trying to appeal to our liberal good graces by saying, listen, understand us guys,

170
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,260
we're a global company, there's other people with different views, there's diversity.

171
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,260
And frankly, we're tired of hearing it.

172
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,620
No, Blizz, it's our way or the highway.

173
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,400
Our spineless, middle ground fence sitting means you're with China and not with us.

174
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,280
And I want as many people as possible to understand, when Blizzard, or Riot Games, or the NBA,

175
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,560
or Apple, or anyone sides with China over us, this is what they're siding with.

176
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Chinese dissidents are being executed for their organs, hospital worker says.

177
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,320
The prisoner was brought in, tied hand and foot, but very much alive.

178
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,880
The army doctor in charge sliced him open from chest to belly button and exposed his

179
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
two kidneys.

180
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,940
Cut the veins and arteries, he told his shocked intern.

181
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,660
The intern did as he was told.

182
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,060
Blood spurted everywhere.

183
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,860
The kidneys were placed in an organ transplant container.

184
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,200
Then the doctor ordered the intern to remove the man's eyeballs.

185
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,860
Hearing that, the dying prisoner gave him a look of sheer terror, and the intern froze.

186
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,060
I can't do it, he told the doctor, who then quickly scooped out the man's eyeballs himself.

187
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,860
Hong Kong's leader scraps talks with US Senator Ted Cruz because he refused to keep

188
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,540
the content of those talks private.

189
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,320
She seems to misunderstand how free speech operates, and also how freedom of the press

190
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,160
operates, says Mr. Cruz, a Republican Senator from Texas, and a vocal critic of China who

191
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,280
was stopping in Hong Kong for two days as part of a regional tour.

192
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,080
Miss Lam's cancelling the meeting is not a sign of strength, it's a sign of weakness.

193
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,320
It's a sign of fear of the protesters in the streets of Hong Kong.

194
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,200
A 31 year old man allegedly jumped to his death on October 10th.

195
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,640
I have censored the picture as it is extremely graphic.

196
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,560
There's no trauma or blood consistent with the fall, but instead there's unusually

197
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,220
placed bloodstains on his shirt, and his foot has been completely severed, lying several

198
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,860
feet from his body.

199
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,780
People on the ground in Hong Kong believe this man was executed by Hong Kong police,

200
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,420
and left here to cover up his death.

201
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,820
AI technology is being used in Hong Kong to face-track protesters for later capture, rape,

202
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,300
and staged suicide.

203
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:09,020
A Hong Kong taxi driver was paid 520,000 Hong Kong dollars to plow into protesters by a

204
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,960
pro-Beijing advocacy group.

205
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,680
The naked corpse of a 15 year old girl was found floating in the water just off Hong

206
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
Kong.

207
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,300
She was known to be a protester, and was arrested by the police on October 1st.

208
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,740
The Hong Kong police burned her body before it could be examined.

209
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,000
Another arrested protester states that sexual assault of female protesters that are arrested

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,080
by the Hong Kong police is commonplace.

211
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,620
I stated in my previous video that the West's moral cowardice in their dealings with China

212
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,240
will go down in history as an equivalent shame, or worse, than Neville Chamberlain's appeasement

213
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,500
of Nazi Germany before World War II.

214
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,860
I stand by that statement.

215
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,500
When we see the old 1930s German ads of American corporations proudly displaying Nazi symbols,

216
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,500
like Coca-Cola or Ford or something, we think to ourselves, how could they do business with

217
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,620
such obvious evil?

218
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,860
And now, with Blizzard and Apple and the NBA, we know for ourselves, I will never buy the

219
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,340
products of these companies again.

220
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,200
I understand that I'm a small fry, that likely their business in China will continue regardless

221
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,340
of anything that I or we do.

222
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,640
But if this situation is truly outside of my control, and the only thing I can do about

223
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,560
it is keep my own conscience in order, then that's what I'll do.

224
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,340
It's better than doing nothing.

225
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,660
So the next time Blizzard announces a new Overwatch character to be gay, the next time

226
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,300
they have Pride sweatbands on during an esports event, the next time they try to rack up social

227
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,660
goodwill for Pride Month or Black History Month or International Women's Day or whatever

228
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,060
it is, recognize that you are being played.

229
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,120
Tracer and Soldier 76 aren't actually gay in the Chinese localization of Overwatch.

230
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,040
Blizzard still bans guilds from Warcraft with the word gay in their name.

231
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,680
They still removed black characters from Diablo 3 in China.

232
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,240
Blizzard naturally would reiterate their corporate line of think globally in response to these

233
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
criticisms.

234
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,840
That they're a global company that needs to market to many different people with many

235
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,760
different ideas of what's acceptable.

236
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,920
Okay, I'll bite.

237
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,280
The reason that they use this logic on us is because they think we'll swallow anything

238
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,500
in the name of diversity.

239
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,660
The Chinese audience is just naturally bigoted against black people or LGBT people.

240
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,560
But that's okay, because they're people of color themselves, don't you see?

241
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,580
So their bigotry is acceptable because it comes from their culture.

242
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,200
So we, as good little cosmopolitan citizens of the world, need to adapt our worldview

243
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,540
to their sensibilities.

244
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,040
Well, I say no.

245
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,140
When you market to the entire world, you end up marketing to the lowest common denominator

246
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,140
of the entire world.

247
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,240
And we should be aiming to spread freedom, not appease tyrants in the name of cultural

248
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,280
sensitivity.

249
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,380
For all of the stories Blizzard writes about overthrowing authoritarian regimes and standing

250
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,640
up for the downtrodden, you'd think that, by now, they would have learned not to bow

251
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,240
down to one of the most repressive governments in human history.

252
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,480
Well, Blizzard, our cultural sensibilities, the cultural sensibilities of the West, require

253
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,320
that you no longer be a party to state oppression.
