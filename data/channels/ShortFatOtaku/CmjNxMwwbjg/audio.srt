00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,300
A lot of England is coming out of the lockdown into a worse condition than when they went into it

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,000
from the perspective of, say, personal liberty.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,500
It's mad. I thought we had a lockdown to stop this virus, and then we had another lockdown to stop this virus.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,700
And now we're going into a worse lockdown, like, semi-lockdown than before?

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:26,000
It's like, okay, I think if there's one thing we've worked out after a year of having to deal with this virus now,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
is that lockdowns aren't the solution. They don't fix it. They don't fix it.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,500
Don't know what to tell you, didn't work, and now we're stuck with a bunch of really pressing concerns

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,500
about how we seem to be in a fascist state, and I kind of hate it.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,000
I kind of hate knowing that the government can just be like, fuck you, and I've got no particular recourse.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It obviously is not a modern legal document, right? But that's not what we're talking about.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,500
When someone says, oh, I've got the authority of the Magna Carta behind me,

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:03,000
what they are saying is that as a free man in England, and that's a specific term,

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that's not me saying a free male, that's a free man, is a particular category that we all fall into now.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If you're not an aristocrat, you're a free man, you're a yeoman.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's the spirit of the thing. It is that the governing authority will not have unlimited power

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to arbitrarily treat the subjects beneath it without their consent.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's the essence, the kernel and the spirit, the will behind constitutionalism right there.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's where it begins. That's where the English tradition of it begins.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And this is important. This is why we have human rights now.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's Anglo-Saxons in the woods, as Robert Conquest described it, right?

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Where they're figuring out how they should be governed.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And they realize actually we can govern ourselves and should govern ourselves.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And in fact, giving the king unaccountable, which we'll call arbitrary,

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
when people say arbitrary, they don't actually mean without reason when talking about this, they mean unaccountable.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So arbitrary power of the king. So the king, you could just wake up that morning and go,

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
you know, I'm just gonna take everyone's land. Fuck you. You can't do anything about it.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've had the authority. I'm the king.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, it's the same with the state. And it's any relationship between the individual and the state falls into that category.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Whether you are a baron in 1215 or you are an English tattoo artist in 2020 or a salon owner in 2020,

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
it's the same principle that applies. It's exactly the same. And it means exactly the same thing.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I didn't deserve this because they don't deserve this. And the government therefore should not have the power to do it.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The government should have limits. And this is the essence of it. This is the spirit of the thing.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's deeply shameful. All of England should be in revolt against this.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And just carrying on their lives. Just carry on as you choose.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Because fundamentally the government can say whatever they like, and I'm sure they can send their stormtroopers in to enforce it.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But at the end of the day, they don't have the right. They just don't have the right to do it.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I mean, everyone could divest from these people and be like, no, I'm not going to that tattoo shop.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm not going to that salon. I might catch the coof. I'm not going in there. I'm fine.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's fine. You do that. You know, that is your goddamn choice.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I totally respect your authority in making that choice in your autonomy.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You should be able to make that choice. You don't have to go in their tattoo shops,

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
but you also don't get to tell them they can't fucking run them.
