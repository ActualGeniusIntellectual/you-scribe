0	6300	A lot of England is coming out of the lockdown into a worse condition than when they went into it
6300	9000	from the perspective of, say, personal liberty.
9000	14500	It's mad. I thought we had a lockdown to stop this virus, and then we had another lockdown to stop this virus.
14500	19700	And now we're going into a worse lockdown, like, semi-lockdown than before?
19700	26000	It's like, okay, I think if there's one thing we've worked out after a year of having to deal with this virus now,
26000	30000	is that lockdowns aren't the solution. They don't fix it. They don't fix it.
30000	36500	Don't know what to tell you, didn't work, and now we're stuck with a bunch of really pressing concerns
36500	40500	about how we seem to be in a fascist state, and I kind of hate it.
40500	47000	I kind of hate knowing that the government can just be like, fuck you, and I've got no particular recourse.
47000	52000	It obviously is not a modern legal document, right? But that's not what we're talking about.
52000	56500	When someone says, oh, I've got the authority of the Magna Carta behind me,
56500	63000	what they are saying is that as a free man in England, and that's a specific term,
63000	73000	that's not me saying a free male, that's a free man, is a particular category that we all fall into now.
73000	76000	If you're not an aristocrat, you're a free man, you're a yeoman.
76000	84000	It's the spirit of the thing. It is that the governing authority will not have unlimited power
84000	90000	to arbitrarily treat the subjects beneath it without their consent.
90000	101000	That's the essence, the kernel and the spirit, the will behind constitutionalism right there.
101000	105000	That's where it begins. That's where the English tradition of it begins.
105000	110000	And this is important. This is why we have human rights now.
110000	115000	It's Anglo-Saxons in the woods, as Robert Conquest described it, right?
115000	117000	Where they're figuring out how they should be governed.
117000	121000	And they realize actually we can govern ourselves and should govern ourselves.
121000	127000	And in fact, giving the king unaccountable, which we'll call arbitrary,
127000	131000	when people say arbitrary, they don't actually mean without reason when talking about this, they mean unaccountable.
131000	135000	So arbitrary power of the king. So the king, you could just wake up that morning and go,
135000	138000	you know, I'm just gonna take everyone's land. Fuck you. You can't do anything about it.
138000	139000	I've had the authority. I'm the king.
139000	146000	Well, it's the same with the state. And it's any relationship between the individual and the state falls into that category.
146000	155000	Whether you are a baron in 1215 or you are an English tattoo artist in 2020 or a salon owner in 2020,
155000	160000	it's the same principle that applies. It's exactly the same. And it means exactly the same thing.
160000	167000	I didn't deserve this because they don't deserve this. And the government therefore should not have the power to do it.
167000	173000	The government should have limits. And this is the essence of it. This is the spirit of the thing.
173000	177000	It's deeply shameful. All of England should be in revolt against this.
177000	182000	And just carrying on their lives. Just carry on as you choose.
182000	188000	Because fundamentally the government can say whatever they like, and I'm sure they can send their stormtroopers in to enforce it.
188000	193000	But at the end of the day, they don't have the right. They just don't have the right to do it.
193000	197000	I mean, everyone could divest from these people and be like, no, I'm not going to that tattoo shop.
197000	203000	I'm not going to that salon. I might catch the coof. I'm not going in there. I'm fine.
203000	207000	That's fine. You do that. You know, that is your goddamn choice.
207000	211000	I totally respect your authority in making that choice in your autonomy.
211000	215000	You should be able to make that choice. You don't have to go in their tattoo shops,
215000	218000	but you also don't get to tell them they can't fucking run them.
