A lot of England is coming out of the lockdown into a worse condition than when they went into it

00:06.300 --> 00:09.000
from the perspective of, say, personal liberty.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.500
It's mad. I thought we had a lockdown to stop this virus, and then we had another lockdown to stop this virus.

00:14.500 --> 00:19.700
And now we're going into a worse lockdown, like, semi-lockdown than before?

00:19.700 --> 00:26.000
It's like, okay, I think if there's one thing we've worked out after a year of having to deal with this virus now,

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
is that lockdowns aren't the solution. They don't fix it. They don't fix it.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.500
Don't know what to tell you, didn't work, and now we're stuck with a bunch of really pressing concerns

00:36.500 --> 00:40.500
about how we seem to be in a fascist state, and I kind of hate it.

00:40.500 --> 00:47.000
I kind of hate knowing that the government can just be like, fuck you, and I've got no particular recourse.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
It obviously is not a modern legal document, right? But that's not what we're talking about.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.500
When someone says, oh, I've got the authority of the Magna Carta behind me,

00:56.500 --> 01:03.000
what they are saying is that as a free man in England, and that's a specific term,

01:03.000 --> 01:13.000
that's not me saying a free male, that's a free man, is a particular category that we all fall into now.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
If you're not an aristocrat, you're a free man, you're a yeoman.

01:16.000 --> 01:24.000
It's the spirit of the thing. It is that the governing authority will not have unlimited power

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
to arbitrarily treat the subjects beneath it without their consent.

01:30.000 --> 01:41.000
That's the essence, the kernel and the spirit, the will behind constitutionalism right there.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
That's where it begins. That's where the English tradition of it begins.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
And this is important. This is why we have human rights now.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
It's Anglo-Saxons in the woods, as Robert Conquest described it, right?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Where they're figuring out how they should be governed.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
And they realize actually we can govern ourselves and should govern ourselves.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
And in fact, giving the king unaccountable, which we'll call arbitrary,

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
when people say arbitrary, they don't actually mean without reason when talking about this, they mean unaccountable.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
So arbitrary power of the king. So the king, you could just wake up that morning and go,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
you know, I'm just gonna take everyone's land. Fuck you. You can't do anything about it.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
I've had the authority. I'm the king.

02:19.000 --> 02:26.000
Well, it's the same with the state. And it's any relationship between the individual and the state falls into that category.

02:26.000 --> 02:35.000
Whether you are a baron in 1215 or you are an English tattoo artist in 2020 or a salon owner in 2020,

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
it's the same principle that applies. It's exactly the same. And it means exactly the same thing.

02:40.000 --> 02:47.000
I didn't deserve this because they don't deserve this. And the government therefore should not have the power to do it.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
The government should have limits. And this is the essence of it. This is the spirit of the thing.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
It's deeply shameful. All of England should be in revolt against this.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
And just carrying on their lives. Just carry on as you choose.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
Because fundamentally the government can say whatever they like, and I'm sure they can send their stormtroopers in to enforce it.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
But at the end of the day, they don't have the right. They just don't have the right to do it.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
I mean, everyone could divest from these people and be like, no, I'm not going to that tattoo shop.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
I'm not going to that salon. I might catch the coof. I'm not going in there. I'm fine.

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
That's fine. You do that. You know, that is your goddamn choice.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
I totally respect your authority in making that choice in your autonomy.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
You should be able to make that choice. You don't have to go in their tattoo shops,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
but you also don't get to tell them they can't fucking run them.
