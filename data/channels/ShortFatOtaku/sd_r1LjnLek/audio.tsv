0	9480	So, recently, Demi Lovato came out as non-binary.
9480	13440	For those of you who don't know what non-binary is, the Wikipedia definition will suffice
13440	15160	for this discussion.
15160	18540	Non-binary or genderqueer is an umbrella term for gender identities that are neither male
18540	20160	nor female.
20160	24420	Non-binary identities fall under the transgender umbrella since non-binary people typically
24420	27880	identify with a gender that is different from their assigned sex.
27880	31960	Non-binary people may identify as having two or more genders, having no gender, moving
31960	37180	between genders, or having a fluctuating gender identity, or being a third gender or other
37180	38180	gendered.
38180	39360	Conceptually, this kind of makes sense to me.
39360	42480	Forget about the possible biological arguments for a second, since I know people like to
42480	43480	bring those up.
43480	44680	With good reason, of course.
44680	49000	But set them aside for now, close your eyes, and consider things based on introspection.
49000	53880	Regarding transness, it is reasonable to conceive of a sense of self where it feels like what
53880	57240	gender you should be doesn't match what physical sex you are.
57240	60920	Rather, it matches the other physical sex that you see walking around in the world.
60920	65620	I've never experienced that, but from a purely self-referential internal thought experiment,
65620	69020	it certainly seems possible, and I can imagine what it would be like, roughly speaking.
69020	73440	If you can also imagine it in your own internal thought experiment, then consider this other
73440	78080	possibility, where it feels like what gender you should be doesn't match with what physical
78080	82560	sex you are, but it also doesn't match that other physical sex you see around either.
82560	86880	Rather, your sense of gender is something different, or it's non-existent, or it fluctuates
86920	89560	between the masculine and the feminine on a regular basis.
89560	94240	As an outsider looking in, that is what non-binary seems like it would feel like.
94240	98440	Again, makes sense to me, especially the possibility where your gender fluctuates between masculine
98440	99440	and feminine.
99440	102900	I've never had days where I really feel super feminine, but I've certainly had super
102900	107440	masculine feeling days, and almost agender feeling days throughout my life.
107440	110320	I simply chalk that up to natural hormone fluctuations over time.
110320	114320	In fact, I'd hazard a guess that it's probably a very common experience to view your gender
114320	119720	in this way, as being more or less impactful to your personality in some cyclical manner.
119720	123720	However, beyond just natural fluctuations, when I'm with a woman, or I'm lifting
123720	127840	weights, or I'm performing some kind of hard yet fulfilling physical labor, I certainly
127840	132780	feel more masculine, and I don't think that's just a consequence of socialization, I absolutely
132780	136160	think that the increased testosterone from those activities play a role.
136160	140360	Despite this ebb and flow of gender importance in my day to day life, I'd never actually
140360	142200	consider myself non-binary.
142200	146100	Even if I might actually fit the role under some very broad definitions.
146100	149900	Under those same broad definitions, it feels like almost everyone fits the role.
149900	154880	But now that Demi Lovato has said, my pronouns are they, them, I've noticed a shift in
154880	159960	the discourse, and in my opinion, it's properly described as the final stage of the commodification
159960	160960	of the trans identity.
160960	162760	Let me explain what I mean.
162760	165760	Progressives generally feel that media representation is very important.
165760	168000	I'm sure you've seen stuff like this before.
168000	172540	The BBC will have more gay characters in its shows to combat heteronormative culture.
172540	175080	Why Arab and Islamic representation matters.
175080	178840	LGBTQ series regulars on broadcast TV hit an all-time high.
178840	185040	In fact, the TV industry is urged to increase LGBTQ representation to 20%, despite the LGBT
185040	187840	population being at only around 4.5%.
187840	192040	I understand, on some level, the necessity of seeing at least a few people like you in
192040	193400	the media that you consume.
193400	196720	At this point, I'm sure we've all seen those interviews, where Whoopi Goldberg says
196720	200800	she was inspired by Nichelle Nichols on the original Star Trek, playing a role as a black
200800	204760	person who wasn't a villain or a servant, but was actually doing something important
204760	205760	on the Enterprise.
205760	209120	And a similar story, where Nichols wanted to leave the series but was convinced not
209120	212680	to do so by Martin Luther King Jr. for the exact same reasons.
212680	215600	Despite everything that was going on in the United States at the time, here was a black
215600	220080	woman in a position of importance in the future, a person of competence and intelligence, who
220080	224280	was showing the audiences of the day what black people could be, in an era of TV that
224280	225280	didn't really do that.
225360	230240	I also understand the artistic appeal of making race-bent or gender-bent variations of previously
230240	231640	existing properties.
231640	235620	Othello is a play about a Maghreb general in otherwise all Italian society, generally
235620	239360	played nowadays by a black actor among a white troupe, but there's certainly value in a
239360	243000	race-swapped portrayal, where Othello is white and everybody else is black.
243000	247000	Seeing Robin as a girl in The Dark Knight Returns was, similarly, a lot of fun, and
247000	251600	the story's more grotesque style translated into the character being rather ugly, but
251600	253240	in a specifically androgynous way.
253400	257040	That's not to say that androgyny is always ugly, obviously, but when it is ugly, it's
257040	258040	like this.
258040	260980	I don't even necessarily mind the stuff that makes historical figures different than
260980	264240	they were, if the point of the work isn't historical accuracy.
264240	267880	I think that's why people made fun of Battlefield V so relentlessly.
267880	271600	Not because it was putting disabled female soldiers of colour into World War II, but
271600	274840	because it was doing it and claiming it was an accurate portrayal of history.
274840	277680	If they had said, listen, we're just having fun here, I wouldn't have given it a second
277680	278680	thought.
278680	281920	This is all stuff that the progs are correct about on some level, but it also leads to
281920	284880	a pretty shitty end result that they've completely embraced.
284880	288960	If representation for the sake of representation becomes popular, it makes money.
288960	292840	And if it makes money, there will be somebody out there willing to do it not for the sake
292840	295500	of the representation, but for the sake of the money.
295500	299200	This is another one of those old man dev stories I tell on this channel a lot, but back when
299200	303320	I was a young leftist, the discourse revolved a lot around tokenism, the practice of making
303320	307920	a symbolic effort at inclusion, sometimes even a real effort at inclusion, not because
307920	312440	you value inclusivity as an end in itself, but because you value the money that inclusivity
312440	317080	brings, or inversely, you fear the loss of money that not being inclusive would bring.
317080	320580	Back in my day, a lot of the efforts that were moving towards inclusivity were derided
320580	323360	by leftists as being just tokenism.
323360	327600	It's my experience that you can often tell if something is actually soulless tokenism
327600	330360	if it doesn't represent reality in any way when you see it.
330360	334960	It's a big fat red flag when characters shoehorn the author's politics into conversations.
334960	338340	tokenism is when the new stewards of a property are completely unwilling to adhere to the
338340	342720	pre-established lore of that property in the name of representation, and also when the
342720	346080	discrimination that's alleged in the story doesn't really seem to actually exist in real
346080	347360	life all that much.
347360	352280	I mean sure, I can see how a girl might be teased for being too tall in school, but that's
352280	356340	simply because kids are shitty creatures and will tease you for anything, not because they
356340	358440	actually hate tallness.
358440	360640	I mean really guys?
360640	361640	Really?
362040	365920	Thus far we've only spoken about representation in fiction, which let's be honest doesn't
365920	370360	actually mean anything big picture, even taking the star trek example into account.
370360	373560	It's an entirely different set of problems when you begin to talk about representation
373560	377640	within technical fields, where the person's qualifications are the only variable that
377640	378760	matters.
378760	383060	Tokenism here is far more unjustifiable, because if it turns out that a specific group of people,
383060	387320	for whatever reason I'm not saying genetics, doesn't produce as many scientists for example,
387360	392240	Establishing hiring quotas or admittance quotas for schools causes serious problems.
392240	396440	You want the best people possible in these positions regardless of race or gender, but
396440	397480	not just that.
397480	401320	If let's say you admit a bunch of people who can't hack it to a difficult technical
401320	405520	program based on their race and they all drop out, you're artificially inflating the drop
405520	410120	out statistics for that race, creating the snowballing problem of over-investment into
410120	413960	a group, spawning the very conditions that require the investment.
413960	416120	And of course, nobody ever sees it the other way around.
416120	420240	For example, trans women are drastically overrepresented in the field of computer programming,
420240	423480	but nobody wants to limit their participation in that field, and it wouldn't be a good idea
423480	426080	to do so, because skill should be the name of the game.
426080	430720	And despite all of this, leftists nowadays have completely leaned into tokenism, to the
430720	435800	point that progress now means rejecting colorblindness rather than striving towards it.
435800	437600	Which brings us back around to Demi Lovato.
437600	441880	I got into a big ol' Twitter fight with some trans activists over the topic, as I often
441880	442920	do, being me.
442920	446280	In Twitter's 240 character limit meant that I mangled a lot of my points.
446280	449560	Knowing that I'd fucked it up, I decided to write everything out to try and accurately
449560	450560	explain my position.
450560	453520	You can go read that if you want, but I'll just tell you the important bits here.
453520	454520	1.
454520	456760	It doesn't actually matter to me if Demi Lovato is non-binary.
456760	461840	When Twitter's Trending tab says Demi Lovato changes bio pronouns to they them, I couldn't
461840	463100	give less of a shit.
463100	466800	When Twitter doesn't let me click on the thing and select Not Interested, I know that this
466800	470440	is something that's being astroturfed to try and revive a celebrity's failing career.
470440	472680	But I don't care what celebs do, and neither should you.
472680	473680	2.
473680	477720	Non-binary may be within the same classification of things as trans, but it's certainly not
477720	479160	the same level of severity.
479160	482960	If you're trans, your biological sex and gender identity are polar opposites of each other,
482960	485900	and you may need to deal with any mental issues that arise as a result of that.
485900	489820	You may need to deal with abuse or lack of support from friends, family, or partners.
489820	493780	You may need to deal with transitioning, socially, hormonally, possibly even surgically.
493780	496440	You may need to deal with learning the social cues of the other gender.
496440	499920	You may need to deal with not passing, and that's a whole other can of worms.
499920	500920	3.
500920	504040	I want you to contrast point 2 with Demi Lovato's situation.
504040	509480	Lovato is a cis-woman-appearing non-binary individual who passes fully as a cis-woman,
509480	513360	acts fully like a cis-woman, fully adopts the public gender role of a cis-woman, with
513360	516940	seemingly no masculine components to that role whatsoever, who doesn't have to worry
516940	521000	about passing, who doesn't have to worry about surgery or hormones or other trans medical
521000	523520	issues, who doesn't have to worry about social ostracization.
523520	527700	A lot of this stems from Lovato's status as a celebrity, but it's not just that.
527700	529720	Like I said, the severity level is not the same.
529720	531200	Here's another example of what I mean.
531200	535580	Destiny considers himself to be non-binary, but he still uses he-him pronouns.
535580	539880	At one point, he talked to Lance of the Serfs, who immediately began the call by congratulating
539880	543460	him for coming out and being one of the biggest trans streamers around.
543460	545760	Is it true you identify as non-binary yet?
545760	546760	Yep.
546760	547760	Congratulations.
547760	548760	That's awesome.
548760	549760	Why?
549760	553400	Well, that by definition would make you one of the largest representative trans streamers
553400	554400	on this platform.
554400	555400	Yeah, but that's really weird.
555400	557280	I got a lot of messages like congratulations.
557280	559280	I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.
559280	560280	Really?
560280	561280	Explain why.
561280	562280	It just feels really weird.
562280	563280	Like why would I?
563280	566560	Why congratulate me for like a sexual identity, I guess it's just kind of a strange feeling,
566560	568680	I guess.
568680	572080	Because you are very successful at what you do, you're one of the top streamers on this
572080	573080	platform.
573080	577200	And then by definition, if you are now going to be able to be representing the trans community,
577200	580880	I think that would be a net benefit to human rights in a way.
580880	583120	So I'm a representative of the trans community now.
583120	584120	I didn't ask for this responsibility.
584120	585120	All right.
585120	589120	Well, that wasn't my implication, but I'm just saying that's.
589960	590960	Okay.
590960	591960	Well, then if you prefer, I don't say congratulations.
591960	592960	I will.
592960	593960	Thank you.
593960	594960	Thank you for respecting that.
594960	598360	Destiny's reaction here seems to be the reaction of a sane individual.
598360	600360	He doesn't want to represent anybody or any community.
600360	604320	He doesn't want to be congratulated for something so asinine as saying I'm non-binary
604320	606160	while not actually changing anything about himself.
606160	611000	And he doesn't consider himself trans or his possible transness as some larger scale
611000	612000	victory.
612000	613860	It's a thing that is solely for him.
613860	615920	It holds meaning only for him.
615920	617480	And that seems to be how it should be.
617480	618480	Consider this.
618840	622640	Demi Lovato was a name that was on nobody's lips before the non-binary announcement.
622640	625040	And since then, that's completely switched around.
625040	628280	Celebrities have been doing things like this to revive careers for decades.
628280	631280	Ten years ago, it might have been coming out as bisexual to make a headline.
631280	634000	Before that, it might have been gossip about relationships or something.
634000	635760	Hollywood is fucking cancerous like this.
635760	638440	I'm not saying that being non-binary doesn't exist.
638440	642520	I'm saying that if you happen to be the type of shitty person who would fake being
642520	646340	something for clout, non-binary would be the thing that you pick right now.
646340	650720	Just like bisexual would be the thing that you picked back in 2005 or 2010.
650720	654700	And even then, I'm not saying that these people are fake in their sexualities or their
654700	656500	relationships or their identities.
656500	660620	I'm saying that there should be a common understanding that even if these things are
660620	665260	real, celebrities always reveal it in such a way to either distract themselves from controversy
665260	667380	or promote something positive about themselves.
667380	671360	My passage on Twitter was never actually a criticism of the non-binary identity.
671360	675260	It was always a criticism of celebrities because this is the sort of thing that celebrities
675260	676260	do.
676300	679740	If there is money to be made in being a thing, then some people will fake being that thing
679740	680740	for the money.
680740	683920	And some other people who do just happen to be that thing anyway, will play it up for
683920	684920	the money.
684920	685920	That's the point.
685920	687460	And oh, you don't think that Demi Lovato would do that?
687460	690700	Are you ignoring the well-documented history of doing this exact sort of thing?
690700	694040	Are you ignoring the constant Twitter tirades that attempt to place Lovato in the center
694040	696940	of any current event, regardless of distance or relevance?
696940	700860	Are you aware of Lovato's documentary about being sober and wellness and etc.
700860	705020	A documentary that was axed because the star of the show was actually massively addicted
705020	708820	to drugs during the filming of it, but was willing to fake it for clout?
708820	710340	This isn't a Caitlyn Jenner situation.
710340	714040	Despite what you might think of her, I'm pretty sure Jenner is not faking it for attention.
714040	716700	If it were all actually just a grift, she would have detransitioned a long time ago.
716700	721420	But the difference is, Jenner doesn't have Lovato's long history of lying and grandstanding.
721420	726120	If a person has a history of being toxic, exploitative, narcissistic, or prone to public
726120	730100	stunts to gain attention, and you tell me that despite all of this, if they come out
730100	734340	as non-binary, I must accept it or be considered transphobic, what you're actually saying
734340	739420	to me is that your activism overrides the actions, the behavior, and the motivations
739420	740780	of the person coming out.
740780	743980	That I must accept their transness unquestioningly at all times.
743980	748180	And if I have even a hunch that something fishy might be up, I'm a bigot who wants
748180	749380	to see trans people exterminated.
749380	751060	No, I don't accept that.
751060	755060	But now that you're telling me this, you've confirmed something to me about trans activism
755060	758400	that I once said as a joke, but didn't actually believe.
758400	762940	At one point during the height of making fictional characters say trans rights, like Donkey Kong
762940	767100	says trans rights, and so on, I said something dumb, like, if Hitler said trans rights on
767100	771040	an Hbomberguy stream, the trans activist would become fascists, or something like that.
771040	772540	It was a dumb throwaway joke.
772540	776860	But then pink news came out in support of a neo-nazi because they were trans.
776860	780620	I was certainly stunned by this, but then I said, okay, you know, maybe this is just
780620	783760	tokenism from a corporation looking to make money, right?
783760	787780	Real on-the-ground trans people aren't going to actually ignore people's crimes because
787780	788780	they're trans, right?
789080	793220	They're not going to actually demand that you accept somebody's transness, even if that
793220	797820	transness might be a tool being wielded for some false purpose, right?
797820	798820	Look at this woman.
798820	802940	This is an average-sized woman on the boardwalk by the beach listening to music and drinking
802940	803940	water.
803940	805120	Seems to be just having a good time.
805120	807260	She's not model size, but I wouldn't say she's obese.
807260	809040	And look at the first comment on it.
809040	811580	We love that mid-sized representation.
811580	813060	What representation is there?
813060	814580	This isn't a piece of fictional media.
814580	817220	This isn't a career hiring or a school class.
817220	819120	This isn't a celebrity plying for eyeballs.
819120	822480	This is a regular person living a regular life, doing nothing out of the ordinary.
822480	823880	But now it's representation.
823880	826640	She doesn't have to be representative of anything other than herself.
826640	830260	And yet the commodification of identities has led people to credit her for something
830260	832780	she's not doing simply because she's in a photo.
832780	837140	Oh, by the way, every time you see that return to tradition shit, it's the rightoids trying
837140	838340	to adopt the same tactics.
838340	842500	They may be commodifying a different identity, one that appeals to rightoids, but it's the
842500	844100	same thing for the same reason.
844100	845300	Don't listen to any of them.
845300	848700	You should be doing whatever feels right for you, but more importantly, you should
848700	850420	be doing it in a humble way.
850420	853700	The Christians were onto something when there was an injunction to public prayer in their
853700	854700	religion.
854700	857740	Even they understood that virtue signaling was ultimately a vice, and I think it applies
857740	858740	here too.
858740	861860	This is why I don't think I'm transphobic and I don't accept the logic of the lefties
861860	862860	who claim that I am.
862860	864260	I don't hate trans people.
864260	865260	I don't want to see them exterminated.
865260	866900	I don't want to see them disappear.
866900	869220	I want to see them receive every bit of help they need.
869220	873100	And if there is some kind of government-run healthcare service in a given area, I think
873100	876440	trans people should have equal access to it in a way that meets their needs.
876440	877740	Same goes for non-binary people too.
877740	882620	I have to admit, on a personal level, I think I would find it hard to regularly use they-them
882620	885060	pronouns if I actually knew somebody who wanted me to.
885060	888700	I can feel that it wouldn't come natural to me, but I also know that I would at least
888700	891740	make an effort for the sake of that person because that's who I am.
891740	896500	But I will never accept the idea that I'm transphobic simply because I notice that some
896500	900320	people are bad and willing to hide behind the progressive sacred cow.
900480	905400	At this point, coming out announcements like this feel as self-indulgent as baby gender
905400	906400	reveal parties.
906400	910280	It's a way to call attention to yourself and your life that might work on some small
910280	914280	scale with, say, just your friends or your family, when it's appropriate.
914280	919080	But when it's done large scale, on an international stage, by a public figure, it just seems gaudy.
919080	921440	I don't care what gender Demi Lovato is.
921440	922960	That's their business, not mine.
922960	926400	But I'm not going to listen to people who tell me that my eyes are lying.
926400	929120	Transness is the newly commodified identity right now.
929120	933360	And while non-binary people most certainly exist, I suspect there's a lot of young people
933360	937760	who want to wave that trans flag for kudos right now, who are setting pronouns as a she-they
937760	941720	and writing long Twitter threads about their new journey of self-discovery, despite there
941720	945280	being no practical difference between them and your average cis woman, in much the same
945280	949800	way that so many bisexual women a decade ago never got with somebody of the same gender
949800	951640	and were never actually attracted to them either.
951640	953600	But hey, it made them look progressive on campus.
953600	955920	That shit made real bi women look bad.
955920	957320	It made lesbians look bad.
957320	960960	And I've now spoken to a number of trans people who feel that this current trend makes
960960	961960	them look bad.
961960	962960	I sympathize with them.
962960	966360	No matter what the progs say, I'm never going to actually be against trans people.
966360	970840	But if they expect me to acquiesce to their ideas that being pro-trans means not accepting
970840	975480	people who are clearly coming out disingenuously, they've got another thing coming.
