00:00.000 --> 00:09.480
So, recently, Demi Lovato came out as non-binary.

00:09.480 --> 00:13.440
For those of you who don't know what non-binary is, the Wikipedia definition will suffice

00:13.440 --> 00:15.160
for this discussion.

00:15.160 --> 00:18.540
Non-binary or genderqueer is an umbrella term for gender identities that are neither male

00:18.540 --> 00:20.160
nor female.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.420
Non-binary identities fall under the transgender umbrella since non-binary people typically

00:24.420 --> 00:27.880
identify with a gender that is different from their assigned sex.

00:27.880 --> 00:31.960
Non-binary people may identify as having two or more genders, having no gender, moving

00:31.960 --> 00:37.180
between genders, or having a fluctuating gender identity, or being a third gender or other

00:37.180 --> 00:38.180
gendered.

00:38.180 --> 00:39.360
Conceptually, this kind of makes sense to me.

00:39.360 --> 00:42.480
Forget about the possible biological arguments for a second, since I know people like to

00:42.480 --> 00:43.480
bring those up.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.680
With good reason, of course.

00:44.680 --> 00:49.000
But set them aside for now, close your eyes, and consider things based on introspection.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.880
Regarding transness, it is reasonable to conceive of a sense of self where it feels like what

00:53.880 --> 00:57.240
gender you should be doesn't match what physical sex you are.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.920
Rather, it matches the other physical sex that you see walking around in the world.

01:00.920 --> 01:05.620
I've never experienced that, but from a purely self-referential internal thought experiment,

01:05.620 --> 01:09.020
it certainly seems possible, and I can imagine what it would be like, roughly speaking.

01:09.020 --> 01:13.440
If you can also imagine it in your own internal thought experiment, then consider this other

01:13.440 --> 01:18.080
possibility, where it feels like what gender you should be doesn't match with what physical

01:18.080 --> 01:22.560
sex you are, but it also doesn't match that other physical sex you see around either.

01:22.560 --> 01:26.880
Rather, your sense of gender is something different, or it's non-existent, or it fluctuates

01:26.920 --> 01:29.560
between the masculine and the feminine on a regular basis.

01:29.560 --> 01:34.240
As an outsider looking in, that is what non-binary seems like it would feel like.

01:34.240 --> 01:38.440
Again, makes sense to me, especially the possibility where your gender fluctuates between masculine

01:38.440 --> 01:39.440
and feminine.

01:39.440 --> 01:42.900
I've never had days where I really feel super feminine, but I've certainly had super

01:42.900 --> 01:47.440
masculine feeling days, and almost agender feeling days throughout my life.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.320
I simply chalk that up to natural hormone fluctuations over time.

01:50.320 --> 01:54.320
In fact, I'd hazard a guess that it's probably a very common experience to view your gender

01:54.320 --> 01:59.720
in this way, as being more or less impactful to your personality in some cyclical manner.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.720
However, beyond just natural fluctuations, when I'm with a woman, or I'm lifting

02:03.720 --> 02:07.840
weights, or I'm performing some kind of hard yet fulfilling physical labor, I certainly

02:07.840 --> 02:12.780
feel more masculine, and I don't think that's just a consequence of socialization, I absolutely

02:12.780 --> 02:16.160
think that the increased testosterone from those activities play a role.

02:16.160 --> 02:20.360
Despite this ebb and flow of gender importance in my day to day life, I'd never actually

02:20.360 --> 02:22.200
consider myself non-binary.

02:22.200 --> 02:26.100
Even if I might actually fit the role under some very broad definitions.

02:26.100 --> 02:29.900
Under those same broad definitions, it feels like almost everyone fits the role.

02:29.900 --> 02:34.880
But now that Demi Lovato has said, my pronouns are they, them, I've noticed a shift in

02:34.880 --> 02:39.960
the discourse, and in my opinion, it's properly described as the final stage of the commodification

02:39.960 --> 02:40.960
of the trans identity.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.760
Let me explain what I mean.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.760
Progressives generally feel that media representation is very important.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.000
I'm sure you've seen stuff like this before.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.540
The BBC will have more gay characters in its shows to combat heteronormative culture.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.080
Why Arab and Islamic representation matters.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.840
LGBTQ series regulars on broadcast TV hit an all-time high.

02:58.840 --> 03:05.040
In fact, the TV industry is urged to increase LGBTQ representation to 20%, despite the LGBT

03:05.040 --> 03:07.840
population being at only around 4.5%.

03:07.840 --> 03:12.040
I understand, on some level, the necessity of seeing at least a few people like you in

03:12.040 --> 03:13.400
the media that you consume.

03:13.400 --> 03:16.720
At this point, I'm sure we've all seen those interviews, where Whoopi Goldberg says

03:16.720 --> 03:20.800
she was inspired by Nichelle Nichols on the original Star Trek, playing a role as a black

03:20.800 --> 03:24.760
person who wasn't a villain or a servant, but was actually doing something important

03:24.760 --> 03:25.760
on the Enterprise.

03:25.760 --> 03:29.120
And a similar story, where Nichols wanted to leave the series but was convinced not

03:29.120 --> 03:32.680
to do so by Martin Luther King Jr. for the exact same reasons.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.600
Despite everything that was going on in the United States at the time, here was a black

03:35.600 --> 03:40.080
woman in a position of importance in the future, a person of competence and intelligence, who

03:40.080 --> 03:44.280
was showing the audiences of the day what black people could be, in an era of TV that

03:44.280 --> 03:45.280
didn't really do that.

03:45.360 --> 03:50.240
I also understand the artistic appeal of making race-bent or gender-bent variations of previously

03:50.240 --> 03:51.640
existing properties.

03:51.640 --> 03:55.620
Othello is a play about a Maghreb general in otherwise all Italian society, generally

03:55.620 --> 03:59.360
played nowadays by a black actor among a white troupe, but there's certainly value in a

03:59.360 --> 04:03.000
race-swapped portrayal, where Othello is white and everybody else is black.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.000
Seeing Robin as a girl in The Dark Knight Returns was, similarly, a lot of fun, and

04:07.000 --> 04:11.600
the story's more grotesque style translated into the character being rather ugly, but

04:11.600 --> 04:13.240
in a specifically androgynous way.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.040
That's not to say that androgyny is always ugly, obviously, but when it is ugly, it's

04:17.040 --> 04:18.040
like this.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.980
I don't even necessarily mind the stuff that makes historical figures different than

04:20.980 --> 04:24.240
they were, if the point of the work isn't historical accuracy.

04:24.240 --> 04:27.880
I think that's why people made fun of Battlefield V so relentlessly.

04:27.880 --> 04:31.600
Not because it was putting disabled female soldiers of colour into World War II, but

04:31.600 --> 04:34.840
because it was doing it and claiming it was an accurate portrayal of history.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.680
If they had said, listen, we're just having fun here, I wouldn't have given it a second

04:37.680 --> 04:38.680
thought.

04:38.680 --> 04:41.920
This is all stuff that the progs are correct about on some level, but it also leads to

04:41.920 --> 04:44.880
a pretty shitty end result that they've completely embraced.

04:44.880 --> 04:48.960
If representation for the sake of representation becomes popular, it makes money.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.840
And if it makes money, there will be somebody out there willing to do it not for the sake

04:52.840 --> 04:55.500
of the representation, but for the sake of the money.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.200
This is another one of those old man dev stories I tell on this channel a lot, but back when

04:59.200 --> 05:03.320
I was a young leftist, the discourse revolved a lot around tokenism, the practice of making

05:03.320 --> 05:07.920
a symbolic effort at inclusion, sometimes even a real effort at inclusion, not because

05:07.920 --> 05:12.440
you value inclusivity as an end in itself, but because you value the money that inclusivity

05:12.440 --> 05:17.080
brings, or inversely, you fear the loss of money that not being inclusive would bring.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.580
Back in my day, a lot of the efforts that were moving towards inclusivity were derided

05:20.580 --> 05:23.360
by leftists as being just tokenism.

05:23.360 --> 05:27.600
It's my experience that you can often tell if something is actually soulless tokenism

05:27.600 --> 05:30.360
if it doesn't represent reality in any way when you see it.

05:30.360 --> 05:34.960
It's a big fat red flag when characters shoehorn the author's politics into conversations.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.340
tokenism is when the new stewards of a property are completely unwilling to adhere to the

05:38.340 --> 05:42.720
pre-established lore of that property in the name of representation, and also when the

05:42.720 --> 05:46.080
discrimination that's alleged in the story doesn't really seem to actually exist in real

05:46.080 --> 05:47.360
life all that much.

05:47.360 --> 05:52.280
I mean sure, I can see how a girl might be teased for being too tall in school, but that's

05:52.280 --> 05:56.340
simply because kids are shitty creatures and will tease you for anything, not because they

05:56.340 --> 05:58.440
actually hate tallness.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.640
I mean really guys?

06:00.640 --> 06:01.640
Really?

06:02.040 --> 06:05.920
Thus far we've only spoken about representation in fiction, which let's be honest doesn't

06:05.920 --> 06:10.360
actually mean anything big picture, even taking the star trek example into account.

06:10.360 --> 06:13.560
It's an entirely different set of problems when you begin to talk about representation

06:13.560 --> 06:17.640
within technical fields, where the person's qualifications are the only variable that

06:17.640 --> 06:18.760
matters.

06:18.760 --> 06:23.060
Tokenism here is far more unjustifiable, because if it turns out that a specific group of people,

06:23.060 --> 06:27.320
for whatever reason I'm not saying genetics, doesn't produce as many scientists for example,

06:27.360 --> 06:32.240
Establishing hiring quotas or admittance quotas for schools causes serious problems.

06:32.240 --> 06:36.440
You want the best people possible in these positions regardless of race or gender, but

06:36.440 --> 06:37.480
not just that.

06:37.480 --> 06:41.320
If let's say you admit a bunch of people who can't hack it to a difficult technical

06:41.320 --> 06:45.520
program based on their race and they all drop out, you're artificially inflating the drop

06:45.520 --> 06:50.120
out statistics for that race, creating the snowballing problem of over-investment into

06:50.120 --> 06:53.960
a group, spawning the very conditions that require the investment.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.120
And of course, nobody ever sees it the other way around.

06:56.120 --> 07:00.240
For example, trans women are drastically overrepresented in the field of computer programming,

07:00.240 --> 07:03.480
but nobody wants to limit their participation in that field, and it wouldn't be a good idea

07:03.480 --> 07:06.080
to do so, because skill should be the name of the game.

07:06.080 --> 07:10.720
And despite all of this, leftists nowadays have completely leaned into tokenism, to the

07:10.720 --> 07:15.800
point that progress now means rejecting colorblindness rather than striving towards it.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.600
Which brings us back around to Demi Lovato.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.880
I got into a big ol' Twitter fight with some trans activists over the topic, as I often

07:21.880 --> 07:22.920
do, being me.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.280
In Twitter's 240 character limit meant that I mangled a lot of my points.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.560
Knowing that I'd fucked it up, I decided to write everything out to try and accurately

07:29.560 --> 07:30.560
explain my position.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.520
You can go read that if you want, but I'll just tell you the important bits here.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.520
1.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.760
It doesn't actually matter to me if Demi Lovato is non-binary.

07:36.760 --> 07:41.840
When Twitter's Trending tab says Demi Lovato changes bio pronouns to they them, I couldn't

07:41.840 --> 07:43.100
give less of a shit.

07:43.100 --> 07:46.800
When Twitter doesn't let me click on the thing and select Not Interested, I know that this

07:46.800 --> 07:50.440
is something that's being astroturfed to try and revive a celebrity's failing career.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.680
But I don't care what celebs do, and neither should you.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.680
2.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.720
Non-binary may be within the same classification of things as trans, but it's certainly not

07:57.720 --> 07:59.160
the same level of severity.

07:59.160 --> 08:02.960
If you're trans, your biological sex and gender identity are polar opposites of each other,

08:02.960 --> 08:05.900
and you may need to deal with any mental issues that arise as a result of that.

08:05.900 --> 08:09.820
You may need to deal with abuse or lack of support from friends, family, or partners.

08:09.820 --> 08:13.780
You may need to deal with transitioning, socially, hormonally, possibly even surgically.

08:13.780 --> 08:16.440
You may need to deal with learning the social cues of the other gender.

08:16.440 --> 08:19.920
You may need to deal with not passing, and that's a whole other can of worms.

08:19.920 --> 08:20.920
3.

08:20.920 --> 08:24.040
I want you to contrast point 2 with Demi Lovato's situation.

08:24.040 --> 08:29.480
Lovato is a cis-woman-appearing non-binary individual who passes fully as a cis-woman,

08:29.480 --> 08:33.360
acts fully like a cis-woman, fully adopts the public gender role of a cis-woman, with

08:33.360 --> 08:36.940
seemingly no masculine components to that role whatsoever, who doesn't have to worry

08:36.940 --> 08:41.000
about passing, who doesn't have to worry about surgery or hormones or other trans medical

08:41.000 --> 08:43.520
issues, who doesn't have to worry about social ostracization.

08:43.520 --> 08:47.700
A lot of this stems from Lovato's status as a celebrity, but it's not just that.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.720
Like I said, the severity level is not the same.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.200
Here's another example of what I mean.

08:51.200 --> 08:55.580
Destiny considers himself to be non-binary, but he still uses he-him pronouns.

08:55.580 --> 08:59.880
At one point, he talked to Lance of the Serfs, who immediately began the call by congratulating

08:59.880 --> 09:03.460
him for coming out and being one of the biggest trans streamers around.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.760
Is it true you identify as non-binary yet?

09:05.760 --> 09:06.760
Yep.

09:06.760 --> 09:07.760
Congratulations.

09:07.760 --> 09:08.760
That's awesome.

09:08.760 --> 09:09.760
Why?

09:09.760 --> 09:13.400
Well, that by definition would make you one of the largest representative trans streamers

09:13.400 --> 09:14.400
on this platform.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.400
Yeah, but that's really weird.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.280
I got a lot of messages like congratulations.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.280
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.280
Really?

09:20.280 --> 09:21.280
Explain why.

09:21.280 --> 09:22.280
It just feels really weird.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.280
Like why would I?

09:23.280 --> 09:26.560
Why congratulate me for like a sexual identity, I guess it's just kind of a strange feeling,

09:26.560 --> 09:28.680
I guess.

09:28.680 --> 09:32.080
Because you are very successful at what you do, you're one of the top streamers on this

09:32.080 --> 09:33.080
platform.

09:33.080 --> 09:37.200
And then by definition, if you are now going to be able to be representing the trans community,

09:37.200 --> 09:40.880
I think that would be a net benefit to human rights in a way.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.120
So I'm a representative of the trans community now.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.120
I didn't ask for this responsibility.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.120
All right.

09:45.120 --> 09:49.120
Well, that wasn't my implication, but I'm just saying that's.

09:49.960 --> 09:50.960
Okay.

09:50.960 --> 09:51.960
Well, then if you prefer, I don't say congratulations.

09:51.960 --> 09:52.960
I will.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.960
Thank you.

09:53.960 --> 09:54.960
Thank you for respecting that.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.360
Destiny's reaction here seems to be the reaction of a sane individual.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.360
He doesn't want to represent anybody or any community.

10:00.360 --> 10:04.320
He doesn't want to be congratulated for something so asinine as saying I'm non-binary

10:04.320 --> 10:06.160
while not actually changing anything about himself.

10:06.160 --> 10:11.000
And he doesn't consider himself trans or his possible transness as some larger scale

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
victory.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.860
It's a thing that is solely for him.

10:13.860 --> 10:15.920
It holds meaning only for him.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.480
And that seems to be how it should be.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.480
Consider this.

10:18.840 --> 10:22.640
Demi Lovato was a name that was on nobody's lips before the non-binary announcement.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.040
And since then, that's completely switched around.

10:25.040 --> 10:28.280
Celebrities have been doing things like this to revive careers for decades.

10:28.280 --> 10:31.280
Ten years ago, it might have been coming out as bisexual to make a headline.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.000
Before that, it might have been gossip about relationships or something.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.760
Hollywood is fucking cancerous like this.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.440
I'm not saying that being non-binary doesn't exist.

10:38.440 --> 10:42.520
I'm saying that if you happen to be the type of shitty person who would fake being

10:42.520 --> 10:46.340
something for clout, non-binary would be the thing that you pick right now.

10:46.340 --> 10:50.720
Just like bisexual would be the thing that you picked back in 2005 or 2010.

10:50.720 --> 10:54.700
And even then, I'm not saying that these people are fake in their sexualities or their

10:54.700 --> 10:56.500
relationships or their identities.

10:56.500 --> 11:00.620
I'm saying that there should be a common understanding that even if these things are

11:00.620 --> 11:05.260
real, celebrities always reveal it in such a way to either distract themselves from controversy

11:05.260 --> 11:07.380
or promote something positive about themselves.

11:07.380 --> 11:11.360
My passage on Twitter was never actually a criticism of the non-binary identity.

11:11.360 --> 11:15.260
It was always a criticism of celebrities because this is the sort of thing that celebrities

11:15.260 --> 11:16.260
do.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.740
If there is money to be made in being a thing, then some people will fake being that thing

11:19.740 --> 11:20.740
for the money.

11:20.740 --> 11:23.920
And some other people who do just happen to be that thing anyway, will play it up for

11:23.920 --> 11:24.920
the money.

11:24.920 --> 11:25.920
That's the point.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.460
And oh, you don't think that Demi Lovato would do that?

11:27.460 --> 11:30.700
Are you ignoring the well-documented history of doing this exact sort of thing?

11:30.700 --> 11:34.040
Are you ignoring the constant Twitter tirades that attempt to place Lovato in the center

11:34.040 --> 11:36.940
of any current event, regardless of distance or relevance?

11:36.940 --> 11:40.860
Are you aware of Lovato's documentary about being sober and wellness and etc.

11:40.860 --> 11:45.020
A documentary that was axed because the star of the show was actually massively addicted

11:45.020 --> 11:48.820
to drugs during the filming of it, but was willing to fake it for clout?

11:48.820 --> 11:50.340
This isn't a Caitlyn Jenner situation.

11:50.340 --> 11:54.040
Despite what you might think of her, I'm pretty sure Jenner is not faking it for attention.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.700
If it were all actually just a grift, she would have detransitioned a long time ago.

11:56.700 --> 12:01.420
But the difference is, Jenner doesn't have Lovato's long history of lying and grandstanding.

12:01.420 --> 12:06.120
If a person has a history of being toxic, exploitative, narcissistic, or prone to public

12:06.120 --> 12:10.100
stunts to gain attention, and you tell me that despite all of this, if they come out

12:10.100 --> 12:14.340
as non-binary, I must accept it or be considered transphobic, what you're actually saying

12:14.340 --> 12:19.420
to me is that your activism overrides the actions, the behavior, and the motivations

12:19.420 --> 12:20.780
of the person coming out.

12:20.780 --> 12:23.980
That I must accept their transness unquestioningly at all times.

12:23.980 --> 12:28.180
And if I have even a hunch that something fishy might be up, I'm a bigot who wants

12:28.180 --> 12:29.380
to see trans people exterminated.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.060
No, I don't accept that.

12:31.060 --> 12:35.060
But now that you're telling me this, you've confirmed something to me about trans activism

12:35.060 --> 12:38.400
that I once said as a joke, but didn't actually believe.

12:38.400 --> 12:42.940
At one point during the height of making fictional characters say trans rights, like Donkey Kong

12:42.940 --> 12:47.100
says trans rights, and so on, I said something dumb, like, if Hitler said trans rights on

12:47.100 --> 12:51.040
an Hbomberguy stream, the trans activist would become fascists, or something like that.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.540
It was a dumb throwaway joke.

12:52.540 --> 12:56.860
But then pink news came out in support of a neo-nazi because they were trans.

12:56.860 --> 13:00.620
I was certainly stunned by this, but then I said, okay, you know, maybe this is just

13:00.620 --> 13:03.760
tokenism from a corporation looking to make money, right?

13:03.760 --> 13:07.780
Real on-the-ground trans people aren't going to actually ignore people's crimes because

13:07.780 --> 13:08.780
they're trans, right?

13:09.080 --> 13:13.220
They're not going to actually demand that you accept somebody's transness, even if that

13:13.220 --> 13:17.820
transness might be a tool being wielded for some false purpose, right?

13:17.820 --> 13:18.820
Look at this woman.

13:18.820 --> 13:22.940
This is an average-sized woman on the boardwalk by the beach listening to music and drinking

13:22.940 --> 13:23.940
water.

13:23.940 --> 13:25.120
Seems to be just having a good time.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.260
She's not model size, but I wouldn't say she's obese.

13:27.260 --> 13:29.040
And look at the first comment on it.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.580
We love that mid-sized representation.

13:31.580 --> 13:33.060
What representation is there?

13:33.060 --> 13:34.580
This isn't a piece of fictional media.

13:34.580 --> 13:37.220
This isn't a career hiring or a school class.

13:37.220 --> 13:39.120
This isn't a celebrity plying for eyeballs.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.480
This is a regular person living a regular life, doing nothing out of the ordinary.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.880
But now it's representation.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.640
She doesn't have to be representative of anything other than herself.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.260
And yet the commodification of identities has led people to credit her for something

13:50.260 --> 13:52.780
she's not doing simply because she's in a photo.

13:52.780 --> 13:57.140
Oh, by the way, every time you see that return to tradition shit, it's the rightoids trying

13:57.140 --> 13:58.340
to adopt the same tactics.

13:58.340 --> 14:02.500
They may be commodifying a different identity, one that appeals to rightoids, but it's the

14:02.500 --> 14:04.100
same thing for the same reason.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.300
Don't listen to any of them.

14:05.300 --> 14:08.700
You should be doing whatever feels right for you, but more importantly, you should

14:08.700 --> 14:10.420
be doing it in a humble way.

14:10.420 --> 14:13.700
The Christians were onto something when there was an injunction to public prayer in their

14:13.700 --> 14:14.700
religion.

14:14.700 --> 14:17.740
Even they understood that virtue signaling was ultimately a vice, and I think it applies

14:17.740 --> 14:18.740
here too.

14:18.740 --> 14:21.860
This is why I don't think I'm transphobic and I don't accept the logic of the lefties

14:21.860 --> 14:22.860
who claim that I am.

14:22.860 --> 14:24.260
I don't hate trans people.

14:24.260 --> 14:25.260
I don't want to see them exterminated.

14:25.260 --> 14:26.900
I don't want to see them disappear.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.220
I want to see them receive every bit of help they need.

14:29.220 --> 14:33.100
And if there is some kind of government-run healthcare service in a given area, I think

14:33.100 --> 14:36.440
trans people should have equal access to it in a way that meets their needs.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.740
Same goes for non-binary people too.

14:37.740 --> 14:42.620
I have to admit, on a personal level, I think I would find it hard to regularly use they-them

14:42.620 --> 14:45.060
pronouns if I actually knew somebody who wanted me to.

14:45.060 --> 14:48.700
I can feel that it wouldn't come natural to me, but I also know that I would at least

14:48.700 --> 14:51.740
make an effort for the sake of that person because that's who I am.

14:51.740 --> 14:56.500
But I will never accept the idea that I'm transphobic simply because I notice that some

14:56.500 --> 15:00.320
people are bad and willing to hide behind the progressive sacred cow.

15:00.480 --> 15:05.400
At this point, coming out announcements like this feel as self-indulgent as baby gender

15:05.400 --> 15:06.400
reveal parties.

15:06.400 --> 15:10.280
It's a way to call attention to yourself and your life that might work on some small

15:10.280 --> 15:14.280
scale with, say, just your friends or your family, when it's appropriate.

15:14.280 --> 15:19.080
But when it's done large scale, on an international stage, by a public figure, it just seems gaudy.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.440
I don't care what gender Demi Lovato is.

15:21.440 --> 15:22.960
That's their business, not mine.

15:22.960 --> 15:26.400
But I'm not going to listen to people who tell me that my eyes are lying.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.120
Transness is the newly commodified identity right now.

15:29.120 --> 15:33.360
And while non-binary people most certainly exist, I suspect there's a lot of young people

15:33.360 --> 15:37.760
who want to wave that trans flag for kudos right now, who are setting pronouns as a she-they

15:37.760 --> 15:41.720
and writing long Twitter threads about their new journey of self-discovery, despite there

15:41.720 --> 15:45.280
being no practical difference between them and your average cis woman, in much the same

15:45.280 --> 15:49.800
way that so many bisexual women a decade ago never got with somebody of the same gender

15:49.800 --> 15:51.640
and were never actually attracted to them either.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.600
But hey, it made them look progressive on campus.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.920
That shit made real bi women look bad.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.320
It made lesbians look bad.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.960
And I've now spoken to a number of trans people who feel that this current trend makes

16:00.960 --> 16:01.960
them look bad.

16:01.960 --> 16:02.960
I sympathize with them.

16:02.960 --> 16:06.360
No matter what the progs say, I'm never going to actually be against trans people.

16:06.360 --> 16:10.840
But if they expect me to acquiesce to their ideas that being pro-trans means not accepting

16:10.840 --> 16:15.480
people who are clearly coming out disingenuously, they've got another thing coming.
