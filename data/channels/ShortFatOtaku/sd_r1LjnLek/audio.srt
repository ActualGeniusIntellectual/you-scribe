1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
So, recently, Demi Lovato came out as non-binary.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,440
For those of you who don't know what non-binary is, the Wikipedia definition will suffice

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,160
for this discussion.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,540
Non-binary or genderqueer is an umbrella term for gender identities that are neither male

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,160
nor female.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,420
Non-binary identities fall under the transgender umbrella since non-binary people typically

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,880
identify with a gender that is different from their assigned sex.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,960
Non-binary people may identify as having two or more genders, having no gender, moving

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,180
between genders, or having a fluctuating gender identity, or being a third gender or other

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,180
gendered.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,360
Conceptually, this kind of makes sense to me.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,480
Forget about the possible biological arguments for a second, since I know people like to

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
bring those up.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,680
With good reason, of course.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,000
But set them aside for now, close your eyes, and consider things based on introspection.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,880
Regarding transness, it is reasonable to conceive of a sense of self where it feels like what

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,240
gender you should be doesn't match what physical sex you are.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,920
Rather, it matches the other physical sex that you see walking around in the world.

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,620
I've never experienced that, but from a purely self-referential internal thought experiment,

20
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,020
it certainly seems possible, and I can imagine what it would be like, roughly speaking.

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,440
If you can also imagine it in your own internal thought experiment, then consider this other

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,080
possibility, where it feels like what gender you should be doesn't match with what physical

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,560
sex you are, but it also doesn't match that other physical sex you see around either.

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,880
Rather, your sense of gender is something different, or it's non-existent, or it fluctuates

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,560
between the masculine and the feminine on a regular basis.

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,240
As an outsider looking in, that is what non-binary seems like it would feel like.

27
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,440
Again, makes sense to me, especially the possibility where your gender fluctuates between masculine

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
and feminine.

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,900
I've never had days where I really feel super feminine, but I've certainly had super

30
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,440
masculine feeling days, and almost agender feeling days throughout my life.

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,320
I simply chalk that up to natural hormone fluctuations over time.

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
In fact, I'd hazard a guess that it's probably a very common experience to view your gender

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,720
in this way, as being more or less impactful to your personality in some cyclical manner.

34
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,720
However, beyond just natural fluctuations, when I'm with a woman, or I'm lifting

35
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,840
weights, or I'm performing some kind of hard yet fulfilling physical labor, I certainly

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,780
feel more masculine, and I don't think that's just a consequence of socialization, I absolutely

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,160
think that the increased testosterone from those activities play a role.

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,360
Despite this ebb and flow of gender importance in my day to day life, I'd never actually

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,200
consider myself non-binary.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,100
Even if I might actually fit the role under some very broad definitions.

41
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,900
Under those same broad definitions, it feels like almost everyone fits the role.

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,880
But now that Demi Lovato has said, my pronouns are they, them, I've noticed a shift in

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,960
the discourse, and in my opinion, it's properly described as the final stage of the commodification

44
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
of the trans identity.

45
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,760
Let me explain what I mean.

46
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,760
Progressives generally feel that media representation is very important.

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sure you've seen stuff like this before.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,540
The BBC will have more gay characters in its shows to combat heteronormative culture.

49
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,080
Why Arab and Islamic representation matters.

50
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,840
LGBTQ series regulars on broadcast TV hit an all-time high.

51
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,040
In fact, the TV industry is urged to increase LGBTQ representation to 20%, despite the LGBT

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,840
population being at only around 4.5%.

53
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,040
I understand, on some level, the necessity of seeing at least a few people like you in

54
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,400
the media that you consume.

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,720
At this point, I'm sure we've all seen those interviews, where Whoopi Goldberg says

56
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,800
she was inspired by Nichelle Nichols on the original Star Trek, playing a role as a black

57
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,760
person who wasn't a villain or a servant, but was actually doing something important

58
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
on the Enterprise.

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,120
And a similar story, where Nichols wanted to leave the series but was convinced not

60
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,680
to do so by Martin Luther King Jr. for the exact same reasons.

61
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,600
Despite everything that was going on in the United States at the time, here was a black

62
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,080
woman in a position of importance in the future, a person of competence and intelligence, who

63
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,280
was showing the audiences of the day what black people could be, in an era of TV that

64
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
didn't really do that.

65
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,240
I also understand the artistic appeal of making race-bent or gender-bent variations of previously

66
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,640
existing properties.

67
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,620
Othello is a play about a Maghreb general in otherwise all Italian society, generally

68
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,360
played nowadays by a black actor among a white troupe, but there's certainly value in a

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,000
race-swapped portrayal, where Othello is white and everybody else is black.

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Seeing Robin as a girl in The Dark Knight Returns was, similarly, a lot of fun, and

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,600
the story's more grotesque style translated into the character being rather ugly, but

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,240
in a specifically androgynous way.

73
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,040
That's not to say that androgyny is always ugly, obviously, but when it is ugly, it's

74
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
like this.

75
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,980
I don't even necessarily mind the stuff that makes historical figures different than

76
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,240
they were, if the point of the work isn't historical accuracy.

77
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,880
I think that's why people made fun of Battlefield V so relentlessly.

78
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,600
Not because it was putting disabled female soldiers of colour into World War II, but

79
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,840
because it was doing it and claiming it was an accurate portrayal of history.

80
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,680
If they had said, listen, we're just having fun here, I wouldn't have given it a second

81
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
thought.

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,920
This is all stuff that the progs are correct about on some level, but it also leads to

83
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,880
a pretty shitty end result that they've completely embraced.

84
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,960
If representation for the sake of representation becomes popular, it makes money.

85
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,840
And if it makes money, there will be somebody out there willing to do it not for the sake

86
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,500
of the representation, but for the sake of the money.

87
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,200
This is another one of those old man dev stories I tell on this channel a lot, but back when

88
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,320
I was a young leftist, the discourse revolved a lot around tokenism, the practice of making

89
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,920
a symbolic effort at inclusion, sometimes even a real effort at inclusion, not because

90
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,440
you value inclusivity as an end in itself, but because you value the money that inclusivity

91
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,080
brings, or inversely, you fear the loss of money that not being inclusive would bring.

92
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,580
Back in my day, a lot of the efforts that were moving towards inclusivity were derided

93
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,360
by leftists as being just tokenism.

94
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,600
It's my experience that you can often tell if something is actually soulless tokenism

95
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,360
if it doesn't represent reality in any way when you see it.

96
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,960
It's a big fat red flag when characters shoehorn the author's politics into conversations.

97
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,340
tokenism is when the new stewards of a property are completely unwilling to adhere to the

98
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,720
pre-established lore of that property in the name of representation, and also when the

99
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
discrimination that's alleged in the story doesn't really seem to actually exist in real

100
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,360
life all that much.

101
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,280
I mean sure, I can see how a girl might be teased for being too tall in school, but that's

102
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,340
simply because kids are shitty creatures and will tease you for anything, not because they

103
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,440
actually hate tallness.

104
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,640
I mean really guys?

105
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Really?

106
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,920
Thus far we've only spoken about representation in fiction, which let's be honest doesn't

107
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,360
actually mean anything big picture, even taking the star trek example into account.

108
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,560
It's an entirely different set of problems when you begin to talk about representation

109
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,640
within technical fields, where the person's qualifications are the only variable that

110
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,760
matters.

111
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,060
Tokenism here is far more unjustifiable, because if it turns out that a specific group of people,

112
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,320
for whatever reason I'm not saying genetics, doesn't produce as many scientists for example,

113
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,240
Establishing hiring quotas or admittance quotas for schools causes serious problems.

114
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,440
You want the best people possible in these positions regardless of race or gender, but

115
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,480
not just that.

116
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,320
If let's say you admit a bunch of people who can't hack it to a difficult technical

117
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,520
program based on their race and they all drop out, you're artificially inflating the drop

118
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,120
out statistics for that race, creating the snowballing problem of over-investment into

119
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,960
a group, spawning the very conditions that require the investment.

120
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,120
And of course, nobody ever sees it the other way around.

121
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,240
For example, trans women are drastically overrepresented in the field of computer programming,

122
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,480
but nobody wants to limit their participation in that field, and it wouldn't be a good idea

123
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,080
to do so, because skill should be the name of the game.

124
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,720
And despite all of this, leftists nowadays have completely leaned into tokenism, to the

125
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,800
point that progress now means rejecting colorblindness rather than striving towards it.

126
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,600
Which brings us back around to Demi Lovato.

127
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,880
I got into a big ol' Twitter fight with some trans activists over the topic, as I often

128
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,920
do, being me.

129
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,280
In Twitter's 240 character limit meant that I mangled a lot of my points.

130
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,560
Knowing that I'd fucked it up, I decided to write everything out to try and accurately

131
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
explain my position.

132
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,520
You can go read that if you want, but I'll just tell you the important bits here.

133
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
1.

134
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,760
It doesn't actually matter to me if Demi Lovato is non-binary.

135
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,840
When Twitter's Trending tab says Demi Lovato changes bio pronouns to they them, I couldn't

136
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,100
give less of a shit.

137
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,800
When Twitter doesn't let me click on the thing and select Not Interested, I know that this

138
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,440
is something that's being astroturfed to try and revive a celebrity's failing career.

139
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,680
But I don't care what celebs do, and neither should you.

140
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
2.

141
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,720
Non-binary may be within the same classification of things as trans, but it's certainly not

142
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,160
the same level of severity.

143
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,960
If you're trans, your biological sex and gender identity are polar opposites of each other,

144
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,900
and you may need to deal with any mental issues that arise as a result of that.

145
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,820
You may need to deal with abuse or lack of support from friends, family, or partners.

146
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,780
You may need to deal with transitioning, socially, hormonally, possibly even surgically.

147
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,440
You may need to deal with learning the social cues of the other gender.

148
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,920
You may need to deal with not passing, and that's a whole other can of worms.

149
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
3.

150
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,040
I want you to contrast point 2 with Demi Lovato's situation.

151
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,480
Lovato is a cis-woman-appearing non-binary individual who passes fully as a cis-woman,

152
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,360
acts fully like a cis-woman, fully adopts the public gender role of a cis-woman, with

153
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,940
seemingly no masculine components to that role whatsoever, who doesn't have to worry

154
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,000
about passing, who doesn't have to worry about surgery or hormones or other trans medical

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,520
issues, who doesn't have to worry about social ostracization.

156
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,700
A lot of this stems from Lovato's status as a celebrity, but it's not just that.

157
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,720
Like I said, the severity level is not the same.

158
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,200
Here's another example of what I mean.

159
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,580
Destiny considers himself to be non-binary, but he still uses he-him pronouns.

160
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,880
At one point, he talked to Lance of the Serfs, who immediately began the call by congratulating

161
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,460
him for coming out and being one of the biggest trans streamers around.

162
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,760
Is it true you identify as non-binary yet?

163
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Yep.

164
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Congratulations.

165
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
That's awesome.

166
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,760
Why?

167
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,400
Well, that by definition would make you one of the largest representative trans streamers

168
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
on this platform.

169
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Yeah, but that's really weird.

170
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,280
I got a lot of messages like congratulations.

171
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,280
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

172
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Really?

173
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Explain why.

174
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
It just feels really weird.

175
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Like why would I?

176
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,560
Why congratulate me for like a sexual identity, I guess it's just kind of a strange feeling,

177
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,680
I guess.

178
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,080
Because you are very successful at what you do, you're one of the top streamers on this

179
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,080
platform.

180
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,200
And then by definition, if you are now going to be able to be representing the trans community,

181
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,880
I think that would be a net benefit to human rights in a way.

182
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,120
So I'm a representative of the trans community now.

183
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
I didn't ask for this responsibility.

184
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
All right.

185
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Well, that wasn't my implication, but I'm just saying that's.

186
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Okay.

187
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Well, then if you prefer, I don't say congratulations.

188
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
I will.

189
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Thank you.

190
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Thank you for respecting that.

191
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,360
Destiny's reaction here seems to be the reaction of a sane individual.

192
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,360
He doesn't want to represent anybody or any community.

193
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,320
He doesn't want to be congratulated for something so asinine as saying I'm non-binary

194
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,160
while not actually changing anything about himself.

195
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,000
And he doesn't consider himself trans or his possible transness as some larger scale

196
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
victory.

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,860
It's a thing that is solely for him.

198
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,920
It holds meaning only for him.

199
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,480
And that seems to be how it should be.

200
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Consider this.

201
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,640
Demi Lovato was a name that was on nobody's lips before the non-binary announcement.

202
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
And since then, that's completely switched around.

203
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,280
Celebrities have been doing things like this to revive careers for decades.

204
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Ten years ago, it might have been coming out as bisexual to make a headline.

205
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,000
Before that, it might have been gossip about relationships or something.

206
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,760
Hollywood is fucking cancerous like this.

207
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,440
I'm not saying that being non-binary doesn't exist.

208
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,520
I'm saying that if you happen to be the type of shitty person who would fake being

209
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,340
something for clout, non-binary would be the thing that you pick right now.

210
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,720
Just like bisexual would be the thing that you picked back in 2005 or 2010.

211
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,700
And even then, I'm not saying that these people are fake in their sexualities or their

212
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,500
relationships or their identities.

213
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,620
I'm saying that there should be a common understanding that even if these things are

214
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,260
real, celebrities always reveal it in such a way to either distract themselves from controversy

215
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,380
or promote something positive about themselves.

216
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,360
My passage on Twitter was never actually a criticism of the non-binary identity.

217
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,260
It was always a criticism of celebrities because this is the sort of thing that celebrities

218
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,260
do.

219
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,740
If there is money to be made in being a thing, then some people will fake being that thing

220
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,740
for the money.

221
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,920
And some other people who do just happen to be that thing anyway, will play it up for

222
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
the money.

223
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
That's the point.

224
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,460
And oh, you don't think that Demi Lovato would do that?

225
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,700
Are you ignoring the well-documented history of doing this exact sort of thing?

226
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,040
Are you ignoring the constant Twitter tirades that attempt to place Lovato in the center

227
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,940
of any current event, regardless of distance or relevance?

228
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,860
Are you aware of Lovato's documentary about being sober and wellness and etc.

229
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,020
A documentary that was axed because the star of the show was actually massively addicted

230
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,820
to drugs during the filming of it, but was willing to fake it for clout?

231
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,340
This isn't a Caitlyn Jenner situation.

232
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,040
Despite what you might think of her, I'm pretty sure Jenner is not faking it for attention.

233
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,700
If it were all actually just a grift, she would have detransitioned a long time ago.

234
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,420
But the difference is, Jenner doesn't have Lovato's long history of lying and grandstanding.

235
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,120
If a person has a history of being toxic, exploitative, narcissistic, or prone to public

236
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,100
stunts to gain attention, and you tell me that despite all of this, if they come out

237
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,340
as non-binary, I must accept it or be considered transphobic, what you're actually saying

238
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,420
to me is that your activism overrides the actions, the behavior, and the motivations

239
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,780
of the person coming out.

240
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,980
That I must accept their transness unquestioningly at all times.

241
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,180
And if I have even a hunch that something fishy might be up, I'm a bigot who wants

242
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,380
to see trans people exterminated.

243
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,060
No, I don't accept that.

244
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,060
But now that you're telling me this, you've confirmed something to me about trans activism

245
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,400
that I once said as a joke, but didn't actually believe.

246
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,940
At one point during the height of making fictional characters say trans rights, like Donkey Kong

247
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,100
says trans rights, and so on, I said something dumb, like, if Hitler said trans rights on

248
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,040
an Hbomberguy stream, the trans activist would become fascists, or something like that.

249
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,540
It was a dumb throwaway joke.

250
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,860
But then pink news came out in support of a neo-nazi because they were trans.

251
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,620
I was certainly stunned by this, but then I said, okay, you know, maybe this is just

252
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,760
tokenism from a corporation looking to make money, right?

253
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,780
Real on-the-ground trans people aren't going to actually ignore people's crimes because

254
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,780
they're trans, right?

255
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,220
They're not going to actually demand that you accept somebody's transness, even if that

256
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,820
transness might be a tool being wielded for some false purpose, right?

257
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Look at this woman.

258
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,940
This is an average-sized woman on the boardwalk by the beach listening to music and drinking

259
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,940
water.

260
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,120
Seems to be just having a good time.

261
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,260
She's not model size, but I wouldn't say she's obese.

262
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,040
And look at the first comment on it.

263
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,580
We love that mid-sized representation.

264
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,060
What representation is there?

265
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,580
This isn't a piece of fictional media.

266
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,220
This isn't a career hiring or a school class.

267
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,120
This isn't a celebrity plying for eyeballs.

268
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
This is a regular person living a regular life, doing nothing out of the ordinary.

269
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,880
But now it's representation.

270
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,640
She doesn't have to be representative of anything other than herself.

271
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,260
And yet the commodification of identities has led people to credit her for something

272
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,780
she's not doing simply because she's in a photo.

273
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,140
Oh, by the way, every time you see that return to tradition shit, it's the rightoids trying

274
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,340
to adopt the same tactics.

275
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,500
They may be commodifying a different identity, one that appeals to rightoids, but it's the

276
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,100
same thing for the same reason.

277
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,300
Don't listen to any of them.

278
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,700
You should be doing whatever feels right for you, but more importantly, you should

279
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,420
be doing it in a humble way.

280
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,700
The Christians were onto something when there was an injunction to public prayer in their

281
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
religion.

282
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,740
Even they understood that virtue signaling was ultimately a vice, and I think it applies

283
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,740
here too.

284
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,860
This is why I don't think I'm transphobic and I don't accept the logic of the lefties

285
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,860
who claim that I am.

286
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,260
I don't hate trans people.

287
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,260
I don't want to see them exterminated.

288
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,900
I don't want to see them disappear.

289
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,220
I want to see them receive every bit of help they need.

290
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,100
And if there is some kind of government-run healthcare service in a given area, I think

291
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,440
trans people should have equal access to it in a way that meets their needs.

292
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,740
Same goes for non-binary people too.

293
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,620
I have to admit, on a personal level, I think I would find it hard to regularly use they-them

294
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,060
pronouns if I actually knew somebody who wanted me to.

295
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,700
I can feel that it wouldn't come natural to me, but I also know that I would at least

296
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,740
make an effort for the sake of that person because that's who I am.

297
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,500
But I will never accept the idea that I'm transphobic simply because I notice that some

298
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,320
people are bad and willing to hide behind the progressive sacred cow.

299
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,400
At this point, coming out announcements like this feel as self-indulgent as baby gender

300
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
reveal parties.

301
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,280
It's a way to call attention to yourself and your life that might work on some small

302
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,280
scale with, say, just your friends or your family, when it's appropriate.

303
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,080
But when it's done large scale, on an international stage, by a public figure, it just seems gaudy.

304
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,440
I don't care what gender Demi Lovato is.

305
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,960
That's their business, not mine.

306
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,400
But I'm not going to listen to people who tell me that my eyes are lying.

307
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,120
Transness is the newly commodified identity right now.

308
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,360
And while non-binary people most certainly exist, I suspect there's a lot of young people

309
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,760
who want to wave that trans flag for kudos right now, who are setting pronouns as a she-they

310
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,720
and writing long Twitter threads about their new journey of self-discovery, despite there

311
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,280
being no practical difference between them and your average cis woman, in much the same

312
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,800
way that so many bisexual women a decade ago never got with somebody of the same gender

313
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,640
and were never actually attracted to them either.

314
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,600
But hey, it made them look progressive on campus.

315
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
That shit made real bi women look bad.

316
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,320
It made lesbians look bad.

317
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,960
And I've now spoken to a number of trans people who feel that this current trend makes

318
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
them look bad.

319
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
I sympathize with them.

320
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,360
No matter what the progs say, I'm never going to actually be against trans people.

321
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,840
But if they expect me to acquiesce to their ideas that being pro-trans means not accepting

322
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,480
people who are clearly coming out disingenuously, they've got another thing coming.
