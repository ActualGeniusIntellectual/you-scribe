1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,900
Check out this fella here, Sam Brinton.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,620
I have some pretty big news to share with you all today.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,600
I've accepted the offer to serve as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Spent Fuel and

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,420
Waste Disposition in the Office of Nuclear Energy for the Department of Energy.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,300
Apparently he's qualified for the job, with a Bachelor of Science in Nuclear Engineering

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,900
and a Masters of Science in Nuclear Science.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,540
He is notable for developing a new type of nuclear fuel reprocessing, whereby nuclear

8
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,060
waste that would once be disposed of at a repository could be repurposed and reused,

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,940
cutting down on waste by 96%.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,320
He's also got a music degree, but I don't suppose he's going to be splitting atoms

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
with a singing voice.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,460
That's something that I do.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,160
However, he's also an LGBTQ activist, advocating against conversion therapy, something that

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,820
his rural parents put him through.

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,140
Oh, and he's also apparently gender fluid, which makes him a they actually.

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,140
Oops.

17
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,280
Don't ban me Susan, I'm trying to be good, but you know how it is.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,100
Not many women have that mustache.

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,940
I use they and them as my pronouns, and when someone uses they and them as my pronouns,

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,420
I feel like that person is listening to me.

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,300
That person cares about me, and that person wants to have a conversation with me.

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,000
Man, I'm never going to get used to that.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,340
Not the they them thing.

24
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,340
I'm actually fine with that.

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,960
I'm okay with he, she, and they.

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,600
They're part of the English language already, and not imposed upon the normies like neo-pronouns

27
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,420
or xeno-pronouns?

28
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,760
Neo-pronouns are any set of singular third-person pronouns that were directly created or adapted

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,540
within the language instead of evolving within it, and are frequently not officially recognized

30
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,540
in the language they're used in.

31
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,540
Yeah, here we go.

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,260
In English, there are four sets of recognized exy-pronouns.

33
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,340
She, her is considered feminine, he, him is considered masculine, and they, them is considered

34
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,380
neutral and less controversial than the fourth set, it, its.

35
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,660
Okay, so a neo-pronoun is anything like that ze, zer shit.

36
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,500
What I wanted to say before jumping down the pronouns wiki rabbit hole is I'm fine with

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,020
he, she, and they.

38
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,160
Not zee or anything else, because that's just an imposition on normally evolved language

39
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,580
for ideological reasons.

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,500
But even then, I still can't see myself getting on board with this type of introduction.

41
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,500
So when I introduce myself, I generally say, hi, my name's Sam Britten, I use they and

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,660
them as my pronouns, and I serve as head of advocacy and government affairs for the Trevor

43
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,660
Project.

44
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,940
It's beyond a political imposition on language, it's also just focusing on something unimportant.

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,300
It would seem to me that a more interesting component of Sam's personality is his work,

46
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
not his gender identity.

47
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,980
Things that companies and schools can do are, on the first day of classes, and from maybe

48
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,580
the first week, having a sticker where you tell people, hi, my name is Sam, my pronouns

49
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,580
are they and them.

50
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,060
Oh god, I would not be a good student in today's school environment.

51
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,340
I already caused my share of trouble back when things were more cavalier.

52
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,340
I can't imagine having to wear a Walmart greeter badge while in class.

53
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:52,020
But if I can have the President of the United States use my gender neutral pronouns, and

54
00:02:52,020 --> 00:03:00,620
I can respectfully use theirs, then I think we're going to be in a world where everyone

55
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,720
can be respected, and everyone has the responsibility to be respectful.

56
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,860
This is technically true, but the best counter to it is that gender is not only your own

57
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,620
self-perception, but how others perceive you.

58
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,300
A trans woman I know recently told me that she never told people her pronouns and never

59
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,260
tried to enforce anything on others.

60
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,220
She simply transitioned and fit in as a woman to the point that now the normies reflexively

61
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,180
call her she, and that seems to be how it works for most people.

62
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,540
Most people know what to call you by looking at you, and if everyone's calling you something

63
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,380
that doesn't align with your own self-perception, maybe the problem isn't actually the rest

64
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,380
of the world.

65
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,480
In any case, the internet has decided to focus less on Sam's credentials and more on the

66
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,480
cross-dressing element.

67
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,580
Dude, if you're going to do a mohawk, that's fine.

68
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,980
Just make it a straight mohawk, at least.

69
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,680
And then all that stuff came out about the puppy play.

70
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,720
Dog pilled again, I can't escape it.

71
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,480
Here's an article from 2016.

72
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,020
Puppy love from the pups to their handlers and the bonds they share.

73
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,240
An inside look at the increasingly popular leather subset.

74
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Oh god.

75
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,460
There's a lot of people in this article, but here's Sam's segment.

76
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,660
My headspace is equivalent to the mom who sees her kid in danger, or the dad who wants

77
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,800
to teach his son how to play football, says newbie's 27-year-old handler Sam.

78
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
It's the concept of the teacher and nurturer.

79
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,340
My job is to make sure that while he's in headspace, I'm keeping him safe.

80
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,020
That tail's a butt plug, isn't it?

81
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,840
But here's the bit that I found interesting.

82
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,200
One of the hardest things about being a handler is that I've honestly had people ask, wait,

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,500
you have sex with animals?

84
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,200
They believe it's abusive, that it's taking advantage of someone who may not be acting

85
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,340
up to a level of human responsibility.

86
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,340
The other misperception is that I have some really messed up background, like, did I have

87
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,500
some horrible childhood trauma that made me like to have sex with animals?

88
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,860
Sam, um, isn't it?

89
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,940
Isn't it by your own admission that you, in fact, did have horrible childhood trauma?

90
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,460
Not related to dogs, but certainly related to conversion therapy.

91
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,860
I have those feelings when I think of Dale, my best friend.

92
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,040
My dad just started punching.

93
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,920
That was the first day that I was sent to the emergency room because I'd fallen down

94
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
the stairs.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,400
Physical therapy was my hands being tied down and blocks of ice being placed on my hands.

96
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,520
Then pictures of men holding hands would be shown to me, so that way I would associate

97
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,560
the concept of the pain of ice with a man touching me.

98
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,320
It worked really, really, really well.

99
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,600
My dad could barely even hug me anymore when I would scream out in pain.

100
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,200
Then we went into heat, so coils would be wrapped around my hands and you'd be able

101
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,940
to turn the heat on or off.

102
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,620
So now if we had a picture of a guy and a girl hugging, it was no pain.

103
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,700
If there was a picture of a guy and a guy hugging, we had physical pain.

104
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,200
We then went into the month of hell.

105
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,340
The month of hell consisted of tiny needles being stuck into my fingers and then pictures

106
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,520
of explicit acts between men would be shown and I'd be electrocuted.

107
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,580
At this point, I was completely done.

108
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,180
God did not want me on this earth anymore.

109
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,400
So we lived on a three-story building.

110
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,200
I told my sister goodbye and I walked to the roof.

111
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,680
My mom finds me up on the roof, says, you know, she will love me again if I will just

112
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,180
change because my sister had tattled on me.

113
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,040
My mom's up there, you know, she'll love me again if I'll just change, which is not the

114
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,520
thing to say to a person standing on the edge of a building.

115
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,840
At this point, I'm a logical person again and it shines through.

116
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,580
This is only three stories and if I don't die, this is gonna hurt worse than the others.

117
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,080
So I run back into my mom's arms saying, you know what, I'm changed.

118
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,040
I came back out to my parents.

119
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:36,920
My mom and she didn't really know what to say anymore because she thought it had worked.

120
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,240
She told me that she would tell my dad because we didn't, I mean, we didn't want the same

121
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,760
situation to happen again.

122
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,860
I left for the afternoon.

123
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,700
I came back and my stuff was on the front door with it locked.

124
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,640
I've tried to call them multiple times.

125
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,320
My mom has answered the phone once or twice on her birthday or something saying, you know,

126
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
hi.

127
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,280
My mom has held a gun up to my head multiple times, but the last time I got on the phone

128
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,000
that he, I tried to keep calling.

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,280
I want, you know, I want contact was that he would, he would shoot me if I ever tried

130
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,400
to walk in the door again.

131
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,680
This does not sound like you had a happy home life, dude.

132
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,060
I don't see how you can square away your legitimate victimhood and of course your reaping of the

133
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,720
associated social credit in your new community with this idea that you're not traumatized

134
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,960
and you're completely normal and nothing's wrong here.

135
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,400
I've been an advocate for ending conversion therapy for a very long time now and state

136
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,160
after state after state after state are signing these laws as late as this week, right?

137
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,540
Like we are truly watching a watershed moment where the power of politics is no longer being

138
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,240
used to hurt me, but to help me.

139
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,480
I am proud to have just gotten married a few weeks ago.

140
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,600
The greatest screw you to conversion therapy known to mankind.

141
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:00,200
I walked down the aisle with a man who loved me as I am and who knew that I come with the

142
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:07,000
scars of conversion therapy, but also with the power and the pride that that will no

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,960
longer happen to another child on my watch.

144
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,440
At the end of the day, I don't actually care about what people do in the privacy of their

145
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
own bedrooms.

146
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,600
There is of course the fact that Sam doesn't keep it private.

147
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
This is in a bedroom.

148
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,600
This isn't a sex club.

149
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,720
It's a university lecture hall.

150
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,040
The difference between this guy and a Pete Buttigieg type who has a relatively normal

151
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,340
public life with his husband is night and day as far as I can tell.

152
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,700
It's the difference between a normal person who happens to be gay and someone who has

153
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,680
no personality other than their sexual preferences.

154
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,400
So they centered that topic every time they show up.

155
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,800
The right wing side of the internet focused on a few different facets of this story.

156
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,280
Some noticed that Sam's being used in Russian news to propagandize their own population

157
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,640
about the West decline.

158
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,740
Others pointed out that the rightest cries against cancel culture ring hollow when they

159
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,820
want to see Sam lose his job over something like this.

160
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
And yeah, fair enough.

161
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,860
But if rightists stop cancelling it doesn't mean that leftists are going to stop.

162
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,460
On some level it's just the bed you made.

163
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,800
Sargon's thesis over on Lotus Eaters revolved around the concept of BioLeninism.

164
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,100
The theory goes like this.

165
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,580
When the Leninists were getting together the rank and file revolutionaries in Russia, the

166
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,940
ones who would actually do the fighting and the looting and the smashing, they gathered

167
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,980
up people at the margins of society.

168
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,840
The bums, the drunks, the less successful people, the people who were bitter and angry

169
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,580
that the next guy over was getting ahead in life while they weren't.

170
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,860
And the excuse of workers' revolutionary fervor allowed them to enact the worst, most

171
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,600
horrific fantasies upon their neighbors, whom they falsely blamed for everything bad in

172
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,620
their lives.

173
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,320
The idea of BioLeninism is that rather than recruiting people from the economic margins

174
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,420
of society to attack the center, they would recruit people from the social and biological

175
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,420
margins.

176
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,420
Unattractive people, dysfunctional people, people with alternate sexualities, people

177
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,680
with low status, and this would be their coalition to fight the normies.

178
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,780
I think all of these ideas probably have a part in this conversation, but I also think

179
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,260
there's a missing component.

180
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,540
To be single and looking for a stable, functional relationship right now is pretty hellish,

181
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,540
not gonna lie.

182
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,460
The internet is full of examples of Tinder profiles where people are openly bragging

183
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,940
about their lack of virtue.

184
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,640
Twitch Thought Culture, and more recently OnlyFans Culture, has been exploiting the

185
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,060
loneliness of their viewers for some time now.

186
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,220
And if you're somebody who's looking for a relationship that is more normal, more stable,

187
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,440
more exclusive, at least in some places you're kind of viewed as weird nowadays.

188
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,960
A few days ago, an app hit the mainstream called The Right Stuff.

189
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,100
It's a conservative-focused dating app, and left-leaning news publications have decided

190
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,460
to attack the idea.

191
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,260
Peter Thiel to launch conservative dating app because no one wants to date Republicans.

192
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,520
And this article hits every single buzzword.

193
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,480
Racist, sexist, xenophobic, fascist, incels, nobody likes you, nobody wants to date you,

194
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,840
you're pathetic if you can't compete on regular apps.

195
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,800
You know, before we even get into the validity of this kind of thing, I have a feeling that

196
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,920
if a conservative wanted sex from a progressive, it would actually be pretty easy.

197
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,140
A philosophy based on sexual promiscuity and openness means all you have to do is keep

198
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,480
the MAGA hat off your head for a few hours.

199
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,640
The issue is, conservatives don't only want sex.

200
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,840
And the reason that progs are framing this conversation entirely around sex is because

201
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,760
they don't believe that anything else within the romantic sphere, let alone commitment,

202
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,200
can possibly have more value than coming.

203
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,440
Honestly, it just feels like the leftoids want the rightoids to disappear entirely.

204
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,220
They laugh when rightoids get banned off mainline platforms, but then they screech bloody murder

205
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,340
when rightoids go isolationist and try to go off on their own way and build their own

206
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,340
stuff.

207
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,500
It's kind of like how the MGTOW types get screamed at by feminists for literally disengaging

208
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
from the dating space.

209
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,700
It's not enough for them that you distance yourself.

210
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,140
You need to either comply and become absorbed by them or just disappear.

211
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,860
Your existence, even if isolated from them, is an insult in their eyes.

212
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,940
This comic here was making the rounds, which made me realize that these two topics, the

213
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,780
Biden dog boy and the conservative dating app, are actually part of the same thing.

214
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,080
The first panel is an incel angry at the world for his own failings, saying that women

215
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
owe me sex.

216
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,120
The second is an incel, who probably actually isn't an incel, but an average conservative

217
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,740
type guy who sees OnlyFans and says women are trash, presumably hyperbolically.

218
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,140
Not all women, just the subset who do that sort of thing.

219
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,460
And the third panel is very clearly not an incel at all, just a normie who is not into

220
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,460
a blue haired woman fucking a dog boy with a strap on.

221
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,580
My position personally is that I don't care what you do sexually, you can be as degenerate

222
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,420
as you want, just keep the not-safe-for-work stuff private.

223
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,420
It's probably the case that everyone's got some strangeness to their sexuality, because

224
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,460
real sex just isn't like porn, it's kinda goofy actually.

225
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,700
But the point is, there's no reason to publicize it.

226
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,100
Pride in your eccentricities isn't necessary.

227
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,420
Leather pup play is not an essential part of being gay.

228
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,460
Do what you want, assuming everyone involved consents, but understand that the people outside

229
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,940
your private life don't consent to see it, or know about it, so have some decorum.

230
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,000
Your entire life shouldn't revolve around your sexual fetishes.

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,600
But the push from the left doesn't seem to be about acceptance anymore.

232
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,480
Though it uses some of the same language that gay activists of 20 years ago used, when talking

233
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,520
about how they didn't actually want to turn other people gay, they just wanted to live

234
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,060
quiet private lives and not be accosted for it, a completely reasonable demand.

235
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,640
Now it's no longer about acceptance, but exclusion.

236
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,900
To many trans activists, and to the detriment of normal trans people, not being interested

237
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,500
in a trans woman because she has a dick is now transphobia, and any sort of mainstream

238
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,660
backlash against that push, like for example the super straight meme, must be considered

239
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,120
a hotbed of fascism.

240
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,460
A normie who isn't interested in public kink is now a bigot for that preference, and

241
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,400
he needs to be slandered with the label of incel because what an incel is, is no longer

242
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,580
just an involuntary celibate person, but rather it's a reactionary movement that seeks to

243
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,460
subjugate women and people of color because, well, why not.

244
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,780
And those conservatives who decide to disengage from these new sexual values and return to

245
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,440
their own romantic social structures are, yes you've heard it before, incels and bigots

246
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,240
and fascists and all the rest of it.

247
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,960
It's no longer about combating an intolerant right leaning society that has no place for

248
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,480
leftist sexual morality.

249
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
We did that.

250
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,520
That fight is largely over.

251
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,820
It's about making every possible place only a space for that leftist sexual morality,

252
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,100
to the exclusion of everything else.

253
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,860
Rightist sexual morality can't be allowed to coexist in their own spaces alongside leftist

254
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,180
sexual morality.

255
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,960
Everything needs to tilt towards them.

256
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,480
I have no problem with Sam Brinton doing the professional level job he's qualified to

257
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,800
I have no problem with his sexuality or gender identity.

258
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,120
I have no problem with what kinks he engages in, behind closed doors or within sexual oriented

259
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
environments.

260
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,600
It's not about him at all.

261
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,360
It's about the growing expectation that if you're not at least a little bit like him,

262
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,080
you're part of a mechanism that represses people like him.

263
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
I don't mean specifically.

264
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,680
You don't have to have his exact kinks.

265
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,240
But there's this growing idea within leftist spaces that if you're not completely open

266
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,200
and public about all aspects of your sexuality, you're a sad, repressed, self-flagellating

267
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,480
object of pity.

268
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
I don't buy it.

269
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,080
The much more likely result is that regardless of whether or not you have a sexual idiosyncrasy

270
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,080
of your own, you've also just got a sense of good taste.
