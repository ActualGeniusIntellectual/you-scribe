0	7900	Check out this fella here, Sam Brinton.
7900	10620	I have some pretty big news to share with you all today.
10620	14600	I've accepted the offer to serve as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Spent Fuel and
14600	18420	Waste Disposition in the Office of Nuclear Energy for the Department of Energy.
18420	22300	Apparently he's qualified for the job, with a Bachelor of Science in Nuclear Engineering
22300	24900	and a Masters of Science in Nuclear Science.
24900	29540	He is notable for developing a new type of nuclear fuel reprocessing, whereby nuclear
29580	34060	waste that would once be disposed of at a repository could be repurposed and reused,
34060	35940	cutting down on waste by 96%.
35940	39320	He's also got a music degree, but I don't suppose he's going to be splitting atoms
39320	40320	with a singing voice.
40320	41460	That's something that I do.
41460	46160	However, he's also an LGBTQ activist, advocating against conversion therapy, something that
46160	47820	his rural parents put him through.
47820	51140	Oh, and he's also apparently gender fluid, which makes him a they actually.
51140	52140	Oops.
52140	54280	Don't ban me Susan, I'm trying to be good, but you know how it is.
54280	56100	Not many women have that mustache.
56100	63940	I use they and them as my pronouns, and when someone uses they and them as my pronouns,
63940	66420	I feel like that person is listening to me.
66420	70300	That person cares about me, and that person wants to have a conversation with me.
70300	72000	Man, I'm never going to get used to that.
72000	73340	Not the they them thing.
73340	74340	I'm actually fine with that.
74340	75960	I'm okay with he, she, and they.
75960	80600	They're part of the English language already, and not imposed upon the normies like neo-pronouns
80600	83420	or xeno-pronouns?
83420	87760	Neo-pronouns are any set of singular third-person pronouns that were directly created or adapted
87760	91540	within the language instead of evolving within it, and are frequently not officially recognized
91540	92540	in the language they're used in.
92540	93540	Yeah, here we go.
93540	96260	In English, there are four sets of recognized exy-pronouns.
96260	101340	She, her is considered feminine, he, him is considered masculine, and they, them is considered
101340	104380	neutral and less controversial than the fourth set, it, its.
104380	107660	Okay, so a neo-pronoun is anything like that ze, zer shit.
107660	111500	What I wanted to say before jumping down the pronouns wiki rabbit hole is I'm fine with
111500	113020	he, she, and they.
113020	117160	Not zee or anything else, because that's just an imposition on normally evolved language
117160	118580	for ideological reasons.
118580	122500	But even then, I still can't see myself getting on board with this type of introduction.
122500	126500	So when I introduce myself, I generally say, hi, my name's Sam Britten, I use they and
126500	130660	them as my pronouns, and I serve as head of advocacy and government affairs for the Trevor
130660	131660	Project.
131660	135940	It's beyond a political imposition on language, it's also just focusing on something unimportant.
135940	140300	It would seem to me that a more interesting component of Sam's personality is his work,
140300	141300	not his gender identity.
141300	146980	Things that companies and schools can do are, on the first day of classes, and from maybe
146980	153580	the first week, having a sticker where you tell people, hi, my name is Sam, my pronouns
153580	154580	are they and them.
154580	158060	Oh god, I would not be a good student in today's school environment.
158060	161340	I already caused my share of trouble back when things were more cavalier.
161340	165340	I can't imagine having to wear a Walmart greeter badge while in class.
165340	172020	But if I can have the President of the United States use my gender neutral pronouns, and
172020	180620	I can respectfully use theirs, then I think we're going to be in a world where everyone
180620	187720	can be respected, and everyone has the responsibility to be respectful.
187720	191860	This is technically true, but the best counter to it is that gender is not only your own
191860	194620	self-perception, but how others perceive you.
194620	198300	A trans woman I know recently told me that she never told people her pronouns and never
198300	200260	tried to enforce anything on others.
200260	204220	She simply transitioned and fit in as a woman to the point that now the normies reflexively
204220	208180	call her she, and that seems to be how it works for most people.
208180	211540	Most people know what to call you by looking at you, and if everyone's calling you something
211540	215380	that doesn't align with your own self-perception, maybe the problem isn't actually the rest
215380	216380	of the world.
216380	220480	In any case, the internet has decided to focus less on Sam's credentials and more on the
220480	221480	cross-dressing element.
221480	223580	Dude, if you're going to do a mohawk, that's fine.
223580	225980	Just make it a straight mohawk, at least.
225980	228680	And then all that stuff came out about the puppy play.
228680	230720	Dog pilled again, I can't escape it.
230720	232480	Here's an article from 2016.
232480	236020	Puppy love from the pups to their handlers and the bonds they share.
236020	239240	An inside look at the increasingly popular leather subset.
239240	240240	Oh god.
240240	243460	There's a lot of people in this article, but here's Sam's segment.
243460	247660	My headspace is equivalent to the mom who sees her kid in danger, or the dad who wants
247660	252800	to teach his son how to play football, says newbie's 27-year-old handler Sam.
252800	254800	It's the concept of the teacher and nurturer.
254800	259340	My job is to make sure that while he's in headspace, I'm keeping him safe.
259340	261020	That tail's a butt plug, isn't it?
261020	262840	But here's the bit that I found interesting.
262840	267200	One of the hardest things about being a handler is that I've honestly had people ask, wait,
267200	268500	you have sex with animals?
268500	272200	They believe it's abusive, that it's taking advantage of someone who may not be acting
272200	274340	up to a level of human responsibility.
274340	278340	The other misperception is that I have some really messed up background, like, did I have
278340	282500	some horrible childhood trauma that made me like to have sex with animals?
282500	284860	Sam, um, isn't it?
284860	289940	Isn't it by your own admission that you, in fact, did have horrible childhood trauma?
289940	292460	Not related to dogs, but certainly related to conversion therapy.
292460	295860	I have those feelings when I think of Dale, my best friend.
295860	298040	My dad just started punching.
298040	302920	That was the first day that I was sent to the emergency room because I'd fallen down
302920	303920	the stairs.
304000	310400	Physical therapy was my hands being tied down and blocks of ice being placed on my hands.
310400	314520	Then pictures of men holding hands would be shown to me, so that way I would associate
314520	319560	the concept of the pain of ice with a man touching me.
319560	321320	It worked really, really, really well.
321320	324600	My dad could barely even hug me anymore when I would scream out in pain.
324600	329200	Then we went into heat, so coils would be wrapped around my hands and you'd be able
329200	330940	to turn the heat on or off.
330940	334620	So now if we had a picture of a guy and a girl hugging, it was no pain.
334620	337700	If there was a picture of a guy and a guy hugging, we had physical pain.
337700	341200	We then went into the month of hell.
341200	347340	The month of hell consisted of tiny needles being stuck into my fingers and then pictures
347340	350520	of explicit acts between men would be shown and I'd be electrocuted.
350520	352580	At this point, I was completely done.
352580	355180	God did not want me on this earth anymore.
355180	356400	So we lived on a three-story building.
356400	360200	I told my sister goodbye and I walked to the roof.
360200	365680	My mom finds me up on the roof, says, you know, she will love me again if I will just
365680	368180	change because my sister had tattled on me.
368180	373040	My mom's up there, you know, she'll love me again if I'll just change, which is not the
373040	376520	thing to say to a person standing on the edge of a building.
376520	379840	At this point, I'm a logical person again and it shines through.
379840	383580	This is only three stories and if I don't die, this is gonna hurt worse than the others.
383580	388080	So I run back into my mom's arms saying, you know what, I'm changed.
388080	390040	I came back out to my parents.
390040	396920	My mom and she didn't really know what to say anymore because she thought it had worked.
396920	400240	She told me that she would tell my dad because we didn't, I mean, we didn't want the same
400240	401760	situation to happen again.
401760	403860	I left for the afternoon.
403860	408700	I came back and my stuff was on the front door with it locked.
408700	410640	I've tried to call them multiple times.
410640	416320	My mom has answered the phone once or twice on her birthday or something saying, you know,
416320	417320	hi.
417320	422280	My mom has held a gun up to my head multiple times, but the last time I got on the phone
422280	424000	that he, I tried to keep calling.
424000	429280	I want, you know, I want contact was that he would, he would shoot me if I ever tried
429280	430400	to walk in the door again.
430400	432680	This does not sound like you had a happy home life, dude.
432680	437060	I don't see how you can square away your legitimate victimhood and of course your reaping of the
437060	441720	associated social credit in your new community with this idea that you're not traumatized
441720	443960	and you're completely normal and nothing's wrong here.
443960	449400	I've been an advocate for ending conversion therapy for a very long time now and state
449400	455160	after state after state after state are signing these laws as late as this week, right?
455160	462540	Like we are truly watching a watershed moment where the power of politics is no longer being
462540	465240	used to hurt me, but to help me.
465240	468480	I am proud to have just gotten married a few weeks ago.
468480	472600	The greatest screw you to conversion therapy known to mankind.
472600	480200	I walked down the aisle with a man who loved me as I am and who knew that I come with the
480200	487000	scars of conversion therapy, but also with the power and the pride that that will no
487000	489960	longer happen to another child on my watch.
489960	493440	At the end of the day, I don't actually care about what people do in the privacy of their
493440	494440	own bedrooms.
494440	496600	There is of course the fact that Sam doesn't keep it private.
496600	497600	This is in a bedroom.
497600	498600	This isn't a sex club.
498600	499720	It's a university lecture hall.
499720	503040	The difference between this guy and a Pete Buttigieg type who has a relatively normal
503040	506340	public life with his husband is night and day as far as I can tell.
506340	509700	It's the difference between a normal person who happens to be gay and someone who has
509700	512680	no personality other than their sexual preferences.
512680	515400	So they centered that topic every time they show up.
515400	518800	The right wing side of the internet focused on a few different facets of this story.
518800	523280	Some noticed that Sam's being used in Russian news to propagandize their own population
523280	524640	about the West decline.
524640	528740	Others pointed out that the rightest cries against cancel culture ring hollow when they
528740	531820	want to see Sam lose his job over something like this.
531820	532820	And yeah, fair enough.
532820	535860	But if rightists stop cancelling it doesn't mean that leftists are going to stop.
535860	537460	On some level it's just the bed you made.
537460	541800	Sargon's thesis over on Lotus Eaters revolved around the concept of BioLeninism.
541800	543100	The theory goes like this.
543100	546580	When the Leninists were getting together the rank and file revolutionaries in Russia, the
546580	549940	ones who would actually do the fighting and the looting and the smashing, they gathered
549940	551980	up people at the margins of society.
551980	555840	The bums, the drunks, the less successful people, the people who were bitter and angry
555840	558580	that the next guy over was getting ahead in life while they weren't.
558580	562860	And the excuse of workers' revolutionary fervor allowed them to enact the worst, most
562860	566600	horrific fantasies upon their neighbors, whom they falsely blamed for everything bad in
566600	567620	their lives.
567620	572320	The idea of BioLeninism is that rather than recruiting people from the economic margins
572320	576420	of society to attack the center, they would recruit people from the social and biological
576420	577420	margins.
577420	580420	Unattractive people, dysfunctional people, people with alternate sexualities, people
580420	583680	with low status, and this would be their coalition to fight the normies.
583680	587780	I think all of these ideas probably have a part in this conversation, but I also think
587780	589260	there's a missing component.
589260	593540	To be single and looking for a stable, functional relationship right now is pretty hellish,
593540	594540	not gonna lie.
594540	598460	The internet is full of examples of Tinder profiles where people are openly bragging
598460	599940	about their lack of virtue.
599940	603640	Twitch Thought Culture, and more recently OnlyFans Culture, has been exploiting the
603640	606060	loneliness of their viewers for some time now.
606060	610220	And if you're somebody who's looking for a relationship that is more normal, more stable,
610220	614440	more exclusive, at least in some places you're kind of viewed as weird nowadays.
614440	617960	A few days ago, an app hit the mainstream called The Right Stuff.
617960	622100	It's a conservative-focused dating app, and left-leaning news publications have decided
622100	623460	to attack the idea.
623460	627260	Peter Thiel to launch conservative dating app because no one wants to date Republicans.
627260	629520	And this article hits every single buzzword.
629520	634480	Racist, sexist, xenophobic, fascist, incels, nobody likes you, nobody wants to date you,
634480	636840	you're pathetic if you can't compete on regular apps.
636840	640800	You know, before we even get into the validity of this kind of thing, I have a feeling that
640800	643920	if a conservative wanted sex from a progressive, it would actually be pretty easy.
643920	648140	A philosophy based on sexual promiscuity and openness means all you have to do is keep
648140	650480	the MAGA hat off your head for a few hours.
650480	653640	The issue is, conservatives don't only want sex.
653640	657840	And the reason that progs are framing this conversation entirely around sex is because
657840	661760	they don't believe that anything else within the romantic sphere, let alone commitment,
661760	664200	can possibly have more value than coming.
664200	668440	Honestly, it just feels like the leftoids want the rightoids to disappear entirely.
668440	673220	They laugh when rightoids get banned off mainline platforms, but then they screech bloody murder
673220	677340	when rightoids go isolationist and try to go off on their own way and build their own
677340	678340	stuff.
678340	682500	It's kind of like how the MGTOW types get screamed at by feminists for literally disengaging
682500	683500	from the dating space.
683500	685700	It's not enough for them that you distance yourself.
685700	690140	You need to either comply and become absorbed by them or just disappear.
690140	694860	Your existence, even if isolated from them, is an insult in their eyes.
694860	698940	This comic here was making the rounds, which made me realize that these two topics, the
698940	702780	Biden dog boy and the conservative dating app, are actually part of the same thing.
702780	706080	The first panel is an incel angry at the world for his own failings, saying that women
706080	707080	owe me sex.
707080	711120	The second is an incel, who probably actually isn't an incel, but an average conservative
711120	715740	type guy who sees OnlyFans and says women are trash, presumably hyperbolically.
715740	718140	Not all women, just the subset who do that sort of thing.
718140	722460	And the third panel is very clearly not an incel at all, just a normie who is not into
722460	725460	a blue haired woman fucking a dog boy with a strap on.
725460	728580	My position personally is that I don't care what you do sexually, you can be as degenerate
728580	731420	as you want, just keep the not-safe-for-work stuff private.
731700	735420	It's probably the case that everyone's got some strangeness to their sexuality, because
735420	738460	real sex just isn't like porn, it's kinda goofy actually.
738460	740700	But the point is, there's no reason to publicize it.
740700	743100	Pride in your eccentricities isn't necessary.
743100	746420	Leather pup play is not an essential part of being gay.
746420	750460	Do what you want, assuming everyone involved consents, but understand that the people outside
750460	754940	your private life don't consent to see it, or know about it, so have some decorum.
754940	758000	Your entire life shouldn't revolve around your sexual fetishes.
758000	761600	But the push from the left doesn't seem to be about acceptance anymore.
761600	766480	Though it uses some of the same language that gay activists of 20 years ago used, when talking
766480	769520	about how they didn't actually want to turn other people gay, they just wanted to live
769520	774060	quiet private lives and not be accosted for it, a completely reasonable demand.
774060	776640	Now it's no longer about acceptance, but exclusion.
776640	780900	To many trans activists, and to the detriment of normal trans people, not being interested
780900	785500	in a trans woman because she has a dick is now transphobia, and any sort of mainstream
785500	789660	backlash against that push, like for example the super straight meme, must be considered
789660	791120	a hotbed of fascism.
791120	795460	A normie who isn't interested in public kink is now a bigot for that preference, and
795460	799400	he needs to be slandered with the label of incel because what an incel is, is no longer
799400	803580	just an involuntary celibate person, but rather it's a reactionary movement that seeks to
803580	806460	subjugate women and people of color because, well, why not.
806460	810780	And those conservatives who decide to disengage from these new sexual values and return to
810780	815440	their own romantic social structures are, yes you've heard it before, incels and bigots
815440	817240	and fascists and all the rest of it.
817240	821960	It's no longer about combating an intolerant right leaning society that has no place for
821960	823480	leftist sexual morality.
823480	824480	We did that.
824480	825520	That fight is largely over.
825520	830820	It's about making every possible place only a space for that leftist sexual morality,
830820	833100	to the exclusion of everything else.
833100	837860	Rightist sexual morality can't be allowed to coexist in their own spaces alongside leftist
837860	839180	sexual morality.
839180	840960	Everything needs to tilt towards them.
840960	844480	I have no problem with Sam Brinton doing the professional level job he's qualified to
844520	846800	I have no problem with his sexuality or gender identity.
846800	852120	I have no problem with what kinks he engages in, behind closed doors or within sexual oriented
852120	853120	environments.
853120	854600	It's not about him at all.
854600	858360	It's about the growing expectation that if you're not at least a little bit like him,
858360	861080	you're part of a mechanism that represses people like him.
861080	862080	I don't mean specifically.
862080	863680	You don't have to have his exact kinks.
863680	867240	But there's this growing idea within leftist spaces that if you're not completely open
