00:00.000 --> 00:07.900
Check out this fella here, Sam Brinton.

00:07.900 --> 00:10.620
I have some pretty big news to share with you all today.

00:10.620 --> 00:14.600
I've accepted the offer to serve as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Spent Fuel and

00:14.600 --> 00:18.420
Waste Disposition in the Office of Nuclear Energy for the Department of Energy.

00:18.420 --> 00:22.300
Apparently he's qualified for the job, with a Bachelor of Science in Nuclear Engineering

00:22.300 --> 00:24.900
and a Masters of Science in Nuclear Science.

00:24.900 --> 00:29.540
He is notable for developing a new type of nuclear fuel reprocessing, whereby nuclear

00:29.580 --> 00:34.060
waste that would once be disposed of at a repository could be repurposed and reused,

00:34.060 --> 00:35.940
cutting down on waste by 96%.

00:35.940 --> 00:39.320
He's also got a music degree, but I don't suppose he's going to be splitting atoms

00:39.320 --> 00:40.320
with a singing voice.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.460
That's something that I do.

00:41.460 --> 00:46.160
However, he's also an LGBTQ activist, advocating against conversion therapy, something that

00:46.160 --> 00:47.820
his rural parents put him through.

00:47.820 --> 00:51.140
Oh, and he's also apparently gender fluid, which makes him a they actually.

00:51.140 --> 00:52.140
Oops.

00:52.140 --> 00:54.280
Don't ban me Susan, I'm trying to be good, but you know how it is.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.100
Not many women have that mustache.

00:56.100 --> 01:03.940
I use they and them as my pronouns, and when someone uses they and them as my pronouns,

01:03.940 --> 01:06.420
I feel like that person is listening to me.

01:06.420 --> 01:10.300
That person cares about me, and that person wants to have a conversation with me.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.000
Man, I'm never going to get used to that.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.340
Not the they them thing.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.340
I'm actually fine with that.

01:14.340 --> 01:15.960
I'm okay with he, she, and they.

01:15.960 --> 01:20.600
They're part of the English language already, and not imposed upon the normies like neo-pronouns

01:20.600 --> 01:23.420
or xeno-pronouns?

01:23.420 --> 01:27.760
Neo-pronouns are any set of singular third-person pronouns that were directly created or adapted

01:27.760 --> 01:31.540
within the language instead of evolving within it, and are frequently not officially recognized

01:31.540 --> 01:32.540
in the language they're used in.

01:32.540 --> 01:33.540
Yeah, here we go.

01:33.540 --> 01:36.260
In English, there are four sets of recognized exy-pronouns.

01:36.260 --> 01:41.340
She, her is considered feminine, he, him is considered masculine, and they, them is considered

01:41.340 --> 01:44.380
neutral and less controversial than the fourth set, it, its.

01:44.380 --> 01:47.660
Okay, so a neo-pronoun is anything like that ze, zer shit.

01:47.660 --> 01:51.500
What I wanted to say before jumping down the pronouns wiki rabbit hole is I'm fine with

01:51.500 --> 01:53.020
he, she, and they.

01:53.020 --> 01:57.160
Not zee or anything else, because that's just an imposition on normally evolved language

01:57.160 --> 01:58.580
for ideological reasons.

01:58.580 --> 02:02.500
But even then, I still can't see myself getting on board with this type of introduction.

02:02.500 --> 02:06.500
So when I introduce myself, I generally say, hi, my name's Sam Britten, I use they and

02:06.500 --> 02:10.660
them as my pronouns, and I serve as head of advocacy and government affairs for the Trevor

02:10.660 --> 02:11.660
Project.

02:11.660 --> 02:15.940
It's beyond a political imposition on language, it's also just focusing on something unimportant.

02:15.940 --> 02:20.300
It would seem to me that a more interesting component of Sam's personality is his work,

02:20.300 --> 02:21.300
not his gender identity.

02:21.300 --> 02:26.980
Things that companies and schools can do are, on the first day of classes, and from maybe

02:26.980 --> 02:33.580
the first week, having a sticker where you tell people, hi, my name is Sam, my pronouns

02:33.580 --> 02:34.580
are they and them.

02:34.580 --> 02:38.060
Oh god, I would not be a good student in today's school environment.

02:38.060 --> 02:41.340
I already caused my share of trouble back when things were more cavalier.

02:41.340 --> 02:45.340
I can't imagine having to wear a Walmart greeter badge while in class.

02:45.340 --> 02:52.020
But if I can have the President of the United States use my gender neutral pronouns, and

02:52.020 --> 03:00.620
I can respectfully use theirs, then I think we're going to be in a world where everyone

03:00.620 --> 03:07.720
can be respected, and everyone has the responsibility to be respectful.

03:07.720 --> 03:11.860
This is technically true, but the best counter to it is that gender is not only your own

03:11.860 --> 03:14.620
self-perception, but how others perceive you.

03:14.620 --> 03:18.300
A trans woman I know recently told me that she never told people her pronouns and never

03:18.300 --> 03:20.260
tried to enforce anything on others.

03:20.260 --> 03:24.220
She simply transitioned and fit in as a woman to the point that now the normies reflexively

03:24.220 --> 03:28.180
call her she, and that seems to be how it works for most people.

03:28.180 --> 03:31.540
Most people know what to call you by looking at you, and if everyone's calling you something

03:31.540 --> 03:35.380
that doesn't align with your own self-perception, maybe the problem isn't actually the rest

03:35.380 --> 03:36.380
of the world.

03:36.380 --> 03:40.480
In any case, the internet has decided to focus less on Sam's credentials and more on the

03:40.480 --> 03:41.480
cross-dressing element.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.580
Dude, if you're going to do a mohawk, that's fine.

03:43.580 --> 03:45.980
Just make it a straight mohawk, at least.

03:45.980 --> 03:48.680
And then all that stuff came out about the puppy play.

03:48.680 --> 03:50.720
Dog pilled again, I can't escape it.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.480
Here's an article from 2016.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.020
Puppy love from the pups to their handlers and the bonds they share.

03:56.020 --> 03:59.240
An inside look at the increasingly popular leather subset.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.240
Oh god.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.460
There's a lot of people in this article, but here's Sam's segment.

04:03.460 --> 04:07.660
My headspace is equivalent to the mom who sees her kid in danger, or the dad who wants

04:07.660 --> 04:12.800
to teach his son how to play football, says newbie's 27-year-old handler Sam.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.800
It's the concept of the teacher and nurturer.

04:14.800 --> 04:19.340
My job is to make sure that while he's in headspace, I'm keeping him safe.

04:19.340 --> 04:21.020
That tail's a butt plug, isn't it?

04:21.020 --> 04:22.840
But here's the bit that I found interesting.

04:22.840 --> 04:27.200
One of the hardest things about being a handler is that I've honestly had people ask, wait,

04:27.200 --> 04:28.500
you have sex with animals?

04:28.500 --> 04:32.200
They believe it's abusive, that it's taking advantage of someone who may not be acting

04:32.200 --> 04:34.340
up to a level of human responsibility.

04:34.340 --> 04:38.340
The other misperception is that I have some really messed up background, like, did I have

04:38.340 --> 04:42.500
some horrible childhood trauma that made me like to have sex with animals?

04:42.500 --> 04:44.860
Sam, um, isn't it?

04:44.860 --> 04:49.940
Isn't it by your own admission that you, in fact, did have horrible childhood trauma?

04:49.940 --> 04:52.460
Not related to dogs, but certainly related to conversion therapy.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.860
I have those feelings when I think of Dale, my best friend.

04:55.860 --> 04:58.040
My dad just started punching.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.920
That was the first day that I was sent to the emergency room because I'd fallen down

05:02.920 --> 05:03.920
the stairs.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.400
Physical therapy was my hands being tied down and blocks of ice being placed on my hands.

05:10.400 --> 05:14.520
Then pictures of men holding hands would be shown to me, so that way I would associate

05:14.520 --> 05:19.560
the concept of the pain of ice with a man touching me.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.320
It worked really, really, really well.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.600
My dad could barely even hug me anymore when I would scream out in pain.

05:24.600 --> 05:29.200
Then we went into heat, so coils would be wrapped around my hands and you'd be able

05:29.200 --> 05:30.940
to turn the heat on or off.

05:30.940 --> 05:34.620
So now if we had a picture of a guy and a girl hugging, it was no pain.

05:34.620 --> 05:37.700
If there was a picture of a guy and a guy hugging, we had physical pain.

05:37.700 --> 05:41.200
We then went into the month of hell.

05:41.200 --> 05:47.340
The month of hell consisted of tiny needles being stuck into my fingers and then pictures

05:47.340 --> 05:50.520
of explicit acts between men would be shown and I'd be electrocuted.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.580
At this point, I was completely done.

05:52.580 --> 05:55.180
God did not want me on this earth anymore.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.400
So we lived on a three-story building.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.200
I told my sister goodbye and I walked to the roof.

06:00.200 --> 06:05.680
My mom finds me up on the roof, says, you know, she will love me again if I will just

06:05.680 --> 06:08.180
change because my sister had tattled on me.

06:08.180 --> 06:13.040
My mom's up there, you know, she'll love me again if I'll just change, which is not the

06:13.040 --> 06:16.520
thing to say to a person standing on the edge of a building.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.840
At this point, I'm a logical person again and it shines through.

06:19.840 --> 06:23.580
This is only three stories and if I don't die, this is gonna hurt worse than the others.

06:23.580 --> 06:28.080
So I run back into my mom's arms saying, you know what, I'm changed.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.040
I came back out to my parents.

06:30.040 --> 06:36.920
My mom and she didn't really know what to say anymore because she thought it had worked.

06:36.920 --> 06:40.240
She told me that she would tell my dad because we didn't, I mean, we didn't want the same

06:40.240 --> 06:41.760
situation to happen again.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.860
I left for the afternoon.

06:43.860 --> 06:48.700
I came back and my stuff was on the front door with it locked.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.640
I've tried to call them multiple times.

06:50.640 --> 06:56.320
My mom has answered the phone once or twice on her birthday or something saying, you know,

06:56.320 --> 06:57.320
hi.

06:57.320 --> 07:02.280
My mom has held a gun up to my head multiple times, but the last time I got on the phone

07:02.280 --> 07:04.000
that he, I tried to keep calling.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.280
I want, you know, I want contact was that he would, he would shoot me if I ever tried

07:09.280 --> 07:10.400
to walk in the door again.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.680
This does not sound like you had a happy home life, dude.

07:12.680 --> 07:17.060
I don't see how you can square away your legitimate victimhood and of course your reaping of the

07:17.060 --> 07:21.720
associated social credit in your new community with this idea that you're not traumatized

07:21.720 --> 07:23.960
and you're completely normal and nothing's wrong here.

07:23.960 --> 07:29.400
I've been an advocate for ending conversion therapy for a very long time now and state

07:29.400 --> 07:35.160
after state after state after state are signing these laws as late as this week, right?

07:35.160 --> 07:42.540
Like we are truly watching a watershed moment where the power of politics is no longer being

07:42.540 --> 07:45.240
used to hurt me, but to help me.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.480
I am proud to have just gotten married a few weeks ago.

07:48.480 --> 07:52.600
The greatest screw you to conversion therapy known to mankind.

07:52.600 --> 08:00.200
I walked down the aisle with a man who loved me as I am and who knew that I come with the

08:00.200 --> 08:07.000
scars of conversion therapy, but also with the power and the pride that that will no

08:07.000 --> 08:09.960
longer happen to another child on my watch.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.440
At the end of the day, I don't actually care about what people do in the privacy of their

08:13.440 --> 08:14.440
own bedrooms.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.600
There is of course the fact that Sam doesn't keep it private.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.600
This is in a bedroom.

08:17.600 --> 08:18.600
This isn't a sex club.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.720
It's a university lecture hall.

08:19.720 --> 08:23.040
The difference between this guy and a Pete Buttigieg type who has a relatively normal

08:23.040 --> 08:26.340
public life with his husband is night and day as far as I can tell.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.700
It's the difference between a normal person who happens to be gay and someone who has

08:29.700 --> 08:32.680
no personality other than their sexual preferences.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.400
So they centered that topic every time they show up.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.800
The right wing side of the internet focused on a few different facets of this story.

08:38.800 --> 08:43.280
Some noticed that Sam's being used in Russian news to propagandize their own population

08:43.280 --> 08:44.640
about the West decline.

08:44.640 --> 08:48.740
Others pointed out that the rightest cries against cancel culture ring hollow when they

08:48.740 --> 08:51.820
want to see Sam lose his job over something like this.

08:51.820 --> 08:52.820
And yeah, fair enough.

08:52.820 --> 08:55.860
But if rightists stop cancelling it doesn't mean that leftists are going to stop.

08:55.860 --> 08:57.460
On some level it's just the bed you made.

08:57.460 --> 09:01.800
Sargon's thesis over on Lotus Eaters revolved around the concept of BioLeninism.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.100
The theory goes like this.

09:03.100 --> 09:06.580
When the Leninists were getting together the rank and file revolutionaries in Russia, the

09:06.580 --> 09:09.940
ones who would actually do the fighting and the looting and the smashing, they gathered

09:09.940 --> 09:11.980
up people at the margins of society.

09:11.980 --> 09:15.840
The bums, the drunks, the less successful people, the people who were bitter and angry

09:15.840 --> 09:18.580
that the next guy over was getting ahead in life while they weren't.

09:18.580 --> 09:22.860
And the excuse of workers' revolutionary fervor allowed them to enact the worst, most

09:22.860 --> 09:26.600
horrific fantasies upon their neighbors, whom they falsely blamed for everything bad in

09:26.600 --> 09:27.620
their lives.

09:27.620 --> 09:32.320
The idea of BioLeninism is that rather than recruiting people from the economic margins

09:32.320 --> 09:36.420
of society to attack the center, they would recruit people from the social and biological

09:36.420 --> 09:37.420
margins.

09:37.420 --> 09:40.420
Unattractive people, dysfunctional people, people with alternate sexualities, people

09:40.420 --> 09:43.680
with low status, and this would be their coalition to fight the normies.

09:43.680 --> 09:47.780
I think all of these ideas probably have a part in this conversation, but I also think

09:47.780 --> 09:49.260
there's a missing component.

09:49.260 --> 09:53.540
To be single and looking for a stable, functional relationship right now is pretty hellish,

09:53.540 --> 09:54.540
not gonna lie.

09:54.540 --> 09:58.460
The internet is full of examples of Tinder profiles where people are openly bragging

09:58.460 --> 09:59.940
about their lack of virtue.

09:59.940 --> 10:03.640
Twitch Thought Culture, and more recently OnlyFans Culture, has been exploiting the

10:03.640 --> 10:06.060
loneliness of their viewers for some time now.

10:06.060 --> 10:10.220
And if you're somebody who's looking for a relationship that is more normal, more stable,

10:10.220 --> 10:14.440
more exclusive, at least in some places you're kind of viewed as weird nowadays.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.960
A few days ago, an app hit the mainstream called The Right Stuff.

10:17.960 --> 10:22.100
It's a conservative-focused dating app, and left-leaning news publications have decided

10:22.100 --> 10:23.460
to attack the idea.

10:23.460 --> 10:27.260
Peter Thiel to launch conservative dating app because no one wants to date Republicans.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.520
And this article hits every single buzzword.

10:29.520 --> 10:34.480
Racist, sexist, xenophobic, fascist, incels, nobody likes you, nobody wants to date you,

10:34.480 --> 10:36.840
you're pathetic if you can't compete on regular apps.

10:36.840 --> 10:40.800
You know, before we even get into the validity of this kind of thing, I have a feeling that

10:40.800 --> 10:43.920
if a conservative wanted sex from a progressive, it would actually be pretty easy.

10:43.920 --> 10:48.140
A philosophy based on sexual promiscuity and openness means all you have to do is keep

10:48.140 --> 10:50.480
the MAGA hat off your head for a few hours.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.640
The issue is, conservatives don't only want sex.

10:53.640 --> 10:57.840
And the reason that progs are framing this conversation entirely around sex is because

10:57.840 --> 11:01.760
they don't believe that anything else within the romantic sphere, let alone commitment,

11:01.760 --> 11:04.200
can possibly have more value than coming.

11:04.200 --> 11:08.440
Honestly, it just feels like the leftoids want the rightoids to disappear entirely.

11:08.440 --> 11:13.220
They laugh when rightoids get banned off mainline platforms, but then they screech bloody murder

11:13.220 --> 11:17.340
when rightoids go isolationist and try to go off on their own way and build their own

11:17.340 --> 11:18.340
stuff.

11:18.340 --> 11:22.500
It's kind of like how the MGTOW types get screamed at by feminists for literally disengaging

11:22.500 --> 11:23.500
from the dating space.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.700
It's not enough for them that you distance yourself.

11:25.700 --> 11:30.140
You need to either comply and become absorbed by them or just disappear.

11:30.140 --> 11:34.860
Your existence, even if isolated from them, is an insult in their eyes.

11:34.860 --> 11:38.940
This comic here was making the rounds, which made me realize that these two topics, the

11:38.940 --> 11:42.780
Biden dog boy and the conservative dating app, are actually part of the same thing.

11:42.780 --> 11:46.080
The first panel is an incel angry at the world for his own failings, saying that women

11:46.080 --> 11:47.080
owe me sex.

11:47.080 --> 11:51.120
The second is an incel, who probably actually isn't an incel, but an average conservative

11:51.120 --> 11:55.740
type guy who sees OnlyFans and says women are trash, presumably hyperbolically.

11:55.740 --> 11:58.140
Not all women, just the subset who do that sort of thing.

11:58.140 --> 12:02.460
And the third panel is very clearly not an incel at all, just a normie who is not into

12:02.460 --> 12:05.460
a blue haired woman fucking a dog boy with a strap on.

12:05.460 --> 12:08.580
My position personally is that I don't care what you do sexually, you can be as degenerate

12:08.580 --> 12:11.420
as you want, just keep the not-safe-for-work stuff private.

12:11.700 --> 12:15.420
It's probably the case that everyone's got some strangeness to their sexuality, because

12:15.420 --> 12:18.460
real sex just isn't like porn, it's kinda goofy actually.

12:18.460 --> 12:20.700
But the point is, there's no reason to publicize it.

12:20.700 --> 12:23.100
Pride in your eccentricities isn't necessary.

12:23.100 --> 12:26.420
Leather pup play is not an essential part of being gay.

12:26.420 --> 12:30.460
Do what you want, assuming everyone involved consents, but understand that the people outside

12:30.460 --> 12:34.940
your private life don't consent to see it, or know about it, so have some decorum.

12:34.940 --> 12:38.000
Your entire life shouldn't revolve around your sexual fetishes.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.600
But the push from the left doesn't seem to be about acceptance anymore.

12:41.600 --> 12:46.480
Though it uses some of the same language that gay activists of 20 years ago used, when talking

12:46.480 --> 12:49.520
about how they didn't actually want to turn other people gay, they just wanted to live

12:49.520 --> 12:54.060
quiet private lives and not be accosted for it, a completely reasonable demand.

12:54.060 --> 12:56.640
Now it's no longer about acceptance, but exclusion.

12:56.640 --> 13:00.900
To many trans activists, and to the detriment of normal trans people, not being interested

13:00.900 --> 13:05.500
in a trans woman because she has a dick is now transphobia, and any sort of mainstream

13:05.500 --> 13:09.660
backlash against that push, like for example the super straight meme, must be considered

13:09.660 --> 13:11.120
a hotbed of fascism.

13:11.120 --> 13:15.460
A normie who isn't interested in public kink is now a bigot for that preference, and

13:15.460 --> 13:19.400
he needs to be slandered with the label of incel because what an incel is, is no longer

13:19.400 --> 13:23.580
just an involuntary celibate person, but rather it's a reactionary movement that seeks to

13:23.580 --> 13:26.460
subjugate women and people of color because, well, why not.

13:26.460 --> 13:30.780
And those conservatives who decide to disengage from these new sexual values and return to

13:30.780 --> 13:35.440
their own romantic social structures are, yes you've heard it before, incels and bigots

13:35.440 --> 13:37.240
and fascists and all the rest of it.

13:37.240 --> 13:41.960
It's no longer about combating an intolerant right leaning society that has no place for

13:41.960 --> 13:43.480
leftist sexual morality.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.480
We did that.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.520
That fight is largely over.

13:45.520 --> 13:50.820
It's about making every possible place only a space for that leftist sexual morality,

13:50.820 --> 13:53.100
to the exclusion of everything else.

13:53.100 --> 13:57.860
Rightist sexual morality can't be allowed to coexist in their own spaces alongside leftist

13:57.860 --> 13:59.180
sexual morality.

13:59.180 --> 14:00.960
Everything needs to tilt towards them.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.480
I have no problem with Sam Brinton doing the professional level job he's qualified to

14:04.520 --> 14:06.800
I have no problem with his sexuality or gender identity.

14:06.800 --> 14:12.120
I have no problem with what kinks he engages in, behind closed doors or within sexual oriented

14:12.120 --> 14:13.120
environments.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.600
It's not about him at all.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.360
It's about the growing expectation that if you're not at least a little bit like him,

14:18.360 --> 14:21.080
you're part of a mechanism that represses people like him.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.080
I don't mean specifically.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.680
You don't have to have his exact kinks.

14:23.680 --> 14:27.240
But there's this growing idea within leftist spaces that if you're not completely open

14:27.240 --> 14:32.200
and public about all aspects of your sexuality, you're a sad, repressed, self-flagellating

14:32.200 --> 14:33.480
object of pity.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.480
I don't buy it.

14:34.480 --> 14:38.080
The much more likely result is that regardless of whether or not you have a sexual idiosyncrasy

14:38.080 --> 14:41.080
of your own, you've also just got a sense of good taste.
