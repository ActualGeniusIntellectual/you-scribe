1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
I have to warn you before we begin.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,800
The annoyance level of this video is high, even by my standards.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,960
Let me take you back about six months.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,120
The outcome of the 2020 election isn't known yet, but it seems like Trump might actually

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:24,000
win a second term, and the anti-liberty types, well, they're getting a bit unhinged about

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
it.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Remember this lady?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Here, just in case you don't.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll jog your memory.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,040
Listen, kiddo, I get it.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,840
I don't like the two-party system.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,120
I think our country's corrupt, and quite frankly, I don't want to vote for Biden.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,880
It feels like voting for a Republican, but I'm going to do it.

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,880
You want to know why?

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,880
Because the alternative is a fucking fascist.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,880
A fascist is a fascist.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,880
Maybe we can have the conversation about dismantling the two-party system when a fascist isn't

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
running.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,280
Maybe we can do that later, kiddo!

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
Champ!

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
Chief!

22
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,840
Maybe we can talk about it later!

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,240
You're welcome for that, by the way.

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,180
I still find it funny that leftists online call this woman a liberal.

25
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,560
I am in fact referring once again to that video that I made, where what leftists call

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,840
rad-libs are actually just part of the left they don't like.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,340
But listen to her rhetoric.

28
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,160
She doesn't want to vote for Biden because Biden seems like a Republican.

29
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,960
She wants somebody further left.

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,400
How is this a liberal?

31
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,960
And of course, people like this are now coming back and saying, oh, Biden's actually in power?

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,180
Well, the 2022 elections are just around the corner.

33
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,300
It's too early to talk about reforming the Democratic Party now.

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,100
It's too early to talk about the two-party system this time.

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,100
These people are living hypocrites.

36
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,100
That's not the topic of the video.

37
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,960
What I'm actually talking about here is why the hell do these people keep like raging

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,740
out in their cars?

39
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,740
You notice that, right?

40
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,260
You know there's a trend, right, of these people who, you know, they seem to be pretty

41
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,480
well-to-do.

42
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,540
They're sitting in their vehicles and they're just raging at their phones and then uploading

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,860
that rage as if it's somehow a normal thing to their TikTok accounts.

44
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,540
Around the same time when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, this woman put out a very similar video.

45
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,540
Holy ******* **** you guys!

46
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:13,540
I'm driving your car but I just got a notification that Ruth Bader Ginsburg died!

47
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,340
Holy ****!

48
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,200
Could this year get any ****ing worse?

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Ruth!

50
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,180
You just had to make it to 2021!

51
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,600
Holy ****, at least the first one, like, was not driving while recording the video.

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
Christ!

53
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,160
Get off the ******* road, lady.

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
You're gonna crash.

55
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,040
Oh wait, that's already been done.

56
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,680
Are you ready to keep going?

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,360
Or have you already clicked off the video?

58
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,060
I don't know. I'm gonna enjoy looking at the the analytics of this one to see like within the first minute. Everyone just stops watching

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:42,680
Imagine being such an actual snowflake

60
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,000
That simply seeing a pro-life sign as you drive by

61
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,040
Causes you to go into a breakdown like this. What kind of a mindset does this person have to have?

62
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,800
I mean, I'm not even pro-life. I'm definitely on the pro-choice side of that argument, but Christ

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,000
I've like I've walked by like like anti-abortion

64
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,800
Protests before I'm just like, oh, this is stupid and I keep going

65
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,200
I don't lose my shit while still driving the car and then post it online for everybody to see. Oh my god

66
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,000
There's another please stop, please. I'm just been yelling in my car for 30 minutes because

67
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Fucking parenting is hard

68
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,800
It's hard

69
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Because they're little mirrors

70
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:38,400
If if I want my son to be a better person or to grow up

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
I

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Have to be a good person

73
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
He mimics everything I do

74
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,440
He mirrors everything so if I have a fucking bad attitude, he's gonna have a god damn bad attitude

75
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,960
If I say fuck of course he's gonna say fuck

76
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
And

77
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,120
Your name your name's cat might be funny, I don't know I don't really find this funny, dude

78
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,280
I don't know what kind of a mindset you have to be in to be angry at the fact that you have to

79
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Be a good person

80
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,560
It's it almost sounds ridiculous to say it but like yes

81
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,880
You have to be a good person not just because you have a kid though

82
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,800
That definitely is a good reason but for yourself, too

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,440
it sounds like this this woman has never once ever taken responsibility for anything in her entire life and

84
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,240
Now has a child and now has to learn the skill of being a responsible human

85
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,720
From zero the whole point of waiting to have kids is that you can build up your ability to be responsible

86
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,360
To the point that being responsible for a child is not nearly as hard as this and it really does seem like this this

87
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,320
Extended adolescence that all of us find ourselves living through right now

88
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:11,920
It's not conducive to learning how to be a responsible human being this one just dropped and my pal Nikoko on Twitter

89
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,280
Posted it which is how I learned about it. Alright, let's see what you got

90
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:37,760
This fucking iron lung with me anywhere I goddamn go just in case if these don't work and you have the nerve to tell me

91
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,880
That I you have a doctor's note not to wear this

92
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,600
If any doctor gave you that it's because you're that fucking weak. You can't wear a piece of cloth

93
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:54,320
You're a fucking selfish bitch. And if your husband does that too in public, I hope you both catch COVID

94
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,320
I hope you both understand how serious this is

95
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,320
My 40 year old needs me

96
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,320
My disabled husband who broke his spine in 2016 fucking needs me

97
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,320
I'm the only one doing anything at my house because they need me

98
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,320
And your selfish trying to take me away from them

99
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
So

100
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,320
My girlfriend does in fact have a mask exemption because she faints while trying to wear one

101
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,320
So instead she wears a face shield and you know that that should be good enough for most people who aren't fucking insane

102
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,320
And I'm certainly not one of those anti-mask types if you want to wear a mask go ahead they they do work

103
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:36,320
But the whole COVID thing seems to have really hit a strange hysteria peak at this point

104
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,320
I think most people are fed up and done with following lockdown orders

105
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:48,320
And yet you have a separate group of people that are just screeching incoherently that you refuse to give up your freedom

106
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
And that is how I ultimately view it

107
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Not because I don't think COVID doesn't exist or masks don't work but it's simply that I won't let the state regulate what I do

108
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Especially when it comes to just normal behaviour

109
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,320
I know this one isn't in a car but it's in much the same vein

110
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Pre-pandemic nobody except the most insane would lose their shit at somebody else's regular everyday behaviour as they pass each other in the street or in an elevator or something

111
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,320
You are a delivery person incorrectly wearing the mask inside of a big building

112
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Is this incorrectly worn guys? Is this incorrectly worn?

113
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,320
It wasn't like that the whole fucking time

114
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:37,320
My god yeah I know you didn't see it because I cut it out in the editing but I actually watched that four times because I was stunned

115
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,320
I think it's highly irresponsible to work people up like this

116
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,320
COVID's bad don't get me wrong but it's not this bad alright?

117
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,320
This is not the post-apocalyptic zombie virus

118
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
We're gonna be fine

119
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Outdoors is a dangerous place that's just kinda how it is

120
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
And no amount of government management will ever change that fact

121
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,320
And all things considered, especially since we've already had it

122
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,320
I'd rather just go outside without a mask and take my chances you know? Breathe in the fresh air

123
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
This is another one that's not in a car

124
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,320
This one's from Charza Kitsune, a friend of mine

125
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,320
But still, it's the same kind of spirit you know?

126
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,320
I need to go out to where the lost people are, to where the people are

127
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Well people can hear my words, they can be convicted by the Holy Spirit

128
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,320
I didn't expect him to edit I thought this was gonna be the original clip

129
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Yes, she just screamed in the original, don't worry about it

130
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,320
And as soon as we actually exit the car, you'll notice that there are tons of videos

131
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Of left-leaning women who are just screaming their fucking heads off

132
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,320
And for what? I'm including this final one because I think this is a woman

133
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Is that semen?

134
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Get him out of fucking office!

135
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:18,320
I hate Trump! Just fucking vote for Biden, please!

136
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
What the fuck did I just watch dude?

137
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Up until now, this video has been about people who clearly have some kind of problem

138
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,320
And I don't mean the outward problem that they're yelling about

139
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,320
And how they choose to cope, which is by being somewhere

140
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Usually in the private place but not always

141
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,320
And just screaming about it

142
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,320
And I understand, you know, sometimes a situation is in fact so dire that you just have to yell

143
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,320
I get it

144
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,320
However, usually when that's authentic, you do it in private

145
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,320
Or you do it with your friends or your, you know, whatever, right?

146
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,320
It's during an argument maybe, like there's a bunch of different things it could be

147
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
But if there's one thing that makes me think that it's fake

148
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Or maybe not fake, maybe just staged I guess

149
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Is when they set it up and do it for a camera

150
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,320
And then take it and post it online

151
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Like okay, let's say something terrible has happened to you

152
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
And then you end up ranting for a couple minutes

153
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,320
And then afterwards you've vented and you kind of feel okay

154
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Alright, I understand

155
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,320
But if it really was some kind of emotional pressure release valve

156
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Why would you set up a camera?

157
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,320
And then afterwards, why would you take that video and then edit it

158
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Maybe you add text, maybe you add music

159
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
And then put it online

160
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,320
An emotional outburst that happens in that very second I completely understand

161
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,320
But there are multiple instances in the timeline here

162
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Where if it were truly just an outburst

163
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Rational thought should have taken hold

164
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
And here's why I'm saying this

165
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,320
This video went viral yesterday

166
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:15,320
I am not saying this to be heartless

167
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Losing a pet is definitely like losing a member of your family

168
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
But notice what we're looking at, okay?

169
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,320
The snake is not in its container

170
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,320
You can see the door to the container with the key still off to the side by her head

171
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
The snake is instead on the floor

172
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,320
She has set the camera up so that you can very clearly see the snake and her holding it

173
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
She set it to record

174
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
She gets herself into frame

175
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,320
She cradles the body of her beloved pet while crying

176
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
And then adds text and music to it

177
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
And then uploads it

178
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,320
What kind of person films themselves holding their dead pet

179
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
And then puts it online for clout

180
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,320
I've known people who have lost pets

181
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,320
In fact somebody I know just lost a cat

182
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,320
And they don't post videos and pictures of the fucking corpse

183
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
They'll post pictures of them when they were alive

184
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,320
Are we gonna be seeing shit like this with grandmas on TikTok soon?

185
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
With some 12 year old trying desperately to go viral

186
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Cradles the body of their dead grandma while like angling the selfie

187
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Oh wait

188
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Yeah

189
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
We've um

190
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
We've already seen that haven't we

191
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
It was a big deal

192
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
When

193
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Was it Jake Paul or Logan Paul?

194
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
I can't even remember

195
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
They're both fucking terrible people

196
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,320
But when one of them found the hanging body in the suicide forest in Japan

197
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
And made a video about it

198
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
And it's like

199
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Oh my god guys

200
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
We found a body

201
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Isn't this crazy

202
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Clickbait thumbnails

203
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Ad revenue

204
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
And it's just like

205
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
Fuck off dude

206
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Is there even a scrap of humanity left in you

207
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,320
That is what a lot of this feels like you know

208
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Now I get it

209
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
Like it can be funny okay

210
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
I understand that at some point there's dark humor

211
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Like the uh

212
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,320
The guy who uses those face swap filters

213
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,320
To swap faces with a dead body at a wake

214
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Okay

215
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
On some level you just

216
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Must laugh at the absurd

217
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
But that's for people uninvolved to laugh at right

218
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Like we can look at this

219
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
At this photo

220
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,320
And think it's darkly hilarious

221
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,320
But what kind of person do you have to be to actually snap this photo

222
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
In fact maybe that's part of the humor

223
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,320
It feels kind of like social media is turning people into sociopaths

224
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
If that makes sense

225
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
That's a phrase I used in a previous video

226
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
I can't really remember which one it is

227
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
So I guess I can't link to it in a YouTube card

228
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Oops

229
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
But yeah

230
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Social media is turning people into sociopaths

231
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
And I definitely think a symptom of it

232
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Is that people massively overshare

233
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
On what ultimately is

234
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Public social media

235
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
I know it's like privately owned

236
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
But by public I mean like

237
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
You can access it right

238
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
YouTube is a privately owned company

239
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
But anyone can find your YouTube videos

240
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
So it is public on that level

241
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
And when someone has some private

242
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Intimate

243
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Emotional freak out

244
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
And then posts it online

245
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
There's um

246
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
There's a shallowness to it

247
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
There's a fakeness to it

248
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
A manufacturedness to it

249
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
It seems like these people are

250
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Ridiculously self absorbed

251
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
To the point that

252
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
One they cannot conceive of anybody

253
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Ever disagreeing with them on anything

254
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
So when it happens they freak out

255
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
And two they're ultimately posting it

256
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,320
For validation of their ridiculous state

257
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Knowing that most people in their real life

258
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Probably wouldn't validate them

259
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
In the pre-internet days

260
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
If you were somebody who was a bit out to lunch

261
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
At the very least the people around you

262
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Would tell you that you were out to lunch

263
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
But now

264
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Now you can retreat into an echo chamber

265
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
You can find like minded people

266
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Who will tell you that it's okay

267
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
And that happens with politics yeah

268
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
And it happens with fetishes of course

269
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
But it also happens with strange things like

270
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
The pro-anorexia community

271
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Where they talk about how being anorexic

272
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
Is good actually

273
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
And how they encourage each other

274
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
To be anorexic

275
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
Because it's something that non-anorexic people

276
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
Can never understand

277
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
It's like I said in my

278
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Consumption is identity video

279
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
If you take a quality of yourself

280
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Into yourself

281
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
To such an extent that you identify as it

282
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,320
If it turns out that quality is toxic

283
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
It's going to be significantly harder

284
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
For you to get rid of it

285
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
I think these people do have the emotions

286
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
That they're portraying in these videos

287
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,320
But one the emotions are absolutely being riled up

288
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
On largely false pretenses

289
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,320
And two they are completely incentivized

290
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
To portray them in this way

291
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
To indulge in the loss of self-control

292
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
And you know I get it

293
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
It's hard to stay grounded

294
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Like I've gained 3,000 subs in the past month

295
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,320
And I'm really appreciative of all you guys

296
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,320
Who are subbing and watching the videos and everything

297
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
Like numbers for me are way up right now

298
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
And it's great

299
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,320
But I feel it in the back of my head

300
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
That whisper that popularity means

301
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
That you are greater than what you actually are

302
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
And it's not true

303
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
But that is what social media does to people

304
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
I don't think that we're like

305
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Evolutionarily equipped

306
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,320
To deal with seeing 100,000 likes

307
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,320
Come in on something from 100,000 people

308
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Or alternatively

309
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
To be canceled by 100,000 people

310
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
For something relatively innocuous

311
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Even if it's bad

312
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
But it's not like that bad

313
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Social media has ramped that shit up to the extreme

314
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
And I'm not surprised

315
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,320
People are just like collapsing

316
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Because of it

317
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Either they're collapsing from being canceled

318
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
And spiraling into a depression

319
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Or alternatively

320
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
They start getting way too high off their own farts

321
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
Because so many people like them

322
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
We live in an era where keeping yourself grounded

323
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Having some self control

324
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Stuff like truthfulness

325
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
And modesty

326
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
And humility

327
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
These are all virtues that are needed

328
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
More than ever right now

329
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,320
And yet they are absolutely the last virtues

330
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
Being cultivated by people who are

331
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
Going through I guess this is

332
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,320
The millennials version of the midlife crisis

333
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
Is the social media crisis

334
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
I don't think this is just an old man yells at cloud thing

335
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
Though it definitely could be

336
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
That's a running theme in my channel recently

337
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
Is that I'm an old man

338
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
But I think there's actually a problem here

339
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
I think social media is creating

340
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,320
A group of, not a generation, but a group of people

341
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
That are just straight up sociopaths

342
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Triggered by the extreme ups and downs

343
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,320
That you get from excessive social media use

344
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
And while it sucks

345
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
And I recommend to everyone

346
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
Spend some time outside

347
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Don't stay on social media that much

348
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Still it's uh

349
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
It's still a lot of fun for us

Absolutely froth at the mouth

353
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
Over literally nothing
