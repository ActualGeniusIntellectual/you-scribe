0	7840	I have to warn you before we begin.
7840	11800	The annoyance level of this video is high, even by my standards.
11800	13960	Let me take you back about six months.
13960	18120	The outcome of the 2020 election isn't known yet, but it seems like Trump might actually
18120	24000	win a second term, and the anti-liberty types, well, they're getting a bit unhinged about
24000	25000	it.
25000	26000	Remember this lady?
26000	27000	Here, just in case you don't.
27000	28000	I'll jog your memory.
28000	30040	Listen, kiddo, I get it.
30040	31840	I don't like the two-party system.
31840	36120	I think our country's corrupt, and quite frankly, I don't want to vote for Biden.
36120	39880	It feels like voting for a Republican, but I'm going to do it.
39880	40880	You want to know why?
40880	43880	Because the alternative is a fucking fascist.
43880	45880	A fascist is a fascist.
45880	51880	Maybe we can have the conversation about dismantling the two-party system when a fascist isn't
51880	52880	running.
53280	56280	Maybe we can do that later, kiddo!
56280	57280	Champ!
57280	58280	Chief!
58280	61840	Maybe we can talk about it later!
61840	63240	You're welcome for that, by the way.
63240	67180	I still find it funny that leftists online call this woman a liberal.
67180	71560	I am in fact referring once again to that video that I made, where what leftists call
71560	74840	rad-libs are actually just part of the left they don't like.
74840	76340	But listen to her rhetoric.
76340	79160	She doesn't want to vote for Biden because Biden seems like a Republican.
79160	80960	She wants somebody further left.
80960	82400	How is this a liberal?
82400	87960	And of course, people like this are now coming back and saying, oh, Biden's actually in power?
87960	90180	Well, the 2022 elections are just around the corner.
90180	93300	It's too early to talk about reforming the Democratic Party now.
93300	96100	It's too early to talk about the two-party system this time.
96100	97100	These people are living hypocrites.
97100	98100	That's not the topic of the video.
98100	102960	What I'm actually talking about here is why the hell do these people keep like raging
102960	104740	out in their cars?
104740	105740	You notice that, right?
105740	109260	You know there's a trend, right, of these people who, you know, they seem to be pretty
109260	110480	well-to-do.
110480	114540	They're sitting in their vehicles and they're just raging at their phones and then uploading
114540	118860	that rage as if it's somehow a normal thing to their TikTok accounts.
118860	123540	Around the same time when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, this woman put out a very similar video.
123540	124540	Holy ******* **** you guys!
124540	133540	I'm driving your car but I just got a notification that Ruth Bader Ginsburg died!
133540	137340	Holy ****!
137340	143200	Could this year get any ****ing worse?
143200	144200	Ruth!
144200	148180	You just had to make it to 2021!
148180	153600	Holy ****, at least the first one, like, was not driving while recording the video.
153600	154600	Christ!
154600	156160	Get off the ******* road, lady.
156160	157160	You're gonna crash.
157160	160040	Oh wait, that's already been done.
160040	161680	Are you ready to keep going?
161680	163360	Or have you already clicked off the video?
163360	170060	I don't know. I'm gonna enjoy looking at the the analytics of this one to see like within the first minute. Everyone just stops watching
193360	222680	Imagine being such an actual snowflake
222960	228000	That simply seeing a pro-life sign as you drive by
228480	234040	Causes you to go into a breakdown like this. What kind of a mindset does this person have to have?
234040	239800	I mean, I'm not even pro-life. I'm definitely on the pro-choice side of that argument, but Christ
239800	243000	I've like I've walked by like like anti-abortion
243640	246800	Protests before I'm just like, oh, this is stupid and I keep going
246800	252200	I don't lose my shit while still driving the car and then post it online for everybody to see. Oh my god
252200	258000	There's another please stop, please. I'm just been yelling in my car for 30 minutes because
259880	261880	Fucking parenting is hard
263800	265800	It's hard
267400	269400	Because they're little mirrors
271040	278400	If if I want my son to be a better person or to grow up
282200	284200	I
284200	286200	Have to be a good person
289200	291200	He mimics everything I do
292080	298440	He mirrors everything so if I have a fucking bad attitude, he's gonna have a god damn bad attitude
301400	304960	If I say fuck of course he's gonna say fuck
304960	306960	And
312800	317120	Your name your name's cat might be funny, I don't know I don't really find this funny, dude
317120	322280	I don't know what kind of a mindset you have to be in to be angry at the fact that you have to
322640	324640	Be a good person
324840	328560	It's it almost sounds ridiculous to say it but like yes
328560	331880	You have to be a good person not just because you have a kid though
331880	334800	That definitely is a good reason but for yourself, too
335000	341440	it sounds like this this woman has never once ever taken responsibility for anything in her entire life and
341640	346240	Now has a child and now has to learn the skill of being a responsible human
346760	352720	From zero the whole point of waiting to have kids is that you can build up your ability to be responsible
353280	360360	To the point that being responsible for a child is not nearly as hard as this and it really does seem like this this
360520	364320	Extended adolescence that all of us find ourselves living through right now
364320	371920	It's not conducive to learning how to be a responsible human being this one just dropped and my pal Nikoko on Twitter
372320	375280	Posted it which is how I learned about it. Alright, let's see what you got
390360	397760	This fucking iron lung with me anywhere I goddamn go just in case if these don't work and you have the nerve to tell me
397920	400880	That I you have a doctor's note not to wear this
401440	406600	If any doctor gave you that it's because you're that fucking weak. You can't wear a piece of cloth
407320	414320	You're a fucking selfish bitch. And if your husband does that too in public, I hope you both catch COVID
414320	417320	I hope you both understand how serious this is
417320	419320	My 40 year old needs me
419320	424320	My disabled husband who broke his spine in 2016 fucking needs me
424320	428320	I'm the only one doing anything at my house because they need me
428320	432320	And your selfish trying to take me away from them
432320	433320	So
433320	439320	My girlfriend does in fact have a mask exemption because she faints while trying to wear one
439320	444320	So instead she wears a face shield and you know that that should be good enough for most people who aren't fucking insane
444320	449320	And I'm certainly not one of those anti-mask types if you want to wear a mask go ahead they they do work
449320	456320	But the whole COVID thing seems to have really hit a strange hysteria peak at this point
456320	461320	I think most people are fed up and done with following lockdown orders
461320	468320	And yet you have a separate group of people that are just screeching incoherently that you refuse to give up your freedom
468320	470320	And that is how I ultimately view it
470320	476320	Not because I don't think COVID doesn't exist or masks don't work but it's simply that I won't let the state regulate what I do
476320	479320	Especially when it comes to just normal behaviour
479320	483320	I know this one isn't in a car but it's in much the same vein
483320	495320	Pre-pandemic nobody except the most insane would lose their shit at somebody else's regular everyday behaviour as they pass each other in the street or in an elevator or something
496320	500320	You are a delivery person incorrectly wearing the mask inside of a big building
500320	504320	Is this incorrectly worn guys? Is this incorrectly worn?
504320	509320	It wasn't like that the whole fucking time
509320	517320	My god yeah I know you didn't see it because I cut it out in the editing but I actually watched that four times because I was stunned
517320	522320	I think it's highly irresponsible to work people up like this
522320	526320	COVID's bad don't get me wrong but it's not this bad alright?
526320	529320	This is not the post-apocalyptic zombie virus
529320	530320	We're gonna be fine
530320	534320	Outdoors is a dangerous place that's just kinda how it is
534320	538320	And no amount of government management will ever change that fact
538320	542320	And all things considered, especially since we've already had it
542320	547320	I'd rather just go outside without a mask and take my chances you know? Breathe in the fresh air
547320	549320	This is another one that's not in a car
549320	552320	This one's from Charza Kitsune, a friend of mine
552320	555320	But still, it's the same kind of spirit you know?
555320	558320	I need to go out to where the lost people are, to where the people are
558320	563320	Well people can hear my words, they can be convicted by the Holy Spirit
571320	576320	I didn't expect him to edit I thought this was gonna be the original clip
576320	579320	Yes, she just screamed in the original, don't worry about it
579320	584320	And as soon as we actually exit the car, you'll notice that there are tons of videos
584320	589320	Of left-leaning women who are just screaming their fucking heads off
589320	594320	And for what? I'm including this final one because I think this is a woman
602320	603320	Is that semen?
606320	608320	Get him out of fucking office!
611320	618320	I hate Trump! Just fucking vote for Biden, please!
621320	623320	What the fuck did I just watch dude?
623320	630320	Up until now, this video has been about people who clearly have some kind of problem
630320	633320	And I don't mean the outward problem that they're yelling about
633320	637320	And how they choose to cope, which is by being somewhere
637320	639320	Usually in the private place but not always
639320	642320	And just screaming about it
642320	648320	And I understand, you know, sometimes a situation is in fact so dire that you just have to yell
648320	649320	I get it
649320	654320	However, usually when that's authentic, you do it in private
654320	657320	Or you do it with your friends or your, you know, whatever, right?
657320	660320	It's during an argument maybe, like there's a bunch of different things it could be
660320	662320	But if there's one thing that makes me think that it's fake
662320	666320	Or maybe not fake, maybe just staged I guess
666320	670320	Is when they set it up and do it for a camera
670320	673320	And then take it and post it online
673320	675320	Like okay, let's say something terrible has happened to you
675320	677320	And then you end up ranting for a couple minutes
677320	680320	And then afterwards you've vented and you kind of feel okay
680320	681320	Alright, I understand
681320	685320	But if it really was some kind of emotional pressure release valve
685320	687320	Why would you set up a camera?
687320	690320	And then afterwards, why would you take that video and then edit it
690320	693320	Maybe you add text, maybe you add music
693320	694320	And then put it online
694320	699320	An emotional outburst that happens in that very second I completely understand
699320	703320	But there are multiple instances in the timeline here
703320	706320	Where if it were truly just an outburst
706320	708320	Rational thought should have taken hold
708320	710320	And here's why I'm saying this
710320	713320	This video went viral yesterday
717320	735320	I am not saying this to be heartless
735320	739320	Losing a pet is definitely like losing a member of your family
739320	741320	But notice what we're looking at, okay?
741320	744320	The snake is not in its container
744320	748320	You can see the door to the container with the key still off to the side by her head
748320	750320	The snake is instead on the floor
750320	755320	She has set the camera up so that you can very clearly see the snake and her holding it
755320	756320	She set it to record
756320	758320	She gets herself into frame
758320	762320	She cradles the body of her beloved pet while crying
762320	764320	And then adds text and music to it
764320	765320	And then uploads it
765320	768320	What kind of person films themselves holding their dead pet
768320	770320	And then puts it online for clout
770320	773320	I've known people who have lost pets
773320	775320	In fact somebody I know just lost a cat
775320	780320	And they don't post videos and pictures of the fucking corpse
780320	782320	They'll post pictures of them when they were alive
782320	785320	Are we gonna be seeing shit like this with grandmas on TikTok soon?
785320	787320	With some 12 year old trying desperately to go viral
787320	791320	Cradles the body of their dead grandma while like angling the selfie
791320	792320	Oh wait
792320	794320	Yeah
794320	795320	We've um
795320	797320	We've already seen that haven't we
797320	798320	It was a big deal
798320	799320	When
799320	801320	Was it Jake Paul or Logan Paul?
801320	802320	I can't even remember
802320	804320	They're both fucking terrible people
804320	810320	But when one of them found the hanging body in the suicide forest in Japan
810320	812320	And made a video about it
812320	813320	And it's like
813320	814320	Oh my god guys
814320	815320	We found a body
815320	816320	Isn't this crazy
816320	817320	Clickbait thumbnails
817320	818320	Ad revenue
818320	819320	And it's just like
819320	820320	Fuck off dude
820320	823320	Is there even a scrap of humanity left in you
823320	826320	That is what a lot of this feels like you know
826320	827320	Now I get it
827320	828320	Like it can be funny okay
828320	830320	I understand that at some point there's dark humor
830320	831320	Like the uh
831320	835320	The guy who uses those face swap filters
835320	838320	To swap faces with a dead body at a wake
838320	839320	Okay
839320	840320	On some level you just
840320	842320	Must laugh at the absurd
842320	844320	But that's for people uninvolved to laugh at right
844320	845320	Like we can look at this
845320	846320	At this photo
846320	849320	And think it's darkly hilarious
849320	852320	But what kind of person do you have to be to actually snap this photo
852320	854320	In fact maybe that's part of the humor
854320	858320	It feels kind of like social media is turning people into sociopaths
858320	859320	If that makes sense
859320	861320	That's a phrase I used in a previous video
861320	862320	I can't really remember which one it is
862320	864320	So I guess I can't link to it in a YouTube card
864320	865320	Oops
865320	866320	But yeah
866320	867320	Social media is turning people into sociopaths
867320	868320	And I definitely think a symptom of it
868320	870320	Is that people massively overshare
870320	871320	On what ultimately is
871320	873320	Public social media
873320	874320	I know it's like privately owned
874320	875320	But by public I mean like
875320	876320	You can access it right
876320	878320	YouTube is a privately owned company
878320	879320	But anyone can find your YouTube videos
879320	881320	So it is public on that level
881320	883320	And when someone has some private
883320	884320	Intimate
884320	885320	Emotional freak out
885320	887320	And then posts it online
887320	888320	There's um
888320	890320	There's a shallowness to it
890320	891320	There's a fakeness to it
891320	893320	A manufacturedness to it
893320	895320	It seems like these people are
895320	897320	Ridiculously self absorbed
897320	898320	To the point that
898320	900320	One they cannot conceive of anybody
900320	902320	Ever disagreeing with them on anything
902320	903320	So when it happens they freak out
903320	905320	And two they're ultimately posting it
905320	908320	For validation of their ridiculous state
908320	910320	Knowing that most people in their real life
910320	912320	Probably wouldn't validate them
912320	913320	In the pre-internet days
913320	915320	If you were somebody who was a bit out to lunch
915320	916320	At the very least the people around you
916320	918320	Would tell you that you were out to lunch
918320	919320	But now
919320	921320	Now you can retreat into an echo chamber
921320	922320	You can find like minded people
922320	923320	Who will tell you that it's okay
923320	925320	And that happens with politics yeah
925320	927320	And it happens with fetishes of course
927320	929320	But it also happens with strange things like
929320	931320	The pro-anorexia community
931320	933320	Where they talk about how being anorexic
933320	934320	Is good actually
934320	935320	And how they encourage each other
935320	937320	To be anorexic
937320	939320	Because it's something that non-anorexic people
939320	940320	Can never understand
940320	941320	It's like I said in my
941320	943320	Consumption is identity video
944320	946320	If you take a quality of yourself
946320	947320	Into yourself
947320	949320	To such an extent that you identify as it
949320	952320	If it turns out that quality is toxic
952320	954320	It's going to be significantly harder
954320	955320	For you to get rid of it
955320	957320	I think these people do have the emotions
957320	959320	That they're portraying in these videos
959320	962320	But one the emotions are absolutely being riled up
962320	964320	On largely false pretenses
964320	967320	And two they are completely incentivized
967320	969320	To portray them in this way
969320	971320	To indulge in the loss of self-control
972320	973320	And you know I get it
973320	974320	It's hard to stay grounded
974320	977320	Like I've gained 3,000 subs in the past month
977320	979320	And I'm really appreciative of all you guys
979320	982320	Who are subbing and watching the videos and everything
982320	983320	Like numbers for me are way up right now
983320	984320	And it's great
984320	987320	But I feel it in the back of my head
987320	989320	That whisper that popularity means
989320	991320	That you are greater than what you actually are
991320	992320	And it's not true
992320	994320	But that is what social media does to people
994320	996320	I don't think that we're like
996320	998320	Evolutionarily equipped
998320	1001320	To deal with seeing 100,000 likes
1001320	1004320	Come in on something from 100,000 people
1004320	1005320	Or alternatively
1005320	1007320	To be canceled by 100,000 people
1007320	1009320	For something relatively innocuous
1009320	1010320	Even if it's bad
1010320	1011320	But it's not like that bad
1011320	1014320	Social media has ramped that shit up to the extreme
1014320	1015320	And I'm not surprised
1015320	1018320	People are just like collapsing
1018320	1019320	Because of it
1019320	1021320	Either they're collapsing from being canceled
1021320	1022320	And spiraling into a depression
1022320	1023320	Or alternatively
1023320	1025320	They start getting way too high off their own farts
1025320	1027320	Because so many people like them
1027320	1029320	We live in an era where keeping yourself grounded
1029320	1031320	Having some self control
1031320	1032320	Stuff like truthfulness
1032320	1033320	And modesty
1033320	1034320	And humility
1034320	1036320	These are all virtues that are needed
1036320	1038320	More than ever right now
1038320	1041320	And yet they are absolutely the last virtues
1041320	1043320	Being cultivated by people who are
1043320	1045320	Going through I guess this is
1045320	1047320	The millennials version of the midlife crisis
1047320	1049320	Is the social media crisis
1049320	1051320	I don't think this is just an old man yells at cloud thing
1051320	1053320	Though it definitely could be
1053320	1055320	That's a running theme in my channel recently
1055320	1056320	Is that I'm an old man
1056320	1058320	But I think there's actually a problem here
1058320	1060320	I think social media is creating
1060320	1063320	A group of, not a generation, but a group of people
1063320	1065320	That are just straight up sociopaths
1065320	1067320	Triggered by the extreme ups and downs
1067320	1070320	That you get from excessive social media use
1070320	1071320	And while it sucks
1071320	1073320	And I recommend to everyone
1073320	1074320	Spend some time outside
1074320	1076320	Don't stay on social media that much
1076320	1077320	Still it's uh
1077320	1079320	It's still a lot of fun for us
1079320	1081320	You know regular people who still have their heads screwed on straight
1081320	1083320	Watching these nut cases
1083320	1085320	Absolutely froth at the mouth
1085320	1087320	Over literally nothing
