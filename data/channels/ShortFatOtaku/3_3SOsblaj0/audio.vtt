WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.840
I have to warn you before we begin.

00:07.840 --> 00:11.800
The annoyance level of this video is high, even by my standards.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.960
Let me take you back about six months.

00:13.960 --> 00:18.120
The outcome of the 2020 election isn't known yet, but it seems like Trump might actually

00:18.120 --> 00:24.000
win a second term, and the anti-liberty types, well, they're getting a bit unhinged about

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
it.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
Remember this lady?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
Here, just in case you don't.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
I'll jog your memory.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.040
Listen, kiddo, I get it.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.840
I don't like the two-party system.

00:31.840 --> 00:36.120
I think our country's corrupt, and quite frankly, I don't want to vote for Biden.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.880
It feels like voting for a Republican, but I'm going to do it.

00:39.880 --> 00:40.880
You want to know why?

00:40.880 --> 00:43.880
Because the alternative is a fucking fascist.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.880
A fascist is a fascist.

00:45.880 --> 00:51.880
Maybe we can have the conversation about dismantling the two-party system when a fascist isn't

00:51.880 --> 00:52.880
running.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.280
Maybe we can do that later, kiddo!

00:56.280 --> 00:57.280
Champ!

00:57.280 --> 00:58.280
Chief!

00:58.280 --> 01:01.840
Maybe we can talk about it later!

01:01.840 --> 01:03.240
You're welcome for that, by the way.

01:03.240 --> 01:07.180
I still find it funny that leftists online call this woman a liberal.

01:07.180 --> 01:11.560
I am in fact referring once again to that video that I made, where what leftists call

01:11.560 --> 01:14.840
rad-libs are actually just part of the left they don't like.

01:14.840 --> 01:16.340
But listen to her rhetoric.

01:16.340 --> 01:19.160
She doesn't want to vote for Biden because Biden seems like a Republican.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.960
She wants somebody further left.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.400
How is this a liberal?

01:22.400 --> 01:27.960
And of course, people like this are now coming back and saying, oh, Biden's actually in power?

01:27.960 --> 01:30.180
Well, the 2022 elections are just around the corner.

01:30.180 --> 01:33.300
It's too early to talk about reforming the Democratic Party now.

01:33.300 --> 01:36.100
It's too early to talk about the two-party system this time.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.100
These people are living hypocrites.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.100
That's not the topic of the video.

01:38.100 --> 01:42.960
What I'm actually talking about here is why the hell do these people keep like raging

01:42.960 --> 01:44.740
out in their cars?

01:44.740 --> 01:45.740
You notice that, right?

01:45.740 --> 01:49.260
You know there's a trend, right, of these people who, you know, they seem to be pretty

01:49.260 --> 01:50.480
well-to-do.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.540
They're sitting in their vehicles and they're just raging at their phones and then uploading

01:54.540 --> 01:58.860
that rage as if it's somehow a normal thing to their TikTok accounts.

01:58.860 --> 02:03.540
Around the same time when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, this woman put out a very similar video.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.540
Holy ******* **** you guys!

02:04.540 --> 02:13.540
I'm driving your car but I just got a notification that Ruth Bader Ginsburg died!

02:13.540 --> 02:17.340
Holy ****!

02:17.340 --> 02:23.200
Could this year get any ****ing worse?

02:23.200 --> 02:24.200
Ruth!

02:24.200 --> 02:28.180
You just had to make it to 2021!

02:28.180 --> 02:33.600
Holy ****, at least the first one, like, was not driving while recording the video.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.600
Christ!

02:34.600 --> 02:36.160
Get off the ******* road, lady.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.160
You're gonna crash.

02:37.160 --> 02:40.040
Oh wait, that's already been done.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.680
Are you ready to keep going?

02:41.680 --> 02:43.360
Or have you already clicked off the video?

02:43.360 --> 02:50.060
I don't know. I'm gonna enjoy looking at the the analytics of this one to see like within the first minute. Everyone just stops watching

03:13.360 --> 03:42.680
Imagine being such an actual snowflake

03:42.960 --> 03:48.000
That simply seeing a pro-life sign as you drive by

03:48.480 --> 03:54.040
Causes you to go into a breakdown like this. What kind of a mindset does this person have to have?

03:54.040 --> 03:59.800
I mean, I'm not even pro-life. I'm definitely on the pro-choice side of that argument, but Christ

03:59.800 --> 04:03.000
I've like I've walked by like like anti-abortion

04:03.640 --> 04:06.800
Protests before I'm just like, oh, this is stupid and I keep going

04:06.800 --> 04:12.200
I don't lose my shit while still driving the car and then post it online for everybody to see. Oh my god

04:12.200 --> 04:18.000
There's another please stop, please. I'm just been yelling in my car for 30 minutes because

04:19.880 --> 04:21.880
Fucking parenting is hard

04:23.800 --> 04:25.800
It's hard

04:27.400 --> 04:29.400
Because they're little mirrors

04:31.040 --> 04:38.400
If if I want my son to be a better person or to grow up

04:42.200 --> 04:44.200
I

04:44.200 --> 04:46.200
Have to be a good person

04:49.200 --> 04:51.200
He mimics everything I do

04:52.080 --> 04:58.440
He mirrors everything so if I have a fucking bad attitude, he's gonna have a god damn bad attitude

05:01.400 --> 05:04.960
If I say fuck of course he's gonna say fuck

05:04.960 --> 05:06.960
And

05:12.800 --> 05:17.120
Your name your name's cat might be funny, I don't know I don't really find this funny, dude

05:17.120 --> 05:22.280
I don't know what kind of a mindset you have to be in to be angry at the fact that you have to

05:22.640 --> 05:24.640
Be a good person

05:24.840 --> 05:28.560
It's it almost sounds ridiculous to say it but like yes

05:28.560 --> 05:31.880
You have to be a good person not just because you have a kid though

05:31.880 --> 05:34.800
That definitely is a good reason but for yourself, too

05:35.000 --> 05:41.440
it sounds like this this woman has never once ever taken responsibility for anything in her entire life and

05:41.640 --> 05:46.240
Now has a child and now has to learn the skill of being a responsible human

05:46.760 --> 05:52.720
From zero the whole point of waiting to have kids is that you can build up your ability to be responsible

05:53.280 --> 06:00.360
To the point that being responsible for a child is not nearly as hard as this and it really does seem like this this

06:00.520 --> 06:04.320
Extended adolescence that all of us find ourselves living through right now

06:04.320 --> 06:11.920
It's not conducive to learning how to be a responsible human being this one just dropped and my pal Nikoko on Twitter

06:12.320 --> 06:15.280
Posted it which is how I learned about it. Alright, let's see what you got

06:30.360 --> 06:37.760
This fucking iron lung with me anywhere I goddamn go just in case if these don't work and you have the nerve to tell me

06:37.920 --> 06:40.880
That I you have a doctor's note not to wear this

06:41.440 --> 06:46.600
If any doctor gave you that it's because you're that fucking weak. You can't wear a piece of cloth

06:47.320 --> 06:54.320
You're a fucking selfish bitch. And if your husband does that too in public, I hope you both catch COVID

06:54.320 --> 06:57.320
I hope you both understand how serious this is

06:57.320 --> 06:59.320
My 40 year old needs me

06:59.320 --> 07:04.320
My disabled husband who broke his spine in 2016 fucking needs me

07:04.320 --> 07:08.320
I'm the only one doing anything at my house because they need me

07:08.320 --> 07:12.320
And your selfish trying to take me away from them

07:12.320 --> 07:13.320
So

07:13.320 --> 07:19.320
My girlfriend does in fact have a mask exemption because she faints while trying to wear one

07:19.320 --> 07:24.320
So instead she wears a face shield and you know that that should be good enough for most people who aren't fucking insane

07:24.320 --> 07:29.320
And I'm certainly not one of those anti-mask types if you want to wear a mask go ahead they they do work

07:29.320 --> 07:36.320
But the whole COVID thing seems to have really hit a strange hysteria peak at this point

07:36.320 --> 07:41.320
I think most people are fed up and done with following lockdown orders

07:41.320 --> 07:48.320
And yet you have a separate group of people that are just screeching incoherently that you refuse to give up your freedom

07:48.320 --> 07:50.320
And that is how I ultimately view it

07:50.320 --> 07:56.320
Not because I don't think COVID doesn't exist or masks don't work but it's simply that I won't let the state regulate what I do

07:56.320 --> 07:59.320
Especially when it comes to just normal behaviour

07:59.320 --> 08:03.320
I know this one isn't in a car but it's in much the same vein

08:03.320 --> 08:15.320
Pre-pandemic nobody except the most insane would lose their shit at somebody else's regular everyday behaviour as they pass each other in the street or in an elevator or something

08:16.320 --> 08:20.320
You are a delivery person incorrectly wearing the mask inside of a big building

08:20.320 --> 08:24.320
Is this incorrectly worn guys? Is this incorrectly worn?

08:24.320 --> 08:29.320
It wasn't like that the whole fucking time

08:29.320 --> 08:37.320
My god yeah I know you didn't see it because I cut it out in the editing but I actually watched that four times because I was stunned

08:37.320 --> 08:42.320
I think it's highly irresponsible to work people up like this

08:42.320 --> 08:46.320
COVID's bad don't get me wrong but it's not this bad alright?

08:46.320 --> 08:49.320
This is not the post-apocalyptic zombie virus

08:49.320 --> 08:50.320
We're gonna be fine

08:50.320 --> 08:54.320
Outdoors is a dangerous place that's just kinda how it is

08:54.320 --> 08:58.320
And no amount of government management will ever change that fact

08:58.320 --> 09:02.320
And all things considered, especially since we've already had it

09:02.320 --> 09:07.320
I'd rather just go outside without a mask and take my chances you know? Breathe in the fresh air

09:07.320 --> 09:09.320
This is another one that's not in a car

09:09.320 --> 09:12.320
This one's from Charza Kitsune, a friend of mine

09:12.320 --> 09:15.320
But still, it's the same kind of spirit you know?

09:15.320 --> 09:18.320
I need to go out to where the lost people are, to where the people are

09:18.320 --> 09:23.320
Well people can hear my words, they can be convicted by the Holy Spirit

09:31.320 --> 09:36.320
I didn't expect him to edit I thought this was gonna be the original clip

09:36.320 --> 09:39.320
Yes, she just screamed in the original, don't worry about it

09:39.320 --> 09:44.320
And as soon as we actually exit the car, you'll notice that there are tons of videos

09:44.320 --> 09:49.320
Of left-leaning women who are just screaming their fucking heads off

09:49.320 --> 09:54.320
And for what? I'm including this final one because I think this is a woman

10:02.320 --> 10:03.320
Is that semen?

10:06.320 --> 10:08.320
Get him out of fucking office!

10:11.320 --> 10:18.320
I hate Trump! Just fucking vote for Biden, please!

10:21.320 --> 10:23.320
What the fuck did I just watch dude?

10:23.320 --> 10:30.320
Up until now, this video has been about people who clearly have some kind of problem

10:30.320 --> 10:33.320
And I don't mean the outward problem that they're yelling about

10:33.320 --> 10:37.320
And how they choose to cope, which is by being somewhere

10:37.320 --> 10:39.320
Usually in the private place but not always

10:39.320 --> 10:42.320
And just screaming about it

10:42.320 --> 10:48.320
And I understand, you know, sometimes a situation is in fact so dire that you just have to yell

10:48.320 --> 10:49.320
I get it

10:49.320 --> 10:54.320
However, usually when that's authentic, you do it in private

10:54.320 --> 10:57.320
Or you do it with your friends or your, you know, whatever, right?

10:57.320 --> 11:00.320
It's during an argument maybe, like there's a bunch of different things it could be

11:00.320 --> 11:02.320
But if there's one thing that makes me think that it's fake

11:02.320 --> 11:06.320
Or maybe not fake, maybe just staged I guess

11:06.320 --> 11:10.320
Is when they set it up and do it for a camera

11:10.320 --> 11:13.320
And then take it and post it online

11:13.320 --> 11:15.320
Like okay, let's say something terrible has happened to you

11:15.320 --> 11:17.320
And then you end up ranting for a couple minutes

11:17.320 --> 11:20.320
And then afterwards you've vented and you kind of feel okay

11:20.320 --> 11:21.320
Alright, I understand

11:21.320 --> 11:25.320
But if it really was some kind of emotional pressure release valve

11:25.320 --> 11:27.320
Why would you set up a camera?

11:27.320 --> 11:30.320
And then afterwards, why would you take that video and then edit it

11:30.320 --> 11:33.320
Maybe you add text, maybe you add music

11:33.320 --> 11:34.320
And then put it online

11:34.320 --> 11:39.320
An emotional outburst that happens in that very second I completely understand

11:39.320 --> 11:43.320
But there are multiple instances in the timeline here

11:43.320 --> 11:46.320
Where if it were truly just an outburst

11:46.320 --> 11:48.320
Rational thought should have taken hold

11:48.320 --> 11:50.320
And here's why I'm saying this

11:50.320 --> 11:53.320
This video went viral yesterday

11:57.320 --> 12:15.320
I am not saying this to be heartless

12:15.320 --> 12:19.320
Losing a pet is definitely like losing a member of your family

12:19.320 --> 12:21.320
But notice what we're looking at, okay?

12:21.320 --> 12:24.320
The snake is not in its container

12:24.320 --> 12:28.320
You can see the door to the container with the key still off to the side by her head

12:28.320 --> 12:30.320
The snake is instead on the floor

12:30.320 --> 12:35.320
She has set the camera up so that you can very clearly see the snake and her holding it

12:35.320 --> 12:36.320
She set it to record

12:36.320 --> 12:38.320
She gets herself into frame

12:38.320 --> 12:42.320
She cradles the body of her beloved pet while crying

12:42.320 --> 12:44.320
And then adds text and music to it

12:44.320 --> 12:45.320
And then uploads it

12:45.320 --> 12:48.320
What kind of person films themselves holding their dead pet

12:48.320 --> 12:50.320
And then puts it online for clout

12:50.320 --> 12:53.320
I've known people who have lost pets

12:53.320 --> 12:55.320
In fact somebody I know just lost a cat

12:55.320 --> 13:00.320
And they don't post videos and pictures of the fucking corpse

13:00.320 --> 13:02.320
They'll post pictures of them when they were alive

13:02.320 --> 13:05.320
Are we gonna be seeing shit like this with grandmas on TikTok soon?

13:05.320 --> 13:07.320
With some 12 year old trying desperately to go viral

13:07.320 --> 13:11.320
Cradles the body of their dead grandma while like angling the selfie

13:11.320 --> 13:12.320
Oh wait

13:12.320 --> 13:14.320
Yeah

13:14.320 --> 13:15.320
We've um

13:15.320 --> 13:17.320
We've already seen that haven't we

13:17.320 --> 13:18.320
It was a big deal

13:18.320 --> 13:19.320
When

13:19.320 --> 13:21.320
Was it Jake Paul or Logan Paul?

13:21.320 --> 13:22.320
I can't even remember

13:22.320 --> 13:24.320
They're both fucking terrible people

13:24.320 --> 13:30.320
But when one of them found the hanging body in the suicide forest in Japan

13:30.320 --> 13:32.320
And made a video about it

13:32.320 --> 13:33.320
And it's like

13:33.320 --> 13:34.320
Oh my god guys

13:34.320 --> 13:35.320
We found a body

13:35.320 --> 13:36.320
Isn't this crazy

13:36.320 --> 13:37.320
Clickbait thumbnails

13:37.320 --> 13:38.320
Ad revenue

13:38.320 --> 13:39.320
And it's just like

13:39.320 --> 13:40.320
Fuck off dude

13:40.320 --> 13:43.320
Is there even a scrap of humanity left in you

13:43.320 --> 13:46.320
That is what a lot of this feels like you know

13:46.320 --> 13:47.320
Now I get it

13:47.320 --> 13:48.320
Like it can be funny okay

13:48.320 --> 13:50.320
I understand that at some point there's dark humor

13:50.320 --> 13:51.320
Like the uh

13:51.320 --> 13:55.320
The guy who uses those face swap filters

13:55.320 --> 13:58.320
To swap faces with a dead body at a wake

13:58.320 --> 13:59.320
Okay

13:59.320 --> 14:00.320
On some level you just

14:00.320 --> 14:02.320
Must laugh at the absurd

14:02.320 --> 14:04.320
But that's for people uninvolved to laugh at right

14:04.320 --> 14:05.320
Like we can look at this

14:05.320 --> 14:06.320
At this photo

14:06.320 --> 14:09.320
And think it's darkly hilarious

14:09.320 --> 14:12.320
But what kind of person do you have to be to actually snap this photo

14:12.320 --> 14:14.320
In fact maybe that's part of the humor

14:14.320 --> 14:18.320
It feels kind of like social media is turning people into sociopaths

14:18.320 --> 14:19.320
If that makes sense

14:19.320 --> 14:21.320
That's a phrase I used in a previous video

14:21.320 --> 14:22.320
I can't really remember which one it is

14:22.320 --> 14:24.320
So I guess I can't link to it in a YouTube card

14:24.320 --> 14:25.320
Oops

14:25.320 --> 14:26.320
But yeah

14:26.320 --> 14:27.320
Social media is turning people into sociopaths

14:27.320 --> 14:28.320
And I definitely think a symptom of it

14:28.320 --> 14:30.320
Is that people massively overshare

14:30.320 --> 14:31.320
On what ultimately is

14:31.320 --> 14:33.320
Public social media

14:33.320 --> 14:34.320
I know it's like privately owned

14:34.320 --> 14:35.320
But by public I mean like

14:35.320 --> 14:36.320
You can access it right

14:36.320 --> 14:38.320
YouTube is a privately owned company

14:38.320 --> 14:39.320
But anyone can find your YouTube videos

14:39.320 --> 14:41.320
So it is public on that level

14:41.320 --> 14:43.320
And when someone has some private

14:43.320 --> 14:44.320
Intimate

14:44.320 --> 14:45.320
Emotional freak out

14:45.320 --> 14:47.320
And then posts it online

14:47.320 --> 14:48.320
There's um

14:48.320 --> 14:50.320
There's a shallowness to it

14:50.320 --> 14:51.320
There's a fakeness to it

14:51.320 --> 14:53.320
A manufacturedness to it

14:53.320 --> 14:55.320
It seems like these people are

14:55.320 --> 14:57.320
Ridiculously self absorbed

14:57.320 --> 14:58.320
To the point that

14:58.320 --> 15:00.320
One they cannot conceive of anybody

15:00.320 --> 15:02.320
Ever disagreeing with them on anything

15:02.320 --> 15:03.320
So when it happens they freak out

15:03.320 --> 15:05.320
And two they're ultimately posting it

15:05.320 --> 15:08.320
For validation of their ridiculous state

15:08.320 --> 15:10.320
Knowing that most people in their real life

15:10.320 --> 15:12.320
Probably wouldn't validate them

15:12.320 --> 15:13.320
In the pre-internet days

15:13.320 --> 15:15.320
If you were somebody who was a bit out to lunch

15:15.320 --> 15:16.320
At the very least the people around you

15:16.320 --> 15:18.320
Would tell you that you were out to lunch

15:18.320 --> 15:19.320
But now

15:19.320 --> 15:21.320
Now you can retreat into an echo chamber

15:21.320 --> 15:22.320
You can find like minded people

15:22.320 --> 15:23.320
Who will tell you that it's okay

15:23.320 --> 15:25.320
And that happens with politics yeah

15:25.320 --> 15:27.320
And it happens with fetishes of course

15:27.320 --> 15:29.320
But it also happens with strange things like

15:29.320 --> 15:31.320
The pro-anorexia community

15:31.320 --> 15:33.320
Where they talk about how being anorexic

15:33.320 --> 15:34.320
Is good actually

15:34.320 --> 15:35.320
And how they encourage each other

15:35.320 --> 15:37.320
To be anorexic

15:37.320 --> 15:39.320
Because it's something that non-anorexic people

15:39.320 --> 15:40.320
Can never understand

15:40.320 --> 15:41.320
It's like I said in my

15:41.320 --> 15:43.320
Consumption is identity video

15:44.320 --> 15:46.320
If you take a quality of yourself

15:46.320 --> 15:47.320
Into yourself

15:47.320 --> 15:49.320
To such an extent that you identify as it

15:49.320 --> 15:52.320
If it turns out that quality is toxic

15:52.320 --> 15:54.320
It's going to be significantly harder

15:54.320 --> 15:55.320
For you to get rid of it

15:55.320 --> 15:57.320
I think these people do have the emotions

15:57.320 --> 15:59.320
That they're portraying in these videos

15:59.320 --> 16:02.320
But one the emotions are absolutely being riled up

16:02.320 --> 16:04.320
On largely false pretenses

16:04.320 --> 16:07.320
And two they are completely incentivized

16:07.320 --> 16:09.320
To portray them in this way

16:09.320 --> 16:11.320
To indulge in the loss of self-control

16:12.320 --> 16:13.320
And you know I get it

16:13.320 --> 16:14.320
It's hard to stay grounded

16:14.320 --> 16:17.320
Like I've gained 3,000 subs in the past month

16:17.320 --> 16:19.320
And I'm really appreciative of all you guys

16:19.320 --> 16:22.320
Who are subbing and watching the videos and everything

16:22.320 --> 16:23.320
Like numbers for me are way up right now

16:23.320 --> 16:24.320
And it's great

16:24.320 --> 16:27.320
But I feel it in the back of my head

16:27.320 --> 16:29.320
That whisper that popularity means

16:29.320 --> 16:31.320
That you are greater than what you actually are

16:31.320 --> 16:32.320
And it's not true

16:32.320 --> 16:34.320
But that is what social media does to people

16:34.320 --> 16:36.320
I don't think that we're like

16:36.320 --> 16:38.320
Evolutionarily equipped

16:38.320 --> 16:41.320
To deal with seeing 100,000 likes

16:41.320 --> 16:44.320
Come in on something from 100,000 people

16:44.320 --> 16:45.320
Or alternatively

16:45.320 --> 16:47.320
To be canceled by 100,000 people

16:47.320 --> 16:49.320
For something relatively innocuous

16:49.320 --> 16:50.320
Even if it's bad

16:50.320 --> 16:51.320
But it's not like that bad

16:51.320 --> 16:54.320
Social media has ramped that shit up to the extreme

16:54.320 --> 16:55.320
And I'm not surprised

16:55.320 --> 16:58.320
People are just like collapsing

16:58.320 --> 16:59.320
Because of it

16:59.320 --> 17:01.320
Either they're collapsing from being canceled

17:01.320 --> 17:02.320
And spiraling into a depression

17:02.320 --> 17:03.320
Or alternatively

17:03.320 --> 17:05.320
They start getting way too high off their own farts

17:05.320 --> 17:07.320
Because so many people like them

17:07.320 --> 17:09.320
We live in an era where keeping yourself grounded

17:09.320 --> 17:11.320
Having some self control

17:11.320 --> 17:12.320
Stuff like truthfulness

17:12.320 --> 17:13.320
And modesty

17:13.320 --> 17:14.320
And humility

17:14.320 --> 17:16.320
These are all virtues that are needed

17:16.320 --> 17:18.320
More than ever right now

17:18.320 --> 17:21.320
And yet they are absolutely the last virtues

17:21.320 --> 17:23.320
Being cultivated by people who are

17:23.320 --> 17:25.320
Going through I guess this is

17:25.320 --> 17:27.320
The millennials version of the midlife crisis

17:27.320 --> 17:29.320
Is the social media crisis

17:29.320 --> 17:31.320
I don't think this is just an old man yells at cloud thing

17:31.320 --> 17:33.320
Though it definitely could be

17:33.320 --> 17:35.320
That's a running theme in my channel recently

17:35.320 --> 17:36.320
Is that I'm an old man

17:36.320 --> 17:38.320
But I think there's actually a problem here

17:38.320 --> 17:40.320
I think social media is creating

17:40.320 --> 17:43.320
A group of, not a generation, but a group of people

17:43.320 --> 17:45.320
That are just straight up sociopaths

17:45.320 --> 17:47.320
Triggered by the extreme ups and downs

17:47.320 --> 17:50.320
That you get from excessive social media use

17:50.320 --> 17:51.320
And while it sucks

17:51.320 --> 17:53.320
And I recommend to everyone

17:53.320 --> 17:54.320
Spend some time outside

17:54.320 --> 17:56.320
Don't stay on social media that much

17:56.320 --> 17:57.320
Still it's uh

17:57.320 --> 17:59.320
It's still a lot of fun for us

17:59.320 --> 18:01.320
You know regular people who still have their heads screwed on straight

18:01.320 --> 18:03.320
Watching these nut cases

18:03.320 --> 18:05.320
Absolutely froth at the mouth

18:05.320 --> 18:07.320
Over literally nothing

18:07.320 --> 18:09.320
Thank you for watching my friends
