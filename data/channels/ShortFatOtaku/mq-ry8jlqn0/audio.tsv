0	4000	From The Dolphin Tuna, please do a video on the education system.
4000	7520	Things have gotten really bad in Ontario, even over the past couple of years.
7520	11760	My younger siblings spend their English classes learning about marks and privilege,
11760	14400	rather than, you know, actually reading books.
14400	16880	While my time in high school wasn't too bad,
16880	19920	I'm hearing some ridiculous stuff that's changed since I graduated.
19920	25280	Like really ridiculous, racist, whack job stuff being taught in class to impressionable teenagers,
25280	29600	up to and including teachers standing up and apologizing to students of color
29600	31200	on behalf of white people.
31200	34080	Utterly ridiculous stuff that has no place in the classroom
34080	36880	if you don't want to produce a generation of prejudiced twats.
36880	38320	Well, say no more, pal.
44480	47120	In the last video, I presented the Maclean's article
47120	49120	Why Are Schools Brainwashing Our Children?
49120	51680	as an example of good writing by the magazine in the past.
51680	52880	Let's take a closer look at it.
52880	55280	To those who don't keep up with education trends,
55280	57600	certain recent events might appear to be unrelated.
57600	60400	In May, a Grade 3 class in Toronto took to the streets
60400	63200	with signs and an oversized paper mache oil pipeline
63200	66080	to protest the laying of an actual pipeline in Western Canada.
66080	70080	Last year, in Toronto, first graders brought home student planners
70080	74560	marked with the international days of zero tolerance on female genital mutilation
74560	78960	and ending violence against sex workers as a means to spark conversation on the issues.
78960	83200	In Laval, Quebec, a six-year-old boy was disqualified from a teddy bear contest
83200	88240	because a plastic Ziploc bag was found in his lunch instead of a reusable container.
88240	91360	In St. Marie de Kent, New Brunswick, in 2009,
91360	95600	Grade 4 students were given 10 minutes to decide which three people from this group
95600	98480	should be saved from an imminent planetary explosion,
98480	103680	a Black African, a Chinese person, an Aboriginal, an Acadian Francophone, and an Anglophone.
103680	105200	Here we go, right out of the gate,
105200	109600	and we're already confronting some of the most SJW corrupted nonsense I've ever seen.
109600	112320	Do you guys really think that a class of Grade 3s
112320	114880	understand the nuances in an oil pipeline debate?
114880	118800	Or that it's appropriate for Grade 1s to be talking about genital mutilation?
118800	122160	These are just a handful of examples of the more peculiar byproducts
122160	125440	of a vision gaining ground amongst many education architects,
125440	129040	an elementary school education rooted in social justice principles.
129040	132640	Interestingly, faculties of education in Canada and much of the Western world
132640	136160	are preparing their student teachers to weave social justice throughout the primary school
136160	141440	curriculum in math and science, language arts and social studies, drama and even gym class,
141440	145680	as well as into a range of cross-curricular activities, events, and projects.
145680	150000	The idea is to encourage kids to become critical analysts of contemporary issues,
150000	154480	empathetic defenders of human rights, and gatekeepers of the beleaguered earth.
154480	156320	Oh yes, that's exactly what we need.
156320	160240	We don't need to be teaching math in math class, or science in science class,
160240	162160	or literature in literature class.
162160	165840	These kids need to be learning about social justice everywhere.
166480	170560	Because how else is anybody going to buy into your blatantly false ideology
170560	173280	unless you indoctrinate them from birth like a religious sect?
173280	176560	When it comes to the question of what's appropriate to broach with young children,
176560	177600	conflicts abound.
177600	181680	Last month, Toronto parents were incensed to learn that the Toronto District School Board
181680	186480	webpage promoting health education included a link to an organization that suggested
186480	191440	kids explore their sexuality by experimenting with sex toys and vegetables.
191440	193600	Jesus Christ, just conflicts abound.
193600	194800	Nothing really to worry about here.
194800	197920	It's just two groups having a minor disagreement over a policy.
197920	202080	It's not the school board, an arm of the Ministry of Education, the Canadian government,
202080	205520	telling kids to buy sex toys and masturbate with vegetables.
205520	209200	Obviously I've got nothing against sex toys, but kids are going to discover
209200	211120	masturbation on their own anyway.
211120	213680	They don't need government guidance on the topic.
213680	217280	I mean honestly, did the lunatic over at the Toronto School Board who decided to put this
217280	221120	up have a problem figuring out how to jack off as a kid without the school getting involved?
221120	223280	Like the article said, the Toronto District School Board,
223280	225520	since taken down its sex advice for kids section.
225520	227760	But as you know, the internet never forgets.
227760	232000	The website's not on the internet wayback machine, but due to the hundreds of articles
232000	235200	published about this story, it wasn't hard to dig up some screencaps.
235200	238480	This is about the best image of the page in question that I could find.
238480	242160	I don't know why the original creator of this image put the red arrow where he did,
242160	244720	because the link in question is this one down here.
244720	246960	The Coalition for Positive Sexuality.
246960	251840	And because their website, positive.org, is still up, I've been able to find the page
251840	253840	that the Toronto District School Board linked to.
253840	258160	Let's uh, let's just see what exactly they've been recommending to kids for ourselves.
258160	261760	Most of us learn that sex means a man on top of a woman,
261760	263760	and that the only other choice is abstinence.
263760	265120	But sex can be lots of things.
265120	268000	Women have sex with women, men have sex with men,
268000	271200	women have sex with men, and sometimes the best sex is with yourself.
271200	272800	Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.
272800	277200	There are lots of safe and fun ways to get off, which you probably won't learn in school.
277200	279040	Well, that's certainly not true anymore, isn't it?
279040	286080	You could suck, kiss, touch, bite, fondle, nibble, squeeze, and lick someone's body,
286080	292160	nipples, calves, toes, neck, ass, dick, or vulva, jerk yourself off or each other off,
292160	296560	dry or using lots of lubricant, kiss for a long time using lots of tongue,
296560	301440	have sex in front of mirrors, or watch each other jerk off, get into roleplay,
301440	305760	for instance tie someone up and pleasure them, look at sexy pictures and videos,
305760	310560	make up or act out fantasies, talk dirty, dress up, strip down, or cross-dress,
310560	313520	dressing in the clothes of the other gender, just remember that traps are gay,
313520	318960	call your friend and tell him or her your hottest fantasies, if you want to lose a friend, sure,
318960	324640	use cock rings, nipple clamps, or clothespins, or vibrators on your own or someone else's body,
324640	329200	I guess this is the kraut and tea section, shower together or grind against each other with your
329200	336080	clothes on, dry humping, come on someone's belly, back, feet, chest, instead of in them,
336080	341200	play with your own or someone else's ass or vagina, put your fingers, dildos,
341200	346160	vegetables, or butt plugs into them, yes, let's tell kids to put cucumbers in their ass,
346160	348800	this will turn out well, if you're putting something into a butthole,
349600	352880	make sure it has a flared base and looks something like the picture,
352880	357200	that way it can't go all the way in and get stuck, why thank you, thank you for that picture,
357200	360640	I'm sure a 6 year old is going to look at that, remember his old soother,
360640	364880	and go try something stupid, fucking incredible, let's get back to the mclean's article,
364880	368720	between the mounting examples of how social justice education can go wrong,
368720	371920	and the passionate defenses from those responsible for training teachers,
371920	374640	the fight is growing over what's going on in primary classrooms,
374640	378080	it's proponents argue that today's students are especially in need of it,
378080	382000	a growing mandate to integrate special education students into mainstream classrooms,
382000	385760	requires better understanding from children, a new awareness of the effects of bullying,
385760	389280	puts the onus on teachers to inculcate empathy in students,
389280	392960	and increased diversity in the classroom can fuel intolerance from all sides,
392960	397280	so from what I can gather, the argument here is that some people want social justice in grade
397280	401760	school in Canada, because simply teaching math and literature and science isn't enough to provide
401760	406720	a cultural bulwark against nazi style authoritarianism, they actually use that example
406720	411200	in the article, and a morals based education would provide for racial diversity, it would
411200	414640	help stop bullying, and it would create a more empathetic generation of people,
414640	418000	the counter argument, which is also given its fair shake in the article,
418000	423040	is that math class is for math, not morality, there are plenty of other classes like drama,
423040	426480	arts, or literature, that can provide a philosophical or moral background,
426480	428960	which I personally believe is an important part of education,
428960	431200	but there's no place for it in the hard sciences,
431200	434560	I obviously find the second position more appealing than the first, and here's why,
434560	438880	when the proponents of social justice education say that their education is morals based,
438880	442240	I just don't believe them, I don't believe them because they show grade fours,
442240	445520	pictures of dead gorillas in the Congo, as a part of the curriculum of human's
445520	449760	effects on the environment, I don't believe them because a grade five math lesson involved
449760	453600	calculating the amount the Canadian government spent on the war in Afghanistan, the amount it
453600	459520	spends on poverty, and the lesson, a math lesson, culminated in a letter writing campaign to elected
459520	463520	MPs, I'm not saying these topics can't be talked about at all, there's legitimate discussion to
463520	468240	be had here, but not with kids, not when they're in a school system that prioritizes performance
468240	472240	and regurgitation over actual learning and critical thinking, they're meant to be learning
472240	477120	the skills and tools to tackle the tough problems later in life, not indoctrinated into tackling
477120	481200	them right now in exactly the way the teacher, the school board, or the government wants them to,
481200	485600	I'll discuss this more in detail in the next part, but I think it's pertinent to point out here,
485600	489760	that Canadian grade schools are forcing controversial topics of discussion onto
489760	494880	children when it's inappropriate to do so, while Canadian universities are censoring controversial
494880	499520	topics of discussion when it's legal adults in the room, not kids, and as we've seen with the
499520	503680	Lindsay Shepherd situation, they're doing it with the justification that the students are just too
503680	508000	young to be able to handle it, so what the hell is driving all of this? Margaret Wente over at
508000	512400	the Globe and Mail has a hypothesis to offer up in her article, Your New School Curriculum,
512400	518320	Social Justice for All, equality is no longer the goal, the new goal is equity, a very different
518320	522560	concept, according to a sweeping draft plan prepared for the Toronto District School Board,
522560	527440	equity is not achieved by treating students fairly, it is achieved by challenging entrenched
527440	531760	systems of power and privilege, and constantly working to center the conversation around the
531760	537280	effects of inequity, oppression, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia,
537280	541280	and other forms of hate and discrimination specifically for racialized students.
541280	545600	In other words, kids' success or failure is shaped by historic forces that determine
545600	551120	their victim status. The vexed question of why some racialized students do extremely well,
551120	555360	and others not so well, is not addressed. Equality means treating everyone equally,
555360	560240	removing all institutional barriers to success, and letting people succeed or fail based on their
560240	564400	merits and their hard work. Equity, at least the way the Toronto District School Board has
564400	568560	defined it, is about making sure everybody's results are the same, nobody does too poorly
568560	572480	compared to the norm, nobody does too well compared to the norm, everybody's just the same.
572480	577200	It's a reframing of the equality of opportunity versus equality of outcome debate. If you believe
577200	581520	in the idea that individual people are different from one another, and by the way, this idea is
581520	586320	known as the truth, then somewhere down the line those differences will lead to different outcomes
586320	591040	in what those individuals choose to do with their lives, both in terms of what they devote themselves
591040	595920	to, and how good they are at doing it. If there's no institutional barriers put in the way of this
595920	600640	process, that's equality of opportunity. That's freedom. And there's always going to be at least
600640	605120	a little bit of inherent inequality in a free society, because freedom means people are free
605120	609920	to make the wrong choices in life, or even the right choices that are simply less optimized in
609920	614160	practice. Meanwhile, the proponents of equality of outcome state that in a system where there's
614160	619280	no institutional barriers in place, all outcomes will naturally be the same. This is because they
619280	623840	believe there's no fundamental differences between individuals, so that all human beings should be
623840	628400	able to do roughly the same thing. And if they don't, it's because institutional barriers still
628400	633040	exist, hidden somewhere, and it's the job of society to remove them. Remember back in my video
633040	637920	Why Capitalism is a Success, I made a remark to the effect that socialists and communists
637920	641840	don't take into account human passion when ordering the production of their societies.
641840	647040	Equality of outcome is the practical reality of that theory. And when played out in the real world,
647040	651440	it amounts to the flattening of people's lives. Margaret Wente describes this in relation to
651440	656080	Canada's public schools. One mother wrote me that social justice and equity are now the focus of her
656080	660720	son's school. At parent council meetings, they talk about microaggressions. There is no room,
660720	665520	it seems, for white children or mixed children, she lamented. Her children are mixed.
665520	670720	In the name of social justice, grade nine math is being de-streamed. De-streaming is a big deal
670720	675600	these days. Streaming is unjust, we're told, because kids in the applied stream are less
675600	679840	successful at math than kids in the academic stream. This is attributed not to their lower
679840	684720	math skills, but to structural elements that divide students. Putting the applied kids in
684720	689600	the academic stream will raise their aspirations, their self-esteem, and therefore their results.
689600	694560	As Ontario's new equity plan says confidently, given the opportunity and the right supports,
694560	698000	all students can succeed in the academic stream. For those of you who don't know,
698000	702160	classes are divided into two levels in high school over here, applied and academic. This
702160	705920	doesn't include special education or gifted education. Applied and academic are the two
705920	710000	categories for the general population. Applied classes are meant to teach practical knowledge
710000	714240	that can be used in a trade school or a blue collar job, while academic classes teach the
714240	719120	same content and the same topics, but tailored for a university, business, or research setting.
719120	723280	At least, that's how it was when I was in high school. Now the classes are being de-streamed,
723280	727200	and everybody's being forced into one class regardless of their skills, their intelligence,
727200	731360	their prior education, or their goals after they've left the school. And it's being done
731360	735600	not because of budget cuts, it's being done because of social justice. Because if the
735600	740480	academic classes are privileged, then equality of outcome demands that everybody be in them,
740480	744000	and if some students underperform, it's blamed on institutional barriers.
744000	746880	The results of this new program are exactly as you'd expect.
746880	750480	Here's what will happen with de-streaming, wrote Don Cooper, a retired teacher,
750480	751920	in a letter to the Toronto Star.
751920	756160	Grade 9 teachers will be faced with a classroom with more academic and social disparity,
756160	760880	which will be much more difficult to educate. Translation, struggling kids will be the losers.
760880	765040	All of those underprivileged kids that this social justice nonsense is supposed to help,
765040	768480	they're the ones who are going to suffer the ill effects of it. A huge predictor of problems
768480	773360	at school, more than race, gender, sexuality, or whatever, is the stability of the family home,
773360	777760	and no amount of anti-bias training on the part of the teachers or social justice-infused
777760	781200	curriculums in the classroom are going to help with that. And you know what? People
781200	785120	wanting to escape this nonsense are probably just going to be shit out of luck. Ontario
785120	789360	parents uncomfortable with social justice education may have nowhere else to go. Well,
789360	794400	of course not. What use would a massive propaganda vehicle be if people could simply opt out of it?
794400	798080	Few parents would object to schools trying to teach children about the importance of respecting
798080	801680	others and the harms caused by discrimination. But there's no consensus on the definition of
801680	805120	some of the problems the social justice curriculum aims to identify and stamp out,
805120	808880	so teaching could easily cross the line from education to political indoctrination.
808880	813120	It's easy to imagine how teaching on these issues could go off the rails at an elementary school
813120	817120	if teachers view the inculcation of a particular worldview as part of their job. Moreover,
817120	822240	the rise of social justice education may squeeze out other proven approaches to character education
822240	826880	focused primarily on developing student resilience and accountability. That's actually a good point.
826880	831680	Social justice and taking responsibility for your life are two incompatible points of view.
831680	835520	Social justice teaches that if you're a victim, it's not your fault. It's your parents, or it's
835520	839760	societies, or it's the schools, or it's the patriarchy. If you're not reaching your potential,
839760	844560	some kind of power structure exists that's keeping you down. However, when you take responsibility
844560	848640	for your life, the social justice theory has to go out the window. Taking responsibility doesn't
848640	852320	mean that you're not a victim. It doesn't mean that where you came from isn't real or that what
852320	856640	happened to you is your fault. It simply means that you say, regardless of what happened in my
856640	862560	past, what's been done to me unjustly, I'm going to do the best I can right now to own my actions,
862560	866560	my reactions, my thoughts and feelings, and I'm going to do the best I can with what I have.
866560	871200	Social justice emphasizes that because you were wronged, somebody else needs to take action to
871200	875760	fix you. But personal responsibility emphasizes that even if it's somebody else's fault,
875760	879760	even if it's not right or fair, you've got to fix your own life as best you can.
879760	884160	This article mentions that the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario is increasingly
884160	888480	relying on a resource titled, Social Justice Begins With Me. Let's take a look at some of
888480	892480	the sample pages of this curriculum. Here's one based around the children's book, A Shelter in
892480	896400	Our Car. The book's about a homeless Jamaican family that live out of a car. I'm actually not
896400	901200	opposed to children's books like this. Children's books from my childhood and earlier routinely
901200	905760	evoked sadness or anger, but they were tailored towards kids. I don't know if A Shelter in Our
905760	909680	Car is tailored towards kids or not, but check out the lesson plan. Investigate the roles that
909680	913920	racism and gender discrimination play in unemployment and in salary inequity. How much
913920	918800	money do women make in comparison to men? What is the situation for racialized women? I guess grade
918800	923360	five is young enough for wage gap indoctrination according to this program. I would presume that
923360	927600	the characters in this book make less money than the norm not because they're black, Jamaican or
927600	931440	women, but because they live in a fucking car. But saying that in class might get you sent to
931440	936320	the principal's office. Also, what pleb wrote this? You don't need the feature-related bit in
936320	941200	the YouTube URL. Were you just clicking around YouTube finding related SJW links and dumping
941200	945600	them into the program as fast as you could? I've been talking primarily about Ontario schools,
945600	950640	but this is happening coast to coast in Canada. For example, Social Justice 12 is currently
950640	954960	offered in British Columbia high schools. This is an exciting elective course that is currently
954960	959200	being offered in some school districts in BC. It was approved by the Ministry of Education in
959200	964000	August 2008. What is social justice? Social justice is the assurance that the basic human
964000	968800	rights of all people are upheld. Examine social justice issues such as racism, homophobia,
968800	972960	sexism, poverty, and globalization. This course will offer you the opportunity to look at the
972960	977200	causes and consequences of oppression and injustice both in Canada and globally.
977200	981440	Challenge yourself to become an educated, fair, and open-minded global citizen. There's a lot
981440	984720	wrong here, but getting into it would just be retreading old ground at this point. I'll just
984720	989280	point this one thing out. This curriculum considers globalization a social justice issue
989280	993920	on the level of racism and sexism, but also invites the reader to be a global citizen.
993920	998800	Recognize the problem in the classroom, but take your place as a worker drone afterward, you husk.
998800	1003440	Challenge yourself to become an ethical, socially responsible global citizen. This is a case study
1003440	1009040	and research-based course. There is no final exam, but a final action project will be required of all
1009040	1014080	students. Oh, excellent. No final exam. Just go do a protest or something. Man, I would have had a
1014080	1018160	fuckload of fun with this back in high school, let me tell you. Even back then I was a bit of
1018160	1024000	a shitlord. In Abbotsford back in 2008, the school board decided to ban the social justice 12 class.
1024000	1028800	At least that's what the social justice 12 page says. Watch this video to gain an understanding
1028800	1032400	on the social justice 12 conference in Abbotsford. Alright, let's take a look.
1044080	1051440	Whoa, that's a woke take, isn't it? Yes, valuing equality in your school system will make people
1051440	1059520	want to be treated equally, and you can't have that, can you? I bet this guy turned out to be
1059520	1072960	a cutie Asian trap due to all this shit. Oh, it's actually a girl. My bad, ma'am. Sir. Sure.
1072960	1077280	So what was the Abbotsford school board's reasoning for banning social justice 12?
1077280	1082480	Well, this article from September 19th, 2008, from the Vancouver Sun, states that Abbotsford
1082480	1087040	school district has ordered its schools not to offer a controversial new elective course
1087040	1091680	called social justice 12 until it has a chance to review the content. So it was never banned,
1091680	1095840	they just wanted a chance to examine the course for themselves. That would make sense,
1095840	1102000	since social justice 12 was only devised one month earlier in August 2008. On October 9th,
1102000	1105840	2008, the Abbotsford school board began discussions over social justice 12,
1105840	1110560	and by February 10th, 2009, they had decided to allow it in their schools the following fall.
1110560	1115040	The school board's desire to examine for themselves the content of a newly created
1115040	1120160	optional curriculum and not simply blindly going forward with it generated protests like these.
1120160	1125600	Your ideological pet projects are not and should not be immune to a process of review,
1125600	1129440	you fucking zombies. And of course, I also have a copy of social justice 12,
1129440	1133280	let's take a peek inside. This stuff is vague enough that I can really see some young
1133280	1137600	MRA or something co-opting the whole thing for shits and giggles. But this bit at the bottom,
1137600	1142880	opportunities for lifelong participation in social justice? I guess this class expects to just churn
1142880	1147920	out obedient little SJWs who will go on to obey the diversity centres of their universities and
1147920	1152640	the diversity officers of their workplaces. Here's a task a class may be given to discuss and present
1152640	1157120	an answer about. Formulate a response to ethical questions related to social justice. Example,
1157120	1161440	are morals and values absolute? Do the ends justify the means? Should there be limitations
1161440	1165680	on freedom of expression? What rights should humans have over animals? Is there such a thing
1165680	1170240	as a just war? What responsibility do individuals have to consider the common good? How does one
1170240	1174880	reconcile a conflict of values or rights? This is stuff that you'd expect from a philosophy class,
1174880	1180080	but that's the point. Social justice sees itself as the natural replacement to philosophy. A
1180080	1185120	philosophy degree might qualify you for a job at Starbucks, but philosophy itself is important.
1185120	1190320	It's why science or engineering degrees generally require one credit in applied ethics of philosophy,
1190320	1194080	not necessarily for broad-based learning, but because it's important to understand
1194080	1198480	why you're doing something almost as much as how you're doing it. Philosophy gives us our moral
1198480	1203200	guidance, our ethical underpinning, and social justice wants to co-op that spot in our society
1203200	1207120	in order to push its own agenda. Don't believe me? Check out this question in the next section.
1207120	1211440	Identify the types of decisions made by government that promote the common good. Example,
1211440	1215840	non-smoking legislation, legislation against drunk driving, gun control legislation, freedom of
1215840	1220240	information, worker protection. You can't simply assume that these pieces of legislation promote
1220240	1224480	the common good. There's certainly well-reasoned arguments for them being in the common good,
1224480	1228880	but there's also well-reasoned arguments for them being against the common good. But while that
1228880	1233840	debate might have been allowed in philosophy or ethics, it's not in social justice 12. There's
1233840	1238720	more examples than ever of this bullshit right now. The making space program, seeing the rainbow,
1238720	1243600	and so on. Canadian public schools are SJW-ifying everything, and we're already beginning to see
1243600	1248160	the negative effects. A Greek Orthodox Christian has been battling his school board in court for
1248160	1253760	seven years, not to try and stop LGBT content from being taught at the school his kids attend,
1253760	1258080	and not even to have the authority to pull his kids from those classes on a pick-and-choose basis,
1258080	1264240	despite some misleading headlines in the matter, but to simply be informed by the school when LGBT
1264240	1269040	content was specifically going to be covered before the day of class. And the school refused.
1269040	1274160	And he lost his court case, with the judge ruling that simply declaring his parental authority in
1274160	1278960	the matter would oversimplify common law principles that were not in dispute. The judge
1278960	1283200	also quipped that he can simply pull his kids from public schooling entirely if he has a problem with
1283200	1287440	it. Well that's a really shitty fucking answer, but more importantly, I would not be surprised if
1287440	1292000	that stops being an option for parents in the near future. There's also a financial cost as well.
1292000	1296880	Schools in Canada are going broke. With some teachers resorting to crowdfunding classes,
1296880	1301200	Curtis Wiebe has only been teaching for four years, but he's already an old hand when it
1301200	1305760	comes to using technology to engage his grade six and grade seven students. But the way he and
1305760	1309200	others like him are funding the necessary classroom equipment is making some people
1309200	1314240	extremely uneasy. Wiebe is making his classroom a learning lab thanks to a set of small programmable
1314240	1318800	robots he recently received from a four-year-old Toronto-based charity called My Class Needs.
1318800	1323680	Next on his wish list, virtual reality headsets to make learning literally out of this world for
1323680	1327760	students to realize his dream of helping his pupils experience what Mars is like. The charity
1327760	1332400	says it has improved the learning environment for more than 88,000 kids in public schools in Canada,
1332400	1336720	but critics say it's also furthering inequality in the public school system and opening the door
1336720	1341120	to letting private money replace government dollars. It sounds to me like private money
1341120	1345520	is augmenting government dollars, not replacing them. It also sounds to me like these cries of
1345520	1350000	furthering inequality are just jealousy. Wiebe's found a way to get extra resources for his
1350000	1355200	classes. He's not taking anything away from other classes in order to do this. He's not driving down
1355200	1359680	the quality of anybody else's education. When somebody cries inequality because somebody else
1359680	1364320	is improving themselves or their station, it just sounds petty. But most importantly of all,
1364320	1367840	why are Canadian public schools having to resort to crowdfunding in the first place?
1367840	1371280	Surely there's enough money to go around. Maybe there's a few useless programs out there we can
1371280	1374800	afford to cut. I can't really think of any, though.
