00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
From The Dolphin Tuna, please do a video on the education system.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,520
Things have gotten really bad in Ontario, even over the past couple of years.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,760
My younger siblings spend their English classes learning about marks and privilege,

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,400
rather than, you know, actually reading books.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,880
While my time in high school wasn't too bad,

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,920
I'm hearing some ridiculous stuff that's changed since I graduated.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,280
Like really ridiculous, racist, whack job stuff being taught in class to impressionable teenagers,

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,600
up to and including teachers standing up and apologizing to students of color

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,200
on behalf of white people.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,080
Utterly ridiculous stuff that has no place in the classroom

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,880
if you don't want to produce a generation of prejudiced twats.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,320
Well, say no more, pal.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,120
In the last video, I presented the Maclean's article

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Why Are Schools Brainwashing Our Children?

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,680
as an example of good writing by the magazine in the past.

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,880
Let's take a closer look at it.

17
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,280
To those who don't keep up with education trends,

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,600
certain recent events might appear to be unrelated.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,400
In May, a Grade 3 class in Toronto took to the streets

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,200
with signs and an oversized paper mache oil pipeline

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,080
to protest the laying of an actual pipeline in Western Canada.

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Last year, in Toronto, first graders brought home student planners

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,560
marked with the international days of zero tolerance on female genital mutilation

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,960
and ending violence against sex workers as a means to spark conversation on the issues.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,200
In Laval, Quebec, a six-year-old boy was disqualified from a teddy bear contest

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,240
because a plastic Ziploc bag was found in his lunch instead of a reusable container.

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,360
In St. Marie de Kent, New Brunswick, in 2009,

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,600
Grade 4 students were given 10 minutes to decide which three people from this group

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,480
should be saved from an imminent planetary explosion,

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,680
a Black African, a Chinese person, an Aboriginal, an Acadian Francophone, and an Anglophone.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,200
Here we go, right out of the gate,

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
and we're already confronting some of the most SJW corrupted nonsense I've ever seen.

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,320
Do you guys really think that a class of Grade 3s

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,880
understand the nuances in an oil pipeline debate?

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,800
Or that it's appropriate for Grade 1s to be talking about genital mutilation?

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,160
These are just a handful of examples of the more peculiar byproducts

37
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,440
of a vision gaining ground amongst many education architects,

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,040
an elementary school education rooted in social justice principles.

39
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,640
Interestingly, faculties of education in Canada and much of the Western world

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,160
are preparing their student teachers to weave social justice throughout the primary school

41
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,440
curriculum in math and science, language arts and social studies, drama and even gym class,

42
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,680
as well as into a range of cross-curricular activities, events, and projects.

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,000
The idea is to encourage kids to become critical analysts of contemporary issues,

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,480
empathetic defenders of human rights, and gatekeepers of the beleaguered earth.

45
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,320
Oh yes, that's exactly what we need.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,240
We don't need to be teaching math in math class, or science in science class,

47
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,160
or literature in literature class.

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,840
These kids need to be learning about social justice everywhere.

49
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,560
Because how else is anybody going to buy into your blatantly false ideology

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,280
unless you indoctrinate them from birth like a religious sect?

51
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,560
When it comes to the question of what's appropriate to broach with young children,

52
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,600
conflicts abound.

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,680
Last month, Toronto parents were incensed to learn that the Toronto District School Board

54
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,480
webpage promoting health education included a link to an organization that suggested

55
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,440
kids explore their sexuality by experimenting with sex toys and vegetables.

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,600
Jesus Christ, just conflicts abound.

57
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,800
Nothing really to worry about here.

58
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,920
It's just two groups having a minor disagreement over a policy.

59
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,080
It's not the school board, an arm of the Ministry of Education, the Canadian government,

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,520
telling kids to buy sex toys and masturbate with vegetables.

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,200
Obviously I've got nothing against sex toys, but kids are going to discover

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,120
masturbation on their own anyway.

63
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,680
They don't need government guidance on the topic.

64
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,280
I mean honestly, did the lunatic over at the Toronto School Board who decided to put this

65
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,120
up have a problem figuring out how to jack off as a kid without the school getting involved?

66
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,280
Like the article said, the Toronto District School Board,

67
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,520
since taken down its sex advice for kids section.

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,760
But as you know, the internet never forgets.

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,000
The website's not on the internet wayback machine, but due to the hundreds of articles

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,200
published about this story, it wasn't hard to dig up some screencaps.

71
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,480
This is about the best image of the page in question that I could find.

72
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,160
I don't know why the original creator of this image put the red arrow where he did,

73
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,720
because the link in question is this one down here.

74
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,960
The Coalition for Positive Sexuality.

75
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,840
And because their website, positive.org, is still up, I've been able to find the page

76
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,840
that the Toronto District School Board linked to.

77
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,160
Let's uh, let's just see what exactly they've been recommending to kids for ourselves.

78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,760
Most of us learn that sex means a man on top of a woman,

79
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,760
and that the only other choice is abstinence.

80
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,120
But sex can be lots of things.

81
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,000
Women have sex with women, men have sex with men,

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,200
women have sex with men, and sometimes the best sex is with yourself.

83
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,800
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.

84
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,200
There are lots of safe and fun ways to get off, which you probably won't learn in school.

85
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,040
Well, that's certainly not true anymore, isn't it?

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,080
You could suck, kiss, touch, bite, fondle, nibble, squeeze, and lick someone's body,

87
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,160
nipples, calves, toes, neck, ass, dick, or vulva, jerk yourself off or each other off,

88
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,560
dry or using lots of lubricant, kiss for a long time using lots of tongue,

89
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,440
have sex in front of mirrors, or watch each other jerk off, get into roleplay,

90
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,760
for instance tie someone up and pleasure them, look at sexy pictures and videos,

91
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,560
make up or act out fantasies, talk dirty, dress up, strip down, or cross-dress,

92
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,520
dressing in the clothes of the other gender, just remember that traps are gay,

93
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,960
call your friend and tell him or her your hottest fantasies, if you want to lose a friend, sure,

94
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,640
use cock rings, nipple clamps, or clothespins, or vibrators on your own or someone else's body,

95
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,200
I guess this is the kraut and tea section, shower together or grind against each other with your

96
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:36,080
clothes on, dry humping, come on someone's belly, back, feet, chest, instead of in them,

97
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,200
play with your own or someone else's ass or vagina, put your fingers, dildos,

98
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,160
vegetables, or butt plugs into them, yes, let's tell kids to put cucumbers in their ass,

99
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,800
this will turn out well, if you're putting something into a butthole,

100
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,880
make sure it has a flared base and looks something like the picture,

101
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,200
that way it can't go all the way in and get stuck, why thank you, thank you for that picture,

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,640
I'm sure a 6 year old is going to look at that, remember his old soother,

103
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,880
and go try something stupid, fucking incredible, let's get back to the mclean's article,

104
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,720
between the mounting examples of how social justice education can go wrong,

105
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,920
and the passionate defenses from those responsible for training teachers,

106
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,640
the fight is growing over what's going on in primary classrooms,

107
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,080
it's proponents argue that today's students are especially in need of it,

108
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,000
a growing mandate to integrate special education students into mainstream classrooms,

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,760
requires better understanding from children, a new awareness of the effects of bullying,

110
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,280
puts the onus on teachers to inculcate empathy in students,

111
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,960
and increased diversity in the classroom can fuel intolerance from all sides,

112
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,280
so from what I can gather, the argument here is that some people want social justice in grade

113
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,760
school in Canada, because simply teaching math and literature and science isn't enough to provide

114
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,720
a cultural bulwark against nazi style authoritarianism, they actually use that example

115
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,200
in the article, and a morals based education would provide for racial diversity, it would

116
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,640
help stop bullying, and it would create a more empathetic generation of people,

117
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,000
the counter argument, which is also given its fair shake in the article,

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,040
is that math class is for math, not morality, there are plenty of other classes like drama,

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,480
arts, or literature, that can provide a philosophical or moral background,

120
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,960
which I personally believe is an important part of education,

121
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,200
but there's no place for it in the hard sciences,

122
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,560
I obviously find the second position more appealing than the first, and here's why,

123
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,880
when the proponents of social justice education say that their education is morals based,

124
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,240
I just don't believe them, I don't believe them because they show grade fours,

125
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,520
pictures of dead gorillas in the Congo, as a part of the curriculum of human's

126
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,760
effects on the environment, I don't believe them because a grade five math lesson involved

127
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,600
calculating the amount the Canadian government spent on the war in Afghanistan, the amount it

128
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,520
spends on poverty, and the lesson, a math lesson, culminated in a letter writing campaign to elected

129
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,520
MPs, I'm not saying these topics can't be talked about at all, there's legitimate discussion to

130
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,240
be had here, but not with kids, not when they're in a school system that prioritizes performance

131
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,240
and regurgitation over actual learning and critical thinking, they're meant to be learning

132
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,120
the skills and tools to tackle the tough problems later in life, not indoctrinated into tackling

133
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,200
them right now in exactly the way the teacher, the school board, or the government wants them to,

134
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,600
I'll discuss this more in detail in the next part, but I think it's pertinent to point out here,

135
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,760
that Canadian grade schools are forcing controversial topics of discussion onto

136
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,880
children when it's inappropriate to do so, while Canadian universities are censoring controversial

137
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,520
topics of discussion when it's legal adults in the room, not kids, and as we've seen with the

138
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,680
Lindsay Shepherd situation, they're doing it with the justification that the students are just too

139
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,000
young to be able to handle it, so what the hell is driving all of this? Margaret Wente over at

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,400
the Globe and Mail has a hypothesis to offer up in her article, Your New School Curriculum,

141
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,320
Social Justice for All, equality is no longer the goal, the new goal is equity, a very different

142
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,560
concept, according to a sweeping draft plan prepared for the Toronto District School Board,

143
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,440
equity is not achieved by treating students fairly, it is achieved by challenging entrenched

144
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,760
systems of power and privilege, and constantly working to center the conversation around the

145
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,280
effects of inequity, oppression, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia,

146
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,280
and other forms of hate and discrimination specifically for racialized students.

147
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,600
In other words, kids' success or failure is shaped by historic forces that determine

148
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,120
their victim status. The vexed question of why some racialized students do extremely well,

149
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,360
and others not so well, is not addressed. Equality means treating everyone equally,

150
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,240
removing all institutional barriers to success, and letting people succeed or fail based on their

151
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,400
merits and their hard work. Equity, at least the way the Toronto District School Board has

152
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,560
defined it, is about making sure everybody's results are the same, nobody does too poorly

153
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,480
compared to the norm, nobody does too well compared to the norm, everybody's just the same.

154
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,200
It's a reframing of the equality of opportunity versus equality of outcome debate. If you believe

155
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,520
in the idea that individual people are different from one another, and by the way, this idea is

156
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,320
known as the truth, then somewhere down the line those differences will lead to different outcomes

157
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,040
in what those individuals choose to do with their lives, both in terms of what they devote themselves

158
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,920
to, and how good they are at doing it. If there's no institutional barriers put in the way of this

159
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,640
process, that's equality of opportunity. That's freedom. And there's always going to be at least

160
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,120
a little bit of inherent inequality in a free society, because freedom means people are free

161
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,920
to make the wrong choices in life, or even the right choices that are simply less optimized in

162
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,160
practice. Meanwhile, the proponents of equality of outcome state that in a system where there's

163
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,280
no institutional barriers in place, all outcomes will naturally be the same. This is because they

164
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,840
believe there's no fundamental differences between individuals, so that all human beings should be

165
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,400
able to do roughly the same thing. And if they don't, it's because institutional barriers still

166
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,040
exist, hidden somewhere, and it's the job of society to remove them. Remember back in my video

167
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,920
Why Capitalism is a Success, I made a remark to the effect that socialists and communists

168
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,840
don't take into account human passion when ordering the production of their societies.

169
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,040
Equality of outcome is the practical reality of that theory. And when played out in the real world,

170
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,440
it amounts to the flattening of people's lives. Margaret Wente describes this in relation to

171
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,080
Canada's public schools. One mother wrote me that social justice and equity are now the focus of her

172
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,720
son's school. At parent council meetings, they talk about microaggressions. There is no room,

173
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,520
it seems, for white children or mixed children, she lamented. Her children are mixed.

174
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,720
In the name of social justice, grade nine math is being de-streamed. De-streaming is a big deal

175
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,600
these days. Streaming is unjust, we're told, because kids in the applied stream are less

176
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,840
successful at math than kids in the academic stream. This is attributed not to their lower

177
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,720
math skills, but to structural elements that divide students. Putting the applied kids in

178
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,600
the academic stream will raise their aspirations, their self-esteem, and therefore their results.

179
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,560
As Ontario's new equity plan says confidently, given the opportunity and the right supports,

180
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,000
all students can succeed in the academic stream. For those of you who don't know,

181
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,160
classes are divided into two levels in high school over here, applied and academic. This

182
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,920
doesn't include special education or gifted education. Applied and academic are the two

183
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,000
categories for the general population. Applied classes are meant to teach practical knowledge

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,240
that can be used in a trade school or a blue collar job, while academic classes teach the

185
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,120
same content and the same topics, but tailored for a university, business, or research setting.

186
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,280
At least, that's how it was when I was in high school. Now the classes are being de-streamed,

187
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,200
and everybody's being forced into one class regardless of their skills, their intelligence,

188
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,360
their prior education, or their goals after they've left the school. And it's being done

189
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,600
not because of budget cuts, it's being done because of social justice. Because if the

190
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,480
academic classes are privileged, then equality of outcome demands that everybody be in them,

191
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,000
and if some students underperform, it's blamed on institutional barriers.

192
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,880
The results of this new program are exactly as you'd expect.

193
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,480
Here's what will happen with de-streaming, wrote Don Cooper, a retired teacher,

194
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,920
in a letter to the Toronto Star.

195
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,160
Grade 9 teachers will be faced with a classroom with more academic and social disparity,

196
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,880
which will be much more difficult to educate. Translation, struggling kids will be the losers.

197
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,040
All of those underprivileged kids that this social justice nonsense is supposed to help,

198
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,480
they're the ones who are going to suffer the ill effects of it. A huge predictor of problems

199
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,360
at school, more than race, gender, sexuality, or whatever, is the stability of the family home,

200
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,760
and no amount of anti-bias training on the part of the teachers or social justice-infused

201
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,200
curriculums in the classroom are going to help with that. And you know what? People

202
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,120
wanting to escape this nonsense are probably just going to be shit out of luck. Ontario

203
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,360
parents uncomfortable with social justice education may have nowhere else to go. Well,

204
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,400
of course not. What use would a massive propaganda vehicle be if people could simply opt out of it?

205
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,080
Few parents would object to schools trying to teach children about the importance of respecting

206
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,680
others and the harms caused by discrimination. But there's no consensus on the definition of

207
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,120
some of the problems the social justice curriculum aims to identify and stamp out,

208
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,880
so teaching could easily cross the line from education to political indoctrination.

209
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,120
It's easy to imagine how teaching on these issues could go off the rails at an elementary school

210
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,120
if teachers view the inculcation of a particular worldview as part of their job. Moreover,

211
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,240
the rise of social justice education may squeeze out other proven approaches to character education

212
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,880
focused primarily on developing student resilience and accountability. That's actually a good point.

213
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,680
Social justice and taking responsibility for your life are two incompatible points of view.

214
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,520
Social justice teaches that if you're a victim, it's not your fault. It's your parents, or it's

215
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,760
societies, or it's the schools, or it's the patriarchy. If you're not reaching your potential,

216
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,560
some kind of power structure exists that's keeping you down. However, when you take responsibility

217
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,640
for your life, the social justice theory has to go out the window. Taking responsibility doesn't

218
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,320
mean that you're not a victim. It doesn't mean that where you came from isn't real or that what

219
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,640
happened to you is your fault. It simply means that you say, regardless of what happened in my

220
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:22,560
past, what's been done to me unjustly, I'm going to do the best I can right now to own my actions,

221
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,560
my reactions, my thoughts and feelings, and I'm going to do the best I can with what I have.

222
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,200
Social justice emphasizes that because you were wronged, somebody else needs to take action to

223
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,760
fix you. But personal responsibility emphasizes that even if it's somebody else's fault,

224
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,760
even if it's not right or fair, you've got to fix your own life as best you can.

225
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,160
This article mentions that the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario is increasingly

226
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,480
relying on a resource titled, Social Justice Begins With Me. Let's take a look at some of

227
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,480
the sample pages of this curriculum. Here's one based around the children's book, A Shelter in

228
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,400
Our Car. The book's about a homeless Jamaican family that live out of a car. I'm actually not

229
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,200
opposed to children's books like this. Children's books from my childhood and earlier routinely

230
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,760
evoked sadness or anger, but they were tailored towards kids. I don't know if A Shelter in Our

231
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,680
Car is tailored towards kids or not, but check out the lesson plan. Investigate the roles that

232
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,920
racism and gender discrimination play in unemployment and in salary inequity. How much

233
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,800
money do women make in comparison to men? What is the situation for racialized women? I guess grade

234
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,360
five is young enough for wage gap indoctrination according to this program. I would presume that

235
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,600
the characters in this book make less money than the norm not because they're black, Jamaican or

236
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,440
women, but because they live in a fucking car. But saying that in class might get you sent to

237
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,320
the principal's office. Also, what pleb wrote this? You don't need the feature-related bit in

238
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,200
the YouTube URL. Were you just clicking around YouTube finding related SJW links and dumping

239
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,600
them into the program as fast as you could? I've been talking primarily about Ontario schools,

240
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,640
but this is happening coast to coast in Canada. For example, Social Justice 12 is currently

241
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,960
offered in British Columbia high schools. This is an exciting elective course that is currently

242
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,200
being offered in some school districts in BC. It was approved by the Ministry of Education in

243
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,000
August 2008. What is social justice? Social justice is the assurance that the basic human

244
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,800
rights of all people are upheld. Examine social justice issues such as racism, homophobia,

245
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,960
sexism, poverty, and globalization. This course will offer you the opportunity to look at the

246
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,200
causes and consequences of oppression and injustice both in Canada and globally.

247
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,440
Challenge yourself to become an educated, fair, and open-minded global citizen. There's a lot

248
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,720
wrong here, but getting into it would just be retreading old ground at this point. I'll just

249
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,280
point this one thing out. This curriculum considers globalization a social justice issue

250
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,920
on the level of racism and sexism, but also invites the reader to be a global citizen.

251
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,800
Recognize the problem in the classroom, but take your place as a worker drone afterward, you husk.

252
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,440
Challenge yourself to become an ethical, socially responsible global citizen. This is a case study

253
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,040
and research-based course. There is no final exam, but a final action project will be required of all

254
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,080
students. Oh, excellent. No final exam. Just go do a protest or something. Man, I would have had a

255
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,160
fuckload of fun with this back in high school, let me tell you. Even back then I was a bit of

256
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,000
a shitlord. In Abbotsford back in 2008, the school board decided to ban the social justice 12 class.

257
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,800
At least that's what the social justice 12 page says. Watch this video to gain an understanding

258
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,400
on the social justice 12 conference in Abbotsford. Alright, let's take a look.

259
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:31,440
Whoa, that's a woke take, isn't it? Yes, valuing equality in your school system will make people

260
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:39,520
want to be treated equally, and you can't have that, can you? I bet this guy turned out to be

261
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:52,960
a cutie Asian trap due to all this shit. Oh, it's actually a girl. My bad, ma'am. Sir. Sure.

262
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,280
So what was the Abbotsford school board's reasoning for banning social justice 12?

263
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,480
Well, this article from September 19th, 2008, from the Vancouver Sun, states that Abbotsford

264
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,040
school district has ordered its schools not to offer a controversial new elective course

265
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,680
called social justice 12 until it has a chance to review the content. So it was never banned,

266
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,840
they just wanted a chance to examine the course for themselves. That would make sense,

267
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,000
since social justice 12 was only devised one month earlier in August 2008. On October 9th,

268
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,840
2008, the Abbotsford school board began discussions over social justice 12,

269
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,560
and by February 10th, 2009, they had decided to allow it in their schools the following fall.

270
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,040
The school board's desire to examine for themselves the content of a newly created

271
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,160
optional curriculum and not simply blindly going forward with it generated protests like these.

272
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,600
Your ideological pet projects are not and should not be immune to a process of review,

273
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,440
you fucking zombies. And of course, I also have a copy of social justice 12,

274
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,280
let's take a peek inside. This stuff is vague enough that I can really see some young

275
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,600
MRA or something co-opting the whole thing for shits and giggles. But this bit at the bottom,

276
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,880
opportunities for lifelong participation in social justice? I guess this class expects to just churn

277
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,920
out obedient little SJWs who will go on to obey the diversity centres of their universities and

278
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,640
the diversity officers of their workplaces. Here's a task a class may be given to discuss and present

279
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,120
an answer about. Formulate a response to ethical questions related to social justice. Example,

280
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,440
are morals and values absolute? Do the ends justify the means? Should there be limitations

281
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,680
on freedom of expression? What rights should humans have over animals? Is there such a thing

282
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,240
as a just war? What responsibility do individuals have to consider the common good? How does one

283
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,880
reconcile a conflict of values or rights? This is stuff that you'd expect from a philosophy class,

284
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,080
but that's the point. Social justice sees itself as the natural replacement to philosophy. A

285
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,120
philosophy degree might qualify you for a job at Starbucks, but philosophy itself is important.

286
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,320
It's why science or engineering degrees generally require one credit in applied ethics of philosophy,

287
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,080
not necessarily for broad-based learning, but because it's important to understand

288
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,480
why you're doing something almost as much as how you're doing it. Philosophy gives us our moral

289
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,200
guidance, our ethical underpinning, and social justice wants to co-op that spot in our society

290
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,120
in order to push its own agenda. Don't believe me? Check out this question in the next section.

291
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,440
Identify the types of decisions made by government that promote the common good. Example,

292
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,840
non-smoking legislation, legislation against drunk driving, gun control legislation, freedom of

293
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,240
information, worker protection. You can't simply assume that these pieces of legislation promote

294
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,480
the common good. There's certainly well-reasoned arguments for them being in the common good,

295
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,880
but there's also well-reasoned arguments for them being against the common good. But while that

296
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,840
debate might have been allowed in philosophy or ethics, it's not in social justice 12. There's

297
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,720
more examples than ever of this bullshit right now. The making space program, seeing the rainbow,

298
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,600
and so on. Canadian public schools are SJW-ifying everything, and we're already beginning to see

299
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,160
the negative effects. A Greek Orthodox Christian has been battling his school board in court for

300
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,760
seven years, not to try and stop LGBT content from being taught at the school his kids attend,

301
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,080
and not even to have the authority to pull his kids from those classes on a pick-and-choose basis,

302
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,240
despite some misleading headlines in the matter, but to simply be informed by the school when LGBT

303
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,040
content was specifically going to be covered before the day of class. And the school refused.

304
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,160
And he lost his court case, with the judge ruling that simply declaring his parental authority in

305
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,960
the matter would oversimplify common law principles that were not in dispute. The judge

306
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,200
also quipped that he can simply pull his kids from public schooling entirely if he has a problem with

307
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,440
it. Well that's a really shitty fucking answer, but more importantly, I would not be surprised if

308
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,000
that stops being an option for parents in the near future. There's also a financial cost as well.

309
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,880
Schools in Canada are going broke. With some teachers resorting to crowdfunding classes,

310
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,200
Curtis Wiebe has only been teaching for four years, but he's already an old hand when it

311
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,760
comes to using technology to engage his grade six and grade seven students. But the way he and

312
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,200
others like him are funding the necessary classroom equipment is making some people

313
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,240
extremely uneasy. Wiebe is making his classroom a learning lab thanks to a set of small programmable

314
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,800
robots he recently received from a four-year-old Toronto-based charity called My Class Needs.

315
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:03,680
Next on his wish list, virtual reality headsets to make learning literally out of this world for

316
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,760
students to realize his dream of helping his pupils experience what Mars is like. The charity

317
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,400
says it has improved the learning environment for more than 88,000 kids in public schools in Canada,

318
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,720
but critics say it's also furthering inequality in the public school system and opening the door

319
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,120
to letting private money replace government dollars. It sounds to me like private money

320
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,520
is augmenting government dollars, not replacing them. It also sounds to me like these cries of

321
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,000
furthering inequality are just jealousy. Wiebe's found a way to get extra resources for his

322
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,200
classes. He's not taking anything away from other classes in order to do this. He's not driving down

323
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,680
the quality of anybody else's education. When somebody cries inequality because somebody else

324
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,320
is improving themselves or their station, it just sounds petty. But most importantly of all,

325
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,840
why are Canadian public schools having to resort to crowdfunding in the first place?

326
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,280
Surely there's enough money to go around. Maybe there's a few useless programs out there we can

327
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,800
afford to cut. I can't really think of any, though.
