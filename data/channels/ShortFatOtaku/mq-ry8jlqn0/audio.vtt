00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
From The Dolphin Tuna, please do a video on the education system.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.520
Things have gotten really bad in Ontario, even over the past couple of years.

00:07.520 --> 00:11.760
My younger siblings spend their English classes learning about marks and privilege,

00:11.760 --> 00:14.400
rather than, you know, actually reading books.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.880
While my time in high school wasn't too bad,

00:16.880 --> 00:19.920
I'm hearing some ridiculous stuff that's changed since I graduated.

00:19.920 --> 00:25.280
Like really ridiculous, racist, whack job stuff being taught in class to impressionable teenagers,

00:25.280 --> 00:29.600
up to and including teachers standing up and apologizing to students of color

00:29.600 --> 00:31.200
on behalf of white people.

00:31.200 --> 00:34.080
Utterly ridiculous stuff that has no place in the classroom

00:34.080 --> 00:36.880
if you don't want to produce a generation of prejudiced twats.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.320
Well, say no more, pal.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.120
In the last video, I presented the Maclean's article

00:47.120 --> 00:49.120
Why Are Schools Brainwashing Our Children?

00:49.120 --> 00:51.680
as an example of good writing by the magazine in the past.

00:51.680 --> 00:52.880
Let's take a closer look at it.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.280
To those who don't keep up with education trends,

00:55.280 --> 00:57.600
certain recent events might appear to be unrelated.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.400
In May, a Grade 3 class in Toronto took to the streets

01:00.400 --> 01:03.200
with signs and an oversized paper mache oil pipeline

01:03.200 --> 01:06.080
to protest the laying of an actual pipeline in Western Canada.

01:06.080 --> 01:10.080
Last year, in Toronto, first graders brought home student planners

01:10.080 --> 01:14.560
marked with the international days of zero tolerance on female genital mutilation

01:14.560 --> 01:18.960
and ending violence against sex workers as a means to spark conversation on the issues.

01:18.960 --> 01:23.200
In Laval, Quebec, a six-year-old boy was disqualified from a teddy bear contest

01:23.200 --> 01:28.240
because a plastic Ziploc bag was found in his lunch instead of a reusable container.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.360
In St. Marie de Kent, New Brunswick, in 2009,

01:31.360 --> 01:35.600
Grade 4 students were given 10 minutes to decide which three people from this group

01:35.600 --> 01:38.480
should be saved from an imminent planetary explosion,

01:38.480 --> 01:43.680
a Black African, a Chinese person, an Aboriginal, an Acadian Francophone, and an Anglophone.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.200
Here we go, right out of the gate,

01:45.200 --> 01:49.600
and we're already confronting some of the most SJW corrupted nonsense I've ever seen.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.320
Do you guys really think that a class of Grade 3s

01:52.320 --> 01:54.880
understand the nuances in an oil pipeline debate?

01:54.880 --> 01:58.800
Or that it's appropriate for Grade 1s to be talking about genital mutilation?

01:58.800 --> 02:02.160
These are just a handful of examples of the more peculiar byproducts

02:02.160 --> 02:05.440
of a vision gaining ground amongst many education architects,

02:05.440 --> 02:09.040
an elementary school education rooted in social justice principles.

02:09.040 --> 02:12.640
Interestingly, faculties of education in Canada and much of the Western world

02:12.640 --> 02:16.160
are preparing their student teachers to weave social justice throughout the primary school

02:16.160 --> 02:21.440
curriculum in math and science, language arts and social studies, drama and even gym class,

02:21.440 --> 02:25.680
as well as into a range of cross-curricular activities, events, and projects.

02:25.680 --> 02:30.000
The idea is to encourage kids to become critical analysts of contemporary issues,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.480
empathetic defenders of human rights, and gatekeepers of the beleaguered earth.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.320
Oh yes, that's exactly what we need.

02:36.320 --> 02:40.240
We don't need to be teaching math in math class, or science in science class,

02:40.240 --> 02:42.160
or literature in literature class.

02:42.160 --> 02:45.840
These kids need to be learning about social justice everywhere.

02:46.480 --> 02:50.560
Because how else is anybody going to buy into your blatantly false ideology

02:50.560 --> 02:53.280
unless you indoctrinate them from birth like a religious sect?

02:53.280 --> 02:56.560
When it comes to the question of what's appropriate to broach with young children,

02:56.560 --> 02:57.600
conflicts abound.

02:57.600 --> 03:01.680
Last month, Toronto parents were incensed to learn that the Toronto District School Board

03:01.680 --> 03:06.480
webpage promoting health education included a link to an organization that suggested

03:06.480 --> 03:11.440
kids explore their sexuality by experimenting with sex toys and vegetables.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.600
Jesus Christ, just conflicts abound.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.800
Nothing really to worry about here.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.920
It's just two groups having a minor disagreement over a policy.

03:17.920 --> 03:22.080
It's not the school board, an arm of the Ministry of Education, the Canadian government,

03:22.080 --> 03:25.520
telling kids to buy sex toys and masturbate with vegetables.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.200
Obviously I've got nothing against sex toys, but kids are going to discover

03:29.200 --> 03:31.120
masturbation on their own anyway.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.680
They don't need government guidance on the topic.

03:33.680 --> 03:37.280
I mean honestly, did the lunatic over at the Toronto School Board who decided to put this

03:37.280 --> 03:41.120
up have a problem figuring out how to jack off as a kid without the school getting involved?

03:41.120 --> 03:43.280
Like the article said, the Toronto District School Board,

03:43.280 --> 03:45.520
since taken down its sex advice for kids section.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.760
But as you know, the internet never forgets.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.000
The website's not on the internet wayback machine, but due to the hundreds of articles

03:52.000 --> 03:55.200
published about this story, it wasn't hard to dig up some screencaps.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.480
This is about the best image of the page in question that I could find.

03:58.480 --> 04:02.160
I don't know why the original creator of this image put the red arrow where he did,

04:02.160 --> 04:04.720
because the link in question is this one down here.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.960
The Coalition for Positive Sexuality.

04:06.960 --> 04:11.840
And because their website, positive.org, is still up, I've been able to find the page

04:11.840 --> 04:13.840
that the Toronto District School Board linked to.

04:13.840 --> 04:18.160
Let's uh, let's just see what exactly they've been recommending to kids for ourselves.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.760
Most of us learn that sex means a man on top of a woman,

04:21.760 --> 04:23.760
and that the only other choice is abstinence.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.120
But sex can be lots of things.

04:25.120 --> 04:28.000
Women have sex with women, men have sex with men,

04:28.000 --> 04:31.200
women have sex with men, and sometimes the best sex is with yourself.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.800
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.

04:32.800 --> 04:37.200
There are lots of safe and fun ways to get off, which you probably won't learn in school.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.040
Well, that's certainly not true anymore, isn't it?

04:39.040 --> 04:46.080
You could suck, kiss, touch, bite, fondle, nibble, squeeze, and lick someone's body,

04:46.080 --> 04:52.160
nipples, calves, toes, neck, ass, dick, or vulva, jerk yourself off or each other off,

04:52.160 --> 04:56.560
dry or using lots of lubricant, kiss for a long time using lots of tongue,

04:56.560 --> 05:01.440
have sex in front of mirrors, or watch each other jerk off, get into roleplay,

05:01.440 --> 05:05.760
for instance tie someone up and pleasure them, look at sexy pictures and videos,

05:05.760 --> 05:10.560
make up or act out fantasies, talk dirty, dress up, strip down, or cross-dress,

05:10.560 --> 05:13.520
dressing in the clothes of the other gender, just remember that traps are gay,

05:13.520 --> 05:18.960
call your friend and tell him or her your hottest fantasies, if you want to lose a friend, sure,

05:18.960 --> 05:24.640
use cock rings, nipple clamps, or clothespins, or vibrators on your own or someone else's body,

05:24.640 --> 05:29.200
I guess this is the kraut and tea section, shower together or grind against each other with your

05:29.200 --> 05:36.080
clothes on, dry humping, come on someone's belly, back, feet, chest, instead of in them,

05:36.080 --> 05:41.200
play with your own or someone else's ass or vagina, put your fingers, dildos,

05:41.200 --> 05:46.160
vegetables, or butt plugs into them, yes, let's tell kids to put cucumbers in their ass,

05:46.160 --> 05:48.800
this will turn out well, if you're putting something into a butthole,

05:49.600 --> 05:52.880
make sure it has a flared base and looks something like the picture,

05:52.880 --> 05:57.200
that way it can't go all the way in and get stuck, why thank you, thank you for that picture,

05:57.200 --> 06:00.640
I'm sure a 6 year old is going to look at that, remember his old soother,

06:00.640 --> 06:04.880
and go try something stupid, fucking incredible, let's get back to the mclean's article,

06:04.880 --> 06:08.720
between the mounting examples of how social justice education can go wrong,

06:08.720 --> 06:11.920
and the passionate defenses from those responsible for training teachers,

06:11.920 --> 06:14.640
the fight is growing over what's going on in primary classrooms,

06:14.640 --> 06:18.080
it's proponents argue that today's students are especially in need of it,

06:18.080 --> 06:22.000
a growing mandate to integrate special education students into mainstream classrooms,

06:22.000 --> 06:25.760
requires better understanding from children, a new awareness of the effects of bullying,

06:25.760 --> 06:29.280
puts the onus on teachers to inculcate empathy in students,

06:29.280 --> 06:32.960
and increased diversity in the classroom can fuel intolerance from all sides,

06:32.960 --> 06:37.280
so from what I can gather, the argument here is that some people want social justice in grade

06:37.280 --> 06:41.760
school in Canada, because simply teaching math and literature and science isn't enough to provide

06:41.760 --> 06:46.720
a cultural bulwark against nazi style authoritarianism, they actually use that example

06:46.720 --> 06:51.200
in the article, and a morals based education would provide for racial diversity, it would

06:51.200 --> 06:54.640
help stop bullying, and it would create a more empathetic generation of people,

06:54.640 --> 06:58.000
the counter argument, which is also given its fair shake in the article,

06:58.000 --> 07:03.040
is that math class is for math, not morality, there are plenty of other classes like drama,

07:03.040 --> 07:06.480
arts, or literature, that can provide a philosophical or moral background,

07:06.480 --> 07:08.960
which I personally believe is an important part of education,

07:08.960 --> 07:11.200
but there's no place for it in the hard sciences,

07:11.200 --> 07:14.560
I obviously find the second position more appealing than the first, and here's why,

07:14.560 --> 07:18.880
when the proponents of social justice education say that their education is morals based,

07:18.880 --> 07:22.240
I just don't believe them, I don't believe them because they show grade fours,

07:22.240 --> 07:25.520
pictures of dead gorillas in the Congo, as a part of the curriculum of human's

07:25.520 --> 07:29.760
effects on the environment, I don't believe them because a grade five math lesson involved

07:29.760 --> 07:33.600
calculating the amount the Canadian government spent on the war in Afghanistan, the amount it

07:33.600 --> 07:39.520
spends on poverty, and the lesson, a math lesson, culminated in a letter writing campaign to elected

07:39.520 --> 07:43.520
MPs, I'm not saying these topics can't be talked about at all, there's legitimate discussion to

07:43.520 --> 07:48.240
be had here, but not with kids, not when they're in a school system that prioritizes performance

07:48.240 --> 07:52.240
and regurgitation over actual learning and critical thinking, they're meant to be learning

07:52.240 --> 07:57.120
the skills and tools to tackle the tough problems later in life, not indoctrinated into tackling

07:57.120 --> 08:01.200
them right now in exactly the way the teacher, the school board, or the government wants them to,

08:01.200 --> 08:05.600
I'll discuss this more in detail in the next part, but I think it's pertinent to point out here,

08:05.600 --> 08:09.760
that Canadian grade schools are forcing controversial topics of discussion onto

08:09.760 --> 08:14.880
children when it's inappropriate to do so, while Canadian universities are censoring controversial

08:14.880 --> 08:19.520
topics of discussion when it's legal adults in the room, not kids, and as we've seen with the

08:19.520 --> 08:23.680
Lindsay Shepherd situation, they're doing it with the justification that the students are just too

08:23.680 --> 08:28.000
young to be able to handle it, so what the hell is driving all of this? Margaret Wente over at

08:28.000 --> 08:32.400
the Globe and Mail has a hypothesis to offer up in her article, Your New School Curriculum,

08:32.400 --> 08:38.320
Social Justice for All, equality is no longer the goal, the new goal is equity, a very different

08:38.320 --> 08:42.560
concept, according to a sweeping draft plan prepared for the Toronto District School Board,

08:42.560 --> 08:47.440
equity is not achieved by treating students fairly, it is achieved by challenging entrenched

08:47.440 --> 08:51.760
systems of power and privilege, and constantly working to center the conversation around the

08:51.760 --> 08:57.280
effects of inequity, oppression, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia,

08:57.280 --> 09:01.280
and other forms of hate and discrimination specifically for racialized students.

09:01.280 --> 09:05.600
In other words, kids' success or failure is shaped by historic forces that determine

09:05.600 --> 09:11.120
their victim status. The vexed question of why some racialized students do extremely well,

09:11.120 --> 09:15.360
and others not so well, is not addressed. Equality means treating everyone equally,

09:15.360 --> 09:20.240
removing all institutional barriers to success, and letting people succeed or fail based on their

09:20.240 --> 09:24.400
merits and their hard work. Equity, at least the way the Toronto District School Board has

09:24.400 --> 09:28.560
defined it, is about making sure everybody's results are the same, nobody does too poorly

09:28.560 --> 09:32.480
compared to the norm, nobody does too well compared to the norm, everybody's just the same.

09:32.480 --> 09:37.200
It's a reframing of the equality of opportunity versus equality of outcome debate. If you believe

09:37.200 --> 09:41.520
in the idea that individual people are different from one another, and by the way, this idea is

09:41.520 --> 09:46.320
known as the truth, then somewhere down the line those differences will lead to different outcomes

09:46.320 --> 09:51.040
in what those individuals choose to do with their lives, both in terms of what they devote themselves

09:51.040 --> 09:55.920
to, and how good they are at doing it. If there's no institutional barriers put in the way of this

09:55.920 --> 10:00.640
process, that's equality of opportunity. That's freedom. And there's always going to be at least

10:00.640 --> 10:05.120
a little bit of inherent inequality in a free society, because freedom means people are free

10:05.120 --> 10:09.920
to make the wrong choices in life, or even the right choices that are simply less optimized in

10:09.920 --> 10:14.160
practice. Meanwhile, the proponents of equality of outcome state that in a system where there's

10:14.160 --> 10:19.280
no institutional barriers in place, all outcomes will naturally be the same. This is because they

10:19.280 --> 10:23.840
believe there's no fundamental differences between individuals, so that all human beings should be

10:23.840 --> 10:28.400
able to do roughly the same thing. And if they don't, it's because institutional barriers still

10:28.400 --> 10:33.040
exist, hidden somewhere, and it's the job of society to remove them. Remember back in my video

10:33.040 --> 10:37.920
Why Capitalism is a Success, I made a remark to the effect that socialists and communists

10:37.920 --> 10:41.840
don't take into account human passion when ordering the production of their societies.

10:41.840 --> 10:47.040
Equality of outcome is the practical reality of that theory. And when played out in the real world,

10:47.040 --> 10:51.440
it amounts to the flattening of people's lives. Margaret Wente describes this in relation to

10:51.440 --> 10:56.080
Canada's public schools. One mother wrote me that social justice and equity are now the focus of her

10:56.080 --> 11:00.720
son's school. At parent council meetings, they talk about microaggressions. There is no room,

11:00.720 --> 11:05.520
it seems, for white children or mixed children, she lamented. Her children are mixed.

11:05.520 --> 11:10.720
In the name of social justice, grade nine math is being de-streamed. De-streaming is a big deal

11:10.720 --> 11:15.600
these days. Streaming is unjust, we're told, because kids in the applied stream are less

11:15.600 --> 11:19.840
successful at math than kids in the academic stream. This is attributed not to their lower

11:19.840 --> 11:24.720
math skills, but to structural elements that divide students. Putting the applied kids in

11:24.720 --> 11:29.600
the academic stream will raise their aspirations, their self-esteem, and therefore their results.

11:29.600 --> 11:34.560
As Ontario's new equity plan says confidently, given the opportunity and the right supports,

11:34.560 --> 11:38.000
all students can succeed in the academic stream. For those of you who don't know,

11:38.000 --> 11:42.160
classes are divided into two levels in high school over here, applied and academic. This

11:42.160 --> 11:45.920
doesn't include special education or gifted education. Applied and academic are the two

11:45.920 --> 11:50.000
categories for the general population. Applied classes are meant to teach practical knowledge

11:50.000 --> 11:54.240
that can be used in a trade school or a blue collar job, while academic classes teach the

11:54.240 --> 11:59.120
same content and the same topics, but tailored for a university, business, or research setting.

11:59.120 --> 12:03.280
At least, that's how it was when I was in high school. Now the classes are being de-streamed,

12:03.280 --> 12:07.200
and everybody's being forced into one class regardless of their skills, their intelligence,

12:07.200 --> 12:11.360
their prior education, or their goals after they've left the school. And it's being done

12:11.360 --> 12:15.600
not because of budget cuts, it's being done because of social justice. Because if the

12:15.600 --> 12:20.480
academic classes are privileged, then equality of outcome demands that everybody be in them,

12:20.480 --> 12:24.000
and if some students underperform, it's blamed on institutional barriers.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.880
The results of this new program are exactly as you'd expect.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.480
Here's what will happen with de-streaming, wrote Don Cooper, a retired teacher,

12:30.480 --> 12:31.920
in a letter to the Toronto Star.

12:31.920 --> 12:36.160
Grade 9 teachers will be faced with a classroom with more academic and social disparity,

12:36.160 --> 12:40.880
which will be much more difficult to educate. Translation, struggling kids will be the losers.

12:40.880 --> 12:45.040
All of those underprivileged kids that this social justice nonsense is supposed to help,

12:45.040 --> 12:48.480
they're the ones who are going to suffer the ill effects of it. A huge predictor of problems

12:48.480 --> 12:53.360
at school, more than race, gender, sexuality, or whatever, is the stability of the family home,

12:53.360 --> 12:57.760
and no amount of anti-bias training on the part of the teachers or social justice-infused

12:57.760 --> 13:01.200
curriculums in the classroom are going to help with that. And you know what? People

13:01.200 --> 13:05.120
wanting to escape this nonsense are probably just going to be shit out of luck. Ontario

13:05.120 --> 13:09.360
parents uncomfortable with social justice education may have nowhere else to go. Well,

13:09.360 --> 13:14.400
of course not. What use would a massive propaganda vehicle be if people could simply opt out of it?

13:14.400 --> 13:18.080
Few parents would object to schools trying to teach children about the importance of respecting

13:18.080 --> 13:21.680
others and the harms caused by discrimination. But there's no consensus on the definition of

13:21.680 --> 13:25.120
some of the problems the social justice curriculum aims to identify and stamp out,

13:25.120 --> 13:28.880
so teaching could easily cross the line from education to political indoctrination.

13:28.880 --> 13:33.120
It's easy to imagine how teaching on these issues could go off the rails at an elementary school

13:33.120 --> 13:37.120
if teachers view the inculcation of a particular worldview as part of their job. Moreover,

13:37.120 --> 13:42.240
the rise of social justice education may squeeze out other proven approaches to character education

13:42.240 --> 13:46.880
focused primarily on developing student resilience and accountability. That's actually a good point.

13:46.880 --> 13:51.680
Social justice and taking responsibility for your life are two incompatible points of view.

13:51.680 --> 13:55.520
Social justice teaches that if you're a victim, it's not your fault. It's your parents, or it's

13:55.520 --> 13:59.760
societies, or it's the schools, or it's the patriarchy. If you're not reaching your potential,

13:59.760 --> 14:04.560
some kind of power structure exists that's keeping you down. However, when you take responsibility

14:04.560 --> 14:08.640
for your life, the social justice theory has to go out the window. Taking responsibility doesn't

14:08.640 --> 14:12.320
mean that you're not a victim. It doesn't mean that where you came from isn't real or that what

14:12.320 --> 14:16.640
happened to you is your fault. It simply means that you say, regardless of what happened in my

14:16.640 --> 14:22.560
past, what's been done to me unjustly, I'm going to do the best I can right now to own my actions,

14:22.560 --> 14:26.560
my reactions, my thoughts and feelings, and I'm going to do the best I can with what I have.

14:26.560 --> 14:31.200
Social justice emphasizes that because you were wronged, somebody else needs to take action to

14:31.200 --> 14:35.760
fix you. But personal responsibility emphasizes that even if it's somebody else's fault,

14:35.760 --> 14:39.760
even if it's not right or fair, you've got to fix your own life as best you can.

14:39.760 --> 14:44.160
This article mentions that the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario is increasingly

14:44.160 --> 14:48.480
relying on a resource titled, Social Justice Begins With Me. Let's take a look at some of

14:48.480 --> 14:52.480
the sample pages of this curriculum. Here's one based around the children's book, A Shelter in

14:52.480 --> 14:56.400
Our Car. The book's about a homeless Jamaican family that live out of a car. I'm actually not

14:56.400 --> 15:01.200
opposed to children's books like this. Children's books from my childhood and earlier routinely

15:01.200 --> 15:05.760
evoked sadness or anger, but they were tailored towards kids. I don't know if A Shelter in Our

15:05.760 --> 15:09.680
Car is tailored towards kids or not, but check out the lesson plan. Investigate the roles that

15:09.680 --> 15:13.920
racism and gender discrimination play in unemployment and in salary inequity. How much

15:13.920 --> 15:18.800
money do women make in comparison to men? What is the situation for racialized women? I guess grade

15:18.800 --> 15:23.360
five is young enough for wage gap indoctrination according to this program. I would presume that

15:23.360 --> 15:27.600
the characters in this book make less money than the norm not because they're black, Jamaican or

15:27.600 --> 15:31.440
women, but because they live in a fucking car. But saying that in class might get you sent to

15:31.440 --> 15:36.320
the principal's office. Also, what pleb wrote this? You don't need the feature-related bit in

15:36.320 --> 15:41.200
the YouTube URL. Were you just clicking around YouTube finding related SJW links and dumping

15:41.200 --> 15:45.600
them into the program as fast as you could? I've been talking primarily about Ontario schools,

15:45.600 --> 15:50.640
but this is happening coast to coast in Canada. For example, Social Justice 12 is currently

15:50.640 --> 15:54.960
offered in British Columbia high schools. This is an exciting elective course that is currently

15:54.960 --> 15:59.200
being offered in some school districts in BC. It was approved by the Ministry of Education in

15:59.200 --> 16:04.000
August 2008. What is social justice? Social justice is the assurance that the basic human

16:04.000 --> 16:08.800
rights of all people are upheld. Examine social justice issues such as racism, homophobia,

16:08.800 --> 16:12.960
sexism, poverty, and globalization. This course will offer you the opportunity to look at the

16:12.960 --> 16:17.200
causes and consequences of oppression and injustice both in Canada and globally.

16:17.200 --> 16:21.440
Challenge yourself to become an educated, fair, and open-minded global citizen. There's a lot

16:21.440 --> 16:24.720
wrong here, but getting into it would just be retreading old ground at this point. I'll just

16:24.720 --> 16:29.280
point this one thing out. This curriculum considers globalization a social justice issue

16:29.280 --> 16:33.920
on the level of racism and sexism, but also invites the reader to be a global citizen.

16:33.920 --> 16:38.800
Recognize the problem in the classroom, but take your place as a worker drone afterward, you husk.

16:38.800 --> 16:43.440
Challenge yourself to become an ethical, socially responsible global citizen. This is a case study

16:43.440 --> 16:49.040
and research-based course. There is no final exam, but a final action project will be required of all

16:49.040 --> 16:54.080
students. Oh, excellent. No final exam. Just go do a protest or something. Man, I would have had a

16:54.080 --> 16:58.160
fuckload of fun with this back in high school, let me tell you. Even back then I was a bit of

16:58.160 --> 17:04.000
a shitlord. In Abbotsford back in 2008, the school board decided to ban the social justice 12 class.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.800
At least that's what the social justice 12 page says. Watch this video to gain an understanding

17:08.800 --> 17:12.400
on the social justice 12 conference in Abbotsford. Alright, let's take a look.

17:24.080 --> 17:31.440
Whoa, that's a woke take, isn't it? Yes, valuing equality in your school system will make people

17:31.440 --> 17:39.520
want to be treated equally, and you can't have that, can you? I bet this guy turned out to be

17:39.520 --> 17:52.960
a cutie Asian trap due to all this shit. Oh, it's actually a girl. My bad, ma'am. Sir. Sure.

17:52.960 --> 17:57.280
So what was the Abbotsford school board's reasoning for banning social justice 12?

17:57.280 --> 18:02.480
Well, this article from September 19th, 2008, from the Vancouver Sun, states that Abbotsford

18:02.480 --> 18:07.040
school district has ordered its schools not to offer a controversial new elective course

18:07.040 --> 18:11.680
called social justice 12 until it has a chance to review the content. So it was never banned,

18:11.680 --> 18:15.840
they just wanted a chance to examine the course for themselves. That would make sense,

18:15.840 --> 18:22.000
since social justice 12 was only devised one month earlier in August 2008. On October 9th,

18:22.000 --> 18:25.840
2008, the Abbotsford school board began discussions over social justice 12,

18:25.840 --> 18:30.560
and by February 10th, 2009, they had decided to allow it in their schools the following fall.

18:30.560 --> 18:35.040
The school board's desire to examine for themselves the content of a newly created

18:35.040 --> 18:40.160
optional curriculum and not simply blindly going forward with it generated protests like these.

18:40.160 --> 18:45.600
Your ideological pet projects are not and should not be immune to a process of review,

18:45.600 --> 18:49.440
you fucking zombies. And of course, I also have a copy of social justice 12,

18:49.440 --> 18:53.280
let's take a peek inside. This stuff is vague enough that I can really see some young

18:53.280 --> 18:57.600
MRA or something co-opting the whole thing for shits and giggles. But this bit at the bottom,

18:57.600 --> 19:02.880
opportunities for lifelong participation in social justice? I guess this class expects to just churn

19:02.880 --> 19:07.920
out obedient little SJWs who will go on to obey the diversity centres of their universities and

19:07.920 --> 19:12.640
the diversity officers of their workplaces. Here's a task a class may be given to discuss and present

19:12.640 --> 19:17.120
an answer about. Formulate a response to ethical questions related to social justice. Example,

19:17.120 --> 19:21.440
are morals and values absolute? Do the ends justify the means? Should there be limitations

19:21.440 --> 19:25.680
on freedom of expression? What rights should humans have over animals? Is there such a thing

19:25.680 --> 19:30.240
as a just war? What responsibility do individuals have to consider the common good? How does one

19:30.240 --> 19:34.880
reconcile a conflict of values or rights? This is stuff that you'd expect from a philosophy class,

19:34.880 --> 19:40.080
but that's the point. Social justice sees itself as the natural replacement to philosophy. A

19:40.080 --> 19:45.120
philosophy degree might qualify you for a job at Starbucks, but philosophy itself is important.

19:45.120 --> 19:50.320
It's why science or engineering degrees generally require one credit in applied ethics of philosophy,

19:50.320 --> 19:54.080
not necessarily for broad-based learning, but because it's important to understand

19:54.080 --> 19:58.480
why you're doing something almost as much as how you're doing it. Philosophy gives us our moral

19:58.480 --> 20:03.200
guidance, our ethical underpinning, and social justice wants to co-op that spot in our society

20:03.200 --> 20:07.120
in order to push its own agenda. Don't believe me? Check out this question in the next section.

20:07.120 --> 20:11.440
Identify the types of decisions made by government that promote the common good. Example,

20:11.440 --> 20:15.840
non-smoking legislation, legislation against drunk driving, gun control legislation, freedom of

20:15.840 --> 20:20.240
information, worker protection. You can't simply assume that these pieces of legislation promote

20:20.240 --> 20:24.480
the common good. There's certainly well-reasoned arguments for them being in the common good,

20:24.480 --> 20:28.880
but there's also well-reasoned arguments for them being against the common good. But while that

20:28.880 --> 20:33.840
debate might have been allowed in philosophy or ethics, it's not in social justice 12. There's

20:33.840 --> 20:38.720
more examples than ever of this bullshit right now. The making space program, seeing the rainbow,

20:38.720 --> 20:43.600
and so on. Canadian public schools are SJW-ifying everything, and we're already beginning to see

20:43.600 --> 20:48.160
the negative effects. A Greek Orthodox Christian has been battling his school board in court for

20:48.160 --> 20:53.760
seven years, not to try and stop LGBT content from being taught at the school his kids attend,

20:53.760 --> 20:58.080
and not even to have the authority to pull his kids from those classes on a pick-and-choose basis,

20:58.080 --> 21:04.240
despite some misleading headlines in the matter, but to simply be informed by the school when LGBT

21:04.240 --> 21:09.040
content was specifically going to be covered before the day of class. And the school refused.

21:09.040 --> 21:14.160
And he lost his court case, with the judge ruling that simply declaring his parental authority in

21:14.160 --> 21:18.960
the matter would oversimplify common law principles that were not in dispute. The judge

21:18.960 --> 21:23.200
also quipped that he can simply pull his kids from public schooling entirely if he has a problem with

21:23.200 --> 21:27.440
it. Well that's a really shitty fucking answer, but more importantly, I would not be surprised if

21:27.440 --> 21:32.000
that stops being an option for parents in the near future. There's also a financial cost as well.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.880
Schools in Canada are going broke. With some teachers resorting to crowdfunding classes,

21:36.880 --> 21:41.200
Curtis Wiebe has only been teaching for four years, but he's already an old hand when it

21:41.200 --> 21:45.760
comes to using technology to engage his grade six and grade seven students. But the way he and

21:45.760 --> 21:49.200
others like him are funding the necessary classroom equipment is making some people

21:49.200 --> 21:54.240
extremely uneasy. Wiebe is making his classroom a learning lab thanks to a set of small programmable

21:54.240 --> 21:58.800
robots he recently received from a four-year-old Toronto-based charity called My Class Needs.

21:58.800 --> 22:03.680
Next on his wish list, virtual reality headsets to make learning literally out of this world for

22:03.680 --> 22:07.760
students to realize his dream of helping his pupils experience what Mars is like. The charity

22:07.760 --> 22:12.400
says it has improved the learning environment for more than 88,000 kids in public schools in Canada,

22:12.400 --> 22:16.720
but critics say it's also furthering inequality in the public school system and opening the door

22:16.720 --> 22:21.120
to letting private money replace government dollars. It sounds to me like private money

22:21.120 --> 22:25.520
is augmenting government dollars, not replacing them. It also sounds to me like these cries of

22:25.520 --> 22:30.000
furthering inequality are just jealousy. Wiebe's found a way to get extra resources for his

22:30.000 --> 22:35.200
classes. He's not taking anything away from other classes in order to do this. He's not driving down

22:35.200 --> 22:39.680
the quality of anybody else's education. When somebody cries inequality because somebody else

22:39.680 --> 22:44.320
is improving themselves or their station, it just sounds petty. But most importantly of all,

22:44.320 --> 22:47.840
why are Canadian public schools having to resort to crowdfunding in the first place?

22:47.840 --> 22:51.280
Surely there's enough money to go around. Maybe there's a few useless programs out there we can

22:51.280 --> 22:54.800
afford to cut. I can't really think of any, though.
