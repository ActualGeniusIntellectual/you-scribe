0	9000	I've spoken at length about Black Lives Matter on this channel before.
9000	14140	In August of 2020, I made a video called Where Does the BLM Money Go, tracing the financials
14140	17500	of the various donations from the website, BlackLivesMatter.org.
17500	21520	Most of those donations went to ActBlue, a Democrat slush fund, though some of them obviously
21520	25420	found their way into the hands of the people who run the various Black Lives Matter groups.
25420	29980	We know this because I put out another video in April of 2021 called Living Your Principles,
29980	33900	where we talked about the fact that the BLM organization leader Patrisse Khan-Cullors
33900	35260	is a trained Marxist.
35260	39220	A video clip of her talking about Marxism went viral that everyone on the internet has
39220	40220	been using in their videos.
40220	62740	Yeah, that one.
62740	63740	Don't worry though.
63740	64740	For variety's sake, I found another.
64740	84340	It came out in the spring of last year that Khan-Cullors used the BLM money to buy multiple
84340	87180	homes, including a secluded compound in Topanga Canyon.
87180	91980	I did a few other BLM videos over the years, mainly talking about various individual acts
91980	97100	of violence, both committed by and committed to black people, and how those events related
97100	101340	or didn't relate, contrary to popular opinion, to Black Lives Matter as a movement.
101340	103900	But we're talking about the financial side of things again today.
103900	104900	The reason why?
104900	108640	Well, because I came across this tweet, BLM is missing $60 million.
108640	111300	The headquarters doesn't exist, and the leaders have disappeared.
111300	112300	Where is the money?
112300	116000	Also, as a side note, nice job, Dr. Evil.
116000	118140	First time I've ever seen a double looting.
118140	119140	Oof.
119140	121500	Jokes aside, what the hell is actually going on here?
121540	125020	Well, let's start with this article from the Washington Examiner.
125020	129060	BLM's millions unaccounted for after leaders quietly jump ship.
129060	132260	No one appears to have been in charge of Black Lives Matter for months.
132260	136900	The address it lists on tax forms is wrong, and the charity's two board members won't
136900	139780	say who controls its $60 million bankroll.
139780	144680	BLM's shocking lack of transparency surrounding its finances and operations raises major legal
144680	148660	and ethical red flags, multiple charity experts told the Washington Examiner.
148660	153100	Like a giant ghost ship full of treasure, drifting in the night with no captain, no
153100	157660	discernible crew, and no clear direction, charity watch executive director Laurie Stritten
157660	158860	said of BLM.
158860	164260	BLM co-founder Patrice Kahn-Cullors appointed two activists to serve as the group's senior
164260	168540	directors following her resignation in May amid scrutiny over her personal finances.
168540	170640	That's right, I didn't do a video on this.
170640	175380	This went down after it went viral that Kahn-Cullors was buying so many houses with the BLM money.
175380	179500	So she decided to fade from public view, taking a deal with Warner Brothers to work
179500	184060	on BLM-related productions to the widespread laughter everybody's smart enough to know
184060	185660	it was all a scam early on.
185660	191340	BLM denied allegations that Kahn-Cullors spent BLM funds on her personal properties.
191340	196840	However, BLM and other activist organizations under Kahn-Cullors' control offered contracts
196840	199620	to an art company led by the father of her only child.
199620	202740	I mean, I guess that's one way to launder money.
202740	207720	Have your wealthy charity activist organization spend all of its cash buying your relatives
207720	212300	overpriced African artwork that you can display around various cities calling it representation,
212300	213880	and then peace out with your cut.
213880	219260	The story here is that Damon Turner, head of a group that does music and art-based black
219260	224740	activism called Trap Heels, went on a progressive podcast with like 20 views called What We
224740	228300	Gon' Do, yes that's actually the name of it, where he talks about the professional
228300	232900	connection between his organization and Black Lives Matter through Patrice Kahn-Cullors.
288300	293420	But, later in the podcast, he describes a birthday celebration and how Kahn-Cullors
293420	296460	was a major part of it, sounding more like a romantic partner.
319300	324060	And like that was the thing, then like, you know, Patrice organized like my family and
324060	328860	friends to like send like some videos, like my, you know, head of cinematography, Giovanni
328860	334020	cut this really beautiful 20 minute like video of people just like loving me and all these
334020	335020	things.
335020	339300	And then after that, like she organized a fucking like a birthday, like quarantine birthday
339300	343460	party in the parking lot of her gallery with like all the homies pulled up and like, you
343460	347600	know, it just felt really, just like felt really beautiful man.
347600	351200	And on Kahn-Cullors' Instagram in 2019, she said,
370200	373700	In other words, this guy is out here talking about Kahn-Cullors as if she's a business
373700	378600	associate where there are two organizations, BLM and Trap Heels, are just entering into
378600	384100	normal business deals, but in actuality, he's the father of her kid, they were in a relationship
384100	388800	together and now they are close friends and she's funneling BLM money to her family through
388800	390400	his organization.
390400	394220	Also on her Instagram, I found an interview that she did as the head of a different charity
394220	398500	organization called Dignity and Power Now, a prisoner activist group.
398500	401760	Patrice Kahn-Cullors started that group in 2013.
401760	406760	And public IRS records of the organization, unearthed in June of 2021, showed that they
406760	410960	told the IRS they made less than $50,000 in 2016.
410960	414760	But the public records of two other groups, the Resnick Foundation and the California
414760	421200	Initiative, show that those two organizations donated $225,000 to Dignity and Power Now
421200	422520	in 2016.
422520	425800	Nobody knows where that money went, but I think we can take a guess.
425800	430300	Aside from BLM and Dignity and Power Now, Patrice Kahn-Cullors also founded Justice
430300	435340	LA and the Justice Teams Network, groups that hosted Bernie Sanders in 2018, as well
435340	436660	as Talcum X.
436660	440380	All of these groups seem to be fronts established to shuffle money around.
440380	446560	For example, in 2018, the Justice Teams Network received a $400,000 grant to give to Justice
446560	451480	LA, where it turned out that Justice LA's fund was the same fund as Dignity and Power
451480	452480	Now.
452480	456600	Another group connected to all of this is Reform LA Jails, which received more than
456600	459760	$1.4 million in donations in 2019.
459760	464200	Over half of that money was paid out to just four entities, and remember their names for
464200	465200	later.
465200	470560	$270,000 went to a consulting company owned by Shalomia Bowers, a person who works with
470560	473360	Patrice Kahn-Cullors on Dignity and Power Now.
473360	478240	$211,000 went to Asha Bandele as payment for services rendered for writing Kahn-Cullors'
478240	479240	memoir.
479240	484620	$205,000 to a consulting company called Janaya and Patrice Consulting, which Patrice Kahn-Cullors
484620	486080	likely owns one half of.
486080	491480	And $86,000 went to Trap Heels, that company run by Damon Turner, the father of Kahn-Cullors'
491480	492480	child.
492480	500520	Trap Heels also received $150,000 from BLM directly for running an election night livestream.
500520	504580	So what I see happening here is that Patrice Kahn-Cullors and her colleagues and family
504580	509740	all own these various LLCs and charity organizations and use them to obscure the shuffling around
509740	513320	of money, the vast majority of which comes from people who are donating to Black Lives
513320	515620	Matter thinking they're helping with racial injustice.
515620	521220	There's been the BLM Global Network Foundation, the BLM Global Network, the BLM Action Fund,
521220	527020	BLM Grassroots, the BLM Political Action Committee, the BLM Global Network Project, the BLM Support
527020	530700	Fund, all of which are different organizations that these people have their hands in, as
530700	535140	well as Dignity and Power Now, the Justice Teams Network, and Justice LA, all run by
535140	537420	the same clique, all of them shuffling money around.
537420	541300	In fact, there's even a completely unrelated organization called the Black Lives Matter
541300	546220	Foundation which Google, Apple, and Microsoft all donated $4 million to without looking.
546220	551540	And it turns out it wasn't owned by anybody in this group and in fact was a pro-police
551540	552540	organization.
552540	553540	Whoops.
553540	556100	The point is though, after the money has been laundered, after it's been shuffled through
556100	560020	all of these fronts, it doesn't actually go into helping actual real charities that provide
560020	561020	for the poor.
561020	564180	It instead goes into the pockets of the people running the organizations.
564180	567800	Now that we know a few more of the players, let's keep reading that Washington Examiner
567800	570980	article and see if any familiar names pop up.
570980	575680	Ann Cullors announced in May she was stepping down and that activists Makani Themba and
575680	579640	Monifa Bandele would lead the organization as senior executives.
579640	583500	But Themba and Bandele revealed in September that they never actually took the job because
583500	586300	of disagreements with BLM's Acting Leadership Council.
586300	590940	Monifa Bandele, by the way, is the sister of Asha Bandele, the memoir writer who got
590940	592980	$211,000.
592980	597500	When an investigative reporter from The Intelligencer, who by the way was a black man, asked Bandele
597500	602420	about the spending of Reform LA jails, he was called racist and sexist for daring to
602420	603420	question them.
603420	607840	Both Themba and Bandele told the Washington Examiner they do not know who took over as
607840	612740	BLM's top executive after their departure, and neither would say who served on the council.
612740	617700	The two remaining BLM board members, Shalomia Bowers and Raymond Howard, did not return
617700	622100	numerous requests for comment asking who has been in charge of BLM and its money since
622100	624060	Cullors left the charity in May.
624060	628260	Bowers served as the treasurer for multiple activist organizations run by Khan Cullors,
628260	634340	including a BLM PAC and a Los Angeles-based jail reform group that paid Cullors $20,000
634340	640580	a month and dropped nearly $26,000 for meetings at a luxury Malibu beach resort in 2019.
640580	643220	Bowers declined to comment when reached by phone on Monday.
643220	644780	Oh, there's another name we recognize.
644780	649660	Shalomia Bowers, the person who got $270,000 from Reform LA jails.
649660	654020	Howard has spoken openly on Facebook about his work with BLM and his close relationship
654020	658260	with Khan Cullors, but he appears to have recently taken steps to conceal his role within
658260	659260	the charity.
659260	663940	As recently as last Friday, his page was modified after the Washington Examiner contacted Howard
663940	668020	for comment and now states he serves as the director of operations for a non-profit.
668020	672060	A reference to Howard's position as the finance and operations manager of New Impact
672060	677300	Partners, a Dayton, Ohio-based consulting firm owned by his sister, was also removed
677300	678780	from his LinkedIn profile.
678780	682780	Also as recently as last Friday, a website for New Impact Partners attributed a quote
682780	687180	to Raymond from Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation thanking the consulting
687180	691020	firm for its help solving BLM's organizational challenges.
691020	695020	The attribution was removed from the website after the Washington Examiner asked Howard
695020	697620	how much BLM has paid his sister's firm.
697620	702340	On Tuesday, a Washington Examiner reporter attempted to request BLM's 2020 tax form
702340	707260	990 in person at the charity's office in Los Angeles, which the group disclosed as
707260	712160	the location its books are stored in in previous filings submitted to the IRS, only to be told
712160	716660	by a security guard at that location there has never been a BLM office there.
716660	720820	An unidentified BLM spokesperson informed the Washington Examiner on Thursday that the
720820	725340	group does not currently maintain a permanent office and offered to mail a copy of its 990
725340	726400	within two weeks.
726400	729320	It seems to me that as soon as the public began to realize what was going on, these
729320	732480	people began to bail out of the BLM organization.
732480	737080	Khan Cullors and her huge home purchases went viral and then she quietly slipped away.
737080	741240	Two other people that Cullors put in charge decided not to be the ones left holding the
741240	743460	hot potato and so they declined the offer.
743460	747600	And then the final two, Bowers and Howard, were left holding the BLM bag, which they
747600	751540	promptly emptied and then tried to conceal their involvement from the rest of the world.
751540	755000	By the way, another of those properties that Khan Cullors has bought up?
755000	759600	It's a historic building in Toronto, notably once home to the Canadian Communist Party.
759600	765100	The $6.3 million used to buy the building, which was previously the Wild Seed Centre
765100	769460	for Art and Activism, was transferred from the Black Lives Matter charity to the Canadian
769460	775580	charity M4BJ, which is run by Khan Cullors' wife, Janaya Khan.
775580	779120	And that name, Janaya Khan, that certainly sounds familiar as well.
779120	782600	Perhaps that's the Janaya from Janaya and Patrice Consulting, the organization that
782600	785540	received $205,000 from LA jails.
785540	787020	I think there's a pretty good chance of it.
787020	789860	Vice ran a story on these two in 2017.
789860	793440	It's a fluff piece talking about their relationship with institutional oppression, with obvious
793440	797160	appeals to slavery and their ancestry and all this other garbage, but fuck me, look
797160	798160	at them.
798160	799480	Do these people look poor to you?
799480	802600	Do they look like they're living in a crack den in the ghetto?
802600	806480	Obviously regarding the ethics behind Black Lives Matter, nobody can object.
806480	811040	Black people matter just as much as any other race of people, and if the point is that race-based
811040	814040	injustices may still exist, that's obviously unacceptable.
814040	817620	But at this point, it should be pretty clear what's going on here.
817620	822240	Everyone who donated to BLM, the organization, the charity, the legal entity, got fucking
822240	823240	played.
823240	826040	I'm really sorry for all those poor people out there who might have gotten suckered into
826040	829420	this, thinking that five extra bucks they had left over from their minimum wage job
829420	833600	went to actually helping anybody, but instead it just lined the pockets of these grifters.
833600	839080	There are many stories of Patrice Con Cullors shafting other people through BLM.
839080	844120	Tori Johnson began a group called BLM Huntington Beach after the death of George Floyd.
844120	848680	He wanted to lead a counter-protest in response to a planned White Lives Matter event.
848680	852680	Con Cullors used her platform to denounce Johnson's event and demanded the movement
852680	855840	focus on her own event happening at the same time instead.
855840	860060	That public statement caused widespread support to be pulled from Johnson's event, basically
860060	861320	leaving him high and dry.
861320	865280	His counter-protest was overrun with violence from the White Lives Matter protest, and he
865280	869080	was forced to flee from the scene by jumping into the car of another protester.
869080	873560	All of the large activist groups had abandoned him after Con Cullors made her statement,
873560	876400	and he was basically left with no people or funds.
876400	879200	Johnson later said, I don't tell people what I'm actually going through.
879200	881320	I don't tell people how stressed I actually am.
881320	883340	But you know, I actually have to live through all this.
883340	885280	They got rich off my back.
885280	889840	Regardless of how you feel about the BLN-WLM dynamic here, it's clear that this guy is
889840	893760	somebody on the ground who got fucked by the larger figures of his own movement because
893760	895760	those larger figures wanted their paycheck.
895760	901520	In the same vein, on July 25th, 2016, LA cops killed 18-year-old Richard Rishner.
901520	906320	His mother, Lisa Simpson, no not that one, got involved with the LA chapter of BLM.
906320	910360	This time, the chapter was an official one, connected to Con Cullors' larger BLM empire.
910400	914440	The LA regional director, Melina Abdullah, asked for people to donate to BLM because
914440	917360	Simpson needed $5,000 for her son's funeral.
917360	921160	After the spotlight moved on, though, Simpson received nothing from the organization.
921160	924340	BLM took the donations and cut ties with her.
924340	927300	Simpson went public with her story, joining other people who feel like they've been
927300	931880	used by BLM, with Simpson herself saying, The activists have events in our cities and
931880	935900	have not given us anything substantial for using our loved ones images and names on their
935900	936900	flyers.
937440	941120	Abdullah's response to that was to post a video on her Instagram saying that BLM was
941120	945640	under threat and that part of that threat was the mainstream media using black voices
945640	947640	to discredit BLM activists like her.
966900	973360	I want us to just be really thoughtful and be students of history and to dig deep and
973360	979520	not believe everything that you read or see, no matter who it's coming from.
979520	983600	So you know, there are people who are motivated by ego.
983600	989600	There's people who are motivated by whoever they might be working for, and sometimes they're
989600	994840	working for folks other than the people.
994840	1002700	But then there's also people who are manipulated, who have very real pain and are manipulated
1002700	1004020	by systems.
1004020	1010940	And so it's important that we do our own research, that we do our own digging.
1010940	1018740	So I don't want to repeat some of the accusations that have been made, but I want you to be
1018740	1019740	clear.
1019740	1020740	Is that my goddaughter?
1020740	1025920	Is that Erica?
1025920	1026920	Which one am I?
1026920	1029120	What are you talking about?
1029120	1032040	Melina Abdullah has her own history within the socialist space.
1032040	1035960	Her grandfather was Gunter Reitman, a member of Germany's Communist Party and part of
1035960	1037960	the underground resistance to the Nazi regime.
1037960	1042480	Notably, he wrote the book Vampire Economy, a critique of national socialist economics
1042480	1045080	and politics from an international socialist position.
1045080	1049460	Her father was an open Trotskyist in the United States, and Melina herself is also involved
1049460	1053400	in the money-go-round escapades of con colors and friends, operating front organizations
1053400	1054400	to obscure payments.
1054400	1058160	She's assaulted police at protests, she stood up for Jussie Smollett's ridiculous
1058160	1062080	con and she's an open supporter of Louis Farrakhan and his black supremacy movement.
1062080	1067080	My name is Melina Abdullah, I'm an organizer with Black Lives Matter.
1067080	1071440	I want to thank the Honorable Minister Farrakhan for having us.
1071440	1078600	We are under siege, all of us, pulling our pants up won't save us.
1078660	1082260	Our college degrees won't save us.
1082260	1085820	Middle class status won't save us.
1085820	1088180	They've declared war on us.
1088180	1092740	And the worst thing that we can do is to act as if we're at peace when we're really
1092740	1094300	at war.
1094300	1097220	Black Lives Matter is a rallying cry.
1097220	1101340	It is not for us, for them, it is for us.
1101340	1107860	Black Lives Matter is a recognition that we have all we need within us to win.
1107860	1113760	We will commit ourselves to the war that will dismantle the system of white supremacist
1113760	1115480	patriarchal capitalism.
1115480	1118880	That is what or else means.
1118880	1123840	These are the people that the BLM money went to, professional activists and revolutionaries
1123840	1128200	who provide nothing to society but racial supremacy and communist agitation.
1128200	1132200	Meanwhile, the majority of white leftists who helped BLM, they did so because it's
1132200	1133200	an easy way to virtue signal.
1133200	1137520	You drop a donation, you publish it on Twitter or Facebook, and now everyone knows that you're
1137520	1138520	one of the good ones.
1138520	1140100	You see, you're not racist.
1140100	1141660	You're giving money to BLM.
1141660	1145580	You've accepted that historic, that genetic sin that comes with your white skin.
1145580	1149060	To the progressives, BLM functions as a Catholic indulgence.
1149060	1151460	Pay enough money and your crimes are washed away.
1151460	1155740	And the corrupt Marxist leaders of the whole organization ran off with the whole pot as
1155740	1157560	Marxists always do.
1157560	1162500	There is not a single Marxist out there that truly cares about the people, the workers,
1162500	1164560	the lower class, whatever you want to call it.
1164560	1166580	They don't want to abolish hierarchy.
1166580	1170040	They don't want the stateless, moneyless, classless society.
1170040	1172620	They simply want to build their own power.
1172620	1173620	That's how it is.
1173620	1175280	That's how it always will be.
1175280	1177480	And I know how these people justify it in their heads.
1177480	1178680	They get a taste of the money.
1178680	1179860	They see how it affects their life.
1179860	1184180	They say, hey, now that I'm not worrying about making ends meet so much, I can do more activism.
1184180	1185500	I can help more people.
1185500	1188060	More of my time and energy is freed up for the cause.
1188060	1189060	That's how it begins.
1189060	1192220	They believe that helping themselves through the organization's bank account is helping
1192220	1193220	others.
1193220	1197540	To a limited extent, it actually is as long as they use that freed up time and energy
1197540	1200140	as well as most of the money to actually help others.
1200140	1201140	But they don't.
1201140	1202620	They don't have the willpower to resist the corruption.
1202620	1205940	They don't have the strength of character to take a fair cut for their work and then
1205940	1209380	continue to labor for the betterment of the people they claim to speak for.
1209380	1213900	Instead, they take and then take and then take, getting fatter and richer like the capitalist
1213900	1217700	class they claim to hate while being a part of it, contributing no labor for their taking
1217700	1221300	because they started this story by telling themselves that if they're better off, then
1221300	1223580	that leads to other people also being better off.
1223580	1226600	But they're not actually doing the work to make that connection valid.
1226600	1228920	They're just enriching themselves.
1228920	1233700	There actually is an entire underclass of black people who legitimately could use some
1233700	1235300	help in the United States.
1235300	1239920	You didn't actually think that the corpos and their bought and paid for Uncle Toms were
1239920	1241420	going to assist them, did you?
1241420	1249060	I don't know if it's worth us talking about communism because it just has such a bad rap.
1249260	1253060	Because it's failed every time, that's why it has a bad rap.
1253060	1254340	But so has capitalism.
1254340	1255340	Absolutely.
1255340	1261500	Because the U.S. is so good at propaganda and being like, it has sold the idea of the
1261500	1269700	American dream and that's tied into capitalism and wealth, it's much harder to sell communism
1269700	1272380	given that so much of the experiment has failed around the world.
