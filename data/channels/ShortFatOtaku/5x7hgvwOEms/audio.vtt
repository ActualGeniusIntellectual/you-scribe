00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
I've spoken at length about Black Lives Matter on this channel before.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.140
In August of 2020, I made a video called Where Does the BLM Money Go, tracing the financials

00:14.140 --> 00:17.500
of the various donations from the website, BlackLivesMatter.org.

00:17.500 --> 00:21.520
Most of those donations went to ActBlue, a Democrat slush fund, though some of them obviously

00:21.520 --> 00:25.420
found their way into the hands of the people who run the various Black Lives Matter groups.

00:25.420 --> 00:29.980
We know this because I put out another video in April of 2021 called Living Your Principles,

00:29.980 --> 00:33.900
where we talked about the fact that the BLM organization leader Patrisse Khan-Cullors

00:33.900 --> 00:35.260
is a trained Marxist.

00:35.260 --> 00:39.220
A video clip of her talking about Marxism went viral that everyone on the internet has

00:39.220 --> 00:40.220
been using in their videos.

00:40.220 --> 01:02.740
Yeah, that one.

01:02.740 --> 01:03.740
Don't worry though.

01:03.740 --> 01:04.740
For variety's sake, I found another.

01:04.740 --> 01:24.340
It came out in the spring of last year that Khan-Cullors used the BLM money to buy multiple

01:24.340 --> 01:27.180
homes, including a secluded compound in Topanga Canyon.

01:27.180 --> 01:31.980
I did a few other BLM videos over the years, mainly talking about various individual acts

01:31.980 --> 01:37.100
of violence, both committed by and committed to black people, and how those events related

01:37.100 --> 01:41.340
or didn't relate, contrary to popular opinion, to Black Lives Matter as a movement.

01:41.340 --> 01:43.900
But we're talking about the financial side of things again today.

01:43.900 --> 01:44.900
The reason why?

01:44.900 --> 01:48.640
Well, because I came across this tweet, BLM is missing $60 million.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.300
The headquarters doesn't exist, and the leaders have disappeared.

01:51.300 --> 01:52.300
Where is the money?

01:52.300 --> 01:56.000
Also, as a side note, nice job, Dr. Evil.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.140
First time I've ever seen a double looting.

01:58.140 --> 01:59.140
Oof.

01:59.140 --> 02:01.500
Jokes aside, what the hell is actually going on here?

02:01.540 --> 02:05.020
Well, let's start with this article from the Washington Examiner.

02:05.020 --> 02:09.060
BLM's millions unaccounted for after leaders quietly jump ship.

02:09.060 --> 02:12.260
No one appears to have been in charge of Black Lives Matter for months.

02:12.260 --> 02:16.900
The address it lists on tax forms is wrong, and the charity's two board members won't

02:16.900 --> 02:19.780
say who controls its $60 million bankroll.

02:19.780 --> 02:24.680
BLM's shocking lack of transparency surrounding its finances and operations raises major legal

02:24.680 --> 02:28.660
and ethical red flags, multiple charity experts told the Washington Examiner.

02:28.660 --> 02:33.100
Like a giant ghost ship full of treasure, drifting in the night with no captain, no

02:33.100 --> 02:37.660
discernible crew, and no clear direction, charity watch executive director Laurie Stritten

02:37.660 --> 02:38.860
said of BLM.

02:38.860 --> 02:44.260
BLM co-founder Patrice Kahn-Cullors appointed two activists to serve as the group's senior

02:44.260 --> 02:48.540
directors following her resignation in May amid scrutiny over her personal finances.

02:48.540 --> 02:50.640
That's right, I didn't do a video on this.

02:50.640 --> 02:55.380
This went down after it went viral that Kahn-Cullors was buying so many houses with the BLM money.

02:55.380 --> 02:59.500
So she decided to fade from public view, taking a deal with Warner Brothers to work

02:59.500 --> 03:04.060
on BLM-related productions to the widespread laughter everybody's smart enough to know

03:04.060 --> 03:05.660
it was all a scam early on.

03:05.660 --> 03:11.340
BLM denied allegations that Kahn-Cullors spent BLM funds on her personal properties.

03:11.340 --> 03:16.840
However, BLM and other activist organizations under Kahn-Cullors' control offered contracts

03:16.840 --> 03:19.620
to an art company led by the father of her only child.

03:19.620 --> 03:22.740
I mean, I guess that's one way to launder money.

03:22.740 --> 03:27.720
Have your wealthy charity activist organization spend all of its cash buying your relatives

03:27.720 --> 03:32.300
overpriced African artwork that you can display around various cities calling it representation,

03:32.300 --> 03:33.880
and then peace out with your cut.

03:33.880 --> 03:39.260
The story here is that Damon Turner, head of a group that does music and art-based black

03:39.260 --> 03:44.740
activism called Trap Heels, went on a progressive podcast with like 20 views called What We

03:44.740 --> 03:48.300
Gon' Do, yes that's actually the name of it, where he talks about the professional

03:48.300 --> 03:52.900
connection between his organization and Black Lives Matter through Patrice Kahn-Cullors.

04:48.300 --> 04:53.420
But, later in the podcast, he describes a birthday celebration and how Kahn-Cullors

04:53.420 --> 04:56.460
was a major part of it, sounding more like a romantic partner.

05:19.300 --> 05:24.060
And like that was the thing, then like, you know, Patrice organized like my family and

05:24.060 --> 05:28.860
friends to like send like some videos, like my, you know, head of cinematography, Giovanni

05:28.860 --> 05:34.020
cut this really beautiful 20 minute like video of people just like loving me and all these

05:34.020 --> 05:35.020
things.

05:35.020 --> 05:39.300
And then after that, like she organized a fucking like a birthday, like quarantine birthday

05:39.300 --> 05:43.460
party in the parking lot of her gallery with like all the homies pulled up and like, you

05:43.460 --> 05:47.600
know, it just felt really, just like felt really beautiful man.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.200
And on Kahn-Cullors' Instagram in 2019, she said,

06:10.200 --> 06:13.700
In other words, this guy is out here talking about Kahn-Cullors as if she's a business

06:13.700 --> 06:18.600
associate where there are two organizations, BLM and Trap Heels, are just entering into

06:18.600 --> 06:24.100
normal business deals, but in actuality, he's the father of her kid, they were in a relationship

06:24.100 --> 06:28.800
together and now they are close friends and she's funneling BLM money to her family through

06:28.800 --> 06:30.400
his organization.

06:30.400 --> 06:34.220
Also on her Instagram, I found an interview that she did as the head of a different charity

06:34.220 --> 06:38.500
organization called Dignity and Power Now, a prisoner activist group.

06:38.500 --> 06:41.760
Patrice Kahn-Cullors started that group in 2013.

06:41.760 --> 06:46.760
And public IRS records of the organization, unearthed in June of 2021, showed that they

06:46.760 --> 06:50.960
told the IRS they made less than $50,000 in 2016.

06:50.960 --> 06:54.760
But the public records of two other groups, the Resnick Foundation and the California

06:54.760 --> 07:01.200
Initiative, show that those two organizations donated $225,000 to Dignity and Power Now

07:01.200 --> 07:02.520
in 2016.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.800
Nobody knows where that money went, but I think we can take a guess.

07:05.800 --> 07:10.300
Aside from BLM and Dignity and Power Now, Patrice Kahn-Cullors also founded Justice

07:10.300 --> 07:15.340
LA and the Justice Teams Network, groups that hosted Bernie Sanders in 2018, as well

07:15.340 --> 07:16.660
as Talcum X.

07:16.660 --> 07:20.380
All of these groups seem to be fronts established to shuffle money around.

07:20.380 --> 07:26.560
For example, in 2018, the Justice Teams Network received a $400,000 grant to give to Justice

07:26.560 --> 07:31.480
LA, where it turned out that Justice LA's fund was the same fund as Dignity and Power

07:31.480 --> 07:32.480
Now.

07:32.480 --> 07:36.600
Another group connected to all of this is Reform LA Jails, which received more than

07:36.600 --> 07:39.760
$1.4 million in donations in 2019.

07:39.760 --> 07:44.200
Over half of that money was paid out to just four entities, and remember their names for

07:44.200 --> 07:45.200
later.

07:45.200 --> 07:50.560
$270,000 went to a consulting company owned by Shalomia Bowers, a person who works with

07:50.560 --> 07:53.360
Patrice Kahn-Cullors on Dignity and Power Now.

07:53.360 --> 07:58.240
$211,000 went to Asha Bandele as payment for services rendered for writing Kahn-Cullors'

07:58.240 --> 07:59.240
memoir.

07:59.240 --> 08:04.620
$205,000 to a consulting company called Janaya and Patrice Consulting, which Patrice Kahn-Cullors

08:04.620 --> 08:06.080
likely owns one half of.

08:06.080 --> 08:11.480
And $86,000 went to Trap Heels, that company run by Damon Turner, the father of Kahn-Cullors'

08:11.480 --> 08:12.480
child.

08:12.480 --> 08:20.520
Trap Heels also received $150,000 from BLM directly for running an election night livestream.

08:20.520 --> 08:24.580
So what I see happening here is that Patrice Kahn-Cullors and her colleagues and family

08:24.580 --> 08:29.740
all own these various LLCs and charity organizations and use them to obscure the shuffling around

08:29.740 --> 08:33.320
of money, the vast majority of which comes from people who are donating to Black Lives

08:33.320 --> 08:35.620
Matter thinking they're helping with racial injustice.

08:35.620 --> 08:41.220
There's been the BLM Global Network Foundation, the BLM Global Network, the BLM Action Fund,

08:41.220 --> 08:47.020
BLM Grassroots, the BLM Political Action Committee, the BLM Global Network Project, the BLM Support

08:47.020 --> 08:50.700
Fund, all of which are different organizations that these people have their hands in, as

08:50.700 --> 08:55.140
well as Dignity and Power Now, the Justice Teams Network, and Justice LA, all run by

08:55.140 --> 08:57.420
the same clique, all of them shuffling money around.

08:57.420 --> 09:01.300
In fact, there's even a completely unrelated organization called the Black Lives Matter

09:01.300 --> 09:06.220
Foundation which Google, Apple, and Microsoft all donated $4 million to without looking.

09:06.220 --> 09:11.540
And it turns out it wasn't owned by anybody in this group and in fact was a pro-police

09:11.540 --> 09:12.540
organization.

09:12.540 --> 09:13.540
Whoops.

09:13.540 --> 09:16.100
The point is though, after the money has been laundered, after it's been shuffled through

09:16.100 --> 09:20.020
all of these fronts, it doesn't actually go into helping actual real charities that provide

09:20.020 --> 09:21.020
for the poor.

09:21.020 --> 09:24.180
It instead goes into the pockets of the people running the organizations.

09:24.180 --> 09:27.800
Now that we know a few more of the players, let's keep reading that Washington Examiner

09:27.800 --> 09:30.980
article and see if any familiar names pop up.

09:30.980 --> 09:35.680
Ann Cullors announced in May she was stepping down and that activists Makani Themba and

09:35.680 --> 09:39.640
Monifa Bandele would lead the organization as senior executives.

09:39.640 --> 09:43.500
But Themba and Bandele revealed in September that they never actually took the job because

09:43.500 --> 09:46.300
of disagreements with BLM's Acting Leadership Council.

09:46.300 --> 09:50.940
Monifa Bandele, by the way, is the sister of Asha Bandele, the memoir writer who got

09:50.940 --> 09:52.980
$211,000.

09:52.980 --> 09:57.500
When an investigative reporter from The Intelligencer, who by the way was a black man, asked Bandele

09:57.500 --> 10:02.420
about the spending of Reform LA jails, he was called racist and sexist for daring to

10:02.420 --> 10:03.420
question them.

10:03.420 --> 10:07.840
Both Themba and Bandele told the Washington Examiner they do not know who took over as

10:07.840 --> 10:12.740
BLM's top executive after their departure, and neither would say who served on the council.

10:12.740 --> 10:17.700
The two remaining BLM board members, Shalomia Bowers and Raymond Howard, did not return

10:17.700 --> 10:22.100
numerous requests for comment asking who has been in charge of BLM and its money since

10:22.100 --> 10:24.060
Cullors left the charity in May.

10:24.060 --> 10:28.260
Bowers served as the treasurer for multiple activist organizations run by Khan Cullors,

10:28.260 --> 10:34.340
including a BLM PAC and a Los Angeles-based jail reform group that paid Cullors $20,000

10:34.340 --> 10:40.580
a month and dropped nearly $26,000 for meetings at a luxury Malibu beach resort in 2019.

10:40.580 --> 10:43.220
Bowers declined to comment when reached by phone on Monday.

10:43.220 --> 10:44.780
Oh, there's another name we recognize.

10:44.780 --> 10:49.660
Shalomia Bowers, the person who got $270,000 from Reform LA jails.

10:49.660 --> 10:54.020
Howard has spoken openly on Facebook about his work with BLM and his close relationship

10:54.020 --> 10:58.260
with Khan Cullors, but he appears to have recently taken steps to conceal his role within

10:58.260 --> 10:59.260
the charity.

10:59.260 --> 11:03.940
As recently as last Friday, his page was modified after the Washington Examiner contacted Howard

11:03.940 --> 11:08.020
for comment and now states he serves as the director of operations for a non-profit.

11:08.020 --> 11:12.060
A reference to Howard's position as the finance and operations manager of New Impact

11:12.060 --> 11:17.300
Partners, a Dayton, Ohio-based consulting firm owned by his sister, was also removed

11:17.300 --> 11:18.780
from his LinkedIn profile.

11:18.780 --> 11:22.780
Also as recently as last Friday, a website for New Impact Partners attributed a quote

11:22.780 --> 11:27.180
to Raymond from Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation thanking the consulting

11:27.180 --> 11:31.020
firm for its help solving BLM's organizational challenges.

11:31.020 --> 11:35.020
The attribution was removed from the website after the Washington Examiner asked Howard

11:35.020 --> 11:37.620
how much BLM has paid his sister's firm.

11:37.620 --> 11:42.340
On Tuesday, a Washington Examiner reporter attempted to request BLM's 2020 tax form

11:42.340 --> 11:47.260
990 in person at the charity's office in Los Angeles, which the group disclosed as

11:47.260 --> 11:52.160
the location its books are stored in in previous filings submitted to the IRS, only to be told

11:52.160 --> 11:56.660
by a security guard at that location there has never been a BLM office there.

11:56.660 --> 12:00.820
An unidentified BLM spokesperson informed the Washington Examiner on Thursday that the

12:00.820 --> 12:05.340
group does not currently maintain a permanent office and offered to mail a copy of its 990

12:05.340 --> 12:06.400
within two weeks.

12:06.400 --> 12:09.320
It seems to me that as soon as the public began to realize what was going on, these

12:09.320 --> 12:12.480
people began to bail out of the BLM organization.

12:12.480 --> 12:17.080
Khan Cullors and her huge home purchases went viral and then she quietly slipped away.

12:17.080 --> 12:21.240
Two other people that Cullors put in charge decided not to be the ones left holding the

12:21.240 --> 12:23.460
hot potato and so they declined the offer.

12:23.460 --> 12:27.600
And then the final two, Bowers and Howard, were left holding the BLM bag, which they

12:27.600 --> 12:31.540
promptly emptied and then tried to conceal their involvement from the rest of the world.

12:31.540 --> 12:35.000
By the way, another of those properties that Khan Cullors has bought up?

12:35.000 --> 12:39.600
It's a historic building in Toronto, notably once home to the Canadian Communist Party.

12:39.600 --> 12:45.100
The $6.3 million used to buy the building, which was previously the Wild Seed Centre

12:45.100 --> 12:49.460
for Art and Activism, was transferred from the Black Lives Matter charity to the Canadian

12:49.460 --> 12:55.580
charity M4BJ, which is run by Khan Cullors' wife, Janaya Khan.

12:55.580 --> 12:59.120
And that name, Janaya Khan, that certainly sounds familiar as well.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.600
Perhaps that's the Janaya from Janaya and Patrice Consulting, the organization that

13:02.600 --> 13:05.540
received $205,000 from LA jails.

13:05.540 --> 13:07.020
I think there's a pretty good chance of it.

13:07.020 --> 13:09.860
Vice ran a story on these two in 2017.

13:09.860 --> 13:13.440
It's a fluff piece talking about their relationship with institutional oppression, with obvious

13:13.440 --> 13:17.160
appeals to slavery and their ancestry and all this other garbage, but fuck me, look

13:17.160 --> 13:18.160
at them.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.480
Do these people look poor to you?

13:19.480 --> 13:22.600
Do they look like they're living in a crack den in the ghetto?

13:22.600 --> 13:26.480
Obviously regarding the ethics behind Black Lives Matter, nobody can object.

13:26.480 --> 13:31.040
Black people matter just as much as any other race of people, and if the point is that race-based

13:31.040 --> 13:34.040
injustices may still exist, that's obviously unacceptable.

13:34.040 --> 13:37.620
But at this point, it should be pretty clear what's going on here.

13:37.620 --> 13:42.240
Everyone who donated to BLM, the organization, the charity, the legal entity, got fucking

13:42.240 --> 13:43.240
played.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.040
I'm really sorry for all those poor people out there who might have gotten suckered into

13:46.040 --> 13:49.420
this, thinking that five extra bucks they had left over from their minimum wage job

13:49.420 --> 13:53.600
went to actually helping anybody, but instead it just lined the pockets of these grifters.

13:53.600 --> 13:59.080
There are many stories of Patrice Con Cullors shafting other people through BLM.

13:59.080 --> 14:04.120
Tori Johnson began a group called BLM Huntington Beach after the death of George Floyd.

14:04.120 --> 14:08.680
He wanted to lead a counter-protest in response to a planned White Lives Matter event.

14:08.680 --> 14:12.680
Con Cullors used her platform to denounce Johnson's event and demanded the movement

14:12.680 --> 14:15.840
focus on her own event happening at the same time instead.

14:15.840 --> 14:20.060
That public statement caused widespread support to be pulled from Johnson's event, basically

14:20.060 --> 14:21.320
leaving him high and dry.

14:21.320 --> 14:25.280
His counter-protest was overrun with violence from the White Lives Matter protest, and he

14:25.280 --> 14:29.080
was forced to flee from the scene by jumping into the car of another protester.

14:29.080 --> 14:33.560
All of the large activist groups had abandoned him after Con Cullors made her statement,

14:33.560 --> 14:36.400
and he was basically left with no people or funds.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.200
Johnson later said, I don't tell people what I'm actually going through.

14:39.200 --> 14:41.320
I don't tell people how stressed I actually am.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.340
But you know, I actually have to live through all this.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.280
They got rich off my back.

14:45.280 --> 14:49.840
Regardless of how you feel about the BLN-WLM dynamic here, it's clear that this guy is

14:49.840 --> 14:53.760
somebody on the ground who got fucked by the larger figures of his own movement because

14:53.760 --> 14:55.760
those larger figures wanted their paycheck.

14:55.760 --> 15:01.520
In the same vein, on July 25th, 2016, LA cops killed 18-year-old Richard Rishner.

15:01.520 --> 15:06.320
His mother, Lisa Simpson, no not that one, got involved with the LA chapter of BLM.

15:06.320 --> 15:10.360
This time, the chapter was an official one, connected to Con Cullors' larger BLM empire.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.440
The LA regional director, Melina Abdullah, asked for people to donate to BLM because

15:14.440 --> 15:17.360
Simpson needed $5,000 for her son's funeral.

15:17.360 --> 15:21.160
After the spotlight moved on, though, Simpson received nothing from the organization.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.340
BLM took the donations and cut ties with her.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.300
Simpson went public with her story, joining other people who feel like they've been

15:27.300 --> 15:31.880
used by BLM, with Simpson herself saying, The activists have events in our cities and

15:31.880 --> 15:35.900
have not given us anything substantial for using our loved ones images and names on their

15:35.900 --> 15:36.900
flyers.

15:37.440 --> 15:41.120
Abdullah's response to that was to post a video on her Instagram saying that BLM was

15:41.120 --> 15:45.640
under threat and that part of that threat was the mainstream media using black voices

15:45.640 --> 15:47.640
to discredit BLM activists like her.

16:06.900 --> 16:13.360
I want us to just be really thoughtful and be students of history and to dig deep and

16:13.360 --> 16:19.520
not believe everything that you read or see, no matter who it's coming from.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.600
So you know, there are people who are motivated by ego.

16:23.600 --> 16:29.600
There's people who are motivated by whoever they might be working for, and sometimes they're

16:29.600 --> 16:34.840
working for folks other than the people.

16:34.840 --> 16:42.700
But then there's also people who are manipulated, who have very real pain and are manipulated

16:42.700 --> 16:44.020
by systems.

16:44.020 --> 16:50.940
And so it's important that we do our own research, that we do our own digging.

16:50.940 --> 16:58.740
So I don't want to repeat some of the accusations that have been made, but I want you to be

16:58.740 --> 16:59.740
clear.

16:59.740 --> 17:00.740
Is that my goddaughter?

17:00.740 --> 17:05.920
Is that Erica?

17:05.920 --> 17:06.920
Which one am I?

17:06.920 --> 17:09.120
What are you talking about?

17:09.120 --> 17:12.040
Melina Abdullah has her own history within the socialist space.

17:12.040 --> 17:15.960
Her grandfather was Gunter Reitman, a member of Germany's Communist Party and part of

17:15.960 --> 17:17.960
the underground resistance to the Nazi regime.

17:17.960 --> 17:22.480
Notably, he wrote the book Vampire Economy, a critique of national socialist economics

17:22.480 --> 17:25.080
and politics from an international socialist position.

17:25.080 --> 17:29.460
Her father was an open Trotskyist in the United States, and Melina herself is also involved

17:29.460 --> 17:33.400
in the money-go-round escapades of con colors and friends, operating front organizations

17:33.400 --> 17:34.400
to obscure payments.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.160
She's assaulted police at protests, she stood up for Jussie Smollett's ridiculous

17:38.160 --> 17:42.080
con and she's an open supporter of Louis Farrakhan and his black supremacy movement.

17:42.080 --> 17:47.080
My name is Melina Abdullah, I'm an organizer with Black Lives Matter.

17:47.080 --> 17:51.440
I want to thank the Honorable Minister Farrakhan for having us.

17:51.440 --> 17:58.600
We are under siege, all of us, pulling our pants up won't save us.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.260
Our college degrees won't save us.

18:02.260 --> 18:05.820
Middle class status won't save us.

18:05.820 --> 18:08.180
They've declared war on us.

18:08.180 --> 18:12.740
And the worst thing that we can do is to act as if we're at peace when we're really

18:12.740 --> 18:14.300
at war.

18:14.300 --> 18:17.220
Black Lives Matter is a rallying cry.

18:17.220 --> 18:21.340
It is not for us, for them, it is for us.

18:21.340 --> 18:27.860
Black Lives Matter is a recognition that we have all we need within us to win.

18:27.860 --> 18:33.760
We will commit ourselves to the war that will dismantle the system of white supremacist

18:33.760 --> 18:35.480
patriarchal capitalism.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.880
That is what or else means.

18:38.880 --> 18:43.840
These are the people that the BLM money went to, professional activists and revolutionaries

18:43.840 --> 18:48.200
who provide nothing to society but racial supremacy and communist agitation.

18:48.200 --> 18:52.200
Meanwhile, the majority of white leftists who helped BLM, they did so because it's

18:52.200 --> 18:53.200
an easy way to virtue signal.

18:53.200 --> 18:57.520
You drop a donation, you publish it on Twitter or Facebook, and now everyone knows that you're

18:57.520 --> 18:58.520
one of the good ones.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.100
You see, you're not racist.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.660
You're giving money to BLM.

19:01.660 --> 19:05.580
You've accepted that historic, that genetic sin that comes with your white skin.

19:05.580 --> 19:09.060
To the progressives, BLM functions as a Catholic indulgence.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.460
Pay enough money and your crimes are washed away.

19:11.460 --> 19:15.740
And the corrupt Marxist leaders of the whole organization ran off with the whole pot as

19:15.740 --> 19:17.560
Marxists always do.

19:17.560 --> 19:22.500
There is not a single Marxist out there that truly cares about the people, the workers,

19:22.500 --> 19:24.560
the lower class, whatever you want to call it.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.580
They don't want to abolish hierarchy.

19:26.580 --> 19:30.040
They don't want the stateless, moneyless, classless society.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.620
They simply want to build their own power.

19:32.620 --> 19:33.620
That's how it is.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.280
That's how it always will be.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.480
And I know how these people justify it in their heads.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.680
They get a taste of the money.

19:38.680 --> 19:39.860
They see how it affects their life.

19:39.860 --> 19:44.180
They say, hey, now that I'm not worrying about making ends meet so much, I can do more activism.

19:44.180 --> 19:45.500
I can help more people.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.060
More of my time and energy is freed up for the cause.

19:48.060 --> 19:49.060
That's how it begins.

19:49.060 --> 19:52.220
They believe that helping themselves through the organization's bank account is helping

19:52.220 --> 19:53.220
others.

19:53.220 --> 19:57.540
To a limited extent, it actually is as long as they use that freed up time and energy

19:57.540 --> 20:00.140
as well as most of the money to actually help others.

20:00.140 --> 20:01.140
But they don't.

20:01.140 --> 20:02.620
They don't have the willpower to resist the corruption.

20:02.620 --> 20:05.940
They don't have the strength of character to take a fair cut for their work and then

20:05.940 --> 20:09.380
continue to labor for the betterment of the people they claim to speak for.

20:09.380 --> 20:13.900
Instead, they take and then take and then take, getting fatter and richer like the capitalist

20:13.900 --> 20:17.700
class they claim to hate while being a part of it, contributing no labor for their taking

20:17.700 --> 20:21.300
because they started this story by telling themselves that if they're better off, then

20:21.300 --> 20:23.580
that leads to other people also being better off.

20:23.580 --> 20:26.600
But they're not actually doing the work to make that connection valid.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.920
They're just enriching themselves.

20:28.920 --> 20:33.700
There actually is an entire underclass of black people who legitimately could use some

20:33.700 --> 20:35.300
help in the United States.

20:35.300 --> 20:39.920
You didn't actually think that the corpos and their bought and paid for Uncle Toms were

20:39.920 --> 20:41.420
going to assist them, did you?

20:41.420 --> 20:49.060
I don't know if it's worth us talking about communism because it just has such a bad rap.

20:49.260 --> 20:53.060
Because it's failed every time, that's why it has a bad rap.

20:53.060 --> 20:54.340
But so has capitalism.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.340
Absolutely.

20:55.340 --> 21:01.500
Because the U.S. is so good at propaganda and being like, it has sold the idea of the

21:01.500 --> 21:09.700
American dream and that's tied into capitalism and wealth, it's much harder to sell communism

21:09.700 --> 21:12.380
given that so much of the experiment has failed around the world.
