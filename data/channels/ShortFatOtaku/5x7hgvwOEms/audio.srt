1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I've spoken at length about Black Lives Matter on this channel before.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,140
In August of 2020, I made a video called Where Does the BLM Money Go, tracing the financials

3
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,500
of the various donations from the website, BlackLivesMatter.org.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,520
Most of those donations went to ActBlue, a Democrat slush fund, though some of them obviously

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,420
found their way into the hands of the people who run the various Black Lives Matter groups.

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,980
We know this because I put out another video in April of 2021 called Living Your Principles,

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,900
where we talked about the fact that the BLM organization leader Patrisse Khan-Cullors

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,260
is a trained Marxist.

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,220
A video clip of her talking about Marxism went viral that everyone on the internet has

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,220
been using in their videos.

11
00:00:40,220 --> 00:01:02,740
Yeah, that one.

12
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,740
Don't worry though.

13
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,740
For variety's sake, I found another.

14
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:24,340
It came out in the spring of last year that Khan-Cullors used the BLM money to buy multiple

15
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,180
homes, including a secluded compound in Topanga Canyon.

16
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,980
I did a few other BLM videos over the years, mainly talking about various individual acts

17
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:37,100
of violence, both committed by and committed to black people, and how those events related

18
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,340
or didn't relate, contrary to popular opinion, to Black Lives Matter as a movement.

19
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,900
But we're talking about the financial side of things again today.

20
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,900
The reason why?

21
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,640
Well, because I came across this tweet, BLM is missing $60 million.

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,300
The headquarters doesn't exist, and the leaders have disappeared.

23
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,300
Where is the money?

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,000
Also, as a side note, nice job, Dr. Evil.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,140
First time I've ever seen a double looting.

26
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,140
Oof.

27
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,500
Jokes aside, what the hell is actually going on here?

28
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,020
Well, let's start with this article from the Washington Examiner.

29
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,060
BLM's millions unaccounted for after leaders quietly jump ship.

30
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,260
No one appears to have been in charge of Black Lives Matter for months.

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,900
The address it lists on tax forms is wrong, and the charity's two board members won't

32
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,780
say who controls its $60 million bankroll.

33
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,680
BLM's shocking lack of transparency surrounding its finances and operations raises major legal

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,660
and ethical red flags, multiple charity experts told the Washington Examiner.

35
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,100
Like a giant ghost ship full of treasure, drifting in the night with no captain, no

36
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,660
discernible crew, and no clear direction, charity watch executive director Laurie Stritten

37
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,860
said of BLM.

38
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,260
BLM co-founder Patrice Kahn-Cullors appointed two activists to serve as the group's senior

39
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,540
directors following her resignation in May amid scrutiny over her personal finances.

40
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,640
That's right, I didn't do a video on this.

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,380
This went down after it went viral that Kahn-Cullors was buying so many houses with the BLM money.

42
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,500
So she decided to fade from public view, taking a deal with Warner Brothers to work

43
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,060
on BLM-related productions to the widespread laughter everybody's smart enough to know

44
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,660
it was all a scam early on.

45
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,340
BLM denied allegations that Kahn-Cullors spent BLM funds on her personal properties.

46
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,840
However, BLM and other activist organizations under Kahn-Cullors' control offered contracts

47
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,620
to an art company led by the father of her only child.

48
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,740
I mean, I guess that's one way to launder money.

49
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,720
Have your wealthy charity activist organization spend all of its cash buying your relatives

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,300
overpriced African artwork that you can display around various cities calling it representation,

51
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,880
and then peace out with your cut.

52
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,260
The story here is that Damon Turner, head of a group that does music and art-based black

53
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,740
activism called Trap Heels, went on a progressive podcast with like 20 views called What We

54
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,300
Gon' Do, yes that's actually the name of it, where he talks about the professional

55
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,900
connection between his organization and Black Lives Matter through Patrice Kahn-Cullors.

56
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,420
But, later in the podcast, he describes a birthday celebration and how Kahn-Cullors

57
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,460
was a major part of it, sounding more like a romantic partner.

58
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,060
And like that was the thing, then like, you know, Patrice organized like my family and

59
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,860
friends to like send like some videos, like my, you know, head of cinematography, Giovanni

60
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,020
cut this really beautiful 20 minute like video of people just like loving me and all these

61
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,020
things.

62
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,300
And then after that, like she organized a fucking like a birthday, like quarantine birthday

63
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,460
party in the parking lot of her gallery with like all the homies pulled up and like, you

64
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,600
know, it just felt really, just like felt really beautiful man.

65
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,200
And on Kahn-Cullors' Instagram in 2019, she said,

66
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,700
In other words, this guy is out here talking about Kahn-Cullors as if she's a business

67
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,600
associate where there are two organizations, BLM and Trap Heels, are just entering into

68
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,100
normal business deals, but in actuality, he's the father of her kid, they were in a relationship

69
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,800
together and now they are close friends and she's funneling BLM money to her family through

70
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,400
his organization.

71
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,220
Also on her Instagram, I found an interview that she did as the head of a different charity

72
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,500
organization called Dignity and Power Now, a prisoner activist group.

73
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,760
Patrice Kahn-Cullors started that group in 2013.

74
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,760
And public IRS records of the organization, unearthed in June of 2021, showed that they

75
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,960
told the IRS they made less than $50,000 in 2016.

76
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,760
But the public records of two other groups, the Resnick Foundation and the California

77
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:01,200
Initiative, show that those two organizations donated $225,000 to Dignity and Power Now

78
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,520
in 2016.

79
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,800
Nobody knows where that money went, but I think we can take a guess.

80
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,300
Aside from BLM and Dignity and Power Now, Patrice Kahn-Cullors also founded Justice

81
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,340
LA and the Justice Teams Network, groups that hosted Bernie Sanders in 2018, as well

82
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,660
as Talcum X.

83
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,380
All of these groups seem to be fronts established to shuffle money around.

84
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:26,560
For example, in 2018, the Justice Teams Network received a $400,000 grant to give to Justice

85
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,480
LA, where it turned out that Justice LA's fund was the same fund as Dignity and Power

86
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Now.

87
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,600
Another group connected to all of this is Reform LA Jails, which received more than

88
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,760
$1.4 million in donations in 2019.

89
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,200
Over half of that money was paid out to just four entities, and remember their names for

90
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
later.

91
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,560
$270,000 went to a consulting company owned by Shalomia Bowers, a person who works with

92
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,360
Patrice Kahn-Cullors on Dignity and Power Now.

93
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,240
$211,000 went to Asha Bandele as payment for services rendered for writing Kahn-Cullors'

94
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
memoir.

95
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,620
$205,000 to a consulting company called Janaya and Patrice Consulting, which Patrice Kahn-Cullors

96
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,080
likely owns one half of.

97
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,480
And $86,000 went to Trap Heels, that company run by Damon Turner, the father of Kahn-Cullors'

98
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
child.

99
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:20,520
Trap Heels also received $150,000 from BLM directly for running an election night livestream.

100
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,580
So what I see happening here is that Patrice Kahn-Cullors and her colleagues and family

101
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,740
all own these various LLCs and charity organizations and use them to obscure the shuffling around

102
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,320
of money, the vast majority of which comes from people who are donating to Black Lives

103
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,620
Matter thinking they're helping with racial injustice.

104
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,220
There's been the BLM Global Network Foundation, the BLM Global Network, the BLM Action Fund,

105
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:47,020
BLM Grassroots, the BLM Political Action Committee, the BLM Global Network Project, the BLM Support

106
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,700
Fund, all of which are different organizations that these people have their hands in, as

107
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,140
well as Dignity and Power Now, the Justice Teams Network, and Justice LA, all run by

108
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,420
the same clique, all of them shuffling money around.

109
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,300
In fact, there's even a completely unrelated organization called the Black Lives Matter

110
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,220
Foundation which Google, Apple, and Microsoft all donated $4 million to without looking.

111
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,540
And it turns out it wasn't owned by anybody in this group and in fact was a pro-police

112
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,540
organization.

113
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,540
Whoops.

114
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,100
The point is though, after the money has been laundered, after it's been shuffled through

115
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,020
all of these fronts, it doesn't actually go into helping actual real charities that provide

116
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,020
for the poor.

117
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,180
It instead goes into the pockets of the people running the organizations.

118
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,800
Now that we know a few more of the players, let's keep reading that Washington Examiner

119
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,980
article and see if any familiar names pop up.

120
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,680
Ann Cullors announced in May she was stepping down and that activists Makani Themba and

121
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,640
Monifa Bandele would lead the organization as senior executives.

122
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,500
But Themba and Bandele revealed in September that they never actually took the job because

123
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,300
of disagreements with BLM's Acting Leadership Council.

124
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,940
Monifa Bandele, by the way, is the sister of Asha Bandele, the memoir writer who got

125
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,980
$211,000.

126
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,500
When an investigative reporter from The Intelligencer, who by the way was a black man, asked Bandele

127
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,420
about the spending of Reform LA jails, he was called racist and sexist for daring to

128
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,420
question them.

129
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,840
Both Themba and Bandele told the Washington Examiner they do not know who took over as

130
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,740
BLM's top executive after their departure, and neither would say who served on the council.

131
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,700
The two remaining BLM board members, Shalomia Bowers and Raymond Howard, did not return

132
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,100
numerous requests for comment asking who has been in charge of BLM and its money since

133
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,060
Cullors left the charity in May.

134
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,260
Bowers served as the treasurer for multiple activist organizations run by Khan Cullors,

135
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:34,340
including a BLM PAC and a Los Angeles-based jail reform group that paid Cullors $20,000

136
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:40,580
a month and dropped nearly $26,000 for meetings at a luxury Malibu beach resort in 2019.

137
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,220
Bowers declined to comment when reached by phone on Monday.

138
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,780
Oh, there's another name we recognize.

139
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,660
Shalomia Bowers, the person who got $270,000 from Reform LA jails.

140
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,020
Howard has spoken openly on Facebook about his work with BLM and his close relationship

141
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,260
with Khan Cullors, but he appears to have recently taken steps to conceal his role within

142
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,260
the charity.

143
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,940
As recently as last Friday, his page was modified after the Washington Examiner contacted Howard

144
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,020
for comment and now states he serves as the director of operations for a non-profit.

145
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,060
A reference to Howard's position as the finance and operations manager of New Impact

146
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,300
Partners, a Dayton, Ohio-based consulting firm owned by his sister, was also removed

147
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,780
from his LinkedIn profile.

148
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,780
Also as recently as last Friday, a website for New Impact Partners attributed a quote

149
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,180
to Raymond from Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation thanking the consulting

150
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,020
firm for its help solving BLM's organizational challenges.

151
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,020
The attribution was removed from the website after the Washington Examiner asked Howard

152
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,620
how much BLM has paid his sister's firm.

153
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,340
On Tuesday, a Washington Examiner reporter attempted to request BLM's 2020 tax form

154
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,260
990 in person at the charity's office in Los Angeles, which the group disclosed as

155
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,160
the location its books are stored in in previous filings submitted to the IRS, only to be told

156
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,660
by a security guard at that location there has never been a BLM office there.

157
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,820
An unidentified BLM spokesperson informed the Washington Examiner on Thursday that the

158
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,340
group does not currently maintain a permanent office and offered to mail a copy of its 990

159
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,400
within two weeks.

160
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,320
It seems to me that as soon as the public began to realize what was going on, these

161
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,480
people began to bail out of the BLM organization.

162
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,080
Khan Cullors and her huge home purchases went viral and then she quietly slipped away.

163
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,240
Two other people that Cullors put in charge decided not to be the ones left holding the

164
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,460
hot potato and so they declined the offer.

165
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:27,600
And then the final two, Bowers and Howard, were left holding the BLM bag, which they

166
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,540
promptly emptied and then tried to conceal their involvement from the rest of the world.

167
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,000
By the way, another of those properties that Khan Cullors has bought up?

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,600
It's a historic building in Toronto, notably once home to the Canadian Communist Party.

169
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,100
The $6.3 million used to buy the building, which was previously the Wild Seed Centre

170
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,460
for Art and Activism, was transferred from the Black Lives Matter charity to the Canadian

171
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:55,580
charity M4BJ, which is run by Khan Cullors' wife, Janaya Khan.

172
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,120
And that name, Janaya Khan, that certainly sounds familiar as well.

173
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,600
Perhaps that's the Janaya from Janaya and Patrice Consulting, the organization that

174
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,540
received $205,000 from LA jails.

175
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,020
I think there's a pretty good chance of it.

176
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,860
Vice ran a story on these two in 2017.

177
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,440
It's a fluff piece talking about their relationship with institutional oppression, with obvious

178
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,160
appeals to slavery and their ancestry and all this other garbage, but fuck me, look

179
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
at them.

180
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,480
Do these people look poor to you?

181
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,600
Do they look like they're living in a crack den in the ghetto?

182
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,480
Obviously regarding the ethics behind Black Lives Matter, nobody can object.

183
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,040
Black people matter just as much as any other race of people, and if the point is that race-based

184
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,040
injustices may still exist, that's obviously unacceptable.

185
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,620
But at this point, it should be pretty clear what's going on here.

186
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,240
Everyone who donated to BLM, the organization, the charity, the legal entity, got fucking

187
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
played.

188
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,040
I'm really sorry for all those poor people out there who might have gotten suckered into

189
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,420
this, thinking that five extra bucks they had left over from their minimum wage job

190
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,600
went to actually helping anybody, but instead it just lined the pockets of these grifters.

191
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,080
There are many stories of Patrice Con Cullors shafting other people through BLM.

192
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,120
Tori Johnson began a group called BLM Huntington Beach after the death of George Floyd.

193
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,680
He wanted to lead a counter-protest in response to a planned White Lives Matter event.

194
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Con Cullors used her platform to denounce Johnson's event and demanded the movement

195
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,840
focus on her own event happening at the same time instead.

196
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,060
That public statement caused widespread support to be pulled from Johnson's event, basically

197
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,320
leaving him high and dry.

198
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,280
His counter-protest was overrun with violence from the White Lives Matter protest, and he

199
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,080
was forced to flee from the scene by jumping into the car of another protester.

200
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,560
All of the large activist groups had abandoned him after Con Cullors made her statement,

201
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,400
and he was basically left with no people or funds.

202
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,200
Johnson later said, I don't tell people what I'm actually going through.

203
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,320
I don't tell people how stressed I actually am.

204
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,340
But you know, I actually have to live through all this.

205
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,280
They got rich off my back.

206
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,840
Regardless of how you feel about the BLN-WLM dynamic here, it's clear that this guy is

207
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,760
somebody on the ground who got fucked by the larger figures of his own movement because

208
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
those larger figures wanted their paycheck.

209
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,520
In the same vein, on July 25th, 2016, LA cops killed 18-year-old Richard Rishner.

210
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,320
His mother, Lisa Simpson, no not that one, got involved with the LA chapter of BLM.

211
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,360
This time, the chapter was an official one, connected to Con Cullors' larger BLM empire.

212
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,440
The LA regional director, Melina Abdullah, asked for people to donate to BLM because

213
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,360
Simpson needed $5,000 for her son's funeral.

214
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,160
After the spotlight moved on, though, Simpson received nothing from the organization.

215
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,340
BLM took the donations and cut ties with her.

216
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,300
Simpson went public with her story, joining other people who feel like they've been

217
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,880
used by BLM, with Simpson herself saying, The activists have events in our cities and

218
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,900
have not given us anything substantial for using our loved ones images and names on their

219
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,900
flyers.

220
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,120
Abdullah's response to that was to post a video on her Instagram saying that BLM was

221
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,640
under threat and that part of that threat was the mainstream media using black voices

222
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,640
to discredit BLM activists like her.

223
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:13,360
I want us to just be really thoughtful and be students of history and to dig deep and

224
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,520
not believe everything that you read or see, no matter who it's coming from.

225
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,600
So you know, there are people who are motivated by ego.

226
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,600
There's people who are motivated by whoever they might be working for, and sometimes they're

227
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,840
working for folks other than the people.

228
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:42,700
But then there's also people who are manipulated, who have very real pain and are manipulated

229
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,020
by systems.

230
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:50,940
And so it's important that we do our own research, that we do our own digging.

231
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:58,740
So I don't want to repeat some of the accusations that have been made, but I want you to be

232
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,740
clear.

233
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
Is that my goddaughter?

234
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,920
Is that Erica?

235
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
Which one am I?

236
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,120
What are you talking about?

237
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,040
Melina Abdullah has her own history within the socialist space.

238
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,960
Her grandfather was Gunter Reitman, a member of Germany's Communist Party and part of

239
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
the underground resistance to the Nazi regime.

240
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,480
Notably, he wrote the book Vampire Economy, a critique of national socialist economics

241
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,080
and politics from an international socialist position.

242
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,460
Her father was an open Trotskyist in the United States, and Melina herself is also involved

243
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,400
in the money-go-round escapades of con colors and friends, operating front organizations

244
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
to obscure payments.

245
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,160
She's assaulted police at protests, she stood up for Jussie Smollett's ridiculous

246
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,080
con and she's an open supporter of Louis Farrakhan and his black supremacy movement.

247
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,080
My name is Melina Abdullah, I'm an organizer with Black Lives Matter.

248
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,440
I want to thank the Honorable Minister Farrakhan for having us.

249
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,600
We are under siege, all of us, pulling our pants up won't save us.

250
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,260
Our college degrees won't save us.

251
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,820
Middle class status won't save us.

252
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,180
They've declared war on us.

253
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,740
And the worst thing that we can do is to act as if we're at peace when we're really

254
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,300
at war.

255
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,220
Black Lives Matter is a rallying cry.

256
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,340
It is not for us, for them, it is for us.

257
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:27,860
Black Lives Matter is a recognition that we have all we need within us to win.

258
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:33,760
We will commit ourselves to the war that will dismantle the system of white supremacist

259
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,480
patriarchal capitalism.

260
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,880
That is what or else means.

261
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,840
These are the people that the BLM money went to, professional activists and revolutionaries

262
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,200
who provide nothing to society but racial supremacy and communist agitation.

263
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Meanwhile, the majority of white leftists who helped BLM, they did so because it's

264
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
an easy way to virtue signal.

265
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,520
You drop a donation, you publish it on Twitter or Facebook, and now everyone knows that you're

266
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
one of the good ones.

267
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,100
You see, you're not racist.

268
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,660
You're giving money to BLM.

269
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,580
You've accepted that historic, that genetic sin that comes with your white skin.

270
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,060
To the progressives, BLM functions as a Catholic indulgence.

271
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,460
Pay enough money and your crimes are washed away.

272
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,740
And the corrupt Marxist leaders of the whole organization ran off with the whole pot as

273
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,560
Marxists always do.

274
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,500
There is not a single Marxist out there that truly cares about the people, the workers,

275
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,560
the lower class, whatever you want to call it.

276
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,580
They don't want to abolish hierarchy.

277
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,040
They don't want the stateless, moneyless, classless society.

278
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,620
They simply want to build their own power.

279
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,620
That's how it is.

280
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,280
That's how it always will be.

281
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,480
And I know how these people justify it in their heads.

282
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,680
They get a taste of the money.

283
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,860
They see how it affects their life.

284
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:44,180
They say, hey, now that I'm not worrying about making ends meet so much, I can do more activism.

285
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,500
I can help more people.

286
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,060
More of my time and energy is freed up for the cause.

287
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,060
That's how it begins.

288
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,220
They believe that helping themselves through the organization's bank account is helping

289
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
others.

290
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,540
To a limited extent, it actually is as long as they use that freed up time and energy

291
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,140
as well as most of the money to actually help others.

292
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,140
But they don't.

293
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,620
They don't have the willpower to resist the corruption.

294
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,940
They don't have the strength of character to take a fair cut for their work and then

295
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,380
continue to labor for the betterment of the people they claim to speak for.

296
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,900
Instead, they take and then take and then take, getting fatter and richer like the capitalist

297
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,700
class they claim to hate while being a part of it, contributing no labor for their taking

298
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,300
because they started this story by telling themselves that if they're better off, then

299
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,580
that leads to other people also being better off.

300
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,600
But they're not actually doing the work to make that connection valid.

301
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,920
They're just enriching themselves.

302
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,700
There actually is an entire underclass of black people who legitimately could use some

303
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,300
help in the United States.

304
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,920
You didn't actually think that the corpos and their bought and paid for Uncle Toms were

305
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,420
going to assist them, did you?

306
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:49,060
I don't know if it's worth us talking about communism because it just has such a bad rap.

307
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,060
Because it's failed every time, that's why it has a bad rap.

308
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,340
But so has capitalism.

309
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,340
Absolutely.

310
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:01,500
Because the U.S. is so good at propaganda and being like, it has sold the idea of the

311
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:09,700
American dream and that's tied into capitalism and wealth, it's much harder to sell communism

312
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,380
given that so much of the experiment has failed around the world.
