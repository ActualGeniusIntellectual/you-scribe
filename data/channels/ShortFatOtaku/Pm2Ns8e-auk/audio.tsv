0	10660	There's been a slow burn regarding the right wing and the general acceptance of gay people.
10660	14600	In the early 2010s, it felt like the age of the religious right was over.
14600	19120	People were generally okay with gays and lesbians being around invisible in society.
19120	22880	Gay marriage had arrived to the West, and seemed to be going okay, and some conservatives
22880	27480	understood that monogamy could be the glue that keeps a gay couple together and away
27480	32280	from what was frankly pretty self-destructive behavior that gay people were known for in
32280	35720	the 70s and 80s, just as it had done for straight couples.
35720	40840	In fact, the right wing argument against immigration from a decade ago was that if, for example,
40840	44900	a Western nation became a majority Muslim one, all of those gay rights that we as a
44900	49440	liberal society value would be rolled back due to the growing religious extremism.
49440	54360	It was surprising for me, yet welcome, to see the new young crop of right wingers begin
54360	56280	to adopt these positions.
56280	60500	But unfortunately, I think the right wing is shifting back into the old mold.
60500	65080	It started with more extreme elements, saying that traditional society is based, actually,
65080	69920	and that Russian orthodoxy or Muslim fundamentalism were finally pushing back against the degenerate
69920	71520	atheistic liberal world.
71520	77480	Now, part of this shift was absolutely spurred on by the growing politicization of the LGBTQ
77480	80080	movement after gay marriage was achieved in America.
80080	83640	The argument before gay marriage was equal rights, and that was a good argument.
83640	85680	It meant integration into liberal society.
85680	89700	But that isn't the way the activists think anymore, much to the chagrin of older gay
89700	92720	and trans people who, frankly, just want to be left alone.
92720	96800	But a few weeks ago, I saw people who I generally view to be reasonable, on the right, take
96800	99320	up positions that I never thought would make a return.
99320	103200	I know Jeremy, the quartering, to personally be an agreeable guy, but I can't agree with
103200	104200	him here.
104200	109440	Dave Rubin, Pete Buttigieg, Shane Dawson, rich gay men who use their status to purchase
109440	111920	babies as props for internet clout.
111920	116440	All three rush to post their purchases to socials moments after being ripped from their
116440	117440	birth mothers.
117440	119880	It's disgusting, and I'm tired of pretending it's not.
119880	123720	What the quartering is talking about here is the successful surrogacies of these three
123720	125520	high-profile gay men.
125520	129940	All of them are following the path that was laid out for them a decade ago for gay acceptance.
129940	133080	Stop having promiscuous sex and emulate heterosexual couples.
133080	136560	Monogamous married life, have a productive job, house, and kids.
136560	138640	Try to be a positive part of the community.
138640	142440	But now the complaint is that because these gay men wanted to have children that they
142440	145680	were biologically related to, and therefore they had the kids through surrogacy, where
145680	149680	a woman agrees to carry the child for them, that this was somehow immoral.
149680	153400	And while it wasn't just the quartering who jumped in on this conversation, he was probably
153400	155880	the most high-profile person involved in it.
155880	159880	He posted this picture of one of the men holding their newborn in what appears to be a hospital
159880	163800	setting, with the caption, this poor child is likely trying to latch to his mother's
163800	169240	breast for life-sustaining milk, but instead gets a weird mouthful of gay man chest hair
169240	172000	who bought the thing and likely thinks it feels weird.
172000	175320	This is fucking unhinged dude, he's just holding a baby.
175320	178600	When it was pointed out that the picture doesn't actually show the baby trying to suckle at
178600	183000	his breast Peter Griffin style, the quartering replied with, children are not accessories
183000	187640	and shouldn't be grown in a lab for weirdos to post pictures online larping as a mom or
187640	188640	dad.
188640	190100	So let's look at their arguments.
190100	194340	Some of them are saying that it's human trafficking, that because surrogates generally get paid
194340	198940	in exchange for giving up their time and energy and body for nine months, the couple is buying
198940	202500	a baby, they're buying another human, and that the woman themselves only agreed to do
202500	206740	it because they're poor, making it exploitative in the same way that prostitution is.
206740	209660	But this doesn't seem to be the case, at least in the States.
209660	213360	Most women who agree to be surrogates tend to be middle-class, married, and Christian,
213360	217520	who report enjoying the feeling of being pregnant and wanting to help others who can't have
217520	218780	kids of their own.
218780	223380	Nonetheless, this view of surrogacy as inherently exploitative isn't a fringe one.
223380	227780	For example, back in 2016, Sweden's parliament published an inquiry into surrogacy, recommending
227780	231700	that the country ban all of it, commercial as well as altruistic, as well as preventing
231700	234280	Swedish citizens from going overseas to do it.
234280	238460	The argument about women being exploited applies only to commercial surrogacy.
238460	241260	So why do they also reject altruistic surrogacy?
241260	244780	The report stated that it's unreasonable for women to sign away the rights to a baby she
244780	246740	doesn't even know or seen yet.
246740	250220	But fair enough, there are many cases of surrogate mothers who, after having given
250220	253660	birth, desperately want to renege on the agreement and keep the kid.
253660	256700	The other side of the argument, though, is that the report seems to imply that women
256700	260500	who choose to be surrogates aren't really capable of deciding these sorts of bodily
260500	263820	autonomy questions for themselves, which also just isn't true.
263820	268060	The next argument is that it's because the parents are gay and therefore this is immoral.
268060	271860	The quartering said in a reply to straight couples using surrogacy as an option, I tolerate
271860	274380	that because at least the baby has a mother and father.
274380	278060	I still detest how rich straight couples use it, Hollywood, etc.
278060	282020	This is an extension of the all surrogacy is wrong argument because kids should know
282020	283460	their actual parents.
283460	286820	But it's especially wrong for gay people to do it because the kid wouldn't even have
286820	288660	a parent of the other sex.
288660	291780	Of course, this is also an argument against adoption, because adopted kids don't know
291780	293020	their parents either.
293020	297740	And in its most extreme form, this logic leads to kids remaining with clearly unfit parents
297740	299380	because they are their parents.
299380	302500	Of course, the quartering didn't say that, but that is where the logic naturally leads
302500	303680	once developed.
303680	307520	The third argument is that gay parents abuse their children at higher rates.
307520	311380	A few stories of this actually happening began to circulate during this time.
311380	315720	One where a gay couple sexually abused their adopted sons while also pimping them out to
315720	316840	other men.
316840	320840	Another where a gay couple hired a Russian surrogate to carry their child, only to immediately
320840	325040	begin recording themselves sexually abusing the baby and sharing the video on the dark
325040	326040	web.
326040	330160	The police uncovered evidence that this was their sole reason for obtaining the child.
330160	333720	The first two arguments were moral ones, on which there is significant disagreement from
333720	334720	the get-go.
334720	338580	The first one, that surrogacy is child trafficking because you're buying a child, is frankly
338580	339920	a matter of interpretation.
339920	343900	I personally feel like commercial surrogacy skirts the line a bit too close for my comfort,
343900	346880	but the people who voluntarily do it out of the goodness of their hearts, that's their
346880	348320	choice and not yours.
348320	352320	The second one, that surrogacy takes kids away from their real parents, while true,
352320	354560	isn't necessarily indicative of any wrongdoing.
354560	358080	We take kids away from their parents all the time, when the parents are bad.
358080	360880	Parents also give up their kids for adoption all the time as well.
360880	362320	Should both of these things stop?
362320	363520	I don't think so.
363520	367800	To me, the second argument just isn't persuasive, especially if the surrogate parents aren't
367800	369700	actually abusing their kids.
369700	372560	Which then leads us to the third argument, what if they are?
372560	376640	Or more generally, what if gay parents are actually just naturally worse at being parents,
376640	379680	whether that's because they have a higher chance of abusing their kids, or because kids
379680	383160	miss out on having a parent of either sex around, or any other factor?
383160	386600	Well that's a data argument, not a moral one, and we do have data to look at.
386600	391440	Now progressives generally don't like looking at the data on this topic, because, uh, spoilers,
391440	395800	it doesn't look that good for the gays, and in fact, they tend to call you a bigot
395800	399640	or a Nazi if you dare to examine what's actually happening here.
399640	402220	But we can be a bit more intellectually honest than they are.
402220	408760	A study in 2005 examined child molestation by gay parents in Illinois from 1997 to 2002,
408760	414080	and found that 34% of the parents of foster kids or adopted kids homosexually abused those
414080	418040	parents, meaning mothers sexually abusing daughters and fathers sexually abusing sons.
418040	422000	It doesn't say how many of those abusers were in straight or gay relationships, though,
422000	426320	and it is conceivable that an abuser who is nominally straight still sexually abuses a
426320	430960	child of the same sex out of a power-based desire, not a homosexual one.
430960	436560	Another study, also from 2005, examined cases of child sexual abuse by foster parents reported
436560	439920	in the news from 1980 to 2003.
439920	444320	The cases in which the abuse was homosexual was extremely disproportionate to the actual
444320	447520	gay population, and the vast majority of abusers were men.
447520	449000	It's not just abuse, though.
449000	453040	A 2013 study showed that the children of gay couples were less likely to graduate high
453040	454040	school.
454040	458320	A 1996 study in Australia showed that both success in school and social development were
458320	462800	highest among kids of married straight couples, lower among cohabitating straight couples,
462800	464200	and lowest among gay couples.
464200	469420	There's similar results from two 2012 studies regarding the kids of gay relationships and
469420	470680	school success.
470680	475380	A 2009 study showed that the adult children of gay couples have a harder time with intimacy,
475380	478140	trust, and the ability to build relationships.
478140	482080	Another 2012 study showed that the adult children of gay couples suffered from a broad range
482080	483940	of emotional and social problems.
483940	489020	A 2013 study, not about kids raised by gay couples specifically, but about kids of surrogacy
489020	493560	in general, showed adjustment difficulties throughout youth and puberty of the kids who
493560	495860	knew that they were a product of surrogacy.
495860	501420	And a 2015 study found that after controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic
501420	506220	status, the children of gay couples were more than twice as likely to have ADHD than the
506220	508060	children of straight couples.
508060	512280	So far, it seems like the idea that gay people are just like straight people and just as
512280	514780	capable of raising children might not be accurate.
514780	520580	And the progressive reply to this data seems to be to just ignore it for ideological reasons.
520580	522100	But there is a silver lining.
522140	526260	A study out of the Netherlands shows that after adjusting for cultural stressors associated
526260	531320	with being gay, there are no significant disadvantages between kids of gay parents and kids of straight
531320	532320	parents.
532320	537700	A 2023 study examining data collected between 2015 and 2022 determined that the mental health
537700	542280	gap between kids of gay couples and kids of straight couples had largely disappeared compared
542280	543580	to earlier studies.
543580	548460	In a 2006 study examining gay marriage showed that when gay couples were married, their
548460	553000	children tended to enjoy the same benefits of marriage that straight children did.
553000	556740	So it might be the case that some of this stuff is social, and we're seeing those problems
556740	560000	slowly alleviate as gay acceptance has increased over time.
560000	563340	Maybe your knee-jerk response to this is to say, well, those studies are new, they're
563340	566700	obviously biased, we should just ignore them and trust the old ones.
566700	569980	But then you'd be in the exact same camp as the progressives who don't want to look at
569980	573600	the old studies at all, ignoring data for ideological reasons.
573600	578000	The truth seems to be that while there are significant differences between the children
578000	582460	of straight relationships and the children of gay relationships, the playing field is
582460	586380	leveling out over time, and it's happening as gay acceptance increases.
586380	590680	It's not just that, though, because healthier gay behavior on the part of the parents is
590680	595380	also likely contributing to the alleviation through creating a more stable home situation.
595380	602180	A study from 1998 showed that pre-1994 gay men had, on average, a 20-year shorter lifespan,
602180	604220	mainly due to drug use and HIV.
604440	608620	Obviously, the choice to have bug-spreading sex and do drugs constantly is an individual
608620	609620	one.
609620	611280	But where do we pinpoint the source of that behavior?
611280	615240	Are gay men just naturally degenerate since there's no risk of pregnancy with their sexual
615240	616240	activity?
616240	619960	Is this a product of them being cast out of society and developing an outsider culture
619960	623880	that rejects all things heteronormative, even if it's good for them?
623880	624880	I don't know.
624880	629560	But if the reduced 20-year lifespan comes from drugs and HIV, and a gay man nowadays
629560	633500	chooses a healthier lifestyle with no drugs and monogamy instead, I can't see this being
633500	634620	applicable to him.
634620	638100	Of course, even now, the popular gay subculture isn't helping things.
638100	641980	The whole monkey pox thing from a couple years ago spread primarily among the gay community
641980	643380	for a reason.
643380	646980	Poppers are well-known in the gay community as the go-to sex drug, and it's like, what
646980	647980	the fuck, dude?
647980	652660	Why are there so many burnouts that a whole-ass sexual orientation has a go-to sex drug?
652660	656620	And when one in eight sexually active gay men in London have HIV, you know that there's
656620	659780	a problem with at least that city's gay nightlife.
659780	664300	Even if gay people can buck the trend of unhealthy behaviors, it seems like a lot of
664300	665300	them aren't.
665300	667460	Or at least, progress in that regard is slow-going.
667460	671040	And as long as these problems are present, the people who have those problems just are
671040	672420	not parent material.
672420	674700	It's not clear what the root cause is, though.
674700	677740	It is true that gay people tend to have more abusive parents.
677740	681900	But does the abuse make them gay, or are they being abused for coming out as gay?
681900	682900	That I doesn't say.
682900	687040	Do gay men behave this self-destructively due to living in a homophobic society?
687040	691200	Is the gay subculture overly sexual and degenerate as a defense mechanism?
691200	694400	Are gay people just overly sexual and degenerate themselves?
694400	698520	Do the kids of gay couples experience their issues because they lack a parent of the other
698520	700040	sex to properly model?
700040	704460	Or is it because gay parents are simply more dysfunctional individuals than straight ones,
704460	706280	due to any of these reasons?
706280	711160	I personally wouldn't be surprised if, in a perfectly inclusive society, with everyone
711160	715880	being ideal parents, with none of these social problems, straight couples were still just
715880	719280	better for kids than gay couples, at least a tiny bit.
719280	723640	Some of these problems that the kids experience are likely just endemic to having gay parents,
723640	725600	probably regarding the modeling stuff.
725600	730200	But considering that the huge gap between them is closing, as both society becomes more
730200	735000	inclusive of gay parents, and as gay people themselves stop acting like degenerates, I
735000	738920	think way more of the problem is not just endemic to being gay.
738920	743180	The gay inclusive conservatives of 10 years ago, rest in peace, were probably correct
743180	747020	when they said that the gay community is made better by their inclusion in married
747020	748020	life.
748020	752820	Now, those high-profile sexual exploitation cases are still very serious, and we can't
752820	757100	simply hand-wave away the data showing that gay men are more likely to sexually abuse
757100	758100	their kids.
758100	761780	Crying about homophobia and bigotry doesn't refute the numbers, and it certainly doesn't
761780	763780	make the lives of those child victims any better.
763780	766400	But obviously, not all gay people do this.
766400	771140	And more importantly, we wouldn't use this logic to blanket restrict any other demographic's
771140	774380	ability to adopt or foster or get a surrogate to carry their child.
774380	778780	For example, a step-parent is way more likely to abuse a child than a gay parent is.
778780	782220	And yet, we still allow good step-parents to adopt their partner's children.
782220	785300	And when possible, we try to protect children from bad step-parents.
785300	789700	We're not that successful at it right now, yeah, but we don't use the prevalence of
789700	794320	step-parent abuse to justify barring step-parents from adopting kids.
794320	796420	We take an individualist approach.
796420	799860	The good ones should be free to live their lives unimpeded, and the bad ones should be
799860	802060	apprehended and brought to justice.
802060	804880	Why wouldn't we use the same logic for gay parents?
804880	808580	It would not be justified to take the children away from a good gay couple because of the
808580	810980	actions of high-profile bad gay couples.
810980	814020	And this is the main reason why I reject the arguments of the quartering and the others
814020	815280	on this topic.
815280	818440	Liberal individualism is, once again, the answer.
818440	822520	Even if gay parents are less likely to be good parents based on the data, individuals
822520	824060	buck trends all the time.
824060	828280	Good gay parents can exist, they do exist, obviously, and they shouldn't be restricted
828280	831020	just because other bad ones also exist.
831020	834020	The other complaints about how is child trafficking or whatever, they just don't stand up to
834020	835020	scrutiny in my view.
835020	836020	How about this?
836020	838640	If you're a right-winger and watching this and you disagree with my take, you think that
838640	841780	the gays are just super dangerous to kids, you've seen those terrible news headlines
841780	843640	with your own eyes and you can't be convinced otherwise.
843640	845260	Let me put it this way.
845260	848680	Those stories make the news in the first place because they're unusual.
848680	851600	The news generally doesn't report on things that regularly happen.
851600	854920	That's your logic on why the news have stopped reporting on when black people commit crime,
854920	855920	right?
