1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,660
There's been a slow burn regarding the right wing and the general acceptance of gay people.

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,600
In the early 2010s, it felt like the age of the religious right was over.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,120
People were generally okay with gays and lesbians being around invisible in society.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,880
Gay marriage had arrived to the West, and seemed to be going okay, and some conservatives

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,480
understood that monogamy could be the glue that keeps a gay couple together and away

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,280
from what was frankly pretty self-destructive behavior that gay people were known for in

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,720
the 70s and 80s, just as it had done for straight couples.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,840
In fact, the right wing argument against immigration from a decade ago was that if, for example,

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,900
a Western nation became a majority Muslim one, all of those gay rights that we as a

10
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,440
liberal society value would be rolled back due to the growing religious extremism.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,360
It was surprising for me, yet welcome, to see the new young crop of right wingers begin

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,280
to adopt these positions.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,500
But unfortunately, I think the right wing is shifting back into the old mold.

14
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,080
It started with more extreme elements, saying that traditional society is based, actually,

15
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,920
and that Russian orthodoxy or Muslim fundamentalism were finally pushing back against the degenerate

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,520
atheistic liberal world.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,480
Now, part of this shift was absolutely spurred on by the growing politicization of the LGBTQ

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,080
movement after gay marriage was achieved in America.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,640
The argument before gay marriage was equal rights, and that was a good argument.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,680
It meant integration into liberal society.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,700
But that isn't the way the activists think anymore, much to the chagrin of older gay

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,720
and trans people who, frankly, just want to be left alone.

23
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,800
But a few weeks ago, I saw people who I generally view to be reasonable, on the right, take

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,320
up positions that I never thought would make a return.

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,200
I know Jeremy, the quartering, to personally be an agreeable guy, but I can't agree with

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
him here.

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,440
Dave Rubin, Pete Buttigieg, Shane Dawson, rich gay men who use their status to purchase

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,920
babies as props for internet clout.

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,440
All three rush to post their purchases to socials moments after being ripped from their

30
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
birth mothers.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,880
It's disgusting, and I'm tired of pretending it's not.

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,720
What the quartering is talking about here is the successful surrogacies of these three

33
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,520
high-profile gay men.

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,940
All of them are following the path that was laid out for them a decade ago for gay acceptance.

35
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,080
Stop having promiscuous sex and emulate heterosexual couples.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,560
Monogamous married life, have a productive job, house, and kids.

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,640
Try to be a positive part of the community.

38
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,440
But now the complaint is that because these gay men wanted to have children that they

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,680
were biologically related to, and therefore they had the kids through surrogacy, where

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,680
a woman agrees to carry the child for them, that this was somehow immoral.

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,400
And while it wasn't just the quartering who jumped in on this conversation, he was probably

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,880
the most high-profile person involved in it.

43
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,880
He posted this picture of one of the men holding their newborn in what appears to be a hospital

44
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,800
setting, with the caption, this poor child is likely trying to latch to his mother's

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,240
breast for life-sustaining milk, but instead gets a weird mouthful of gay man chest hair

46
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,000
who bought the thing and likely thinks it feels weird.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,320
This is fucking unhinged dude, he's just holding a baby.

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,600
When it was pointed out that the picture doesn't actually show the baby trying to suckle at

49
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,000
his breast Peter Griffin style, the quartering replied with, children are not accessories

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,640
and shouldn't be grown in a lab for weirdos to post pictures online larping as a mom or

51
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
dad.

52
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,100
So let's look at their arguments.

53
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,340
Some of them are saying that it's human trafficking, that because surrogates generally get paid

54
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,940
in exchange for giving up their time and energy and body for nine months, the couple is buying

55
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,500
a baby, they're buying another human, and that the woman themselves only agreed to do

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,740
it because they're poor, making it exploitative in the same way that prostitution is.

57
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,660
But this doesn't seem to be the case, at least in the States.

58
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,360
Most women who agree to be surrogates tend to be middle-class, married, and Christian,

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,520
who report enjoying the feeling of being pregnant and wanting to help others who can't have

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,780
kids of their own.

61
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,380
Nonetheless, this view of surrogacy as inherently exploitative isn't a fringe one.

62
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,780
For example, back in 2016, Sweden's parliament published an inquiry into surrogacy, recommending

63
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,700
that the country ban all of it, commercial as well as altruistic, as well as preventing

64
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,280
Swedish citizens from going overseas to do it.

65
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,460
The argument about women being exploited applies only to commercial surrogacy.

66
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,260
So why do they also reject altruistic surrogacy?

67
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,780
The report stated that it's unreasonable for women to sign away the rights to a baby she

68
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,740
doesn't even know or seen yet.

69
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,220
But fair enough, there are many cases of surrogate mothers who, after having given

70
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,660
birth, desperately want to renege on the agreement and keep the kid.

71
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,700
The other side of the argument, though, is that the report seems to imply that women

72
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,500
who choose to be surrogates aren't really capable of deciding these sorts of bodily

73
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,820
autonomy questions for themselves, which also just isn't true.

74
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,060
The next argument is that it's because the parents are gay and therefore this is immoral.

75
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,860
The quartering said in a reply to straight couples using surrogacy as an option, I tolerate

76
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,380
that because at least the baby has a mother and father.

77
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,060
I still detest how rich straight couples use it, Hollywood, etc.

78
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,020
This is an extension of the all surrogacy is wrong argument because kids should know

79
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,460
their actual parents.

80
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,820
But it's especially wrong for gay people to do it because the kid wouldn't even have

81
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,660
a parent of the other sex.

82
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,780
Of course, this is also an argument against adoption, because adopted kids don't know

83
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,020
their parents either.

84
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,740
And in its most extreme form, this logic leads to kids remaining with clearly unfit parents

85
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,380
because they are their parents.

86
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,500
Of course, the quartering didn't say that, but that is where the logic naturally leads

87
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,680
once developed.

88
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,520
The third argument is that gay parents abuse their children at higher rates.

89
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,380
A few stories of this actually happening began to circulate during this time.

90
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,720
One where a gay couple sexually abused their adopted sons while also pimping them out to

91
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,840
other men.

92
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Another where a gay couple hired a Russian surrogate to carry their child, only to immediately

93
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,040
begin recording themselves sexually abusing the baby and sharing the video on the dark

94
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
web.

95
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,160
The police uncovered evidence that this was their sole reason for obtaining the child.

96
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,720
The first two arguments were moral ones, on which there is significant disagreement from

97
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
the get-go.

98
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,580
The first one, that surrogacy is child trafficking because you're buying a child, is frankly

99
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,920
a matter of interpretation.

100
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,900
I personally feel like commercial surrogacy skirts the line a bit too close for my comfort,

101
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,880
but the people who voluntarily do it out of the goodness of their hearts, that's their

102
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,320
choice and not yours.

103
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,320
The second one, that surrogacy takes kids away from their real parents, while true,

104
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
isn't necessarily indicative of any wrongdoing.

105
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,080
We take kids away from their parents all the time, when the parents are bad.

106
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,880
Parents also give up their kids for adoption all the time as well.

107
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,320
Should both of these things stop?

108
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,520
I don't think so.

109
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,800
To me, the second argument just isn't persuasive, especially if the surrogate parents aren't

110
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,700
actually abusing their kids.

111
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,560
Which then leads us to the third argument, what if they are?

112
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,640
Or more generally, what if gay parents are actually just naturally worse at being parents,

113
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,680
whether that's because they have a higher chance of abusing their kids, or because kids

114
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,160
miss out on having a parent of either sex around, or any other factor?

115
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,600
Well that's a data argument, not a moral one, and we do have data to look at.

116
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,440
Now progressives generally don't like looking at the data on this topic, because, uh, spoilers,

117
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,800
it doesn't look that good for the gays, and in fact, they tend to call you a bigot

118
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,640
or a Nazi if you dare to examine what's actually happening here.

119
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,220
But we can be a bit more intellectually honest than they are.

120
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:48,760
A study in 2005 examined child molestation by gay parents in Illinois from 1997 to 2002,

121
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,080
and found that 34% of the parents of foster kids or adopted kids homosexually abused those

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,040
parents, meaning mothers sexually abusing daughters and fathers sexually abusing sons.

123
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,000
It doesn't say how many of those abusers were in straight or gay relationships, though,

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,320
and it is conceivable that an abuser who is nominally straight still sexually abuses a

125
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,960
child of the same sex out of a power-based desire, not a homosexual one.

126
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,560
Another study, also from 2005, examined cases of child sexual abuse by foster parents reported

127
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,920
in the news from 1980 to 2003.

128
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,320
The cases in which the abuse was homosexual was extremely disproportionate to the actual

129
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,520
gay population, and the vast majority of abusers were men.

130
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,000
It's not just abuse, though.

131
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,040
A 2013 study showed that the children of gay couples were less likely to graduate high

132
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
school.

133
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,320
A 1996 study in Australia showed that both success in school and social development were

134
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,800
highest among kids of married straight couples, lower among cohabitating straight couples,

135
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,200
and lowest among gay couples.

136
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,420
There's similar results from two 2012 studies regarding the kids of gay relationships and

137
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,680
school success.

138
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,380
A 2009 study showed that the adult children of gay couples have a harder time with intimacy,

139
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,140
trust, and the ability to build relationships.

140
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,080
Another 2012 study showed that the adult children of gay couples suffered from a broad range

141
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,940
of emotional and social problems.

142
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,020
A 2013 study, not about kids raised by gay couples specifically, but about kids of surrogacy

143
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,560
in general, showed adjustment difficulties throughout youth and puberty of the kids who

144
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,860
knew that they were a product of surrogacy.

145
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:21,420
And a 2015 study found that after controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic

146
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,220
status, the children of gay couples were more than twice as likely to have ADHD than the

147
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,060
children of straight couples.

148
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,280
So far, it seems like the idea that gay people are just like straight people and just as

149
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,780
capable of raising children might not be accurate.

150
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,580
And the progressive reply to this data seems to be to just ignore it for ideological reasons.

151
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,100
But there is a silver lining.

152
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,260
A study out of the Netherlands shows that after adjusting for cultural stressors associated

153
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,320
with being gay, there are no significant disadvantages between kids of gay parents and kids of straight

154
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
parents.

155
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,700
A 2023 study examining data collected between 2015 and 2022 determined that the mental health

156
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,280
gap between kids of gay couples and kids of straight couples had largely disappeared compared

157
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,580
to earlier studies.

158
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,460
In a 2006 study examining gay marriage showed that when gay couples were married, their

159
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,000
children tended to enjoy the same benefits of marriage that straight children did.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,740
So it might be the case that some of this stuff is social, and we're seeing those problems

161
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,000
slowly alleviate as gay acceptance has increased over time.

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,340
Maybe your knee-jerk response to this is to say, well, those studies are new, they're

163
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,700
obviously biased, we should just ignore them and trust the old ones.

164
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,980
But then you'd be in the exact same camp as the progressives who don't want to look at

165
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,600
the old studies at all, ignoring data for ideological reasons.

166
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,000
The truth seems to be that while there are significant differences between the children

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,460
of straight relationships and the children of gay relationships, the playing field is

168
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,380
leveling out over time, and it's happening as gay acceptance increases.

169
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,680
It's not just that, though, because healthier gay behavior on the part of the parents is

170
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,380
also likely contributing to the alleviation through creating a more stable home situation.

171
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:02,180
A study from 1998 showed that pre-1994 gay men had, on average, a 20-year shorter lifespan,

172
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,220
mainly due to drug use and HIV.

173
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,620
Obviously, the choice to have bug-spreading sex and do drugs constantly is an individual

174
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,620
one.

175
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,280
But where do we pinpoint the source of that behavior?

176
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,240
Are gay men just naturally degenerate since there's no risk of pregnancy with their sexual

177
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
activity?

178
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,960
Is this a product of them being cast out of society and developing an outsider culture

179
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,880
that rejects all things heteronormative, even if it's good for them?

180
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
I don't know.

181
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,560
But if the reduced 20-year lifespan comes from drugs and HIV, and a gay man nowadays

182
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,500
chooses a healthier lifestyle with no drugs and monogamy instead, I can't see this being

183
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,620
applicable to him.

184
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,100
Of course, even now, the popular gay subculture isn't helping things.

185
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,980
The whole monkey pox thing from a couple years ago spread primarily among the gay community

186
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,380
for a reason.

187
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,980
Poppers are well-known in the gay community as the go-to sex drug, and it's like, what

188
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,980
the fuck, dude?

189
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,660
Why are there so many burnouts that a whole-ass sexual orientation has a go-to sex drug?

190
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,620
And when one in eight sexually active gay men in London have HIV, you know that there's

191
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,780
a problem with at least that city's gay nightlife.

192
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,300
Even if gay people can buck the trend of unhealthy behaviors, it seems like a lot of

193
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,300
them aren't.

194
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,460
Or at least, progress in that regard is slow-going.

195
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,040
And as long as these problems are present, the people who have those problems just are

196
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,420
not parent material.

197
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,700
It's not clear what the root cause is, though.

198
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,740
It is true that gay people tend to have more abusive parents.

199
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,900
But does the abuse make them gay, or are they being abused for coming out as gay?

200
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,900
That I doesn't say.

201
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,040
Do gay men behave this self-destructively due to living in a homophobic society?

202
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,200
Is the gay subculture overly sexual and degenerate as a defense mechanism?

203
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,400
Are gay people just overly sexual and degenerate themselves?

204
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,520
Do the kids of gay couples experience their issues because they lack a parent of the other

205
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,040
sex to properly model?

206
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,460
Or is it because gay parents are simply more dysfunctional individuals than straight ones,

207
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,280
due to any of these reasons?

208
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,160
I personally wouldn't be surprised if, in a perfectly inclusive society, with everyone

209
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,880
being ideal parents, with none of these social problems, straight couples were still just

210
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,280
better for kids than gay couples, at least a tiny bit.

211
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,640
Some of these problems that the kids experience are likely just endemic to having gay parents,

212
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,600
probably regarding the modeling stuff.

213
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,200
But considering that the huge gap between them is closing, as both society becomes more

214
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,000
inclusive of gay parents, and as gay people themselves stop acting like degenerates, I

215
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,920
think way more of the problem is not just endemic to being gay.

216
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,180
The gay inclusive conservatives of 10 years ago, rest in peace, were probably correct

217
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,020
when they said that the gay community is made better by their inclusion in married

218
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,020
life.

219
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,820
Now, those high-profile sexual exploitation cases are still very serious, and we can't

220
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,100
simply hand-wave away the data showing that gay men are more likely to sexually abuse

221
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
their kids.

222
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,780
Crying about homophobia and bigotry doesn't refute the numbers, and it certainly doesn't

223
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,780
make the lives of those child victims any better.

224
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,400
But obviously, not all gay people do this.

225
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,140
And more importantly, we wouldn't use this logic to blanket restrict any other demographic's

226
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,380
ability to adopt or foster or get a surrogate to carry their child.

227
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,780
For example, a step-parent is way more likely to abuse a child than a gay parent is.

228
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,220
And yet, we still allow good step-parents to adopt their partner's children.

229
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,300
And when possible, we try to protect children from bad step-parents.

230
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,700
We're not that successful at it right now, yeah, but we don't use the prevalence of

231
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,320
step-parent abuse to justify barring step-parents from adopting kids.

232
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,420
We take an individualist approach.

233
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,860
The good ones should be free to live their lives unimpeded, and the bad ones should be

234
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,060
apprehended and brought to justice.

235
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,880
Why wouldn't we use the same logic for gay parents?

236
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,580
It would not be justified to take the children away from a good gay couple because of the

237
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,980
actions of high-profile bad gay couples.

238
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,020
And this is the main reason why I reject the arguments of the quartering and the others

239
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,280
on this topic.

240
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,440
Liberal individualism is, once again, the answer.

241
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,520
Even if gay parents are less likely to be good parents based on the data, individuals

242
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,060
buck trends all the time.

243
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,280
Good gay parents can exist, they do exist, obviously, and they shouldn't be restricted

244
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,020
just because other bad ones also exist.

245
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:54,020
The other complaints about how is child trafficking or whatever, they just don't stand up to

246
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,020
scrutiny in my view.

247
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,020
How about this?

248
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,640
If you're a right-winger and watching this and you disagree with my take, you think that

249
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,780
the gays are just super dangerous to kids, you've seen those terrible news headlines

250
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,640
with your own eyes and you can't be convinced otherwise.

251
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,260
Let me put it this way.

252
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,680
Those stories make the news in the first place because they're unusual.

253
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,600
The news generally doesn't report on things that regularly happen.

254
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,920
That's your logic on why the news have stopped reporting on when black people commit crime,

255
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
right?
