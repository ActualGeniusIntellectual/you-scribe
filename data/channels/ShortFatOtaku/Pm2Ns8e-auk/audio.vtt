00:00.000 --> 00:10.660
There's been a slow burn regarding the right wing and the general acceptance of gay people.

00:10.660 --> 00:14.600
In the early 2010s, it felt like the age of the religious right was over.

00:14.600 --> 00:19.120
People were generally okay with gays and lesbians being around invisible in society.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.880
Gay marriage had arrived to the West, and seemed to be going okay, and some conservatives

00:22.880 --> 00:27.480
understood that monogamy could be the glue that keeps a gay couple together and away

00:27.480 --> 00:32.280
from what was frankly pretty self-destructive behavior that gay people were known for in

00:32.280 --> 00:35.720
the 70s and 80s, just as it had done for straight couples.

00:35.720 --> 00:40.840
In fact, the right wing argument against immigration from a decade ago was that if, for example,

00:40.840 --> 00:44.900
a Western nation became a majority Muslim one, all of those gay rights that we as a

00:44.900 --> 00:49.440
liberal society value would be rolled back due to the growing religious extremism.

00:49.440 --> 00:54.360
It was surprising for me, yet welcome, to see the new young crop of right wingers begin

00:54.360 --> 00:56.280
to adopt these positions.

00:56.280 --> 01:00.500
But unfortunately, I think the right wing is shifting back into the old mold.

01:00.500 --> 01:05.080
It started with more extreme elements, saying that traditional society is based, actually,

01:05.080 --> 01:09.920
and that Russian orthodoxy or Muslim fundamentalism were finally pushing back against the degenerate

01:09.920 --> 01:11.520
atheistic liberal world.

01:11.520 --> 01:17.480
Now, part of this shift was absolutely spurred on by the growing politicization of the LGBTQ

01:17.480 --> 01:20.080
movement after gay marriage was achieved in America.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.640
The argument before gay marriage was equal rights, and that was a good argument.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.680
It meant integration into liberal society.

01:25.680 --> 01:29.700
But that isn't the way the activists think anymore, much to the chagrin of older gay

01:29.700 --> 01:32.720
and trans people who, frankly, just want to be left alone.

01:32.720 --> 01:36.800
But a few weeks ago, I saw people who I generally view to be reasonable, on the right, take

01:36.800 --> 01:39.320
up positions that I never thought would make a return.

01:39.320 --> 01:43.200
I know Jeremy, the quartering, to personally be an agreeable guy, but I can't agree with

01:43.200 --> 01:44.200
him here.

01:44.200 --> 01:49.440
Dave Rubin, Pete Buttigieg, Shane Dawson, rich gay men who use their status to purchase

01:49.440 --> 01:51.920
babies as props for internet clout.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.440
All three rush to post their purchases to socials moments after being ripped from their

01:56.440 --> 01:57.440
birth mothers.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.880
It's disgusting, and I'm tired of pretending it's not.

01:59.880 --> 02:03.720
What the quartering is talking about here is the successful surrogacies of these three

02:03.720 --> 02:05.520
high-profile gay men.

02:05.520 --> 02:09.940
All of them are following the path that was laid out for them a decade ago for gay acceptance.

02:09.940 --> 02:13.080
Stop having promiscuous sex and emulate heterosexual couples.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.560
Monogamous married life, have a productive job, house, and kids.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.640
Try to be a positive part of the community.

02:18.640 --> 02:22.440
But now the complaint is that because these gay men wanted to have children that they

02:22.440 --> 02:25.680
were biologically related to, and therefore they had the kids through surrogacy, where

02:25.680 --> 02:29.680
a woman agrees to carry the child for them, that this was somehow immoral.

02:29.680 --> 02:33.400
And while it wasn't just the quartering who jumped in on this conversation, he was probably

02:33.400 --> 02:35.880
the most high-profile person involved in it.

02:35.880 --> 02:39.880
He posted this picture of one of the men holding their newborn in what appears to be a hospital

02:39.880 --> 02:43.800
setting, with the caption, this poor child is likely trying to latch to his mother's

02:43.800 --> 02:49.240
breast for life-sustaining milk, but instead gets a weird mouthful of gay man chest hair

02:49.240 --> 02:52.000
who bought the thing and likely thinks it feels weird.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.320
This is fucking unhinged dude, he's just holding a baby.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.600
When it was pointed out that the picture doesn't actually show the baby trying to suckle at

02:58.600 --> 03:03.000
his breast Peter Griffin style, the quartering replied with, children are not accessories

03:03.000 --> 03:07.640
and shouldn't be grown in a lab for weirdos to post pictures online larping as a mom or

03:07.640 --> 03:08.640
dad.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.100
So let's look at their arguments.

03:10.100 --> 03:14.340
Some of them are saying that it's human trafficking, that because surrogates generally get paid

03:14.340 --> 03:18.940
in exchange for giving up their time and energy and body for nine months, the couple is buying

03:18.940 --> 03:22.500
a baby, they're buying another human, and that the woman themselves only agreed to do

03:22.500 --> 03:26.740
it because they're poor, making it exploitative in the same way that prostitution is.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.660
But this doesn't seem to be the case, at least in the States.

03:29.660 --> 03:33.360
Most women who agree to be surrogates tend to be middle-class, married, and Christian,

03:33.360 --> 03:37.520
who report enjoying the feeling of being pregnant and wanting to help others who can't have

03:37.520 --> 03:38.780
kids of their own.

03:38.780 --> 03:43.380
Nonetheless, this view of surrogacy as inherently exploitative isn't a fringe one.

03:43.380 --> 03:47.780
For example, back in 2016, Sweden's parliament published an inquiry into surrogacy, recommending

03:47.780 --> 03:51.700
that the country ban all of it, commercial as well as altruistic, as well as preventing

03:51.700 --> 03:54.280
Swedish citizens from going overseas to do it.

03:54.280 --> 03:58.460
The argument about women being exploited applies only to commercial surrogacy.

03:58.460 --> 04:01.260
So why do they also reject altruistic surrogacy?

04:01.260 --> 04:04.780
The report stated that it's unreasonable for women to sign away the rights to a baby she

04:04.780 --> 04:06.740
doesn't even know or seen yet.

04:06.740 --> 04:10.220
But fair enough, there are many cases of surrogate mothers who, after having given

04:10.220 --> 04:13.660
birth, desperately want to renege on the agreement and keep the kid.

04:13.660 --> 04:16.700
The other side of the argument, though, is that the report seems to imply that women

04:16.700 --> 04:20.500
who choose to be surrogates aren't really capable of deciding these sorts of bodily

04:20.500 --> 04:23.820
autonomy questions for themselves, which also just isn't true.

04:23.820 --> 04:28.060
The next argument is that it's because the parents are gay and therefore this is immoral.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.860
The quartering said in a reply to straight couples using surrogacy as an option, I tolerate

04:31.860 --> 04:34.380
that because at least the baby has a mother and father.

04:34.380 --> 04:38.060
I still detest how rich straight couples use it, Hollywood, etc.

04:38.060 --> 04:42.020
This is an extension of the all surrogacy is wrong argument because kids should know

04:42.020 --> 04:43.460
their actual parents.

04:43.460 --> 04:46.820
But it's especially wrong for gay people to do it because the kid wouldn't even have

04:46.820 --> 04:48.660
a parent of the other sex.

04:48.660 --> 04:51.780
Of course, this is also an argument against adoption, because adopted kids don't know

04:51.780 --> 04:53.020
their parents either.

04:53.020 --> 04:57.740
And in its most extreme form, this logic leads to kids remaining with clearly unfit parents

04:57.740 --> 04:59.380
because they are their parents.

04:59.380 --> 05:02.500
Of course, the quartering didn't say that, but that is where the logic naturally leads

05:02.500 --> 05:03.680
once developed.

05:03.680 --> 05:07.520
The third argument is that gay parents abuse their children at higher rates.

05:07.520 --> 05:11.380
A few stories of this actually happening began to circulate during this time.

05:11.380 --> 05:15.720
One where a gay couple sexually abused their adopted sons while also pimping them out to

05:15.720 --> 05:16.840
other men.

05:16.840 --> 05:20.840
Another where a gay couple hired a Russian surrogate to carry their child, only to immediately

05:20.840 --> 05:25.040
begin recording themselves sexually abusing the baby and sharing the video on the dark

05:25.040 --> 05:26.040
web.

05:26.040 --> 05:30.160
The police uncovered evidence that this was their sole reason for obtaining the child.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.720
The first two arguments were moral ones, on which there is significant disagreement from

05:33.720 --> 05:34.720
the get-go.

05:34.720 --> 05:38.580
The first one, that surrogacy is child trafficking because you're buying a child, is frankly

05:38.580 --> 05:39.920
a matter of interpretation.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.900
I personally feel like commercial surrogacy skirts the line a bit too close for my comfort,

05:43.900 --> 05:46.880
but the people who voluntarily do it out of the goodness of their hearts, that's their

05:46.880 --> 05:48.320
choice and not yours.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.320
The second one, that surrogacy takes kids away from their real parents, while true,

05:52.320 --> 05:54.560
isn't necessarily indicative of any wrongdoing.

05:54.560 --> 05:58.080
We take kids away from their parents all the time, when the parents are bad.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.880
Parents also give up their kids for adoption all the time as well.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.320
Should both of these things stop?

06:02.320 --> 06:03.520
I don't think so.

06:03.520 --> 06:07.800
To me, the second argument just isn't persuasive, especially if the surrogate parents aren't

06:07.800 --> 06:09.700
actually abusing their kids.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.560
Which then leads us to the third argument, what if they are?

06:12.560 --> 06:16.640
Or more generally, what if gay parents are actually just naturally worse at being parents,

06:16.640 --> 06:19.680
whether that's because they have a higher chance of abusing their kids, or because kids

06:19.680 --> 06:23.160
miss out on having a parent of either sex around, or any other factor?

06:23.160 --> 06:26.600
Well that's a data argument, not a moral one, and we do have data to look at.

06:26.600 --> 06:31.440
Now progressives generally don't like looking at the data on this topic, because, uh, spoilers,

06:31.440 --> 06:35.800
it doesn't look that good for the gays, and in fact, they tend to call you a bigot

06:35.800 --> 06:39.640
or a Nazi if you dare to examine what's actually happening here.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.220
But we can be a bit more intellectually honest than they are.

06:42.220 --> 06:48.760
A study in 2005 examined child molestation by gay parents in Illinois from 1997 to 2002,

06:48.760 --> 06:54.080
and found that 34% of the parents of foster kids or adopted kids homosexually abused those

06:54.080 --> 06:58.040
parents, meaning mothers sexually abusing daughters and fathers sexually abusing sons.

06:58.040 --> 07:02.000
It doesn't say how many of those abusers were in straight or gay relationships, though,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.320
and it is conceivable that an abuser who is nominally straight still sexually abuses a

07:06.320 --> 07:10.960
child of the same sex out of a power-based desire, not a homosexual one.

07:10.960 --> 07:16.560
Another study, also from 2005, examined cases of child sexual abuse by foster parents reported

07:16.560 --> 07:19.920
in the news from 1980 to 2003.

07:19.920 --> 07:24.320
The cases in which the abuse was homosexual was extremely disproportionate to the actual

07:24.320 --> 07:27.520
gay population, and the vast majority of abusers were men.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.000
It's not just abuse, though.

07:29.000 --> 07:33.040
A 2013 study showed that the children of gay couples were less likely to graduate high

07:33.040 --> 07:34.040
school.

07:34.040 --> 07:38.320
A 1996 study in Australia showed that both success in school and social development were

07:38.320 --> 07:42.800
highest among kids of married straight couples, lower among cohabitating straight couples,

07:42.800 --> 07:44.200
and lowest among gay couples.

07:44.200 --> 07:49.420
There's similar results from two 2012 studies regarding the kids of gay relationships and

07:49.420 --> 07:50.680
school success.

07:50.680 --> 07:55.380
A 2009 study showed that the adult children of gay couples have a harder time with intimacy,

07:55.380 --> 07:58.140
trust, and the ability to build relationships.

07:58.140 --> 08:02.080
Another 2012 study showed that the adult children of gay couples suffered from a broad range

08:02.080 --> 08:03.940
of emotional and social problems.

08:03.940 --> 08:09.020
A 2013 study, not about kids raised by gay couples specifically, but about kids of surrogacy

08:09.020 --> 08:13.560
in general, showed adjustment difficulties throughout youth and puberty of the kids who

08:13.560 --> 08:15.860
knew that they were a product of surrogacy.

08:15.860 --> 08:21.420
And a 2015 study found that after controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic

08:21.420 --> 08:26.220
status, the children of gay couples were more than twice as likely to have ADHD than the

08:26.220 --> 08:28.060
children of straight couples.

08:28.060 --> 08:32.280
So far, it seems like the idea that gay people are just like straight people and just as

08:32.280 --> 08:34.780
capable of raising children might not be accurate.

08:34.780 --> 08:40.580
And the progressive reply to this data seems to be to just ignore it for ideological reasons.

08:40.580 --> 08:42.100
But there is a silver lining.

08:42.140 --> 08:46.260
A study out of the Netherlands shows that after adjusting for cultural stressors associated

08:46.260 --> 08:51.320
with being gay, there are no significant disadvantages between kids of gay parents and kids of straight

08:51.320 --> 08:52.320
parents.

08:52.320 --> 08:57.700
A 2023 study examining data collected between 2015 and 2022 determined that the mental health

08:57.700 --> 09:02.280
gap between kids of gay couples and kids of straight couples had largely disappeared compared

09:02.280 --> 09:03.580
to earlier studies.

09:03.580 --> 09:08.460
In a 2006 study examining gay marriage showed that when gay couples were married, their

09:08.460 --> 09:13.000
children tended to enjoy the same benefits of marriage that straight children did.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.740
So it might be the case that some of this stuff is social, and we're seeing those problems

09:16.740 --> 09:20.000
slowly alleviate as gay acceptance has increased over time.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.340
Maybe your knee-jerk response to this is to say, well, those studies are new, they're

09:23.340 --> 09:26.700
obviously biased, we should just ignore them and trust the old ones.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.980
But then you'd be in the exact same camp as the progressives who don't want to look at

09:29.980 --> 09:33.600
the old studies at all, ignoring data for ideological reasons.

09:33.600 --> 09:38.000
The truth seems to be that while there are significant differences between the children

09:38.000 --> 09:42.460
of straight relationships and the children of gay relationships, the playing field is

09:42.460 --> 09:46.380
leveling out over time, and it's happening as gay acceptance increases.

09:46.380 --> 09:50.680
It's not just that, though, because healthier gay behavior on the part of the parents is

09:50.680 --> 09:55.380
also likely contributing to the alleviation through creating a more stable home situation.

09:55.380 --> 10:02.180
A study from 1998 showed that pre-1994 gay men had, on average, a 20-year shorter lifespan,

10:02.180 --> 10:04.220
mainly due to drug use and HIV.

10:04.440 --> 10:08.620
Obviously, the choice to have bug-spreading sex and do drugs constantly is an individual

10:08.620 --> 10:09.620
one.

10:09.620 --> 10:11.280
But where do we pinpoint the source of that behavior?

10:11.280 --> 10:15.240
Are gay men just naturally degenerate since there's no risk of pregnancy with their sexual

10:15.240 --> 10:16.240
activity?

10:16.240 --> 10:19.960
Is this a product of them being cast out of society and developing an outsider culture

10:19.960 --> 10:23.880
that rejects all things heteronormative, even if it's good for them?

10:23.880 --> 10:24.880
I don't know.

10:24.880 --> 10:29.560
But if the reduced 20-year lifespan comes from drugs and HIV, and a gay man nowadays

10:29.560 --> 10:33.500
chooses a healthier lifestyle with no drugs and monogamy instead, I can't see this being

10:33.500 --> 10:34.620
applicable to him.

10:34.620 --> 10:38.100
Of course, even now, the popular gay subculture isn't helping things.

10:38.100 --> 10:41.980
The whole monkey pox thing from a couple years ago spread primarily among the gay community

10:41.980 --> 10:43.380
for a reason.

10:43.380 --> 10:46.980
Poppers are well-known in the gay community as the go-to sex drug, and it's like, what

10:46.980 --> 10:47.980
the fuck, dude?

10:47.980 --> 10:52.660
Why are there so many burnouts that a whole-ass sexual orientation has a go-to sex drug?

10:52.660 --> 10:56.620
And when one in eight sexually active gay men in London have HIV, you know that there's

10:56.620 --> 10:59.780
a problem with at least that city's gay nightlife.

10:59.780 --> 11:04.300
Even if gay people can buck the trend of unhealthy behaviors, it seems like a lot of

11:04.300 --> 11:05.300
them aren't.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.460
Or at least, progress in that regard is slow-going.

11:07.460 --> 11:11.040
And as long as these problems are present, the people who have those problems just are

11:11.040 --> 11:12.420
not parent material.

11:12.420 --> 11:14.700
It's not clear what the root cause is, though.

11:14.700 --> 11:17.740
It is true that gay people tend to have more abusive parents.

11:17.740 --> 11:21.900
But does the abuse make them gay, or are they being abused for coming out as gay?

11:21.900 --> 11:22.900
That I doesn't say.

11:22.900 --> 11:27.040
Do gay men behave this self-destructively due to living in a homophobic society?

11:27.040 --> 11:31.200
Is the gay subculture overly sexual and degenerate as a defense mechanism?

11:31.200 --> 11:34.400
Are gay people just overly sexual and degenerate themselves?

11:34.400 --> 11:38.520
Do the kids of gay couples experience their issues because they lack a parent of the other

11:38.520 --> 11:40.040
sex to properly model?

11:40.040 --> 11:44.460
Or is it because gay parents are simply more dysfunctional individuals than straight ones,

11:44.460 --> 11:46.280
due to any of these reasons?

11:46.280 --> 11:51.160
I personally wouldn't be surprised if, in a perfectly inclusive society, with everyone

11:51.160 --> 11:55.880
being ideal parents, with none of these social problems, straight couples were still just

11:55.880 --> 11:59.280
better for kids than gay couples, at least a tiny bit.

11:59.280 --> 12:03.640
Some of these problems that the kids experience are likely just endemic to having gay parents,

12:03.640 --> 12:05.600
probably regarding the modeling stuff.

12:05.600 --> 12:10.200
But considering that the huge gap between them is closing, as both society becomes more

12:10.200 --> 12:15.000
inclusive of gay parents, and as gay people themselves stop acting like degenerates, I

12:15.000 --> 12:18.920
think way more of the problem is not just endemic to being gay.

12:18.920 --> 12:23.180
The gay inclusive conservatives of 10 years ago, rest in peace, were probably correct

12:23.180 --> 12:27.020
when they said that the gay community is made better by their inclusion in married

12:27.020 --> 12:28.020
life.

12:28.020 --> 12:32.820
Now, those high-profile sexual exploitation cases are still very serious, and we can't

12:32.820 --> 12:37.100
simply hand-wave away the data showing that gay men are more likely to sexually abuse

12:37.100 --> 12:38.100
their kids.

12:38.100 --> 12:41.780
Crying about homophobia and bigotry doesn't refute the numbers, and it certainly doesn't

12:41.780 --> 12:43.780
make the lives of those child victims any better.

12:43.780 --> 12:46.400
But obviously, not all gay people do this.

12:46.400 --> 12:51.140
And more importantly, we wouldn't use this logic to blanket restrict any other demographic's

12:51.140 --> 12:54.380
ability to adopt or foster or get a surrogate to carry their child.

12:54.380 --> 12:58.780
For example, a step-parent is way more likely to abuse a child than a gay parent is.

12:58.780 --> 13:02.220
And yet, we still allow good step-parents to adopt their partner's children.

13:02.220 --> 13:05.300
And when possible, we try to protect children from bad step-parents.

13:05.300 --> 13:09.700
We're not that successful at it right now, yeah, but we don't use the prevalence of

13:09.700 --> 13:14.320
step-parent abuse to justify barring step-parents from adopting kids.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.420
We take an individualist approach.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.860
The good ones should be free to live their lives unimpeded, and the bad ones should be

13:19.860 --> 13:22.060
apprehended and brought to justice.

13:22.060 --> 13:24.880
Why wouldn't we use the same logic for gay parents?

13:24.880 --> 13:28.580
It would not be justified to take the children away from a good gay couple because of the

13:28.580 --> 13:30.980
actions of high-profile bad gay couples.

13:30.980 --> 13:34.020
And this is the main reason why I reject the arguments of the quartering and the others

13:34.020 --> 13:35.280
on this topic.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.440
Liberal individualism is, once again, the answer.

13:38.440 --> 13:42.520
Even if gay parents are less likely to be good parents based on the data, individuals

13:42.520 --> 13:44.060
buck trends all the time.

13:44.060 --> 13:48.280
Good gay parents can exist, they do exist, obviously, and they shouldn't be restricted

13:48.280 --> 13:51.020
just because other bad ones also exist.

13:51.020 --> 13:54.020
The other complaints about how is child trafficking or whatever, they just don't stand up to

13:54.020 --> 13:55.020
scrutiny in my view.

13:55.020 --> 13:56.020
How about this?

13:56.020 --> 13:58.640
If you're a right-winger and watching this and you disagree with my take, you think that

13:58.640 --> 14:01.780
the gays are just super dangerous to kids, you've seen those terrible news headlines

14:01.780 --> 14:03.640
with your own eyes and you can't be convinced otherwise.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.260
Let me put it this way.

14:05.260 --> 14:08.680
Those stories make the news in the first place because they're unusual.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.600
The news generally doesn't report on things that regularly happen.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.920
That's your logic on why the news have stopped reporting on when black people commit crime,

14:14.920 --> 14:15.920
right?
