00:00.000 --> 00:08.540
I, once again, have no time today.

00:08.540 --> 00:13.100
I spent a good chunk of the day doing prep for my appearance on Adam and Sitch tomorrow.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.280
Check that out, by the way.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.820
And so very little time in terms of writing or anything like that.

00:17.820 --> 00:24.480
Which means we're reacting to more woke nonsense because that's the easiest type of video I

00:24.480 --> 00:26.120
can create right now.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.240
That's just how it is, guys.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.800
And hey, it makes for good repackaging into shorts later, so that's also pretty good.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.360
Let's get our coffees, let's wrap ourselves in our blankets, and have a good laugh at

00:35.360 --> 00:38.360
what I've dredged up from the anals of the internet today.

00:38.360 --> 00:43.020
A friendly reminder to all the cis out there, just because it's called preferred name and

00:43.020 --> 00:45.520
preferred pronoun, that does not make it optional.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.760
And if you have trouble accepting that, then maybe instead you can accept my size 13 steel

00:49.760 --> 00:51.120
toe on your trachea.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.120
We could start there if you prefer.

00:53.120 --> 00:56.600
Alright, dude, let's give it a go.

00:56.600 --> 01:00.720
Which reminds me of that one video last time where the person said that my pronouns are

01:00.720 --> 01:01.720
not optional.

01:01.720 --> 01:05.040
You have to use them, and it's like, alright, at least you're open and on the table about

01:05.040 --> 01:06.040
it.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.040
These people can't fight to save their fucking lives.

01:07.040 --> 01:11.760
But like, imagine the fucking hubris you have to have to be like this.

01:11.760 --> 01:14.200
This is how you will address me when I'm not in the room.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.320
It's like, Jesus Christ, dictators do that shit.

01:17.320 --> 01:28.560
Listen, listen, you're not getting a robot vagina installed or anything.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.600
You know, it's not like there's gonna be you know, pistons or hydraulic pressure that's

01:31.600 --> 01:34.040
just gonna, you know, suck some guy's foreskin off.

01:34.040 --> 01:36.800
That is not how trans vaginas work.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.800
All right.

01:37.800 --> 01:38.800
Oh, God, this one's from itsagundam.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.140
All right, let's check it out.

01:40.140 --> 01:43.640
This guy has been sending me Goodnight Queen every single night since May.

01:43.640 --> 01:46.500
Anything a guy does for you, he's doing for other girls, and thank you to this man for

01:46.500 --> 01:47.500
proving me right.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.500
Look at this.

01:48.500 --> 01:49.500
Look at this.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.500
Started in May.

01:50.500 --> 01:51.500
Started in May.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.660
So I have bad news for you ladies, the account that's sending you Goodnight messages is not

01:55.660 --> 01:56.660
a real account.

01:56.660 --> 02:01.180
In early May, I built an Instagram bot that would send these messages to a group of popular

02:01.180 --> 02:06.020
creators to measure the impact of artificially boosting their egos.

02:06.020 --> 02:11.220
My plan was to start in May and send Goodnight to single large popular creators, and then

02:11.220 --> 02:14.580
stop the messaging around December 23rd.

02:14.580 --> 02:18.580
Which is right in the midst of a holiday season and the most loneliest time for a single person.

02:18.580 --> 02:23.260
And I was going to demonstrate how much random people have said to a very popular creator

02:23.260 --> 02:27.860
whose entire self-worth is based upon the validation and appraisal of others.

02:27.860 --> 02:31.660
If I don't get a Goodnight Queen, it like hurts my feelings, and I love this.

02:31.660 --> 02:32.660
And my hypothesis was correct.

02:32.660 --> 02:33.660
These women said they missed the Goodnight messages.

02:33.660 --> 02:36.660
They were attached to it.

02:36.660 --> 02:37.660
Wow.

02:37.660 --> 02:41.860
Someone called this video, some men just want to watch e-girls burn.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.780
And yeah, I fucking think so.

02:43.780 --> 02:49.780
Hey, I got some fucking Dove men's soap for you too.

02:49.780 --> 02:51.780
Get some of that men's soap on your body.

02:51.780 --> 02:56.780
Cause you smell like shit too.

02:56.780 --> 02:58.780
And you're a man.

02:58.780 --> 03:00.780
I'm not.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.780
I'm not.

03:02.780 --> 03:08.260
Okay, there's no way that this isn't fake.

03:08.260 --> 03:11.940
Like this isn't a trans girl who's actually being abused by her father or something.

03:11.940 --> 03:12.940
This has to be set up.

03:12.940 --> 03:13.940
This looks like a joke.

03:13.940 --> 03:15.420
This looks like it's made to go viral.

03:15.420 --> 03:16.420
It's pretty fucking funny.

03:16.420 --> 03:18.100
I hope people aren't actually taking this seriously.

03:18.100 --> 03:22.100
Ah, this looks like one of those, you know, fresh and fit styled red pill podcasts.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.100
Wait a minute.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.060
Look at the reflection on that window in the background.

03:25.060 --> 03:26.060
Is that a microwave?

03:26.060 --> 03:29.060
We asked the ladies to rate themselves on a scale of one to 10.

03:29.060 --> 03:32.060
I'd say I'm a 10.

03:32.060 --> 03:33.060
10.

03:33.060 --> 03:34.060
10.

03:34.060 --> 03:35.060
10.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.060
10.

03:36.060 --> 03:37.060
10.

03:37.060 --> 03:39.180
Send the asteroid.

03:39.180 --> 03:40.180
Y'all are.

03:40.180 --> 03:41.180
Come on.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.180
Tens.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.180
What would you rate yourself?

03:43.180 --> 03:44.180
Brian?

03:44.180 --> 03:45.180
Six.

03:45.180 --> 03:46.180
6.5 on a good day.

03:46.180 --> 03:47.180
Hubris.

03:47.180 --> 03:48.180
Like delusional to rate yourself as a 10.

03:48.180 --> 03:49.180
So y'all are perfect.

03:49.180 --> 03:50.180
Yep.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.180
Perfect.

03:51.180 --> 03:52.180
Yeah.

03:52.180 --> 03:58.300
If you guys are tens, then there's no girl that's better looking than you.

03:58.300 --> 04:00.420
I love all women.

04:00.420 --> 04:01.420
Every girl is a 10.

04:02.420 --> 04:03.420
Every woman's a 10.

04:03.420 --> 04:05.140
This is fucking copium, dude.

04:05.140 --> 04:06.140
Absolutely not.

04:06.140 --> 04:08.180
Hold on.

04:08.180 --> 04:10.220
Every woman's a 10, but not every guy's a 10.

04:10.220 --> 04:11.220
Just because I love women.

04:11.220 --> 04:12.220
I'm going to be honest.

04:12.220 --> 04:15.060
I'm not going to rate you guys, but none of you are a 10.

04:15.060 --> 04:16.060
You just rated us.

04:16.060 --> 04:17.060
That's all right.

04:17.060 --> 04:20.500
No, I'm not going to give you, but none of you are a tens.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.500
That's fine.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.500
Yeah.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.500
We didn't ask.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.340
Oh, we're all tens.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.620
We don't care if guys don't think that we're tens though.

04:27.620 --> 04:28.900
Also, we're all perpetually single.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.500
It's like, holy shit.

04:30.580 --> 04:33.220
All girls can be tens, but all guys can't be tens.

04:33.220 --> 04:34.220
Oh my God.

04:34.220 --> 04:35.220
Guys, guys.

04:35.220 --> 04:40.580
Man, when I talk about being in a stable, steady relationship with Naomi, I feel like

04:40.580 --> 04:44.180
I'm on the last plane out of Afghanistan as it falls to the Taliban.

04:44.180 --> 04:45.180
You know what I mean?

04:45.180 --> 04:46.460
Like, holy shit.

04:46.460 --> 04:51.500
Imagine being a young teenager, a young early 20s guy and dating the next copper woman coming

04:51.500 --> 04:52.500
out right now.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.500
Holy fuck.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.500
These women aren't girl from material.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.300
Guys, I just got back from a hinge date.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.500
Why am I doing this to myself?

05:00.500 --> 05:02.500
So we scheduled to go to dinner.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.500
We are sitting at the restaurant.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.500
Seems very nice.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.500
I'm not a catfish.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.500
Things are going well.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.500
You mean catfish?

05:10.500 --> 05:11.500
And the waitress comes over.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.500
She wants to take her order.

05:13.500 --> 05:17.500
And I said, okay, I'm going to take the branzino.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.500
And he said, I'm going to take the burger.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.500
And the waitress asked him, okay, how do you like your burger?

05:24.500 --> 05:27.500
He said, how do you like this burger?

05:27.500 --> 05:29.500
And do you want some cheese on your burger?

05:29.500 --> 05:33.500
And he asked, is this going to be extra?

05:33.500 --> 05:36.500
And she says, yes, it's $3 extra.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.500
And he said, okay, then never mind.

05:39.500 --> 05:42.500
I'm over there and I'm like, what the actual fuck?

05:42.500 --> 05:44.500
I'm like, okay, I'm hungry.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.500
I'm going to eat my branzino and see what happens.

05:47.500 --> 05:51.500
And he's like, oh, my God, you have to pay extra for everything these days.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.500
And I'm like, yeah, it's New York City.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.500
So I got my branzino.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.500
He got his burger.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.500
We were eating.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.500
My facial expression, guys.

05:59.500 --> 06:04.500
And once I was satisfied, I got up and I was like, I'm going to the restroom for a second.

06:04.500 --> 06:10.500
And I took my purse and I went to the waitress and I was like, hey, I just want to pay the bill.

06:10.500 --> 06:15.500
And I just paid the bill and walked out of the restaurant and I texted him.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.500
So I texted him, the check is taken care of.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.500
We should have gotten the cheese.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.500
And I blocked him.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.500
What?

06:22.500 --> 06:23.500
What?

06:24.500 --> 06:31.500
So I guess she decided that he was beneath her because he didn't want to pay three dollars for cheese and a burger.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.500
Well, my man dodged a bullet and got a free meal.

06:34.500 --> 06:35.500
Jesus Christ.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.500
What the fuck is up with the dating market right now, guys?

06:41.500 --> 06:42.500
What is she doing?

06:44.500 --> 06:46.500
Who's speaking right now?

06:46.500 --> 06:47.500
It's just Trump Tower.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.500
She she sure fucking showed him.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.500
Oh my God.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.500
What?

07:00.500 --> 07:02.500
He's a rapist?

07:10.500 --> 07:11.500
What the fuck?

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
You can't have a gun in an airport, lady.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.500
What?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.500
What did we just watch?

07:24.500 --> 07:26.500
Oh, she's getting arrested.

07:33.500 --> 07:35.500
Is she saying I hate white cocks?

07:35.500 --> 07:36.500
What the fuck?

07:36.500 --> 07:40.500
Like, I swear, we're just watching people go schizophrenic in real fucking time.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.500
No offense to all my schizophrenic friends out there.

07:42.500 --> 07:43.500
You guys are great.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.500
Just don't do this, OK?

07:45.500 --> 07:50.500
Oh, she's stealing the TV.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.500
Someone lost their cart and someone's stealing the TV out of it.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.500
You're moving too slow.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.500
Jesus.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.500
Fucking Walmarts in Chicago, guys.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.500
Oh, she just fell out the car.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
Oh, Lord.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.500
What the fuck?

08:20.500 --> 08:21.500
Did she leave her...

08:21.500 --> 08:22.500
She left her shoe.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.500
She left her fucking shoe.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.500
She left my shoe.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.500
Oh my fucking God.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.500
Like, this can't keep going on, right?

08:33.500 --> 08:34.500
This can't keep happening.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.500
It's not just that they're stealing from stores now.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.500
People are now stealing from each other.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.500
Some places in America are getting to be so low trust,

08:41.500 --> 08:44.500
you can't even have any kind of cohesive social fabric.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.500
Jesus Christ, guys, if you're an American living in the city,

08:46.500 --> 08:47.500
get the fuck out of there, man.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.500
I don't know what else to tell you.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.500
Shit.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.500
Oh, and speaking of cities, check this one out.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.500
God damn it, I got it muted.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.500
I'm not getting fucking copyright struck for that.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.500
Look at this, though.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.500
Just people standing around fucking high.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.500
Jesus.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.500
It looks like we're in an episode of The Walking Dead or something.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.500
There's like shuffling and listless.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.500
What the fuck?

09:10.500 --> 09:12.500
Jesus.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.500
The drug crisis has gotten so bad,

09:14.500 --> 09:18.500
especially in these, you know, very permissive lefty cities.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.500
I know they're doing, oh, the harm reduction thing,

09:20.500 --> 09:21.500
my harm reduction.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.500
Yeah, okay, I understand.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.500
There's at least a little bit of benefit to that.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.500
But you can't be this fucking permissive.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.500
You can't just be completely chill with people getting high in the street

09:28.500 --> 09:31.500
and sitting around and, like, just ruining everything.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.500
And that is what they're doing.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.500
They're ruining the social fabric.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.500
They're ruining the city.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.500
They're leaving needles everywhere.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.500
Sometimes they're becoming violent.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.500
Sometimes they're becoming a nuisance.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.500
It's not good for them.

09:41.500 --> 09:42.500
It's not good for their families.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.500
It's not good for those who depend on them.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
It's not good for society.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.500
This is not, you know,

09:46.500 --> 09:49.500
somebody wants to smoke a little bit of weed after a hard day's work or something.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.500
This is not what this is.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.500
What the fuck, dude?

09:56.500 --> 09:59.500
Okay, the people who send me these fucking videos need to stop with this shit.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.500
I don't even know if I can show this on fucking YouTube.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.500
This Buffalo Bill ass motherfucker.

10:04.500 --> 10:05.500
Jesus Christ.

10:05.500 --> 10:09.500
Okay, I'm gonna watch it without the image just in case something crazy happens.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.500
That's all I could really find.

10:13.500 --> 10:14.500
But...

10:14.500 --> 10:16.500
Never mind, nothing's good in this.

10:16.500 --> 10:17.500
I think, uh...

10:17.500 --> 10:19.500
I think you'll like it.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.500
Hi, my name is Erin.

10:20.500 --> 10:23.500
I use she, her pronouns, and I am this...

10:26.500 --> 10:27.500
Pets are awesome.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
That cat knows what the fuck is up.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.500
Oh boy, here's some more druggy shit.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.500
Let's go.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.500
Jesus.

10:37.500 --> 10:38.500
You suck!

10:38.500 --> 10:39.500
Who the fuck do you want to fight?

10:39.500 --> 10:40.500
What?

10:40.500 --> 10:41.500
What?

10:41.500 --> 10:42.500
What?

10:42.500 --> 10:43.500
What?

10:43.500 --> 10:44.500
What?

10:44.500 --> 10:46.500
I don't know what she's talking to.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.500
50,000.

10:47.500 --> 10:48.500
50,000.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.500
50,000.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.500
50,000.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.500
50,000.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.500
50,000.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.500
50,000.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.500
Okay.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.500
You guys gotta get her out of the fucking store.

11:11.500 --> 11:15.500
I swear to God, at some point, California's just gonna sink right into the fucking ocean,

11:15.500 --> 11:17.500
and I can't believe it has not happened yet.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.500
This is the last video I have.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.500
People keep sending me these so I can react to them,

11:20.500 --> 11:23.500
and I hope this is enough to make at least a 10-minute video for today.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.500
Let's hope, because I haven't been recording that long.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
So let's check it out.

11:27.500 --> 11:32.500
One of my coworkers told me that they were talking to some students in the hallway,

11:32.500 --> 11:38.500
and they asked, the students asked the other teacher if I'm a boy or a girl.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.500
And the teacher was like, does it matter?

11:40.500 --> 11:41.500
She's cool.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.500
She's cool, yeah.

11:42.500 --> 11:47.500
And they were like, no, I just, I just can't figure it out.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.500
It's just so hard.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.500
I can't figure it out.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.500
Wow.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.500
That's the goal.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.500
That's the goal.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.500
That's the goal.

11:57.500 --> 12:01.500
The goal is to confuse students about gender.

12:01.500 --> 12:06.500
We are at the point where things are becoming way more mascot than they've ever been.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.500
So it's not about, you know, accepting trans people.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.500
Oh, you have a biological male who wants to transition into a woman

12:12.500 --> 12:16.500
and decides to be very feminine and passes and takes up the social role

12:16.500 --> 12:18.500
and, you know, fulfills all of society's expectations.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.500
You get like a Blair White type or a Taftage or a Lilith Lovett.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.500
They look very feminine.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.500
It's like, okay, you know what, we can meet you halfway.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.500
That's the polite thing to do in a liberal society.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.500
That's not what this is.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.500
Trans acceptance was never the progressive's goal.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.500
It was always about confusing people.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.500
It was always about indoctrinating people.

12:35.500 --> 12:41.500
And it was always about abolishing gender as one vector of many separate vectors

12:41.500 --> 12:45.500
of revolution against liberal capitalist democracy.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.500
That's the Gramscian view of things.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.500
I know I've been talking about my Antonio Gramscian video for like a week now.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.500
It's coming.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.500
It's coming down the pipe.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.500
Don't worry.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.500
You'll see it soon.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.500
But for at least some of these activists

12:55.500 --> 12:58.500
and at the expense of a lot of trans people,

12:58.500 --> 13:00.500
this is not about trans acceptance.

13:00.500 --> 13:04.500
It is about indoctrination, confusion, and subversion.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.500
All right, that's all I've got for you today.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.500
I hope you enjoyed the video.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.500
If you're watching this on release,

13:09.500 --> 13:12.500
me and my friends are going to be playing some of the new Bayonetta game,

13:12.500 --> 13:13.500
Bayonetta Origins.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.500
We'll be starting the stream pretty much right when this video comes out.

13:15.500 --> 13:18.500
So if you want to keep supporting the channel, come by and say hi.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.500
I'll see you there, guys.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.500
I love you.
