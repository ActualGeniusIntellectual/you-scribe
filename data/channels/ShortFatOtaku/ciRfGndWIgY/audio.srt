1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,540
I, once again, have no time today.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,100
I spent a good chunk of the day doing prep for my appearance on Adam and Sitch tomorrow.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,280
Check that out, by the way.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,820
And so very little time in terms of writing or anything like that.

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,480
Which means we're reacting to more woke nonsense because that's the easiest type of video I

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,120
can create right now.

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,240
That's just how it is, guys.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,800
And hey, it makes for good repackaging into shorts later, so that's also pretty good.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,360
Let's get our coffees, let's wrap ourselves in our blankets, and have a good laugh at

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,360
what I've dredged up from the anals of the internet today.

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,020
A friendly reminder to all the cis out there, just because it's called preferred name and

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,520
preferred pronoun, that does not make it optional.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,760
And if you have trouble accepting that, then maybe instead you can accept my size 13 steel

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,120
toe on your trachea.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,120
We could start there if you prefer.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,600
Alright, dude, let's give it a go.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,720
Which reminds me of that one video last time where the person said that my pronouns are

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
not optional.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,040
You have to use them, and it's like, alright, at least you're open and on the table about

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
it.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
These people can't fight to save their fucking lives.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,760
But like, imagine the fucking hubris you have to have to be like this.

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,200
This is how you will address me when I'm not in the room.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,320
It's like, Jesus Christ, dictators do that shit.

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:28,560
Listen, listen, you're not getting a robot vagina installed or anything.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,600
You know, it's not like there's gonna be you know, pistons or hydraulic pressure that's

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,040
just gonna, you know, suck some guy's foreskin off.

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,800
That is not how trans vaginas work.

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
All right.

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Oh, God, this one's from itsagundam.

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,140
All right, let's check it out.

32
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,640
This guy has been sending me Goodnight Queen every single night since May.

33
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,500
Anything a guy does for you, he's doing for other girls, and thank you to this man for

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
proving me right.

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Look at this.

36
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Look at this.

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Started in May.

38
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Started in May.

39
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,660
So I have bad news for you ladies, the account that's sending you Goodnight messages is not

40
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,660
a real account.

41
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,180
In early May, I built an Instagram bot that would send these messages to a group of popular

42
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,020
creators to measure the impact of artificially boosting their egos.

43
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,220
My plan was to start in May and send Goodnight to single large popular creators, and then

44
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,580
stop the messaging around December 23rd.

45
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,580
Which is right in the midst of a holiday season and the most loneliest time for a single person.

46
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,260
And I was going to demonstrate how much random people have said to a very popular creator

47
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,860
whose entire self-worth is based upon the validation and appraisal of others.

48
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,660
If I don't get a Goodnight Queen, it like hurts my feelings, and I love this.

49
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,660
And my hypothesis was correct.

50
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,660
These women said they missed the Goodnight messages.

51
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,660
They were attached to it.

52
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,660
Wow.

53
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,860
Someone called this video, some men just want to watch e-girls burn.

54
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,780
And yeah, I fucking think so.

55
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,780
Hey, I got some fucking Dove men's soap for you too.

56
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,780
Get some of that men's soap on your body.

57
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,780
Cause you smell like shit too.

58
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,780
And you're a man.

59
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm not.

60
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,780
I'm not.

61
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,260
Okay, there's no way that this isn't fake.

62
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,940
Like this isn't a trans girl who's actually being abused by her father or something.

63
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,940
This has to be set up.

64
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,940
This looks like a joke.

65
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,420
This looks like it's made to go viral.

66
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,420
It's pretty fucking funny.

67
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,100
I hope people aren't actually taking this seriously.

68
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,100
Ah, this looks like one of those, you know, fresh and fit styled red pill podcasts.

69
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,100
Wait a minute.

70
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,060
Look at the reflection on that window in the background.

71
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,060
Is that a microwave?

72
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,060
We asked the ladies to rate themselves on a scale of one to 10.

73
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,060
I'd say I'm a 10.

74
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,060
10.

75
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,060
10.

76
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,060
10.

77
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,060
10.

78
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,060
10.

79
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,180
Send the asteroid.

80
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,180
Y'all are.

81
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,180
Come on.

82
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,180
Tens.

83
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,180
What would you rate yourself?

84
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,180
Brian?

85
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,180
Six.

86
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,180
6.5 on a good day.

87
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,180
Hubris.

88
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,180
Like delusional to rate yourself as a 10.

89
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,180
So y'all are perfect.

90
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,180
Yep.

91
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,180
Perfect.

92
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,180
Yeah.

93
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:58,300
If you guys are tens, then there's no girl that's better looking than you.

94
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,420
I love all women.

95
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,420
Every girl is a 10.

96
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,420
Every woman's a 10.

97
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,140
This is fucking copium, dude.

98
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,140
Absolutely not.

99
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,180
Hold on.

100
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,220
Every woman's a 10, but not every guy's a 10.

101
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,220
Just because I love women.

102
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,220
I'm going to be honest.

103
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,060
I'm not going to rate you guys, but none of you are a 10.

104
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,060
You just rated us.

105
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,060
That's all right.

106
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,500
No, I'm not going to give you, but none of you are a tens.

107
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
That's fine.

108
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Yeah.

109
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
We didn't ask.

110
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,340
Oh, we're all tens.

111
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,620
We don't care if guys don't think that we're tens though.

112
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,900
Also, we're all perpetually single.

113
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,500
It's like, holy shit.

114
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,220
All girls can be tens, but all guys can't be tens.

115
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,220
Oh my God.

116
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,220
Guys, guys.

117
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,580
Man, when I talk about being in a stable, steady relationship with Naomi, I feel like

118
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,180
I'm on the last plane out of Afghanistan as it falls to the Taliban.

119
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,180
You know what I mean?

120
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,460
Like, holy shit.

121
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:51,500
Imagine being a young teenager, a young early 20s guy and dating the next copper woman coming

122
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,500
out right now.

123
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Holy fuck.

124
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
These women aren't girl from material.

125
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,300
Guys, I just got back from a hinge date.

126
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,500
Why am I doing this to myself?

127
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
So we scheduled to go to dinner.

128
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
We are sitting at the restaurant.

129
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Seems very nice.

130
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
I'm not a catfish.

131
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Things are going well.

132
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
You mean catfish?

133
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
And the waitress comes over.

134
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
She wants to take her order.

135
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,500
And I said, okay, I'm going to take the branzino.

136
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
And he said, I'm going to take the burger.

137
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,500
And the waitress asked him, okay, how do you like your burger?

138
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,500
He said, how do you like this burger?

139
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
And do you want some cheese on your burger?

140
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,500
And he asked, is this going to be extra?

141
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
And she says, yes, it's $3 extra.

142
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
And he said, okay, then never mind.

143
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
I'm over there and I'm like, what the actual fuck?

144
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
I'm like, okay, I'm hungry.

145
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,500
I'm going to eat my branzino and see what happens.

146
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,500
And he's like, oh, my God, you have to pay extra for everything these days.

147
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
And I'm like, yeah, it's New York City.

148
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
So I got my branzino.

149
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
He got his burger.

150
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
We were eating.

151
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
My facial expression, guys.

152
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,500
And once I was satisfied, I got up and I was like, I'm going to the restroom for a second.

153
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,500
And I took my purse and I went to the waitress and I was like, hey, I just want to pay the bill.

154
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,500
And I just paid the bill and walked out of the restaurant and I texted him.

155
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
So I texted him, the check is taken care of.

156
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
We should have gotten the cheese.

157
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
And I blocked him.

158
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
What?

159
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
What?

160
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:31,500
So I guess she decided that he was beneath her because he didn't want to pay three dollars for cheese and a burger.

161
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Well, my man dodged a bullet and got a free meal.

162
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Jesus Christ.

163
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,500
What the fuck is up with the dating market right now, guys?

164
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
What is she doing?

165
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Who's speaking right now?

166
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
It's just Trump Tower.

167
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
She she sure fucking showed him.

168
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Oh my God.

169
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
What?

170
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
He's a rapist?

171
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
What the fuck?

172
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
You can't have a gun in an airport, lady.

173
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
What?

174
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
What did we just watch?

175
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Oh, she's getting arrested.

176
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Is she saying I hate white cocks?

177
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
What the fuck?

178
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Like, I swear, we're just watching people go schizophrenic in real fucking time.

179
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
No offense to all my schizophrenic friends out there.

180
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
You guys are great.

181
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Just don't do this, OK?

182
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Oh, she's stealing the TV.

183
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Someone lost their cart and someone's stealing the TV out of it.

184
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
You're moving too slow.

185
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Jesus.

186
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Fucking Walmarts in Chicago, guys.

187
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Oh, she just fell out the car.

188
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Oh, Lord.

189
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
What the fuck?

190
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Did she leave her...

191
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,500
She left her shoe.

192
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
She left her fucking shoe.

193
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
She left my shoe.

194
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Oh my fucking God.

195
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Like, this can't keep going on, right?

196
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
This can't keep happening.

197
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
It's not just that they're stealing from stores now.

198
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
People are now stealing from each other.

199
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Some places in America are getting to be so low trust,

200
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
you can't even have any kind of cohesive social fabric.

201
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Jesus Christ, guys, if you're an American living in the city,

202
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
get the fuck out of there, man.

203
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
I don't know what else to tell you.

204
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Shit.

205
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Oh, and speaking of cities, check this one out.

206
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
God damn it, I got it muted.

207
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
I'm not getting fucking copyright struck for that.

208
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Look at this, though.

209
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Just people standing around fucking high.

210
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Jesus.

211
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
It looks like we're in an episode of The Walking Dead or something.

212
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
There's like shuffling and listless.

213
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
What the fuck?

214
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Jesus.

215
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
The drug crisis has gotten so bad,

216
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,500
especially in these, you know, very permissive lefty cities.

217
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
I know they're doing, oh, the harm reduction thing,

218
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
my harm reduction.

219
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Yeah, okay, I understand.

220
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
There's at least a little bit of benefit to that.

221
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
But you can't be this fucking permissive.

222
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,500
You can't just be completely chill with people getting high in the street

223
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,500
and sitting around and, like, just ruining everything.

224
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
And that is what they're doing.

225
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
They're ruining the social fabric.

226
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
They're ruining the city.

227
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
They're leaving needles everywhere.

228
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
Sometimes they're becoming violent.

229
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Sometimes they're becoming a nuisance.

230
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
It's not good for them.

231
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
It's not good for their families.

232
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
It's not good for those who depend on them.

233
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
It's not good for society.

234
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
This is not, you know,

235
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
somebody wants to smoke a little bit of weed after a hard day's work or something.

236
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
This is not what this is.

237
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
What the fuck, dude?

238
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Okay, the people who send me these fucking videos need to stop with this shit.

239
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,500
I don't even know if I can show this on fucking YouTube.

240
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
This Buffalo Bill ass motherfucker.

241
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
Jesus Christ.

242
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Okay, I'm gonna watch it without the image just in case something crazy happens.

243
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
That's all I could really find.

244
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,500
But...

245
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Never mind, nothing's good in this.

246
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
I think, uh...

247
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
I think you'll like it.

248
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Hi, my name is Erin.

249
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,500
I use she, her pronouns, and I am this...

250
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Pets are awesome.

251
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
That cat knows what the fuck is up.

252
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Oh boy, here's some more druggy shit.

253
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Let's go.

254
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Jesus.

255
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
You suck!

256
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Who the fuck do you want to fight?

257
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
What?

258
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
What?

259
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
What?

260
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
What?

261
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
What?

262
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
I don't know what she's talking to.

263
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
50,000.

264
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
50,000.

265
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
50,000.

266
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
50,000.

267
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
50,000.

268
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
50,000.

269
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
50,000.

270
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Okay.

271
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
You guys gotta get her out of the fucking store.

272
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I swear to God, at some point, California's just gonna sink right into the fucking ocean,

273
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
and I can't believe it has not happened yet.

274
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
This is the last video I have.

275
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
People keep sending me these so I can react to them,

276
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
and I hope this is enough to make at least a 10-minute video for today.

277
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Let's hope, because I haven't been recording that long.

278
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
So let's check it out.

279
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,500
One of my coworkers told me that they were talking to some students in the hallway,

280
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,500
and they asked, the students asked the other teacher if I'm a boy or a girl.

281
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
And the teacher was like, does it matter?

282
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
She's cool.

283
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
She's cool, yeah.

284
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,500
And they were like, no, I just, I just can't figure it out.

285
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
It's just so hard.

286
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
I can't figure it out.

287
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Wow.

288
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
That's the goal.

289
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
That's the goal.

290
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
That's the goal.

291
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,500
The goal is to confuse students about gender.

292
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,500
We are at the point where things are becoming way more mascot than they've ever been.

293
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,500
So it's not about, you know, accepting trans people.

294
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Oh, you have a biological male who wants to transition into a woman

295
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,500
and decides to be very feminine and passes and takes up the social role

296
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
and, you know, fulfills all of society's expectations.

297
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
You get like a Blair White type or a Taftage or a Lilith Lovett.

298
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
They look very feminine.

299
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
It's like, okay, you know what, we can meet you halfway.

300
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
That's the polite thing to do in a liberal society.

301
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,500
That's not what this is.

302
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Trans acceptance was never the progressive's goal.

303
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,500
It was always about confusing people.

304
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
It was always about indoctrinating people.

305
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,500
And it was always about abolishing gender as one vector of many separate vectors

306
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,500
of revolution against liberal capitalist democracy.

307
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
That's the Gramscian view of things.

308
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
I know I've been talking about my Antonio Gramscian video for like a week now.

309
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
It's coming.

310
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
It's coming down the pipe.

311
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Don't worry.

312
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
You'll see it soon.

313
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
But for at least some of these activists

314
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
and at the expense of a lot of trans people,

315
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
this is not about trans acceptance.

316
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,500
It is about indoctrination, confusion, and subversion.

317
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
All right, that's all I've got for you today.

318
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
I hope you enjoyed the video.

319
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
If you're watching this on release,

320
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,500
me and my friends are going to be playing some of the new Bayonetta game,

321
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Bayonetta Origins.

322
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
We'll be starting the stream pretty much right when this video comes out.

323
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,500
So if you want to keep supporting the channel, come by and say hi.

324
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I'll see you there, guys.

325
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
I love you.
