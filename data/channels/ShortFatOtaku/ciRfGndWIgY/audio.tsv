0	8540	I, once again, have no time today.
8540	13100	I spent a good chunk of the day doing prep for my appearance on Adam and Sitch tomorrow.
13100	14280	Check that out, by the way.
14280	17820	And so very little time in terms of writing or anything like that.
17820	24480	Which means we're reacting to more woke nonsense because that's the easiest type of video I
24480	26120	can create right now.
26120	28240	That's just how it is, guys.
28240	31800	And hey, it makes for good repackaging into shorts later, so that's also pretty good.
31800	35360	Let's get our coffees, let's wrap ourselves in our blankets, and have a good laugh at
35360	38360	what I've dredged up from the anals of the internet today.
38360	43020	A friendly reminder to all the cis out there, just because it's called preferred name and
43020	45520	preferred pronoun, that does not make it optional.
45520	49760	And if you have trouble accepting that, then maybe instead you can accept my size 13 steel
49760	51120	toe on your trachea.
51120	53120	We could start there if you prefer.
53120	56600	Alright, dude, let's give it a go.
56600	60720	Which reminds me of that one video last time where the person said that my pronouns are
60720	61720	not optional.
61720	65040	You have to use them, and it's like, alright, at least you're open and on the table about
65040	66040	it.
66040	67040	These people can't fight to save their fucking lives.
67040	71760	But like, imagine the fucking hubris you have to have to be like this.
71760	74200	This is how you will address me when I'm not in the room.
74200	77320	It's like, Jesus Christ, dictators do that shit.
77320	88560	Listen, listen, you're not getting a robot vagina installed or anything.
88560	91600	You know, it's not like there's gonna be you know, pistons or hydraulic pressure that's
91600	94040	just gonna, you know, suck some guy's foreskin off.
94040	96800	That is not how trans vaginas work.
96800	97800	All right.
97800	98800	Oh, God, this one's from itsagundam.
98800	100140	All right, let's check it out.
100140	103640	This guy has been sending me Goodnight Queen every single night since May.
103640	106500	Anything a guy does for you, he's doing for other girls, and thank you to this man for
106500	107500	proving me right.
107500	108500	Look at this.
108500	109500	Look at this.
109500	110500	Started in May.
110500	111500	Started in May.
111500	115660	So I have bad news for you ladies, the account that's sending you Goodnight messages is not
115660	116660	a real account.
116660	121180	In early May, I built an Instagram bot that would send these messages to a group of popular
121180	126020	creators to measure the impact of artificially boosting their egos.
126020	131220	My plan was to start in May and send Goodnight to single large popular creators, and then
131220	134580	stop the messaging around December 23rd.
134580	138580	Which is right in the midst of a holiday season and the most loneliest time for a single person.
138580	143260	And I was going to demonstrate how much random people have said to a very popular creator
143260	147860	whose entire self-worth is based upon the validation and appraisal of others.
147860	151660	If I don't get a Goodnight Queen, it like hurts my feelings, and I love this.
151660	152660	And my hypothesis was correct.
152660	153660	These women said they missed the Goodnight messages.
153660	156660	They were attached to it.
156660	157660	Wow.
157660	161860	Someone called this video, some men just want to watch e-girls burn.
161860	163780	And yeah, I fucking think so.
163780	169780	Hey, I got some fucking Dove men's soap for you too.
169780	171780	Get some of that men's soap on your body.
171780	176780	Cause you smell like shit too.
176780	178780	And you're a man.
178780	180780	I'm not.
180780	182780	I'm not.
182780	188260	Okay, there's no way that this isn't fake.
188260	191940	Like this isn't a trans girl who's actually being abused by her father or something.
191940	192940	This has to be set up.
192940	193940	This looks like a joke.
193940	195420	This looks like it's made to go viral.
195420	196420	It's pretty fucking funny.
196420	198100	I hope people aren't actually taking this seriously.
198100	202100	Ah, this looks like one of those, you know, fresh and fit styled red pill podcasts.
202100	203100	Wait a minute.
203100	205060	Look at the reflection on that window in the background.
205060	206060	Is that a microwave?
206060	209060	We asked the ladies to rate themselves on a scale of one to 10.
209060	212060	I'd say I'm a 10.
212060	213060	10.
213060	214060	10.
214060	215060	10.
215060	216060	10.
216060	217060	10.
217060	219180	Send the asteroid.
219180	220180	Y'all are.
220180	221180	Come on.
221180	222180	Tens.
222180	223180	What would you rate yourself?
223180	224180	Brian?
224180	225180	Six.
225180	226180	6.5 on a good day.
226180	227180	Hubris.
227180	228180	Like delusional to rate yourself as a 10.
228180	229180	So y'all are perfect.
229180	230180	Yep.
230180	231180	Perfect.
231180	232180	Yeah.
232180	238300	If you guys are tens, then there's no girl that's better looking than you.
238300	240420	I love all women.
240420	241420	Every girl is a 10.
242420	243420	Every woman's a 10.
243420	245140	This is fucking copium, dude.
245140	246140	Absolutely not.
246140	248180	Hold on.
248180	250220	Every woman's a 10, but not every guy's a 10.
250220	251220	Just because I love women.
251220	252220	I'm going to be honest.
252220	255060	I'm not going to rate you guys, but none of you are a 10.
255060	256060	You just rated us.
256060	257060	That's all right.
257060	260500	No, I'm not going to give you, but none of you are a tens.
260500	261500	That's fine.
261500	262500	Yeah.
262500	263500	We didn't ask.
263500	265340	Oh, we're all tens.
265340	267620	We don't care if guys don't think that we're tens though.
267620	268900	Also, we're all perpetually single.
268900	270500	It's like, holy shit.
270580	273220	All girls can be tens, but all guys can't be tens.
273220	274220	Oh my God.
274220	275220	Guys, guys.
275220	280580	Man, when I talk about being in a stable, steady relationship with Naomi, I feel like
280580	284180	I'm on the last plane out of Afghanistan as it falls to the Taliban.
284180	285180	You know what I mean?
285180	286460	Like, holy shit.
286460	291500	Imagine being a young teenager, a young early 20s guy and dating the next copper woman coming
291500	292500	out right now.
292500	293500	Holy fuck.
293500	294500	These women aren't girl from material.
294500	297300	Guys, I just got back from a hinge date.
297300	299500	Why am I doing this to myself?
300500	302500	So we scheduled to go to dinner.
302500	304500	We are sitting at the restaurant.
304500	306500	Seems very nice.
306500	308500	I'm not a catfish.
308500	309500	Things are going well.
309500	310500	You mean catfish?
310500	311500	And the waitress comes over.
311500	313500	She wants to take her order.
313500	317500	And I said, okay, I'm going to take the branzino.
317500	320500	And he said, I'm going to take the burger.
320500	324500	And the waitress asked him, okay, how do you like your burger?
324500	327500	He said, how do you like this burger?
327500	329500	And do you want some cheese on your burger?
329500	333500	And he asked, is this going to be extra?
333500	336500	And she says, yes, it's $3 extra.
336500	339500	And he said, okay, then never mind.
339500	342500	I'm over there and I'm like, what the actual fuck?
342500	344500	I'm like, okay, I'm hungry.
344500	347500	I'm going to eat my branzino and see what happens.
347500	351500	And he's like, oh, my God, you have to pay extra for everything these days.
351500	354500	And I'm like, yeah, it's New York City.
354500	356500	So I got my branzino.
356500	357500	He got his burger.
357500	358500	We were eating.
358500	359500	My facial expression, guys.
359500	364500	And once I was satisfied, I got up and I was like, I'm going to the restroom for a second.
364500	370500	And I took my purse and I went to the waitress and I was like, hey, I just want to pay the bill.
370500	375500	And I just paid the bill and walked out of the restaurant and I texted him.
375500	378500	So I texted him, the check is taken care of.
378500	379500	We should have gotten the cheese.
379500	381500	And I blocked him.
381500	382500	What?
382500	383500	What?
384500	391500	So I guess she decided that he was beneath her because he didn't want to pay three dollars for cheese and a burger.
391500	394500	Well, my man dodged a bullet and got a free meal.
394500	395500	Jesus Christ.
395500	398500	What the fuck is up with the dating market right now, guys?
401500	402500	What is she doing?
404500	406500	Who's speaking right now?
406500	407500	It's just Trump Tower.
409500	411500	She she sure fucking showed him.
413500	414500	Oh my God.
419500	420500	What?
420500	422500	He's a rapist?
430500	431500	What the fuck?
433500	435500	You can't have a gun in an airport, lady.
437500	438500	What?
438500	440500	What did we just watch?
444500	446500	Oh, she's getting arrested.
453500	455500	Is she saying I hate white cocks?
455500	456500	What the fuck?
456500	460500	Like, I swear, we're just watching people go schizophrenic in real fucking time.
460500	462500	No offense to all my schizophrenic friends out there.
462500	463500	You guys are great.
463500	465500	Just don't do this, OK?
465500	470500	Oh, she's stealing the TV.
472500	475500	Someone lost their cart and someone's stealing the TV out of it.
475500	477500	You're moving too slow.
481500	482500	Jesus.
487500	489500	Fucking Walmarts in Chicago, guys.
490500	492500	Oh, she just fell out the car.
492500	493500	Oh, Lord.
494500	495500	What the fuck?
500500	501500	Did she leave her...
501500	502500	She left her shoe.
502500	503500	She left her fucking shoe.
505500	507500	She left my shoe.
509500	511500	Oh my fucking God.
511500	513500	Like, this can't keep going on, right?
513500	514500	This can't keep happening.
514500	516500	It's not just that they're stealing from stores now.
516500	518500	People are now stealing from each other.
518500	521500	Some places in America are getting to be so low trust,
521500	524500	you can't even have any kind of cohesive social fabric.
524500	526500	Jesus Christ, guys, if you're an American living in the city,
526500	527500	get the fuck out of there, man.
527500	528500	I don't know what else to tell you.
528500	529500	Shit.
529500	531500	Oh, and speaking of cities, check this one out.
535500	536500	God damn it, I got it muted.
536500	538500	I'm not getting fucking copyright struck for that.
538500	539500	Look at this, though.
539500	542500	Just people standing around fucking high.
542500	543500	Jesus.
543500	546500	It looks like we're in an episode of The Walking Dead or something.
546500	548500	There's like shuffling and listless.
548500	550500	What the fuck?
550500	552500	Jesus.
552500	554500	The drug crisis has gotten so bad,
554500	558500	especially in these, you know, very permissive lefty cities.
558500	560500	I know they're doing, oh, the harm reduction thing,
560500	561500	my harm reduction.
561500	562500	Yeah, okay, I understand.
562500	564500	There's at least a little bit of benefit to that.
564500	565500	But you can't be this fucking permissive.
565500	568500	You can't just be completely chill with people getting high in the street
568500	571500	and sitting around and, like, just ruining everything.
571500	573500	And that is what they're doing.
573500	575500	They're ruining the social fabric.
575500	576500	They're ruining the city.
576500	577500	They're leaving needles everywhere.
577500	578500	Sometimes they're becoming violent.
578500	580500	Sometimes they're becoming a nuisance.
580500	581500	It's not good for them.
581500	582500	It's not good for their families.
582500	584500	It's not good for those who depend on them.
584500	585500	It's not good for society.
585500	586500	This is not, you know,
586500	589500	somebody wants to smoke a little bit of weed after a hard day's work or something.
589500	590500	This is not what this is.
595500	596500	What the fuck, dude?
596500	599500	Okay, the people who send me these fucking videos need to stop with this shit.
599500	602500	I don't even know if I can show this on fucking YouTube.
602500	604500	This Buffalo Bill ass motherfucker.
604500	605500	Jesus Christ.
605500	609500	Okay, I'm gonna watch it without the image just in case something crazy happens.
610500	612500	That's all I could really find.
613500	614500	But...
614500	616500	Never mind, nothing's good in this.
616500	617500	I think, uh...
617500	619500	I think you'll like it.
619500	620500	Hi, my name is Erin.
620500	623500	I use she, her pronouns, and I am this...
626500	627500	Pets are awesome.
627500	629500	That cat knows what the fuck is up.
629500	630500	Oh boy, here's some more druggy shit.
630500	631500	Let's go.
635500	636500	Jesus.
637500	638500	You suck!
638500	639500	Who the fuck do you want to fight?
639500	640500	What?
640500	641500	What?
641500	642500	What?
642500	643500	What?
643500	644500	What?
644500	646500	I don't know what she's talking to.
646500	647500	50,000.
647500	648500	50,000.
649500	650500	50,000.
650500	651500	50,000.
653500	654500	50,000.
654500	655500	50,000.
658500	659500	50,000.
662500	663500	Okay.
663500	665500	You guys gotta get her out of the fucking store.
671500	675500	I swear to God, at some point, California's just gonna sink right into the fucking ocean,
675500	677500	and I can't believe it has not happened yet.
677500	678500	This is the last video I have.
678500	680500	People keep sending me these so I can react to them,
680500	683500	and I hope this is enough to make at least a 10-minute video for today.
683500	685500	Let's hope, because I haven't been recording that long.
685500	686500	So let's check it out.
687500	692500	One of my coworkers told me that they were talking to some students in the hallway,
692500	698500	and they asked, the students asked the other teacher if I'm a boy or a girl.
698500	700500	And the teacher was like, does it matter?
700500	701500	She's cool.
701500	702500	She's cool, yeah.
702500	707500	And they were like, no, I just, I just can't figure it out.
707500	708500	It's just so hard.
708500	710500	I can't figure it out.
712500	713500	Wow.
713500	714500	That's the goal.
715500	716500	That's the goal.
716500	717500	That's the goal.
717500	721500	The goal is to confuse students about gender.
721500	726500	We are at the point where things are becoming way more mascot than they've ever been.
726500	729500	So it's not about, you know, accepting trans people.
729500	732500	Oh, you have a biological male who wants to transition into a woman
732500	736500	and decides to be very feminine and passes and takes up the social role
736500	738500	and, you know, fulfills all of society's expectations.
738500	741500	You get like a Blair White type or a Taftage or a Lilith Lovett.
741500	742500	They look very feminine.
742500	744500	It's like, okay, you know what, we can meet you halfway.
744500	746500	That's the polite thing to do in a liberal society.
746500	747500	That's not what this is.
747500	750500	Trans acceptance was never the progressive's goal.
750500	753500	It was always about confusing people.
753500	755500	It was always about indoctrinating people.
755500	761500	And it was always about abolishing gender as one vector of many separate vectors
761500	765500	of revolution against liberal capitalist democracy.
765500	767500	That's the Gramscian view of things.
767500	769500	I know I've been talking about my Antonio Gramscian video for like a week now.
769500	770500	It's coming.
770500	771500	It's coming down the pipe.
771500	772500	Don't worry.
772500	773500	You'll see it soon.
773500	775500	But for at least some of these activists
775500	778500	and at the expense of a lot of trans people,
778500	780500	this is not about trans acceptance.
780500	784500	It is about indoctrination, confusion, and subversion.
784500	786500	All right, that's all I've got for you today.
786500	787500	I hope you enjoyed the video.
787500	789500	If you're watching this on release,
789500	792500	me and my friends are going to be playing some of the new Bayonetta game,
792500	793500	Bayonetta Origins.
793500	795500	We'll be starting the stream pretty much right when this video comes out.
795500	798500	So if you want to keep supporting the channel, come by and say hi.
798500	799500	I'll see you there, guys.
799500	800500	I love you.
