00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
Tiktok, Tiktok Tuesday. I don't know why I'm singing it. Hi, guys. Welcome to Tiktok Tuesday.

00:06.800 --> 00:10.560
I know I missed last week, so a bunch of these have been saved up. Let's see what we've got.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.800
One such thing as parental rights.

00:12.800 --> 00:13.040
What?

00:13.040 --> 00:17.440
It's not recognized in law. It's not in the charter. It doesn't exist. Children's rights,

00:17.440 --> 00:23.600
however, are recognized and have been for a very long time. Parents have responsibility,

00:23.600 --> 00:28.720
which is recognized in the law, but no rights. If your child does not want to

00:29.280 --> 00:37.200
tell you something about them, that's your problem. Not the government's, not the school systems.

00:37.200 --> 00:44.160
Maybe you should ask yourself why your child might not want to tell you whatever it is your

00:44.160 --> 00:47.200
conspiracy brain thinks that they should have to.

00:47.200 --> 00:52.800
There's a strange situation going on with this one. Man, this is the first one today,

00:52.800 --> 00:56.720
and we're already going down some weird rabbit holes here, guys. On the one hand,

00:56.720 --> 01:00.800
we all remember what it was like to be a kid, right? We did keep things from our parents.

01:00.800 --> 01:05.040
If we were doing a little bit of underage drinking at our friend's house, we didn't tell them.

01:05.040 --> 01:10.000
If we were 15 or 16 or 17, we were hooking up with a girl, we didn't tell them.

01:10.560 --> 01:16.000
Kids absolutely keep things from their parents all the time. You're lying in bed in the middle

01:16.000 --> 01:19.600
of the night, and you're jacking off because you're a horny 14-year-old or something.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.080
You don't tell your parents that. Now, your parents also aren't dumb,

01:24.080 --> 01:27.520
they can sometimes figure out some of the nonsense you're trying to pull as a kid.

01:27.520 --> 01:34.960
But the point is, is that it is understandable why a child would want privacy from their parents.

01:34.960 --> 01:40.160
And yes, this also extends to gay and trans stuff. Let's say you have a 14-year-old boy,

01:40.160 --> 01:43.360
he thinks he's gay, he doesn't want to come out to his parents, he doesn't have to,

01:43.360 --> 01:46.640
especially if he thinks his parents are going to beat him or something. That all makes sense,

01:47.040 --> 01:51.840
but from the other side of the situation, there actually are parental rights,

01:51.840 --> 01:54.880
especially when it comes to things that are considered to be medical.

01:54.880 --> 02:00.160
When it comes to a medical procedure, parents do have to sign off. Now, medical practitioners

02:00.160 --> 02:04.640
can go around the parents and get a court order if they think the parents are being neglectful.

02:04.640 --> 02:08.400
That's not for school teachers to decide or school officials. That's also not for random

02:08.400 --> 02:15.200
adults on TikTok to decide. That is for courts and doctors. And as I'm constantly reminded,

02:15.200 --> 02:22.000
the trans conversation is a medical conversation. That's why you're literally killing trans people

02:22.000 --> 02:27.600
by inducing them to suicide if you don't affirm them. So because it's a medical conversation,

02:27.600 --> 02:32.640
and transitioning is treatment for a mental illness, yeah, it would seem to be the case that

02:32.640 --> 02:37.360
you can't actually just go around parents in that situation. So while it might be the case that if

02:37.360 --> 02:41.520
you have a child and that child thinks that they're trans, they don't have to tell you,

02:41.520 --> 02:46.160
even though you're their parent. That's true. But if you have a teacher who is affirming that child

02:46.160 --> 02:50.960
and allowing them to cross-dress at school or something, well, that's a medical treatment,

02:50.960 --> 02:55.680
and the teacher isn't qualified. And that does, in fact, usurp the rights of the parents.

02:55.680 --> 03:01.680
God loves you. God loves you, man. It is the love of God,

03:02.240 --> 03:07.040
of why you're angry, of why you're mad. Oh, this is like an on-campus presentation.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.320
Is this like a pro-choice versus pro-life thing?

03:24.400 --> 03:31.920
Is she trying to rattle them? Figure it out, lady. What else?

03:31.920 --> 03:37.440
What's your name? That's none of your business.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.960
I mean, we're being cordial here. You hear? Got my mic? We're being cordial, right?

03:40.960 --> 03:42.480
She's just trying to get under her skin. It's not working.

03:42.480 --> 03:49.920
My name is Lancaster. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I mean, nice to meet you. Is that,

03:49.920 --> 03:53.920
you just came up here and tell us your business without giving us your name?

03:53.920 --> 03:58.320
Yeah, that's what I did. Okay, all right. We'll pray for you, okay?

03:58.320 --> 04:00.160
We'll pray the Lord saved you. Oh, don't put your hands on her,

04:00.160 --> 04:03.760
dude. That's assault now. I wish I knew your name so we could know where to pray.

04:03.760 --> 04:08.480
Well, either way. Either way. You're a soul. Either way, you're a soul.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.680
You're kind of an asshole. What makes me that?

04:11.680 --> 04:16.000
You kind of ruined everybody's lunch. You took the cord out?

04:16.000 --> 04:20.560
Yeah, I took the cord out. You want to give me my mic back? Please give me my mic back, please.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.480
Please, young lady. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good day, okay? You're not stronger than me,

04:24.480 --> 04:26.880
all right? God bless you. She just wants to steal the mic?

04:26.880 --> 04:30.320
Hey, officer. This young lady, she's trying to rip my stuff up.

04:30.320 --> 04:33.600
Oh, I'm assaulting her. She's assaulted. She's taking his stuff.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.200
Come here. I have it on video.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.240
Yeah. I'm assaulting her.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.000
Yes. Yeah, dude, like, leave.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.640
Yeah. Let go of my stuff.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.480
Okay, if I get arrested right now, I would literally lash out.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.720
You're literally going to lash out? Oh, my God.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.480
Like, what the fuck, Lee? Just let go of the mic.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.040
We get it. You don't agree? Just let go of the mic.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.840
Walk away right now. I already said I was going to let it go.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.320
Can I get my stuff? Can I get my stuff, ma'am?

05:08.320 --> 05:09.200
She's going to get arrested.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.040
Can I ask a question? Of course.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.440
But let go right now. Let go right now.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.880
Yes or no? Let go right now.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.000
Yes, no. Yes or no?

05:18.000 --> 05:18.960
You're under arrest.

05:18.960 --> 05:19.760
Yep. That's what you get.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.680
Put your hands behind you.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.280
We pray for the grace of God for you.

05:23.280 --> 05:28.320
Wow. Like, that was over nothing, guys.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.480
She could have just walked.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.040
Yeah, okay. They disagree and all that.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.600
I know she went up there trying to be edgy as fuck,

05:35.600 --> 05:38.560
and she thought that she would get these Christians all mad and triggered,

05:38.560 --> 05:40.800
and they weren't, and they simply said, we'll pray for you.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.800
And then she got mad that they weren't getting mad, and she got herself arrested.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.560
Like, it's stupid. It's fucking stupidity.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.040
I'm ultimately pro-choice, and this is still fucking stupid.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.160
This isn't how you do it, man.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.080
Oh, man, that's beautiful, isn't it?

05:56.080 --> 05:57.280
Going to Indian Hogwarts.

06:00.480 --> 06:01.440
iPhone 14.

06:07.280 --> 06:11.040
That's why you gotta wear, like, a wrist strap or something on your phone, dude.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.800
Especially if you're in the third world.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.240
Jesus. I wonder if that was staged.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.120
That might have been staged.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.440
It was, like, too good to be true, but I don't know.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.240
Probably wasn't.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.440
My belief is that we should be centering the voices and experiences

06:21.440 --> 06:24.480
of the most marginalized people and communities at all times.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.200
So when I think about what fat liberation looks like to me,

06:27.200 --> 06:31.520
it looks like centering the voices and experiences of those who live in

06:31.520 --> 06:35.280
and who maneuver through spaces and institutions in a fat body.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.600
It looks like making accessible spaces and having conversations that are aware

06:39.600 --> 06:45.120
of the fact that people have different bodies and that they are interacting with space and people

06:45.120 --> 06:48.000
and institutions and communities in a different way.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.360
Fat liberation looks like fully embracing those differences

06:51.360 --> 06:54.240
and having those conversations instead of shying away from them.

06:54.240 --> 07:00.160
To learn more about fat liberation and the campaign for size freedom that Dove is supporting,

07:00.160 --> 07:02.560
visit dove.com forward slash size freedom.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.120
Well, wait a minute.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.520
This is like, this is sponsored by Dove?

07:05.520 --> 07:07.680
This is important and we should all be talking about it.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.360
I guess it makes sense, doesn't it?

07:09.360 --> 07:11.680
If you're fatter, you have more total skin.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.920
So therefore you need to use up more of their soap.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.560
This is like a good, this is a good, this is a good,

07:17.360 --> 07:19.200
this is a good business decision for them.

07:19.200 --> 07:19.440
Okay.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.320
I got to rewatch some of that.

07:20.320 --> 07:20.960
Give me a second here.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.440
So when I think about what fat liberation looks like to me,

07:23.440 --> 07:28.000
it looks like centering the voices and the experiences of those who live in

07:28.000 --> 07:29.840
and who maneuver through spaces.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.840
I don't know what spaces you're maneuvering through,

07:31.840 --> 07:33.840
but it's probably a pretty tight squeeze.

07:33.840 --> 07:34.400
Isn't it?

07:34.400 --> 07:35.360
Haha.

07:35.360 --> 07:35.600
Yeah.

07:35.600 --> 07:35.920
That's it.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.280
I just wanted to rewatch for a joke.

07:37.280 --> 07:41.040
I finally cracked the code for permanently staying in the honeymoon phase with your partner.

07:41.040 --> 07:41.360
Awesome.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.120
Before you think that's not possible, I can be gone for 15 minutes and this man will greet

07:45.120 --> 07:46.320
me like I've been gone for a week.

07:46.320 --> 07:49.040
There's not one time I've said, Hey, I really feel like a walk.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.040
And he's been like, nah, I'd rather stay home.

07:51.040 --> 07:54.640
And no matter how mad we may be at each other, we always sleep in the same bed.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.000
Isn't that right?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.440
It's a fucking dog.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.080
I knew it.

07:58.960 --> 07:59.840
Get a dog.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.120
Dog pill, guys.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.480
You cannot escape it.

08:02.480 --> 08:06.080
As soon as she said going for walks, I was like, this is, it's going to be dog pill,

08:06.080 --> 08:06.400
isn't it?

08:06.400 --> 08:06.900
Fuck.

08:08.080 --> 08:08.960
Then what is Mexico?

08:08.960 --> 08:11.120
What is this weird video we're watching?

08:11.120 --> 08:12.240
Is Mexico a continent?

08:12.240 --> 08:13.120
Hold the time out.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.000
Oh my God.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.600
This is the world.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.080
Mexico.

08:16.080 --> 08:16.480
Yeah.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.040
Okay.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.040
See each of these large masses.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.040
How many do you count?

08:21.040 --> 08:24.320
One, two, three, four, five.

08:24.320 --> 08:24.880
Right.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.320
However, this right here, Oh no, down here.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.880
Where's the city and what's the county?

08:32.320 --> 08:36.160
She's already telling you it's not on here right now.

08:36.160 --> 08:37.760
How dumb are these kids?

08:38.960 --> 08:39.760
What about Greenland?

08:39.760 --> 08:40.320
Are there seven?

08:40.320 --> 08:41.280
I thought it was seven.

08:42.240 --> 08:42.800
It's seven.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.640
Even the teacher doesn't know.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.840
Oh, oh, oh, oh my God.

08:53.840 --> 08:54.080
Okay.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.240
This is actually like unlocking a few memories for me.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.320
I know everyone looks at videos like these and they're like,

08:58.320 --> 09:00.800
Oh, the zoomers are uniquely stupid or something or like,

09:00.800 --> 09:02.640
Oh, there's so many like terrible teachers.

09:03.440 --> 09:07.280
I'm thinking back now I went to, uh, to grade school in the nineties.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.360
There were some pretty dumb fucking kids.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.040
I know these, I think the kids are high school, right?

09:11.120 --> 09:13.520
Even in high school, there were some pretty dumb fucking kids.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.000
Yeah, man.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.080
I remember, I'm remembering now, like sitting in like various geography

09:18.080 --> 09:23.520
classes in like grade three or something and kids not understanding what maps were.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.680
Maybe it was because I played video games, you know?

09:25.680 --> 09:29.920
I was really young, really young playing Super Nintendo games that like my, um,

09:29.920 --> 09:32.720
that I think were my dad's old games or something, you know?

09:32.720 --> 09:35.360
Link to the past, you hit select, you pull the map and it's like,

09:35.360 --> 09:36.560
Oh, you get it.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.800
Like when you're playing a game because you care about the game.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.440
So when I get to school and it's like, here's how maps were children.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.480
I was like, yeah, I already got this shit.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.720
And you know, being like seven years old or something, just slap it down.

09:44.720 --> 09:44.800
Yeah.

09:44.800 --> 09:45.680
Here's what the city is here.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.320
Here's the road.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.000
And the kids are like, whoa, whoa.

09:48.000 --> 09:48.160
Yeah.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.840
I'm not sure that like zoomers, keep in mind, this is high school now, not grade

09:51.840 --> 09:52.240
school, right?

09:52.240 --> 09:55.200
But even in high school, there were kids who still didn't know what maps were when

09:55.200 --> 09:55.840
I was there.

09:55.840 --> 09:59.840
Maybe zoomers are uniquely stupid or maybe we're just capturing more of their

09:59.840 --> 10:01.040
stupidity with smartphones.

10:01.040 --> 10:01.440
Who knows?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.360
Either way, it's disheartening to watch.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.880
It was really bad because I was like, I felt so bad about it.

10:06.880 --> 10:08.000
What is its quality?

10:08.400 --> 10:12.320
I called like child services on this one.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.360
I called child services on my ex because he pissed me off.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.440
And then I was like, yeah, I'm done with this person, whatever.

10:19.440 --> 10:24.320
Like, you know, cheater, fucking piece of shit, lies, bullshit.

10:24.320 --> 10:25.600
He had kids.

10:25.600 --> 10:34.480
I called child services on his ass and I like fabricated everything and like

10:34.720 --> 10:38.400
said certain things and they like went to the door and like there was a whole

10:38.400 --> 10:39.280
process.

10:39.280 --> 10:42.880
Like, I don't even know if the children's aid worker still visits them, but she

10:42.880 --> 10:46.880
probably does because what I said, like the way I AI'd that shit, you know, like

10:46.880 --> 10:50.240
real AI shit, like fake bruises.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.560
Oh my God.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.760
Be careful, fellas.

10:53.760 --> 10:54.320
Yeah.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.240
Yeah, pretty crazy.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.080
What a terrible fucking person.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.000
And then you just made like an exaggeration story.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.840
And on their kid, on his kids.

11:02.400 --> 11:02.880
Yeah.

11:02.880 --> 11:04.720
Like, so like, yeah, then they came.

11:04.720 --> 11:05.600
What a piece of shit.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.360
They're both pieces of shit.

11:07.360 --> 11:09.920
She actually cheated, but your kids are being abused.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.160
You know, you could lose your kids.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.880
This fucking sociopath.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.240
Yeah, should have been nicer to me, bitch.

11:20.960 --> 11:21.360
Wow.

11:22.000 --> 11:22.720
Oh, okay.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.520
I'm, I'm, I'm done with TikTok Tuesday for today.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.200
Holy fuck.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.560
That was, uh, that was like a hardcore black pill.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.520
That black pill was darker than her fake fucking tan.

11:33.520 --> 11:33.840
All right.

11:33.840 --> 11:34.720
That's enough of this guys.

11:34.720 --> 11:35.920
Let's get the fuck out of here.

11:35.920 --> 11:40.000
All right, listen, if you're watching this on release, uh, I'm streaming right

11:40.000 --> 11:41.920
after this gets uploaded.

11:41.920 --> 11:42.160
Okay.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.520
So drop in, say hi.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.760
If you don't, you're not a real dev fan.

11:47.760 --> 11:50.880
If you don't, uh, I'll call protective services.

11:50.880 --> 11:51.440
Okay.

11:51.440 --> 11:54.560
In all seriousness, I'm going to go, I am streaming tonight.

11:54.560 --> 11:55.520
Drop in and say hi.

11:55.520 --> 11:58.560
I'm playing some, uh, some more of that sea of stars game with my friends.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.000
And, uh, thanks for being here guys.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.960
I'll see you next time.
