00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Tiktok, Tiktok Tuesday. I don't know why I'm singing it. Hi, guys. Welcome to Tiktok Tuesday.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,560
I know I missed last week, so a bunch of these have been saved up. Let's see what we've got.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,800
One such thing as parental rights.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,040
What?

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,440
It's not recognized in law. It's not in the charter. It doesn't exist. Children's rights,

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,600
however, are recognized and have been for a very long time. Parents have responsibility,

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,720
which is recognized in the law, but no rights. If your child does not want to

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:37,200
tell you something about them, that's your problem. Not the government's, not the school systems.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,160
Maybe you should ask yourself why your child might not want to tell you whatever it is your

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,200
conspiracy brain thinks that they should have to.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,800
There's a strange situation going on with this one. Man, this is the first one today,

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,720
and we're already going down some weird rabbit holes here, guys. On the one hand,

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,800
we all remember what it was like to be a kid, right? We did keep things from our parents.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,040
If we were doing a little bit of underage drinking at our friend's house, we didn't tell them.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,000
If we were 15 or 16 or 17, we were hooking up with a girl, we didn't tell them.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,000
Kids absolutely keep things from their parents all the time. You're lying in bed in the middle

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,600
of the night, and you're jacking off because you're a horny 14-year-old or something.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,080
You don't tell your parents that. Now, your parents also aren't dumb,

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,520
they can sometimes figure out some of the nonsense you're trying to pull as a kid.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,960
But the point is, is that it is understandable why a child would want privacy from their parents.

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,160
And yes, this also extends to gay and trans stuff. Let's say you have a 14-year-old boy,

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,360
he thinks he's gay, he doesn't want to come out to his parents, he doesn't have to,

23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,640
especially if he thinks his parents are going to beat him or something. That all makes sense,

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,840
but from the other side of the situation, there actually are parental rights,

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,880
especially when it comes to things that are considered to be medical.

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,160
When it comes to a medical procedure, parents do have to sign off. Now, medical practitioners

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,640
can go around the parents and get a court order if they think the parents are being neglectful.

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,400
That's not for school teachers to decide or school officials. That's also not for random

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:15,200
adults on TikTok to decide. That is for courts and doctors. And as I'm constantly reminded,

30
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,000
the trans conversation is a medical conversation. That's why you're literally killing trans people

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,600
by inducing them to suicide if you don't affirm them. So because it's a medical conversation,

32
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,640
and transitioning is treatment for a mental illness, yeah, it would seem to be the case that

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,360
you can't actually just go around parents in that situation. So while it might be the case that if

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,520
you have a child and that child thinks that they're trans, they don't have to tell you,

35
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,160
even though you're their parent. That's true. But if you have a teacher who is affirming that child

36
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,960
and allowing them to cross-dress at school or something, well, that's a medical treatment,

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,680
and the teacher isn't qualified. And that does, in fact, usurp the rights of the parents.

38
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,680
God loves you. God loves you, man. It is the love of God,

39
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,040
of why you're angry, of why you're mad. Oh, this is like an on-campus presentation.

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,320
Is this like a pro-choice versus pro-life thing?

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,920
Is she trying to rattle them? Figure it out, lady. What else?

42
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,440
What's your name? That's none of your business.

43
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,960
I mean, we're being cordial here. You hear? Got my mic? We're being cordial, right?

44
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,480
She's just trying to get under her skin. It's not working.

45
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,920
My name is Lancaster. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I mean, nice to meet you. Is that,

46
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,920
you just came up here and tell us your business without giving us your name?

47
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,320
Yeah, that's what I did. Okay, all right. We'll pray for you, okay?

48
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,160
We'll pray the Lord saved you. Oh, don't put your hands on her,

49
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,760
dude. That's assault now. I wish I knew your name so we could know where to pray.

50
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,480
Well, either way. Either way. You're a soul. Either way, you're a soul.

51
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,680
You're kind of an asshole. What makes me that?

52
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,000
You kind of ruined everybody's lunch. You took the cord out?

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,560
Yeah, I took the cord out. You want to give me my mic back? Please give me my mic back, please.

54
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,480
Please, young lady. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good day, okay? You're not stronger than me,

55
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,880
all right? God bless you. She just wants to steal the mic?

56
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,320
Hey, officer. This young lady, she's trying to rip my stuff up.

57
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,600
Oh, I'm assaulting her. She's assaulted. She's taking his stuff.

58
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,200
Come here. I have it on video.

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,240
Yeah. I'm assaulting her.

60
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes. Yeah, dude, like, leave.

61
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,640
Yeah. Let go of my stuff.

62
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,480
Okay, if I get arrested right now, I would literally lash out.

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,720
You're literally going to lash out? Oh, my God.

64
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,480
Like, what the fuck, Lee? Just let go of the mic.

65
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,040
We get it. You don't agree? Just let go of the mic.

66
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,840
Walk away right now. I already said I was going to let it go.

67
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,320
Can I get my stuff? Can I get my stuff, ma'am?

68
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,200
She's going to get arrested.

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,040
Can I ask a question? Of course.

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,440
But let go right now. Let go right now.

71
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
Yes or no? Let go right now.

72
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes, no. Yes or no?

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,960
You're under arrest.

74
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,760
Yep. That's what you get.

75
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,680
Put your hands behind you.

76
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,280
We pray for the grace of God for you.

77
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,320
Wow. Like, that was over nothing, guys.

78
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,480
She could have just walked.

79
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Yeah, okay. They disagree and all that.

80
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,600
I know she went up there trying to be edgy as fuck,

81
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,560
and she thought that she would get these Christians all mad and triggered,

82
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,800
and they weren't, and they simply said, we'll pray for you.

83
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
And then she got mad that they weren't getting mad, and she got herself arrested.

84
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,560
Like, it's stupid. It's fucking stupidity.

85
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,040
I'm ultimately pro-choice, and this is still fucking stupid.

86
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,160
This isn't how you do it, man.

87
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,080
Oh, man, that's beautiful, isn't it?

88
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,280
Going to Indian Hogwarts.

89
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,440
iPhone 14.

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,040
That's why you gotta wear, like, a wrist strap or something on your phone, dude.

91
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,800
Especially if you're in the third world.

92
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
Jesus. I wonder if that was staged.

93
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,120
That might have been staged.

94
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,440
It was, like, too good to be true, but I don't know.

95
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,240
Probably wasn't.

96
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,440
My belief is that we should be centering the voices and experiences

97
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,480
of the most marginalized people and communities at all times.

98
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,200
So when I think about what fat liberation looks like to me,

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,520
it looks like centering the voices and experiences of those who live in

100
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,280
and who maneuver through spaces and institutions in a fat body.

101
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,600
It looks like making accessible spaces and having conversations that are aware

102
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,120
of the fact that people have different bodies and that they are interacting with space and people

103
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,000
and institutions and communities in a different way.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,360
Fat liberation looks like fully embracing those differences

105
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,240
and having those conversations instead of shying away from them.

106
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,160
To learn more about fat liberation and the campaign for size freedom that Dove is supporting,

107
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,560
visit dove.com forward slash size freedom.

108
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,120
Well, wait a minute.

109
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
This is like, this is sponsored by Dove?

110
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,680
This is important and we should all be talking about it.

111
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
I guess it makes sense, doesn't it?

112
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,680
If you're fatter, you have more total skin.

113
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,920
So therefore you need to use up more of their soap.

114
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,560
This is like a good, this is a good, this is a good,

115
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,200
this is a good business decision for them.

116
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,440
Okay.

117
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,320
I got to rewatch some of that.

118
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,960
Give me a second here.

119
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,440
So when I think about what fat liberation looks like to me,

120
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,000
it looks like centering the voices and the experiences of those who live in

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,840
and who maneuver through spaces.

122
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
I don't know what spaces you're maneuvering through,

123
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
but it's probably a pretty tight squeeze.

124
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,400
Isn't it?

125
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,360
Haha.

126
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,600
Yeah.

127
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:35,920
That's it.

128
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,280
I just wanted to rewatch for a joke.

129
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,040
I finally cracked the code for permanently staying in the honeymoon phase with your partner.

130
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,360
Awesome.

131
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,120
Before you think that's not possible, I can be gone for 15 minutes and this man will greet

132
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,320
me like I've been gone for a week.

133
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,040
There's not one time I've said, Hey, I really feel like a walk.

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,040
And he's been like, nah, I'd rather stay home.

135
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,640
And no matter how mad we may be at each other, we always sleep in the same bed.

136
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,000
Isn't that right?

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,440
It's a fucking dog.

138
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,080
I knew it.

139
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,840
Get a dog.

140
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,120
Dog pill, guys.

141
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,480
You cannot escape it.

142
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,080
As soon as she said going for walks, I was like, this is, it's going to be dog pill,

143
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,400
isn't it?

144
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:06,900
Fuck.

145
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,960
Then what is Mexico?

146
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
What is this weird video we're watching?

147
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,240
Is Mexico a continent?

148
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,120
Hold the time out.

149
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh my God.

150
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,600
This is the world.

151
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,080
Mexico.

152
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,480
Yeah.

153
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,040
Okay.

154
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
See each of these large masses.

155
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,040
How many do you count?

156
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,320
One, two, three, four, five.

157
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,880
Right.

158
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,320
However, this right here, Oh no, down here.

159
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,880
Where's the city and what's the county?

160
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,160
She's already telling you it's not on here right now.

161
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,760
How dumb are these kids?

162
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,760
What about Greenland?

163
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,320
Are there seven?

164
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,280
I thought it was seven.

165
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,800
It's seven.

166
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,640
Even the teacher doesn't know.

167
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh my God.

168
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,080
Okay.

169
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
This is actually like unlocking a few memories for me.

170
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,320
I know everyone looks at videos like these and they're like,

171
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
Oh, the zoomers are uniquely stupid or something or like,

172
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,640
Oh, there's so many like terrible teachers.

173
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,280
I'm thinking back now I went to, uh, to grade school in the nineties.

174
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,360
There were some pretty dumb fucking kids.

175
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,040
I know these, I think the kids are high school, right?

176
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,520
Even in high school, there were some pretty dumb fucking kids.

177
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, man.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,080
I remember, I'm remembering now, like sitting in like various geography

179
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,520
classes in like grade three or something and kids not understanding what maps were.

180
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,680
Maybe it was because I played video games, you know?

181
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,920
I was really young, really young playing Super Nintendo games that like my, um,

182
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,720
that I think were my dad's old games or something, you know?

183
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,360
Link to the past, you hit select, you pull the map and it's like,

184
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,560
Oh, you get it.

185
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,800
Like when you're playing a game because you care about the game.

186
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,440
So when I get to school and it's like, here's how maps were children.

187
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,480
I was like, yeah, I already got this shit.

188
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,720
And you know, being like seven years old or something, just slap it down.

189
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:44,800
Yeah.

190
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,680
Here's what the city is here.

191
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,320
Here's the road.

192
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,000
And the kids are like, whoa, whoa.

193
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,160
Yeah.

194
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,840
I'm not sure that like zoomers, keep in mind, this is high school now, not grade

195
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,240
school, right?

196
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,200
But even in high school, there were kids who still didn't know what maps were when

197
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,840
I was there.

198
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,840
Maybe zoomers are uniquely stupid or maybe we're just capturing more of their

199
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,040
stupidity with smartphones.

200
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,440
Who knows?

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,360
Either way, it's disheartening to watch.

202
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,880
It was really bad because I was like, I felt so bad about it.

203
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,000
What is its quality?

204
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,320
I called like child services on this one.

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,360
I called child services on my ex because he pissed me off.

206
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,440
And then I was like, yeah, I'm done with this person, whatever.

207
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,320
Like, you know, cheater, fucking piece of shit, lies, bullshit.

208
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,600
He had kids.

209
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:34,480
I called child services on his ass and I like fabricated everything and like

210
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,400
said certain things and they like went to the door and like there was a whole

211
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,280
process.

212
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,880
Like, I don't even know if the children's aid worker still visits them, but she

213
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,880
probably does because what I said, like the way I AI'd that shit, you know, like

214
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,240
real AI shit, like fake bruises.

215
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,560
Oh my God.

216
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,760
Be careful, fellas.

217
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,320
Yeah.

218
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,240
Yeah, pretty crazy.

219
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,080
What a terrible fucking person.

220
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,000
And then you just made like an exaggeration story.

221
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,840
And on their kid, on his kids.

222
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,880
Yeah.

223
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,720
Like, so like, yeah, then they came.

224
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,600
What a piece of shit.

225
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,360
They're both pieces of shit.

226
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,920
She actually cheated, but your kids are being abused.

227
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,160
You know, you could lose your kids.

228
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,880
This fucking sociopath.

229
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,240
Yeah, should have been nicer to me, bitch.

230
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,360
Wow.

231
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,720
Oh, okay.

232
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,520
I'm, I'm, I'm done with TikTok Tuesday for today.

233
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,200
Holy fuck.

234
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,560
That was, uh, that was like a hardcore black pill.

235
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,520
That black pill was darker than her fake fucking tan.

236
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:33,840
All right.

237
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,720
That's enough of this guys.

238
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,920
Let's get the fuck out of here.

239
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,000
All right, listen, if you're watching this on release, uh, I'm streaming right

240
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
after this gets uploaded.

241
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,160
Okay.

242
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,520
So drop in, say hi.

243
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,760
If you don't, you're not a real dev fan.

244
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,880
If you don't, uh, I'll call protective services.

245
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,440
Okay.

246
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,560
In all seriousness, I'm going to go, I am streaming tonight.

247
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,520
Drop in and say hi.

248
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,560
I'm playing some, uh, some more of that sea of stars game with my friends.

249
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,000
And, uh, thanks for being here guys.

250
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,960
