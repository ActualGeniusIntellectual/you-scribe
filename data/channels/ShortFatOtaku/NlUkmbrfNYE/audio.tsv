0	6800	Tiktok, Tiktok Tuesday. I don't know why I'm singing it. Hi, guys. Welcome to Tiktok Tuesday.
6800	10560	I know I missed last week, so a bunch of these have been saved up. Let's see what we've got.
10560	12800	One such thing as parental rights.
12800	13040	What?
13040	17440	It's not recognized in law. It's not in the charter. It doesn't exist. Children's rights,
17440	23600	however, are recognized and have been for a very long time. Parents have responsibility,
23600	28720	which is recognized in the law, but no rights. If your child does not want to
29280	37200	tell you something about them, that's your problem. Not the government's, not the school systems.
37200	44160	Maybe you should ask yourself why your child might not want to tell you whatever it is your
44160	47200	conspiracy brain thinks that they should have to.
47200	52800	There's a strange situation going on with this one. Man, this is the first one today,
52800	56720	and we're already going down some weird rabbit holes here, guys. On the one hand,
56720	60800	we all remember what it was like to be a kid, right? We did keep things from our parents.
60800	65040	If we were doing a little bit of underage drinking at our friend's house, we didn't tell them.
65040	70000	If we were 15 or 16 or 17, we were hooking up with a girl, we didn't tell them.
70560	76000	Kids absolutely keep things from their parents all the time. You're lying in bed in the middle
76000	79600	of the night, and you're jacking off because you're a horny 14-year-old or something.
80080	84080	You don't tell your parents that. Now, your parents also aren't dumb,
84080	87520	they can sometimes figure out some of the nonsense you're trying to pull as a kid.
87520	94960	But the point is, is that it is understandable why a child would want privacy from their parents.
94960	100160	And yes, this also extends to gay and trans stuff. Let's say you have a 14-year-old boy,
100160	103360	he thinks he's gay, he doesn't want to come out to his parents, he doesn't have to,
103360	106640	especially if he thinks his parents are going to beat him or something. That all makes sense,
107040	111840	but from the other side of the situation, there actually are parental rights,
111840	114880	especially when it comes to things that are considered to be medical.
114880	120160	When it comes to a medical procedure, parents do have to sign off. Now, medical practitioners
120160	124640	can go around the parents and get a court order if they think the parents are being neglectful.
124640	128400	That's not for school teachers to decide or school officials. That's also not for random
128400	135200	adults on TikTok to decide. That is for courts and doctors. And as I'm constantly reminded,
135200	142000	the trans conversation is a medical conversation. That's why you're literally killing trans people
142000	147600	by inducing them to suicide if you don't affirm them. So because it's a medical conversation,
147600	152640	and transitioning is treatment for a mental illness, yeah, it would seem to be the case that
152640	157360	you can't actually just go around parents in that situation. So while it might be the case that if
157360	161520	you have a child and that child thinks that they're trans, they don't have to tell you,
161520	166160	even though you're their parent. That's true. But if you have a teacher who is affirming that child
166160	170960	and allowing them to cross-dress at school or something, well, that's a medical treatment,
170960	175680	and the teacher isn't qualified. And that does, in fact, usurp the rights of the parents.
175680	181680	God loves you. God loves you, man. It is the love of God,
182240	187040	of why you're angry, of why you're mad. Oh, this is like an on-campus presentation.
187920	190320	Is this like a pro-choice versus pro-life thing?
204400	211920	Is she trying to rattle them? Figure it out, lady. What else?
211920	217440	What's your name? That's none of your business.
217440	220960	I mean, we're being cordial here. You hear? Got my mic? We're being cordial, right?
220960	222480	She's just trying to get under her skin. It's not working.
222480	229920	My name is Lancaster. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I mean, nice to meet you. Is that,
229920	233920	you just came up here and tell us your business without giving us your name?
233920	238320	Yeah, that's what I did. Okay, all right. We'll pray for you, okay?
238320	240160	We'll pray the Lord saved you. Oh, don't put your hands on her,
240160	243760	dude. That's assault now. I wish I knew your name so we could know where to pray.
243760	248480	Well, either way. Either way. You're a soul. Either way, you're a soul.
248480	251680	You're kind of an asshole. What makes me that?
251680	256000	You kind of ruined everybody's lunch. You took the cord out?
256000	260560	Yeah, I took the cord out. You want to give me my mic back? Please give me my mic back, please.
260560	264480	Please, young lady. Thank you. Thank you. Have a good day, okay? You're not stronger than me,
264480	266880	all right? God bless you. She just wants to steal the mic?
266880	270320	Hey, officer. This young lady, she's trying to rip my stuff up.
270320	273600	Oh, I'm assaulting her. She's assaulted. She's taking his stuff.
273600	275200	Come here. I have it on video.
275200	276240	Yeah. I'm assaulting her.
276240	278000	Yes. Yeah, dude, like, leave.
278800	280640	Yeah. Let go of my stuff.
280640	284480	Okay, if I get arrested right now, I would literally lash out.
284480	286720	You're literally going to lash out? Oh, my God.
290160	292480	Like, what the fuck, Lee? Just let go of the mic.
293600	295040	We get it. You don't agree? Just let go of the mic.
297440	299840	Walk away right now. I already said I was going to let it go.
305680	308320	Can I get my stuff? Can I get my stuff, ma'am?
308320	309200	She's going to get arrested.
311520	313040	Can I ask a question? Of course.
313040	315440	But let go right now. Let go right now.
315440	316880	Yes or no? Let go right now.
316880	318000	Yes, no. Yes or no?
318000	318960	You're under arrest.
318960	319760	Yep. That's what you get.
319760	321680	Put your hands behind you.
321680	323280	We pray for the grace of God for you.
323280	328320	Wow. Like, that was over nothing, guys.
329120	330480	She could have just walked.
331040	333040	Yeah, okay. They disagree and all that.
333040	335600	I know she went up there trying to be edgy as fuck,
335600	338560	and she thought that she would get these Christians all mad and triggered,
338560	340800	and they weren't, and they simply said, we'll pray for you.
340800	344800	And then she got mad that they weren't getting mad, and she got herself arrested.
345440	348560	Like, it's stupid. It's fucking stupidity.
348560	351040	I'm ultimately pro-choice, and this is still fucking stupid.
351040	352160	This isn't how you do it, man.
354240	356080	Oh, man, that's beautiful, isn't it?
356080	357280	Going to Indian Hogwarts.
360480	361440	iPhone 14.
367280	371040	That's why you gotta wear, like, a wrist strap or something on your phone, dude.
371040	372800	Especially if you're in the third world.
372800	374240	Jesus. I wonder if that was staged.
374240	375120	That might have been staged.
375120	377440	It was, like, too good to be true, but I don't know.
377440	378240	Probably wasn't.
378240	381440	My belief is that we should be centering the voices and experiences
381440	384480	of the most marginalized people and communities at all times.
384480	387200	So when I think about what fat liberation looks like to me,
387200	391520	it looks like centering the voices and experiences of those who live in
391520	395280	and who maneuver through spaces and institutions in a fat body.
395280	399600	It looks like making accessible spaces and having conversations that are aware
399600	405120	of the fact that people have different bodies and that they are interacting with space and people
405120	408000	and institutions and communities in a different way.
408000	411360	Fat liberation looks like fully embracing those differences
411360	414240	and having those conversations instead of shying away from them.
414240	420160	To learn more about fat liberation and the campaign for size freedom that Dove is supporting,
420160	422560	visit dove.com forward slash size freedom.
422560	423120	Well, wait a minute.
423120	425520	This is like, this is sponsored by Dove?
425520	427680	This is important and we should all be talking about it.
427680	429360	I guess it makes sense, doesn't it?
429360	431680	If you're fatter, you have more total skin.
431680	433920	So therefore you need to use up more of their soap.
433920	436560	This is like a good, this is a good, this is a good,
437360	439200	this is a good business decision for them.
439200	439440	Okay.
439440	440320	I got to rewatch some of that.
440320	440960	Give me a second here.
440960	443440	So when I think about what fat liberation looks like to me,
443440	448000	it looks like centering the voices and the experiences of those who live in
448000	449840	and who maneuver through spaces.
449840	451840	I don't know what spaces you're maneuvering through,
451840	453840	but it's probably a pretty tight squeeze.
453840	454400	Isn't it?
454400	455360	Haha.
455360	455600	Yeah.
455600	455920	That's it.
455920	457280	I just wanted to rewatch for a joke.
457280	461040	I finally cracked the code for permanently staying in the honeymoon phase with your partner.
461040	461360	Awesome.
461360	465120	Before you think that's not possible, I can be gone for 15 minutes and this man will greet
465120	466320	me like I've been gone for a week.
466320	469040	There's not one time I've said, Hey, I really feel like a walk.
469040	471040	And he's been like, nah, I'd rather stay home.
471040	474640	And no matter how mad we may be at each other, we always sleep in the same bed.
474640	476000	Isn't that right?
476000	477440	It's a fucking dog.
477440	478080	I knew it.
478960	479840	Get a dog.
479840	481120	Dog pill, guys.
481120	482480	You cannot escape it.
482480	486080	As soon as she said going for walks, I was like, this is, it's going to be dog pill,
486080	486400	isn't it?
486400	486900	Fuck.
488080	488960	Then what is Mexico?
488960	491120	What is this weird video we're watching?
491120	492240	Is Mexico a continent?
492240	493120	Hold the time out.
493120	494000	Oh my God.
494400	495600	This is the world.
495600	496080	Mexico.
496080	496480	Yeah.
496480	497040	Okay.
497040	499040	See each of these large masses.
499760	501040	How many do you count?
501040	504320	One, two, three, four, five.
504320	504880	Right.
504880	508320	However, this right here, Oh no, down here.
508320	510880	Where's the city and what's the county?
512320	516160	She's already telling you it's not on here right now.
516160	517760	How dumb are these kids?
518960	519760	What about Greenland?
519760	520320	Are there seven?
520320	521280	I thought it was seven.
522240	522800	It's seven.
523600	524640	Even the teacher doesn't know.
530720	533840	Oh, oh, oh, oh my God.
533840	534080	Okay.
534080	536240	This is actually like unlocking a few memories for me.
536240	538320	I know everyone looks at videos like these and they're like,
538320	540800	Oh, the zoomers are uniquely stupid or something or like,
540800	542640	Oh, there's so many like terrible teachers.
543440	547280	I'm thinking back now I went to, uh, to grade school in the nineties.
547280	549360	There were some pretty dumb fucking kids.
549360	551040	I know these, I think the kids are high school, right?
551120	553520	Even in high school, there were some pretty dumb fucking kids.
553520	554000	Yeah, man.
554000	558080	I remember, I'm remembering now, like sitting in like various geography
558080	563520	classes in like grade three or something and kids not understanding what maps were.
563520	565680	Maybe it was because I played video games, you know?
565680	569920	I was really young, really young playing Super Nintendo games that like my, um,
569920	572720	that I think were my dad's old games or something, you know?
572720	575360	Link to the past, you hit select, you pull the map and it's like,
575360	576560	Oh, you get it.
576560	578800	Like when you're playing a game because you care about the game.
578800	581440	So when I get to school and it's like, here's how maps were children.
581440	582480	I was like, yeah, I already got this shit.
582480	584720	And you know, being like seven years old or something, just slap it down.
584720	584800	Yeah.
584800	585680	Here's what the city is here.
585680	586320	Here's the road.
586320	588000	And the kids are like, whoa, whoa.
588000	588160	Yeah.
588160	591840	I'm not sure that like zoomers, keep in mind, this is high school now, not grade
591840	592240	school, right?
592240	595200	But even in high school, there were kids who still didn't know what maps were when
595200	595840	I was there.
595840	599840	Maybe zoomers are uniquely stupid or maybe we're just capturing more of their
599840	601040	stupidity with smartphones.
601040	601440	Who knows?
602000	603360	Either way, it's disheartening to watch.
603360	606880	It was really bad because I was like, I felt so bad about it.
606880	608000	What is its quality?
608400	612320	I called like child services on this one.
614000	617360	I called child services on my ex because he pissed me off.
617360	619440	And then I was like, yeah, I'm done with this person, whatever.
619440	624320	Like, you know, cheater, fucking piece of shit, lies, bullshit.
624320	625600	He had kids.
625600	634480	I called child services on his ass and I like fabricated everything and like
634720	638400	said certain things and they like went to the door and like there was a whole
638400	639280	process.
639280	642880	Like, I don't even know if the children's aid worker still visits them, but she
642880	646880	probably does because what I said, like the way I AI'd that shit, you know, like
646880	650240	real AI shit, like fake bruises.
651120	652560	Oh my God.
652560	653760	Be careful, fellas.
653760	654320	Yeah.
654320	656240	Yeah, pretty crazy.
656240	658080	What a terrible fucking person.
658080	660000	And then you just made like an exaggeration story.
660000	661840	And on their kid, on his kids.
662400	662880	Yeah.
662880	664720	Like, so like, yeah, then they came.
664720	665600	What a piece of shit.
666480	667360	They're both pieces of shit.
667360	669920	She actually cheated, but your kids are being abused.
670640	672160	You know, you could lose your kids.
673520	674880	This fucking sociopath.
678480	680240	Yeah, should have been nicer to me, bitch.
680960	681360	Wow.
682000	682720	Oh, okay.
682720	685520	I'm, I'm, I'm done with TikTok Tuesday for today.
685520	687200	Holy fuck.
687200	690560	That was, uh, that was like a hardcore black pill.
690800	693520	That black pill was darker than her fake fucking tan.
693520	693840	All right.
693840	694720	That's enough of this guys.
694720	695920	Let's get the fuck out of here.
695920	700000	All right, listen, if you're watching this on release, uh, I'm streaming right
700000	701920	after this gets uploaded.
701920	702160	Okay.
702800	705520	So drop in, say hi.
705520	707760	If you don't, you're not a real dev fan.
707760	710880	If you don't, uh, I'll call protective services.
710880	711440	Okay.
711440	714560	In all seriousness, I'm going to go, I am streaming tonight.
714560	715520	Drop in and say hi.
715520	718560	I'm playing some, uh, some more of that sea of stars game with my friends.
718560	720000	And, uh, thanks for being here guys.
720000	720960	I'll see you next time.
