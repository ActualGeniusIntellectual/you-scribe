1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Well, that's it. They nicked the new Twitter account, guys. I hadn't even posted on it

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,520
yet. I guess I'm on a watchlist now or something. I've come back from the dead too many times.

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,600
But you know what? It's Twitter. Accounts are a dime a dozen. I'm sure if I cool off

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,320
for a couple months, come back, it'll be okay. And while prepping for this video, I realized

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,920
just how annoying it is to surf Twitter or try to get news from Twitter without having

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,120
an account. Like here, I'm on Lilith's account, right? We'll just scroll down a bit. Look

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,160
what happens. See more tweets from Lilith. Love it. Well, I would love to sign in. But

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,700
actually I realized a really interesting thing you can do. I installed uBlock Origin. You

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,160
got the element zapper. You zap the box. You zap the clear coat. And then you can scroll

10
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,040
again, no problem. And if you want to interact with anything, then you just zap this layer

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,140
that's bugging you and you can click on things. No problem. Again, Twitter becomes normal

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,620
and usable. Anyway, we all know about libs at TikTok at this point, right? I've done

13
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,440
a few videos on them. I think you guys know my opinion at this point. They're clearly

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,360
a biased source of information, but they are still a source of information. The things

15
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,500
that they show off, like another kids at drag event or a second grade teacher who's explaining

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,840
a workaround that they use to discuss gender ideology with students. Sometimes these captions

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,040
are a bit hyperbolic, but they are posting real pictures and real videos made by real

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,800
people who do seem to be doing some shady stuff. So clearly libs of TikTok has an ideological

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,520
bent. It's in the name, but she's still a reasonable source of information. You just

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,860
have to go in there with that in mind. She's reporting on things that are really happening,

21
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,440
but she herself is biased. And there's the obvious problem of the spotlight effect where

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,660
she is only showing you things that are good for her side. And that's fair enough. I consider

23
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,580
myself to be independently minded enough that I can look at what she's talking about,

24
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,300
notice that it might be a problem, but still not accept it as if this is the prevailing

25
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,340
narrative because it's not, it's only one narrative, but there is a counterpart to libs

26
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:09,980
of TikTok, someone who is just as partisan, but on the other side, and that is chuds of

27
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:16,300
TikTok. It's quite the name, you know, considering how often the word chud is memed. I thought

28
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,220
the left would have grown out of using it by now because it's, it's dunked on so much,

29
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,380
but I mean, I saw Adam and Sitch yesterday. I'm recording this on Monday. I saw Adam and

30
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,780
Sitch yesterday and they were doing like a, a teardown of Xander Hall's attack on mauler

31
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,680
and Xander Hall was like, chuds, chuds, chuds, like Jesus Christ, dude, 2015 wants their

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,620
terminology back. Fuck. But here we are. This is the inverse from a leftist perspective.

33
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,820
Looking at the right, we've got chuds of TikTok. And in fact, the icon looks kind of similar.

34
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,420
You know, like you look at libs of TikTok, it's got like the gender, the gender nonconformity

35
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,380
symbol. You look at chuds of TikTok, it's got QAnon. It's like, okay, I can appreciate

36
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,620
that. They're going for the same kind of memes. And on chuds of TikTok, you will find

37
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,660
things that are pretty much the inverse of libs of TikTok. The stuff they say is true.

38
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,620
They don't make anything up, but they add their own specifically lefty spin to it. And

39
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,100
they only report on things that suits their narrative. So in my opinion, you take libs

40
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:14,180
of TikTok, you take chuds of TikTok, you smash them together. You, you absorb real happenings

41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,300
from both positions and you probably get some semblance of what the truth is. Here's a Q

42
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:25,300
anon casualty story. A man in Michigan shot and killed his wife and dog injuring his daughter

43
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,580
who's now in the hospital. Also firing at police responders who killed him in the shootout.

44
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,820
He reportedly, according to a Reddit post, had severe QAnon delusions that started after

45
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,580
the 2020 election. Yep, the internet ruined him. Growing up, my parents were extremely

46
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,180
loving happy people. I always had a special bond with both my parents. In 2020 after Trump

47
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,420
lost, my dad started going down the QAnon rabbit hole. He kept reading conspiracy theories

48
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,540
about the election stolen, Trump, vaccines, et cetera. He always said he wanted to keep

49
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,500
us safe and healthy. It kept getting worse and he verbally snapped at us a few times.

50
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,580
Nothing physical though. He never got physical with anyone. Well, at around 4am on September

51
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,380
11th, he had an argument with my mother. He decided to take our guns and shoot her, my

52
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,860
dog and my sister. My mother succumbed to her wounds and my sister is in the hospital

53
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,060
right now. My dad also fired back at the cops and they killed him. I'm shocked. I don't

54
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,100
even know what to say. Fuck you QAnon. I hope the FBI tightens its grip on you and that

55
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,460
your lackeys rot in prison. Jesus, that's wild, man. I know that some of the rightoids

56
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,280
who watch my channel sometimes get a bit triggered by this, but there are some legitimate crazies

57
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,520
on your side, dude. You can't fucking deny. Man compares his struggles as a mega to what

58
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,740
happened to the Jews in the Holocaust. Thursday's speech from Biden. Jesus Christ, two minutes,

59
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,020
37 seconds. I thought that TikTok was known for its brevity. All right, let's see what

60
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:50,980
is going on here. And this sounds awful familiar for me. Very familiar. If you don't see it,

61
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,340
I don't think you ever will see it. And I posted a video on this before. I did the video,

62
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,800
I did the tubcast with Lilith and I did my own video. People are complaining about that

63
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,140
one. That's fine. It's not that I don't see it, it's that I don't agree with you. And

64
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,020
Lord have mercy on our souls for those that don't see it.

65
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:17,180
Dad, you're never going to believe it. Hitler just won the election and he's blaming us.

66
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,700
Is he doing anything? Okay, right.

67
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,900
The Jews for all the problems in the country. Oh, don't be silly. Those politicians will

68
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:32,740
say anything to get elected. Dad, did you see the new Nazi newspaper? It's spreading

69
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:39,940
lies and some terrible things about it. Jesus Christ, he does this for like 10 years. Okay,

70
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,700
maybe I get the point. They're going to show the escalation. You don't want to watch all

71
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,700
this for this video.

72
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,140
Turn this down here again. Your mother and I are going anywhere.

73
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:55,780
All right, dude. Do you see the correlation here? Do you see where two and two is going

74
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,140
together? All you got to do is just change one thing to the other. You don't see it?

75
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,260
No, I don't. And here's the reason why I don't see it.

76
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,100
Anyone can be persecuted, but the linchpin is are you being persecuted for a legitimate reason

77
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,060
or not? It probably doesn't need to be said, but the Jews in Germany weren't persecuted for a

78
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,180
legitimate reason. Are mega people being persecuted for a legitimate reason? That's going to depend

79
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,380
on your point of view. If you believe that the election was stolen from you, then no,

80
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,140
you're freedom fighters. However, if you believe that the election wasn't stolen,

81
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,540
now you are illegitimately usurping a democratic process. And that's dangerous. You know,

82
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,420
this is the crux of the whole one man's terrorist, another man's freedom fighter situation. Just

83
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,500
because you are being targeted does not automatically make you a victim in the same

84
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:46,340
way that criminals are not victims. It's more complicated than that. Moreover, let's see if

85
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,820
what's happening in this video is actually happening to mega people. Hold on. Okay, hold on.

86
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,260
Let's see. Let's see. Dad, did you see the new Nazi newspaper? It's spreading lies and saying

87
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,460
terrible things about us. Okay. It might be the case, assuming that you're correct,

88
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,180
that everything Biden said about you is a lie. Okay. I'll give you that one, even though I don't

89
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,020
agree. We're not allowed to have gatherings anymore and they're passing anti-Jewish laws

90
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:19,300
in parliament. Okay. So are they cracking down on mega gatherings? You can make a joke about

91
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:26,660
COVID all you want, but gatherings specifically for the purposes of discussing or spreading the

92
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,700
mega point of view. I just saw a Trump rally yesterday. What are you guys talking about?

93
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,780
I think this analogy kind of falls apart. And frankly, I think Mr. Meth addict here might just

94
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,500
be a bit of a snowflake who really wants to reap some of that victimhood power that the left has

95
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,060
been getting high on for the past decade. So yeah, I would agree with Chet's TikTok here. This is

96
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,620
pretty low worthy. I didn't threaten anybody proceeds to make a vague threat about fighting

97
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,860
the government. Now you're really starting to piss me off because now I'm being contacted by

98
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,860
people that I've never met before telling me that I need to be worried about the things that come

99
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,620
out of my mouth and the content of my videos, not on this platform, but social media platforms.

100
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,820
Well, I got something to say to you. You can suck a whole fucking nest of bird dicks.

101
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:16,020
You want to know why? Because freedom of speech is freedom of speech. I haven't threatened anybody

102
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,820
come on my fucking land and see what a threat is. But you guys, on the other hand, your presidential

103
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:29,060
fucking overreaching powers and your bullshit fucking policies that you've enforced, that is

104
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,140
a clear declaration of war on the people of this country and a people across this planet.

105
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,380
So my big question that I have for you is who gets to hold you accountable when all the blood

106
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:47,140
gets fucking spilt on the ground? Huh? Who holds you accountable? We'll see in the near future.

107
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:56,020
Okay. We'll see in the near future. That was the moment when it tipped from angry libertarian

108
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,420
into actual threat, at least as the tweet says a vague threat. So it's like, I didn't threaten

109
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,700
anybody by the way, when the feds come to my house, I'm going to have my AR 15 primed and

110
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,140
ready. Jesus Christ. Dudes, you ain't kicking anyone's ass. Is that supposed to be asses?

111
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,940
Okay. Dudes, you ain't kicking anyone's assess anytime soon.

112
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:25,060
Hey, those photographs are the UN forces in the United States. All I gotta say is,

113
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,780
dudes, our ancestors kicked the British off this country twice.

114
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,260
Jesus. Where are you recording this?

115
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:41,300
You're here under behalf of sloppy Joe. All I gotta say, I think I'm speaking for all Americans.

116
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:48,260
Bring it. We'll kick your asses out of here. And you might have a little friend going with you.

117
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:57,860
United not heads does not scare Americans. Hell, you can't scare people in foreign countries.

118
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:06,340
You think you can come here and intimidate us. All right. All right. Solid patriotic sentiments

119
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,020
from our drunk uncle over here. I'm not exactly sure what he's talking about. I don't, I didn't,

120
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,780
I didn't recognize whatever he was referencing, but the rest of the message, it wasn't, wasn't

121
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,300
all that objectionable. To be honest, he's just kind of a redneck. It's like, whatever

122
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,020
something tells me they're more upset about race and not the fact that live action Disney

123
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,060
remakes have been awful. Okay. Let's see. This is a quartering video accounts like this.

124
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,860
They always go after the quartering because Jeremy is kind of a big fish on YouTube when

125
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,700
it comes to this, this area of the internet at this point. And if they can shut up an

126
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,020
anti woke advocate with over a million subs, they'll consider it a massive victory. So

127
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,100
the locust backfire in history, Disney demolished over the little mermaid in the recent little

128
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,900
mermaid remake. They made Ariel black because all of the gingers are becoming black people.

129
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,740
That's just how it is in the modern era. And let's see some of these comments that apparently

130
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,340
are about race or a racist replacement isn't inclusion. It's a blatant racism to hate the

131
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,740
people who created something cool, but at the same time, desire to take everything they created as

132
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,380
yours to compensate for your own. I get his point. That's not really a racist comment. I will

133
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,740
disagree with his first sentence though. Inclusion is replacement. If there's a fixed, finite number

134
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:18,420
of spots, if you have say 10 spots and 10 white people, and then you boot out one of the white

135
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,180
people to put in a black person, well, you've made things more inclusive and more diverse,

136
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,740
but you've also replaced one white person. Now you can argue whether or not that's morally

137
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,260
justified. It might actually be depending what we're talking about, but it's still

138
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,940
replacement. Let's see here. If they race changed Ariel, we should demand that they

139
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,340
change the race of black Panthers. Someone like Ben Affleck in the next movie keeps this equal

140
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,580
all across the board. I mean, yeah, fair enough. Doesn't bother me. My favorite part is when the

141
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,580
race swapped character said it's race swap in time and race swap the entire theater,

142
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,340
truly one of the Disney movies of all time. That's that's just the Morbius meme. Here's

143
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,260
what's going on here that doesn't seem to understand. I can't speak for all commenters.

144
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,380
I certainly can't speak for Jeremy, but I can speak for myself and I can speak for a lot of

145
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,500
people that I know what's going on here is that people don't really care too much about the race

146
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,260
swapped thing. Like, yeah, it's cringe. Like, you know, the little mermaid isn't isn't a black

147
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,060
person. You know, this is specifically a European folk tale and therefore it is proper to put a

148
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,540
European in the role. You wouldn't take an African folk tale and put a white person in that role,

149
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,300
obviously, or maybe you would, maybe it should go both ways. I don't know. But whatever ethic

150
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,380
that we're appealing to, we should be using it across the board. What's actually happening here,

151
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,300
though, the more important conversation, all of this media that's coming out right now,

152
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,460
they're they're trash. That's the whole point of my Lord of the Rings series with with Arch and

153
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,380
Kibbs and Lilith. That's the whole point of like, it's a Gundam and Mauler and guys like that

154
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,620
talking about She-Hulk. All these shows and movies coming out, they're pure garbage. And what they're

155
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,140
doing is they're presenting the fact that they have people of color in lead roles as defense as

156
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:48,580
to why they're garbage. Like, well, you can't criticize our terrible show now or our terrible

157
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,780
movie because there's a black woman, a strong and proud and beautiful black woman in the lead.

158
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:59,940
So if you criticize us, you're racist. The true race conversation here is how the Corpos are using

159
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:06,260
race as a shield for the declining quality of their products and their profit extraction schemes.

160
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:11,700
And leftoids are running defense for them, even as they claim to be socialist and whatever else.

161
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,500
They will soy the fuck out at this shit. That's what's going on here. But that doesn't really

162
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,060
fit Chud's of TikTok's narrative. So that's going over her head. I'm assuming it's a her just like

163
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,700
just like Liv's a TikTok is. The communists are trying to take over the world and you're on TikTok?

164
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:38,100
They spent the better part of 70 years setting this shit up. 102 year movement of the Communist

165
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:44,500
Party. Complete world domination. You guys really think that we're going to win this battle

166
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,780
sitting here on TikTok? You guys really think that? You guys think that we're going to win

167
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:55,860
this war without a single shot fired? The indoctrination worked on you too.

168
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,820
Glow posting aside, let's let's take her at face value, OK? And this just isn't some fed.

169
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,140
All right. What exactly is Chud's of TikTok complaining about? We hear this rhetoric all

170
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,140
the time from the left. Fascists are everywhere. Fascists are in the government. Everyone's a

171
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,780
fascist. We need to rise up and overthrow the system. We can't rely on democracy anymore.

172
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,940
Electoralism is what destroys our movement. We need direct action. We need to get in the streets.

173
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,500
We need to riot. We need to throw bricks through windows. Libs get the bullet to overthrow this

174
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,420
oppressive capitalist system. You hear this from the left all the time. In fact, I would argue

175
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:34,740
insofar as the mainstream posting on the Internet, you hear a lot more calls to violence from the

176
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,180
left than the right. I would argue insofar as the right calls to violence. There are revolutionary

177
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,780
rightists out there. There are like neo reactionaries, other crazy people, but they're

178
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,860
kind of relegated to their own very tiny corners of the Internet because our society is very

179
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,700
sensitive to right wing calls to violence, but not so much left wing ones. There's always a new riot.

180
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,780
There's always some new figurehead calling for an overthrow of the capitalist system,

181
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,100
which is why you'll see something like this. If you're an anarchist, anti-fascist, Marxist

182
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,700
organization that does mutual aid, protests, local organizing, helping the unhoused or low income,

183
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,140
please DM me for promoting events and retweet this so I can reach out to groups across the

184
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:17,460
nation. Okay, so they want to do the mutual aid thing. They are explicitly and openly leftist

185
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:23,220
revolutionaries against the liberal capitalist state. This is farther to the left than Libs of

186
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,940
TikTok goes in the right. You don't see Libs of TikTok posting. If you're like a revolutionary

187
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,660
Christian nationalist or a fascist or something, DM me and we'll start organizing for our violent

188
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:38,260
uprising. You don't hear that come out of Libs of TikTok. Now, who knows if the person behind

189
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,500
Libs of TikTok really is that extreme? I'm sure at least some of the people following them are,

190
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:49,060
but the point is they don't openly say it. And that is, at least by this metric, what makes

191
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,700
Chuds of TikTok a bit more yikes-y, in my opinion. However, as you scroll through Chuds of TikTok,

192
00:15:53,700 --> 00:16:00,340
you begin to see very similar types of content. You'll see videos and clips from YouTubers and

193
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,940
from TV. You'll see articles. You'll see TikTok videos from right-leaning TikTok accounts.

194
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,500
It's all the same kind of thing that Libs of TikTok does. It really is the mirror inverse.

195
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,260
And as I scroll through, I'm realizing like, yeah, there are some crazy fucking people

196
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:21,300
on TikTok, you know? Joe Biden said that we need F-15s in order to defeat this government.

197
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,780
Well, I got some news for you. Those F-15s belong to us. We'll just go and fucking take them.

198
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:34,100
Tread lightly, Joe. Tread fucking lightly. Like, Jesus Christ, dude, that's a bit ridiculous,

199
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,020
isn't it? You really think that you're going to be able to walk onto a military base and not get

200
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:43,780
blown the fuck up? Go ahead and try. Fuck. Like, there are some dumb people on TikTok,

201
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,100
but that just seems to be TikTok's thing. Everyone just seems to be a retard. You got left-leaning

202
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,820
retards. You got right-leaning retards. It's just a whole platform full of retards. And frankly,

203
00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:00,420
I'm happy for chuds of TikTok's existence. They are just as disgustingly partisan as Libs of

204
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:06,420
TikTok. But you know what? They both serve their purpose. They both present real people and they

205
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,220
both refuse to present anything that might refute their position. So you got to go into it with an

206
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,780
open mind. But fundamentally, they both have a place in the ecosystem to extreme places,

207
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,980
but nonetheless, legitimate places. And if I were on Twitter, I'd follow them both and just kind of

208
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,540
balance it out because yeah, man, there are crazies everywhere. And it's important to see

209
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,820
all the crazies everywhere, but it's also important to understand that that's not everyone.

210
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,180
That's not even the majority of people. So anyway, this is more of an off the cuff video.

211
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,540
I figured I'd just talk about chuds of TikTok for a while. And that was, you know,

212
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,620
a fun little bit of time. I will see you guys next time. I love you.
