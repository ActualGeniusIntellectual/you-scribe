WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.440
Well, that's it. They nicked the new Twitter account, guys. I hadn't even posted on it

00:10.440 --> 00:15.520
yet. I guess I'm on a watchlist now or something. I've come back from the dead too many times.

00:15.520 --> 00:20.600
But you know what? It's Twitter. Accounts are a dime a dozen. I'm sure if I cool off

00:20.600 --> 00:26.320
for a couple months, come back, it'll be okay. And while prepping for this video, I realized

00:26.320 --> 00:29.920
just how annoying it is to surf Twitter or try to get news from Twitter without having

00:29.920 --> 00:34.120
an account. Like here, I'm on Lilith's account, right? We'll just scroll down a bit. Look

00:34.120 --> 00:40.160
what happens. See more tweets from Lilith. Love it. Well, I would love to sign in. But

00:40.160 --> 00:43.700
actually I realized a really interesting thing you can do. I installed uBlock Origin. You

00:43.700 --> 00:49.160
got the element zapper. You zap the box. You zap the clear coat. And then you can scroll

00:49.160 --> 00:55.040
again, no problem. And if you want to interact with anything, then you just zap this layer

00:55.040 --> 00:59.140
that's bugging you and you can click on things. No problem. Again, Twitter becomes normal

00:59.140 --> 01:03.620
and usable. Anyway, we all know about libs at TikTok at this point, right? I've done

01:03.620 --> 01:07.440
a few videos on them. I think you guys know my opinion at this point. They're clearly

01:07.440 --> 01:11.360
a biased source of information, but they are still a source of information. The things

01:11.360 --> 01:17.500
that they show off, like another kids at drag event or a second grade teacher who's explaining

01:17.500 --> 01:22.840
a workaround that they use to discuss gender ideology with students. Sometimes these captions

01:22.840 --> 01:29.040
are a bit hyperbolic, but they are posting real pictures and real videos made by real

01:29.040 --> 01:34.800
people who do seem to be doing some shady stuff. So clearly libs of TikTok has an ideological

01:34.800 --> 01:39.520
bent. It's in the name, but she's still a reasonable source of information. You just

01:39.520 --> 01:42.860
have to go in there with that in mind. She's reporting on things that are really happening,

01:42.860 --> 01:46.440
but she herself is biased. And there's the obvious problem of the spotlight effect where

01:46.440 --> 01:50.660
she is only showing you things that are good for her side. And that's fair enough. I consider

01:50.660 --> 01:55.580
myself to be independently minded enough that I can look at what she's talking about,

01:55.580 --> 01:59.300
notice that it might be a problem, but still not accept it as if this is the prevailing

01:59.300 --> 02:03.340
narrative because it's not, it's only one narrative, but there is a counterpart to libs

02:03.340 --> 02:09.980
of TikTok, someone who is just as partisan, but on the other side, and that is chuds of

02:09.980 --> 02:16.300
TikTok. It's quite the name, you know, considering how often the word chud is memed. I thought

02:16.300 --> 02:20.220
the left would have grown out of using it by now because it's, it's dunked on so much,

02:20.260 --> 02:24.380
but I mean, I saw Adam and Sitch yesterday. I'm recording this on Monday. I saw Adam and

02:24.380 --> 02:29.780
Sitch yesterday and they were doing like a, a teardown of Xander Hall's attack on mauler

02:29.780 --> 02:33.680
and Xander Hall was like, chuds, chuds, chuds, like Jesus Christ, dude, 2015 wants their

02:33.680 --> 02:37.620
terminology back. Fuck. But here we are. This is the inverse from a leftist perspective.

02:37.620 --> 02:41.820
Looking at the right, we've got chuds of TikTok. And in fact, the icon looks kind of similar.

02:41.820 --> 02:45.420
You know, like you look at libs of TikTok, it's got like the gender, the gender nonconformity

02:45.420 --> 02:49.380
symbol. You look at chuds of TikTok, it's got QAnon. It's like, okay, I can appreciate

02:49.380 --> 02:53.620
that. They're going for the same kind of memes. And on chuds of TikTok, you will find

02:53.620 --> 02:58.660
things that are pretty much the inverse of libs of TikTok. The stuff they say is true.

02:58.660 --> 03:03.620
They don't make anything up, but they add their own specifically lefty spin to it. And

03:03.620 --> 03:08.100
they only report on things that suits their narrative. So in my opinion, you take libs

03:08.100 --> 03:14.180
of TikTok, you take chuds of TikTok, you smash them together. You, you absorb real happenings

03:14.180 --> 03:19.300
from both positions and you probably get some semblance of what the truth is. Here's a Q

03:19.300 --> 03:25.300
anon casualty story. A man in Michigan shot and killed his wife and dog injuring his daughter

03:25.300 --> 03:30.580
who's now in the hospital. Also firing at police responders who killed him in the shootout.

03:30.580 --> 03:35.820
He reportedly, according to a Reddit post, had severe QAnon delusions that started after

03:35.820 --> 03:40.580
the 2020 election. Yep, the internet ruined him. Growing up, my parents were extremely

03:40.580 --> 03:44.180
loving happy people. I always had a special bond with both my parents. In 2020 after Trump

03:44.180 --> 03:48.420
lost, my dad started going down the QAnon rabbit hole. He kept reading conspiracy theories

03:48.420 --> 03:52.540
about the election stolen, Trump, vaccines, et cetera. He always said he wanted to keep

03:52.540 --> 03:56.500
us safe and healthy. It kept getting worse and he verbally snapped at us a few times.

03:56.500 --> 04:00.580
Nothing physical though. He never got physical with anyone. Well, at around 4am on September

04:00.580 --> 04:04.380
11th, he had an argument with my mother. He decided to take our guns and shoot her, my

04:04.380 --> 04:07.860
dog and my sister. My mother succumbed to her wounds and my sister is in the hospital

04:07.860 --> 04:12.060
right now. My dad also fired back at the cops and they killed him. I'm shocked. I don't

04:12.060 --> 04:16.100
even know what to say. Fuck you QAnon. I hope the FBI tightens its grip on you and that

04:16.100 --> 04:21.460
your lackeys rot in prison. Jesus, that's wild, man. I know that some of the rightoids

04:21.460 --> 04:26.280
who watch my channel sometimes get a bit triggered by this, but there are some legitimate crazies

04:26.280 --> 04:31.520
on your side, dude. You can't fucking deny. Man compares his struggles as a mega to what

04:31.520 --> 04:37.740
happened to the Jews in the Holocaust. Thursday's speech from Biden. Jesus Christ, two minutes,

04:37.740 --> 04:42.020
37 seconds. I thought that TikTok was known for its brevity. All right, let's see what

04:42.020 --> 04:50.980
is going on here. And this sounds awful familiar for me. Very familiar. If you don't see it,

04:50.980 --> 04:55.340
I don't think you ever will see it. And I posted a video on this before. I did the video,

04:55.340 --> 05:00.800
I did the tubcast with Lilith and I did my own video. People are complaining about that

05:00.800 --> 05:05.140
one. That's fine. It's not that I don't see it, it's that I don't agree with you. And

05:05.140 --> 05:08.020
Lord have mercy on our souls for those that don't see it.

05:08.020 --> 05:17.180
Dad, you're never going to believe it. Hitler just won the election and he's blaming us.

05:17.180 --> 05:19.700
Is he doing anything? Okay, right.

05:19.700 --> 05:24.900
The Jews for all the problems in the country. Oh, don't be silly. Those politicians will

05:24.900 --> 05:32.740
say anything to get elected. Dad, did you see the new Nazi newspaper? It's spreading

05:32.740 --> 05:39.940
lies and some terrible things about it. Jesus Christ, he does this for like 10 years. Okay,

05:39.940 --> 05:43.700
maybe I get the point. They're going to show the escalation. You don't want to watch all

05:43.700 --> 05:44.700
this for this video.

05:44.700 --> 05:48.140
Turn this down here again. Your mother and I are going anywhere.

05:48.140 --> 05:55.780
All right, dude. Do you see the correlation here? Do you see where two and two is going

05:55.780 --> 06:01.140
together? All you got to do is just change one thing to the other. You don't see it?

06:01.540 --> 06:04.260
No, I don't. And here's the reason why I don't see it.

06:04.260 --> 06:10.100
Anyone can be persecuted, but the linchpin is are you being persecuted for a legitimate reason

06:10.100 --> 06:15.060
or not? It probably doesn't need to be said, but the Jews in Germany weren't persecuted for a

06:15.060 --> 06:20.180
legitimate reason. Are mega people being persecuted for a legitimate reason? That's going to depend

06:20.180 --> 06:23.380
on your point of view. If you believe that the election was stolen from you, then no,

06:23.380 --> 06:27.140
you're freedom fighters. However, if you believe that the election wasn't stolen,

06:27.140 --> 06:31.540
now you are illegitimately usurping a democratic process. And that's dangerous. You know,

06:31.540 --> 06:36.420
this is the crux of the whole one man's terrorist, another man's freedom fighter situation. Just

06:36.420 --> 06:40.500
because you are being targeted does not automatically make you a victim in the same

06:40.500 --> 06:46.340
way that criminals are not victims. It's more complicated than that. Moreover, let's see if

06:46.340 --> 06:50.820
what's happening in this video is actually happening to mega people. Hold on. Okay, hold on.

06:50.820 --> 06:56.260
Let's see. Let's see. Dad, did you see the new Nazi newspaper? It's spreading lies and saying

06:56.260 --> 07:01.460
terrible things about us. Okay. It might be the case, assuming that you're correct,

07:01.460 --> 07:06.180
that everything Biden said about you is a lie. Okay. I'll give you that one, even though I don't

07:06.180 --> 07:12.020
agree. We're not allowed to have gatherings anymore and they're passing anti-Jewish laws

07:12.020 --> 07:19.300
in parliament. Okay. So are they cracking down on mega gatherings? You can make a joke about

07:19.300 --> 07:26.660
COVID all you want, but gatherings specifically for the purposes of discussing or spreading the

07:26.660 --> 07:31.700
mega point of view. I just saw a Trump rally yesterday. What are you guys talking about?

07:32.900 --> 07:37.780
I think this analogy kind of falls apart. And frankly, I think Mr. Meth addict here might just

07:37.780 --> 07:42.500
be a bit of a snowflake who really wants to reap some of that victimhood power that the left has

07:42.500 --> 07:47.060
been getting high on for the past decade. So yeah, I would agree with Chet's TikTok here. This is

07:47.060 --> 07:51.620
pretty low worthy. I didn't threaten anybody proceeds to make a vague threat about fighting

07:51.620 --> 07:55.860
the government. Now you're really starting to piss me off because now I'm being contacted by

07:55.860 --> 07:59.860
people that I've never met before telling me that I need to be worried about the things that come

07:59.860 --> 08:05.620
out of my mouth and the content of my videos, not on this platform, but social media platforms.

08:05.620 --> 08:10.820
Well, I got something to say to you. You can suck a whole fucking nest of bird dicks.

08:10.820 --> 08:16.020
You want to know why? Because freedom of speech is freedom of speech. I haven't threatened anybody

08:16.740 --> 08:22.820
come on my fucking land and see what a threat is. But you guys, on the other hand, your presidential

08:22.820 --> 08:29.060
fucking overreaching powers and your bullshit fucking policies that you've enforced, that is

08:29.060 --> 08:33.140
a clear declaration of war on the people of this country and a people across this planet.

08:33.860 --> 08:39.380
So my big question that I have for you is who gets to hold you accountable when all the blood

08:39.380 --> 08:47.140
gets fucking spilt on the ground? Huh? Who holds you accountable? We'll see in the near future.

08:49.060 --> 08:56.020
Okay. We'll see in the near future. That was the moment when it tipped from angry libertarian

08:56.660 --> 09:02.420
into actual threat, at least as the tweet says a vague threat. So it's like, I didn't threaten

09:02.420 --> 09:07.700
anybody by the way, when the feds come to my house, I'm going to have my AR 15 primed and

09:07.700 --> 09:13.140
ready. Jesus Christ. Dudes, you ain't kicking anyone's ass. Is that supposed to be asses?

09:14.420 --> 09:17.940
Okay. Dudes, you ain't kicking anyone's assess anytime soon.

09:19.220 --> 09:25.060
Hey, those photographs are the UN forces in the United States. All I gotta say is,

09:25.060 --> 09:29.780
dudes, our ancestors kicked the British off this country twice.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.260
Jesus. Where are you recording this?

09:33.140 --> 09:41.300
You're here under behalf of sloppy Joe. All I gotta say, I think I'm speaking for all Americans.

09:42.180 --> 09:48.260
Bring it. We'll kick your asses out of here. And you might have a little friend going with you.

09:50.740 --> 09:57.860
United not heads does not scare Americans. Hell, you can't scare people in foreign countries.

09:58.820 --> 10:06.340
You think you can come here and intimidate us. All right. All right. Solid patriotic sentiments

10:06.340 --> 10:10.020
from our drunk uncle over here. I'm not exactly sure what he's talking about. I don't, I didn't,

10:10.020 --> 10:13.780
I didn't recognize whatever he was referencing, but the rest of the message, it wasn't, wasn't

10:13.780 --> 10:17.300
all that objectionable. To be honest, he's just kind of a redneck. It's like, whatever

10:17.300 --> 10:22.020
something tells me they're more upset about race and not the fact that live action Disney

10:22.020 --> 10:27.060
remakes have been awful. Okay. Let's see. This is a quartering video accounts like this.

10:27.060 --> 10:31.860
They always go after the quartering because Jeremy is kind of a big fish on YouTube when

10:31.860 --> 10:35.700
it comes to this, this area of the internet at this point. And if they can shut up an

10:35.700 --> 10:40.020
anti woke advocate with over a million subs, they'll consider it a massive victory. So

10:40.020 --> 10:44.100
the locust backfire in history, Disney demolished over the little mermaid in the recent little

10:44.100 --> 10:48.900
mermaid remake. They made Ariel black because all of the gingers are becoming black people.

10:48.900 --> 10:52.740
That's just how it is in the modern era. And let's see some of these comments that apparently

10:52.820 --> 10:58.340
are about race or a racist replacement isn't inclusion. It's a blatant racism to hate the

10:58.340 --> 11:02.740
people who created something cool, but at the same time, desire to take everything they created as

11:02.740 --> 11:07.380
yours to compensate for your own. I get his point. That's not really a racist comment. I will

11:07.380 --> 11:12.740
disagree with his first sentence though. Inclusion is replacement. If there's a fixed, finite number

11:12.740 --> 11:18.420
of spots, if you have say 10 spots and 10 white people, and then you boot out one of the white

11:18.420 --> 11:22.180
people to put in a black person, well, you've made things more inclusive and more diverse,

11:22.180 --> 11:26.740
but you've also replaced one white person. Now you can argue whether or not that's morally

11:26.740 --> 11:30.260
justified. It might actually be depending what we're talking about, but it's still

11:30.260 --> 11:33.940
replacement. Let's see here. If they race changed Ariel, we should demand that they

11:33.940 --> 11:38.340
change the race of black Panthers. Someone like Ben Affleck in the next movie keeps this equal

11:38.340 --> 11:42.580
all across the board. I mean, yeah, fair enough. Doesn't bother me. My favorite part is when the

11:42.580 --> 11:46.580
race swapped character said it's race swap in time and race swap the entire theater,

11:46.580 --> 11:50.340
truly one of the Disney movies of all time. That's that's just the Morbius meme. Here's

11:50.340 --> 11:54.260
what's going on here that doesn't seem to understand. I can't speak for all commenters.

11:54.260 --> 11:57.380
I certainly can't speak for Jeremy, but I can speak for myself and I can speak for a lot of

11:57.380 --> 12:02.500
people that I know what's going on here is that people don't really care too much about the race

12:02.500 --> 12:06.260
swapped thing. Like, yeah, it's cringe. Like, you know, the little mermaid isn't isn't a black

12:06.260 --> 12:11.060
person. You know, this is specifically a European folk tale and therefore it is proper to put a

12:11.060 --> 12:15.540
European in the role. You wouldn't take an African folk tale and put a white person in that role,

12:15.540 --> 12:19.300
obviously, or maybe you would, maybe it should go both ways. I don't know. But whatever ethic

12:19.300 --> 12:23.380
that we're appealing to, we should be using it across the board. What's actually happening here,

12:23.380 --> 12:27.300
though, the more important conversation, all of this media that's coming out right now,

12:27.300 --> 12:31.460
they're they're trash. That's the whole point of my Lord of the Rings series with with Arch and

12:31.460 --> 12:35.380
Kibbs and Lilith. That's the whole point of like, it's a Gundam and Mauler and guys like that

12:35.380 --> 12:39.620
talking about She-Hulk. All these shows and movies coming out, they're pure garbage. And what they're

12:39.620 --> 12:45.140
doing is they're presenting the fact that they have people of color in lead roles as defense as

12:45.140 --> 12:48.580
to why they're garbage. Like, well, you can't criticize our terrible show now or our terrible

12:48.580 --> 12:53.780
movie because there's a black woman, a strong and proud and beautiful black woman in the lead.

12:53.780 --> 12:59.940
So if you criticize us, you're racist. The true race conversation here is how the Corpos are using

12:59.940 --> 13:06.260
race as a shield for the declining quality of their products and their profit extraction schemes.

13:06.260 --> 13:11.700
And leftoids are running defense for them, even as they claim to be socialist and whatever else.

13:11.700 --> 13:16.500
They will soy the fuck out at this shit. That's what's going on here. But that doesn't really

13:16.500 --> 13:21.060
fit Chud's of TikTok's narrative. So that's going over her head. I'm assuming it's a her just like

13:21.060 --> 13:25.700
just like Liv's a TikTok is. The communists are trying to take over the world and you're on TikTok?

13:26.980 --> 13:38.100
They spent the better part of 70 years setting this shit up. 102 year movement of the Communist

13:38.100 --> 13:44.500
Party. Complete world domination. You guys really think that we're going to win this battle

13:45.060 --> 13:49.780
sitting here on TikTok? You guys really think that? You guys think that we're going to win

13:49.780 --> 13:55.860
this war without a single shot fired? The indoctrination worked on you too.

13:57.060 --> 14:02.820
Glow posting aside, let's let's take her at face value, OK? And this just isn't some fed.

14:02.820 --> 14:07.140
All right. What exactly is Chud's of TikTok complaining about? We hear this rhetoric all

14:07.140 --> 14:11.140
the time from the left. Fascists are everywhere. Fascists are in the government. Everyone's a

14:11.140 --> 14:15.780
fascist. We need to rise up and overthrow the system. We can't rely on democracy anymore.

14:15.780 --> 14:19.940
Electoralism is what destroys our movement. We need direct action. We need to get in the streets.

14:19.940 --> 14:24.500
We need to riot. We need to throw bricks through windows. Libs get the bullet to overthrow this

14:24.500 --> 14:28.420
oppressive capitalist system. You hear this from the left all the time. In fact, I would argue

14:28.420 --> 14:34.740
insofar as the mainstream posting on the Internet, you hear a lot more calls to violence from the

14:34.740 --> 14:40.180
left than the right. I would argue insofar as the right calls to violence. There are revolutionary

14:40.180 --> 14:43.780
rightists out there. There are like neo reactionaries, other crazy people, but they're

14:43.780 --> 14:47.860
kind of relegated to their own very tiny corners of the Internet because our society is very

14:47.860 --> 14:53.700
sensitive to right wing calls to violence, but not so much left wing ones. There's always a new riot.

14:53.700 --> 14:57.780
There's always some new figurehead calling for an overthrow of the capitalist system,

14:57.780 --> 15:02.100
which is why you'll see something like this. If you're an anarchist, anti-fascist, Marxist

15:02.100 --> 15:07.700
organization that does mutual aid, protests, local organizing, helping the unhoused or low income,

15:07.700 --> 15:11.140
please DM me for promoting events and retweet this so I can reach out to groups across the

15:11.140 --> 15:17.460
nation. Okay, so they want to do the mutual aid thing. They are explicitly and openly leftist

15:17.460 --> 15:23.220
revolutionaries against the liberal capitalist state. This is farther to the left than Libs of

15:23.220 --> 15:27.940
TikTok goes in the right. You don't see Libs of TikTok posting. If you're like a revolutionary

15:27.940 --> 15:32.660
Christian nationalist or a fascist or something, DM me and we'll start organizing for our violent

15:32.660 --> 15:38.260
uprising. You don't hear that come out of Libs of TikTok. Now, who knows if the person behind

15:38.260 --> 15:42.500
Libs of TikTok really is that extreme? I'm sure at least some of the people following them are,

15:42.500 --> 15:49.060
but the point is they don't openly say it. And that is, at least by this metric, what makes

15:49.060 --> 15:53.700
Chuds of TikTok a bit more yikes-y, in my opinion. However, as you scroll through Chuds of TikTok,

15:53.700 --> 16:00.340
you begin to see very similar types of content. You'll see videos and clips from YouTubers and

16:00.340 --> 16:05.940
from TV. You'll see articles. You'll see TikTok videos from right-leaning TikTok accounts.

16:05.940 --> 16:10.500
It's all the same kind of thing that Libs of TikTok does. It really is the mirror inverse.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.260
And as I scroll through, I'm realizing like, yeah, there are some crazy fucking people

16:14.900 --> 16:21.300
on TikTok, you know? Joe Biden said that we need F-15s in order to defeat this government.

16:21.300 --> 16:27.780
Well, I got some news for you. Those F-15s belong to us. We'll just go and fucking take them.

16:28.260 --> 16:34.100
Tread lightly, Joe. Tread fucking lightly. Like, Jesus Christ, dude, that's a bit ridiculous,

16:34.100 --> 16:38.020
isn't it? You really think that you're going to be able to walk onto a military base and not get

16:38.020 --> 16:43.780
blown the fuck up? Go ahead and try. Fuck. Like, there are some dumb people on TikTok,

16:43.780 --> 16:48.100
but that just seems to be TikTok's thing. Everyone just seems to be a retard. You got left-leaning

16:48.100 --> 16:52.820
retards. You got right-leaning retards. It's just a whole platform full of retards. And frankly,

16:53.780 --> 17:00.420
I'm happy for chuds of TikTok's existence. They are just as disgustingly partisan as Libs of

17:00.420 --> 17:06.420
TikTok. But you know what? They both serve their purpose. They both present real people and they

17:06.420 --> 17:11.220
both refuse to present anything that might refute their position. So you got to go into it with an

17:11.220 --> 17:15.780
open mind. But fundamentally, they both have a place in the ecosystem to extreme places,

17:15.780 --> 17:20.980
but nonetheless, legitimate places. And if I were on Twitter, I'd follow them both and just kind of

17:20.980 --> 17:25.540
balance it out because yeah, man, there are crazies everywhere. And it's important to see

17:25.540 --> 17:28.820
all the crazies everywhere, but it's also important to understand that that's not everyone.

17:28.820 --> 17:32.180
That's not even the majority of people. So anyway, this is more of an off the cuff video.

17:32.180 --> 17:35.540
I figured I'd just talk about chuds of TikTok for a while. And that was, you know,

17:35.540 --> 17:39.620
a fun little bit of time. I will see you guys next time. I love you.
