0	10440	Well, that's it. They nicked the new Twitter account, guys. I hadn't even posted on it
10440	15520	yet. I guess I'm on a watchlist now or something. I've come back from the dead too many times.
15520	20600	But you know what? It's Twitter. Accounts are a dime a dozen. I'm sure if I cool off
20600	26320	for a couple months, come back, it'll be okay. And while prepping for this video, I realized
26320	29920	just how annoying it is to surf Twitter or try to get news from Twitter without having
29920	34120	an account. Like here, I'm on Lilith's account, right? We'll just scroll down a bit. Look
34120	40160	what happens. See more tweets from Lilith. Love it. Well, I would love to sign in. But
40160	43700	actually I realized a really interesting thing you can do. I installed uBlock Origin. You
43700	49160	got the element zapper. You zap the box. You zap the clear coat. And then you can scroll
49160	55040	again, no problem. And if you want to interact with anything, then you just zap this layer
55040	59140	that's bugging you and you can click on things. No problem. Again, Twitter becomes normal
59140	63620	and usable. Anyway, we all know about libs at TikTok at this point, right? I've done
63620	67440	a few videos on them. I think you guys know my opinion at this point. They're clearly
67440	71360	a biased source of information, but they are still a source of information. The things
71360	77500	that they show off, like another kids at drag event or a second grade teacher who's explaining
77500	82840	a workaround that they use to discuss gender ideology with students. Sometimes these captions
82840	89040	are a bit hyperbolic, but they are posting real pictures and real videos made by real
89040	94800	people who do seem to be doing some shady stuff. So clearly libs of TikTok has an ideological
94800	99520	bent. It's in the name, but she's still a reasonable source of information. You just
99520	102860	have to go in there with that in mind. She's reporting on things that are really happening,
102860	106440	but she herself is biased. And there's the obvious problem of the spotlight effect where
106440	110660	she is only showing you things that are good for her side. And that's fair enough. I consider
110660	115580	myself to be independently minded enough that I can look at what she's talking about,
115580	119300	notice that it might be a problem, but still not accept it as if this is the prevailing
119300	123340	narrative because it's not, it's only one narrative, but there is a counterpart to libs
123340	129980	of TikTok, someone who is just as partisan, but on the other side, and that is chuds of
129980	136300	TikTok. It's quite the name, you know, considering how often the word chud is memed. I thought
136300	140220	the left would have grown out of using it by now because it's, it's dunked on so much,
140260	144380	but I mean, I saw Adam and Sitch yesterday. I'm recording this on Monday. I saw Adam and
144380	149780	Sitch yesterday and they were doing like a, a teardown of Xander Hall's attack on mauler
149780	153680	and Xander Hall was like, chuds, chuds, chuds, like Jesus Christ, dude, 2015 wants their
153680	157620	terminology back. Fuck. But here we are. This is the inverse from a leftist perspective.
157620	161820	Looking at the right, we've got chuds of TikTok. And in fact, the icon looks kind of similar.
161820	165420	You know, like you look at libs of TikTok, it's got like the gender, the gender nonconformity
165420	169380	symbol. You look at chuds of TikTok, it's got QAnon. It's like, okay, I can appreciate
169380	173620	that. They're going for the same kind of memes. And on chuds of TikTok, you will find
173620	178660	things that are pretty much the inverse of libs of TikTok. The stuff they say is true.
178660	183620	They don't make anything up, but they add their own specifically lefty spin to it. And
183620	188100	they only report on things that suits their narrative. So in my opinion, you take libs
188100	194180	of TikTok, you take chuds of TikTok, you smash them together. You, you absorb real happenings
194180	199300	from both positions and you probably get some semblance of what the truth is. Here's a Q
199300	205300	anon casualty story. A man in Michigan shot and killed his wife and dog injuring his daughter
205300	210580	who's now in the hospital. Also firing at police responders who killed him in the shootout.
210580	215820	He reportedly, according to a Reddit post, had severe QAnon delusions that started after
215820	220580	the 2020 election. Yep, the internet ruined him. Growing up, my parents were extremely
220580	224180	loving happy people. I always had a special bond with both my parents. In 2020 after Trump
224180	228420	lost, my dad started going down the QAnon rabbit hole. He kept reading conspiracy theories
228420	232540	about the election stolen, Trump, vaccines, et cetera. He always said he wanted to keep
232540	236500	us safe and healthy. It kept getting worse and he verbally snapped at us a few times.
236500	240580	Nothing physical though. He never got physical with anyone. Well, at around 4am on September
240580	244380	11th, he had an argument with my mother. He decided to take our guns and shoot her, my
244380	247860	dog and my sister. My mother succumbed to her wounds and my sister is in the hospital
247860	252060	right now. My dad also fired back at the cops and they killed him. I'm shocked. I don't
252060	256100	even know what to say. Fuck you QAnon. I hope the FBI tightens its grip on you and that
256100	261460	your lackeys rot in prison. Jesus, that's wild, man. I know that some of the rightoids
261460	266280	who watch my channel sometimes get a bit triggered by this, but there are some legitimate crazies
266280	271520	on your side, dude. You can't fucking deny. Man compares his struggles as a mega to what
271520	277740	happened to the Jews in the Holocaust. Thursday's speech from Biden. Jesus Christ, two minutes,
277740	282020	37 seconds. I thought that TikTok was known for its brevity. All right, let's see what
282020	290980	is going on here. And this sounds awful familiar for me. Very familiar. If you don't see it,
290980	295340	I don't think you ever will see it. And I posted a video on this before. I did the video,
295340	300800	I did the tubcast with Lilith and I did my own video. People are complaining about that
300800	305140	one. That's fine. It's not that I don't see it, it's that I don't agree with you. And
305140	308020	Lord have mercy on our souls for those that don't see it.
308020	317180	Dad, you're never going to believe it. Hitler just won the election and he's blaming us.
317180	319700	Is he doing anything? Okay, right.
319700	324900	The Jews for all the problems in the country. Oh, don't be silly. Those politicians will
324900	332740	say anything to get elected. Dad, did you see the new Nazi newspaper? It's spreading
332740	339940	lies and some terrible things about it. Jesus Christ, he does this for like 10 years. Okay,
339940	343700	maybe I get the point. They're going to show the escalation. You don't want to watch all
343700	344700	this for this video.
344700	348140	Turn this down here again. Your mother and I are going anywhere.
348140	355780	All right, dude. Do you see the correlation here? Do you see where two and two is going
355780	361140	together? All you got to do is just change one thing to the other. You don't see it?
361540	364260	No, I don't. And here's the reason why I don't see it.
364260	370100	Anyone can be persecuted, but the linchpin is are you being persecuted for a legitimate reason
370100	375060	or not? It probably doesn't need to be said, but the Jews in Germany weren't persecuted for a
375060	380180	legitimate reason. Are mega people being persecuted for a legitimate reason? That's going to depend
380180	383380	on your point of view. If you believe that the election was stolen from you, then no,
383380	387140	you're freedom fighters. However, if you believe that the election wasn't stolen,
387140	391540	now you are illegitimately usurping a democratic process. And that's dangerous. You know,
391540	396420	this is the crux of the whole one man's terrorist, another man's freedom fighter situation. Just
396420	400500	because you are being targeted does not automatically make you a victim in the same
400500	406340	way that criminals are not victims. It's more complicated than that. Moreover, let's see if
406340	410820	what's happening in this video is actually happening to mega people. Hold on. Okay, hold on.
410820	416260	Let's see. Let's see. Dad, did you see the new Nazi newspaper? It's spreading lies and saying
416260	421460	terrible things about us. Okay. It might be the case, assuming that you're correct,
421460	426180	that everything Biden said about you is a lie. Okay. I'll give you that one, even though I don't
426180	432020	agree. We're not allowed to have gatherings anymore and they're passing anti-Jewish laws
432020	439300	in parliament. Okay. So are they cracking down on mega gatherings? You can make a joke about
439300	446660	COVID all you want, but gatherings specifically for the purposes of discussing or spreading the
446660	451700	mega point of view. I just saw a Trump rally yesterday. What are you guys talking about?
452900	457780	I think this analogy kind of falls apart. And frankly, I think Mr. Meth addict here might just
457780	462500	be a bit of a snowflake who really wants to reap some of that victimhood power that the left has
462500	467060	been getting high on for the past decade. So yeah, I would agree with Chet's TikTok here. This is
467060	471620	pretty low worthy. I didn't threaten anybody proceeds to make a vague threat about fighting
471620	475860	the government. Now you're really starting to piss me off because now I'm being contacted by
475860	479860	people that I've never met before telling me that I need to be worried about the things that come
479860	485620	out of my mouth and the content of my videos, not on this platform, but social media platforms.
485620	490820	Well, I got something to say to you. You can suck a whole fucking nest of bird dicks.
490820	496020	You want to know why? Because freedom of speech is freedom of speech. I haven't threatened anybody
496740	502820	come on my fucking land and see what a threat is. But you guys, on the other hand, your presidential
502820	509060	fucking overreaching powers and your bullshit fucking policies that you've enforced, that is
509060	513140	a clear declaration of war on the people of this country and a people across this planet.
513860	519380	So my big question that I have for you is who gets to hold you accountable when all the blood
519380	527140	gets fucking spilt on the ground? Huh? Who holds you accountable? We'll see in the near future.
529060	536020	Okay. We'll see in the near future. That was the moment when it tipped from angry libertarian
536660	542420	into actual threat, at least as the tweet says a vague threat. So it's like, I didn't threaten
542420	547700	anybody by the way, when the feds come to my house, I'm going to have my AR 15 primed and
547700	553140	ready. Jesus Christ. Dudes, you ain't kicking anyone's ass. Is that supposed to be asses?
554420	557940	Okay. Dudes, you ain't kicking anyone's assess anytime soon.
559220	565060	Hey, those photographs are the UN forces in the United States. All I gotta say is,
565060	569780	dudes, our ancestors kicked the British off this country twice.
570500	572260	Jesus. Where are you recording this?
573140	581300	You're here under behalf of sloppy Joe. All I gotta say, I think I'm speaking for all Americans.
582180	588260	Bring it. We'll kick your asses out of here. And you might have a little friend going with you.
590740	597860	United not heads does not scare Americans. Hell, you can't scare people in foreign countries.
598820	606340	You think you can come here and intimidate us. All right. All right. Solid patriotic sentiments
606340	610020	from our drunk uncle over here. I'm not exactly sure what he's talking about. I don't, I didn't,
610020	613780	I didn't recognize whatever he was referencing, but the rest of the message, it wasn't, wasn't
613780	617300	all that objectionable. To be honest, he's just kind of a redneck. It's like, whatever
617300	622020	something tells me they're more upset about race and not the fact that live action Disney
622020	627060	remakes have been awful. Okay. Let's see. This is a quartering video accounts like this.
627060	631860	They always go after the quartering because Jeremy is kind of a big fish on YouTube when
631860	635700	it comes to this, this area of the internet at this point. And if they can shut up an
635700	640020	anti woke advocate with over a million subs, they'll consider it a massive victory. So
640020	644100	the locust backfire in history, Disney demolished over the little mermaid in the recent little
644100	648900	mermaid remake. They made Ariel black because all of the gingers are becoming black people.
648900	652740	That's just how it is in the modern era. And let's see some of these comments that apparently
652820	658340	are about race or a racist replacement isn't inclusion. It's a blatant racism to hate the
658340	662740	people who created something cool, but at the same time, desire to take everything they created as
662740	667380	yours to compensate for your own. I get his point. That's not really a racist comment. I will
667380	672740	disagree with his first sentence though. Inclusion is replacement. If there's a fixed, finite number
672740	678420	of spots, if you have say 10 spots and 10 white people, and then you boot out one of the white
678420	682180	people to put in a black person, well, you've made things more inclusive and more diverse,
682180	686740	but you've also replaced one white person. Now you can argue whether or not that's morally
686740	690260	justified. It might actually be depending what we're talking about, but it's still
690260	693940	replacement. Let's see here. If they race changed Ariel, we should demand that they
693940	698340	change the race of black Panthers. Someone like Ben Affleck in the next movie keeps this equal
698340	702580	all across the board. I mean, yeah, fair enough. Doesn't bother me. My favorite part is when the
702580	706580	race swapped character said it's race swap in time and race swap the entire theater,
706580	710340	truly one of the Disney movies of all time. That's that's just the Morbius meme. Here's
710340	714260	what's going on here that doesn't seem to understand. I can't speak for all commenters.
714260	717380	I certainly can't speak for Jeremy, but I can speak for myself and I can speak for a lot of
717380	722500	people that I know what's going on here is that people don't really care too much about the race
722500	726260	swapped thing. Like, yeah, it's cringe. Like, you know, the little mermaid isn't isn't a black
726260	731060	person. You know, this is specifically a European folk tale and therefore it is proper to put a
731060	735540	European in the role. You wouldn't take an African folk tale and put a white person in that role,
735540	739300	obviously, or maybe you would, maybe it should go both ways. I don't know. But whatever ethic
739300	743380	that we're appealing to, we should be using it across the board. What's actually happening here,
743380	747300	though, the more important conversation, all of this media that's coming out right now,
747300	751460	they're they're trash. That's the whole point of my Lord of the Rings series with with Arch and
751460	755380	Kibbs and Lilith. That's the whole point of like, it's a Gundam and Mauler and guys like that
755380	759620	talking about She-Hulk. All these shows and movies coming out, they're pure garbage. And what they're
759620	765140	doing is they're presenting the fact that they have people of color in lead roles as defense as
765140	768580	to why they're garbage. Like, well, you can't criticize our terrible show now or our terrible
768580	773780	movie because there's a black woman, a strong and proud and beautiful black woman in the lead.
773780	779940	So if you criticize us, you're racist. The true race conversation here is how the Corpos are using
779940	786260	race as a shield for the declining quality of their products and their profit extraction schemes.
786260	791700	And leftoids are running defense for them, even as they claim to be socialist and whatever else.
791700	796500	They will soy the fuck out at this shit. That's what's going on here. But that doesn't really
796500	801060	fit Chud's of TikTok's narrative. So that's going over her head. I'm assuming it's a her just like
801060	805700	just like Liv's a TikTok is. The communists are trying to take over the world and you're on TikTok?
806980	818100	They spent the better part of 70 years setting this shit up. 102 year movement of the Communist
818100	824500	Party. Complete world domination. You guys really think that we're going to win this battle
825060	829780	sitting here on TikTok? You guys really think that? You guys think that we're going to win
829780	835860	this war without a single shot fired? The indoctrination worked on you too.
837060	842820	Glow posting aside, let's let's take her at face value, OK? And this just isn't some fed.
842820	847140	All right. What exactly is Chud's of TikTok complaining about? We hear this rhetoric all
847140	851140	the time from the left. Fascists are everywhere. Fascists are in the government. Everyone's a
851140	855780	fascist. We need to rise up and overthrow the system. We can't rely on democracy anymore.
855780	859940	Electoralism is what destroys our movement. We need direct action. We need to get in the streets.
859940	864500	We need to riot. We need to throw bricks through windows. Libs get the bullet to overthrow this
864500	868420	oppressive capitalist system. You hear this from the left all the time. In fact, I would argue
868420	874740	insofar as the mainstream posting on the Internet, you hear a lot more calls to violence from the
874740	880180	left than the right. I would argue insofar as the right calls to violence. There are revolutionary
880180	883780	rightists out there. There are like neo reactionaries, other crazy people, but they're
883780	887860	kind of relegated to their own very tiny corners of the Internet because our society is very
887860	893700	sensitive to right wing calls to violence, but not so much left wing ones. There's always a new riot.
893700	897780	There's always some new figurehead calling for an overthrow of the capitalist system,
897780	902100	which is why you'll see something like this. If you're an anarchist, anti-fascist, Marxist
902100	907700	organization that does mutual aid, protests, local organizing, helping the unhoused or low income,
907700	911140	please DM me for promoting events and retweet this so I can reach out to groups across the
911140	917460	nation. Okay, so they want to do the mutual aid thing. They are explicitly and openly leftist
917460	923220	revolutionaries against the liberal capitalist state. This is farther to the left than Libs of
923220	927940	TikTok goes in the right. You don't see Libs of TikTok posting. If you're like a revolutionary
927940	932660	Christian nationalist or a fascist or something, DM me and we'll start organizing for our violent
932660	938260	uprising. You don't hear that come out of Libs of TikTok. Now, who knows if the person behind
938260	942500	Libs of TikTok really is that extreme? I'm sure at least some of the people following them are,
942500	949060	but the point is they don't openly say it. And that is, at least by this metric, what makes
949060	953700	Chuds of TikTok a bit more yikes-y, in my opinion. However, as you scroll through Chuds of TikTok,
953700	960340	you begin to see very similar types of content. You'll see videos and clips from YouTubers and
960340	965940	from TV. You'll see articles. You'll see TikTok videos from right-leaning TikTok accounts.
965940	970500	It's all the same kind of thing that Libs of TikTok does. It really is the mirror inverse.
970500	974260	And as I scroll through, I'm realizing like, yeah, there are some crazy fucking people
974900	981300	on TikTok, you know? Joe Biden said that we need F-15s in order to defeat this government.
981300	987780	Well, I got some news for you. Those F-15s belong to us. We'll just go and fucking take them.
988260	994100	Tread lightly, Joe. Tread fucking lightly. Like, Jesus Christ, dude, that's a bit ridiculous,
994100	998020	isn't it? You really think that you're going to be able to walk onto a military base and not get
998020	1003780	blown the fuck up? Go ahead and try. Fuck. Like, there are some dumb people on TikTok,
1003780	1008100	but that just seems to be TikTok's thing. Everyone just seems to be a retard. You got left-leaning
1008100	1012820	retards. You got right-leaning retards. It's just a whole platform full of retards. And frankly,
1013780	1020420	I'm happy for chuds of TikTok's existence. They are just as disgustingly partisan as Libs of
1020420	1026420	TikTok. But you know what? They both serve their purpose. They both present real people and they
1026420	1031220	both refuse to present anything that might refute their position. So you got to go into it with an
1031220	1035780	open mind. But fundamentally, they both have a place in the ecosystem to extreme places,
1035780	1040980	but nonetheless, legitimate places. And if I were on Twitter, I'd follow them both and just kind of
1040980	1045540	balance it out because yeah, man, there are crazies everywhere. And it's important to see
1045540	1048820	all the crazies everywhere, but it's also important to understand that that's not everyone.
1048820	1052180	That's not even the majority of people. So anyway, this is more of an off the cuff video.
1052180	1055540	I figured I'd just talk about chuds of TikTok for a while. And that was, you know,
1055540	1059620	a fun little bit of time. I will see you guys next time. I love you.
