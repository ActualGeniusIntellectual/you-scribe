1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
I've been too busy with E3 the past couple of days to notice that the hashtag I stand

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,080
with Scott has been trending on Twitter, and I'll just say, boy is it nice being off

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,080
Twitter.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,280
Every time I step away from that place I realize exactly just how much of a shithole it is.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,560
Maybe one day I'll make my departure permanent.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,680
But this trending hashtag refers to indie game developer Scott Cawthon.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,760
Cawthon has a long history of making games that nobody ever played or knows about, before

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,000
finally coming to prominence in 2014 for creating the cult hit Five Nights at Freddy's.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,840
For those of you who don't know what Five Nights at Freddy's is, maybe you're a boomer

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,500
or you don't play video games or something, it's a horror game where you play as a night

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,220
shift security guard at a Chuck E. Cheese style pizzeria with playgrounds, party rooms

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,400
and animatronics used to entertain the kids.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,000
But between midnight and 6am the animatronics come alive and slowly begin to make their

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,660
way towards the security booth.

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,760
You can't leave the office but you do have access to a tablet that displays various security

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,120
camera feeds, and you also have control of the lighting and locking mechanisms of the

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,060
office's two doors.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,280
Using any of these tools, the camera, the lights, or keeping the door locked, will drain

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
your power.

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,200
And if you run out you're as good as dead, so you have to use the camera to see when

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,680
the animatronics are approaching.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,480
Use the lights if you can't find one on the cameras and you think it might be down one

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,040
of the two visible hallways, and then lock the doors if they're close.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,640
Once you strip away the horror and meme aspects of the game, it's ultimately a quasi-tower

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,520
defense resource manager, where you're unable to leave one location and only have a limited

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,260
amount of juice to fend off attacks, meaning the point of the game is learning how the

27
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,760
animatronics attack you and how to efficiently defend yourself.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,340
Watching the clips I've included in the video, it's not hard to see how this game

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,080
garnered a cult following and basically made Cawthon's career, right?

30
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,360
The characters are simultaneously a little bit cute and extremely unnerving.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,200
The premise is unique, or at least it was in 2014.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,400
The horror is well done, and the amount of deep lore and hidden easter eggs buried in

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,800
the game helped spur interest long after the game's release.

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,120
And on the technical side of things, because the majority of the game's files are still

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,000
images, the game is tiny, cheap, and easy to run on even old computers.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,560
It's no surprise that a full franchise came out of it, as fans fell in love with the game

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,600
and streamers and YouTubers made careers out of autistically dissecting everything Cawthon

38
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
released.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,360
So, what's Scott Cawthon getting cancelled for?

40
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,320
Oh yeah, I didn't even mention this as a cancelling event.

41
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,520
Yeah, it's a cancelling event.

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,280
That's what the hashtag is all about.

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,740
His supporters are using it and the progs are trying to co-opt it.

44
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,140
But here, here it is.

45
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,100
Here is the gravest sin of Scott Cawthon.

46
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,580
He is a Republican.

47
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,020
Dun dun dun.

48
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,100
More specifically, he voted for Trump and donated to various other Republican politicians,

49
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,500
as well as Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom the left consider to be anti-LGBTQ.

50
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,680
I don't know why this information is coming out right now, because political donations

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
are a public record.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,740
Maybe it's just that nobody'd thought to look up his name before?

53
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,900
In any case, the tweet is trending and people are outraged.

54
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,740
Including the usual bread tube suspects.

55
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,500
Listen guys, don't go feeding people that bullshit line that wokeness isn't leftism,

56
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
it's actually radical liberalism.

57
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,980
Here you are and you're not libs, you're a big reason why leftism is fucking cancer

58
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,980
right now.

59
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,980
And of course, there are a ton of brain dead twitter takes from people with rose emojis

60
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,540
or hammer and sickles in their bio that we could go over, but we're not doing that

61
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,540
this time.

62
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,900
I'm sure you can just imagine them in your head at this point and you'd probably be

63
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
largely accurate.

64
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,300
You know what these NPCs are saying before we even look at the hashtags, let's not even

65
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,300
bother.

66
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,140
This time, I'm going to take a slightly different approach.

67
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,340
Instead of looking at twitter cancer, let's look at tiktok cancer.

68
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,980
Please do not buy the BTS meal if you don't stand them, you're preventing actual BTS

69
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,820
fans who have waited for months for having the BTS meal experience.

70
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,220
Eating the sauces without understanding their significance is literally cultural appropriation

71
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,540
and it's not okay.

72
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:42,420
If you don't know what the fuck she's talking about, BTS or Bangtan Sun Young Den or Bangtan

73
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,780
Boys is a Korean boy band and McDonald's is currently having a promotion related to

74
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,780
their band.

75
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,340
I find the Korean boy band thing to be pure cancer.

76
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,660
But the important point here is that she called the consumption of the promotional material

77
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,660
cultural appropriation and by the widest definition of the Prague's own rules, she's technically

78
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,660
not wrong.

79
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,420
BTS stands are a subculture and if cultural appropriation is consuming a part of a culture

80
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,340
without fully understanding it, then eating the meal without liking BTS is definitely

81
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,600
cultural appropriation.

82
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,500
This is an idea I covered more fully in my consumption as identity video where the main

83
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,060
thesis was that there's been a subtle shift in how people approach collective identity.

84
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,700
Before if you identified as having an immutable characteristic, like if you were publicly

85
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,060
gay or something, the immutable characteristic was something that you could be discriminated

86
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,200
against for and shouldn't be because, well, it's an immutable characteristic.

87
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,180
It's not your fault you were born this way.

88
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,500
But nowadays, if you identify as having an immutable characteristic, it's the identification

89
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,340
not the immutable characteristic that is considered the linchpin for discrimination.

90
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,940
Eventually this became a demand for any identity at all, whether or not it had an associated

91
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,620
immutable characteristic, to become a protected class as long as that class contained a collective

92
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,020
of people with the proper political opinions.

93
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,780
Which is how you get ridiculous hypersensitive individuals demanding that you play choice

94
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,460
based video games according to their specific headcanon or only ship specific characters

95
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,700
in a fandom or else it's bigotry.

96
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,300
And of course, by this standard, eating the BTS McDonald's meal without being a fan

97
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,980
of BTS is oppression.

98
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,080
I'm bringing this up in the context of a video about Scott Cawthon to make a specific

99
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
point.

100
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,920
There are a handful of other games that are kind of like Five Nights at Freddy's, not

101
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,360
in that they're horror games but animatronics, but rather because they're all games that

102
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,200
heavily resonated with gamers, inspiring works of art or remixes of music, creating entire

103
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,100
communities generally centered around Twitter or Tumblr, and launching the careers of streamers

104
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,300
and YouTubers who obsessively play the game.

105
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,440
The other games with fandoms like this include, most recently, Among Us, but also Minecraft,

106
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,600
Undertale, Doki Doki Literature Club, and to a lesser extent, Hollow Knight and Stardew Valley.

107
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,640
These are all indie titles that didn't have the backing of any major publisher but ultimately

108
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,580
massively blew up, raking in millions of dollars, launching careers, and influencing the whole

109
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,620
of gaming.

110
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,780
These are all also games that have generated a specific type of toxic fandom, filled with

111
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,780
extremely left-leaning people who near universally support a wide range of both progressive and

112
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,820
socialist ideas, who are simultaneously also extremely sensitive, irritable, and entirely

113
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,660
insufferable to be around.

114
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,140
And these fandoms are filled with these types of people, specifically for the reason that

115
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,980
I described in that consumption as identity video.

116
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,020
They accept intersectionality wholesale, and they've brought it to its logical end.

117
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,660
They've fractionated all of the intersecting identities down to the most minute possible

118
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,440
things, including stuff like, if you make Alphys kill herself in Undertale, you're homophobic

119
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:32,060
and ableist, and considering that to be on par with, like, lynching black people or something.

120
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,360
I've even seen this attitude creep into more mainstream games, with idiot journos saying

121
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,760
that you're a bigot if you don't play as femshep, and allow Garrus and Tally to romance

122
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,740
each other by staying away from both of them.

123
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,160
This is obviously a fucking stupid position to hold.

124
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,740
What do you think happens if you take one of these games, with these toxic fanbases

125
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,120
full of wokescolds, who have decided that their love of the game should be a protected

126
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,640
political class, and then reveal to them that the game's creator is a Republican?

127
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,240
Well, you get the meltdown that we're seeing right now.

128
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,520
Some people are even calling for Markiplier to be considered the true creator of Five

129
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,040
Nights at Freddy's, since he streamed it back in the day and helped it blow up, and

130
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,080
he's still stuck in that progressive stage that you should have grown out of by your

131
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
mid-twenties.

132
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,800
It's one thing to actively hate gay people.

133
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,920
Seek them out, and harm them in some way.

134
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,000
It is another thing entirely to be a Christian and disagree with gay people acting on their

135
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,440
sexuality, but still be kind to the gay individuals that you happen to meet.

136
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,080
From all accounts of Cawthon's conduct, from fans who have met him to statements he's

137
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,280
made, he's the latter, not the former.

138
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:34,200
He seems to accept LGBT people, but not what a Christian would call the LGBT lifestyle,

139
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,560
which is exactly what Christ calls him to do, with the whole hate the sinner not the

140
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
sin thing.

141
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,440
There is a huge gap between this guy and the Westboro Baptist Church, but I would not expect

142
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,920
a Prague to understand that.

143
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,200
There is a lesson here, a lesson that the screeching Five Nights at Freddy's fans will

144
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,480
probably never learn, but I will present it here anyway.

145
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,420
Not everything about you needs to be accepted by every person you come across.

146
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,080
If you're gay and you meet a Christian, and that Christian doesn't violate your rights

147
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,520
in any way at all, he doesn't mistreat you or act rudely, he simply thinks you shouldn't

148
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,000
fuck other men, and he will tell you that opinion straightforwardly if you happen to

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,320
ask him for it, then you have zero reason to complain.

150
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,660
He's not doing anything to you, but he's also under no obligation to accept all of you,

151
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,940
and neither is anybody else.

152
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,080
This is even more true with trans people.

153
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,360
A lot of the most radical rhetoric regarding trans activism right now revolves around requiring

154
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,020
everybody, every single human being, to accept all trans people as they want to be accepted.

155
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,020
Or else you're literally killing them.

156
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,360
It's a ridiculous notion.

157
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,100
And even though I would do it, I still ultimately retain the right not to, and you can think

158
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,640
whatever you want of me regarding that, but you won't force me to say something, no matter

159
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,740
what it is, period.

160
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,020
Most telling of all, if your transness is truly about your identification, it's truly

161
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,840
about how you feel and not anything else, then you don't need anybody else's acceptance,

162
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
right?

163
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,760
I have met a lot of people in my time who haven't accepted one aspect of me, whether

164
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,720
that's a part of my personality, or my history, or my profession, or my tone of voice, or

165
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,280
my political beliefs, or my race, or gender, or sex, or sexuality, or whatever else.

166
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,600
We all have some quality that somebody else is not going to accept about us, and that's

167
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,600
okay.

168
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,600
It's not a violation of your rights if somebody doesn't accept you for who you are, and does

169
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,860
nothing else to you.

170
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,280
And of course, you are also under no obligation to continue to talk to somebody who doesn't

171
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
accept you too.

172
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,860
But that's the whole point of voluntary association, isn't it?

173
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,180
Cawthon made a post on Reddit about the controversy.

174
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,420
He did not issue any kind of apology in this post, which made everyone even angrier.

175
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,500
He also said he didn't care if he was cancelled, as he makes games for the love of the craft,

176
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
not for money.

177
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,100
He said that he supported Trump because he believed Trump would be the best for America's

178
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,820
economy and confronting her overseas enemies.

179
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,120
And he also believes that candidates with strong LGBT rhetoric, but who were weak on

180
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,980
the economy and on defense, would ultimately cause more harm to LGBT people, and straight

181
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,260
people as well, through the mismanagement of those other issues.

182
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,580
In the end, this is a lot like Notch, the creator of Minecraft.

183
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,460
From all outward appearances, Notch is not a progressive, he's a liberal.

184
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,260
Due to his sale of Minecraft to Microsoft, he has what is known as fuck you money, meaning

185
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,260
that he doesn't have to worry about being cancelled because they can't do anything to

186
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
him.

187
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,260
What are they going to do, fire him?

188
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,780
He's sitting on a giant stack of like a hundred million dollars, it doesn't matter anymore.

189
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,080
And so, when it comes to his interactions online, he says what he likes.

190
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,700
Back in 2019, when Minecraft was hitting its 10 year anniversary, Microsoft removed all

191
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,140
mentions of Notch from the game, and then said that he would not be a part of the 10th

192
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,140
anniversary.

193
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,060
At the time, progressives branded this as Microsoft rescuing Minecraft from Notch, in

194
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,340
much the same way that people want Markiplier to rescue Fiance at Freddy's from Scott

195
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,340
Cawthon.

196
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,600
These are large, important properties to the subculture of gaming.

197
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,900
They are absolutely surrounded by, used extensively by, and loved by progressives.

198
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,900
These progressives expel people who are ideologically impure all the time.

199
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:57,180
And if it turns out that the creator is ideologically impure, well, he needs to be memory-holed.

200
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,540
Even if it's by a corpo, in the name of that all-encompassing ever-March leftward.

201
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,140
And this is absolutely something people are really tired about.

202
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,360
I think that's why this tweet of mine went viral, where I posted Dr. Manhattan evaporating

203
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,500
the guy that says, as a content creator with a large audience, you have responsibility

204
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,540
to use your platform.

205
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,540
No.

206
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,200
People loved this, because frankly, everybody's tired of it.

207
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,440
Just because you made Minecraft, just because you made Fiance at Freddy's, just because

208
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,180
you have some big YouTube channel, some big Twitch channel, whatever, none of that means

209
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,120
that you have to push progressive politics.

210
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,000
I've even been given that, and my channel is, I mean, it's not nothing anymore, but

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,880
it's small compared to these guys.

212
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,160
I've been told at least a few times now by local progressives that, don't I have a responsibility

213
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,280
to act in a certain way and talk about certain topics and push certain causes?

214
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,040
Because my channel has, at the time, 90,000 subs?

215
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
No.

216
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,360
I do what I want.

217
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,240
If you have politics, if you have ideas you want to push, push them on your own platforms.

218
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
And you know what?

219
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,280
I did actually get replies from some progressives, and they basically restated the content of

220
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,280
the image.

221
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,080
But like, don't you really have a responsibility to do that?

222
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
No.

223
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
No.

224
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,980
Cawthon ends his reply post, which again, wasn't an apology, by saying, if people

225
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,800
think I'm doing more harm than good now, then maybe it's better that I get canceled

226
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
and retire.

227
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
I would accept that.

228
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,920
I've had a fulfilling career.

229
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,500
Besides, most things that people can take from you are things that never had much value

230
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
to begin with.

231
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,740
I have always loved, and will continue to love, this community and this fanbase, even

232
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,000
if someday it doesn't include me anymore.

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,680
And to be honest, this is the best possible way that one should handle a canceling attempt.

234
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,480
In fact, it's what I described as the best possible way in my Encyclopedia Problematica

235
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
video.

236
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Maybe Scott Cawthon watches my channel.

237
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
Hey Scott, if you're here, leave a comment.

238
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,800
Also, Five Nights at Freddy's kinda got bland after the second one, eh?

239
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,580
But the point is, here's what you should do.

240
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,760
You plant yourself firmly beside what you believe.

241
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,460
You refuse to budge, and you flip the bird to everybody who wants your blood.

242
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,940
They can only take from you if you let them.

243
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,940
So don't.

244
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,680
I like each of my videos to have a thesis beyond the initial event that gets the ball

245
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
rolling.

246
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,820
So that it's not just about the current news cycle, but something that you can watch

247
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,000
a year later and still pull something out of it.

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,240
And this time, here is that thesis.

249
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,920
There's this drive nowadays for the ultimate tolerance and acceptance and inclusivity.

250
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,440
Everybody must be made to feel like they're part of the collective at all times, or else

251
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,840
it's oppressive, it's othering.

252
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,560
But the truth is, you can't make everybody like you.

253
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,960
And sometimes there's even value to being the outsider.

254
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,280
But no matter what, there will always be people who don't like you for some reason or another.

255
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,680
That's not necessarily an excuse to piss people off for no reason, although trolling

256
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,340
can be pretty fun sometimes.

257
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,620
But most of the time, there's always going to be some quality about yourself that somebody

258
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,180
else will not accept you for, whether it's fair for them to do so or not.

259
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,700
You can't change that.

260
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,660
So the best thing you can do is stand by what you believe.

261
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,740
If you have to be hated by somebody for something, then be hated for what you truly are.

262
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,540
And to be honest, as long as the people are just hating you from a distance and staying

263
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,340
out of your life, who cares?

264
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,840
Alright guys, that's it for me for today.

265
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,020
Rather than posting E3 stream announcement videos every day and not actually give people

266
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,000
who watch SFO but don't care about Game Boomers nothing, I wanted to do an actual video today.

267
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
So here it is, I know it's small but I hope you enjoyed.

268
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,460
And if you do care about E3 or you do care about Game Boomers, you'll be seeing my next

269
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,100
E3 stream today at 1pm EST.

270
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:21,420
We're watching the Xbox and Bethesda E3 conference over at twitch.tv slash Game Boomers.

271
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,160
Make sure you join me, it'll be a lot of fun.

272
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,980
At least if you're watching this video on release.

273
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,420
Otherwise, if you're watching it in the future sometime, well drop by anyway, I'll probably

274
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,420
be streaming something else.

275
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,100
Alright guys, I'll see you there.

276
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Thanks for watching.

277
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,600
I love you.
