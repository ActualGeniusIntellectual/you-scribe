0	9800	I've been too busy with E3 the past couple of days to notice that the hashtag I stand
9800	14080	with Scott has been trending on Twitter, and I'll just say, boy is it nice being off
14080	15080	Twitter.
15080	18280	Every time I step away from that place I realize exactly just how much of a shithole it is.
18280	20560	Maybe one day I'll make my departure permanent.
20560	24680	But this trending hashtag refers to indie game developer Scott Cawthon.
24680	28760	Cawthon has a long history of making games that nobody ever played or knows about, before
28760	33000	finally coming to prominence in 2014 for creating the cult hit Five Nights at Freddy's.
33000	36840	For those of you who don't know what Five Nights at Freddy's is, maybe you're a boomer
36840	40500	or you don't play video games or something, it's a horror game where you play as a night
40500	45220	shift security guard at a Chuck E. Cheese style pizzeria with playgrounds, party rooms
45220	47400	and animatronics used to entertain the kids.
47400	52000	But between midnight and 6am the animatronics come alive and slowly begin to make their
52000	53660	way towards the security booth.
53660	57760	You can't leave the office but you do have access to a tablet that displays various security
57760	62120	camera feeds, and you also have control of the lighting and locking mechanisms of the
62120	64060	office's two doors.
64060	68280	Using any of these tools, the camera, the lights, or keeping the door locked, will drain
68280	69280	your power.
69280	72200	And if you run out you're as good as dead, so you have to use the camera to see when
72200	73680	the animatronics are approaching.
73680	76480	Use the lights if you can't find one on the cameras and you think it might be down one
76480	80040	of the two visible hallways, and then lock the doors if they're close.
80040	84640	Once you strip away the horror and meme aspects of the game, it's ultimately a quasi-tower
84640	88520	defense resource manager, where you're unable to leave one location and only have a limited
88520	92260	amount of juice to fend off attacks, meaning the point of the game is learning how the
92260	95760	animatronics attack you and how to efficiently defend yourself.
95760	98340	Watching the clips I've included in the video, it's not hard to see how this game
98340	102080	garnered a cult following and basically made Cawthon's career, right?
102080	105360	The characters are simultaneously a little bit cute and extremely unnerving.
105360	108200	The premise is unique, or at least it was in 2014.
108200	112400	The horror is well done, and the amount of deep lore and hidden easter eggs buried in
112400	115800	the game helped spur interest long after the game's release.
115800	119120	And on the technical side of things, because the majority of the game's files are still
119120	124000	images, the game is tiny, cheap, and easy to run on even old computers.
124000	127560	It's no surprise that a full franchise came out of it, as fans fell in love with the game
127560	131600	and streamers and YouTubers made careers out of autistically dissecting everything Cawthon
131600	132600	released.
132600	134360	So, what's Scott Cawthon getting cancelled for?
134360	136320	Oh yeah, I didn't even mention this as a cancelling event.
136320	137520	Yeah, it's a cancelling event.
137520	139280	That's what the hashtag is all about.
139280	141740	His supporters are using it and the progs are trying to co-opt it.
141740	143140	But here, here it is.
143140	146100	Here is the gravest sin of Scott Cawthon.
146100	147580	He is a Republican.
147580	149020	Dun dun dun.
149020	153100	More specifically, he voted for Trump and donated to various other Republican politicians,
153100	156500	as well as Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom the left consider to be anti-LGBTQ.
156500	160680	I don't know why this information is coming out right now, because political donations
160680	161680	are a public record.
161680	163740	Maybe it's just that nobody'd thought to look up his name before?
163740	166900	In any case, the tweet is trending and people are outraged.
166900	168740	Including the usual bread tube suspects.
168740	173500	Listen guys, don't go feeding people that bullshit line that wokeness isn't leftism,
173500	175500	it's actually radical liberalism.
175500	178980	Here you are and you're not libs, you're a big reason why leftism is fucking cancer
178980	179980	right now.
179980	183980	And of course, there are a ton of brain dead twitter takes from people with rose emojis
183980	187540	or hammer and sickles in their bio that we could go over, but we're not doing that
187540	188540	this time.
188540	190900	I'm sure you can just imagine them in your head at this point and you'd probably be
190900	191900	largely accurate.
191900	195300	You know what these NPCs are saying before we even look at the hashtags, let's not even
195300	196300	bother.
196300	198140	This time, I'm going to take a slightly different approach.
198540	202340	Instead of looking at twitter cancer, let's look at tiktok cancer.
202340	207980	Please do not buy the BTS meal if you don't stand them, you're preventing actual BTS
207980	211820	fans who have waited for months for having the BTS meal experience.
211820	216220	Eating the sauces without understanding their significance is literally cultural appropriation
216220	217540	and it's not okay.
217540	222420	If you don't know what the fuck she's talking about, BTS or Bangtan Sun Young Den or Bangtan
222420	226780	Boys is a Korean boy band and McDonald's is currently having a promotion related to
226780	227780	their band.
228420	231340	I find the Korean boy band thing to be pure cancer.
231340	235660	But the important point here is that she called the consumption of the promotional material
235660	240660	cultural appropriation and by the widest definition of the Prague's own rules, she's technically
240660	241660	not wrong.
241660	246420	BTS stands are a subculture and if cultural appropriation is consuming a part of a culture
246420	250340	without fully understanding it, then eating the meal without liking BTS is definitely
250340	251600	cultural appropriation.
251600	255500	This is an idea I covered more fully in my consumption as identity video where the main
255500	259060	thesis was that there's been a subtle shift in how people approach collective identity.
259060	262700	Before if you identified as having an immutable characteristic, like if you were publicly
262700	267060	gay or something, the immutable characteristic was something that you could be discriminated
267060	271200	against for and shouldn't be because, well, it's an immutable characteristic.
271200	273180	It's not your fault you were born this way.
273180	277500	But nowadays, if you identify as having an immutable characteristic, it's the identification
277500	281340	not the immutable characteristic that is considered the linchpin for discrimination.
281340	284940	Eventually this became a demand for any identity at all, whether or not it had an associated
284940	289620	immutable characteristic, to become a protected class as long as that class contained a collective
289620	292020	of people with the proper political opinions.
292020	295780	Which is how you get ridiculous hypersensitive individuals demanding that you play choice
295780	300460	based video games according to their specific headcanon or only ship specific characters
300460	302700	in a fandom or else it's bigotry.
302700	306300	And of course, by this standard, eating the BTS McDonald's meal without being a fan
306300	307980	of BTS is oppression.
307980	312080	I'm bringing this up in the context of a video about Scott Cawthon to make a specific
312080	313080	point.
313080	315920	There are a handful of other games that are kind of like Five Nights at Freddy's, not
315920	319360	in that they're horror games but animatronics, but rather because they're all games that
319360	324200	heavily resonated with gamers, inspiring works of art or remixes of music, creating entire
324200	328100	communities generally centered around Twitter or Tumblr, and launching the careers of streamers
328100	330300	and YouTubers who obsessively play the game.
330300	335440	The other games with fandoms like this include, most recently, Among Us, but also Minecraft,
335440	340600	Undertale, Doki Doki Literature Club, and to a lesser extent, Hollow Knight and Stardew Valley.
340640	344640	These are all indie titles that didn't have the backing of any major publisher but ultimately
344640	349580	massively blew up, raking in millions of dollars, launching careers, and influencing the whole
349580	350620	of gaming.
350620	354780	These are all also games that have generated a specific type of toxic fandom, filled with
354780	359780	extremely left-leaning people who near universally support a wide range of both progressive and
359780	365820	socialist ideas, who are simultaneously also extremely sensitive, irritable, and entirely
365820	367660	insufferable to be around.
367780	371140	And these fandoms are filled with these types of people, specifically for the reason that
371140	373980	I described in that consumption as identity video.
373980	378020	They accept intersectionality wholesale, and they've brought it to its logical end.
378020	381660	They've fractionated all of the intersecting identities down to the most minute possible
381660	386440	things, including stuff like, if you make Alphys kill herself in Undertale, you're homophobic
386440	392060	and ableist, and considering that to be on par with, like, lynching black people or something.
392060	396360	I've even seen this attitude creep into more mainstream games, with idiot journos saying
396360	400760	that you're a bigot if you don't play as femshep, and allow Garrus and Tally to romance
400760	402740	each other by staying away from both of them.
402740	405160	This is obviously a fucking stupid position to hold.
405160	408740	What do you think happens if you take one of these games, with these toxic fanbases
408740	412120	full of wokescolds, who have decided that their love of the game should be a protected
412120	416640	political class, and then reveal to them that the game's creator is a Republican?
416640	419240	Well, you get the meltdown that we're seeing right now.
419240	422520	Some people are even calling for Markiplier to be considered the true creator of Five
422520	426040	Nights at Freddy's, since he streamed it back in the day and helped it blow up, and
426040	429080	he's still stuck in that progressive stage that you should have grown out of by your
429080	430080	mid-twenties.
430080	432800	It's one thing to actively hate gay people.
432800	434920	Seek them out, and harm them in some way.
434920	439000	It is another thing entirely to be a Christian and disagree with gay people acting on their
439000	442440	sexuality, but still be kind to the gay individuals that you happen to meet.
442440	446080	From all accounts of Cawthon's conduct, from fans who have met him to statements he's
446080	448280	made, he's the latter, not the former.
448280	454200	He seems to accept LGBT people, but not what a Christian would call the LGBT lifestyle,
454200	457560	which is exactly what Christ calls him to do, with the whole hate the sinner not the
457560	458560	sin thing.
458560	463440	There is a huge gap between this guy and the Westboro Baptist Church, but I would not expect
463440	464920	a Prague to understand that.
464920	468200	There is a lesson here, a lesson that the screeching Five Nights at Freddy's fans will
468200	471480	probably never learn, but I will present it here anyway.
471480	475420	Not everything about you needs to be accepted by every person you come across.
475420	479080	If you're gay and you meet a Christian, and that Christian doesn't violate your rights
479080	483520	in any way at all, he doesn't mistreat you or act rudely, he simply thinks you shouldn't
483520	487000	fuck other men, and he will tell you that opinion straightforwardly if you happen to
487000	490320	ask him for it, then you have zero reason to complain.
490320	494660	He's not doing anything to you, but he's also under no obligation to accept all of you,
494660	495940	and neither is anybody else.
495940	498080	This is even more true with trans people.
498080	503360	A lot of the most radical rhetoric regarding trans activism right now revolves around requiring
503360	509020	everybody, every single human being, to accept all trans people as they want to be accepted.
509020	511020	Or else you're literally killing them.
511020	512360	It's a ridiculous notion.
512360	517100	And even though I would do it, I still ultimately retain the right not to, and you can think
517100	521640	whatever you want of me regarding that, but you won't force me to say something, no matter
521640	523740	what it is, period.
523740	529020	Most telling of all, if your transness is truly about your identification, it's truly
529020	533840	about how you feel and not anything else, then you don't need anybody else's acceptance,
533840	534840	right?
534840	538760	I have met a lot of people in my time who haven't accepted one aspect of me, whether
538760	543720	that's a part of my personality, or my history, or my profession, or my tone of voice, or
543720	549280	my political beliefs, or my race, or gender, or sex, or sexuality, or whatever else.
549280	553600	We all have some quality that somebody else is not going to accept about us, and that's
553600	554600	okay.
554600	557600	It's not a violation of your rights if somebody doesn't accept you for who you are, and does
557600	558860	nothing else to you.
558860	562280	And of course, you are also under no obligation to continue to talk to somebody who doesn't
562280	563280	accept you too.
563280	565860	But that's the whole point of voluntary association, isn't it?
565860	568180	Cawthon made a post on Reddit about the controversy.
568180	572420	He did not issue any kind of apology in this post, which made everyone even angrier.
572420	576500	He also said he didn't care if he was cancelled, as he makes games for the love of the craft,
576500	577500	not for money.
577500	580100	He said that he supported Trump because he believed Trump would be the best for America's
580100	582820	economy and confronting her overseas enemies.
582820	587120	And he also believes that candidates with strong LGBT rhetoric, but who were weak on
587120	591980	the economy and on defense, would ultimately cause more harm to LGBT people, and straight
591980	595260	people as well, through the mismanagement of those other issues.
595260	598580	In the end, this is a lot like Notch, the creator of Minecraft.
598580	602460	From all outward appearances, Notch is not a progressive, he's a liberal.
602460	607260	Due to his sale of Minecraft to Microsoft, he has what is known as fuck you money, meaning
607260	610260	that he doesn't have to worry about being cancelled because they can't do anything to
610260	611260	him.
611260	612260	What are they going to do, fire him?
612260	615780	He's sitting on a giant stack of like a hundred million dollars, it doesn't matter anymore.
615780	619080	And so, when it comes to his interactions online, he says what he likes.
619080	623700	Back in 2019, when Minecraft was hitting its 10 year anniversary, Microsoft removed all
623700	628140	mentions of Notch from the game, and then said that he would not be a part of the 10th
628140	629140	anniversary.
629140	634060	At the time, progressives branded this as Microsoft rescuing Minecraft from Notch, in
634060	638340	much the same way that people want Markiplier to rescue Fiance at Freddy's from Scott
638340	639340	Cawthon.
639340	642600	These are large, important properties to the subculture of gaming.
642600	647900	They are absolutely surrounded by, used extensively by, and loved by progressives.
647900	651900	These progressives expel people who are ideologically impure all the time.
651900	657180	And if it turns out that the creator is ideologically impure, well, he needs to be memory-holed.
657180	661540	Even if it's by a corpo, in the name of that all-encompassing ever-March leftward.
661540	664140	And this is absolutely something people are really tired about.
664140	668360	I think that's why this tweet of mine went viral, where I posted Dr. Manhattan evaporating
668360	673500	the guy that says, as a content creator with a large audience, you have responsibility
673500	675540	to use your platform.
675540	676540	No.
676540	680200	People loved this, because frankly, everybody's tired of it.
680200	683440	Just because you made Minecraft, just because you made Fiance at Freddy's, just because
683440	687180	you have some big YouTube channel, some big Twitch channel, whatever, none of that means
687180	689120	that you have to push progressive politics.
689120	693000	I've even been given that, and my channel is, I mean, it's not nothing anymore, but
693000	694880	it's small compared to these guys.
694880	699160	I've been told at least a few times now by local progressives that, don't I have a responsibility
699160	703280	to act in a certain way and talk about certain topics and push certain causes?
703280	706040	Because my channel has, at the time, 90,000 subs?
706040	707040	No.
707040	708360	I do what I want.
708360	712240	If you have politics, if you have ideas you want to push, push them on your own platforms.
712240	713240	And you know what?
713240	718280	I did actually get replies from some progressives, and they basically restated the content of
718280	719280	the image.
719280	722080	But like, don't you really have a responsibility to do that?
722080	723080	No.
723080	724080	No.
724080	727980	Cawthon ends his reply post, which again, wasn't an apology, by saying, if people
727980	731800	think I'm doing more harm than good now, then maybe it's better that I get canceled
731800	732800	and retire.
732800	733800	I would accept that.
733800	734920	I've had a fulfilling career.
734920	738500	Besides, most things that people can take from you are things that never had much value
738500	739500	to begin with.
739500	743740	I have always loved, and will continue to love, this community and this fanbase, even
743740	746000	if someday it doesn't include me anymore.
746000	749680	And to be honest, this is the best possible way that one should handle a canceling attempt.
749680	753480	In fact, it's what I described as the best possible way in my Encyclopedia Problematica
753480	754480	video.
754480	755480	Maybe Scott Cawthon watches my channel.
755480	757480	Hey Scott, if you're here, leave a comment.
757480	760800	Also, Five Nights at Freddy's kinda got bland after the second one, eh?
760800	762580	But the point is, here's what you should do.
762580	764760	You plant yourself firmly beside what you believe.
764760	768460	You refuse to budge, and you flip the bird to everybody who wants your blood.
768460	770940	They can only take from you if you let them.
770940	771940	So don't.
771940	775680	I like each of my videos to have a thesis beyond the initial event that gets the ball
775680	776680	rolling.
776680	778820	So that it's not just about the current news cycle, but something that you can watch
778820	781000	a year later and still pull something out of it.
781000	783240	And this time, here is that thesis.
783240	787920	There's this drive nowadays for the ultimate tolerance and acceptance and inclusivity.
787920	791440	Everybody must be made to feel like they're part of the collective at all times, or else
791440	792840	it's oppressive, it's othering.
792840	796560	But the truth is, you can't make everybody like you.
796560	798960	And sometimes there's even value to being the outsider.
798960	803280	But no matter what, there will always be people who don't like you for some reason or another.
803280	806680	That's not necessarily an excuse to piss people off for no reason, although trolling
806680	808340	can be pretty fun sometimes.
808340	812620	But most of the time, there's always going to be some quality about yourself that somebody
812620	817180	else will not accept you for, whether it's fair for them to do so or not.
817180	818700	You can't change that.
818700	821660	So the best thing you can do is stand by what you believe.
821660	826740	If you have to be hated by somebody for something, then be hated for what you truly are.
826740	830540	And to be honest, as long as the people are just hating you from a distance and staying
830540	832340	out of your life, who cares?
832340	834840	Alright guys, that's it for me for today.
834840	839020	Rather than posting E3 stream announcement videos every day and not actually give people
839020	844000	who watch SFO but don't care about Game Boomers nothing, I wanted to do an actual video today.
844000	846560	So here it is, I know it's small but I hope you enjoyed.
846560	851460	And if you do care about E3 or you do care about Game Boomers, you'll be seeing my next
851460	855100	E3 stream today at 1pm EST.
855100	861420	We're watching the Xbox and Bethesda E3 conference over at twitch.tv slash Game Boomers.
861420	863160	Make sure you join me, it'll be a lot of fun.
863160	864980	At least if you're watching this video on release.
864980	868420	Otherwise, if you're watching it in the future sometime, well drop by anyway, I'll probably
868420	869420	be streaming something else.
869420	871100	Alright guys, I'll see you there.
871100	872100	Thanks for watching.
872100	872600	I love you.
