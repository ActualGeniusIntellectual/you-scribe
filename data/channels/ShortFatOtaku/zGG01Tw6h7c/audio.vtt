00:00.000 --> 00:09.800
I've been too busy with E3 the past couple of days to notice that the hashtag I stand

00:09.800 --> 00:14.080
with Scott has been trending on Twitter, and I'll just say, boy is it nice being off

00:14.080 --> 00:15.080
Twitter.

00:15.080 --> 00:18.280
Every time I step away from that place I realize exactly just how much of a shithole it is.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.560
Maybe one day I'll make my departure permanent.

00:20.560 --> 00:24.680
But this trending hashtag refers to indie game developer Scott Cawthon.

00:24.680 --> 00:28.760
Cawthon has a long history of making games that nobody ever played or knows about, before

00:28.760 --> 00:33.000
finally coming to prominence in 2014 for creating the cult hit Five Nights at Freddy's.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.840
For those of you who don't know what Five Nights at Freddy's is, maybe you're a boomer

00:36.840 --> 00:40.500
or you don't play video games or something, it's a horror game where you play as a night

00:40.500 --> 00:45.220
shift security guard at a Chuck E. Cheese style pizzeria with playgrounds, party rooms

00:45.220 --> 00:47.400
and animatronics used to entertain the kids.

00:47.400 --> 00:52.000
But between midnight and 6am the animatronics come alive and slowly begin to make their

00:52.000 --> 00:53.660
way towards the security booth.

00:53.660 --> 00:57.760
You can't leave the office but you do have access to a tablet that displays various security

00:57.760 --> 01:02.120
camera feeds, and you also have control of the lighting and locking mechanisms of the

01:02.120 --> 01:04.060
office's two doors.

01:04.060 --> 01:08.280
Using any of these tools, the camera, the lights, or keeping the door locked, will drain

01:08.280 --> 01:09.280
your power.

01:09.280 --> 01:12.200
And if you run out you're as good as dead, so you have to use the camera to see when

01:12.200 --> 01:13.680
the animatronics are approaching.

01:13.680 --> 01:16.480
Use the lights if you can't find one on the cameras and you think it might be down one

01:16.480 --> 01:20.040
of the two visible hallways, and then lock the doors if they're close.

01:20.040 --> 01:24.640
Once you strip away the horror and meme aspects of the game, it's ultimately a quasi-tower

01:24.640 --> 01:28.520
defense resource manager, where you're unable to leave one location and only have a limited

01:28.520 --> 01:32.260
amount of juice to fend off attacks, meaning the point of the game is learning how the

01:32.260 --> 01:35.760
animatronics attack you and how to efficiently defend yourself.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.340
Watching the clips I've included in the video, it's not hard to see how this game

01:38.340 --> 01:42.080
garnered a cult following and basically made Cawthon's career, right?

01:42.080 --> 01:45.360
The characters are simultaneously a little bit cute and extremely unnerving.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.200
The premise is unique, or at least it was in 2014.

01:48.200 --> 01:52.400
The horror is well done, and the amount of deep lore and hidden easter eggs buried in

01:52.400 --> 01:55.800
the game helped spur interest long after the game's release.

01:55.800 --> 01:59.120
And on the technical side of things, because the majority of the game's files are still

01:59.120 --> 02:04.000
images, the game is tiny, cheap, and easy to run on even old computers.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.560
It's no surprise that a full franchise came out of it, as fans fell in love with the game

02:07.560 --> 02:11.600
and streamers and YouTubers made careers out of autistically dissecting everything Cawthon

02:11.600 --> 02:12.600
released.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.360
So, what's Scott Cawthon getting cancelled for?

02:14.360 --> 02:16.320
Oh yeah, I didn't even mention this as a cancelling event.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.520
Yeah, it's a cancelling event.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.280
That's what the hashtag is all about.

02:19.280 --> 02:21.740
His supporters are using it and the progs are trying to co-opt it.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.140
But here, here it is.

02:23.140 --> 02:26.100
Here is the gravest sin of Scott Cawthon.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.580
He is a Republican.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.020
Dun dun dun.

02:29.020 --> 02:33.100
More specifically, he voted for Trump and donated to various other Republican politicians,

02:33.100 --> 02:36.500
as well as Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, all of whom the left consider to be anti-LGBTQ.

02:36.500 --> 02:40.680
I don't know why this information is coming out right now, because political donations

02:40.680 --> 02:41.680
are a public record.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.740
Maybe it's just that nobody'd thought to look up his name before?

02:43.740 --> 02:46.900
In any case, the tweet is trending and people are outraged.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.740
Including the usual bread tube suspects.

02:48.740 --> 02:53.500
Listen guys, don't go feeding people that bullshit line that wokeness isn't leftism,

02:53.500 --> 02:55.500
it's actually radical liberalism.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.980
Here you are and you're not libs, you're a big reason why leftism is fucking cancer

02:58.980 --> 02:59.980
right now.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.980
And of course, there are a ton of brain dead twitter takes from people with rose emojis

03:03.980 --> 03:07.540
or hammer and sickles in their bio that we could go over, but we're not doing that

03:07.540 --> 03:08.540
this time.

03:08.540 --> 03:10.900
I'm sure you can just imagine them in your head at this point and you'd probably be

03:10.900 --> 03:11.900
largely accurate.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.300
You know what these NPCs are saying before we even look at the hashtags, let's not even

03:15.300 --> 03:16.300
bother.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.140
This time, I'm going to take a slightly different approach.

03:18.540 --> 03:22.340
Instead of looking at twitter cancer, let's look at tiktok cancer.

03:22.340 --> 03:27.980
Please do not buy the BTS meal if you don't stand them, you're preventing actual BTS

03:27.980 --> 03:31.820
fans who have waited for months for having the BTS meal experience.

03:31.820 --> 03:36.220
Eating the sauces without understanding their significance is literally cultural appropriation

03:36.220 --> 03:37.540
and it's not okay.

03:37.540 --> 03:42.420
If you don't know what the fuck she's talking about, BTS or Bangtan Sun Young Den or Bangtan

03:42.420 --> 03:46.780
Boys is a Korean boy band and McDonald's is currently having a promotion related to

03:46.780 --> 03:47.780
their band.

03:48.420 --> 03:51.340
I find the Korean boy band thing to be pure cancer.

03:51.340 --> 03:55.660
But the important point here is that she called the consumption of the promotional material

03:55.660 --> 04:00.660
cultural appropriation and by the widest definition of the Prague's own rules, she's technically

04:00.660 --> 04:01.660
not wrong.

04:01.660 --> 04:06.420
BTS stands are a subculture and if cultural appropriation is consuming a part of a culture

04:06.420 --> 04:10.340
without fully understanding it, then eating the meal without liking BTS is definitely

04:10.340 --> 04:11.600
cultural appropriation.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.500
This is an idea I covered more fully in my consumption as identity video where the main

04:15.500 --> 04:19.060
thesis was that there's been a subtle shift in how people approach collective identity.

04:19.060 --> 04:22.700
Before if you identified as having an immutable characteristic, like if you were publicly

04:22.700 --> 04:27.060
gay or something, the immutable characteristic was something that you could be discriminated

04:27.060 --> 04:31.200
against for and shouldn't be because, well, it's an immutable characteristic.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.180
It's not your fault you were born this way.

04:33.180 --> 04:37.500
But nowadays, if you identify as having an immutable characteristic, it's the identification

04:37.500 --> 04:41.340
not the immutable characteristic that is considered the linchpin for discrimination.

04:41.340 --> 04:44.940
Eventually this became a demand for any identity at all, whether or not it had an associated

04:44.940 --> 04:49.620
immutable characteristic, to become a protected class as long as that class contained a collective

04:49.620 --> 04:52.020
of people with the proper political opinions.

04:52.020 --> 04:55.780
Which is how you get ridiculous hypersensitive individuals demanding that you play choice

04:55.780 --> 05:00.460
based video games according to their specific headcanon or only ship specific characters

05:00.460 --> 05:02.700
in a fandom or else it's bigotry.

05:02.700 --> 05:06.300
And of course, by this standard, eating the BTS McDonald's meal without being a fan

05:06.300 --> 05:07.980
of BTS is oppression.

05:07.980 --> 05:12.080
I'm bringing this up in the context of a video about Scott Cawthon to make a specific

05:12.080 --> 05:13.080
point.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.920
There are a handful of other games that are kind of like Five Nights at Freddy's, not

05:15.920 --> 05:19.360
in that they're horror games but animatronics, but rather because they're all games that

05:19.360 --> 05:24.200
heavily resonated with gamers, inspiring works of art or remixes of music, creating entire

05:24.200 --> 05:28.100
communities generally centered around Twitter or Tumblr, and launching the careers of streamers

05:28.100 --> 05:30.300
and YouTubers who obsessively play the game.

05:30.300 --> 05:35.440
The other games with fandoms like this include, most recently, Among Us, but also Minecraft,

05:35.440 --> 05:40.600
Undertale, Doki Doki Literature Club, and to a lesser extent, Hollow Knight and Stardew Valley.

05:40.640 --> 05:44.640
These are all indie titles that didn't have the backing of any major publisher but ultimately

05:44.640 --> 05:49.580
massively blew up, raking in millions of dollars, launching careers, and influencing the whole

05:49.580 --> 05:50.620
of gaming.

05:50.620 --> 05:54.780
These are all also games that have generated a specific type of toxic fandom, filled with

05:54.780 --> 05:59.780
extremely left-leaning people who near universally support a wide range of both progressive and

05:59.780 --> 06:05.820
socialist ideas, who are simultaneously also extremely sensitive, irritable, and entirely

06:05.820 --> 06:07.660
insufferable to be around.

06:07.780 --> 06:11.140
And these fandoms are filled with these types of people, specifically for the reason that

06:11.140 --> 06:13.980
I described in that consumption as identity video.

06:13.980 --> 06:18.020
They accept intersectionality wholesale, and they've brought it to its logical end.

06:18.020 --> 06:21.660
They've fractionated all of the intersecting identities down to the most minute possible

06:21.660 --> 06:26.440
things, including stuff like, if you make Alphys kill herself in Undertale, you're homophobic

06:26.440 --> 06:32.060
and ableist, and considering that to be on par with, like, lynching black people or something.

06:32.060 --> 06:36.360
I've even seen this attitude creep into more mainstream games, with idiot journos saying

06:36.360 --> 06:40.760
that you're a bigot if you don't play as femshep, and allow Garrus and Tally to romance

06:40.760 --> 06:42.740
each other by staying away from both of them.

06:42.740 --> 06:45.160
This is obviously a fucking stupid position to hold.

06:45.160 --> 06:48.740
What do you think happens if you take one of these games, with these toxic fanbases

06:48.740 --> 06:52.120
full of wokescolds, who have decided that their love of the game should be a protected

06:52.120 --> 06:56.640
political class, and then reveal to them that the game's creator is a Republican?

06:56.640 --> 06:59.240
Well, you get the meltdown that we're seeing right now.

06:59.240 --> 07:02.520
Some people are even calling for Markiplier to be considered the true creator of Five

07:02.520 --> 07:06.040
Nights at Freddy's, since he streamed it back in the day and helped it blow up, and

07:06.040 --> 07:09.080
he's still stuck in that progressive stage that you should have grown out of by your

07:09.080 --> 07:10.080
mid-twenties.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.800
It's one thing to actively hate gay people.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.920
Seek them out, and harm them in some way.

07:14.920 --> 07:19.000
It is another thing entirely to be a Christian and disagree with gay people acting on their

07:19.000 --> 07:22.440
sexuality, but still be kind to the gay individuals that you happen to meet.

07:22.440 --> 07:26.080
From all accounts of Cawthon's conduct, from fans who have met him to statements he's

07:26.080 --> 07:28.280
made, he's the latter, not the former.

07:28.280 --> 07:34.200
He seems to accept LGBT people, but not what a Christian would call the LGBT lifestyle,

07:34.200 --> 07:37.560
which is exactly what Christ calls him to do, with the whole hate the sinner not the

07:37.560 --> 07:38.560
sin thing.

07:38.560 --> 07:43.440
There is a huge gap between this guy and the Westboro Baptist Church, but I would not expect

07:43.440 --> 07:44.920
a Prague to understand that.

07:44.920 --> 07:48.200
There is a lesson here, a lesson that the screeching Five Nights at Freddy's fans will

07:48.200 --> 07:51.480
probably never learn, but I will present it here anyway.

07:51.480 --> 07:55.420
Not everything about you needs to be accepted by every person you come across.

07:55.420 --> 07:59.080
If you're gay and you meet a Christian, and that Christian doesn't violate your rights

07:59.080 --> 08:03.520
in any way at all, he doesn't mistreat you or act rudely, he simply thinks you shouldn't

08:03.520 --> 08:07.000
fuck other men, and he will tell you that opinion straightforwardly if you happen to

08:07.000 --> 08:10.320
ask him for it, then you have zero reason to complain.

08:10.320 --> 08:14.660
He's not doing anything to you, but he's also under no obligation to accept all of you,

08:14.660 --> 08:15.940
and neither is anybody else.

08:15.940 --> 08:18.080
This is even more true with trans people.

08:18.080 --> 08:23.360
A lot of the most radical rhetoric regarding trans activism right now revolves around requiring

08:23.360 --> 08:29.020
everybody, every single human being, to accept all trans people as they want to be accepted.

08:29.020 --> 08:31.020
Or else you're literally killing them.

08:31.020 --> 08:32.360
It's a ridiculous notion.

08:32.360 --> 08:37.100
And even though I would do it, I still ultimately retain the right not to, and you can think

08:37.100 --> 08:41.640
whatever you want of me regarding that, but you won't force me to say something, no matter

08:41.640 --> 08:43.740
what it is, period.

08:43.740 --> 08:49.020
Most telling of all, if your transness is truly about your identification, it's truly

08:49.020 --> 08:53.840
about how you feel and not anything else, then you don't need anybody else's acceptance,

08:53.840 --> 08:54.840
right?

08:54.840 --> 08:58.760
I have met a lot of people in my time who haven't accepted one aspect of me, whether

08:58.760 --> 09:03.720
that's a part of my personality, or my history, or my profession, or my tone of voice, or

09:03.720 --> 09:09.280
my political beliefs, or my race, or gender, or sex, or sexuality, or whatever else.

09:09.280 --> 09:13.600
We all have some quality that somebody else is not going to accept about us, and that's

09:13.600 --> 09:14.600
okay.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.600
It's not a violation of your rights if somebody doesn't accept you for who you are, and does

09:17.600 --> 09:18.860
nothing else to you.

09:18.860 --> 09:22.280
And of course, you are also under no obligation to continue to talk to somebody who doesn't

09:22.280 --> 09:23.280
accept you too.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.860
But that's the whole point of voluntary association, isn't it?

09:25.860 --> 09:28.180
Cawthon made a post on Reddit about the controversy.

09:28.180 --> 09:32.420
He did not issue any kind of apology in this post, which made everyone even angrier.

09:32.420 --> 09:36.500
He also said he didn't care if he was cancelled, as he makes games for the love of the craft,

09:36.500 --> 09:37.500
not for money.

09:37.500 --> 09:40.100
He said that he supported Trump because he believed Trump would be the best for America's

09:40.100 --> 09:42.820
economy and confronting her overseas enemies.

09:42.820 --> 09:47.120
And he also believes that candidates with strong LGBT rhetoric, but who were weak on

09:47.120 --> 09:51.980
the economy and on defense, would ultimately cause more harm to LGBT people, and straight

09:51.980 --> 09:55.260
people as well, through the mismanagement of those other issues.

09:55.260 --> 09:58.580
In the end, this is a lot like Notch, the creator of Minecraft.

09:58.580 --> 10:02.460
From all outward appearances, Notch is not a progressive, he's a liberal.

10:02.460 --> 10:07.260
Due to his sale of Minecraft to Microsoft, he has what is known as fuck you money, meaning

10:07.260 --> 10:10.260
that he doesn't have to worry about being cancelled because they can't do anything to

10:10.260 --> 10:11.260
him.

10:11.260 --> 10:12.260
What are they going to do, fire him?

10:12.260 --> 10:15.780
He's sitting on a giant stack of like a hundred million dollars, it doesn't matter anymore.

10:15.780 --> 10:19.080
And so, when it comes to his interactions online, he says what he likes.

10:19.080 --> 10:23.700
Back in 2019, when Minecraft was hitting its 10 year anniversary, Microsoft removed all

10:23.700 --> 10:28.140
mentions of Notch from the game, and then said that he would not be a part of the 10th

10:28.140 --> 10:29.140
anniversary.

10:29.140 --> 10:34.060
At the time, progressives branded this as Microsoft rescuing Minecraft from Notch, in

10:34.060 --> 10:38.340
much the same way that people want Markiplier to rescue Fiance at Freddy's from Scott

10:38.340 --> 10:39.340
Cawthon.

10:39.340 --> 10:42.600
These are large, important properties to the subculture of gaming.

10:42.600 --> 10:47.900
They are absolutely surrounded by, used extensively by, and loved by progressives.

10:47.900 --> 10:51.900
These progressives expel people who are ideologically impure all the time.

10:51.900 --> 10:57.180
And if it turns out that the creator is ideologically impure, well, he needs to be memory-holed.

10:57.180 --> 11:01.540
Even if it's by a corpo, in the name of that all-encompassing ever-March leftward.

11:01.540 --> 11:04.140
And this is absolutely something people are really tired about.

11:04.140 --> 11:08.360
I think that's why this tweet of mine went viral, where I posted Dr. Manhattan evaporating

11:08.360 --> 11:13.500
the guy that says, as a content creator with a large audience, you have responsibility

11:13.500 --> 11:15.540
to use your platform.

11:15.540 --> 11:16.540
No.

11:16.540 --> 11:20.200
People loved this, because frankly, everybody's tired of it.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.440
Just because you made Minecraft, just because you made Fiance at Freddy's, just because

11:23.440 --> 11:27.180
you have some big YouTube channel, some big Twitch channel, whatever, none of that means

11:27.180 --> 11:29.120
that you have to push progressive politics.

11:29.120 --> 11:33.000
I've even been given that, and my channel is, I mean, it's not nothing anymore, but

11:33.000 --> 11:34.880
it's small compared to these guys.

11:34.880 --> 11:39.160
I've been told at least a few times now by local progressives that, don't I have a responsibility

11:39.160 --> 11:43.280
to act in a certain way and talk about certain topics and push certain causes?

11:43.280 --> 11:46.040
Because my channel has, at the time, 90,000 subs?

11:46.040 --> 11:47.040
No.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.360
I do what I want.

11:48.360 --> 11:52.240
If you have politics, if you have ideas you want to push, push them on your own platforms.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.240
And you know what?

11:53.240 --> 11:58.280
I did actually get replies from some progressives, and they basically restated the content of

11:58.280 --> 11:59.280
the image.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.080
But like, don't you really have a responsibility to do that?

12:02.080 --> 12:03.080
No.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.080
No.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.980
Cawthon ends his reply post, which again, wasn't an apology, by saying, if people

12:07.980 --> 12:11.800
think I'm doing more harm than good now, then maybe it's better that I get canceled

12:11.800 --> 12:12.800
and retire.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.800
I would accept that.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.920
I've had a fulfilling career.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.500
Besides, most things that people can take from you are things that never had much value

12:18.500 --> 12:19.500
to begin with.

12:19.500 --> 12:23.740
I have always loved, and will continue to love, this community and this fanbase, even

12:23.740 --> 12:26.000
if someday it doesn't include me anymore.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.680
And to be honest, this is the best possible way that one should handle a canceling attempt.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.480
In fact, it's what I described as the best possible way in my Encyclopedia Problematica

12:33.480 --> 12:34.480
video.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.480
Maybe Scott Cawthon watches my channel.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.480
Hey Scott, if you're here, leave a comment.

12:37.480 --> 12:40.800
Also, Five Nights at Freddy's kinda got bland after the second one, eh?

12:40.800 --> 12:42.580
But the point is, here's what you should do.

12:42.580 --> 12:44.760
You plant yourself firmly beside what you believe.

12:44.760 --> 12:48.460
You refuse to budge, and you flip the bird to everybody who wants your blood.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.940
They can only take from you if you let them.

12:50.940 --> 12:51.940
So don't.

12:51.940 --> 12:55.680
I like each of my videos to have a thesis beyond the initial event that gets the ball

12:55.680 --> 12:56.680
rolling.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.820
So that it's not just about the current news cycle, but something that you can watch

12:58.820 --> 13:01.000
a year later and still pull something out of it.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.240
And this time, here is that thesis.

13:03.240 --> 13:07.920
There's this drive nowadays for the ultimate tolerance and acceptance and inclusivity.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.440
Everybody must be made to feel like they're part of the collective at all times, or else

13:11.440 --> 13:12.840
it's oppressive, it's othering.

13:12.840 --> 13:16.560
But the truth is, you can't make everybody like you.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.960
And sometimes there's even value to being the outsider.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.280
But no matter what, there will always be people who don't like you for some reason or another.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.680
That's not necessarily an excuse to piss people off for no reason, although trolling

13:26.680 --> 13:28.340
can be pretty fun sometimes.

13:28.340 --> 13:32.620
But most of the time, there's always going to be some quality about yourself that somebody

13:32.620 --> 13:37.180
else will not accept you for, whether it's fair for them to do so or not.

13:37.180 --> 13:38.700
You can't change that.

13:38.700 --> 13:41.660
So the best thing you can do is stand by what you believe.

13:41.660 --> 13:46.740
If you have to be hated by somebody for something, then be hated for what you truly are.

13:46.740 --> 13:50.540
And to be honest, as long as the people are just hating you from a distance and staying

13:50.540 --> 13:52.340
out of your life, who cares?

13:52.340 --> 13:54.840
Alright guys, that's it for me for today.

13:54.840 --> 13:59.020
Rather than posting E3 stream announcement videos every day and not actually give people

13:59.020 --> 14:04.000
who watch SFO but don't care about Game Boomers nothing, I wanted to do an actual video today.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.560
So here it is, I know it's small but I hope you enjoyed.

14:06.560 --> 14:11.460
And if you do care about E3 or you do care about Game Boomers, you'll be seeing my next

14:11.460 --> 14:15.100
E3 stream today at 1pm EST.

14:15.100 --> 14:21.420
We're watching the Xbox and Bethesda E3 conference over at twitch.tv slash Game Boomers.

14:21.420 --> 14:23.160
Make sure you join me, it'll be a lot of fun.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.980
At least if you're watching this video on release.

14:24.980 --> 14:28.420
Otherwise, if you're watching it in the future sometime, well drop by anyway, I'll probably

14:28.420 --> 14:29.420
be streaming something else.

14:29.420 --> 14:31.100
Alright guys, I'll see you there.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.100
Thanks for watching.

14:32.100 --> 14:32.600
I love you.
