WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.000
Welcome back, everyone. We're doing another, um, another doubleheader tonight because real life seems to get in the way of everything all the time. All of our jobs and all of our, all of our commitments and all of Kib's streams. We just, we just can't seem to get it together, but we're here.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Wow, he name dropped me.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Well, he's singling me out.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
All of us, Kibs!

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
All of us, all of us, but you more than the rest.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
You deserve it. You can always move your streams. Your streams are flexible. I can now move my shit.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
That's right.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
This is your fault.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Arch and Lilith, you both work outside of the house.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Yep.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
Unlike a lot of people, I have a job.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Yeah, my job is streaming.

00:49.000 --> 00:59.000
So we are here watching The Last of Us episodes seven, which was last week's episodes that we missed and eight, which is today's episode. So at least something's going to be new.

00:59.000 --> 01:13.000
Real quick before we start, since it's been two weeks, the last episode that we watched was the point where the show seemed to start to go downhill for me quite a bit because they ruined that very important Ellie Joel scene by undercutting all of its emotional impact.

01:13.000 --> 01:20.000
By having that Joel Tommy scene in the workshop where Joel talks about having panic attacks, which was not in the game that was added.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
You all might not be too surprised with this, but the Internet doesn't agree with me. The Internet loved that episode.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
In fact, there's a bunch of articles floating around like this one on, let's say, more progressive leaning media sites.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
This one is titled The Last of Us.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
Joel exemplifies the strength of non-toxic masculinity.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Now, this is a long, boring article, as a lot of these articles tend to be.

01:46.000 --> 01:57.000
The point basically is, is that because Joel had that moment of weakness where he talks honestly about his inability to care for Ellie and how how he's weak and it bothers him.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
He is an example of non-toxic masculinity.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
So can any of you point out the issue with with this line of logic?

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Well, it's simple. Masculinity is being strong and capable.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
Non-toxic masculinity is being weak and having fucking heart attacks because...

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
That's part of the problem.

02:16.000 --> 02:25.000
If you look at, let's say, characters that are traditionally masculine, that progressives would call toxic masculine, like toxically masculine, they have toxic masculinity.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
We can even stay within the realm of pop culture.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
You can look at Superman, you can look at, let's say, Jean-Luc Picard, you can look at Han Solo, let's say.

02:33.000 --> 02:41.000
These are all toxically masculine characters because they're too strong, they're too sure of themselves, forge the path forward and they disregard others' opinions sometimes.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
Han Solo especially is a womanizer.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
So there you go, they're objectifying women and they're not, they're toxically masculine.

02:48.000 --> 02:59.000
OK, the issue ultimately is that Joel admits in the show to being a murderer and not just, you know, you kill someone in self-defense because you had to or you're facing off against an evil enemy.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
No, he admits in the show, he jumped innocent people to take their stuff to survive.

03:05.000 --> 03:14.000
Now, as far as I understand, the heroes of old, of the previous generation that exemplify toxic masculinity, they didn't do that.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
Like, Han Solo was the thief with the heart of gold, right?

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
Like, he didn't just kill people for no reason or for like very self-serving reasons.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Joel did.

03:25.000 --> 03:37.000
It's very strange because these people, they're putting forward this narrative that you can actually be the worst type of person, but as long as you cry about it later, then you're not toxic.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yep.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
It's the whole like, oh, I feel bad.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
You know, I maybe was a murdering psychopath, but I felt bad about it.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
So I'm, you know, a good guy now.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
It's, oh, fuck.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
As the old saying goes, it's a feeling that counts, okay?

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
Is that the old saying?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
So that's what happened in the last episode.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
This is how the internet took it.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Apparently leftoids loved that episode.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I thought it was absolute dog shit.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
But it's time for us to watch the next one.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
I just switch over here again, if you don't mind.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
I do mind actually.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Oh, sorry.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Why did you even ask?

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
This is just a normal American suburb right now.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Even the house.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Leave.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Leave.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Shut up, Joel.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Take the gun.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Joel, shut the fuck up!

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
The Mandalorian started up, right?

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Yep.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I guess Pedro Pascal just likes taking care of orphans now.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
That's what he does.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
I don't remember the last part of The Last of Us that well.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
So did she actually just leave them in the game?

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
No, in the game, they just stayed there for like three months and healed them up.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
And she just scavenged to get them alive.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
So she might not necessarily have just outright left, just started leaving.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
I wasn't the fastest. I wasn't the smartest.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Fight about it?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Don't fight.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
She's not here anymore.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Is she?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
The hipster effect.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I'm sure her shitty pace will pick up by standing there for a few minutes.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Oh, are they doing the DLC in this episode?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Yep, I think so.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
My name's Kwon.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Oh my god, it reminds me of the Halo TV show.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Stop, Kwon.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
I care because no matter what anyone out there says or thinks,

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
we're the only thing holding this all together.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
If we go down, the people in this zone will starve or murder each other that much I know.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Considering what we've seen, that seems to be the truth.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
He's right.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
For all the evil that Fedra is.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
I too believe the fascist oppressor is our best hope.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
That's what they're implying.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Which way, Western woman-girl-thing child?

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
Don't do it, Ellie. Don't give in to the fascism.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
She did.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
She's a freak.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Captain Wong is being so nice.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
Is that it?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
That's it.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Sam Ting Wong?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Can I have my Walkman back?

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
You know, I should be offended by that, but I'm not. It was funny.

06:40.000 --> 06:51.000
Now, this is fiction right here, because I've been told repeatedly there were no black comic characters ever.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Ha ha ha ha!

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Uh oh.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Boogaloo.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Boogaloo boogaloo.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
It's a flashback. It's her girlfriend.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Whoa.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Yes, she was black.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
And you said ooga booga when she was coming in through the fucking window.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Damn.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
You racist.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Oh my goodness.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I can't believe you did that.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Nope, that's staying.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Could you add in some jungle drums as well?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Keep it quiet, Harry.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Remember now.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
This better be good.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
And there they are. There's the guards.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Oh yeah, immediately perfectly correct.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Arch, how did you know that this was a lesbian romance situation?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Because you told me about it before.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
Yeah, you told him, literally.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Oh shit, did I spoil this? Did I spoil the DLC?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
You did.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Oh fuck.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
Like, this has been common knowledge for a while now.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
You spoil the entire story to him.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh shit, sorry Arch.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Wait, Canadians are always sorry. That's the point.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Sorry doesn't mean anything to a Canadian.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
It's basically like, go fuck yourself.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.000
Personally, I'm quite fond of lesbians, but I prefer if they were hot and adults.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
And not fucking children. I was going to say not fucking children.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
This is weird in the game, too.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Yeah, they're ages in the game where I think 14 and 17.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
This is just my racism speaking here, but I fucking hate dreads.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Like, they just look bad. I don't like them.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
I object.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
You object to dreads?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
How many floors?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I do.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
You know what?

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
I think they can be done right.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Lots of people do them in a good way.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
I've never banged a girl with dreads before.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Oh, yeah.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Oh, thanks, Steph. Thanks for letting her bitch.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Hold on, hold on.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I've never banged a girl with dreads before, and I want to at least once.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Before I completely rule it out.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
There's probably not as much black people in Canada, though.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
No, there's not. No.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
It's a Bombay.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
But that kind of dreads, where you have like a dread ponytail?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
I just expect there to be something living inside of it.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
You can keep dreads clean, like, and most people do.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
They're not doing that in the post-apocalypse, though.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Oh, no!

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
I don't think floors break that way.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
No.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
They don't.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
That would have to be cut and set up like that.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Dead guy fell on the ground.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Are we endearing?

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
I guess we're going to drink his old, gross booze.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Lauren's urine.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Depends.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
And not even wonder what the fuck it is.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Yeah, like, Jesus.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
You know, despite all of our tripping.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
What if he had cordyceps and...

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Oh.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
He had cordyceps and now they're infected from drinking.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I know. I mean, I know.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Oh, no.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
No, it's fine.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I'm not sure that's how transmission works.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
No.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
I don't need to understand science.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
This show clearly doesn't.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Can I hold your gun?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
That's true.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
Like, that is literally a point I can't even fight you on.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
You know, despite all of our tripping.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
There have been, like, a few cute moments of, like, you know,

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
they're kids and they're growing up and life sucks.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
I mean, this has been cringe, but still, like, okay so far.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Yeah.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
This is pretty wholesome.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
Also, I think I'm just less offended by teenage lesbians than art

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
because I've watched a shit ton of anime.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
And they're always teenage lesbians in that.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Kibs.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Of age in Canada is 16.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Yeah, okay.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I mean, if that's the legal age, then you're fine.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
That's how it is.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
She's trying to make sure there's no lawbreakers here, okay?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Not Losh.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Welcome to Canada.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.000
How does this chick know what a fascist dickbag is?

12:16.000 --> 12:19.000
She's been living in Fedra for most of her life.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
They're not going to educate you on that.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Especially if they actually are them.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
I mean, they probably have, like, dictionaries

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
and they probably do teach to some degree.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
History, maybe?

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
I don't imagine Fedra's education would be too different

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
than American education.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
Like, maybe it's more extreme and more patriotic

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
and more authoritarian.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
But, like, I think they would still teach basic concepts.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
Maybe.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
I would imagine it is because fascist in this world

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
means exactly the same as it means in this world of ours.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Asshole.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
Asshole.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
That's what I have a mild disagreement with.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
You like, you know, cheese on your sandwich?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Well, it's not provable.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Fascist.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Fascist.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Ugh, fuck.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Let me put it like this.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
If you ask dread girls, define fascism,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
I doubt you'd get an answer.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
She'd be like,

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
people that tell me what to do, fascist?

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
So it's the Twitter version of fascism, then?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
Probably.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Most writers don't do research.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Sadly, in the modern era.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Fascist dickbags!

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
She only has one line.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
I like how they're both fighting the shittiness

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
of the other's ideology, even though they both suck.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
Well, they're both screwed.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
It's like, oh, they're starving their population.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
You mean rationing?

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
Does it look like it's easy to get food in the universe?

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
That's a dumb question the seal could have broken.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
And that's not...

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
That is a hole in the roof.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Like, that is very clearly not a standard entrance.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Like, if they had known about it, maybe they had sealed it off.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
I discovered a secret entrance, so it's not sealed.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Ha ha! Fascist.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Clearly the Fedra people were, you know,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
just keeping it to themselves,

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
because they would waste all this precious space.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
So, it turns out when Fedra connected that block up to the grid,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
this place got connected, too.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
Not that they know.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Oh, yeah. I mean, the entire mall

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
can almost control that much energy.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
Pay attention.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
We're gonna go through there, then turn right.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
I'm sure there are dozens of kilowatts.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
We don't know where we're going.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
Fucking turn right, open the door,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
tell me when you're there.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
So, this area is pretty much exactly how it was in the game.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
When they broke into the mall,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
it was the same hole in the ceiling in the same corner with the same stuff.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Like, they remade the set.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
I will say that this show has been consistently good in doing that.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Like, remaking locations exactly.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
That is nice.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
If you're a soulless console peasant and you play this game, poor that is.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Go play the PC version, Arch.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah, you seem to be fine with that, you console scrub.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Arch plays console games, by the way.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Oh.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.000
Ah, yes, that's not gonna alert anybody when the fucking mall lights up.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Yeah, the fucking windows.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
This will definitely be difficult to see from the outside.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
Yeah, I don't think these people know how malls work.

15:54.000 --> 15:59.000
The guy at the federal power plant just sees the power usage spike.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
He's like, what the fuck?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
What the fuck?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
No way.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Playing copyrighted music.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
I love this song.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Of course you do. It's made by Norwegian.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
When I was, like, very, very young, this was on the radio regularly,

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
and now I'm like, oh my god, I'm so old.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
You know...

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Yeah, trust me, you do not want to end up like that Chinese guy that got stuck in the escalator.

16:36.000 --> 16:41.000
Yeah, like, escalators are very dangerous, and this is the one that has been used in 20 years.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Yep. One of them gets caught, sucked in.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000
It's fine, Ellie is doing the thing that her face is getting blended up.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
It's like, fuck, fuck.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
If you guys remember the video.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
What video was that?

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
Oh, it was just, like, a woman, like, after exiting an escalator, that metal plate gives out,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
and she basically got blended.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Oh, fuck, yeah.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
And there was a kid that happened to have a kid, too.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Yeah.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Oh my god.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Is this the Edmonton Mall?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I know they shot this in Canada.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
No, no, they got an abandoned mall instead.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
No, the Edmonton Mall is, um, the biggest mall in Canada.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
It's fucking huge.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
And it's a pretty well-known Canadian spot.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
I swear to god, show.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
If you show me Elliot Page in underwear in this fucking episode, I am going to scream.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
You're, like, three connections removed from Elliot Page right now, Arch.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
I just noticed.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Her eyebrows all fucked up.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
That's annoying me.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
It's been like that the entire show?

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Yeah, but I've just noticed, and I really don't like it now.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
But that's literally Elliot's design.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
They even pointed it out twice?

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
Yeah, she mentioned that there was some kind of fight at a 7-Eleven.

18:11.000 --> 18:17.000
I mean, I wonder what the guy in that generator room, like, at the federal power plant's like, what the fuck?

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
You know this place is, like, eating up so much power.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Yeah, like, all the stores are turned on and shit.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
This is a pretty cheap ride.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
The horses don't even go up and down.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
You know what's funny about this?

18:29.000 --> 18:33.000
This is another procrastinating episode where we don't get to see any cool stuff happen.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
It's been 26 minutes and absolutely nothing of relevance or interest has happened.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm kind of bored.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
I think this is going to be another, um, another episode.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
You lost to some clickers getting their heads smashed.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Yeah, I want to see, like, Zambies and stuff.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
This is going to be another episode like the, uh, the gay libertarian romance episode

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
where we just stop for a minute and see flashbacks.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Like, this season doesn't have that many fucking episodes.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
We already wasted one doing that.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Now we're doing it again.

19:04.000 --> 19:12.000
Well, so, to their credit, this is pretty much how it went in the game's DLC for Ellie's backstory.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
They went into the mall, they dicked around.

19:15.000 --> 19:21.000
Now, there were enemies in the mall that they fought, but, like, the actual idea of it

19:21.000 --> 19:28.000
being an extended date for two young women who don't know what their sexuality is.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
It's the same story.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
I turned 17 next month. That's when you get your assignment.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
You know what Kwon gave me?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Sewage detail.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
And I'm a proud woman, goddammit. I don't do sewage work. That's for men.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Actually, you know what it is? It's the black Asian...

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Watch as somebody has to do it.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
It's the black Asian racist, uh, war that's going to be happening in the future.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
It's already happening right now.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
No, don't make me touch the boobie.

20:01.000 --> 20:08.000
I do like this. So she didn't run away for ideological reasons or because they were fascist dickbags, but because she was asked to do a dirty job.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Alright.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
I mean, someone has to do it.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Understandable motivation.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
What do you mean, shovel of shit? That's... debasing. Disgraceful. More important than that.

20:20.000 --> 20:26.000
I mean, if this society's anything like real world, you get paid very well. And compensated well for doing a dirty job.

20:26.000 --> 20:33.000
That's the thing, Kibbs. It's not like the real world. You don't get compensated well. You get compensated with you do it or you get shot.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
You know what? What you want to do...

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
I like that. That's a win. You don't get shot.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
You got to look at the bright side of it. You can't be such a pessimist.

20:41.000 --> 20:47.000
In a liberal capitalist society, these jobs get done because you get paid for them.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
And if there's no one who wants to do them, then you have to offer more money.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
And the market kind of balances itself in a sense.

20:54.000 --> 20:59.000
In an actual fascist society, they'll just point the guns at you and say, this is your work detail.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
But then again, so will a communist one, so...

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Same thing in the end.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
I mean, they are the same, yeah.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
God, I hope the zombies eat them both alive.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Patience.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Are you cringing, Arch?

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
What's wrong, Arch? You don't like this?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
There we go.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Oh, fuck.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Yeah, the ink's kind of old, dude.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
My dollar seems like a lot, though.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Pretty stiff.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
Even for 2003, it was a lot, I think.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
It was like a dollar back then, I think.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Awesome.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
Listen, the episode has redeemed itself.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Because arcades were so much fun back in the day.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
You can still find arcades today.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
Man, I recall going to a hotel in like 2015 or something.

22:15.000 --> 22:22.000
And they had like some sort of atrium entertainment area, like down in the lobby.

22:22.000 --> 22:26.000
And there was like a path where you could see the pool, like the hotel's pool.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
So okay, there's a pool.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
There was like a pool table.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
Okay, you could play a game of pool for a dollar or something.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
And then there was like two neglected arcade cabinets in the corner.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
And one of them was broken.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
And the other one was Ms. Pac-Man from a very long time ago.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
And I was like, Jesus, no one's played this in years, have they?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Her pays are pretty cool.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
There's still some around, though.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Not in Canada. Rip.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
I think there's a place in Minnesota like Dave and Busters is what it's called.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
popcorn from 52 years ago.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Mortal Kombat!

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
My dinner's ruined.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
So Naomi, she's also watching this series, too.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
And she gave me this insight.

23:24.000 --> 23:33.000
Her theory as to why they changed the dates of the show to make it so that the apocalypse happened in 2003

23:33.000 --> 23:42.000
and that this is now 2023 is that it made it much easier to get era-appropriate props

23:42.000 --> 23:48.000
because everything that they would get that was era-appropriate would automatically be aged 20 years

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
because it is aged 20 years.

23:51.000 --> 23:57.000
So this Mortal Kombat 2 cabinet looks old because it probably is one of the originals.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
They didn't have to recreate it, you know?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I'm bored.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
Kibs, listen.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
The only reason you're bored right now is because you're too young to enjoy Mortal Kombat.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
I said, damn, he got bored.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Oh, I thought you said you're bored. Oh, sorry.

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
I'm going to have to tell Vee that has this in the show. He'll be happy.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
With my fetish.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
I forgot that that was Vee's fetish.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Wait, what?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
The old Vee lore.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
This is a Vee lore item. Oh, I'm not familiar with it.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Vee lore and vore.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
He likes vore.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Really?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Yeah.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Eat up.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
He had a fur sauna and everything at one point because it wasn't just wool.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
Oh, he still does.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Uh oh, a clicker.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Always a clicker. You're not going to show up?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Is it time?

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
Ooh, they're using the dollhouse for it. That's a pretty good one.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
Very spooky.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
There he is.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Now, remember how long that person has to have been here?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Yeah.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
To become a full mushroom.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
So that means somebody actually waddled in here.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Yep.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
Man, I think what I would miss most in the post-apocalypse is the video games.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
I just love them too much.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
I mean, as long as you have electricity, you can still play, like, physical media games.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
Yeah.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
On consoles and shit.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
That's right.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Arch, consoles would rule the day in the post-apocalypse.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
Luckily, the war with China won't lead to the apocalypse.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
It'll just lead to free and cheap labor.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
That person just fucked up.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
Well, no, it's supposed to be volume 2 with a T.O.O.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
It's a pun book.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
All right, Dev, you're getting beaten too.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
Listen, my pun sense immediately fluted in.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
That's kind of terrible, Dev. I kind of hate you now.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
Isn't the clicker fucking moving faster?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
What's wrong, Arch? Are you bored?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
It's so loud.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
It takes screenshots.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Some of you have been out of Arch's pain.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
Not much, though.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
Watch those screenshots.

26:26.000 --> 26:34.000
See, there's wholesome aspects to this, and there's cringe aspects to this, and they're kind of overlapping.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.000
I'm kind of enjoying it, but it's also kind of boring, yeah?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Oh, shit.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
The pipe bombs.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Don't just...

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
It's just like, I don't mind a romance story, I guess.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
The villain fucking Ted thing was like, okay, I mean, decently done.

26:56.000 --> 27:02.000
But this is just two kids on a date? I'm not interested.

27:02.000 --> 27:06.000
Arch, were you never a kid on a date before?

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
I have experienced this. I don't need to see it on television.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Okay, you could make this interesting.

27:12.000 --> 27:22.000
Like, if you had two really interesting characters doing this stuff, you had a long relationship with both of them, and they had been flirting or whatever, this was the culmination, sure.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
But it isn't. I don't know who rat hair is. I barely know who Ellie is at this point.

27:28.000 --> 27:34.000
I think they have too many flashbacks. They're really relying on you knowing the game.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
Yes, and I don't. I don't care.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
I mean, she's right about that. Ha, got him.

27:48.000 --> 27:54.000
You join the communist revolutionaries and they're already ordering you around and making you go places.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I need to fight for the revolution in some country or some city.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
At least it's not Fedra who orders you to do things.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
You know, like, logistics and maintain the city.

28:02.000 --> 28:10.000
I like how she complains so much about being told to shovel shit, and now she's like, well, I'm told to go to Atlanta, I guess I'll just do it. It's like, okay.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
Oh no, now she's going to feel so bad when she's eaten by a zombie.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Spirit Halloween!

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
That fucking zombie's taking a sweet ass time.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
Listen, Arch, he's been stuck there for a while. His legs are a little stiff.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
He's going to work up that, you know, limber up a little.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
Arch, can't wait to see a black person die.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
I mean, it's true.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Arch can't keep his hatred of them.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
I want to see the white person die too.

28:56.000 --> 29:04.000
It's going to be that scene from American History X, but the guy kicking the black man is going to be a zombie with a mushroom head.

29:07.000 --> 29:11.000
Listen, I read Marx, okay? I get it. Power to the people or whatever.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
I watched RedTube, I know what's going on.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Damn, they groomed her.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
That's what she just said.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Yeah, pretty much.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Yeah, his father.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
They love-bombed me!

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
Damn. Arch, make more whining sounds about how bad this is.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Please.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
I am busy right now.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I'm playing on my phone.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
My shipgirl waifus need me more than this TV show does.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
I knew you were fucking slacking.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Wait, what are you playing, Arch?

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Azur Lane.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Fuck.

30:00.000 --> 30:09.000
This reminds me of, like, some of those best of the worst episodes, I don't know, that are media, where Mike will look over and Rich will just be on his phone playing.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I was like, you fucking cheater!

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
You gotta watch this shit with us!

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Oh, this is the scene.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
I remember this because they're going to get-

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
Yeah, if it's like the game, they're going to-

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Yep, there's the masks.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Okay, they're doing exactly like the game.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
They get the masks, they run around with the masks, they get bit accidentally because they're being stupid with masks.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Because they're dumb kids.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.000
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, this is actually going to be the entire fucking episode.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
It is. This is the episode.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
Listen, Ellie, we're almost of age.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
We gotta learn how to dance on tables.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Okay.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Okay.

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
That was real easy to talk her out of it.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
Okay, you can die now. You've had your kissy thingy.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Yep, here it comes.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
Revolutionary Lesbians in Late-Stage Capitalism.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Oh, no.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Have you guys actually played that?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Let's not talk about that again.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Focus on the fun.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Damn, here's your shot.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
Everyone was bit.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
And we just don't realize it.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Of course.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
Because the camera working intentionally didn't show anything.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000
Yep.

31:47.000 --> 31:51.000
Oh, you know, 9mm bullets, not all that dangerous.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
But a knife to the head, well...

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
Holy shit!

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
She's not happy though, because she's dead.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
You're gonna have to put her down, Ellie.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Why are you smiling?

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Chomp.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Yeah.

32:29.000 --> 32:34.000
Just like with the whole Pablo Escobar, whatever his name was, getting stabbed.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
That didn't happen. You didn't actually shoot that.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
He didn't seem to get his mouth close enough to either of those body parts.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
They didn't. They just pretended it happened.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
Oh wow, now we'll get the shocking revelation that she didn't actually leave anyway.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Didn't you enjoy that flashback?

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
That was totally worth fucking 50 minutes of my existence.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
She just stood there and remembered the whole story.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
And Joel's like, I'm dying, just either help me or leave.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
Hey, calm down Pablo, I'm reminiscing right here.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
I remember being a lesbian because of a DLC they released.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Oh, by the way...

33:24.000 --> 33:32.000
So, I mentioned before, revolutionary lesbians in late stage capitalism.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
That's actually a game you can play. You can download that on Steam if you want.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
No, I don't think I will.

33:39.000 --> 33:45.000
It's not a very good game, I don't know if you can tell.

33:48.000 --> 33:51.000
You know what, they just listened to the federal people. I think they both have lived.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I think that's the message of the story.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.000
Or if they had swept the ball properly.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
Moral of the story is, fascism saves lives.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
That's like the Warhammer 40k moral.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Uh oh, that's a mmm.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
If only you had listened to the Nazis keeping you safe, warm and fed.

34:16.000 --> 34:22.000
The multi-racial, multi-cultural, LGBTQ plus approving Nazis.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
They're very progressive, okay?

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Nazism has come a long way.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
I mean, if you could have Nick Fuentes in your ranks, you were gone for three hours.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
What were you doing?

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
My mouse is getting a tiny bit dirty. I think I might have to go clean it or something.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
You don't get to get out of this that easy, Blondie.

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
Well, Joe, I mean, it's not bleeding at all.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
Actually, I don't think I need to stitch this.

35:01.000 --> 35:05.000
Fine, I don't know what you're being a big baby about.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
Unironically, this is nothing.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.000
Yeah, there's no blood coming out.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
That hurt.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
Yeah, no, you're just adding mania.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Uh, that hurts.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
Yeah, no, there's no blood. The wound is dry, like...

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
And you're sewing it with a needle you found in a fucking cupboard somewhere.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
You're doing a horrible arselet.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
There's probably cordyceps on it, fuck.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
So...

35:42.000 --> 35:48.000
So, how did you enjoy flashback episode number two, guys?

35:49.000 --> 35:52.000
That's really easy to put into words, Dev.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Yeah?

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
I'll be right back. I'm getting a piece of cloth to fucking watch my mouse.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
Far more important. And interesting.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
I guess Arch doesn't have anything to say about it.

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
Well, to be fair, Arch didn't play the game.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
So, it is a different situation.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
I actually played the DLC.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
So did I.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
But did you like the DLC? Because I didn't.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
It was okay. It wasn't as good as the main game.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
I felt like it was like, oh, by the way, Elia's for sure trans, and that's the DLC.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
Not trans, lesbian.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Or lesbian. Whatever.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Listen, names and stuff are hard, okay?

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
You know, it could be lesbian. They might retcon that later.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
But either way, she's lesbian.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Yes.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
My memory, I'm old man memory now.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
But, like, I just remember the DLC being kind of like,

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
Ellie's a lesbian now. Wow, isn't that amazing?

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
And it's like, I'm playing the DLC and I was like,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
yeah, but like, this is kind of boring.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Just like the DLC was.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Because the DLC was just kind of boring, too.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
It didn't really add anything fun.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
Yeah, I kind of agree. When it comes to the game,

36:59.000 --> 37:03.000
the actual DLC itself wasn't, like,

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
the levels were just kind of samey and they didn't really do anything with them.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
And you only play as Ellie. There's no Joel.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
It's just Ellie because it's her flashback.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
And I think, like, it was one of the first instances of,

37:16.000 --> 37:19.000
let's see if woke stuff sells.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.000
Let's sell a DLC where we're only selling the fact that

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
Ellie is going to be confirmed a lesbian.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
And that's it.

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
And they didn't really, like, they didn't put anything else that was fun in it.

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
For me, when I played it, that was kind of all I got out of it.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
I didn't really care at the time and I still don't.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
It's like, OK, Ellie's a lesbian, but like,

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
at the end of the day, I want my money back because the experience of the DLC.

37:43.000 --> 37:48.000
Like, to be blunt, like, the DLC added a bunch of rehashed, like,

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
like what felt like rehashed recycled assets

37:51.000 --> 37:55.000
for a couple of levels that just really didn't add anything.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
Yeah.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
And it was like at that point, by the time I'd beaten the game The Last of Us,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
I was already kind of bored of the gameplay loop.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
It's like more of that just wasn't enough.

38:04.000 --> 38:08.000
I personally have mixed feelings about this episode because it,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
in my opinion, it wasn't very interesting.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
It was a second and another flashback episode.

38:14.000 --> 38:19.000
However, if you were a Last of Us purist,

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
a Last of Us mega fan, you know, and you wanted to...

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
You probably already don't like the show, though.

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
Well, if you're, no, no, if you're a purist,

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
you're going to want it to be exactly like the video game.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
Yeah, you're going to want the mushrooms back and the, you know,

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
I agree with that. I agree with that.

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
But, but, but here's the thing.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
This, this episode, for better or worse,

38:42.000 --> 38:45.000
was like the DLC that it's based on.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
And someone who really is invested in these characters

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
and these stories in these games would probably like this episode

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
just because of that. It's like, okay, no, this is the story.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
It's properly adapted. Okay.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
Now you can not like the story looking at it from a non-fan's point of view,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
like Arches and fair enough.

39:02.000 --> 39:07.000
But I think, I think you can't, you can't come at this one with like,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
Oh my God, they changed it and made it worse.

39:09.000 --> 39:12.000
You can't make that argument this time because it is accurate.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Well, yeah. I mean, the only thing,

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
the only thing I saw like major lore break in this one

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
was the fact that when the zombie was going after Ellie,

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
you could see the little tentacles come out of its mouth for a second,

39:23.000 --> 39:27.000
which is not canon. But beyond that, like the biting,

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
like the whole sequence, that's pretty on point.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
The issue is, is like, even if you're a purist,

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
I don't think purists will be watching at this point.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
The purists would have already tuned out because it's,

39:37.000 --> 39:41.000
it's not a pure, it's not a pure replica.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
It's possible. How about you, Lilith? How'd you feel about this episode?

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
I haven't played the DLC, but like in the time I did watch it,

39:48.000 --> 39:53.000
it was like a very long time ago. So like,

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
it's kind of about the story beats I remember and like, you know,

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
they wanted to adopt the DLC into the story and that's fine.

40:02.000 --> 40:10.000
Like it gives the viewers who don't know the story or haven't played the game,

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
a bit of an insight into Ellie's backstory.

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
Like some people might think it's unnecessary and like,

40:18.000 --> 40:23.000
it doesn't feel like extremely pertinent to the story so far,

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
at least from what we've seen, like next episode might change her mind.

40:28.000 --> 40:34.000
Like her girlfriend might be important in shaping her character or something,

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
but like that remains to be seen.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
Well, I guess we'll just have to watch on, but if not,

40:41.000 --> 40:46.000
then like other people have said, like it's,

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
it would be pretty pointless for the most part or at least padding,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
some might say.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
Yep. Yeah, it definitely feels like padding.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
And you know, if we count the other, the other flashback episode,

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
we've now had two episodes of padding out of seven episodes.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
And isn't there only nine episodes in this season?

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
I mean, if they want to like self-contained like stories,

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
then just let that be an episode. I mean, that's fine.

41:15.000 --> 41:20.000
Like I don't have anything against that, but like,

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
like you said, there's like not that much, that many episodes left.

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
I mean, they're taking a risk and you know what I'd rather they,

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
if they are going to get into it, I'd rather dedicate the time to do it.

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
Right. Then to not do it at all, if they're going to do it anyways.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
So, yeah. And you know what, to this episode's credit,

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
it is more central to the story than,

41:46.000 --> 41:51.000
than the Bill and Frank story because those characters don't come back again.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.000
Yeah. And with this one, you could actually like,

41:55.000 --> 42:01.000
it shows off how Ellie got bitten and found out that she's immune

42:01.000 --> 42:08.000
and also goes a bit to her past, which is, you know, fine from a narrative perspective.

42:08.000 --> 42:13.000
Yeah, definitely. I think that's definitely a valid point because this episode,

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
unlike the Bill and Fred one. Oh God, I already forgot the other guy.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
It's Frank. It's Frank, you fucking homophobe, Kibbs.

42:20.000 --> 42:24.000
Kibbs, how can you be a self-hating homophobe, man?

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
Wow. But this episode, yes.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.000
This episode actually has far more plot relevance than Bill and Frank ever did.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
Because Bill and Frank was a side story that had nothing to do with the main characters

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
and like they're dead and then they waddled away.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
Yep. And then they immediately lose Bill's truck, like the next episode.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
So it's like, oh, well, okay.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
That was the whole episode for a plot device, for a truck,

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
for a thing that we're going to use for like the first five minutes of this episode.

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
And then just fucking gone.

42:58.000 --> 43:04.000
Arch, did you actually want to give your take on this episode or?

43:04.000 --> 43:11.000
I can, with great and everlasting eternal joy, inform you and everyone else that my mouse is now clean.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I see. Okay.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
All right, we can move on to the next one.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
So that was episode seven and now we have episode eight to talk about

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
or to watch and then talk about, I guess.

43:20.000 --> 43:26.000
But first, real quick, I had this episode spoiled to me, the one that we just watched.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
Sorry, I knew it was coming. I didn't reveal it.

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
I didn't want to break the magic of this amazing show for everyone.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
But I knew that this was going to be the LEDLC lesbian romance.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
And then they get bit at the end episode.

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
And the reason why I knew that is because of this article.

43:45.000 --> 43:59.000
Basically, do you recall how Ben Shapiro and some of the other like rightoid political pundits talked about how they shoehorned in gay men into The Last of Us with Bill and Frank, even though they were already gay?

43:59.000 --> 44:10.000
Right. Basically, the same type of complaint came out of, you know, rightoid YouTube channels about they they added more gay people to the last was how could they do this?

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
And it's like, you guys, these people were always gay.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
And of course, that meant to, you know, more people on the left on Twitter making fun of them.

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
And, you know, you everyone knows how this sort of news cycle works on the Internet nowadays, right?

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
Someone gets outraged. The other side laughs and says they're ignorant.

44:26.000 --> 44:32.000
And it's just it's just a constant echoing drama that just goes for forever.

44:32.000 --> 44:42.000
All right. And so once it came out that people on the right were not happy with this episode and not because it was poorly written and poorly paced

44:42.000 --> 44:49.000
and didn't really fit with the rest of the story and just wasn't you know, wasn't a very good episode all in all.

44:49.000 --> 45:05.000
But because it was lesbians, the actress who played Ellie's girlfriend, I forget her name, Riley Storm Reid, she said she isn't concerned with homophobic The Last of Us fans because we are telling important stories.

45:05.000 --> 45:11.000
It's 2023. If you're concerned about who I love, then I need you to get your priorities straight.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.000
It's current year, guys.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
I thought Stormy Reid was a porn actress.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
Yeah, yeah. Me, too. Isn't that a porn name?

45:21.000 --> 45:27.000
Yeah, it's like, I mean, it's fair if she's upset that people are upset about this.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
Like, it is a pretty dumb thing to cry over.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
The objection to this exists on TV.

45:33.000 --> 45:41.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly right. Like, you know, the objection to this to this episode isn't lesbians exist.

45:41.000 --> 45:48.000
It is that it's a it's another flashback in a show that's already very slow and needs to have a bit more meat on the bone.

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
That's the objection. The lesbian part doesn't really matter that much.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
I know that I know our you're like making fun of him a bit, but it really doesn't matter.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
Like, but some people for we're just basically it's turned into another culture war thing.

46:01.000 --> 46:08.000
The thing is, it's a bit of a derpy situation because there are a lot of I don't know if I'd call them right.

46:08.000 --> 46:16.000
But there are people on YouTube who do entertainment commentary stuff for pop culture commentary along the lines of what I do.

46:16.000 --> 46:21.000
But a lot of them do pretend that they know what they're talking about.

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000
And so they go like, oh, they put they put gays in this because they realize that's a that's a talking point, right?

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
You don't like forced woke ism gays woke. Right. So therefore it's bad.

46:31.000 --> 46:35.000
But if you actually did some research, you realize, you know, they were always gay.

46:35.000 --> 46:43.000
There's been held the last of us. I don't bother covering this specifically on news about it because one, I don't know about it.

46:43.000 --> 46:47.000
Two, I don't care about it. And three, as far as I'm concerned, it's a woke is property already.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
So I'm like, oh, you know, woke thing.

46:51.000 --> 46:58.000
But I see because that's the thing. I don't mind there being gays and TV show.

46:58.000 --> 47:05.000
I applauded the the Bill and Ted romance with the caveat, so long as it didn't screw over the rest of the show, which in part it does.

47:05.000 --> 47:11.000
And now there's a second filler episode and I'm kind of just sitting here like, wow, this is getting very boring.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.000
That's my contention with it. But yes, a lot of people do.

47:15.000 --> 47:21.000
They try to jump on the bandwagon that frankly passed a year or two ago.

47:21.000 --> 47:32.000
Yeah, yeah, I think so. Like, no, no offense to guys like the quartering, but his his whole thing seems to have hit its peak a little bit ago.

47:32.000 --> 47:40.000
And now it's kind of like on its way down in terms of what's popular on YouTube, you know, and also just Jeremy say this.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
Now, it sounds like I'm starting drama.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
He had no idea. Wow.

47:46.000 --> 47:52.000
Arch spoke the truth and arch versus Jeremy. I mean, this was bound to happen, though.

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
I have I have unironically seen this because because it is the thing, right?

47:57.000 --> 48:00.000
Because the left did this to say they've always been woke.

48:00.000 --> 48:05.000
That was always been woke. No, it hasn't. It's literally the same knee jerk reaction thing.

48:05.000 --> 48:10.000
Was it the oh, God, there was a show a little while ago.

48:10.000 --> 48:18.000
I can't there was one show or was it a game with everyone on like our side, quote unquote, said it was going to be awful.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
And it turned out it was actually pretty OK. And everyone was kind of coping about it.

48:22.000 --> 48:27.000
What was that? That sounds it does sound familiar. It wasn't Hogwarts.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
It was before that. It was a game. I think it was a game.

48:30.000 --> 48:37.000
I think it was a game. Yeah, it might have been a game because I remember everyone's like, oh, no, no movie, movie Avatar, The Way of Goddamn Water.

48:37.000 --> 48:41.000
That was it. I didn't see that. Was it actually good?

48:41.000 --> 48:45.000
I don't know. I'm Cindy there. But I remember that everyone's talking about like, yeah, this is going to bomb.

48:45.000 --> 48:50.000
This is going to be awful. Like he's talking about toxic masculinity is going to be terrible.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
And I didn't comment on it at all because I hadn't seen anything of it.

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
And if I don't know anything about a thing, I'll probably usually just be like, yeah, that doesn't sound good.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
But there wasn't anything about toxic masculinity in the movie, though.

49:03.000 --> 49:12.000
No, I don't think. Oh, yeah. But the director had said so specifically that he wanted to fight toxic masculinity and he didn't want guns and et cetera.

49:12.000 --> 49:18.000
Fuck. Also, the the pregnant female Navi warrior.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
But by and large, the movie turned out to be OK.

49:21.000 --> 49:28.000
And it's like, OK, so that reminds me of like pregnant Spider-Man who's like swinging around on.

49:28.000 --> 49:34.000
I was like, it looks ridiculous. Fuck.

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
But the way of water ended up being enormous economic success. So a lot of people were kind of coping about it.

49:39.000 --> 49:46.000
And I get it. But like you do have to it is, again, that idea that we are on the defensive all the time.

49:46.000 --> 49:52.000
If you're on the defensive, you have to try and cancel things. You have to protect yourself against those things by attacking them.

49:52.000 --> 50:00.000
We're not there anymore. We are genuinely in a position where we can we can be offensive.

50:00.000 --> 50:05.000
Yes. Yeah. Anyway, you know, we don't have to be on the defensive.

50:05.000 --> 50:11.000
If way of water turns out to be good. Great. If Hogwarts turns out to be good. Fantastic.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
If it turns out to be shit. Well, I'm bastard then, too. Yeah. Yeah, I completely agree.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
I was on E-FAP yesterday when we were talking about Atomic Heart.

50:20.000 --> 50:30.000
And I made the point that I really enjoyed the the over sexualized fridge girlfriend where she liked her.

50:30.000 --> 50:35.000
I fucking I hated the fact that they moved away from her. Like occasionally you would just get generic voice.

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000
I'm like, oh, fridge waifu. I know, Kibbs, you've played it a little.

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
Did you play it on the card? Yeah, I watched some gameplays of it. Yeah.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
OK, so so there's there's the one fridge that you buy your items and stuff from or you upgrade your stuff at.

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
And it has the A.I. it's like a horny, super horny robot. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
So people were saying that, like, it was problematic and it was sexist.

50:59.000 --> 51:07.000
And I was just like, listen, I like this. Yeah, I like this, even though it was kind of over the top and cringe sometimes.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
Because because it's. Yes. Yeah. But but here's the thing.

51:11.000 --> 51:20.000
It's because it's something that a woke developer wouldn't do and that they would they would in fact be very angry if it came out and it did come out.

51:20.000 --> 51:27.000
And it's like, oh, this is actually a breath of fresh air. People who don't care about about appearing a certain way in public.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.000
They just say, we'll just we'll just put sexy robots in the game. Fuck it.

51:30.000 --> 51:39.000
We'll just put like like I mean, I saw one Twitter streamer like turned the game off because because the main character called a robot a gear head.

51:39.000 --> 51:45.000
And she said that she didn't want to promote slurs against robots. Anyway, this is this is way off topic.

51:45.000 --> 51:51.000
I guess the point the point that I was getting at is that it was refreshing for how flawed atomic art was.

51:51.000 --> 52:00.000
It was refreshing to see some of those things that woke creators, woke artists, woke people who make TV shows or games or movies or whatever.

52:00.000 --> 52:05.000
They wouldn't do that stuff. And it was refreshing to see it again.

52:05.000 --> 52:12.000
In terms of The Last of Us, this this this is a more, as you say, are two more woke property.

52:12.000 --> 52:18.000
But at least the show is, to its credit, at least somewhat accurate. That's nice.

52:18.000 --> 52:22.000
But yeah, I'm not I'm not at this point in the show, I'm not expecting anything great.

52:22.000 --> 52:25.000
So I've got episode about episode eight here.

52:25.000 --> 52:33.000
Episode eight is the second to last episode of the season. For some reason, it's a nine episode season, I think, which is kind of strange.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
Lucky me.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
A show made for the fans at least has that going for it.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
You know, at least it's made for the people who are supposed to enjoy it.

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
I've noticed that they've completely stopped with that.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
How the virus or how the mushroom started series of flashbacks.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
It would have been nice if they had one of those every episode.

52:54.000 --> 52:58.000
You know, God, no, we don't need any more.

52:58.000 --> 53:03.000
I would have enjoyed like little hints of the before times before every episode, as long as it was relevant to the episode.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
That's just the problem is, is we've mucked around for two whole episodes.

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
I want to just Joel and Ellie do Joel and Ellie stuff.

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
It's a simple request.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
I want to see more Joel and Ellie.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.000
They've replaced little flashbacks with full episodes of flashbacks.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.000
Yeah, they're not little anymore, Dev. They're not little anymore.

53:21.000 --> 53:25.000
I can't wait till we get like flashbacks inside of flashbacks.

53:25.000 --> 53:30.000
Hey, we're not at that point yet. I don't think there's enough episodes for that.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
Executive director Neil Druckleman.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Fucking Druckleman, dude.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
He's like, bro, I'm going to ruin this franchise.

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
It's like, OK, fair enough. I mean, I can't really call you there, dude.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
You do you.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
You own it.

53:46.000 --> 53:47.000
That's true.

53:47.000 --> 53:51.000
Your toy. You want to break it? Go for it.

53:51.000 --> 53:58.000
Joel and Ellie, please.

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
Hey, this is like an average Canadian town.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
This actually looks like like my town, my hometown.

54:11.000 --> 54:21.000
Jesus saying, behold, the tabernacle God is with men.

54:21.000 --> 54:27.000
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Crazy Catholics.

54:29.000 --> 54:36.000
Oh, is this going to be like the winter cultists?

54:36.000 --> 54:44.000
This was a part of the game.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
Is this the religion is bad portion of this video game?

54:48.000 --> 54:57.000
I think so. They find a cult at some point and Joel kills them all because, of course, it's a video game.

54:57.000 --> 55:08.000
I love killing cults in video games like doing like the Boomer cannibal cult.

55:08.000 --> 55:23.000
Side story in GTA five and ending up killing them all as Trevor was really fun.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
It's kind of cold.

55:25.000 --> 55:29.000
You got to wait for the ground is too cold to dig.

55:29.000 --> 55:35.000
Yeah, I will bury your father in the spring.

55:35.000 --> 55:41.000
That's how it is here, man. I'm sure that's how it is in Norway, too.

55:41.000 --> 55:47.000
Well, then we have advanced technology called digging machines.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.000
OK, we have those here, too, and in bigger cities, they do that.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.000
But like in my hometown, they just had like a hut.

55:54.000 --> 55:59.000
They put the bodies in and to wait until spring and it would be cold enough to keep them in there.

55:59.000 --> 56:05.000
You go in there, Bob. We don't have the technology to bury you yet.

56:05.000 --> 56:12.000
It always triggers me when people are in cold environments like this and their front is entirely open.

56:12.000 --> 56:17.000
Now go get it. We're going home. You guys should be wearing toques or something.

56:17.000 --> 56:21.000
Like at least zip up your jacket like they put it. No, put on your hood.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
Put on your hood, Nick. Don't worry, Joe.

56:26.000 --> 56:32.000
I'm going to go hunt the deer. I don't know how to dress it or what parts they eat or anything like that.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
But I'm going to hunt the deer. I mean, it's fine. And in survival situation, you don't know how to do that.

56:36.000 --> 56:41.000
You might as well fucking try. I can barely use this fucking gun.

56:41.000 --> 56:47.000
You're barely twice your size.

56:47.000 --> 56:51.000
Fire it like that underarm. It'll be a good way to get rid of that scope.

56:51.000 --> 56:57.000
My favorite is when you see people who have the butt of the gun over their shoulder.

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
And that's my favorite. So it's facing downward.

57:01.000 --> 57:06.000
No, no. So you've got the actual like butt of the gun, but they put it on top of their shoulder.

57:06.000 --> 57:12.000
Oh, my God. Yeah. Jesus. You know, if you shoot that rabbit with that, you're going to have very little rabbit.

57:12.000 --> 57:17.000
Yeah. You're going to have a good, fluffy hole, though.

57:17.000 --> 57:23.000
Oh, and that gun just went off.

57:23.000 --> 57:27.000
I think in the game, Ellie was using a bow by now.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
I guess they didn't want to level her up that way. You have to teach the actress how to use a bow.

57:32.000 --> 57:38.000
Yeah. You also need the arm strength because those aren't easy.

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
Actually, I think the person who plays Ellie came out as non-binary.

57:43.000 --> 57:49.000
Like in real life. That kind of makes sense, though. So does that mean?

57:49.000 --> 57:54.000
What's the gender neutral term for an actor? It's not actress.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
It's Jesus objects.

57:58.000 --> 58:04.000
What do you want from the actor? I think after itself is a gender neutral.

58:04.000 --> 58:09.000
Yes, I don't think it is. It might be. Yeah, I prefer it.

58:09.000 --> 58:16.000
Jesus. Oh, you did it.

58:16.000 --> 58:22.000
Well, quote close. I mean, I'm surprised that she actually got the shot off is what I mean.

58:22.000 --> 58:28.000
People are jerking triggers bleed out.

58:28.000 --> 58:34.000
Well, actually, there's a fascinating little thing that happens when it's nice and cold outside.

58:34.000 --> 58:40.000
The blood after a while will actually begin to freeze and clog up the wound.

58:40.000 --> 58:46.000
Yep. Really nasty.

58:46.000 --> 58:52.000
Quickly, whoever shot, it's probably nearby.

58:52.000 --> 58:58.000
I don't know where they're going to go.

58:58.000 --> 59:06.000
Oh, you can't drag this back on your own.

59:07.000 --> 59:11.000
We're not a charity. We we can trade you for some of the deer we have.

59:11.000 --> 59:16.000
What do you need? We have boots, medicine.

59:16.000 --> 59:21.000
Like for infections. We do back in our village.

59:21.000 --> 59:25.000
You're welcome to follow us. I'm not following. Let's ride over there.

59:25.000 --> 59:32.000
Wait, where's your fingers? You have a trigger discipline? No, no, no.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.000
For a second, there was like, oh, my God, they actually told her about trigger discipline.

59:35.000 --> 59:41.000
Now she's wearing her gloves to Padres living dangerously right about now.

59:41.000 --> 59:47.000
That's your dad's gun. You're the one that's sick.

59:47.000 --> 59:55.000
That's why you're out here on your own. Well, look, it's a four mile round trip back to our settlement.

59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
It's going to be a while before James gets back. I have some oil and matches in my pack.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Take shelter. Start a fire.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I'd suggest you start dressing that deer because, you know, it's cold outside.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:18.000
You know, I know how this turns out, so I can't exactly blame her.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
But they're religious and post apocalypse dev. They're evil, obviously.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Yes, obviously, obviously. But he's been nothing but friendly this whole time.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I honestly mean, you know, I feel like this is probably an overreaction from L.A.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
And for what it's worth, it will be proven not to be. But still, like right now, it's true.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
There's a reason to be cautious here. It is post apocalypse.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.000
What hostile people have they met? So they ran into the communist commune and they were not very friendly.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Wasn't my choice. They ran into Tommy's group and his mock Mongolians and they were friendly.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000
So I guess she's 50 50ing it a bit, but better to be safe than sorry.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Yeah. Well, you sort of kind of got me there. I am a preacher, but just pretty standard Bible stuff.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
What the whole world ended and you still believe that shit.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I actually started believing after the world ended. Found God after the apocalypse.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Oh, God, why? That's how I ended up with our flock. Sometimes people find God.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I imagine God is just like in the fridge and it's like, God, why?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
And he just turns around like, oh, shit, I wasn't paying attention. What happened?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:34.000
And as we wanted, we picked up from stick in his mouth. Turns out he was murdered by this crazy man.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And get this. That crazy man was traveling with a little girl.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:52.000
At the same group. Did you bring the medicine? Yeah, but throw it to her. David.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Makes me wonder, though, if they've got rifles aplenty, handguns, why they didn't send any of that with the pilfering party.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:10.000
But, yeah, the story demanded they be poorly armed, I guess those four guys attacked Joel first.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Right. Yeah, because they had their backs turned. Yeah. Yep. They charged him.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Do you know how this works, Ellie? Joel, where the fuck do I put this?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000
I don't know. He's allergic to penicillin.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I'll just stick it right here. That'll work. Right there. All the way in.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Just pump it straight into his internal organs. Good.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I knew she'd been better off either coating the wound or putting it in their arm, but hey, details, it works.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
You know, I'm just happy we're back on with the story. Yes.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And that it is, you know, more or less what the game was again.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I know I'm like a broken record on that, but it's refreshing to see.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
It's a story. It has characters. I even know some of them.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Lilith and Kibs, how much do you two remember about the religious cultists in this game?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I don't remember nothing at this point. No? Were they cannibals?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
I remember the ending. I don't think these were the cannibals. I don't think.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
What is it?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Are you sure? Maybe they are the cannibals.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:47.000
What do you think that guy was? They just got a deer, so I don't see why they'd eat each other right now.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
We could eat the deer, or Bob.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Oh, well, that one father just died, remember?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Yep. I know, but again...

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
No, because here's the deer. Here's the deer.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Ah. So these are the cannibals. Maybe it is, Bob.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Yeah.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
To be fair, if you're starving and you have a dead body...

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Yeah.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I can see the argument. It is, however, what we call a long-term health risk.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
And avoid the brain stems.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Yes. We found a girl who was with the man who took Alec from us.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
How did he hear a rumor when he just got back?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I don't know.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
When the sun rises, I'll lead a group out to pick up her trail.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Well, the other dude did come back for a moment, I guess, maybe?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Or...

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Because he did get the penicillin.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
And we'll bring that man to justice.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
You should kill him. You should kill both of them.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Ugh.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Women. Always so bloodthirsty.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Jesus.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Now you know where the back is.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
The Lord speaketh of the back of his hand.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I'm sorry I had to hit you, child, but we had to establish that we were actually the bad guys.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Now go on and eat your own dad.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
It's in the soup.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Uh-huh. Your father is soup.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Thank you.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
What do you mean you don't have a dad anymore? He's right here, points to Platter.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Blesseth with Christ, the living bread.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Amen.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Yes, he withal eating the body of Christ, I think.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Yep.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.000
And the way that they're just focusing on the food, yeah, this is the cannibals, okay.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Making it gross.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Bob was delicious.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
I mean, I can understand a desperate situation, but it sucks.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Well, it's the thing. If they ate him because they were out of food, then fair enough.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Yeah, they didn't just, like, kill a random person. He was already dead.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Waste that whatnot.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Mm-hmm.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
If they eat random people for fists and giggles, however, it'll be different.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I'll inject it right there again. It'll be okay. Ah, fuck.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
That's not how this works, Ellie?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
That is not how that works, no.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
But she's filling up his stomach cavity with lots of penicillin.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
To be fair, you know, it'll be absorbed through the skin eventually.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Ellie got there.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Dude, eat your horse at this point. You're gonna be camped out here for a while.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Ellie doesn't know how to brush her tracks in the snow.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Wait, wait, wait. You can't feed a horse snow. You can't eat snow yourself.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Well, you can. I wouldn't recommend it in the long run, but again, if you're desperate.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.000
You have to let the snow melt into water first before you drink it.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Like, it's not gonna hydrate you like that,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
because the amount of energy that your body uses up to melt it.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I don't know what kind of snow you have, Dev.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
There's something about snow causing dehydration long-term.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Long-term probably is.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Now, if you were smart, you'd boil it first, because, uh,

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
well, there are many wonderful things that live in snow.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Ah, yes.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
We're a stealthy hunting party, hunting a dangerous man who kills one of us,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
which is why we're walking in the middle of the fucking streets.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Daylight.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
You wouldn't want to be sneaky or anything. That'd be stupid.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Just another mouth to feed, or another hole to breed.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Jesus.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I couldn't resist. It was too good. It rhymed and everything.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Down here, you fucking kill them. You got it?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Joel.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Joel, do not fall asleep.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
He's like, bro, I hurt. Am I everything hurts?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Also, I'm going to say, oh god.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Well, if they didn't know I was here before, that'll do it.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Yep.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Come on.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
I mean, has the horse been eating?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Uh, no.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
To be fair, I like...

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Must have packed horse food. Feed.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Listen, this is fake Hollywood snows.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
There's probably some grass for it to munch somewhere.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
It's like bushes inside.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Fuckers!

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Ancient Mongolian horse gunnery.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Keep cutting fuckers.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Yep.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Now they can eat the horse.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
They've solved the food situation.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Yeah, didn't this guy want Ellie to, like, be his underage wife or something?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I think that might have... I can't remember.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
It's been too long since I played the game.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Damn, that's kind of creepy, though.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:07.000
It sounds like something that's going on, though, doesn't it?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Of course.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
The rest of you, stay here, go door to door.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
You so hungry for vengeance?

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Deliver it.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Jesus.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
They got a creepy looking guy to play this part.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Wow, just because he's ginger deaf, wow, a little bit of racism.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Well, at least he plays the creepy look well, I guess.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
He has...

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Soulless eyes, is that what you're going for, Dev? Jesus.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
God damn it!

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Get your knife ready.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Man, Ellie should have at least, like, dragged him underneath the stairs or something.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I have no senses. Ice approaching.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Hmm, a bloody mattress. I should continue.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I should definitely not call with my friends, since this is definitely not where he is.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
He wants to kill, though.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Also, that beard, you deserve this.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.000
Now you have more people to eat.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Hungry.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Why do you think he sent them on their little vengeance quest?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
He's racking up food.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
This is quite, uh, quite slow.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Joel can barely fucking do it.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Jesus.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Good job, man, who couldn't move five seconds ago.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
He probably fucked up his stitches, though.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Stitches?

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.000
The stitches.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Alright, she did...

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Well, did she even have threads, though?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
She's just stabbing him for just some giggles.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Oh my god, bro.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
No, she found threads. She found threads in the last episode.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
You're too busy cleaning your mouse.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
He was so busy playing his phone game that he didn't even watch the other episode.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
I mean, I don't even blame him.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
At the end of the flashback, she found a thread.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Oh god, this is going to get weird, isn't it?

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Yeah.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
I think this is the...

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
The veterinarian's place in town.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
They really make it look like the place in the game.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Oh, hey.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I just realized.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I was prophetic.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Another mouse to feed, another hole to breathe.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I called it.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Hey, listen to me.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
It's okay, he's just setting up one of those Deep South child beauty pageants.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.000
That's what he wants her for.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Timothy.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Oh, so long as there's nothing weird, I guess.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I like how they actually split up.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
These guys deserve what's coming.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Yeah.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Timothy.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Well, can I park with him?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
It's always a good idea to split up and to cover my ground, okay?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I like how Joel's just killing them all.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
He's barely conscious and he's like, nope.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000
My non-toxic masculinity will pull me through this.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I'm going to kill all these misogynists.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I don't know any girl.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Oh, Jesus!

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Michael.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000
He can't help you.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
You focus right here or I'll pop your fucking kneecap off.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Jesus.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I think this was in the game, right?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Yeah.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Just interrogating them.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Yeah, this is from the game.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Interrogating to me.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Oh, the town.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
What town?

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Cooper Lane.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
You got to get directions out of him?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Oh, no.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.000
He knows we're civil, I guess.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000
We got a map.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Jesus Christ.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Non-toxic masculinity.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000
It's okay.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I believe him.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Jesus.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Yeah, that's pretty much how it went in the game.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000
You just got to inject it right in there, Arch.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Here, have some people soup.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Or me.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Just in case it wasn't obvious enough.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
That's for the brain dead of yours.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
For what it's worth, this is just dear meat, I swear.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
You're going to chop me up into little pieces.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
If you want to judge me.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Judge you?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
You're eating people, you sick fuck!

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
It was a last resort.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
You think it doesn't shame me?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
But what was I supposed to do?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Let them starve?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
These people who put their lives in my hands?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Who expect me to keep them safe?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Who love me?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Yeah, maybe.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
I don't know if I agree with Ellie here.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
No, that's a retarded position.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I'm like, yeah, you should just all have died.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Why?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
You remind me of me.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
You're a natural leader.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.000
You're smart.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Loyal.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Violent.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Violent.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Wow.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
You read a lot of that script off screen, didn't you?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
You have a violent heart.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
And I should know.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I'm a little bit of a user myself, actually.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
They need God.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
They need heaven.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
They need...

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.000
They need a father.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
You don't.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
You're beyond that.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
You are fatherless.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I'm surrounded by sheep.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Fatherless behavior.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Damn, he bonded hard over this chick.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
You met, like, five minutes.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Like I said, loyal.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Yeah.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
He just wants to bone her.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
That's what this is.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I can tell the others to stop looking for him.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:01.000
The script says I have a weird attraction to young girls.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Well, better roll with it.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Really?

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
They're paying me.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I just let him go?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Yes.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
If he leaves us in peace, they will just let him go.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Well...

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
They do what I tell them to do.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
That bridge is already burnt.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
I can't get what they're doing here, but Jesus Christ, he's...

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
This is some love at first sight level shit here.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Like, I've always wooed you.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
We can be man and wife.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
We can lead this group of crazy people together.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
We grow.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Spread out.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
And we do whatever we need.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
A little bit of zero to sixty, but alright.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I think it works this time, because he's just clearly nuts.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I suppose, but like, the only thing he's doing that's nuts is this.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Like, the other decisions have been fairly irrational.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
The nuts part is just that he's like, alright, kiddie, yes.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
This is a deep south marriage, guys.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Like, the very first scene...

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Oh!

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Oh, God!

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Yep, he was thinking with his dick.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000
That's grody.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000
He deserved that.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000
You little cunt.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Let's see what I go tell the others now.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Ellie.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000
What?

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
What?

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Tell them that Ellie is a little girl who broke her fucking finger!

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000
How did you put it?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Tiny little pieces?

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
That's funny.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
You say, well, where?

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
We chopped up our pieces.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Most unfortunate.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Damn.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
You see, I wouldn't have done what she did.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
I would have pretended to play along for a while.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000
You would have become, like, the priest's concubine until you could escape?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
I could just, like, stab him.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000
In the middle of the night?

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
While he's sleeping.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Yeah.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
And get away.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000
The thing is, you can just also wait until he buys it, and then you sneak out.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Oh, okay.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Yeah, at the very least, wait until he unlocks the cell door.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Yeah.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
This was, in my opinion, the most unbelievable part of the game.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Because Joel is still fucked up.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Like, from his wound.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
He has a murder rampage.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
He just murders fucking everyone.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
It's like, alright, alright, dude.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
That's a bit too video game for me.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
He had a bleeding, septic, fucking stomach wound about an hour ago.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Yeah.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Mark, you got better, okay?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
And Joe Allen.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
The story kind of demands that he be a little bit more effective.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
He pressed the heal button, Arch.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Clearly, you don't know anything.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
He found one of the healing packs.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
He held down the X button.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
He's invoking, as I said, his non-toxic masculinity.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Listen, I found a health pack. I'm good.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
There's the horse.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I guess they'll eat that later.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:23.000
You really should leave that outside, actually, in these circumstances.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
It'll freeze better.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
And there's the people that they're eating.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
It's ganger ape time.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Fun for all the family.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:43.000
What?

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Oh, no, they're just gonna eat her.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Well, I suppose that's merciful.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Don't do it! Please, don't do it! Please, don't!

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
You had your chance!

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Don't! I'm infected!

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I'm infected.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
And now so are you.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Roll up my sleeve. Look at it.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Look at it!

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
It's part of your hair.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
What did you say?

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Everything happens for a reason, right?

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
I wonder if she can infect people.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Oh, shit!

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Ooh, damn!

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
That looks pretty real to me, too.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
That was pretty impressive.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Not only did they let her do that, but he missed a series of point-blank shots.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Good job, both of you.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I mean, we've kind of established he's a Pascafist.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
He's not very good at gun.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
It's gun stat, super low.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
It's charisma stat, also low.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Unseriously removes it.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Aw, more food for later.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Oh my god, burn him.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Lul, that'd be so funny.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Burn his dick.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Oh, no, that's a video game torch.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Yep, that's gonna catch.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Awfully quick.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Yep, there it goes.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Yeah, don't even bother trying to put that out.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
That's a video game torch, my dude.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000
It's gonna burn.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
I do love how he doesn't even try.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
He doesn't say anything.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.000
He doesn't call for help.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Like, bye!

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Damn.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000
It's a boss fight, Arch.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
It's a video game.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
And he realizes this.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
I'm the boss in a video game.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
This is ambiance.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Holy shit, it's overbur-

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Wow, the fucking beeps are-

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Listen, they doused it in gasoline before they started living here.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Part of the ritual, okay?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I actually really like that they're doing this.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Because you did have to basically take this guy on with no weapons as Ellie.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Or are you just that fucking special?

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
No one likes being humiliated, Ellie.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
You don't know how good I am!

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
That's not true.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Some people have that as a fetish.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
You don't know what I could have given you!

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
This guy's the ultimate nice guy!

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
He's like, I'm super simpy!

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I'm gonna miss you.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Ellie...

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Hold it down, you trust me.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
You whispered her name in a very creepy fashion.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Fuck!

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Yeah.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Yeah.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Resistance only makes me harder.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Go, go, run!

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Oh no.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I think it's weird.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Ha! Told you.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Oh no.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Oh man.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
There's no fear in love.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
You're gonna fucking hit him.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Please.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
I love how this guy...

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Like, the entire building is on fire.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Like, he's fighting a chick with a big cleaver.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
And all I can think of is like, hmm, he'd be hard.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Ha ha ha ha!

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Yes, yes, we got it.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
We get it.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
He was a bad person.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Show me the body.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
Now I don't require too much makeup.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Makeup?

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000
It would require them to make, like, a prop.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Because there wouldn't be much of that face left.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000
It was a nice play.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Bit too expensive.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
See, that was such a missed opportunity.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Get off of me!

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Get off of me!

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Get off of me!

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Yeah, that's a good question.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Where is everyone else?

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
The whole town's just...

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Joel's the guy that killed them all.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I'm fine now, by the way.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yeah.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Yep, I'm good.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Thank you for that penicillin injection into my stomach.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
It really helped my heart.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Even though I just killed this entire town, we're not gonna loot it or anything.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
We're not gonna take a vehicle or any of their food.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
We're just gonna go.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Their food, their weapons, their fuel.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Or use some shelter to rest after all this, you know, stuff.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
I'll be too big for her.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I don't think we would like to take their food.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
I think there's a deer and a dead horse there.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Yeah, we can use that.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
The deer's used up, but the horse is good.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Oh.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Wait.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
That ended real quick.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
That was an hour, Dev.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.000
That's a long time, you little shite.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Yeah, but this time something actually happens.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I know.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
So it went faster because it was kind of fun.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
There was violence.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
There was murdering.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
There was a bit of creepy stuff.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000
A girl almost got raped.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
I just noticed something.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Didn't like that part.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I just noticed something.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
So the credits said Troy Baker.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
This guy is Troy Baker, I think.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.000
His right-handed man throughout the episode.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:15.000
And Troy Baker is actually a bit of a nod to the fans because he was the voice actor for Joel.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Damn.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:24.000
They apparently grabbed a bunch of the voice actors from the game and just gave them small roles scattered throughout the season.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:32.000
So instead of doing what the Dead Space remake did, where they made the main characters actually just take on the roles of the people,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:38.000
they replaced them with more prominent actors and had them play second fiddle in their own series.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Yes.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Damn.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000
A bit of an F.U.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
A bit of an F.U.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
I mean, it was nice of them to include them at all, but yes.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
At least they included them, but like as a side character.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000
It's a middle finger with a little bit of, you know, a little bit of goodness on it, too.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Yeah.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000
A little bit of good.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000
A little bit of bitter.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:07.000
So this episode was very much like the part of the game that it was covering.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
The characters were pretty much spot on.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
The locations were pretty much spot on.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.000
The fact that the town is now suddenly empty and no one else came to help is a bit strange, but fine.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000
We'll just accept it.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
The only issue is that it felt a little bit rushed.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:35.000
And that's a really damning thing to say, considering how in other episodes that we've talked about before, they just take their sweet fucking time doing nothing.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Yep.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
This is not a show that could afford to waste two episodes worth of time.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I completely agree.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Like, the Kansas City, the queues, there weren't fireflies, there were other rebels that overthrew the Federer in Kansas City.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
That needed a full extra episode to cook.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
And this one probably also needed a full extra episode to cook.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
And instead we got those flashback episodes.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:08.000
So I do think that the show could have been better if it didn't shoot itself in the foot in that way.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
That's my take on it, though.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Because this was actually more fun, and I wish it was longer.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
And I wish they had more build up.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:19.000
With the characters and the whole reveal of them being cannibals.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
It was way too on the nose about the cannibal part.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Yep.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:23.000
More subtlety.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
They could definitely learn that lesson.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:28.000
Let's talk about this food we're having, huh?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000
Guys, these big red plops of meat, that's bringing attention to it.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Like, probably not pointing towards the thing.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Yeah, in shows, there's often the trope where it's like, what's the meat?

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
And then it looks over and it's just very raw, very red meat.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.000
And the characters just wait for an extra second longer than they should.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
And it's like, okay, we get it.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
That's human.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
That's human meat.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
For whatever reason, they never cook it, too, so it looks very gross.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Yeah.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
It's very on the nose.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Or in this case, the ear.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
We've got one episode left, I think.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Hold on, let's get it done.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Let's get it over with.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Well, not today.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
It's next week, man.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000
It's next week.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Go find it.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Yeah, go steal it.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Well, the issue is, they now have to survive the winter.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
There's an extra sequence.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.000
They survive the winter, and then they get to Salt Lake City.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
And then there's a whole fucking shit show at Salt Lake City.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Then they have to go back to Tommy's town.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
So, I'm not sure if they can fit all of it in one episode.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
They gotta do that in one episode.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Yeah.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000
They gotta cram it because of all this crappy filler, or it's just gonna skim like 90% of

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
the stuff.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Yeah, there's like a big thing with the fireflies in Salt Lake City, and then they go back.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I feel like the pacing of the show is gonna be its downfall.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
They spent too much time on other shit that didn't matter.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Any of you three have final thoughts?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I would have eaten the horse.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000
This episode was more violent, and I liked that part.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
That's about it.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000
I think the destroying the pedal rapist was very empowering.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:14.000
It was very good watching Ellie just stab him for a full minute where that's all there

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
was.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000
It would be nice to see the corpse, but...

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Yeah.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Hold on, Jesus.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Bloodthirsty Lilith over here.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
No, no, no.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Lilith is right, actually.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
This show has already shown that it's violent and grotesque, right?

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:34.000
So why not actually make up a prop doll dummy of that actor, and then have her go to town

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
on it and show it?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
That'd be kinda fun.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Walking Dead Season 2, the game, the second one, they did that with the villain that got

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
beaten to death.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
They actually showed the corpse, but it was a video game.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
It's been so long since I played it.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
It's been at least five or six years.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
I recall that, though.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Yeah, I recall.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Well, in the end, you're like, Kenny gets to beat the villain to death, and you're given

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
a choice of watching or not.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Right, yes.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Yeah.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
So, two more episodes down.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
We're coming across the end.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000
We'll reunite one final time next week to watch the finale, unless my math is wrong.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I don't know why they have a nine-episode season.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
It's very strange, but I guess that's what they're doing.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
And then, I guess after that, what are we doing?

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Are we watching the Halo show, Kibs?

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Halo Season 2?

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Yes.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I've said yes on behalf of Kibs.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Kibs will rewatch the Halo show.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
What's my revenge after that?

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Because this is my revenge.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
You already owe me Dota.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Consider this the Dota.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
He's like, I will wash away the debt with your tears.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.000
I will sacrifice Dota for you watching the entirety of Halo.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
You know, there is no limit to bad shows nowadays.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Like, you want to go watch Velma?

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
You want to go watch the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air remake?

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I watched it.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
That was just sad.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
I remember Arch lamenting about it every episode he'd watch.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Oh, we can go watch Season 2 of Rings of Power.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
That'll be coming out, like, the end of the year.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Oh, yay, Deb.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I'm glad of all these stellar recommendations.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Like, honestly, this is not a good trend.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
We need to cover some good shows once in a while.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000
Otherwise, we're going to get stuck in the loop when the pendulum swing happens

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
and good TV starts coming out.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
We're going to be in the dust.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
This was the good show.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
This was the good show, yeah.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
All right, come here, you little shit.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
So we'll see you guys next week.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Say goodbye, everyone.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
Goodbye.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Take care.
