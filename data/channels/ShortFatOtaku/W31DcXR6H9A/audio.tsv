0	21000	Welcome back, everyone. We're doing another, um, another doubleheader tonight because real life seems to get in the way of everything all the time. All of our jobs and all of our, all of our commitments and all of Kib's streams. We just, we just can't seem to get it together, but we're here.
21000	23000	Wow, he name dropped me.
23000	25000	Well, he's singling me out.
25000	27000	All of us, Kibs!
27000	31000	All of us, all of us, but you more than the rest.
31000	37000	You deserve it. You can always move your streams. Your streams are flexible. I can now move my shit.
37000	38000	That's right.
38000	39000	This is your fault.
39000	42000	Arch and Lilith, you both work outside of the house.
42000	43000	Yep.
43000	48000	Unlike a lot of people, I have a job.
48000	49000	Yeah, my job is streaming.
49000	59000	So we are here watching The Last of Us episodes seven, which was last week's episodes that we missed and eight, which is today's episode. So at least something's going to be new.
59000	73000	Real quick before we start, since it's been two weeks, the last episode that we watched was the point where the show seemed to start to go downhill for me quite a bit because they ruined that very important Ellie Joel scene by undercutting all of its emotional impact.
73000	80000	By having that Joel Tommy scene in the workshop where Joel talks about having panic attacks, which was not in the game that was added.
80000	87000	You all might not be too surprised with this, but the Internet doesn't agree with me. The Internet loved that episode.
87000	94000	In fact, there's a bunch of articles floating around like this one on, let's say, more progressive leaning media sites.
94000	96000	This one is titled The Last of Us.
96000	101000	Joel exemplifies the strength of non-toxic masculinity.
101000	106000	Now, this is a long, boring article, as a lot of these articles tend to be.
106000	117000	The point basically is, is that because Joel had that moment of weakness where he talks honestly about his inability to care for Ellie and how how he's weak and it bothers him.
117000	121000	He is an example of non-toxic masculinity.
121000	126000	So can any of you point out the issue with with this line of logic?
126000	130000	Well, it's simple. Masculinity is being strong and capable.
130000	135000	Non-toxic masculinity is being weak and having fucking heart attacks because...
135000	136000	That's part of the problem.
136000	145000	If you look at, let's say, characters that are traditionally masculine, that progressives would call toxic masculine, like toxically masculine, they have toxic masculinity.
145000	147000	We can even stay within the realm of pop culture.
147000	153000	You can look at Superman, you can look at, let's say, Jean-Luc Picard, you can look at Han Solo, let's say.
153000	161000	These are all toxically masculine characters because they're too strong, they're too sure of themselves, forge the path forward and they disregard others' opinions sometimes.
161000	164000	Han Solo especially is a womanizer.
164000	168000	So there you go, they're objectifying women and they're not, they're toxically masculine.
168000	179000	OK, the issue ultimately is that Joel admits in the show to being a murderer and not just, you know, you kill someone in self-defense because you had to or you're facing off against an evil enemy.
179000	185000	No, he admits in the show, he jumped innocent people to take their stuff to survive.
185000	194000	Now, as far as I understand, the heroes of old, of the previous generation that exemplify toxic masculinity, they didn't do that.
194000	198000	Like, Han Solo was the thief with the heart of gold, right?
198000	204000	Like, he didn't just kill people for no reason or for like very self-serving reasons.
204000	205000	Joel did.
205000	217000	It's very strange because these people, they're putting forward this narrative that you can actually be the worst type of person, but as long as you cry about it later, then you're not toxic.
217000	218000	Yep.
218000	221000	It's the whole like, oh, I feel bad.
221000	225000	You know, I maybe was a murdering psychopath, but I felt bad about it.
225000	230000	So I'm, you know, a good guy now.
230000	232000	It's, oh, fuck.
232000	237000	As the old saying goes, it's a feeling that counts, okay?
237000	240000	Is that the old saying?
240000	242000	So that's what happened in the last episode.
242000	244000	This is how the internet took it.
244000	246000	Apparently leftoids loved that episode.
246000	248000	I thought it was absolute dog shit.
248000	250000	But it's time for us to watch the next one.
250000	253000	I just switch over here again, if you don't mind.
253000	254000	I do mind actually.
254000	256000	Oh, sorry.
256000	259000	Why did you even ask?
263000	268000	This is just a normal American suburb right now.
268000	270000	Even the house.
270000	272000	Leave.
272000	273000	Leave.
273000	274000	Shut up, Joel.
274000	275000	Take the gun.
275000	276000	Joel, shut the fuck up!
276000	278000	The Mandalorian started up, right?
278000	280000	Yep.
280000	284000	I guess Pedro Pascal just likes taking care of orphans now.
284000	286000	That's what he does.
286000	289000	I don't remember the last part of The Last of Us that well.
289000	293000	So did she actually just leave them in the game?
293000	298000	No, in the game, they just stayed there for like three months and healed them up.
298000	301000	And she just scavenged to get them alive.
301000	305000	So she might not necessarily have just outright left, just started leaving.
310000	314000	I wasn't the fastest. I wasn't the smartest.
314000	316000	Fight about it?
316000	318000	Don't fight.
319000	321000	She's not here anymore.
321000	322000	Is she?
322000	324000	The hipster effect.
327000	331000	I'm sure her shitty pace will pick up by standing there for a few minutes.
331000	334000	Oh, are they doing the DLC in this episode?
334000	336000	Yep, I think so.
336000	339000	My name's Kwon.
339000	342000	Oh my god, it reminds me of the Halo TV show.
342000	344000	Stop, Kwon.
344000	347000	I care because no matter what anyone out there says or thinks,
347000	350000	we're the only thing holding this all together.
350000	355000	If we go down, the people in this zone will starve or murder each other that much I know.
356000	359000	Considering what we've seen, that seems to be the truth.
359000	360000	He's right.
360000	363000	For all the evil that Fedra is.
363000	367000	I too believe the fascist oppressor is our best hope.
368000	370000	That's what they're implying.
371000	375000	Which way, Western woman-girl-thing child?
375000	379000	Don't do it, Ellie. Don't give in to the fascism.
379000	380000	She did.
380000	381000	She's a freak.
381000	383000	Captain Wong is being so nice.
383000	384000	Is that it?
384000	386000	That's it.
388000	389000	Sam Ting Wong?
389000	391000	Can I have my Walkman back?
391000	395000	You know, I should be offended by that, but I'm not. It was funny.
400000	411000	Now, this is fiction right here, because I've been told repeatedly there were no black comic characters ever.
411000	413000	Ha ha ha ha!
413000	415000	Uh oh.
417000	419000	Boogaloo.
421000	423000	Boogaloo boogaloo.
423000	426000	It's a flashback. It's her girlfriend.
430000	431000	Whoa.
443000	444000	Yes, she was black.
444000	448000	And you said ooga booga when she was coming in through the fucking window.
448000	449000	Damn.
449000	451000	You racist.
452000	453000	Oh my goodness.
453000	455000	I can't believe you did that.
458000	460000	Nope, that's staying.
463000	465000	Could you add in some jungle drums as well?
472000	474000	Keep it quiet, Harry.
475000	476000	Remember now.
481000	483000	This better be good.
495000	497000	And there they are. There's the guards.
497000	500000	Oh yeah, immediately perfectly correct.
510000	513000	Arch, how did you know that this was a lesbian romance situation?
515000	517000	Because you told me about it before.
517000	518000	Yeah, you told him, literally.
518000	521000	Oh shit, did I spoil this? Did I spoil the DLC?
521000	522000	You did.
522000	523000	Oh fuck.
523000	526000	Like, this has been common knowledge for a while now.
527000	529000	You spoil the entire story to him.
529000	530000	Oh shit, sorry Arch.
534000	536000	Wait, Canadians are always sorry. That's the point.
536000	539000	Sorry doesn't mean anything to a Canadian.
539000	541000	It's basically like, go fuck yourself.
546000	551000	Personally, I'm quite fond of lesbians, but I prefer if they were hot and adults.
551000	554000	And not fucking children. I was going to say not fucking children.
557000	559000	This is weird in the game, too.
559000	562000	Yeah, they're ages in the game where I think 14 and 17.
563000	566000	This is just my racism speaking here, but I fucking hate dreads.
566000	568000	Like, they just look bad. I don't like them.
569000	570000	I object.
570000	571000	You object to dreads?
571000	572000	How many floors?
572000	573000	I do.
573000	574000	You know what?
574000	577000	I think they can be done right.
577000	579000	Lots of people do them in a good way.
579000	582000	I've never banged a girl with dreads before.
583000	584000	Oh, yeah.
584000	586000	Oh, thanks, Steph. Thanks for letting her bitch.
586000	587000	Hold on, hold on.
587000	590000	I've never banged a girl with dreads before, and I want to at least once.
590000	592000	Before I completely rule it out.
595000	600000	There's probably not as much black people in Canada, though.
600000	602000	No, there's not. No.
603000	604000	It's a Bombay.
606000	609000	But that kind of dreads, where you have like a dread ponytail?
609000	612000	I just expect there to be something living inside of it.
617000	620000	You can keep dreads clean, like, and most people do.
621000	623000	They're not doing that in the post-apocalypse, though.
624000	625000	Oh, no!
628000	630000	I don't think floors break that way.
631000	632000	No.
632000	633000	They don't.
633000	636000	That would have to be cut and set up like that.
639000	640000	Dead guy fell on the ground.
640000	642000	Are we endearing?
642000	646000	I guess we're going to drink his old, gross booze.
648000	649000	Lauren's urine.
649000	650000	Depends.
650000	652000	And not even wonder what the fuck it is.
652000	653000	Yeah, like, Jesus.
653000	655000	You know, despite all of our tripping.
655000	658000	What if he had cordyceps and...
658000	659000	Oh.
659000	662000	He had cordyceps and now they're infected from drinking.
662000	663000	I know. I mean, I know.
663000	664000	Oh, no.
664000	665000	No, it's fine.
665000	667000	I'm not sure that's how transmission works.
667000	668000	No.
669000	671000	I don't need to understand science.
671000	672000	This show clearly doesn't.
672000	673000	Can I hold your gun?
673000	674000	That's true.
674000	678000	Like, that is literally a point I can't even fight you on.
680000	682000	You know, despite all of our tripping.
682000	685000	There have been, like, a few cute moments of, like, you know,
685000	688000	they're kids and they're growing up and life sucks.
688000	692000	I mean, this has been cringe, but still, like, okay so far.
692000	693000	Yeah.
693000	694000	This is pretty wholesome.
694000	699000	Also, I think I'm just less offended by teenage lesbians than art
699000	701000	because I've watched a shit ton of anime.
701000	703000	And they're always teenage lesbians in that.
709000	710000	Kibs.
710000	712000	Of age in Canada is 16.
712000	713000	Yeah, okay.
713000	715000	I mean, if that's the legal age, then you're fine.
715000	716000	That's how it is.
716000	719000	She's trying to make sure there's no lawbreakers here, okay?
719000	721000	Not Losh.
722000	724000	Welcome to Canada.
732000	736000	How does this chick know what a fascist dickbag is?
736000	739000	She's been living in Fedra for most of her life.
739000	741000	They're not going to educate you on that.
741000	743000	Especially if they actually are them.
743000	747000	I mean, they probably have, like, dictionaries
747000	750000	and they probably do teach to some degree.
750000	752000	History, maybe?
752000	756000	I don't imagine Fedra's education would be too different
756000	759000	than American education.
759000	762000	Like, maybe it's more extreme and more patriotic
762000	764000	and more authoritarian.
764000	768000	But, like, I think they would still teach basic concepts.
768000	769000	Maybe.
769000	772000	I would imagine it is because fascist in this world
772000	776000	means exactly the same as it means in this world of ours.
776000	777000	Asshole.
777000	778000	Asshole.
778000	780000	That's what I have a mild disagreement with.
782000	785000	You like, you know, cheese on your sandwich?
785000	786000	Well, it's not provable.
786000	787000	Fascist.
787000	788000	Fascist.
788000	789000	Ugh, fuck.
789000	790000	Let me put it like this.
790000	792000	If you ask dread girls, define fascism,
792000	793000	I doubt you'd get an answer.
793000	794000	She'd be like,
794000	798000	people that tell me what to do, fascist?
800000	803000	So it's the Twitter version of fascism, then?
805000	806000	Probably.
806000	808000	Most writers don't do research.
808000	810000	Sadly, in the modern era.
811000	813000	Fascist dickbags!
814000	816000	She only has one line.
828000	831000	I like how they're both fighting the shittiness
831000	834000	of the other's ideology, even though they both suck.
837000	838000	Well, they're both screwed.
838000	840000	It's like, oh, they're starving their population.
840000	842000	You mean rationing?
843000	846000	Does it look like it's easy to get food in the universe?
854000	857000	That's a dumb question the seal could have broken.
859000	861000	And that's not...
861000	863000	That is a hole in the roof.
863000	866000	Like, that is very clearly not a standard entrance.
866000	869000	Like, if they had known about it, maybe they had sealed it off.
871000	873000	I discovered a secret entrance, so it's not sealed.
873000	875000	Ha ha! Fascist.
875000	878000	Clearly the Fedra people were, you know,
878000	880000	just keeping it to themselves,
880000	883000	because they would waste all this precious space.
883000	886000	So, it turns out when Fedra connected that block up to the grid,
886000	888000	this place got connected, too.
888000	890000	Not that they know.
892000	894000	Oh, yeah. I mean, the entire mall
894000	896000	can almost control that much energy.
896000	898000	Pay attention.
898000	900000	We're gonna go through there, then turn right.
900000	902000	I'm sure there are dozens of kilowatts.
902000	904000	We don't know where we're going.
904000	906000	Fucking turn right, open the door,
906000	908000	tell me when you're there.
908000	912000	So, this area is pretty much exactly how it was in the game.
912000	914000	When they broke into the mall,
914000	917000	it was the same hole in the ceiling in the same corner with the same stuff.
917000	919000	Like, they remade the set.
919000	922000	I will say that this show has been consistently good in doing that.
922000	924000	Like, remaking locations exactly.
924000	926000	That is nice.
926000	929000	If you're a soulless console peasant and you play this game, poor that is.
931000	933000	Go play the PC version, Arch.
934000	936000	Yeah, you seem to be fine with that, you console scrub.
938000	940000	Arch plays console games, by the way.
940000	942000	Oh.
942000	946000	Ah, yes, that's not gonna alert anybody when the fucking mall lights up.
946000	948000	Yeah, the fucking windows.
948000	951000	This will definitely be difficult to see from the outside.
951000	954000	Yeah, I don't think these people know how malls work.
954000	959000	The guy at the federal power plant just sees the power usage spike.
959000	961000	He's like, what the fuck?
961000	963000	What the fuck?
965000	967000	No way.
967000	969000	Playing copyrighted music.
970000	972000	I love this song.
976000	978000	Of course you do. It's made by Norwegian.
981000	984000	When I was, like, very, very young, this was on the radio regularly,
984000	986000	and now I'm like, oh my god, I'm so old.
992000	993000	You know...
993000	996000	Yeah, trust me, you do not want to end up like that Chinese guy that got stuck in the escalator.
996000	1001000	Yeah, like, escalators are very dangerous, and this is the one that has been used in 20 years.
1002000	1004000	Yep. One of them gets caught, sucked in.
1005000	1010000	It's fine, Ellie is doing the thing that her face is getting blended up.
1012000	1013000	It's like, fuck, fuck.
1013000	1015000	If you guys remember the video.
1015000	1017000	What video was that?
1017000	1022000	Oh, it was just, like, a woman, like, after exiting an escalator, that metal plate gives out,
1022000	1024000	and she basically got blended.
1025000	1026000	Oh, fuck, yeah.
1026000	1028000	And there was a kid that happened to have a kid, too.
1028000	1029000	Yeah.
1029000	1031000	Oh my god.
1031000	1033000	Is this the Edmonton Mall?
1036000	1038000	I know they shot this in Canada.
1047000	1049000	No, no, they got an abandoned mall instead.
1050000	1053000	No, the Edmonton Mall is, um, the biggest mall in Canada.
1054000	1056000	It's fucking huge.
1057000	1059000	And it's a pretty well-known Canadian spot.
1061000	1062000	I swear to god, show.
1062000	1068000	If you show me Elliot Page in underwear in this fucking episode, I am going to scream.
1069000	1073000	You're, like, three connections removed from Elliot Page right now, Arch.
1074000	1075000	I just noticed.
1075000	1077000	Her eyebrows all fucked up.
1077000	1078000	That's annoying me.
1078000	1080000	It's been like that the entire show?
1080000	1083000	Yeah, but I've just noticed, and I really don't like it now.
1083000	1085000	But that's literally Elliot's design.
1085000	1087000	They even pointed it out twice?
1087000	1091000	Yeah, she mentioned that there was some kind of fight at a 7-Eleven.
1091000	1097000	I mean, I wonder what the guy in that generator room, like, at the federal power plant's like, what the fuck?
1097000	1100000	You know this place is, like, eating up so much power.
1100000	1102000	Yeah, like, all the stores are turned on and shit.
1102000	1104000	This is a pretty cheap ride.
1104000	1106000	The horses don't even go up and down.
1107000	1109000	You know what's funny about this?
1109000	1113000	This is another procrastinating episode where we don't get to see any cool stuff happen.
1113000	1118000	It's been 26 minutes and absolutely nothing of relevance or interest has happened.
1118000	1119000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm kind of bored.
1119000	1123000	I think this is going to be another, um, another episode.
1123000	1125000	You lost to some clickers getting their heads smashed.
1125000	1127000	Yeah, I want to see, like, Zambies and stuff.
1128000	1132000	This is going to be another episode like the, uh, the gay libertarian romance episode
1132000	1135000	where we just stop for a minute and see flashbacks.
1136000	1139000	Like, this season doesn't have that many fucking episodes.
1139000	1141000	We already wasted one doing that.
1142000	1144000	Now we're doing it again.
1144000	1152000	Well, so, to their credit, this is pretty much how it went in the game's DLC for Ellie's backstory.
1153000	1155000	They went into the mall, they dicked around.
1155000	1161000	Now, there were enemies in the mall that they fought, but, like, the actual idea of it
1161000	1168000	being an extended date for two young women who don't know what their sexuality is.
1168000	1170000	It's the same story.
1170000	1174000	I turned 17 next month. That's when you get your assignment.
1174000	1176000	You know what Kwon gave me?
1179000	1181000	Sewage detail.
1182000	1186000	And I'm a proud woman, goddammit. I don't do sewage work. That's for men.
1189000	1191000	Actually, you know what it is? It's the black Asian...
1191000	1192000	Watch as somebody has to do it.
1192000	1197000	It's the black Asian racist, uh, war that's going to be happening in the future.
1197000	1198000	It's already happening right now.
1198000	1200000	No, don't make me touch the boobie.
1201000	1208000	I do like this. So she didn't run away for ideological reasons or because they were fascist dickbags, but because she was asked to do a dirty job.
1208000	1209000	Alright.
1209000	1211000	I mean, someone has to do it.
1211000	1213000	Understandable motivation.
1213000	1219000	What do you mean, shovel of shit? That's... debasing. Disgraceful. More important than that.
1220000	1226000	I mean, if this society's anything like real world, you get paid very well. And compensated well for doing a dirty job.
1226000	1233000	That's the thing, Kibbs. It's not like the real world. You don't get compensated well. You get compensated with you do it or you get shot.
1233000	1235000	You know what? What you want to do...
1235000	1238000	I like that. That's a win. You don't get shot.
1238000	1241000	You got to look at the bright side of it. You can't be such a pessimist.
1241000	1247000	In a liberal capitalist society, these jobs get done because you get paid for them.
1247000	1250000	And if there's no one who wants to do them, then you have to offer more money.
1250000	1253000	And the market kind of balances itself in a sense.
1254000	1259000	In an actual fascist society, they'll just point the guns at you and say, this is your work detail.
1259000	1261000	But then again, so will a communist one, so...
1261000	1263000	Same thing in the end.
1263000	1265000	I mean, they are the same, yeah.
1269000	1272000	God, I hope the zombies eat them both alive.
1272000	1273000	Patience.
1273000	1275000	Are you cringing, Arch?
1277000	1280000	What's wrong, Arch? You don't like this?
1281000	1283000	There we go.
1283000	1285000	Oh, fuck.
1286000	1288000	Yeah, the ink's kind of old, dude.
1294000	1297000	My dollar seems like a lot, though.
1298000	1299000	Pretty stiff.
1299000	1302000	Even for 2003, it was a lot, I think.
1305000	1308000	It was like a dollar back then, I think.
1311000	1312000	Awesome.
1313000	1314000	Yeah.
1315000	1317000	This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
1319000	1322000	Listen, the episode has redeemed itself.
1323000	1326000	Because arcades were so much fun back in the day.
1328000	1331000	You can still find arcades today.
1331000	1335000	Man, I recall going to a hotel in like 2015 or something.
1335000	1342000	And they had like some sort of atrium entertainment area, like down in the lobby.
1342000	1346000	And there was like a path where you could see the pool, like the hotel's pool.
1346000	1347000	So okay, there's a pool.
1347000	1349000	There was like a pool table.
1349000	1353000	Okay, you could play a game of pool for a dollar or something.
1353000	1358000	And then there was like two neglected arcade cabinets in the corner.
1358000	1361000	And one of them was broken.
1361000	1366000	And the other one was Ms. Pac-Man from a very long time ago.
1366000	1369000	And I was like, Jesus, no one's played this in years, have they?
1369000	1371000	Her pays are pretty cool.
1371000	1373000	There's still some around, though.
1374000	1376000	Not in Canada. Rip.
1376000	1380000	I think there's a place in Minnesota like Dave and Busters is what it's called.
1380000	1382000	popcorn from 52 years ago.
1385000	1387000	Mortal Kombat!
1391000	1393000	My dinner's ruined.
1396000	1399000	So Naomi, she's also watching this series, too.
1399000	1402000	And she gave me this insight.
1404000	1413000	Her theory as to why they changed the dates of the show to make it so that the apocalypse happened in 2003
1413000	1422000	and that this is now 2023 is that it made it much easier to get era-appropriate props
1422000	1428000	because everything that they would get that was era-appropriate would automatically be aged 20 years
1428000	1431000	because it is aged 20 years.
1431000	1437000	So this Mortal Kombat 2 cabinet looks old because it probably is one of the originals.
1437000	1439000	They didn't have to recreate it, you know?
1443000	1445000	I'm bored.
1447000	1449000	Kibs, listen.
1449000	1452000	The only reason you're bored right now is because you're too young to enjoy Mortal Kombat.
1452000	1454000	I said, damn, he got bored.
1454000	1457000	Oh, I thought you said you're bored. Oh, sorry.
1457000	1462000	I'm going to have to tell Vee that has this in the show. He'll be happy.
1463000	1465000	With my fetish.
1467000	1470000	I forgot that that was Vee's fetish.
1470000	1472000	Wait, what?
1472000	1474000	The old Vee lore.
1474000	1476000	This is a Vee lore item. Oh, I'm not familiar with it.
1476000	1478000	Vee lore and vore.
1478000	1480000	He likes vore.
1480000	1482000	Really?
1482000	1484000	Yeah.
1484000	1486000	Eat up.
1486000	1488000	He had a fur sauna and everything at one point because it wasn't just wool.
1488000	1490000	Oh, he still does.
1490000	1492000	Uh oh, a clicker.
1492000	1494000	Always a clicker. You're not going to show up?
1494000	1496000	Is it time?
1497000	1500000	Ooh, they're using the dollhouse for it. That's a pretty good one.
1500000	1502000	Very spooky.
1502000	1504000	There he is.
1504000	1506000	Now, remember how long that person has to have been here?
1508000	1510000	Yeah.
1510000	1512000	To become a full mushroom.
1512000	1514000	So that means somebody actually waddled in here.
1514000	1516000	Yep.
1516000	1520000	Man, I think what I would miss most in the post-apocalypse is the video games.
1520000	1522000	I just love them too much.
1522000	1528000	I mean, as long as you have electricity, you can still play, like, physical media games.
1528000	1530000	Yeah.
1530000	1532000	On consoles and shit.
1532000	1534000	That's right.
1534000	1536000	Arch, consoles would rule the day in the post-apocalypse.
1536000	1540000	Luckily, the war with China won't lead to the apocalypse.
1542000	1544000	It'll just lead to free and cheap labor.
1552000	1554000	That person just fucked up.
1554000	1558000	Well, no, it's supposed to be volume 2 with a T.O.O.
1558000	1560000	It's a pun book.
1560000	1562000	All right, Dev, you're getting beaten too.
1562000	1566000	Listen, my pun sense immediately fluted in.
1566000	1570000	That's kind of terrible, Dev. I kind of hate you now.
1570000	1574000	Isn't the clicker fucking moving faster?
1574000	1576000	What's wrong, Arch? Are you bored?
1576000	1578000	It's so loud.
1578000	1580000	It takes screenshots.
1580000	1582000	Some of you have been out of Arch's pain.
1582000	1584000	Not much, though.
1584000	1586000	Watch those screenshots.
1586000	1594000	See, there's wholesome aspects to this, and there's cringe aspects to this, and they're kind of overlapping.
1594000	1598000	I'm kind of enjoying it, but it's also kind of boring, yeah?
1600000	1602000	Oh, shit.
1602000	1604000	The pipe bombs.
1606000	1608000	Don't just...
1608000	1612000	It's just like, I don't mind a romance story, I guess.
1612000	1616000	The villain fucking Ted thing was like, okay, I mean, decently done.
1616000	1622000	But this is just two kids on a date? I'm not interested.
1622000	1626000	Arch, were you never a kid on a date before?
1626000	1630000	I have experienced this. I don't need to see it on television.
1630000	1632000	Okay, you could make this interesting.
1632000	1642000	Like, if you had two really interesting characters doing this stuff, you had a long relationship with both of them, and they had been flirting or whatever, this was the culmination, sure.
1642000	1648000	But it isn't. I don't know who rat hair is. I barely know who Ellie is at this point.
1648000	1654000	I think they have too many flashbacks. They're really relying on you knowing the game.
1654000	1658000	Yes, and I don't. I don't care.
1662000	1666000	I mean, she's right about that. Ha, got him.
1668000	1674000	You join the communist revolutionaries and they're already ordering you around and making you go places.
1674000	1676000	I need to fight for the revolution in some country or some city.
1676000	1678000	At least it's not Fedra who orders you to do things.
1678000	1682000	You know, like, logistics and maintain the city.
1682000	1690000	I like how she complains so much about being told to shovel shit, and now she's like, well, I'm told to go to Atlanta, I guess I'll just do it. It's like, okay.
1690000	1694000	Oh no, now she's going to feel so bad when she's eaten by a zombie.
1710000	1712000	Spirit Halloween!
1712000	1716000	That fucking zombie's taking a sweet ass time.
1716000	1720000	Listen, Arch, he's been stuck there for a while. His legs are a little stiff.
1720000	1724000	He's going to work up that, you know, limber up a little.
1724000	1728000	Arch, can't wait to see a black person die.
1728000	1730000	I mean, it's true.
1730000	1732000	Arch can't keep his hatred of them.
1732000	1736000	I want to see the white person die too.
1736000	1744000	It's going to be that scene from American History X, but the guy kicking the black man is going to be a zombie with a mushroom head.
1747000	1751000	Listen, I read Marx, okay? I get it. Power to the people or whatever.
1751000	1754000	I watched RedTube, I know what's going on.
1760000	1762000	Damn, they groomed her.
1762000	1764000	That's what she just said.
1764000	1766000	Yeah, pretty much.
1768000	1770000	Yeah, his father.
1770000	1772000	They love-bombed me!
1776000	1780000	Damn. Arch, make more whining sounds about how bad this is.
1780000	1782000	Please.
1782000	1784000	I am busy right now.
1784000	1786000	I'm playing on my phone.
1786000	1790000	My shipgirl waifus need me more than this TV show does.
1790000	1793000	I knew you were fucking slacking.
1793000	1795000	Wait, what are you playing, Arch?
1795000	1797000	Azur Lane.
1797000	1799000	Fuck.
1800000	1809000	This reminds me of, like, some of those best of the worst episodes, I don't know, that are media, where Mike will look over and Rich will just be on his phone playing.
1809000	1811000	I was like, you fucking cheater!
1811000	1813000	You gotta watch this shit with us!
1814000	1816000	Oh, this is the scene.
1816000	1818000	I remember this because they're going to get-
1821000	1825000	Yeah, if it's like the game, they're going to-
1825000	1827000	Yep, there's the masks.
1827000	1829000	Okay, they're doing exactly like the game.
1829000	1834000	They get the masks, they run around with the masks, they get bit accidentally because they're being stupid with masks.
1834000	1836000	Because they're dumb kids.
1841000	1845000	Oh, sweet baby Jesus, this is actually going to be the entire fucking episode.
1845000	1847000	It is. This is the episode.
1848000	1851000	Listen, Ellie, we're almost of age.
1851000	1853000	We gotta learn how to dance on tables.
1855000	1857000	Okay.
1861000	1863000	Okay.
1865000	1867000	That was real easy to talk her out of it.
1868000	1871000	Okay, you can die now. You've had your kissy thingy.
1871000	1873000	Yep, here it comes.
1873000	1876000	Revolutionary Lesbians in Late-Stage Capitalism.
1877000	1879000	Oh, no.
1879000	1881000	Have you guys actually played that?
1882000	1884000	Let's not talk about that again.
1885000	1887000	Focus on the fun.
1889000	1891000	Damn, here's your shot.
1898000	1900000	Everyone was bit.
1900000	1902000	And we just don't realize it.
1902000	1903000	Of course.
1903000	1906000	Because the camera working intentionally didn't show anything.
1906000	1907000	Yep.
1907000	1911000	Oh, you know, 9mm bullets, not all that dangerous.
1911000	1913000	But a knife to the head, well...
1913000	1915000	Holy shit!
1916000	1918000	She's not happy though, because she's dead.
1921000	1924000	You're gonna have to put her down, Ellie.
1924000	1926000	Why are you smiling?
1932000	1934000	Chomp.
1937000	1939000	Yeah.
1949000	1954000	Just like with the whole Pablo Escobar, whatever his name was, getting stabbed.
1954000	1957000	That didn't happen. You didn't actually shoot that.
1958000	1962000	He didn't seem to get his mouth close enough to either of those body parts.
1962000	1965000	They didn't. They just pretended it happened.
1967000	1972000	Oh wow, now we'll get the shocking revelation that she didn't actually leave anyway.
1976000	1978000	Didn't you enjoy that flashback?
1979000	1983000	That was totally worth fucking 50 minutes of my existence.
1984000	1987000	She just stood there and remembered the whole story.
1987000	1991000	And Joel's like, I'm dying, just either help me or leave.
1992000	1995000	Hey, calm down Pablo, I'm reminiscing right here.
1995000	1998000	I remember being a lesbian because of a DLC they released.
1999000	2001000	Oh, by the way...
2004000	2012000	So, I mentioned before, revolutionary lesbians in late stage capitalism.
2012000	2016000	That's actually a game you can play. You can download that on Steam if you want.
2017000	2019000	No, I don't think I will.
2019000	2025000	It's not a very good game, I don't know if you can tell.
2028000	2031000	You know what, they just listened to the federal people. I think they both have lived.
2035000	2037000	I think that's the message of the story.
2037000	2040000	Or if they had swept the ball properly.
2040000	2043000	Moral of the story is, fascism saves lives.
2045000	2048000	That's like the Warhammer 40k moral.
2049000	2051000	Uh oh, that's a mmm.
2052000	2056000	If only you had listened to the Nazis keeping you safe, warm and fed.
2056000	2062000	The multi-racial, multi-cultural, LGBTQ plus approving Nazis.
2063000	2065000	They're very progressive, okay?
2068000	2070000	Nazism has come a long way.
2072000	2076000	I mean, if you could have Nick Fuentes in your ranks, you were gone for three hours.
2077000	2079000	What were you doing?
2084000	2088000	My mouse is getting a tiny bit dirty. I think I might have to go clean it or something.
2089000	2092000	You don't get to get out of this that easy, Blondie.
2094000	2098000	Well, Joe, I mean, it's not bleeding at all.
2098000	2101000	Actually, I don't think I need to stitch this.
2101000	2105000	Fine, I don't know what you're being a big baby about.
2107000	2110000	Unironically, this is nothing.
2110000	2113000	Yeah, there's no blood coming out.
2113000	2114000	That hurt.
2114000	2117000	Yeah, no, you're just adding mania.
2119000	2121000	Uh, that hurts.
2121000	2125000	Yeah, no, there's no blood. The wound is dry, like...
2126000	2130000	And you're sewing it with a needle you found in a fucking cupboard somewhere.
2130000	2132000	You're doing a horrible arselet.
2133000	2135000	There's probably cordyceps on it, fuck.
2139000	2140000	So...
2142000	2148000	So, how did you enjoy flashback episode number two, guys?
2149000	2152000	That's really easy to put into words, Dev.
2152000	2153000	Yeah?
2153000	2158000	I'll be right back. I'm getting a piece of cloth to fucking watch my mouse.
2159000	2162000	Far more important. And interesting.
2162000	2165000	I guess Arch doesn't have anything to say about it.
2165000	2169000	Well, to be fair, Arch didn't play the game.
2169000	2171000	So, it is a different situation.
2171000	2173000	I actually played the DLC.
2173000	2174000	So did I.
2175000	2177000	But did you like the DLC? Because I didn't.
2177000	2180000	It was okay. It wasn't as good as the main game.
2180000	2185000	I felt like it was like, oh, by the way, Elia's for sure trans, and that's the DLC.
2185000	2187000	Not trans, lesbian.
2187000	2189000	Or lesbian. Whatever.
2189000	2191000	Listen, names and stuff are hard, okay?
2191000	2194000	You know, it could be lesbian. They might retcon that later.
2194000	2196000	But either way, she's lesbian.
2196000	2197000	Yes.
2197000	2199000	My memory, I'm old man memory now.
2199000	2202000	But, like, I just remember the DLC being kind of like,
2202000	2205000	Ellie's a lesbian now. Wow, isn't that amazing?
2205000	2208000	And it's like, I'm playing the DLC and I was like,
2208000	2210000	yeah, but like, this is kind of boring.
2210000	2212000	Just like the DLC was.
2212000	2214000	Because the DLC was just kind of boring, too.
2214000	2216000	It didn't really add anything fun.
2216000	2219000	Yeah, I kind of agree. When it comes to the game,
2219000	2223000	the actual DLC itself wasn't, like,
2223000	2227000	the levels were just kind of samey and they didn't really do anything with them.
2227000	2229000	And you only play as Ellie. There's no Joel.
2229000	2231000	It's just Ellie because it's her flashback.
2231000	2236000	And I think, like, it was one of the first instances of,
2236000	2239000	let's see if woke stuff sells.
2239000	2243000	Let's sell a DLC where we're only selling the fact that
2243000	2245000	Ellie is going to be confirmed a lesbian.
2245000	2246000	And that's it.
2246000	2250000	And they didn't really, like, they didn't put anything else that was fun in it.
2251000	2255000	For me, when I played it, that was kind of all I got out of it.
2255000	2257000	I didn't really care at the time and I still don't.
2257000	2260000	It's like, OK, Ellie's a lesbian, but like,
2260000	2263000	at the end of the day, I want my money back because the experience of the DLC.
2263000	2268000	Like, to be blunt, like, the DLC added a bunch of rehashed, like,
2268000	2271000	like what felt like rehashed recycled assets
2271000	2275000	for a couple of levels that just really didn't add anything.
2275000	2276000	Yeah.
2276000	2279000	And it was like at that point, by the time I'd beaten the game The Last of Us,
2279000	2281000	I was already kind of bored of the gameplay loop.
2281000	2284000	It's like more of that just wasn't enough.
2284000	2288000	I personally have mixed feelings about this episode because it,
2288000	2290000	in my opinion, it wasn't very interesting.
2290000	2294000	It was a second and another flashback episode.
2294000	2299000	However, if you were a Last of Us purist,
2299000	2303000	a Last of Us mega fan, you know, and you wanted to...
2303000	2305000	You probably already don't like the show, though.
2305000	2308000	Well, if you're, no, no, if you're a purist,
2308000	2311000	you're going to want it to be exactly like the video game.
2311000	2313000	Yeah, you're going to want the mushrooms back and the, you know,
2313000	2314000	I agree with that. I agree with that.
2314000	2318000	But, but, but here's the thing.
2318000	2322000	This, this episode, for better or worse,
2322000	2325000	was like the DLC that it's based on.
2325000	2328000	And someone who really is invested in these characters
2328000	2332000	and these stories in these games would probably like this episode
2332000	2334000	just because of that. It's like, okay, no, this is the story.
2334000	2337000	It's properly adapted. Okay.
2337000	2340000	Now you can not like the story looking at it from a non-fan's point of view,
2340000	2342000	like Arches and fair enough.
2342000	2347000	But I think, I think you can't, you can't come at this one with like,
2347000	2349000	Oh my God, they changed it and made it worse.
2349000	2352000	You can't make that argument this time because it is accurate.
2352000	2354000	Well, yeah. I mean, the only thing,
2354000	2357000	the only thing I saw like major lore break in this one
2357000	2360000	was the fact that when the zombie was going after Ellie,
2360000	2363000	you could see the little tentacles come out of its mouth for a second,
2363000	2367000	which is not canon. But beyond that, like the biting,
2367000	2370000	like the whole sequence, that's pretty on point.
2370000	2372000	The issue is, is like, even if you're a purist,
2372000	2374000	I don't think purists will be watching at this point.
2374000	2377000	The purists would have already tuned out because it's,
2377000	2381000	it's not a pure, it's not a pure replica.
2381000	2384000	It's possible. How about you, Lilith? How'd you feel about this episode?
2384000	2388000	I haven't played the DLC, but like in the time I did watch it,
2388000	2393000	it was like a very long time ago. So like,
2393000	2398000	it's kind of about the story beats I remember and like, you know,
2398000	2402000	they wanted to adopt the DLC into the story and that's fine.
2402000	2410000	Like it gives the viewers who don't know the story or haven't played the game,
2410000	2413000	a bit of an insight into Ellie's backstory.
2413000	2418000	Like some people might think it's unnecessary and like,
2418000	2423000	it doesn't feel like extremely pertinent to the story so far,
2423000	2428000	at least from what we've seen, like next episode might change her mind.
2428000	2434000	Like her girlfriend might be important in shaping her character or something,
2434000	2438000	but like that remains to be seen.
2438000	2441000	Well, I guess we'll just have to watch on, but if not,
2441000	2446000	then like other people have said, like it's,
2446000	2451000	it would be pretty pointless for the most part or at least padding,
2451000	2453000	some might say.
2453000	2456000	Yep. Yeah, it definitely feels like padding.
2456000	2461000	And you know, if we count the other, the other flashback episode,
2461000	2465000	we've now had two episodes of padding out of seven episodes.
2465000	2467000	And isn't there only nine episodes in this season?
2467000	2472000	I mean, if they want to like self-contained like stories,
2472000	2475000	then just let that be an episode. I mean, that's fine.
2475000	2480000	Like I don't have anything against that, but like,
2480000	2484000	like you said, there's like not that much, that many episodes left.
2484000	2489000	I mean, they're taking a risk and you know what I'd rather they,
2489000	2494000	if they are going to get into it, I'd rather dedicate the time to do it.
2494000	2498000	Right. Then to not do it at all, if they're going to do it anyways.
2498000	2501000	So, yeah. And you know what, to this episode's credit,
2501000	2506000	it is more central to the story than,
2506000	2511000	than the Bill and Frank story because those characters don't come back again.
2511000	2515000	Yeah. And with this one, you could actually like,
2515000	2521000	it shows off how Ellie got bitten and found out that she's immune
2521000	2528000	and also goes a bit to her past, which is, you know, fine from a narrative perspective.
2528000	2533000	Yeah, definitely. I think that's definitely a valid point because this episode,
2533000	2536000	unlike the Bill and Fred one. Oh God, I already forgot the other guy.
2536000	2540000	It's Frank. It's Frank, you fucking homophobe, Kibbs.
2540000	2544000	Kibbs, how can you be a self-hating homophobe, man?
2544000	2547000	Wow. But this episode, yes.
2547000	2551000	This episode actually has far more plot relevance than Bill and Frank ever did.
2551000	2556000	Because Bill and Frank was a side story that had nothing to do with the main characters
2556000	2559000	and like they're dead and then they waddled away.
2559000	2564000	Yep. And then they immediately lose Bill's truck, like the next episode.
2564000	2567000	So it's like, oh, well, okay.
2567000	2570000	That was the whole episode for a plot device, for a truck,
2570000	2575000	for a thing that we're going to use for like the first five minutes of this episode.
2575000	2578000	And then just fucking gone.
2578000	2584000	Arch, did you actually want to give your take on this episode or?
2584000	2591000	I can, with great and everlasting eternal joy, inform you and everyone else that my mouse is now clean.
2591000	2593000	I see. Okay.
2593000	2595000	All right, we can move on to the next one.
2595000	2598000	So that was episode seven and now we have episode eight to talk about
2598000	2600000	or to watch and then talk about, I guess.
2600000	2606000	But first, real quick, I had this episode spoiled to me, the one that we just watched.
2606000	2609000	Sorry, I knew it was coming. I didn't reveal it.
2609000	2613000	I didn't want to break the magic of this amazing show for everyone.
2613000	2617000	But I knew that this was going to be the LEDLC lesbian romance.
2617000	2620000	And then they get bit at the end episode.
2620000	2625000	And the reason why I knew that is because of this article.
2625000	2639000	Basically, do you recall how Ben Shapiro and some of the other like rightoid political pundits talked about how they shoehorned in gay men into The Last of Us with Bill and Frank, even though they were already gay?
2639000	2650000	Right. Basically, the same type of complaint came out of, you know, rightoid YouTube channels about they they added more gay people to the last was how could they do this?
2650000	2653000	And it's like, you guys, these people were always gay.
2653000	2657000	And of course, that meant to, you know, more people on the left on Twitter making fun of them.
2657000	2662000	And, you know, you everyone knows how this sort of news cycle works on the Internet nowadays, right?
2662000	2666000	Someone gets outraged. The other side laughs and says they're ignorant.
2666000	2672000	And it's just it's just a constant echoing drama that just goes for forever.
2672000	2682000	All right. And so once it came out that people on the right were not happy with this episode and not because it was poorly written and poorly paced
2682000	2689000	and didn't really fit with the rest of the story and just wasn't you know, wasn't a very good episode all in all.
2689000	2705000	But because it was lesbians, the actress who played Ellie's girlfriend, I forget her name, Riley Storm Reid, she said she isn't concerned with homophobic The Last of Us fans because we are telling important stories.
2705000	2711000	It's 2023. If you're concerned about who I love, then I need you to get your priorities straight.
2711000	2714000	It's current year, guys.
2714000	2717000	I thought Stormy Reid was a porn actress.
2717000	2721000	Yeah, yeah. Me, too. Isn't that a porn name?
2721000	2727000	Yeah, it's like, I mean, it's fair if she's upset that people are upset about this.
2727000	2730000	Like, it is a pretty dumb thing to cry over.
2730000	2733000	The objection to this exists on TV.
2733000	2741000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly right. Like, you know, the objection to this to this episode isn't lesbians exist.
2741000	2748000	It is that it's a it's another flashback in a show that's already very slow and needs to have a bit more meat on the bone.
2748000	2752000	That's the objection. The lesbian part doesn't really matter that much.
2752000	2755000	I know that I know our you're like making fun of him a bit, but it really doesn't matter.
2755000	2761000	Like, but some people for we're just basically it's turned into another culture war thing.
2761000	2768000	The thing is, it's a bit of a derpy situation because there are a lot of I don't know if I'd call them right.
2768000	2776000	But there are people on YouTube who do entertainment commentary stuff for pop culture commentary along the lines of what I do.
2776000	2781000	But a lot of them do pretend that they know what they're talking about.
2781000	2786000	And so they go like, oh, they put they put gays in this because they realize that's a that's a talking point, right?
2786000	2791000	You don't like forced woke ism gays woke. Right. So therefore it's bad.
2791000	2795000	But if you actually did some research, you realize, you know, they were always gay.
2795000	2803000	There's been held the last of us. I don't bother covering this specifically on news about it because one, I don't know about it.
2803000	2807000	Two, I don't care about it. And three, as far as I'm concerned, it's a woke is property already.
2807000	2810000	So I'm like, oh, you know, woke thing.
2811000	2818000	But I see because that's the thing. I don't mind there being gays and TV show.
2818000	2825000	I applauded the the Bill and Ted romance with the caveat, so long as it didn't screw over the rest of the show, which in part it does.
2825000	2831000	And now there's a second filler episode and I'm kind of just sitting here like, wow, this is getting very boring.
2831000	2834000	That's my contention with it. But yes, a lot of people do.
2835000	2841000	They try to jump on the bandwagon that frankly passed a year or two ago.
2841000	2852000	Yeah, yeah, I think so. Like, no, no offense to guys like the quartering, but his his whole thing seems to have hit its peak a little bit ago.
2852000	2860000	And now it's kind of like on its way down in terms of what's popular on YouTube, you know, and also just Jeremy say this.
2860000	2863000	Now, it sounds like I'm starting drama.
2863000	2866000	He had no idea. Wow.
2866000	2872000	Arch spoke the truth and arch versus Jeremy. I mean, this was bound to happen, though.
2872000	2877000	I have I have unironically seen this because because it is the thing, right?
2877000	2880000	Because the left did this to say they've always been woke.
2880000	2885000	That was always been woke. No, it hasn't. It's literally the same knee jerk reaction thing.
2885000	2890000	Was it the oh, God, there was a show a little while ago.
2890000	2898000	I can't there was one show or was it a game with everyone on like our side, quote unquote, said it was going to be awful.
2898000	2902000	And it turned out it was actually pretty OK. And everyone was kind of coping about it.
2902000	2907000	What was that? That sounds it does sound familiar. It wasn't Hogwarts.
2907000	2910000	It was before that. It was a game. I think it was a game.
2910000	2917000	I think it was a game. Yeah, it might have been a game because I remember everyone's like, oh, no, no movie, movie Avatar, The Way of Goddamn Water.
2917000	2921000	That was it. I didn't see that. Was it actually good?
2921000	2925000	I don't know. I'm Cindy there. But I remember that everyone's talking about like, yeah, this is going to bomb.
2925000	2930000	This is going to be awful. Like he's talking about toxic masculinity is going to be terrible.
2930000	2933000	And I didn't comment on it at all because I hadn't seen anything of it.
2933000	2938000	And if I don't know anything about a thing, I'll probably usually just be like, yeah, that doesn't sound good.
2938000	2943000	But there wasn't anything about toxic masculinity in the movie, though.
2943000	2952000	No, I don't think. Oh, yeah. But the director had said so specifically that he wanted to fight toxic masculinity and he didn't want guns and et cetera.
2952000	2958000	Fuck. Also, the the pregnant female Navi warrior.
2958000	2961000	But by and large, the movie turned out to be OK.
2961000	2968000	And it's like, OK, so that reminds me of like pregnant Spider-Man who's like swinging around on.
2968000	2974000	I was like, it looks ridiculous. Fuck.
2974000	2979000	But the way of water ended up being enormous economic success. So a lot of people were kind of coping about it.
2979000	2986000	And I get it. But like you do have to it is, again, that idea that we are on the defensive all the time.
2986000	2992000	If you're on the defensive, you have to try and cancel things. You have to protect yourself against those things by attacking them.
2992000	3000000	We're not there anymore. We are genuinely in a position where we can we can be offensive.
3000000	3005000	Yes. Yeah. Anyway, you know, we don't have to be on the defensive.
3005000	3011000	If way of water turns out to be good. Great. If Hogwarts turns out to be good. Fantastic.
3011000	3016000	If it turns out to be shit. Well, I'm bastard then, too. Yeah. Yeah, I completely agree.
3016000	3020000	I was on E-FAP yesterday when we were talking about Atomic Heart.
3020000	3030000	And I made the point that I really enjoyed the the over sexualized fridge girlfriend where she liked her.
3030000	3035000	I fucking I hated the fact that they moved away from her. Like occasionally you would just get generic voice.
3035000	3040000	I'm like, oh, fridge waifu. I know, Kibbs, you've played it a little.
3040000	3045000	Did you play it on the card? Yeah, I watched some gameplays of it. Yeah.
3045000	3050000	OK, so so there's there's the one fridge that you buy your items and stuff from or you upgrade your stuff at.
3050000	3055000	And it has the A.I. it's like a horny, super horny robot. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3055000	3059000	So people were saying that, like, it was problematic and it was sexist.
3059000	3067000	And I was just like, listen, I like this. Yeah, I like this, even though it was kind of over the top and cringe sometimes.
3067000	3071000	Because because it's. Yes. Yeah. But but here's the thing.
3071000	3080000	It's because it's something that a woke developer wouldn't do and that they would they would in fact be very angry if it came out and it did come out.
3080000	3087000	And it's like, oh, this is actually a breath of fresh air. People who don't care about about appearing a certain way in public.
3087000	3090000	They just say, we'll just we'll just put sexy robots in the game. Fuck it.
3090000	3099000	We'll just put like like I mean, I saw one Twitter streamer like turned the game off because because the main character called a robot a gear head.
3099000	3105000	And she said that she didn't want to promote slurs against robots. Anyway, this is this is way off topic.
3105000	3111000	I guess the point the point that I was getting at is that it was refreshing for how flawed atomic art was.
3111000	3120000	It was refreshing to see some of those things that woke creators, woke artists, woke people who make TV shows or games or movies or whatever.
3120000	3125000	They wouldn't do that stuff. And it was refreshing to see it again.
3125000	3132000	In terms of The Last of Us, this this this is a more, as you say, are two more woke property.
3132000	3138000	But at least the show is, to its credit, at least somewhat accurate. That's nice.
3138000	3142000	But yeah, I'm not I'm not at this point in the show, I'm not expecting anything great.
3142000	3145000	So I've got episode about episode eight here.
3145000	3153000	Episode eight is the second to last episode of the season. For some reason, it's a nine episode season, I think, which is kind of strange.
3153000	3157000	Lucky me.
3157000	3161000	A show made for the fans at least has that going for it.
3161000	3164000	You know, at least it's made for the people who are supposed to enjoy it.
3164000	3167000	I've noticed that they've completely stopped with that.
3167000	3172000	How the virus or how the mushroom started series of flashbacks.
3172000	3174000	It would have been nice if they had one of those every episode.
3174000	3178000	You know, God, no, we don't need any more.
3178000	3183000	I would have enjoyed like little hints of the before times before every episode, as long as it was relevant to the episode.
3183000	3186000	That's just the problem is, is we've mucked around for two whole episodes.
3186000	3191000	I want to just Joel and Ellie do Joel and Ellie stuff.
3191000	3194000	It's a simple request.
3194000	3195000	I want to see more Joel and Ellie.
3195000	3198000	They've replaced little flashbacks with full episodes of flashbacks.
3198000	3201000	Yeah, they're not little anymore, Dev. They're not little anymore.
3201000	3205000	I can't wait till we get like flashbacks inside of flashbacks.
3205000	3210000	Hey, we're not at that point yet. I don't think there's enough episodes for that.
3210000	3213000	Executive director Neil Druckleman.
3213000	3215000	Fucking Druckleman, dude.
3215000	3218000	He's like, bro, I'm going to ruin this franchise.
3218000	3221000	It's like, OK, fair enough. I mean, I can't really call you there, dude.
3221000	3223000	You do you.
3223000	3226000	You own it.
3226000	3227000	That's true.
3227000	3231000	Your toy. You want to break it? Go for it.
3231000	3238000	Joel and Ellie, please.
3238000	3242000	Hey, this is like an average Canadian town.
3242000	3245000	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth.
3245000	3248000	For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.
3248000	3251000	This actually looks like like my town, my hometown.
3251000	3261000	Jesus saying, behold, the tabernacle God is with men.
3261000	3267000	And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
3267000	3269000	Crazy Catholics.
3269000	3276000	Oh, is this going to be like the winter cultists?
3276000	3284000	This was a part of the game.
3284000	3288000	Is this the religion is bad portion of this video game?
3288000	3297000	I think so. They find a cult at some point and Joel kills them all because, of course, it's a video game.
3297000	3308000	I love killing cults in video games like doing like the Boomer cannibal cult.
3308000	3323000	Side story in GTA five and ending up killing them all as Trevor was really fun.
3323000	3325000	It's kind of cold.
3325000	3329000	You got to wait for the ground is too cold to dig.
3329000	3335000	Yeah, I will bury your father in the spring.
3335000	3341000	That's how it is here, man. I'm sure that's how it is in Norway, too.
3341000	3347000	Well, then we have advanced technology called digging machines.
3347000	3351000	OK, we have those here, too, and in bigger cities, they do that.
3351000	3354000	But like in my hometown, they just had like a hut.
3354000	3359000	They put the bodies in and to wait until spring and it would be cold enough to keep them in there.
3359000	3365000	You go in there, Bob. We don't have the technology to bury you yet.
3365000	3372000	It always triggers me when people are in cold environments like this and their front is entirely open.
3372000	3377000	Now go get it. We're going home. You guys should be wearing toques or something.
3377000	3381000	Like at least zip up your jacket like they put it. No, put on your hood.
3381000	3386000	Put on your hood, Nick. Don't worry, Joe.
3386000	3392000	I'm going to go hunt the deer. I don't know how to dress it or what parts they eat or anything like that.
3392000	3396000	But I'm going to hunt the deer. I mean, it's fine. And in survival situation, you don't know how to do that.
3396000	3401000	You might as well fucking try. I can barely use this fucking gun.
3401000	3407000	You're barely twice your size.
3407000	3411000	Fire it like that underarm. It'll be a good way to get rid of that scope.
3411000	3417000	My favorite is when you see people who have the butt of the gun over their shoulder.
3417000	3421000	And that's my favorite. So it's facing downward.
3421000	3426000	No, no. So you've got the actual like butt of the gun, but they put it on top of their shoulder.
3426000	3432000	Oh, my God. Yeah. Jesus. You know, if you shoot that rabbit with that, you're going to have very little rabbit.
3432000	3437000	Yeah. You're going to have a good, fluffy hole, though.
3437000	3443000	Oh, and that gun just went off.
3443000	3447000	I think in the game, Ellie was using a bow by now.
3447000	3452000	I guess they didn't want to level her up that way. You have to teach the actress how to use a bow.
3452000	3458000	Yeah. You also need the arm strength because those aren't easy.
3458000	3463000	Actually, I think the person who plays Ellie came out as non-binary.
3463000	3469000	Like in real life. That kind of makes sense, though. So does that mean?
3469000	3474000	What's the gender neutral term for an actor? It's not actress.
3474000	3478000	It's Jesus objects.
3478000	3484000	What do you want from the actor? I think after itself is a gender neutral.
3484000	3489000	Yes, I don't think it is. It might be. Yeah, I prefer it.
3489000	3496000	Jesus. Oh, you did it.
3496000	3502000	Well, quote close. I mean, I'm surprised that she actually got the shot off is what I mean.
3502000	3508000	People are jerking triggers bleed out.
3508000	3514000	Well, actually, there's a fascinating little thing that happens when it's nice and cold outside.
3514000	3520000	The blood after a while will actually begin to freeze and clog up the wound.
3520000	3526000	Yep. Really nasty.
3526000	3532000	Quickly, whoever shot, it's probably nearby.
3532000	3538000	I don't know where they're going to go.
3538000	3546000	Oh, you can't drag this back on your own.
3547000	3551000	We're not a charity. We we can trade you for some of the deer we have.
3551000	3556000	What do you need? We have boots, medicine.
3556000	3561000	Like for infections. We do back in our village.
3561000	3565000	You're welcome to follow us. I'm not following. Let's ride over there.
3565000	3572000	Wait, where's your fingers? You have a trigger discipline? No, no, no.
3572000	3575000	For a second, there was like, oh, my God, they actually told her about trigger discipline.
3575000	3581000	Now she's wearing her gloves to Padres living dangerously right about now.
3581000	3587000	That's your dad's gun. You're the one that's sick.
3587000	3595000	That's why you're out here on your own. Well, look, it's a four mile round trip back to our settlement.
3595000	3600000	It's going to be a while before James gets back. I have some oil and matches in my pack.
3600000	3605000	Take shelter. Start a fire.
3605000	3610000	I'd suggest you start dressing that deer because, you know, it's cold outside.
3610000	3618000	You know, I know how this turns out, so I can't exactly blame her.
3618000	3621000	But they're religious and post apocalypse dev. They're evil, obviously.
3621000	3627000	Yes, obviously, obviously. But he's been nothing but friendly this whole time.
3627000	3631000	I honestly mean, you know, I feel like this is probably an overreaction from L.A.
3631000	3635000	And for what it's worth, it will be proven not to be. But still, like right now, it's true.
3635000	3639000	There's a reason to be cautious here. It is post apocalypse.
3639000	3646000	What hostile people have they met? So they ran into the communist commune and they were not very friendly.
3646000	3651000	Wasn't my choice. They ran into Tommy's group and his mock Mongolians and they were friendly.
3651000	3656000	So I guess she's 50 50ing it a bit, but better to be safe than sorry.
3656000	3664000	Yeah. Well, you sort of kind of got me there. I am a preacher, but just pretty standard Bible stuff.
3664000	3668000	What the whole world ended and you still believe that shit.
3668000	3672000	I actually started believing after the world ended. Found God after the apocalypse.
3672000	3678000	Oh, God, why? That's how I ended up with our flock. Sometimes people find God.
3679000	3683000	I imagine God is just like in the fridge and it's like, God, why?
3683000	3687000	And he just turns around like, oh, shit, I wasn't paying attention. What happened?
3687000	3694000	And as we wanted, we picked up from stick in his mouth. Turns out he was murdered by this crazy man.
3694000	3702000	And get this. That crazy man was traveling with a little girl.
3702000	3712000	At the same group. Did you bring the medicine? Yeah, but throw it to her. David.
3713000	3720000	Makes me wonder, though, if they've got rifles aplenty, handguns, why they didn't send any of that with the pilfering party.
3720000	3730000	But, yeah, the story demanded they be poorly armed, I guess those four guys attacked Joel first.
3730000	3735000	Right. Yeah, because they had their backs turned. Yeah. Yep. They charged him.
3738000	3746000	Do you know how this works, Ellie? Joel, where the fuck do I put this?
3750000	3754000	I don't know. He's allergic to penicillin.
3755000	3761000	I'll just stick it right here. That'll work. Right there. All the way in.
3761000	3765000	Just pump it straight into his internal organs. Good.
3768000	3774000	I knew she'd been better off either coating the wound or putting it in their arm, but hey, details, it works.
3774000	3779000	You know, I'm just happy we're back on with the story. Yes.
3779000	3783000	And that it is, you know, more or less what the game was again.
3783000	3787000	I know I'm like a broken record on that, but it's refreshing to see.
3788000	3794000	It's a story. It has characters. I even know some of them.
3794000	3801000	Lilith and Kibs, how much do you two remember about the religious cultists in this game?
3803000	3807000	I don't remember nothing at this point. No? Were they cannibals?
3807000	3811000	I remember the ending. I don't think these were the cannibals. I don't think.
3812000	3814000	What is it?
3816000	3819000	Are you sure? Maybe they are the cannibals.
3820000	3827000	What do you think that guy was? They just got a deer, so I don't see why they'd eat each other right now.
3828000	3831000	We could eat the deer, or Bob.
3831000	3835000	Oh, well, that one father just died, remember?
3835000	3837000	Yep. I know, but again...
3837000	3840000	No, because here's the deer. Here's the deer.
3841000	3844000	Ah. So these are the cannibals. Maybe it is, Bob.
3845000	3846000	Yeah.
3846000	3850000	To be fair, if you're starving and you have a dead body...
3850000	3851000	Yeah.
3852000	3856000	I can see the argument. It is, however, what we call a long-term health risk.
3856000	3858000	And avoid the brain stems.
3859000	3862000	Yes. We found a girl who was with the man who took Alec from us.
3862000	3864000	How did he hear a rumor when he just got back?
3864000	3865000	I don't know.
3865000	3867000	When the sun rises, I'll lead a group out to pick up her trail.
3867000	3869000	Well, the other dude did come back for a moment, I guess, maybe?
3869000	3870000	Or...
3870000	3871000	Because he did get the penicillin.
3872000	3874000	And we'll bring that man to justice.
3875000	3878000	You should kill him. You should kill both of them.
3881000	3882000	Ugh.
3883000	3885000	Women. Always so bloodthirsty.
3886000	3887000	Jesus.
3889000	3891000	Now you know where the back is.
3891000	3893000	The Lord speaketh of the back of his hand.
3894000	3899000	I'm sorry I had to hit you, child, but we had to establish that we were actually the bad guys.
3899000	3901000	Now go on and eat your own dad.
3902000	3903000	It's in the soup.
3903000	3905000	Uh-huh. Your father is soup.
3908000	3909000	Thank you.
3909000	3912000	What do you mean you don't have a dad anymore? He's right here, points to Platter.
3913000	3916000	Blesseth with Christ, the living bread.
3918000	3919000	Amen.
3919000	3922000	Yes, he withal eating the body of Christ, I think.
3922000	3923000	Yep.
3926000	3930000	And the way that they're just focusing on the food, yeah, this is the cannibals, okay.
3930000	3932000	Making it gross.
3934000	3935000	Bob was delicious.
3936000	3940000	I mean, I can understand a desperate situation, but it sucks.
3942000	3948000	Well, it's the thing. If they ate him because they were out of food, then fair enough.
3948000	3951000	Yeah, they didn't just, like, kill a random person. He was already dead.
3951000	3953000	Waste that whatnot.
3953000	3954000	Mm-hmm.
3954000	3958000	If they eat random people for fists and giggles, however, it'll be different.
3958000	3961000	I'll inject it right there again. It'll be okay. Ah, fuck.
3963000	3965000	That's not how this works, Ellie?
3965000	3967000	That is not how that works, no.
3968000	3972000	But she's filling up his stomach cavity with lots of penicillin.
3973000	3977000	To be fair, you know, it'll be absorbed through the skin eventually.
3977000	3978000	Ellie got there.
3978000	3981000	Dude, eat your horse at this point. You're gonna be camped out here for a while.
3981000	3983000	Ellie doesn't know how to brush her tracks in the snow.
3983000	3988000	Wait, wait, wait. You can't feed a horse snow. You can't eat snow yourself.
3988000	3993000	Well, you can. I wouldn't recommend it in the long run, but again, if you're desperate.
3994000	3999000	You have to let the snow melt into water first before you drink it.
3999000	4001000	Like, it's not gonna hydrate you like that,
4001000	4005000	because the amount of energy that your body uses up to melt it.
4005000	4008000	I don't know what kind of snow you have, Dev.
4008000	4011000	There's something about snow causing dehydration long-term.
4012000	4013000	Long-term probably is.
4013000	4016000	Now, if you were smart, you'd boil it first, because, uh,
4016000	4019000	well, there are many wonderful things that live in snow.
4019000	4020000	Ah, yes.
4021000	4025000	We're a stealthy hunting party, hunting a dangerous man who kills one of us,
4025000	4028000	which is why we're walking in the middle of the fucking streets.
4028000	4029000	Daylight.
4031000	4034000	You wouldn't want to be sneaky or anything. That'd be stupid.
4040000	4044000	Just another mouth to feed, or another hole to breed.
4044000	4045000	Jesus.
4045000	4048000	I couldn't resist. It was too good. It rhymed and everything.
4050000	4052000	Down here, you fucking kill them. You got it?
4053000	4054000	Joel.
4054000	4056000	Joel, do not fall asleep.
4059000	4062000	He's like, bro, I hurt. Am I everything hurts?
4062000	4065000	Also, I'm going to say, oh god.
4071000	4074000	Well, if they didn't know I was here before, that'll do it.
4075000	4076000	Yep.
4076000	4077000	Come on.
4078000	4081000	I mean, has the horse been eating?
4083000	4085000	Uh, no.
4085000	4087000	To be fair, I like...
4087000	4089000	Must have packed horse food. Feed.
4089000	4091000	Listen, this is fake Hollywood snows.
4091000	4093000	There's probably some grass for it to munch somewhere.
4093000	4095000	It's like bushes inside.
4095000	4096000	Fuckers!
4105000	4108000	Ancient Mongolian horse gunnery.
4117000	4119000	Keep cutting fuckers.
4120000	4121000	Yep.
4125000	4127000	Now they can eat the horse.
4127000	4129000	They've solved the food situation.
4129000	4135000	Yeah, didn't this guy want Ellie to, like, be his underage wife or something?
4137000	4140000	I think that might have... I can't remember.
4140000	4142000	It's been too long since I played the game.
4142000	4144000	Damn, that's kind of creepy, though.
4144000	4147000	It sounds like something that's going on, though, doesn't it?
4147000	4148000	Of course.
4149000	4152000	The rest of you, stay here, go door to door.
4154000	4156000	You so hungry for vengeance?
4157000	4159000	Deliver it.
4165000	4166000	Jesus.
4167000	4171000	They got a creepy looking guy to play this part.
4171000	4175000	Wow, just because he's ginger deaf, wow, a little bit of racism.
4176000	4181000	Well, at least he plays the creepy look well, I guess.
4181000	4182000	He has...
4182000	4185000	Soulless eyes, is that what you're going for, Dev? Jesus.
4185000	4187000	God damn it!
4188000	4190000	Get your knife ready.
4198000	4202000	Man, Ellie should have at least, like, dragged him underneath the stairs or something.
4205000	4219000	I have no senses. Ice approaching.
4219000	4222000	Hmm, a bloody mattress. I should continue.
4224000	4228000	I should definitely not call with my friends, since this is definitely not where he is.
4228000	4230000	He wants to kill, though.
4232000	4234000	Also, that beard, you deserve this.
4235000	4240000	Now you have more people to eat.
4241000	4242000	Hungry.
4244000	4247000	Why do you think he sent them on their little vengeance quest?
4247000	4249000	He's racking up food.
4250000	4253000	This is quite, uh, quite slow.
4254000	4256000	Joel can barely fucking do it.
4261000	4262000	Jesus.
4266000	4269000	Good job, man, who couldn't move five seconds ago.
4270000	4272000	He probably fucked up his stitches, though.
4273000	4274000	Stitches?
4274000	4275000	The stitches.
4276000	4277000	Alright, she did...
4277000	4280000	Well, did she even have threads, though?
4280000	4282000	She's just stabbing him for just some giggles.
4282000	4283000	Oh my god, bro.
4283000	4285000	No, she found threads. She found threads in the last episode.
4285000	4286000	You're too busy cleaning your mouse.
4286000	4290000	He was so busy playing his phone game that he didn't even watch the other episode.
4290000	4292000	I mean, I don't even blame him.
4293000	4296000	At the end of the flashback, she found a thread.
4297000	4299000	Oh god, this is going to get weird, isn't it?
4299000	4300000	Yeah.
4302000	4304000	I think this is the...
4305000	4308000	The veterinarian's place in town.
4314000	4316000	They really make it look like the place in the game.
4320000	4321000	Oh, hey.
4322000	4323000	I just realized.
4324000	4325000	I was prophetic.
4326000	4328000	Another mouse to feed, another hole to breathe.
4328000	4329000	I called it.
4329000	4330000	Hey, listen to me.
4330000	4335000	It's okay, he's just setting up one of those Deep South child beauty pageants.
4336000	4337000	That's what he wants her for.
4337000	4338000	Timothy.
4340000	4342000	Oh, so long as there's nothing weird, I guess.
4343000	4344000	I like how they actually split up.
4344000	4346000	These guys deserve what's coming.
4346000	4347000	Yeah.
4349000	4350000	Timothy.
4351000	4352000	Well, can I park with him?
4352000	4356000	It's always a good idea to split up and to cover my ground, okay?
4356000	4359000	I like how Joel's just killing them all.
4359000	4362000	He's barely conscious and he's like, nope.
4362000	4367000	My non-toxic masculinity will pull me through this.
4371000	4373000	I'm going to kill all these misogynists.
4373000	4374000	I don't know any girl.
4375000	4377000	Oh, Jesus!
4379000	4380000	Michael.
4381000	4382000	He can't help you.
4382000	4385000	You focus right here or I'll pop your fucking kneecap off.
4386000	4387000	Jesus.
4387000	4389000	I think this was in the game, right?
4389000	4390000	Yeah.
4390000	4391000	Just interrogating them.
4391000	4392000	Yeah, this is from the game.
4392000	4393000	Interrogating to me.
4393000	4395000	Oh, the town.
4395000	4396000	What town?
4398000	4399000	Cooper Lane.
4400000	4404000	You got to get directions out of him?
4405000	4406000	Oh, no.
4406000	4407000	He knows we're civil, I guess.
4407000	4408000	We got a map.
4415000	4416000	Jesus Christ.
4419000	4421000	Non-toxic masculinity.
4430000	4431000	It's okay.
4432000	4433000	I believe him.
4436000	4437000	Jesus.
4440000	4442000	Yeah, that's pretty much how it went in the game.
4449000	4452000	You just got to inject it right in there, Arch.
4455000	4458000	Here, have some people soup.
4459000	4460000	Or me.
4463000	4465000	Just in case it wasn't obvious enough.
4465000	4467000	That's for the brain dead of yours.
4467000	4469000	For what it's worth, this is just dear meat, I swear.
4472000	4474000	You're going to chop me up into little pieces.
4474000	4476000	If you want to judge me.
4476000	4477000	Judge you?
4477000	4479000	You're eating people, you sick fuck!
4481000	4482000	It was a last resort.
4482000	4484000	You think it doesn't shame me?
4485000	4487000	But what was I supposed to do?
4487000	4488000	Let them starve?
4488000	4490000	These people who put their lives in my hands?
4491000	4493000	Who expect me to keep them safe?
4493000	4494000	Who love me?
4494000	4495000	Yeah, maybe.
4497000	4499000	I don't know if I agree with Ellie here.
4499000	4501000	No, that's a retarded position.
4501000	4503000	I'm like, yeah, you should just all have died.
4503000	4504000	Why?
4504000	4506000	You remind me of me.
4506000	4508000	You're a natural leader.
4508000	4509000	You're smart.
4509000	4510000	Loyal.
4512000	4513000	Violent.
4513000	4514000	Violent.
4517000	4518000	Wow.
4518000	4520000	You read a lot of that script off screen, didn't you?
4521000	4523000	You have a violent heart.
4523000	4525000	And I should know.
4527000	4529000	I'm a little bit of a user myself, actually.
4529000	4530000	They need God.
4530000	4531000	They need heaven.
4531000	4532000	They need...
4535000	4536000	They need a father.
4537000	4538000	You don't.
4539000	4540000	You're beyond that.
4541000	4542000	You are fatherless.
4542000	4544000	I'm surrounded by sheep.
4544000	4545000	Fatherless behavior.
4546000	4548000	Damn, he bonded hard over this chick.
4548000	4550000	You met, like, five minutes.
4550000	4551000	Like I said, loyal.
4551000	4552000	Yeah.
4553000	4555000	He just wants to bone her.
4555000	4556000	That's what this is.
4556000	4558000	I can tell the others to stop looking for him.
4558000	4561000	The script says I have a weird attraction to young girls.
4561000	4563000	Well, better roll with it.
4563000	4564000	Really?
4564000	4565000	They're paying me.
4565000	4566000	I just let him go?
4566000	4567000	Yes.
4568000	4571000	If he leaves us in peace, they will just let him go.
4572000	4573000	Well...
4573000	4574000	They do what I tell them to do.
4576000	4577000	That bridge is already burnt.
4578000	4581000	I can't get what they're doing here, but Jesus Christ, he's...
4582000	4584000	This is some love at first sight level shit here.
4584000	4586000	Like, I've always wooed you.
4586000	4587000	We can be man and wife.
4587000	4589000	We can lead this group of crazy people together.
4590000	4591000	We grow.
4592000	4593000	Spread out.
4594000	4595000	And we do whatever we need.
4595000	4597000	A little bit of zero to sixty, but alright.
4599000	4602000	I think it works this time, because he's just clearly nuts.
4604000	4608000	I suppose, but like, the only thing he's doing that's nuts is this.
4608000	4611000	Like, the other decisions have been fairly irrational.
4611000	4614000	The nuts part is just that he's like, alright, kiddie, yes.
4617000	4620000	This is a deep south marriage, guys.
4621000	4623000	Like, the very first scene...
4623000	4624000	Oh!
4626000	4627000	Oh, God!
4628000	4630000	Yep, he was thinking with his dick.
4632000	4633000	That's grody.
4634000	4635000	He deserved that.
4635000	4636000	You little cunt.
4641000	4643000	Let's see what I go tell the others now.
4645000	4646000	Ellie.
4647000	4648000	What?
4649000	4650000	What?
4650000	4655000	Tell them that Ellie is a little girl who broke her fucking finger!
4657000	4658000	How did you put it?
4659000	4660000	Tiny little pieces?
4662000	4663000	That's funny.
4665000	4666000	You say, well, where?
4666000	4668000	We chopped up our pieces.
4669000	4670000	Most unfortunate.
4673000	4674000	Damn.
4679000	4681000	You see, I wouldn't have done what she did.
4681000	4684000	I would have pretended to play along for a while.
4685000	4690000	You would have become, like, the priest's concubine until you could escape?
4690000	4692000	I could just, like, stab him.
4693000	4694000	In the middle of the night?
4694000	4695000	While he's sleeping.
4695000	4696000	Yeah.
4696000	4697000	And get away.
4697000	4702000	The thing is, you can just also wait until he buys it, and then you sneak out.
4702000	4703000	Oh, okay.
4703000	4705000	Yeah, at the very least, wait until he unlocks the cell door.
4705000	4706000	Yeah.
4707000	4710000	This was, in my opinion, the most unbelievable part of the game.
4710000	4713000	Because Joel is still fucked up.
4713000	4715000	Like, from his wound.
4715000	4717000	He has a murder rampage.
4717000	4719000	He just murders fucking everyone.
4719000	4720000	It's like, alright, alright, dude.
4720000	4722000	That's a bit too video game for me.
4723000	4728000	He had a bleeding, septic, fucking stomach wound about an hour ago.
4728000	4729000	Yeah.
4729000	4731000	Mark, you got better, okay?
4731000	4732000	And Joe Allen.
4733000	4736000	The story kind of demands that he be a little bit more effective.
4736000	4738000	He pressed the heal button, Arch.
4738000	4740000	Clearly, you don't know anything.
4741000	4743000	He found one of the healing packs.
4743000	4745000	He held down the X button.
4746000	4749000	He's invoking, as I said, his non-toxic masculinity.
4753000	4755000	Listen, I found a health pack. I'm good.
4756000	4758000	There's the horse.
4759000	4760000	I guess they'll eat that later.
4760000	4763000	You really should leave that outside, actually, in these circumstances.
4763000	4764000	It'll freeze better.
4764000	4766000	And there's the people that they're eating.
4777000	4779000	It's ganger ape time.
4781000	4782000	Fun for all the family.
4782000	4783000	What?
4788000	4789000	Oh, no, they're just gonna eat her.
4789000	4791000	Well, I suppose that's merciful.
4791000	4793000	Don't do it! Please, don't do it! Please, don't!
4793000	4794000	You had your chance!
4794000	4796000	Don't! I'm infected!
4797000	4798000	I'm infected.
4800000	4802000	And now so are you.
4804000	4806000	Roll up my sleeve. Look at it.
4806000	4807000	Look at it!
4811000	4812000	It's part of your hair.
4816000	4817000	What did you say?
4818000	4820000	Everything happens for a reason, right?
4822000	4824000	I wonder if she can infect people.
4832000	4833000	Oh, shit!
4833000	4835000	Ooh, damn!
4837000	4838000	That looks pretty real to me, too.
4838000	4840000	That was pretty impressive.
4840000	4845000	Not only did they let her do that, but he missed a series of point-blank shots.
4845000	4847000	Good job, both of you.
4847000	4850000	I mean, we've kind of established he's a Pascafist.
4850000	4851000	He's not very good at gun.
4853000	4854000	It's gun stat, super low.
4854000	4856000	It's charisma stat, also low.
4858000	4860000	Unseriously removes it.
4861000	4863000	Aw, more food for later.
4864000	4865000	Oh my god, burn him.
4865000	4867000	Lul, that'd be so funny.
4869000	4870000	Burn his dick.
4872000	4874000	Oh, no, that's a video game torch.
4874000	4876000	Yep, that's gonna catch.
4876000	4877000	Awfully quick.
4877000	4879000	Yep, there it goes.
4882000	4884000	Yeah, don't even bother trying to put that out.
4884000	4886000	That's a video game torch, my dude.
4887000	4888000	It's gonna burn.
4892000	4894000	I do love how he doesn't even try.
4894000	4895000	He doesn't say anything.
4895000	4896000	He doesn't call for help.
4896000	4897000	Like, bye!
4898000	4899000	Damn.
4899000	4900000	It's a boss fight, Arch.
4900000	4901000	It's a video game.
4902000	4903000	And he realizes this.
4903000	4905000	I'm the boss in a video game.
4905000	4906000	This is ambiance.
4906000	4908000	Holy shit, it's overbur-
4909000	4910000	Wow, the fucking beeps are-
4911000	4916000	Listen, they doused it in gasoline before they started living here.
4916000	4917000	Part of the ritual, okay?
4918000	4920000	I actually really like that they're doing this.
4920000	4924000	Because you did have to basically take this guy on with no weapons as Ellie.
4925000	4928000	Or are you just that fucking special?
4930000	4932000	No one likes being humiliated, Ellie.
4933000	4935000	You don't know how good I am!
4935000	4936000	That's not true.
4936000	4937000	Some people have that as a fetish.
4937000	4939000	You don't know what I could have given you!
4940000	4942000	This guy's the ultimate nice guy!
4943000	4945000	He's like, I'm super simpy!
4945000	4946000	I'm gonna miss you.
4948000	4949000	Ellie...
4952000	4953000	Hold it down, you trust me.
4955000	4958000	You whispered her name in a very creepy fashion.
4958000	4959000	Fuck!
4959000	4960000	Yeah.
4960000	4961000	Yeah.
4961000	4963000	Resistance only makes me harder.
4964000	4965000	Go, go, run!
4970000	4971000	Oh no.
4971000	4972000	I think it's weird.
4979000	4980000	Ha! Told you.
4980000	4981000	Oh no.
4981000	4982000	Oh man.
4983000	4985000	There's no fear in love.
4988000	4990000	You're gonna fucking hit him.
4990000	4991000	Please.
4994000	4996000	I love how this guy...
4996000	4999000	Like, the entire building is on fire.
4999000	5001000	Like, he's fighting a chick with a big cleaver.
5001000	5004000	And all I can think of is like, hmm, he'd be hard.
5004000	5005000	Ha ha ha ha!
5010000	5011000	Yes, yes, we got it.
5011000	5012000	We get it.
5012000	5013000	He was a bad person.
5014000	5015000	Show me the body.
5017000	5019000	Now I don't require too much makeup.
5019000	5020000	Makeup?
5020000	5021000	It would require them to make, like, a prop.
5021000	5023000	Because there wouldn't be much of that face left.
5023000	5024000	It was a nice play.
5024000	5025000	Bit too expensive.
5029000	5031000	See, that was such a missed opportunity.
5031000	5032000	Get off of me!
5032000	5033000	Get off of me!
5033000	5034000	Get off of me!
5037000	5038000	Yeah, that's a good question.
5038000	5040000	Where is everyone else?
5040000	5042000	The whole town's just...
5043000	5045000	Joel's the guy that killed them all.
5046000	5047000	I'm fine now, by the way.
5048000	5049000	Yeah.
5049000	5050000	Yep, I'm good.
5050000	5052000	Thank you for that penicillin injection into my stomach.
5052000	5053000	It really helped my heart.
5053000	5056000	Even though I just killed this entire town, we're not gonna loot it or anything.
5056000	5058000	We're not gonna take a vehicle or any of their food.
5058000	5059000	We're just gonna go.
5060000	5062000	Their food, their weapons, their fuel.
5062000	5065000	Or use some shelter to rest after all this, you know, stuff.
5065000	5066000	I'll be too big for her.
5066000	5068000	I don't think we would like to take their food.
5070000	5072000	I think there's a deer and a dead horse there.
5072000	5073000	Yeah, we can use that.
5073000	5076000	The deer's used up, but the horse is good.
5078000	5079000	Oh.
5079000	5080000	Wait.
5081000	5082000	That ended real quick.
5082000	5083000	That was an hour, Dev.
5083000	5086000	That's a long time, you little shite.
5086000	5088000	Yeah, but this time something actually happens.
5088000	5089000	I know.
5089000	5091000	So it went faster because it was kind of fun.
5092000	5093000	There was violence.
5093000	5094000	There was murdering.
5095000	5096000	There was a bit of creepy stuff.
5096000	5097000	A girl almost got raped.
5097000	5098000	I just noticed something.
5098000	5099000	Didn't like that part.
5100000	5101000	I just noticed something.
5101000	5103000	So the credits said Troy Baker.
5103000	5105000	This guy is Troy Baker, I think.
5106000	5109000	His right-handed man throughout the episode.
5109000	5115000	And Troy Baker is actually a bit of a nod to the fans because he was the voice actor for Joel.
5116000	5117000	Damn.
5117000	5124000	They apparently grabbed a bunch of the voice actors from the game and just gave them small roles scattered throughout the season.
5124000	5132000	So instead of doing what the Dead Space remake did, where they made the main characters actually just take on the roles of the people,
5132000	5138000	they replaced them with more prominent actors and had them play second fiddle in their own series.
5138000	5139000	Yes.
5139000	5140000	Damn.
5140000	5141000	A bit of an F.U.
5141000	5142000	A bit of an F.U.
5144000	5147000	I mean, it was nice of them to include them at all, but yes.
5147000	5151000	At least they included them, but like as a side character.
5151000	5155000	It's a middle finger with a little bit of, you know, a little bit of goodness on it, too.
5155000	5156000	Yeah.
5156000	5157000	A little bit of good.
5157000	5158000	A little bit of bitter.
5158000	5167000	So this episode was very much like the part of the game that it was covering.
5167000	5169000	The characters were pretty much spot on.
5169000	5171000	The locations were pretty much spot on.
5171000	5177000	The fact that the town is now suddenly empty and no one else came to help is a bit strange, but fine.
5177000	5178000	We'll just accept it.
5180000	5184000	The only issue is that it felt a little bit rushed.
5184000	5195000	And that's a really damning thing to say, considering how in other episodes that we've talked about before, they just take their sweet fucking time doing nothing.
5195000	5196000	Yep.
5196000	5201000	This is not a show that could afford to waste two episodes worth of time.
5201000	5202000	I completely agree.
5202000	5212000	Like, the Kansas City, the queues, there weren't fireflies, there were other rebels that overthrew the Federer in Kansas City.
5212000	5215000	That needed a full extra episode to cook.
5215000	5219000	And this one probably also needed a full extra episode to cook.
5219000	5221000	And instead we got those flashback episodes.
5221000	5228000	So I do think that the show could have been better if it didn't shoot itself in the foot in that way.
5228000	5230000	That's my take on it, though.
5230000	5233000	Because this was actually more fun, and I wish it was longer.
5233000	5236000	And I wish they had more build up.
5236000	5239000	With the characters and the whole reveal of them being cannibals.
5239000	5241000	It was way too on the nose about the cannibal part.
5241000	5242000	Yep.
5242000	5243000	More subtlety.
5243000	5245000	They could definitely learn that lesson.
5245000	5248000	Let's talk about this food we're having, huh?
5248000	5253000	Guys, these big red plops of meat, that's bringing attention to it.
5253000	5259000	Like, probably not pointing towards the thing.
5259000	5264000	Yeah, in shows, there's often the trope where it's like, what's the meat?
5264000	5267000	And then it looks over and it's just very raw, very red meat.
5267000	5271000	And the characters just wait for an extra second longer than they should.
5271000	5273000	And it's like, okay, we get it.
5273000	5274000	That's human.
5274000	5276000	That's human meat.
5276000	5279000	For whatever reason, they never cook it, too, so it looks very gross.
5279000	5280000	Yeah.
5280000	5282000	It's very on the nose.
5282000	5283000	Or in this case, the ear.
5283000	5285000	We've got one episode left, I think.
5285000	5287000	Hold on, let's get it done.
5287000	5288000	Let's get it over with.
5288000	5289000	Well, not today.
5289000	5290000	It's next week, man.
5290000	5291000	It's next week.
5291000	5292000	Go find it.
5292000	5293000	Yeah, go steal it.
5293000	5299000	Well, the issue is, they now have to survive the winter.
5299000	5301000	There's an extra sequence.
5301000	5307000	They survive the winter, and then they get to Salt Lake City.
5307000	5310000	And then there's a whole fucking shit show at Salt Lake City.
5310000	5315000	Then they have to go back to Tommy's town.
5315000	5318000	So, I'm not sure if they can fit all of it in one episode.
5318000	5320000	They gotta do that in one episode.
5320000	5321000	Yeah.
5321000	5324000	They gotta cram it because of all this crappy filler, or it's just gonna skim like 90% of
5324000	5325000	the stuff.
5325000	5329000	Yeah, there's like a big thing with the fireflies in Salt Lake City, and then they go back.
5329000	5332000	I feel like the pacing of the show is gonna be its downfall.
5332000	5335000	They spent too much time on other shit that didn't matter.
5335000	5337000	Any of you three have final thoughts?
5337000	5339000	I would have eaten the horse.
5339000	5343000	This episode was more violent, and I liked that part.
5343000	5344000	That's about it.
5344000	5349000	I think the destroying the pedal rapist was very empowering.
5349000	5354000	It was very good watching Ellie just stab him for a full minute where that's all there
5354000	5355000	was.
5355000	5358000	It would be nice to see the corpse, but...
5358000	5359000	Yeah.
5359000	5360000	Hold on, Jesus.
5360000	5362000	Bloodthirsty Lilith over here.
5362000	5363000	No, no, no.
5363000	5365000	Lilith is right, actually.
5365000	5369000	This show has already shown that it's violent and grotesque, right?
5369000	5374000	So why not actually make up a prop doll dummy of that actor, and then have her go to town
5374000	5375000	on it and show it?
5375000	5376000	That'd be kinda fun.
5377000	5386000	Walking Dead Season 2, the game, the second one, they did that with the villain that got
5386000	5387000	beaten to death.
5387000	5392000	They actually showed the corpse, but it was a video game.
5392000	5394000	It's been so long since I played it.
5394000	5395000	It's been at least five or six years.
5395000	5396000	I recall that, though.
5396000	5397000	Yeah, I recall.
5397000	5404000	Well, in the end, you're like, Kenny gets to beat the villain to death, and you're given
5404000	5407000	a choice of watching or not.
5407000	5408000	Right, yes.
5408000	5409000	Yeah.
5409000	5411000	So, two more episodes down.
5411000	5413000	We're coming across the end.
5413000	5418000	We'll reunite one final time next week to watch the finale, unless my math is wrong.
5418000	5420000	I don't know why they have a nine-episode season.
5420000	5422000	It's very strange, but I guess that's what they're doing.
5422000	5424000	And then, I guess after that, what are we doing?
5424000	5426000	Are we watching the Halo show, Kibs?
5426000	5428000	Halo Season 2?
5428000	5429000	Yes.
5429000	5431000	I've said yes on behalf of Kibs.
5431000	5433000	Kibs will rewatch the Halo show.
5433000	5435000	What's my revenge after that?
5435000	5436000	Because this is my revenge.
5436000	5438000	You already owe me Dota.
5438000	5441000	Consider this the Dota.
5441000	5444000	He's like, I will wash away the debt with your tears.
5444000	5449000	I will sacrifice Dota for you watching the entirety of Halo.
5449000	5453000	You know, there is no limit to bad shows nowadays.
5453000	5455000	Like, you want to go watch Velma?
5455000	5459000	You want to go watch the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air remake?
5459000	5461000	I watched it.
5461000	5464000	That was just sad.
5464000	5468000	I remember Arch lamenting about it every episode he'd watch.
5468000	5472000	Oh, we can go watch Season 2 of Rings of Power.
5472000	5474000	That'll be coming out, like, the end of the year.
5474000	5476000	Oh, yay, Deb.
5476000	5479000	I'm glad of all these stellar recommendations.
5479000	5482000	Like, honestly, this is not a good trend.
5482000	5484000	We need to cover some good shows once in a while.
5484000	5487000	Otherwise, we're going to get stuck in the loop when the pendulum swing happens
5487000	5489000	and good TV starts coming out.
5489000	5490000	We're going to be in the dust.
5490000	5492000	This was the good show.
5492000	5493000	This was the good show, yeah.
5493000	5496000	All right, come here, you little shit.
5496000	5498000	So we'll see you guys next week.
5498000	5499000	Say goodbye, everyone.
5499000	5501000	Goodbye.
5501000	5502000	Take care.
