00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Welcome back, everyone. We're doing another, um, another doubleheader tonight because real life seems to get in the way of everything all the time. All of our jobs and all of our, all of our commitments and all of Kib's streams. We just, we just can't seem to get it together, but we're here.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Wow, he name dropped me.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, he's singling me out.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
All of us, Kibs!

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
All of us, all of us, but you more than the rest.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You deserve it. You can always move your streams. Your streams are flexible. I can now move my shit.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's right.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is your fault.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Arch and Lilith, you both work outside of the house.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yep.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Unlike a lot of people, I have a job.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, my job is streaming.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So we are here watching The Last of Us episodes seven, which was last week's episodes that we missed and eight, which is today's episode. So at least something's going to be new.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Real quick before we start, since it's been two weeks, the last episode that we watched was the point where the show seemed to start to go downhill for me quite a bit because they ruined that very important Ellie Joel scene by undercutting all of its emotional impact.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
By having that Joel Tommy scene in the workshop where Joel talks about having panic attacks, which was not in the game that was added.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You all might not be too surprised with this, but the Internet doesn't agree with me. The Internet loved that episode.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In fact, there's a bunch of articles floating around like this one on, let's say, more progressive leaning media sites.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This one is titled The Last of Us.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Joel exemplifies the strength of non-toxic masculinity.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Now, this is a long, boring article, as a lot of these articles tend to be.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The point basically is, is that because Joel had that moment of weakness where he talks honestly about his inability to care for Ellie and how how he's weak and it bothers him.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He is an example of non-toxic masculinity.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So can any of you point out the issue with with this line of logic?

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, it's simple. Masculinity is being strong and capable.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Non-toxic masculinity is being weak and having fucking heart attacks because...

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's part of the problem.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you look at, let's say, characters that are traditionally masculine, that progressives would call toxic masculine, like toxically masculine, they have toxic masculinity.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We can even stay within the realm of pop culture.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can look at Superman, you can look at, let's say, Jean-Luc Picard, you can look at Han Solo, let's say.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
These are all toxically masculine characters because they're too strong, they're too sure of themselves, forge the path forward and they disregard others' opinions sometimes.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Han Solo especially is a womanizer.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So there you go, they're objectifying women and they're not, they're toxically masculine.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:59,000
OK, the issue ultimately is that Joel admits in the show to being a murderer and not just, you know, you kill someone in self-defense because you had to or you're facing off against an evil enemy.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No, he admits in the show, he jumped innocent people to take their stuff to survive.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now, as far as I understand, the heroes of old, of the previous generation that exemplify toxic masculinity, they didn't do that.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Like, Han Solo was the thief with the heart of gold, right?

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Like, he didn't just kill people for no reason or for like very self-serving reasons.

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Joel did.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's very strange because these people, they're putting forward this narrative that you can actually be the worst type of person, but as long as you cry about it later, then you're not toxic.

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yep.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's the whole like, oh, I feel bad.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You know, I maybe was a murdering psychopath, but I felt bad about it.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So I'm, you know, a good guy now.

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's, oh, fuck.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
As the old saying goes, it's a feeling that counts, okay?

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is that the old saying?

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So that's what happened in the last episode.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is how the internet took it.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Apparently leftoids loved that episode.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I thought it was absolute dog shit.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But it's time for us to watch the next one.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I just switch over here again, if you don't mind.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I do mind actually.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, sorry.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Why did you even ask?

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is just a normal American suburb right now.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Even the house.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Leave.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Leave.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Shut up, Joel.

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Take the gun.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Joel, shut the fuck up!

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The Mandalorian started up, right?

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yep.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I guess Pedro Pascal just likes taking care of orphans now.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's what he does.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't remember the last part of The Last of Us that well.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So did she actually just leave them in the game?

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, in the game, they just stayed there for like three months and healed them up.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And she just scavenged to get them alive.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So she might not necessarily have just outright left, just started leaving.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I wasn't the fastest. I wasn't the smartest.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Fight about it?

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't fight.

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
She's not here anymore.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Is she?

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The hipster effect.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sure her shitty pace will pick up by standing there for a few minutes.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, are they doing the DLC in this episode?

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yep, I think so.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
My name's Kwon.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh my god, it reminds me of the Halo TV show.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Stop, Kwon.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I care because no matter what anyone out there says or thinks,

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
we're the only thing holding this all together.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If we go down, the people in this zone will starve or murder each other that much I know.

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Considering what we've seen, that seems to be the truth.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He's right.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
For all the evil that Fedra is.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I too believe the fascist oppressor is our best hope.

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's what they're implying.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Which way, Western woman-girl-thing child?

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't do it, Ellie. Don't give in to the fascism.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
She did.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
She's a freak.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Captain Wong is being so nice.

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Is that it?

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's it.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Sam Ting Wong?

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Can I have my Walkman back?

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You know, I should be offended by that, but I'm not. It was funny.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Now, this is fiction right here, because I've been told repeatedly there were no black comic characters ever.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Ha ha ha ha!

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Uh oh.

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Boogaloo.

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Boogaloo boogaloo.

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a flashback. It's her girlfriend.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Whoa.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes, she was black.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And you said ooga booga when she was coming in through the fucking window.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Damn.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You racist.

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh my goodness.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I can't believe you did that.

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Nope, that's staying.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Could you add in some jungle drums as well?

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Keep it quiet, Harry.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Remember now.

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This better be good.

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And there they are. There's the guards.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh yeah, immediately perfectly correct.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Arch, how did you know that this was a lesbian romance situation?

123
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Because you told me about it before.

124
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, you told him, literally.

125
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh shit, did I spoil this? Did I spoil the DLC?

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You did.

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh fuck.

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Like, this has been common knowledge for a while now.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You spoil the entire story to him.

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh shit, sorry Arch.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Wait, Canadians are always sorry. That's the point.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Sorry doesn't mean anything to a Canadian.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's basically like, go fuck yourself.

134
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Personally, I'm quite fond of lesbians, but I prefer if they were hot and adults.

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And not fucking children. I was going to say not fucking children.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
This is weird in the game, too.

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, they're ages in the game where I think 14 and 17.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is just my racism speaking here, but I fucking hate dreads.

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Like, they just look bad. I don't like them.

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I object.

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You object to dreads?

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
How many floors?

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I do.

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You know what?

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I think they can be done right.

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Lots of people do them in a good way.

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I've never banged a girl with dreads before.

148
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, yeah.

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, thanks, Steph. Thanks for letting her bitch.

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Hold on, hold on.

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I've never banged a girl with dreads before, and I want to at least once.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Before I completely rule it out.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There's probably not as much black people in Canada, though.

154
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No, there's not. No.

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's a Bombay.

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But that kind of dreads, where you have like a dread ponytail?

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I just expect there to be something living inside of it.

158
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You can keep dreads clean, like, and most people do.

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They're not doing that in the post-apocalypse, though.

160
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, no!

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't think floors break that way.

162
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No.

163
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
They don't.

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That would have to be cut and set up like that.

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Dead guy fell on the ground.

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Are we endearing?

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I guess we're going to drink his old, gross booze.

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Lauren's urine.

169
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Depends.

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And not even wonder what the fuck it is.

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah, like, Jesus.

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You know, despite all of our tripping.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What if he had cordyceps and...

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh.

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He had cordyceps and now they're infected from drinking.

176
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I know. I mean, I know.

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, no.

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No, it's fine.

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm not sure that's how transmission works.

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No.

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't need to understand science.

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This show clearly doesn't.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Can I hold your gun?

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's true.

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Like, that is literally a point I can't even fight you on.

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You know, despite all of our tripping.

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
There have been, like, a few cute moments of, like, you know,

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
they're kids and they're growing up and life sucks.

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I mean, this has been cringe, but still, like, okay so far.

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah.

191
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This is pretty wholesome.

192
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Also, I think I'm just less offended by teenage lesbians than art

193
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
because I've watched a shit ton of anime.

194
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And they're always teenage lesbians in that.

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Kibs.

196
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Of age in Canada is 16.

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah, okay.

198
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I mean, if that's the legal age, then you're fine.

199
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's how it is.

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
She's trying to make sure there's no lawbreakers here, okay?

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Not Losh.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Welcome to Canada.

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
How does this chick know what a fascist dickbag is?

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
She's been living in Fedra for most of her life.

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
They're not going to educate you on that.

206
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Especially if they actually are them.

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I mean, they probably have, like, dictionaries

208
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and they probably do teach to some degree.

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
History, maybe?

210
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't imagine Fedra's education would be too different

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
than American education.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Like, maybe it's more extreme and more patriotic

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and more authoritarian.

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But, like, I think they would still teach basic concepts.

215
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Maybe.

216
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I would imagine it is because fascist in this world

217
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
means exactly the same as it means in this world of ours.

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Asshole.

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Asshole.

220
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's what I have a mild disagreement with.

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You like, you know, cheese on your sandwich?

222
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, it's not provable.

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Fascist.

224
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Fascist.

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Ugh, fuck.

226
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let me put it like this.

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If you ask dread girls, define fascism,

228
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I doubt you'd get an answer.

229
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
She'd be like,

230
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
people that tell me what to do, fascist?

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So it's the Twitter version of fascism, then?

232
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Probably.

233
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Most writers don't do research.

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Sadly, in the modern era.

235
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Fascist dickbags!

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
She only has one line.

237
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I like how they're both fighting the shittiness

238
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
of the other's ideology, even though they both suck.

239
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Well, they're both screwed.

240
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's like, oh, they're starving their population.

241
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You mean rationing?

242
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Does it look like it's easy to get food in the universe?

243
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's a dumb question the seal could have broken.

244
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And that's not...

245
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That is a hole in the roof.

246
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Like, that is very clearly not a standard entrance.

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Like, if they had known about it, maybe they had sealed it off.

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I discovered a secret entrance, so it's not sealed.

249
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Ha ha! Fascist.

250
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Clearly the Fedra people were, you know,

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
just keeping it to themselves,

252
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
because they would waste all this precious space.

253
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So, it turns out when Fedra connected that block up to the grid,

254
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
this place got connected, too.

255
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Not that they know.

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, yeah. I mean, the entire mall

257
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
can almost control that much energy.

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Pay attention.

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We're gonna go through there, then turn right.

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm sure there are dozens of kilowatts.

261
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
We don't know where we're going.

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Fucking turn right, open the door,

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
tell me when you're there.

264
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So, this area is pretty much exactly how it was in the game.

265
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
When they broke into the mall,

266
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
it was the same hole in the ceiling in the same corner with the same stuff.

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Like, they remade the set.

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I will say that this show has been consistently good in doing that.

269
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Like, remaking locations exactly.

270
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That is nice.

271
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
If you're a soulless console peasant and you play this game, poor that is.

272
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Go play the PC version, Arch.

273
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah, you seem to be fine with that, you console scrub.

274
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Arch plays console games, by the way.

275
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh.

276
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Ah, yes, that's not gonna alert anybody when the fucking mall lights up.

277
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah, the fucking windows.

278
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
This will definitely be difficult to see from the outside.

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah, I don't think these people know how malls work.

280
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The guy at the federal power plant just sees the power usage spike.

281
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He's like, what the fuck?

282
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What the fuck?

283
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No way.

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Playing copyrighted music.

285
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I love this song.

286
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Of course you do. It's made by Norwegian.

287
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
When I was, like, very, very young, this was on the radio regularly,

288
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and now I'm like, oh my god, I'm so old.

289
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You know...

290
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, trust me, you do not want to end up like that Chinese guy that got stuck in the escalator.

291
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah, like, escalators are very dangerous, and this is the one that has been used in 20 years.

292
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yep. One of them gets caught, sucked in.

293
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's fine, Ellie is doing the thing that her face is getting blended up.

294
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's like, fuck, fuck.

295
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If you guys remember the video.

296
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What video was that?

297
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, it was just, like, a woman, like, after exiting an escalator, that metal plate gives out,

298
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and she basically got blended.

299
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh, fuck, yeah.

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And there was a kid that happened to have a kid, too.

301
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yeah.

302
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Oh my god.

303
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Is this the Edmonton Mall?

304
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I know they shot this in Canada.

305
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
No, no, they got an abandoned mall instead.

306
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
No, the Edmonton Mall is, um, the biggest mall in Canada.

307
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's fucking huge.

308
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And it's a pretty well-known Canadian spot.

309
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I swear to god, show.

310
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
If you show me Elliot Page in underwear in this fucking episode, I am going to scream.

311
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You're, like, three connections removed from Elliot Page right now, Arch.

312
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I just noticed.

313
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Her eyebrows all fucked up.

314
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's annoying me.

315
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's been like that the entire show?

316
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, but I've just noticed, and I really don't like it now.

317
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But that's literally Elliot's design.

318
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
They even pointed it out twice?

319
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yeah, she mentioned that there was some kind of fight at a 7-Eleven.

320
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I mean, I wonder what the guy in that generator room, like, at the federal power plant's like, what the fuck?

321
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You know this place is, like, eating up so much power.

322
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah, like, all the stores are turned on and shit.

323
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
This is a pretty cheap ride.

324
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The horses don't even go up and down.

325
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You know what's funny about this?

326
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is another procrastinating episode where we don't get to see any cool stuff happen.

327
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's been 26 minutes and absolutely nothing of relevance or interest has happened.

328
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm kind of bored.

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I think this is going to be another, um, another episode.

330
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You lost to some clickers getting their heads smashed.

331
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yeah, I want to see, like, Zambies and stuff.

332
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This is going to be another episode like the, uh, the gay libertarian romance episode

333
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
where we just stop for a minute and see flashbacks.

334
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Like, this season doesn't have that many fucking episodes.

335
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
We already wasted one doing that.

336
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Now we're doing it again.

337
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, so, to their credit, this is pretty much how it went in the game's DLC for Ellie's backstory.

338
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
They went into the mall, they dicked around.

339
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Now, there were enemies in the mall that they fought, but, like, the actual idea of it

340
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
being an extended date for two young women who don't know what their sexuality is.

341
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's the same story.

342
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I turned 17 next month. That's when you get your assignment.

343
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You know what Kwon gave me?

344
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Sewage detail.

345
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And I'm a proud woman, goddammit. I don't do sewage work. That's for men.

346
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Actually, you know what it is? It's the black Asian...

347
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Watch as somebody has to do it.

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's the black Asian racist, uh, war that's going to be happening in the future.

349
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's already happening right now.

350
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
No, don't make me touch the boobie.

351
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I do like this. So she didn't run away for ideological reasons or because they were fascist dickbags, but because she was asked to do a dirty job.

352
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Alright.

353
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I mean, someone has to do it.

354
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Understandable motivation.

355
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What do you mean, shovel of shit? That's... debasing. Disgraceful. More important than that.

356
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I mean, if this society's anything like real world, you get paid very well. And compensated well for doing a dirty job.

357
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's the thing, Kibbs. It's not like the real world. You don't get compensated well. You get compensated with you do it or you get shot.

358
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You know what? What you want to do...

359
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I like that. That's a win. You don't get shot.

360
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You got to look at the bright side of it. You can't be such a pessimist.

361
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
In a liberal capitalist society, these jobs get done because you get paid for them.

362
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
And if there's no one who wants to do them, then you have to offer more money.

363
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And the market kind of balances itself in a sense.

364
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
In an actual fascist society, they'll just point the guns at you and say, this is your work detail.

365
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But then again, so will a communist one, so...

366
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Same thing in the end.

367
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I mean, they are the same, yeah.

368
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
God, I hope the zombies eat them both alive.

369
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Patience.

370
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Are you cringing, Arch?

371
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What's wrong, Arch? You don't like this?

372
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
There we go.

373
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, fuck.

374
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah, the ink's kind of old, dude.

375
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
My dollar seems like a lot, though.

376
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Pretty stiff.

377
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Even for 2003, it was a lot, I think.

378
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It was like a dollar back then, I think.

379
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Awesome.

380
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah.

381
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

382
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Listen, the episode has redeemed itself.

383
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Because arcades were so much fun back in the day.

384
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You can still find arcades today.

385
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Man, I recall going to a hotel in like 2015 or something.

386
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And they had like some sort of atrium entertainment area, like down in the lobby.

387
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And there was like a path where you could see the pool, like the hotel's pool.

388
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So okay, there's a pool.

389
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
There was like a pool table.

390
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Okay, you could play a game of pool for a dollar or something.

391
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And then there was like two neglected arcade cabinets in the corner.

392
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And one of them was broken.

393
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And the other one was Ms. Pac-Man from a very long time ago.

394
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And I was like, Jesus, no one's played this in years, have they?

395
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Her pays are pretty cool.

396
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
There's still some around, though.

397
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Not in Canada. Rip.

398
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I think there's a place in Minnesota like Dave and Busters is what it's called.

399
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
popcorn from 52 years ago.

400
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Mortal Kombat!

401
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
My dinner's ruined.

402
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So Naomi, she's also watching this series, too.

403
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And she gave me this insight.

404
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Her theory as to why they changed the dates of the show to make it so that the apocalypse happened in 2003

405
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:42,000
and that this is now 2023 is that it made it much easier to get era-appropriate props

406
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
because everything that they would get that was era-appropriate would automatically be aged 20 years

407
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
because it is aged 20 years.

408
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So this Mortal Kombat 2 cabinet looks old because it probably is one of the originals.

409
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
They didn't have to recreate it, you know?

410
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm bored.

411
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Kibs, listen.

412
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
The only reason you're bored right now is because you're too young to enjoy Mortal Kombat.

413
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I said, damn, he got bored.

414
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Oh, I thought you said you're bored. Oh, sorry.

415
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm going to have to tell Vee that has this in the show. He'll be happy.

416
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
With my fetish.

417
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I forgot that that was Vee's fetish.

418
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Wait, what?

419
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
The old Vee lore.

420
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
This is a Vee lore item. Oh, I'm not familiar with it.

421
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Vee lore and vore.

422
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
He likes vore.

423
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Really?

424
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah.

425
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Eat up.

426
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
He had a fur sauna and everything at one point because it wasn't just wool.

427
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Oh, he still does.

428
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Uh oh, a clicker.

429
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Always a clicker. You're not going to show up?

430
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Is it time?

431
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Ooh, they're using the dollhouse for it. That's a pretty good one.

432
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Very spooky.

433
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
There he is.

434
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Now, remember how long that person has to have been here?

435
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah.

436
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
To become a full mushroom.

437
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So that means somebody actually waddled in here.

438
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yep.

439
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Man, I think what I would miss most in the post-apocalypse is the video games.

440
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I just love them too much.

441
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I mean, as long as you have electricity, you can still play, like, physical media games.

442
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Yeah.

443
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
On consoles and shit.

444
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
That's right.

445
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Arch, consoles would rule the day in the post-apocalypse.

446
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Luckily, the war with China won't lead to the apocalypse.

447
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It'll just lead to free and cheap labor.

448
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
That person just fucked up.

449
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Well, no, it's supposed to be volume 2 with a T.O.O.

450
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's a pun book.

451
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
All right, Dev, you're getting beaten too.

452
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Listen, my pun sense immediately fluted in.

453
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That's kind of terrible, Dev. I kind of hate you now.

454
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Isn't the clicker fucking moving faster?

455
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
What's wrong, Arch? Are you bored?

456
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
It's so loud.

457
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
It takes screenshots.

458
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Some of you have been out of Arch's pain.

459
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Not much, though.

460
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Watch those screenshots.

461
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:34,000
See, there's wholesome aspects to this, and there's cringe aspects to this, and they're kind of overlapping.

462
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm kind of enjoying it, but it's also kind of boring, yeah?

463
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Oh, shit.

464
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
The pipe bombs.

465
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Don't just...

466
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
It's just like, I don't mind a romance story, I guess.

467
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The villain fucking Ted thing was like, okay, I mean, decently done.

468
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But this is just two kids on a date? I'm not interested.

469
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Arch, were you never a kid on a date before?

470
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I have experienced this. I don't need to see it on television.

471
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Okay, you could make this interesting.

472
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Like, if you had two really interesting characters doing this stuff, you had a long relationship with both of them, and they had been flirting or whatever, this was the culmination, sure.

473
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But it isn't. I don't know who rat hair is. I barely know who Ellie is at this point.

474
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I think they have too many flashbacks. They're really relying on you knowing the game.

475
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yes, and I don't. I don't care.

476
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I mean, she's right about that. Ha, got him.

477
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
You join the communist revolutionaries and they're already ordering you around and making you go places.

478
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I need to fight for the revolution in some country or some city.

479
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
At least it's not Fedra who orders you to do things.

480
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You know, like, logistics and maintain the city.

481
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I like how she complains so much about being told to shovel shit, and now she's like, well, I'm told to go to Atlanta, I guess I'll just do it. It's like, okay.

482
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Oh no, now she's going to feel so bad when she's eaten by a zombie.

483
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Spirit Halloween!

484
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
That fucking zombie's taking a sweet ass time.

485
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Listen, Arch, he's been stuck there for a while. His legs are a little stiff.

486
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
He's going to work up that, you know, limber up a little.

487
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Arch, can't wait to see a black person die.

488
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I mean, it's true.

489
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Arch can't keep his hatred of them.

490
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I want to see the white person die too.

491
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's going to be that scene from American History X, but the guy kicking the black man is going to be a zombie with a mushroom head.

492
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Listen, I read Marx, okay? I get it. Power to the people or whatever.

493
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I watched RedTube, I know what's going on.

494
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Damn, they groomed her.

495
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That's what she just said.

496
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Yeah, pretty much.

497
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Yeah, his father.

498
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
They love-bombed me!

499
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Damn. Arch, make more whining sounds about how bad this is.

500
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Please.

501
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I am busy right now.

502
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm playing on my phone.

503
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
My shipgirl waifus need me more than this TV show does.

504
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I knew you were fucking slacking.

505
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Wait, what are you playing, Arch?

506
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Azur Lane.

507
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Fuck.

508
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,000
This reminds me of, like, some of those best of the worst episodes, I don't know, that are media, where Mike will look over and Rich will just be on his phone playing.

509
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I was like, you fucking cheater!

510
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You gotta watch this shit with us!

511
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, this is the scene.

512
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I remember this because they're going to get-

513
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah, if it's like the game, they're going to-

514
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yep, there's the masks.

515
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Okay, they're doing exactly like the game.

516
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
They get the masks, they run around with the masks, they get bit accidentally because they're being stupid with masks.

517
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Because they're dumb kids.

518
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, this is actually going to be the entire fucking episode.

519
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
It is. This is the episode.

520
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Listen, Ellie, we're almost of age.

521
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
We gotta learn how to dance on tables.

522
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Okay.

523
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Okay.

524
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
That was real easy to talk her out of it.

525
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Okay, you can die now. You've had your kissy thingy.

526
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Yep, here it comes.

527
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Revolutionary Lesbians in Late-Stage Capitalism.

528
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Oh, no.

529
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Have you guys actually played that?

530
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Let's not talk about that again.

531
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Focus on the fun.

532
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Damn, here's your shot.

533
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Everyone was bit.

534
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And we just don't realize it.

535
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Of course.

536
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Because the camera working intentionally didn't show anything.

537
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Yep.

538
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Oh, you know, 9mm bullets, not all that dangerous.

539
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
But a knife to the head, well...

540
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Holy shit!

541
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
She's not happy though, because she's dead.

542
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
You're gonna have to put her down, Ellie.

543
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Why are you smiling?

544
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Chomp.

545
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah.

546
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Just like with the whole Pablo Escobar, whatever his name was, getting stabbed.

547
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
That didn't happen. You didn't actually shoot that.

548
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
He didn't seem to get his mouth close enough to either of those body parts.

549
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
They didn't. They just pretended it happened.

550
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Oh wow, now we'll get the shocking revelation that she didn't actually leave anyway.

551
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Didn't you enjoy that flashback?

552
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
That was totally worth fucking 50 minutes of my existence.

553
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
She just stood there and remembered the whole story.

554
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And Joel's like, I'm dying, just either help me or leave.

555
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Hey, calm down Pablo, I'm reminiscing right here.

556
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I remember being a lesbian because of a DLC they released.

557
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Oh, by the way...

558
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So, I mentioned before, revolutionary lesbians in late stage capitalism.

559
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That's actually a game you can play. You can download that on Steam if you want.

560
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
No, I don't think I will.

561
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
It's not a very good game, I don't know if you can tell.

562
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
You know what, they just listened to the federal people. I think they both have lived.

563
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I think that's the message of the story.

564
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Or if they had swept the ball properly.

565
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Moral of the story is, fascism saves lives.

566
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
That's like the Warhammer 40k moral.

567
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Uh oh, that's a mmm.

568
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
If only you had listened to the Nazis keeping you safe, warm and fed.

569
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
The multi-racial, multi-cultural, LGBTQ plus approving Nazis.

570
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
They're very progressive, okay?

571
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Nazism has come a long way.

572
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I mean, if you could have Nick Fuentes in your ranks, you were gone for three hours.

573
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
What were you doing?

574
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
My mouse is getting a tiny bit dirty. I think I might have to go clean it or something.

575
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
You don't get to get out of this that easy, Blondie.

576
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Well, Joe, I mean, it's not bleeding at all.

577
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Actually, I don't think I need to stitch this.

578
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Fine, I don't know what you're being a big baby about.

579
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Unironically, this is nothing.

580
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Yeah, there's no blood coming out.

581
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That hurt.

582
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Yeah, no, you're just adding mania.

583
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Uh, that hurts.

584
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Yeah, no, there's no blood. The wound is dry, like...

585
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And you're sewing it with a needle you found in a fucking cupboard somewhere.

586
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
You're doing a horrible arselet.

587
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
There's probably cordyceps on it, fuck.

588
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So...

589
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
So, how did you enjoy flashback episode number two, guys?

590
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
That's really easy to put into words, Dev.

591
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah?

592
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'll be right back. I'm getting a piece of cloth to fucking watch my mouse.

593
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Far more important. And interesting.

594
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I guess Arch doesn't have anything to say about it.

595
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Well, to be fair, Arch didn't play the game.

596
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So, it is a different situation.

597
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
I actually played the DLC.

598
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So did I.

599
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But did you like the DLC? Because I didn't.

600
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It was okay. It wasn't as good as the main game.

601
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I felt like it was like, oh, by the way, Elia's for sure trans, and that's the DLC.

602
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Not trans, lesbian.

603
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Or lesbian. Whatever.

604
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Listen, names and stuff are hard, okay?

605
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You know, it could be lesbian. They might retcon that later.

606
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
But either way, she's lesbian.

607
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yes.

608
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
My memory, I'm old man memory now.

609
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
But, like, I just remember the DLC being kind of like,

610
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Ellie's a lesbian now. Wow, isn't that amazing?

611
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And it's like, I'm playing the DLC and I was like,

612
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
yeah, but like, this is kind of boring.

613
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Just like the DLC was.

614
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Because the DLC was just kind of boring, too.

615
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
It didn't really add anything fun.

616
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Yeah, I kind of agree. When it comes to the game,

617
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
the actual DLC itself wasn't, like,

618
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
the levels were just kind of samey and they didn't really do anything with them.

619
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And you only play as Ellie. There's no Joel.

620
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It's just Ellie because it's her flashback.

621
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And I think, like, it was one of the first instances of,

622
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
let's see if woke stuff sells.

623
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Let's sell a DLC where we're only selling the fact that

624
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Ellie is going to be confirmed a lesbian.

625
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And that's it.

626
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And they didn't really, like, they didn't put anything else that was fun in it.

627
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
For me, when I played it, that was kind of all I got out of it.

628
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I didn't really care at the time and I still don't.

629
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's like, OK, Ellie's a lesbian, but like,

630
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
at the end of the day, I want my money back because the experience of the DLC.

631
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Like, to be blunt, like, the DLC added a bunch of rehashed, like,

632
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
like what felt like rehashed recycled assets

633
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
for a couple of levels that just really didn't add anything.

634
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Yeah.

635
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And it was like at that point, by the time I'd beaten the game The Last of Us,

636
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I was already kind of bored of the gameplay loop.

637
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's like more of that just wasn't enough.

638
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I personally have mixed feelings about this episode because it,

639
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
in my opinion, it wasn't very interesting.

640
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It was a second and another flashback episode.

641
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
However, if you were a Last of Us purist,

642
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
a Last of Us mega fan, you know, and you wanted to...

643
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You probably already don't like the show, though.

644
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, if you're, no, no, if you're a purist,

645
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
you're going to want it to be exactly like the video game.

646
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Yeah, you're going to want the mushrooms back and the, you know,

647
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I agree with that. I agree with that.

648
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But, but, but here's the thing.

649
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
This, this episode, for better or worse,

650
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
was like the DLC that it's based on.

651
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
And someone who really is invested in these characters

652
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
and these stories in these games would probably like this episode

653
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
just because of that. It's like, okay, no, this is the story.

654
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It's properly adapted. Okay.

655
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Now you can not like the story looking at it from a non-fan's point of view,

656
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
like Arches and fair enough.

657
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But I think, I think you can't, you can't come at this one with like,

658
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Oh my God, they changed it and made it worse.

659
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You can't make that argument this time because it is accurate.

660
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Well, yeah. I mean, the only thing,

661
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
the only thing I saw like major lore break in this one

662
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
was the fact that when the zombie was going after Ellie,

663
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
you could see the little tentacles come out of its mouth for a second,

664
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
which is not canon. But beyond that, like the biting,

665
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
like the whole sequence, that's pretty on point.

666
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
The issue is, is like, even if you're a purist,

667
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I don't think purists will be watching at this point.

668
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
The purists would have already tuned out because it's,

669
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
it's not a pure, it's not a pure replica.

670
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
It's possible. How about you, Lilith? How'd you feel about this episode?

671
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I haven't played the DLC, but like in the time I did watch it,

672
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
it was like a very long time ago. So like,

673
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
it's kind of about the story beats I remember and like, you know,

674
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
they wanted to adopt the DLC into the story and that's fine.

675
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Like it gives the viewers who don't know the story or haven't played the game,

676
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
a bit of an insight into Ellie's backstory.

677
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Like some people might think it's unnecessary and like,

678
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
it doesn't feel like extremely pertinent to the story so far,

679
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
at least from what we've seen, like next episode might change her mind.

680
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Like her girlfriend might be important in shaping her character or something,

681
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
but like that remains to be seen.

682
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Well, I guess we'll just have to watch on, but if not,

683
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
then like other people have said, like it's,

684
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
it would be pretty pointless for the most part or at least padding,

685
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
some might say.

686
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yep. Yeah, it definitely feels like padding.

687
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And you know, if we count the other, the other flashback episode,

688
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
we've now had two episodes of padding out of seven episodes.

689
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And isn't there only nine episodes in this season?

690
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I mean, if they want to like self-contained like stories,

691
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
then just let that be an episode. I mean, that's fine.

692
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Like I don't have anything against that, but like,

693
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
like you said, there's like not that much, that many episodes left.

694
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I mean, they're taking a risk and you know what I'd rather they,

695
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
if they are going to get into it, I'd rather dedicate the time to do it.

696
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Right. Then to not do it at all, if they're going to do it anyways.

697
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So, yeah. And you know what, to this episode's credit,

698
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
it is more central to the story than,

699
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,000
than the Bill and Frank story because those characters don't come back again.

700
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah. And with this one, you could actually like,

701
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
it shows off how Ellie got bitten and found out that she's immune

702
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
and also goes a bit to her past, which is, you know, fine from a narrative perspective.

703
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Yeah, definitely. I think that's definitely a valid point because this episode,

704
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
unlike the Bill and Fred one. Oh God, I already forgot the other guy.

705
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It's Frank. It's Frank, you fucking homophobe, Kibbs.

706
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Kibbs, how can you be a self-hating homophobe, man?

707
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Wow. But this episode, yes.

708
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
This episode actually has far more plot relevance than Bill and Frank ever did.

709
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Because Bill and Frank was a side story that had nothing to do with the main characters

710
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and like they're dead and then they waddled away.

711
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Yep. And then they immediately lose Bill's truck, like the next episode.

712
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
So it's like, oh, well, okay.

713
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
That was the whole episode for a plot device, for a truck,

714
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
for a thing that we're going to use for like the first five minutes of this episode.

715
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And then just fucking gone.

716
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Arch, did you actually want to give your take on this episode or?

717
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I can, with great and everlasting eternal joy, inform you and everyone else that my mouse is now clean.

718
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I see. Okay.

719
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
All right, we can move on to the next one.

720
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So that was episode seven and now we have episode eight to talk about

721
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
or to watch and then talk about, I guess.

722
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
But first, real quick, I had this episode spoiled to me, the one that we just watched.

723
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Sorry, I knew it was coming. I didn't reveal it.

724
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I didn't want to break the magic of this amazing show for everyone.

725
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
But I knew that this was going to be the LEDLC lesbian romance.

726
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And then they get bit at the end episode.

727
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And the reason why I knew that is because of this article.

728
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Basically, do you recall how Ben Shapiro and some of the other like rightoid political pundits talked about how they shoehorned in gay men into The Last of Us with Bill and Frank, even though they were already gay?

729
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Right. Basically, the same type of complaint came out of, you know, rightoid YouTube channels about they they added more gay people to the last was how could they do this?

730
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And it's like, you guys, these people were always gay.

731
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And of course, that meant to, you know, more people on the left on Twitter making fun of them.

732
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And, you know, you everyone knows how this sort of news cycle works on the Internet nowadays, right?

733
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Someone gets outraged. The other side laughs and says they're ignorant.

734
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
And it's just it's just a constant echoing drama that just goes for forever.

735
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:42,000
All right. And so once it came out that people on the right were not happy with this episode and not because it was poorly written and poorly paced

736
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
and didn't really fit with the rest of the story and just wasn't you know, wasn't a very good episode all in all.

737
00:44:49,000 --> 00:45:05,000
But because it was lesbians, the actress who played Ellie's girlfriend, I forget her name, Riley Storm Reid, she said she isn't concerned with homophobic The Last of Us fans because we are telling important stories.

738
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
It's 2023. If you're concerned about who I love, then I need you to get your priorities straight.

739
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
It's current year, guys.

740
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I thought Stormy Reid was a porn actress.

741
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Yeah, yeah. Me, too. Isn't that a porn name?

742
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah, it's like, I mean, it's fair if she's upset that people are upset about this.

743
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Like, it is a pretty dumb thing to cry over.

744
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The objection to this exists on TV.

745
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly right. Like, you know, the objection to this to this episode isn't lesbians exist.

746
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,000
It is that it's a it's another flashback in a show that's already very slow and needs to have a bit more meat on the bone.

747
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
That's the objection. The lesbian part doesn't really matter that much.

748
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I know that I know our you're like making fun of him a bit, but it really doesn't matter.

749
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Like, but some people for we're just basically it's turned into another culture war thing.

750
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:08,000
The thing is, it's a bit of a derpy situation because there are a lot of I don't know if I'd call them right.

751
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:16,000
But there are people on YouTube who do entertainment commentary stuff for pop culture commentary along the lines of what I do.

752
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But a lot of them do pretend that they know what they're talking about.

753
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And so they go like, oh, they put they put gays in this because they realize that's a that's a talking point, right?

754
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
You don't like forced woke ism gays woke. Right. So therefore it's bad.

755
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
But if you actually did some research, you realize, you know, they were always gay.

756
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:43,000
There's been held the last of us. I don't bother covering this specifically on news about it because one, I don't know about it.

757
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Two, I don't care about it. And three, as far as I'm concerned, it's a woke is property already.

758
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
So I'm like, oh, you know, woke thing.

759
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:58,000
But I see because that's the thing. I don't mind there being gays and TV show.

760
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I applauded the the Bill and Ted romance with the caveat, so long as it didn't screw over the rest of the show, which in part it does.

761
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And now there's a second filler episode and I'm kind of just sitting here like, wow, this is getting very boring.

762
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
That's my contention with it. But yes, a lot of people do.

763
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
They try to jump on the bandwagon that frankly passed a year or two ago.

764
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Yeah, yeah, I think so. Like, no, no offense to guys like the quartering, but his his whole thing seems to have hit its peak a little bit ago.

765
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And now it's kind of like on its way down in terms of what's popular on YouTube, you know, and also just Jeremy say this.

766
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Now, it sounds like I'm starting drama.

767
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
He had no idea. Wow.

768
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Arch spoke the truth and arch versus Jeremy. I mean, this was bound to happen, though.

769
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I have I have unironically seen this because because it is the thing, right?

770
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Because the left did this to say they've always been woke.

771
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
That was always been woke. No, it hasn't. It's literally the same knee jerk reaction thing.

772
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Was it the oh, God, there was a show a little while ago.

773
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I can't there was one show or was it a game with everyone on like our side, quote unquote, said it was going to be awful.

774
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And it turned out it was actually pretty OK. And everyone was kind of coping about it.

775
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
What was that? That sounds it does sound familiar. It wasn't Hogwarts.

776
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
It was before that. It was a game. I think it was a game.

777
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I think it was a game. Yeah, it might have been a game because I remember everyone's like, oh, no, no movie, movie Avatar, The Way of Goddamn Water.

778
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
That was it. I didn't see that. Was it actually good?

779
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I don't know. I'm Cindy there. But I remember that everyone's talking about like, yeah, this is going to bomb.

780
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
This is going to be awful. Like he's talking about toxic masculinity is going to be terrible.

781
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And I didn't comment on it at all because I hadn't seen anything of it.

782
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And if I don't know anything about a thing, I'll probably usually just be like, yeah, that doesn't sound good.

783
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
But there wasn't anything about toxic masculinity in the movie, though.

784
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:12,000
No, I don't think. Oh, yeah. But the director had said so specifically that he wanted to fight toxic masculinity and he didn't want guns and et cetera.

785
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Fuck. Also, the the pregnant female Navi warrior.

786
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
But by and large, the movie turned out to be OK.

787
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And it's like, OK, so that reminds me of like pregnant Spider-Man who's like swinging around on.

788
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I was like, it looks ridiculous. Fuck.

789
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
But the way of water ended up being enormous economic success. So a lot of people were kind of coping about it.

790
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And I get it. But like you do have to it is, again, that idea that we are on the defensive all the time.

791
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
If you're on the defensive, you have to try and cancel things. You have to protect yourself against those things by attacking them.

792
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:00,000
We're not there anymore. We are genuinely in a position where we can we can be offensive.

793
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Yes. Yeah. Anyway, you know, we don't have to be on the defensive.

794
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,000
If way of water turns out to be good. Great. If Hogwarts turns out to be good. Fantastic.

795
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,000
If it turns out to be shit. Well, I'm bastard then, too. Yeah. Yeah, I completely agree.

796
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I was on E-FAP yesterday when we were talking about Atomic Heart.

797
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:30,000
And I made the point that I really enjoyed the the over sexualized fridge girlfriend where she liked her.

798
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I fucking I hated the fact that they moved away from her. Like occasionally you would just get generic voice.

799
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I'm like, oh, fridge waifu. I know, Kibbs, you've played it a little.

800
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Did you play it on the card? Yeah, I watched some gameplays of it. Yeah.

801
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
OK, so so there's there's the one fridge that you buy your items and stuff from or you upgrade your stuff at.

802
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And it has the A.I. it's like a horny, super horny robot. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

803
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So people were saying that, like, it was problematic and it was sexist.

804
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And I was just like, listen, I like this. Yeah, I like this, even though it was kind of over the top and cringe sometimes.

805
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Because because it's. Yes. Yeah. But but here's the thing.

806
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It's because it's something that a woke developer wouldn't do and that they would they would in fact be very angry if it came out and it did come out.

807
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And it's like, oh, this is actually a breath of fresh air. People who don't care about about appearing a certain way in public.

808
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
They just say, we'll just we'll just put sexy robots in the game. Fuck it.

809
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:39,000
We'll just put like like I mean, I saw one Twitter streamer like turned the game off because because the main character called a robot a gear head.

810
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And she said that she didn't want to promote slurs against robots. Anyway, this is this is way off topic.

811
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I guess the point the point that I was getting at is that it was refreshing for how flawed atomic art was.

812
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It was refreshing to see some of those things that woke creators, woke artists, woke people who make TV shows or games or movies or whatever.

813
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
They wouldn't do that stuff. And it was refreshing to see it again.

814
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:12,000
In terms of The Last of Us, this this this is a more, as you say, are two more woke property.

815
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
But at least the show is, to its credit, at least somewhat accurate. That's nice.

816
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
But yeah, I'm not I'm not at this point in the show, I'm not expecting anything great.

817
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So I've got episode about episode eight here.

818
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Episode eight is the second to last episode of the season. For some reason, it's a nine episode season, I think, which is kind of strange.

819
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Lucky me.

820
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
A show made for the fans at least has that going for it.

821
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
You know, at least it's made for the people who are supposed to enjoy it.

822
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I've noticed that they've completely stopped with that.

823
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
How the virus or how the mushroom started series of flashbacks.

824
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It would have been nice if they had one of those every episode.

825
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
You know, God, no, we don't need any more.

826
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I would have enjoyed like little hints of the before times before every episode, as long as it was relevant to the episode.

827
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
That's just the problem is, is we've mucked around for two whole episodes.

828
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I want to just Joel and Ellie do Joel and Ellie stuff.

829
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It's a simple request.

830
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I want to see more Joel and Ellie.

831
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,000
They've replaced little flashbacks with full episodes of flashbacks.

832
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Yeah, they're not little anymore, Dev. They're not little anymore.

833
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I can't wait till we get like flashbacks inside of flashbacks.

834
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Hey, we're not at that point yet. I don't think there's enough episodes for that.

835
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Executive director Neil Druckleman.

836
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Fucking Druckleman, dude.

837
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
He's like, bro, I'm going to ruin this franchise.

838
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It's like, OK, fair enough. I mean, I can't really call you there, dude.

839
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
You do you.

840
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
You own it.

841
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
That's true.

842
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Your toy. You want to break it? Go for it.

843
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Joel and Ellie, please.

844
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Hey, this is like an average Canadian town.

845
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth.

846
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.

847
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
This actually looks like like my town, my hometown.

848
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Jesus saying, behold, the tabernacle God is with men.

849
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

850
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Crazy Catholics.

851
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Oh, is this going to be like the winter cultists?

852
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:44,000
This was a part of the game.

853
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Is this the religion is bad portion of this video game?

854
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I think so. They find a cult at some point and Joel kills them all because, of course, it's a video game.

855
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:08,000
I love killing cults in video games like doing like the Boomer cannibal cult.

856
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Side story in GTA five and ending up killing them all as Trevor was really fun.

857
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
It's kind of cold.

858
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
You got to wait for the ground is too cold to dig.

859
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Yeah, I will bury your father in the spring.

860
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,000
That's how it is here, man. I'm sure that's how it is in Norway, too.

861
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Well, then we have advanced technology called digging machines.

862
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
OK, we have those here, too, and in bigger cities, they do that.

863
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
But like in my hometown, they just had like a hut.

864
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
They put the bodies in and to wait until spring and it would be cold enough to keep them in there.

865
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:05,000
You go in there, Bob. We don't have the technology to bury you yet.

866
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:12,000
It always triggers me when people are in cold environments like this and their front is entirely open.

867
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Now go get it. We're going home. You guys should be wearing toques or something.

868
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Like at least zip up your jacket like they put it. No, put on your hood.

869
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Put on your hood, Nick. Don't worry, Joe.

870
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I'm going to go hunt the deer. I don't know how to dress it or what parts they eat or anything like that.

871
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
But I'm going to hunt the deer. I mean, it's fine. And in survival situation, you don't know how to do that.

872
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,000
You might as well fucking try. I can barely use this fucking gun.

873
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,000
You're barely twice your size.

874
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Fire it like that underarm. It'll be a good way to get rid of that scope.

875
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,000
My favorite is when you see people who have the butt of the gun over their shoulder.

876
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
And that's my favorite. So it's facing downward.

877
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,000
No, no. So you've got the actual like butt of the gun, but they put it on top of their shoulder.

878
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Oh, my God. Yeah. Jesus. You know, if you shoot that rabbit with that, you're going to have very little rabbit.

879
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Yeah. You're going to have a good, fluffy hole, though.

880
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Oh, and that gun just went off.

881
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I think in the game, Ellie was using a bow by now.

882
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I guess they didn't want to level her up that way. You have to teach the actress how to use a bow.

883
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Yeah. You also need the arm strength because those aren't easy.

884
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Actually, I think the person who plays Ellie came out as non-binary.

885
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Like in real life. That kind of makes sense, though. So does that mean?

886
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
What's the gender neutral term for an actor? It's not actress.

887
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
It's Jesus objects.

888
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
What do you want from the actor? I think after itself is a gender neutral.

889
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Yes, I don't think it is. It might be. Yeah, I prefer it.

890
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Jesus. Oh, you did it.

891
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Well, quote close. I mean, I'm surprised that she actually got the shot off is what I mean.

892
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
People are jerking triggers bleed out.

893
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Well, actually, there's a fascinating little thing that happens when it's nice and cold outside.

894
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,000
The blood after a while will actually begin to freeze and clog up the wound.

895
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Yep. Really nasty.

896
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Quickly, whoever shot, it's probably nearby.

897
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I don't know where they're going to go.

898
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Oh, you can't drag this back on your own.

899
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
We're not a charity. We we can trade you for some of the deer we have.

900
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
What do you need? We have boots, medicine.

901
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Like for infections. We do back in our village.

902
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
You're welcome to follow us. I'm not following. Let's ride over there.

903
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Wait, where's your fingers? You have a trigger discipline? No, no, no.

904
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
For a second, there was like, oh, my God, they actually told her about trigger discipline.

905
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Now she's wearing her gloves to Padres living dangerously right about now.

906
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,000
That's your dad's gun. You're the one that's sick.

907
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:55,000
That's why you're out here on your own. Well, look, it's a four mile round trip back to our settlement.

908
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
It's going to be a while before James gets back. I have some oil and matches in my pack.

909
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Take shelter. Start a fire.

910
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I'd suggest you start dressing that deer because, you know, it's cold outside.

911
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:18,000
You know, I know how this turns out, so I can't exactly blame her.

912
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,000
But they're religious and post apocalypse dev. They're evil, obviously.

913
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Yes, obviously, obviously. But he's been nothing but friendly this whole time.

914
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I honestly mean, you know, I feel like this is probably an overreaction from L.A.

915
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And for what it's worth, it will be proven not to be. But still, like right now, it's true.

916
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
There's a reason to be cautious here. It is post apocalypse.

917
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:46,000
What hostile people have they met? So they ran into the communist commune and they were not very friendly.

918
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Wasn't my choice. They ran into Tommy's group and his mock Mongolians and they were friendly.

919
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
So I guess she's 50 50ing it a bit, but better to be safe than sorry.

920
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Yeah. Well, you sort of kind of got me there. I am a preacher, but just pretty standard Bible stuff.

921
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,000
What the whole world ended and you still believe that shit.

922
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I actually started believing after the world ended. Found God after the apocalypse.

923
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Oh, God, why? That's how I ended up with our flock. Sometimes people find God.

924
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I imagine God is just like in the fridge and it's like, God, why?

925
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
And he just turns around like, oh, shit, I wasn't paying attention. What happened?

926
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:34,000
And as we wanted, we picked up from stick in his mouth. Turns out he was murdered by this crazy man.

927
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And get this. That crazy man was traveling with a little girl.

928
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:52,000
At the same group. Did you bring the medicine? Yeah, but throw it to her. David.

929
01:01:53,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Makes me wonder, though, if they've got rifles aplenty, handguns, why they didn't send any of that with the pilfering party.

930
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:10,000
But, yeah, the story demanded they be poorly armed, I guess those four guys attacked Joel first.

931
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Right. Yeah, because they had their backs turned. Yeah. Yep. They charged him.

932
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Do you know how this works, Ellie? Joel, where the fuck do I put this?

933
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I don't know. He's allergic to penicillin.

934
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I'll just stick it right here. That'll work. Right there. All the way in.

935
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Just pump it straight into his internal organs. Good.

936
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I knew she'd been better off either coating the wound or putting it in their arm, but hey, details, it works.

937
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,000
You know, I'm just happy we're back on with the story. Yes.

938
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
And that it is, you know, more or less what the game was again.

939
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I know I'm like a broken record on that, but it's refreshing to see.

940
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It's a story. It has characters. I even know some of them.

941
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Lilith and Kibs, how much do you two remember about the religious cultists in this game?

942
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I don't remember nothing at this point. No? Were they cannibals?

943
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I remember the ending. I don't think these were the cannibals. I don't think.

944
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
What is it?

945
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Are you sure? Maybe they are the cannibals.

946
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:47,000
What do you think that guy was? They just got a deer, so I don't see why they'd eat each other right now.

947
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
We could eat the deer, or Bob.

948
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Oh, well, that one father just died, remember?

949
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Yep. I know, but again...

950
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
No, because here's the deer. Here's the deer.

951
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Ah. So these are the cannibals. Maybe it is, Bob.

952
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Yeah.

953
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
To be fair, if you're starving and you have a dead body...

954
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Yeah.

955
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I can see the argument. It is, however, what we call a long-term health risk.

956
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And avoid the brain stems.

957
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Yes. We found a girl who was with the man who took Alec from us.

958
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
How did he hear a rumor when he just got back?

959
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I don't know.

960
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
When the sun rises, I'll lead a group out to pick up her trail.

961
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Well, the other dude did come back for a moment, I guess, maybe?

962
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Or...

963
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Because he did get the penicillin.

964
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
And we'll bring that man to justice.

965
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
You should kill him. You should kill both of them.

966
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Ugh.

967
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Women. Always so bloodthirsty.

968
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Jesus.

969
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Now you know where the back is.

970
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
The Lord speaketh of the back of his hand.

971
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
I'm sorry I had to hit you, child, but we had to establish that we were actually the bad guys.

972
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Now go on and eat your own dad.

973
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
It's in the soup.

974
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Uh-huh. Your father is soup.

975
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Thank you.

976
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
What do you mean you don't have a dad anymore? He's right here, points to Platter.

977
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Blesseth with Christ, the living bread.

978
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Amen.

979
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Yes, he withal eating the body of Christ, I think.

980
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Yep.

981
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
And the way that they're just focusing on the food, yeah, this is the cannibals, okay.

982
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Making it gross.

983
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Bob was delicious.

984
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I mean, I can understand a desperate situation, but it sucks.

985
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Well, it's the thing. If they ate him because they were out of food, then fair enough.

986
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Yeah, they didn't just, like, kill a random person. He was already dead.

987
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Waste that whatnot.

988
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Mm-hmm.

989
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
If they eat random people for fists and giggles, however, it'll be different.

990
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I'll inject it right there again. It'll be okay. Ah, fuck.

991
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
That's not how this works, Ellie?

992
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
That is not how that works, no.

993
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
But she's filling up his stomach cavity with lots of penicillin.

994
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
To be fair, you know, it'll be absorbed through the skin eventually.

995
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Ellie got there.

996
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Dude, eat your horse at this point. You're gonna be camped out here for a while.

997
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Ellie doesn't know how to brush her tracks in the snow.

998
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Wait, wait, wait. You can't feed a horse snow. You can't eat snow yourself.

999
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Well, you can. I wouldn't recommend it in the long run, but again, if you're desperate.

1000
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,000
You have to let the snow melt into water first before you drink it.

1001
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Like, it's not gonna hydrate you like that,

1002
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
because the amount of energy that your body uses up to melt it.

1003
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I don't know what kind of snow you have, Dev.

1004
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
There's something about snow causing dehydration long-term.

1005
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Long-term probably is.

1006
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Now, if you were smart, you'd boil it first, because, uh,

1007
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
well, there are many wonderful things that live in snow.

1008
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Ah, yes.

1009
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
We're a stealthy hunting party, hunting a dangerous man who kills one of us,

1010
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
which is why we're walking in the middle of the fucking streets.

1011
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Daylight.

1012
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
You wouldn't want to be sneaky or anything. That'd be stupid.

1013
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Just another mouth to feed, or another hole to breed.

1014
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Jesus.

1015
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I couldn't resist. It was too good. It rhymed and everything.

1016
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Down here, you fucking kill them. You got it?

1017
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Joel.

1018
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Joel, do not fall asleep.

1019
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
He's like, bro, I hurt. Am I everything hurts?

1020
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Also, I'm going to say, oh god.

1021
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Well, if they didn't know I was here before, that'll do it.

1022
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Yep.

1023
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Come on.

1024
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I mean, has the horse been eating?

1025
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Uh, no.

1026
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
To be fair, I like...

1027
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Must have packed horse food. Feed.

1028
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Listen, this is fake Hollywood snows.

1029
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
There's probably some grass for it to munch somewhere.

1030
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
It's like bushes inside.

1031
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Fuckers!

1032
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Ancient Mongolian horse gunnery.

1033
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Keep cutting fuckers.

1034
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Yep.

1035
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Now they can eat the horse.

1036
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
They've solved the food situation.

1037
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Yeah, didn't this guy want Ellie to, like, be his underage wife or something?

1038
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I think that might have... I can't remember.

1039
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It's been too long since I played the game.

1040
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Damn, that's kind of creepy, though.

1041
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
It sounds like something that's going on, though, doesn't it?

1042
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Of course.

1043
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
The rest of you, stay here, go door to door.

1044
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
You so hungry for vengeance?

1045
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Deliver it.

1046
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Jesus.

1047
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
They got a creepy looking guy to play this part.

1048
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Wow, just because he's ginger deaf, wow, a little bit of racism.

1049
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Well, at least he plays the creepy look well, I guess.

1050
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
He has...

1051
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Soulless eyes, is that what you're going for, Dev? Jesus.

1052
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
God damn it!

1053
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Get your knife ready.

1054
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Man, Ellie should have at least, like, dragged him underneath the stairs or something.

1055
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I have no senses. Ice approaching.

1056
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Hmm, a bloody mattress. I should continue.

1057
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
I should definitely not call with my friends, since this is definitely not where he is.

1058
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
He wants to kill, though.

1059
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Also, that beard, you deserve this.

1060
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Now you have more people to eat.

1061
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Hungry.

1062
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Why do you think he sent them on their little vengeance quest?

1063
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
He's racking up food.

1064
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
This is quite, uh, quite slow.

1065
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Joel can barely fucking do it.

1066
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
Jesus.

1067
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Good job, man, who couldn't move five seconds ago.

1068
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
He probably fucked up his stitches, though.

1069
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Stitches?

1070
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
The stitches.

1071
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Alright, she did...

1072
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Well, did she even have threads, though?

1073
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
She's just stabbing him for just some giggles.

1074
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Oh my god, bro.

1075
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
No, she found threads. She found threads in the last episode.

1076
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
You're too busy cleaning your mouse.

1077
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
He was so busy playing his phone game that he didn't even watch the other episode.

1078
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I mean, I don't even blame him.

1079
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
At the end of the flashback, she found a thread.

1080
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Oh god, this is going to get weird, isn't it?

1081
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Yeah.

1082
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
I think this is the...

1083
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
The veterinarian's place in town.

1084
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
They really make it look like the place in the game.

1085
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Oh, hey.

1086
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I just realized.

1087
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I was prophetic.

1088
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Another mouse to feed, another hole to breathe.

1089
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I called it.

1090
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Hey, listen to me.

1091
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
It's okay, he's just setting up one of those Deep South child beauty pageants.

1092
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
That's what he wants her for.

1093
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Timothy.

1094
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Oh, so long as there's nothing weird, I guess.

1095
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I like how they actually split up.

1096
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
These guys deserve what's coming.

1097
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Yeah.

1098
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Timothy.

1099
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Well, can I park with him?

1100
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
It's always a good idea to split up and to cover my ground, okay?

1101
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I like how Joel's just killing them all.

1102
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
He's barely conscious and he's like, nope.

1103
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,000
My non-toxic masculinity will pull me through this.

1104
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I'm going to kill all these misogynists.

1105
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I don't know any girl.

1106
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Oh, Jesus!

1107
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Michael.

1108
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
He can't help you.

1109
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
You focus right here or I'll pop your fucking kneecap off.

1110
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Jesus.

1111
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I think this was in the game, right?

1112
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Yeah.

1113
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Just interrogating them.

1114
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Yeah, this is from the game.

1115
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Interrogating to me.

1116
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Oh, the town.

1117
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
What town?

1118
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Cooper Lane.

1119
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
You got to get directions out of him?

1120
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Oh, no.

1121
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
He knows we're civil, I guess.

1122
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
We got a map.

1123
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Jesus Christ.

1124
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Non-toxic masculinity.

1125
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,000
It's okay.

1126
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I believe him.

1127
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Jesus.

1128
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Yeah, that's pretty much how it went in the game.

1129
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
You just got to inject it right in there, Arch.

1130
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Here, have some people soup.

1131
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Or me.

1132
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Just in case it wasn't obvious enough.

1133
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
That's for the brain dead of yours.

1134
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
For what it's worth, this is just dear meat, I swear.

1135
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
You're going to chop me up into little pieces.

1136
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
If you want to judge me.

1137
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Judge you?

1138
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
You're eating people, you sick fuck!

1139
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
It was a last resort.

1140
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
You think it doesn't shame me?

1141
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
But what was I supposed to do?

1142
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Let them starve?

1143
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
These people who put their lives in my hands?

1144
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Who expect me to keep them safe?

1145
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Who love me?

1146
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Yeah, maybe.

1147
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I don't know if I agree with Ellie here.

1148
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
No, that's a retarded position.

1149
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
I'm like, yeah, you should just all have died.

1150
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Why?

1151
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
You remind me of me.

1152
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
You're a natural leader.

1153
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,000
You're smart.

1154
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Loyal.

1155
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Violent.

1156
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Violent.

1157
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Wow.

1158
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
You read a lot of that script off screen, didn't you?

1159
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
You have a violent heart.

1160
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
And I should know.

1161
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
I'm a little bit of a user myself, actually.

1162
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
They need God.

1163
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
They need heaven.

1164
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
They need...

1165
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
They need a father.

1166
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
You don't.

1167
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
You're beyond that.

1168
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
You are fatherless.

1169
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I'm surrounded by sheep.

1170
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Fatherless behavior.

1171
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Damn, he bonded hard over this chick.

1172
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
You met, like, five minutes.

1173
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Like I said, loyal.

1174
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Yeah.

1175
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
He just wants to bone her.

1176
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
That's what this is.

1177
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I can tell the others to stop looking for him.

1178
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
The script says I have a weird attraction to young girls.

1179
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Well, better roll with it.

1180
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Really?

1181
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
They're paying me.

1182
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I just let him go?

1183
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Yes.

1184
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
If he leaves us in peace, they will just let him go.

1185
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Well...

1186
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
They do what I tell them to do.

1187
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
That bridge is already burnt.

1188
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I can't get what they're doing here, but Jesus Christ, he's...

1189
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
This is some love at first sight level shit here.

1190
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Like, I've always wooed you.

1191
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
We can be man and wife.

1192
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
We can lead this group of crazy people together.

1193
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
We grow.

1194
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Spread out.

1195
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
And we do whatever we need.

1196
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
A little bit of zero to sixty, but alright.

1197
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I think it works this time, because he's just clearly nuts.

1198
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I suppose, but like, the only thing he's doing that's nuts is this.

1199
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Like, the other decisions have been fairly irrational.

1200
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
The nuts part is just that he's like, alright, kiddie, yes.

1201
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
This is a deep south marriage, guys.

1202
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Like, the very first scene...

1203
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Oh!

1204
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Oh, God!

1205
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Yep, he was thinking with his dick.

1206
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
That's grody.

1207
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
He deserved that.

1208
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
You little cunt.

1209
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Let's see what I go tell the others now.

1210
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Ellie.

1211
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
What?

1212
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
What?

1213
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Tell them that Ellie is a little girl who broke her fucking finger!

1214
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
How did you put it?

1215
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Tiny little pieces?

1216
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
That's funny.

1217
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
You say, well, where?

1218
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
We chopped up our pieces.

1219
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Most unfortunate.

1220
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Damn.

1221
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
You see, I wouldn't have done what she did.

1222
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I would have pretended to play along for a while.

1223
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,000
You would have become, like, the priest's concubine until you could escape?

1224
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
I could just, like, stab him.

1225
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
In the middle of the night?

1226
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
While he's sleeping.

1227
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Yeah.

1228
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And get away.

1229
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,000
The thing is, you can just also wait until he buys it, and then you sneak out.

1230
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Oh, okay.

1231
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Yeah, at the very least, wait until he unlocks the cell door.

1232
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Yeah.

1233
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
This was, in my opinion, the most unbelievable part of the game.

1234
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Because Joel is still fucked up.

1235
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Like, from his wound.

1236
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
He has a murder rampage.

1237
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
He just murders fucking everyone.

1238
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
It's like, alright, alright, dude.

1239
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
That's a bit too video game for me.

1240
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:48,000
He had a bleeding, septic, fucking stomach wound about an hour ago.

1241
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Yeah.

1242
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Mark, you got better, okay?

1243
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
And Joe Allen.

1244
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
The story kind of demands that he be a little bit more effective.

1245
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
He pressed the heal button, Arch.

1246
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Clearly, you don't know anything.

1247
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
He found one of the healing packs.

1248
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
He held down the X button.

1249
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
He's invoking, as I said, his non-toxic masculinity.

1250
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Listen, I found a health pack. I'm good.

1251
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
There's the horse.

1252
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I guess they'll eat that later.

1253
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
You really should leave that outside, actually, in these circumstances.

1254
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
It'll freeze better.

1255
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And there's the people that they're eating.

1256
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
It's ganger ape time.

1257
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Fun for all the family.

1258
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
What?

1259
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Oh, no, they're just gonna eat her.

1260
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Well, I suppose that's merciful.

1261
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Don't do it! Please, don't do it! Please, don't!

1262
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
You had your chance!

1263
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Don't! I'm infected!

1264
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I'm infected.

1265
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And now so are you.

1266
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Roll up my sleeve. Look at it.

1267
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Look at it!

1268
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
It's part of your hair.

1269
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
What did you say?

1270
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Everything happens for a reason, right?

1271
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I wonder if she can infect people.

1272
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Oh, shit!

1273
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Ooh, damn!

1274
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
That looks pretty real to me, too.

1275
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
That was pretty impressive.

1276
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Not only did they let her do that, but he missed a series of point-blank shots.

1277
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Good job, both of you.

1278
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I mean, we've kind of established he's a Pascafist.

1279
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
He's not very good at gun.

1280
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
It's gun stat, super low.

1281
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
It's charisma stat, also low.

1282
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Unseriously removes it.

1283
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Aw, more food for later.

1284
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Oh my god, burn him.

1285
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Lul, that'd be so funny.

1286
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Burn his dick.

1287
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Oh, no, that's a video game torch.

1288
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Yep, that's gonna catch.

1289
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Awfully quick.

1290
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Yep, there it goes.

1291
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Yeah, don't even bother trying to put that out.

1292
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
That's a video game torch, my dude.

1293
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
It's gonna burn.

1294
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I do love how he doesn't even try.

1295
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,000
He doesn't say anything.

1296
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
He doesn't call for help.

1297
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Like, bye!

1298
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Damn.

1299
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,000
It's a boss fight, Arch.

1300
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
It's a video game.

1301
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And he realizes this.

1302
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
I'm the boss in a video game.

1303
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
This is ambiance.

1304
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Holy shit, it's overbur-

1305
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Wow, the fucking beeps are-

1306
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Listen, they doused it in gasoline before they started living here.

1307
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Part of the ritual, okay?

1308
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I actually really like that they're doing this.

1309
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Because you did have to basically take this guy on with no weapons as Ellie.

1310
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Or are you just that fucking special?

1311
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
No one likes being humiliated, Ellie.

1312
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
You don't know how good I am!

1313
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,000
That's not true.

1314
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Some people have that as a fetish.

1315
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
You don't know what I could have given you!

1316
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
This guy's the ultimate nice guy!

1317
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
He's like, I'm super simpy!

1318
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I'm gonna miss you.

1319
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Ellie...

1320
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Hold it down, you trust me.

1321
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
You whispered her name in a very creepy fashion.

1322
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Fuck!

1323
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Yeah.

1324
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Yeah.

1325
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Resistance only makes me harder.

1326
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Go, go, run!

1327
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Oh no.

1328
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I think it's weird.

1329
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Ha! Told you.

1330
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Oh no.

1331
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Oh man.

1332
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
There's no fear in love.

1333
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
You're gonna fucking hit him.

1334
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Please.

1335
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
I love how this guy...

1336
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Like, the entire building is on fire.

1337
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Like, he's fighting a chick with a big cleaver.

1338
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
And all I can think of is like, hmm, he'd be hard.

1339
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Ha ha ha ha!

1340
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Yes, yes, we got it.

1341
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
We get it.

1342
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
He was a bad person.

1343
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Show me the body.

1344
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Now I don't require too much makeup.

1345
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Makeup?

1346
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
It would require them to make, like, a prop.

1347
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Because there wouldn't be much of that face left.

1348
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
It was a nice play.

1349
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Bit too expensive.

1350
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
See, that was such a missed opportunity.

1351
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Get off of me!

1352
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Get off of me!

1353
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Get off of me!

1354
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Yeah, that's a good question.

1355
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Where is everyone else?

1356
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
The whole town's just...

1357
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Joel's the guy that killed them all.

1358
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,000
I'm fine now, by the way.

1359
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Yeah.

1360
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Yep, I'm good.

1361
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Thank you for that penicillin injection into my stomach.

1362
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
It really helped my heart.

1363
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Even though I just killed this entire town, we're not gonna loot it or anything.

1364
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
We're not gonna take a vehicle or any of their food.

1365
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,000
We're just gonna go.

1366
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Their food, their weapons, their fuel.

1367
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Or use some shelter to rest after all this, you know, stuff.

1368
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I'll be too big for her.

1369
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I don't think we would like to take their food.

1370
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I think there's a deer and a dead horse there.

1371
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Yeah, we can use that.

1372
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,000
The deer's used up, but the horse is good.

1373
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Oh.

1374
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Wait.

1375
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
That ended real quick.

1376
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
That was an hour, Dev.

1377
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,000
That's a long time, you little shite.

1378
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Yeah, but this time something actually happens.

1379
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I know.

1380
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
So it went faster because it was kind of fun.

1381
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
There was violence.

1382
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,000
There was murdering.

1383
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
There was a bit of creepy stuff.

1384
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
A girl almost got raped.

1385
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I just noticed something.

1386
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Didn't like that part.

1387
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I just noticed something.

1388
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
So the credits said Troy Baker.

1389
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
This guy is Troy Baker, I think.

1390
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
His right-handed man throughout the episode.

1391
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:15,000
And Troy Baker is actually a bit of a nod to the fans because he was the voice actor for Joel.

1392
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Damn.

1393
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:24,000
They apparently grabbed a bunch of the voice actors from the game and just gave them small roles scattered throughout the season.

1394
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:32,000
So instead of doing what the Dead Space remake did, where they made the main characters actually just take on the roles of the people,

1395
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:38,000
they replaced them with more prominent actors and had them play second fiddle in their own series.

1396
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Yes.

1397
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Damn.

1398
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
A bit of an F.U.

1399
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,000
A bit of an F.U.

1400
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
I mean, it was nice of them to include them at all, but yes.

1401
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
At least they included them, but like as a side character.

1402
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,000
It's a middle finger with a little bit of, you know, a little bit of goodness on it, too.

1403
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Yeah.

1404
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
A little bit of good.

1405
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
A little bit of bitter.

1406
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:07,000
So this episode was very much like the part of the game that it was covering.

1407
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
The characters were pretty much spot on.

1408
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
The locations were pretty much spot on.

1409
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:17,000
The fact that the town is now suddenly empty and no one else came to help is a bit strange, but fine.

1410
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
We'll just accept it.

1411
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
The only issue is that it felt a little bit rushed.

1412
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:35,000
And that's a really damning thing to say, considering how in other episodes that we've talked about before, they just take their sweet fucking time doing nothing.

1413
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Yep.

1414
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
This is not a show that could afford to waste two episodes worth of time.

1415
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I completely agree.

1416
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Like, the Kansas City, the queues, there weren't fireflies, there were other rebels that overthrew the Federer in Kansas City.

1417
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
That needed a full extra episode to cook.

1418
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,000
And this one probably also needed a full extra episode to cook.

1419
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
And instead we got those flashback episodes.

1420
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:08,000
So I do think that the show could have been better if it didn't shoot itself in the foot in that way.

1421
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
That's my take on it, though.

1422
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Because this was actually more fun, and I wish it was longer.

1423
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
And I wish they had more build up.

1424
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
With the characters and the whole reveal of them being cannibals.

1425
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
It was way too on the nose about the cannibal part.

1426
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Yep.

1427
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,000
More subtlety.

1428
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
They could definitely learn that lesson.

1429
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Let's talk about this food we're having, huh?

1430
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Guys, these big red plops of meat, that's bringing attention to it.

1431
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Like, probably not pointing towards the thing.

1432
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Yeah, in shows, there's often the trope where it's like, what's the meat?

1433
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
And then it looks over and it's just very raw, very red meat.

1434
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
And the characters just wait for an extra second longer than they should.

1435
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
And it's like, okay, we get it.

1436
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
That's human.

1437
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
That's human meat.

1438
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
For whatever reason, they never cook it, too, so it looks very gross.

1439
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Yeah.

1440
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
It's very on the nose.

1441
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Or in this case, the ear.

1442
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
We've got one episode left, I think.

1443
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Hold on, let's get it done.

1444
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Let's get it over with.

1445
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Well, not today.

1446
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
It's next week, man.

1447
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:11,000
It's next week.

1448
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Go find it.

1449
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Yeah, go steal it.

1450
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Well, the issue is, they now have to survive the winter.

1451
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
There's an extra sequence.

1452
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:27,000
They survive the winter, and then they get to Salt Lake City.

1453
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
And then there's a whole fucking shit show at Salt Lake City.

1454
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Then they have to go back to Tommy's town.

1455
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
So, I'm not sure if they can fit all of it in one episode.

1456
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
They gotta do that in one episode.

1457
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Yeah.

1458
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
They gotta cram it because of all this crappy filler, or it's just gonna skim like 90% of

1459
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
the stuff.

1460
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Yeah, there's like a big thing with the fireflies in Salt Lake City, and then they go back.

1461
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I feel like the pacing of the show is gonna be its downfall.

1462
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
They spent too much time on other shit that didn't matter.

1463
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Any of you three have final thoughts?

1464
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I would have eaten the horse.

1465
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
This episode was more violent, and I liked that part.

1466
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
That's about it.

1467
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,000
I think the destroying the pedal rapist was very empowering.

1468
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,000
It was very good watching Ellie just stab him for a full minute where that's all there

1469
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
was.

1470
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
It would be nice to see the corpse, but...

1471
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Yeah.

1472
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Hold on, Jesus.

1473
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Bloodthirsty Lilith over here.

1474
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
No, no, no.

1475
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Lilith is right, actually.

1476
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
This show has already shown that it's violent and grotesque, right?

1477
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
So why not actually make up a prop doll dummy of that actor, and then have her go to town

1478
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
on it and show it?

1479
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
That'd be kinda fun.

1480
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Walking Dead Season 2, the game, the second one, they did that with the villain that got

1481
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
beaten to death.

1482
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:52,000
They actually showed the corpse, but it was a video game.

1483
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
It's been so long since I played it.

1484
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
It's been at least five or six years.

1485
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
I recall that, though.

1486
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Yeah, I recall.

1487
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Well, in the end, you're like, Kenny gets to beat the villain to death, and you're given

1488
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
a choice of watching or not.

1489
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Right, yes.

1490
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Yeah.

1491
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
So, two more episodes down.

1492
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
We're coming across the end.

1493
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:18,000
We'll reunite one final time next week to watch the finale, unless my math is wrong.

1494
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I don't know why they have a nine-episode season.

1495
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
It's very strange, but I guess that's what they're doing.

1496
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
And then, I guess after that, what are we doing?

1497
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Are we watching the Halo show, Kibs?

1498
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Halo Season 2?

1499
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Yes.

1500
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I've said yes on behalf of Kibs.

1501
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Kibs will rewatch the Halo show.

1502
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
What's my revenge after that?

1503
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Because this is my revenge.

1504
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
You already owe me Dota.

1505
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Consider this the Dota.

1506
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
He's like, I will wash away the debt with your tears.

1507
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I will sacrifice Dota for you watching the entirety of Halo.

1508
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:53,000
You know, there is no limit to bad shows nowadays.

1509
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Like, you want to go watch Velma?

1510
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
You want to go watch the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air remake?

1511
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I watched it.

1512
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
That was just sad.

1513
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I remember Arch lamenting about it every episode he'd watch.

1514
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Oh, we can go watch Season 2 of Rings of Power.

1515
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
That'll be coming out, like, the end of the year.

1516
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Oh, yay, Deb.

1517
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I'm glad of all these stellar recommendations.

1518
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Like, honestly, this is not a good trend.

1519
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
We need to cover some good shows once in a while.

1520
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Otherwise, we're going to get stuck in the loop when the pendulum swing happens

1521
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
and good TV starts coming out.

1522
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
We're going to be in the dust.

1523
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
This was the good show.

1524
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
This was the good show, yeah.

1525
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
All right, come here, you little shit.

1526
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
So we'll see you guys next week.

1527
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Say goodbye, everyone.

1528
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Goodbye.

1529
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Take care.
