00:00.000 --> 00:06.680
So, it turns out that Lilith is late because she's making a meatloaf.

00:06.680 --> 00:07.680
Yes.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.680
I mean, I don't really blame Lilith.

00:10.680 --> 00:13.840
I mean, that's infinitely more interesting than a TV show, so.

00:13.840 --> 00:14.840
Meatloaf sounds tasty.

00:14.840 --> 00:15.840
Thank you.

00:15.840 --> 00:16.840
I'm glad you understand.

00:16.840 --> 00:17.840
Meatloaf is great.

00:17.840 --> 00:18.840
It takes priority.

00:18.840 --> 00:24.720
I thought it would be done earlier, but I guess the slab of meat I was working with

00:24.720 --> 00:28.560
today was bigger than the one I was working with last time, so.

00:28.560 --> 00:29.560
I gotta be honest.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.120
I've actually cooked a meatloaf before.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.120
Oh, it's super easy.

00:32.120 --> 00:33.120
Oh, yeah?

00:33.120 --> 00:40.920
You just cut it up, season it a bunch, put it on a metal plate, and put it in nothing.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.680
Do you stuff it with veggies?

00:42.680 --> 00:43.680
Do you put like- No.

00:43.680 --> 00:44.680
No?

00:44.680 --> 00:50.200
When I make homemade burgers, what I'll do is I'll stuff the meat with garlic, with onions,

00:50.200 --> 00:51.200
and with chopped kale.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.200
Oh, you can do that.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.200
You can do that, definitely.

00:53.200 --> 00:56.800
Lots of people like to rub garlic into it.

00:56.800 --> 01:01.160
If I had garlic, I would have done that, but I didn't, so I just used garlic salt today.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.160
Right, right.

01:02.160 --> 01:09.160
What you should be doing is you should be baking in egg and cheese.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.160
Oh.

01:10.160 --> 01:13.160
I've heard a lot about putting eggs in instead of breadcrumbs to find their meat together.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.160
I did add a little bit of cheese on mine.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.160
Yeah.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.520
Yeah, the egg is an interesting solution to bread, or alternative.

01:18.520 --> 01:20.520
So what do you do with the egg?

01:20.520 --> 01:24.720
Basically, when you have the- you take the meatloaf first, and instead of making it into

01:24.720 --> 01:30.280
the loaf, you have all the ground meat out in a long platter kind of thing.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.280
Uh-huh.

01:31.280 --> 01:35.120
Then you take the egg, you beat it up a little bit so it's nice and yellow and consistent

01:35.120 --> 01:38.880
up, kind of like you're making omelet, and then you just pour that on the center, and

01:38.880 --> 01:43.920
then you roll the meatloaf over it, and then you pack it in on both sides, so it's kind

01:43.920 --> 01:47.360
of in the center of the meatloaf, and then you roast as usual.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.360
Nice.

01:48.360 --> 01:49.360
Okay.

01:49.360 --> 01:54.200
Now this, you do need to cut into it to make sure that it's cooked on the inside, because

01:54.200 --> 01:58.080
if it isn't cooked through, you're going to have raw egg inside of your meat, and that's

01:58.080 --> 01:59.080
a problem.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.080
Yeah.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.080
Yeah, but like Sunnyside D.

02:01.080 --> 02:08.080
But it is actually quite delicious, and it's- if you cool it down, it's eatable, it's almost

02:08.080 --> 02:09.080
just like spread.

02:09.080 --> 02:12.280
You slice off a thin piece, put it on bread, and eat.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.160
So we're back together again to watch The Last of Us.

02:15.160 --> 02:20.680
You know, when we were watching The Rings of Power, even though it was really, really

02:20.680 --> 02:24.960
bad, it was kind of like a momentous occasion, you know, because Lord of the Rings is a much

02:24.960 --> 02:30.100
bigger property than The Last of Us, and Rings of Power was a much bigger shitshow than this

02:30.100 --> 02:31.720
show was turning out to be.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.900
I don't know how I feel about watching a good show on my channel, or at least like a passing

02:34.900 --> 02:36.280
show on my channel, you know?

02:36.280 --> 02:40.600
Yeah, better stop then, because we're just development.

02:40.600 --> 02:41.600
That's what we'll do.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.600
I have to hate watch.

02:42.600 --> 02:49.880
It could be better, because that's the thing, this is a passing show, but it's no Spartacus,

02:49.880 --> 02:51.280
it's no Rome.

02:51.280 --> 02:55.040
It's no the first few seasons of Game of Thrones, you know?

02:55.040 --> 02:57.120
Game of Thrones, sub-tier to Rome.

02:57.120 --> 03:03.920
And man, you know what, speaking of just passable shows, I watched season 3 episode 1 of Picard,

03:03.920 --> 03:08.760
and I was surprised that it was mediocre, because Picard has been the worst show I've

03:08.760 --> 03:14.240
ever seen in my fucking life for two seasons, and it's bumped up massively to just being

03:14.240 --> 03:15.600
normal bad.

03:15.600 --> 03:20.320
I tried to get into the Trek of the Stars, and I did so by trying to watch Picard.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.600
So I'm like, yeah, I'll get in on the ground floor of this, let's see what everybody's

03:23.600 --> 03:24.600
talking about.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.640
I watched the first episode, and I was like, well, time's wrong again.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.640
This is shit.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.760
You start, hold on, your first episode of Star Trek-

03:30.760 --> 03:33.260
That's probably not the best place to start.

03:33.260 --> 03:38.840
Your first episode of Star Trek was the worst show of all time?

03:38.840 --> 03:43.780
Actually, to be fair, my first proper Star Trek that I watched was STD, which I kind

03:43.780 --> 03:46.140
of enjoyed, because it was just a stupid action show.

03:46.140 --> 03:47.460
Oh, god damn it.

03:47.460 --> 03:50.180
Go back and watch the good stuff, go back and watch TNG and DS9.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.660
He doesn't like it.

03:51.660 --> 03:56.180
He did try to give DS9 a swing, which I'll give him credit for that, but sadly it didn't

03:56.180 --> 03:58.160
stick with him, which breaks my heart.

03:58.160 --> 04:03.460
So when I started dating Naomi, Naomi's a Zoomer, she's younger than me, so I'm a millennial,

04:03.460 --> 04:05.820
and she hadn't ever seen anything about Star Trek before.

04:05.820 --> 04:06.820
Age gap.

04:06.820 --> 04:07.820
That makes you a pedophile.

04:07.820 --> 04:10.820
I'm gonna get cancelled for the age gap, yeah.

04:10.820 --> 04:14.700
I'm gonna get cancelled by all the TikTok Zoomers.

04:14.700 --> 04:18.780
So I sat down with her and I'm like, listen, Naomi, we're watching every single piece of

04:18.780 --> 04:22.420
Star Trek in order of release, and we went through the whole thing.

04:22.420 --> 04:27.700
We went through, we did the original series from 1967 or whatever, we did the animated

04:27.700 --> 04:32.540
series, we did the movies, we did TNG, DS9, Voyager, we did all of it.

04:32.540 --> 04:39.500
And she became a Star Trek hyper fan just in time to be let down by all the new Trek.

04:39.500 --> 04:44.260
It's tragic, but that's actually kind of where I'm at with that, too, because I didn't

04:44.260 --> 04:45.260
find-

04:45.260 --> 04:46.260
Well, what's her favorite character?

04:46.260 --> 04:47.260
Her favorite character?

04:47.260 --> 04:48.260
Yeah.

04:48.260 --> 04:49.260
Oh, Jesus.

04:49.260 --> 04:50.260
That's gonna be a hard one, too.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.260
Actually, I don't know what her favorite character would be.

04:52.260 --> 04:56.260
Naomi, what is your favorite Star Trek character of all time?

04:56.260 --> 04:57.260
Of all time?

04:57.260 --> 04:58.260
Yeah.

04:58.260 --> 04:59.260
I can't pick just one.

04:59.260 --> 05:00.260
Come on, pick one.

05:00.260 --> 05:01.260
Yeah, see?

05:01.260 --> 05:02.260
That's a hard question.

05:02.260 --> 05:07.100
Yeah, I knew it would be.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.300
One of the entire franchise.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.300
Oof.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.300
I don't know.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.300
Odo's pretty close.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.300
I mean-

05:12.300 --> 05:13.300
Odo?

05:13.300 --> 05:14.300
Yeah.

05:14.300 --> 05:15.300
I like Odo.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.300
I could pick.

05:16.300 --> 05:17.300
I can't pick one.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.300
Can you pick one for each show?

05:18.300 --> 05:19.300
Like, original series?

05:19.300 --> 05:20.300
Original series is Spock.

05:20.300 --> 05:21.300
Yes, of course.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.300
And then TNG is...

05:22.300 --> 05:23.300
Was obviously Picard.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.300
But he was ruined by Picard.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.300
Yeah.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.300
Well, you know what?

05:26.300 --> 05:27.300
We're not talking about Picard.

05:27.300 --> 05:34.300
We're talking about the character of Picard in TNG where he was good.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.300
Okay?

05:35.300 --> 05:38.620
Well, to be fair, Picard also ruined Data.

05:38.620 --> 05:40.620
So you can't even fall back on that.

05:40.620 --> 05:41.620
Yeah, exactly.

05:41.620 --> 05:42.620
Yeah.

05:42.620 --> 05:43.620
So...

05:43.620 --> 05:44.620
Odo and DS9, obviously.

05:44.620 --> 05:45.620
DS9 was...

05:45.620 --> 05:46.620
Yeah.

05:46.620 --> 05:47.620
Odo for DS9.

05:47.620 --> 05:48.620
Voyager?

05:48.620 --> 05:49.620
Then Voyager...

05:49.620 --> 05:50.620
Probably Seven of Nine, realistically.

05:50.620 --> 05:51.620
Is that just because she's not-

05:51.620 --> 05:52.620
No.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.620
I like her character arc.

05:53.620 --> 05:54.620
Oh, yeah.

05:54.620 --> 06:01.260
She has lots of arcs going all over her body, I know.

06:01.260 --> 06:05.620
I can tell based on your face that's what you were thinking of, too.

06:05.620 --> 06:06.620
No, it wasn't.

06:06.620 --> 06:07.620
All right.

06:07.620 --> 06:08.620
You know me.

06:08.620 --> 06:09.620
You're abandoned.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.620
Dev.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.620
Yes?

06:11.620 --> 06:12.620
It's EMH.

06:12.620 --> 06:16.420
The EMH Doctor is the best character in Voyager.

06:16.420 --> 06:17.420
Not Seven of Nine.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.820
You have to break up with him.

06:19.820 --> 06:21.620
The EMH is actually an interesting character.

06:21.620 --> 06:22.620
Yeah, the Doctor.

06:22.620 --> 06:26.460
He's a great actor, and he's an opera singer, too, if I remember right.

06:26.460 --> 06:27.980
There's one final thing I must confirm.

06:27.980 --> 06:28.980
Okay.

06:28.980 --> 06:29.980
What's up?

06:29.980 --> 06:30.980
Naomi.

06:30.980 --> 06:31.980
Dev.

06:31.980 --> 06:32.980
Okay.

06:32.980 --> 06:34.980
Your Enterprise character was T'Pol, right?

06:34.980 --> 06:35.980
Oh, fuck.

06:35.980 --> 06:36.980
The Enterprise.

06:37.340 --> 06:38.340
Yeah, it's because of the curves.

06:38.340 --> 06:39.340
I know.

06:39.340 --> 06:40.340
Thank you.

06:40.340 --> 06:41.340
All right.

06:41.340 --> 06:42.480
Enterprise doesn't count.

06:42.480 --> 06:44.180
It's been a long time.

06:44.180 --> 06:45.180
I hate that intro.

06:45.180 --> 06:48.820
I think we've sexually shamed Naomi enough for liking hot TV women.

06:48.820 --> 06:52.340
Should we watch the zombie show now?

06:52.340 --> 06:53.820
I mean, I guess we can.

06:53.820 --> 06:54.820
I think it's time.

06:54.820 --> 06:55.820
I think it's time.

06:55.820 --> 06:56.820
We can commence.

06:56.820 --> 07:00.700
Oh, I put mushrooms sometimes in my burgers, too.

07:00.700 --> 07:03.100
Just chop them up like little tiny mushroom chops.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.100
Little pieces and put them in the burgers.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.100
Yeah.

07:06.220 --> 07:09.220
Give me a gun.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.220
Oh, shit.

07:10.220 --> 07:12.220
I gotta turn on subtitles.

07:12.220 --> 07:14.220
Give me a gun.

07:14.220 --> 07:15.220
Whoops.

07:15.220 --> 07:16.220
Henry, no!

07:16.220 --> 07:17.220
By a black person.

07:17.220 --> 07:19.220
Leading cause of death in America.

07:19.220 --> 07:20.220
Wow.

07:20.220 --> 07:21.220
Black person.

07:21.220 --> 07:23.620
His arch celebrates.

07:23.620 --> 07:25.020
That is very arch.

07:25.020 --> 07:26.020
Ah.

07:26.020 --> 07:27.020
Home.

07:27.020 --> 07:30.140
Actually, it's a bit too flat to be home.

07:30.140 --> 07:36.020
You always realized they're not doing the four seasons thing that Last of Us did.

07:36.020 --> 07:38.740
Do you remember that, Lilith and Kibs?

07:38.740 --> 07:39.740
Oh, yeah.

07:39.740 --> 07:40.740
They went through the seasons.

07:40.740 --> 07:41.740
Yeah.

07:41.740 --> 07:43.740
They divided the game into quarters based on the season.

07:43.740 --> 07:44.740
Motherfucker.

07:44.740 --> 07:45.740
That's impressive.

07:45.740 --> 07:54.220
Oh, this is going to be nine episodes, right?

07:54.220 --> 07:55.220
Miniseries?

07:55.220 --> 07:56.220
Nine or ten?

07:56.220 --> 07:57.220
Oh, God.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.220
Wow.

07:58.220 --> 08:04.220
You've, uh, you've lived through the apocalypse well, honey.

08:04.220 --> 08:07.340
Not bad.

08:07.340 --> 08:09.020
You must be a very good hunter.

08:09.020 --> 08:11.020
Who the hell are you?

08:11.020 --> 08:14.620
There's someone passing through.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.620
Take the gun out.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.620
Two fingers only.

08:16.620 --> 08:17.620
Put it out of reach.

08:17.620 --> 08:18.620
Why did you shoot him?

08:18.620 --> 08:21.620
The gun's all the way over there.

08:21.620 --> 08:25.020
He didn't hurt me, by the way.

08:25.020 --> 08:28.020
He's got a girl with him.

08:28.020 --> 08:31.020
Can I con-jow?

08:31.020 --> 08:32.020
No.

08:32.020 --> 08:33.020
Henry.

08:33.820 --> 08:35.820
What did I just say?

08:35.820 --> 08:36.820
Joel, come on.

08:36.820 --> 08:37.820
There's like a thousand.

08:37.820 --> 08:38.820
Who's this little psycho?

08:38.820 --> 08:39.820
Never mind her.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.820
I need you to tell us where we are.

08:41.820 --> 08:42.820
You got a map?

08:42.820 --> 08:43.820
Why you lost?

08:43.820 --> 08:45.820
You must have missed all the street signs in the enormous fucking forest.

08:45.820 --> 08:46.820
Holy.

08:46.820 --> 08:51.820
I like how they're just laughing at her.

08:51.820 --> 08:52.820
Exactly where?

08:52.820 --> 08:54.820
And your answer better be the same as your wife's.

08:54.820 --> 08:57.820
Did you tell them the truth?

08:57.820 --> 08:58.820
Yeah.

08:58.820 --> 09:01.820
Are you telling me the truth?

09:01.820 --> 09:02.820
Yeah.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.620
What about the fireflies?

09:05.620 --> 09:07.620
We get those in the summer.

09:07.620 --> 09:08.620
Not the bugs.

09:08.620 --> 09:09.620
The people.

09:09.620 --> 09:12.620
There are firefly people?

09:12.620 --> 09:14.620
Oh my god.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.620
You got any advice on the best way to...

09:16.620 --> 09:19.620
What are the best characters so far?

09:19.620 --> 09:20.620
Gooey.

09:20.620 --> 09:25.520
So having had a bunch of experience with like native people living on reservations in Canada,

09:25.520 --> 09:28.220
they are exactly like this.

09:28.220 --> 09:29.220
Don't give a fuck.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.220
Just relax and chillin' out.

09:31.220 --> 09:32.220
Put that back.

09:32.620 --> 09:33.620
I don't know anything.

09:33.620 --> 09:35.620
You're stealing a rabbit.

09:40.620 --> 09:41.620
Joel?

09:41.620 --> 09:42.620
Joel?

09:42.620 --> 09:43.620
Joel, are you okay?

09:43.620 --> 09:44.620
Joel?

09:44.620 --> 09:45.620
Shut up.

09:45.620 --> 09:46.620
Holy shit.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.620
Are you dying?

09:47.620 --> 09:48.620
I'm okay.

09:48.620 --> 09:49.620
I'm okay.

09:49.620 --> 09:50.620
I'm okay.

09:50.620 --> 09:51.620
I'm fine.

09:51.620 --> 09:52.620
No, no.

09:52.620 --> 09:53.620
But are you?

09:53.620 --> 09:54.620
Because just to remind you that you're dead.

09:54.620 --> 09:55.620
I'm fucked.

09:55.620 --> 09:56.620
I'm fine.

09:56.620 --> 09:57.620
Okay.

09:57.620 --> 09:59.620
It's just the cold air.

10:00.020 --> 10:01.020
Oh, I saw you.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.020
I think this is new.

10:10.020 --> 10:13.020
I don't recall Joel having an old man sickness.

10:13.020 --> 10:17.020
Yeah, I've been hearing something that they hinted at in the beginning episode.

10:17.020 --> 10:21.020
That's new information, or made up information, whatever you want to call it.

10:21.020 --> 10:27.820
If they're smart, they'll kill his ass via natural causes instead of the way he went

10:27.820 --> 10:30.820
in that other game.

10:30.820 --> 10:33.820
The unceremonious death by fucking golf club.

10:33.820 --> 10:34.820
Uh huh.

10:34.820 --> 10:35.820
Fuck.

10:35.820 --> 10:38.820
And then they try to get you to sympathize with the character that killed him.

10:38.820 --> 10:39.820
Yep.

10:39.820 --> 10:40.820
Mm-hmm.

10:40.820 --> 10:41.820
That didn't work out so well.

10:41.820 --> 10:42.820
Don't be like that very much.

10:42.820 --> 10:43.820
Close the dark.

10:43.820 --> 10:44.820
No, nobody did.

10:44.820 --> 10:45.820
There's some caves along the river.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.820
We'll set up camp there, cross in the morning.

10:47.820 --> 10:49.820
Yeah, it's a better way for him to go.

10:49.820 --> 10:50.820
Just keep moving.

10:50.820 --> 10:51.820
One could be so lucky.

10:51.820 --> 10:54.820
That rabbit is so fucking fake, by the way.

10:54.820 --> 10:55.820
Oh yeah.

10:55.820 --> 10:56.820
Yep.

10:56.820 --> 10:59.820
That's too big to be like a...

10:59.820 --> 11:00.820
Well the eyes of a woman.

11:00.820 --> 11:02.260
That size isn't necessarily wrong.

11:02.260 --> 11:04.820
What gives it away is that thing is still flopping.

11:04.820 --> 11:08.820
It's been dead for hours, it should be stiff as a board.

11:08.820 --> 11:10.820
Can I have some?

11:10.820 --> 11:11.820
No.

11:11.820 --> 11:16.820
What, just to warm up?

11:16.820 --> 11:20.220
Unscientific fact, alcohol does not actually make you warmer.

11:20.220 --> 11:23.820
Nope, it just makes you numb.

11:24.820 --> 11:27.820
Cough, cough, cough.

11:27.820 --> 11:28.820
Yep.

11:28.820 --> 11:29.820
So gross.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.820
You know, I'm a grown man at this point.

11:31.820 --> 11:34.820
I still don't like the taste of hard liquor.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.820
I don't think anybody does.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.820
It's fucking awful.

11:38.820 --> 11:41.820
I would raise sheep.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.820
They're quiet.

11:43.820 --> 11:45.820
Do what they're told.

11:45.820 --> 11:47.820
Actually, no.

11:47.820 --> 11:48.820
Not in the slightest.

11:48.820 --> 11:50.820
They're snarky as fuck.

11:50.820 --> 11:52.820
They haven't been around sheeps, they're not quiet.

11:52.820 --> 11:54.820
Nor do they do what they're told.

11:54.820 --> 11:56.820
They're disobedient little shits.

11:56.820 --> 11:58.820
What about you, where are you gonna go?

11:58.820 --> 12:00.820
He's gonna be a sheep fucker.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.820
Look at all that meat left on that poor rabbit.

12:02.820 --> 12:05.820
Yeah, it's just grilling there.

12:05.820 --> 12:08.820
They couldn't have been very hungry, I guess.

12:08.820 --> 12:09.820
Yeah.

12:09.820 --> 12:11.820
They've been doing pretty well with the journey, I guess.

12:11.820 --> 12:13.820
No fetish in the morning.

12:13.820 --> 12:14.820
What can I say, man?

12:14.820 --> 12:17.820
I'm a natural.

12:17.820 --> 12:21.820
What amazes me is that's a grown woman and that rifle still looks like it'll bowl her

12:21.820 --> 12:23.820
over if she fired it.

12:23.820 --> 12:25.820
Yeah.

12:25.820 --> 12:29.820
She looks like a grown woman the same way that Greta Thunberg now looks like a grown woman.

12:29.820 --> 12:31.820
Like, I know she's 18.

12:31.820 --> 12:35.820
Yeah, well, she's 18, but she's tiny as fuck, you know?

12:35.820 --> 12:41.820
And her parents specifically dress and groom her to look like a fucking 10-year-old.

12:41.820 --> 12:44.820
When you say groom in the context of Greta Thunberg, it just sounds bad.

12:44.820 --> 12:47.820
Well, I mean it in both contexts in this case.

12:47.820 --> 12:50.820
Oh, no.

12:50.820 --> 12:52.820
Fine.

12:55.820 --> 12:59.820
Ah, yes, fire your gun and then wait for about five seconds.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.820
Then walk out of cover.

13:01.820 --> 13:03.820
That's pretty smart.

13:03.820 --> 13:06.820
I'm sure anyone watching would have given up after the first three.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.820
Actually, Arch, it's not just her parents.

13:08.820 --> 13:11.820
Did you see that there were some...

13:11.820 --> 13:15.820
I think they were rhinoids because they were coming at it from an anti-environmentalist perspective,

13:15.820 --> 13:20.820
but they were talking about how now that Greta Thunberg is 18, she's certain OnlyFans.

13:20.820 --> 13:25.820
I'm like, Jesus, guys. Calm the fuck down with that.

13:25.820 --> 13:27.820
What?

13:27.820 --> 13:31.820
I'm assuming how she's been raised for quite enough time, I think.

13:31.820 --> 13:37.820
I just imagine a chick that has been repressed that hard by her parents and controlled that hard for this long.

13:37.820 --> 13:40.820
Oh, there's going to be some behaviour there.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.820
Oh, like going off to a party at university or something?

13:43.820 --> 13:45.820
You don't know how to whistle?

13:45.820 --> 13:47.820
Does it sound like I know how to whistle?

13:47.820 --> 13:49.820
No.

13:49.820 --> 13:52.820
Seriously, though, how the fuck do you do that?

13:52.820 --> 13:53.820
Tyler.

13:53.820 --> 13:54.820
Whatever.

13:54.820 --> 13:56.820
You should teach me how to hunt.

13:56.820 --> 13:57.820
Oh.

13:57.820 --> 14:00.820
That's such a wise answer.

14:00.820 --> 14:04.820
Tyler is genuinely actually pretty good at their interactions.

14:04.820 --> 14:07.820
Yeah, they're getting there for sure.

14:07.820 --> 14:09.820
Damn.

14:09.820 --> 14:10.820
Correct.

14:10.820 --> 14:12.820
You know Will Livingston.

14:12.820 --> 14:15.820
Yeah, but who is?

14:15.820 --> 14:17.820
So that made electricity?

14:17.820 --> 14:21.820
Yeah. Don't ask me. I don't have a clue.

14:21.820 --> 14:27.820
I mean, theoretically, it still should. A hydroelectric dam doesn't require a lot of maintenance, but...

14:27.820 --> 14:30.820
Oh, no.

14:36.820 --> 14:40.820
Oh, look, another group of outlaws with a female leader.

14:41.820 --> 14:43.820
How about you shut the fuck up?

14:43.820 --> 14:44.820
OK. Easy.

14:44.820 --> 14:47.820
They do say women are the future.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.820
They're apparently correct.

14:49.820 --> 14:51.820
Last chance for a bullet.

14:51.820 --> 14:55.820
But you've earned the fact that he will smell it and he will rip you up.

14:57.820 --> 14:59.820
Oh, shit.

15:06.820 --> 15:08.820
Now her.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.820
Oh.

15:28.820 --> 15:29.820
That's lucky.

15:29.820 --> 15:30.820
What's her name?

15:30.820 --> 15:32.820
There's the leader. Like barge called...

15:32.820 --> 15:33.820
Oh, dang.

15:33.820 --> 15:34.820
Oh, obviously.

15:35.820 --> 15:40.820
I guess the smart thing is to build your new town somewhere else, since all the old ones are too infected.

15:40.820 --> 15:43.820
Oh, yeah. Away from civilization.

15:43.820 --> 15:47.820
Rather than doing QZs, like Fedra did.

15:48.820 --> 15:54.820
Yeah, then you scatter fake powder snow on it, which is just white sand.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.820
And voila! Home.

15:56.820 --> 16:05.820
I hate how all of these shows are... shows snow. I hate video game snow.

16:05.820 --> 16:07.820
Nobody gets snow right.

16:07.820 --> 16:09.820
Yeah.

16:11.820 --> 16:15.820
You know, my front yard currently has like ten feet of snow in it.

16:15.820 --> 16:18.820
You gotta learn how to do snow, guys.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.820
I came here to save you.

16:34.820 --> 16:37.820
Are these the good guys?

16:41.820 --> 16:44.820
Oh, they've got electricity. That's nice.

16:46.820 --> 16:49.820
Oh, they took the look of this place from the second game.

16:49.820 --> 16:50.820
There's more if you need it.

16:50.820 --> 16:51.820
Unfortunately.

16:51.820 --> 16:52.820
Thank you, ma'am.

16:52.820 --> 16:56.820
Yes, this is the second game settlement where they settle down.

17:17.820 --> 17:18.820
Oh.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.820
Kevs, did you recognize?

17:21.820 --> 17:23.820
Was that the Jewish lady?

17:27.820 --> 17:30.820
That looks like her girlfriend in the second game.

17:31.820 --> 17:32.820
Ah, cringe.

17:33.820 --> 17:34.820
I hate this show now.

17:35.820 --> 17:38.820
They're bringing in like second season stuff or something.

17:40.820 --> 17:42.820
I hope they never get a second season.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.820
Maria is family, actually.

17:55.820 --> 17:58.820
Oh, shit. Congrats.

18:00.820 --> 18:02.820
Joel, say congrats.

18:06.820 --> 18:07.820
Congrats.

18:09.820 --> 18:11.820
House of Worship. Multifaith.

18:11.820 --> 18:13.820
School. Laundry.

18:13.820 --> 18:16.820
O Bank works as the J on that we've muted.

18:16.820 --> 18:17.820
You draw power from a dam.

18:17.820 --> 18:19.820
Got that working a couple of years ago.

18:20.820 --> 18:21.820
Nice.

18:27.820 --> 18:29.820
And they're sheeps.

18:35.820 --> 18:36.820
Oh, boys.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.820
Of course.

18:42.820 --> 18:43.820
The commune.

18:44.820 --> 18:46.820
They're democratically elected.

18:47.820 --> 18:48.820
Hunting.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.820
It's The Last of Us Part Two.

18:50.820 --> 18:52.820
Greenhouses, livestock.

18:52.820 --> 18:53.820
All shared.

18:53.820 --> 18:54.820
Nope.

18:54.820 --> 18:55.820
Communes.

18:55.820 --> 18:56.820
It is a commune.

18:56.820 --> 18:57.820
Communism.

18:57.820 --> 18:58.820
Yes.

18:58.820 --> 18:59.820
Oh.

18:59.820 --> 19:00.820
It ain't like that.

19:00.820 --> 19:01.820
It is that.

19:01.820 --> 19:02.820
Literally.

19:02.820 --> 19:03.820
This is a commune.

19:03.820 --> 19:04.820
We're communists.

19:04.820 --> 19:05.820
Oh, OK.

19:05.820 --> 19:06.820
No way.

19:06.820 --> 19:08.820
That's our newest one.

19:08.820 --> 19:09.820
Couple months old.

19:09.820 --> 19:10.820
You want a pet?

19:10.820 --> 19:11.820
Oh, there you go.

19:11.820 --> 19:15.820
All you need for communism to succeed is the death of 99% of the population.

19:15.820 --> 19:21.820
99% of humanity and collapse of civilization.

19:21.820 --> 19:24.820
A small, vacated, armed commune.

19:24.820 --> 19:28.820
Not to mention, you know, a rider to shoehorn everything to work.

19:29.820 --> 19:33.820
This actually makes sense because this is how the Zapatistas run things in Mexico.

19:33.820 --> 19:41.820
They live in one of the poorest, most dysfunctional, most undeveloped places in the entire world, even including Africa.

19:41.820 --> 19:49.820
And the only way they, like, basically the social organization that communism brought them actually advanced them.

19:49.820 --> 19:52.820
But only because they had literally nothing.

19:52.820 --> 19:56.820
And some organization, even bad organization, is better than nothing.

19:56.820 --> 19:57.820
You on the other hand.

19:57.820 --> 19:58.820
Yep.

19:59.820 --> 20:04.820
Literally, when the world is a zombie apocalypse, communism might be a valley sculpture.

20:06.820 --> 20:07.820
So how's Tess?

20:08.820 --> 20:09.820
Dead.

20:09.820 --> 20:10.820
She's fine.

20:10.820 --> 20:11.820
So you know where they might be?

20:11.820 --> 20:12.820
These fireflies?

20:13.820 --> 20:16.820
They got a base down at the University of Eastern Colorado.

20:17.820 --> 20:19.820
It's a week's ride south.

20:20.820 --> 20:25.820
I continue to be impressed by the fact that they still have alcohol after the last, like, 20-odd years.

20:25.820 --> 20:27.820
I'm not sure how much they'd be drinking it.

20:28.820 --> 20:29.820
Maybe they're making some now.

20:31.820 --> 20:32.820
I could make moonshine.

20:32.820 --> 20:34.820
Yeah, you could just make some.

20:35.820 --> 20:36.820
That doesn't look like much.

20:36.820 --> 20:37.820
I'm not sure.

20:52.820 --> 20:54.820
Is Joel gonna be bitter about it?

21:00.820 --> 21:02.820
Yep. That's what it is.

21:02.820 --> 21:07.820
Is that a cool Christmas thing going on?

21:08.820 --> 21:09.820
How nice.

21:11.820 --> 21:13.820
You really shouldn't be doing that.

21:16.820 --> 21:19.820
Resist the urge to lick the pole, Joel.

21:20.820 --> 21:23.820
Joel, get stuck there, and this'll turn into the comedy.

21:23.820 --> 21:24.820
Yep.

21:25.820 --> 21:34.820
Remember, kids, do not touch metal in winter with exposed palms or tongues. Bad idea.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.820
Uh, he's seeing her.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.820
It's hair product, by the way. She probably was able to maintain that.

21:42.820 --> 21:43.820
Yeah.

21:44.820 --> 21:45.820
They're also manufacturing that, too.

21:46.820 --> 21:53.820
If ancient Egyptians can make hair product, then why can't you make it in a post office?

21:54.820 --> 21:55.820
Hmm.

21:57.820 --> 22:03.820
Because modern day people don't know how to grow fucking carrots, much less make horse products.

22:03.820 --> 22:04.820
Yeah, there we go. Horse products.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.820
Wait, I'm across the street.

22:08.820 --> 22:10.820
Oh, are they gonna start the romance early?

22:11.820 --> 22:13.820
Uh, cringe.

22:13.820 --> 22:14.820
Oh.

22:18.820 --> 22:19.820
Gross.

22:20.820 --> 22:25.820
20 year old period cup. Jesus. There's no way it still works. It'd be crinkling.

22:26.820 --> 22:28.820
Also, sadly, it's not one of those anti-rape ones.

22:29.820 --> 22:30.820
Oh, with the hooks?

22:31.820 --> 22:32.820
Teeth inside.

22:37.820 --> 22:38.820
Hello?

22:39.820 --> 22:41.820
Wait, is everyone's door just open in the commune?

22:41.820 --> 22:43.820
Of course. It's real communism, Kev.

22:44.820 --> 22:46.820
Kibs? Dev? I don't even know who you are anymore.

22:47.820 --> 22:49.820
Don't fucking mistake me for Dev, you son of a bitch.

22:50.820 --> 22:51.820
Wait, look at the house.

22:52.820 --> 22:53.820
It's pristine.

22:54.820 --> 22:55.820
No, I think it's the same house as...

22:56.820 --> 22:57.820
Yeah, this is... most of this is Last of Us Part 2 stuff.

22:58.820 --> 23:00.820
Well, no, no, no. It's the same house as Bill's house. They just changed the furniture.

23:02.820 --> 23:03.820
No. No.

23:04.820 --> 23:05.820
I think so.

23:06.820 --> 23:07.820
Dev, you're fucking high, Dev.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.820
This is where the, um, the dining room was.

23:11.820 --> 23:12.820
No, it wasn't.

23:12.820 --> 23:13.820
It wouldn't do that.

23:14.820 --> 23:15.820
Dev, you're high.

23:16.820 --> 23:17.820
Dev, sit.

23:18.820 --> 23:19.820
I think it is.

23:20.820 --> 23:28.820
Like, they have all this budget for all these locations, and you think they would have to reuse the house.

23:29.820 --> 23:32.820
I was an assistant district attorney out of Omaha, Nebraska.

23:34.820 --> 23:35.820
I put bad guys in jail.

23:36.820 --> 23:37.820
Oh, cool, I guess.

23:38.820 --> 23:39.820
Oh, how about Harris?

23:40.820 --> 23:41.820
Hahaha.

24:03.820 --> 24:04.820
Hahaha.

24:04.820 --> 24:06.820
So that conversation is...

24:07.820 --> 24:10.820
It was different, but it was close enough to what they did in the game.

24:18.820 --> 24:22.820
This is the most fucking abundant post-apocalypse I think I've ever seen.

24:23.820 --> 24:24.820
Haha, yep.

24:25.820 --> 24:27.820
No, it's communism. You know, it's golden.

24:29.820 --> 24:30.820
Yeah, okay.

24:31.820 --> 24:35.820
I think within the lore, it's explained in some places that have more warning than others.

24:54.820 --> 24:55.820
She's in...

24:59.820 --> 25:00.820
Tongues, actually.

25:01.820 --> 25:02.820
Haha, yeah.

25:24.820 --> 25:27.820
Because I was too slow and too fucking deaf to hear him coming.

25:29.820 --> 25:30.820
I was so afraid.

25:34.820 --> 25:39.820
You think I can still handle things, but I'm not who I was.

25:40.820 --> 25:41.820
I'm weak.

25:42.820 --> 25:50.820
Lately, there are these moments where the fear comes up out of nowhere, and my heart feels like it stopped.

25:54.820 --> 25:59.820
Yeah, this is all new. He didn't have this in, like, panic attacks. He didn't have these in the original game.

26:00.820 --> 26:01.820
You know, you just slaughtered people wholesale.

26:02.820 --> 26:05.820
Sudden onset pussy-itis.

26:06.820 --> 26:07.820
Haha, unfortunate, but yes.

26:08.820 --> 26:11.820
A common affliction in this day and age among straight men.

26:13.820 --> 26:15.820
I've lost something.

26:16.820 --> 26:18.820
I'm failing in my sleep.

26:20.820 --> 26:21.820
It's all I do.

26:22.820 --> 26:23.820
It's all I've ever done.

26:24.820 --> 26:26.820
I remember Joel being, like, a defeatist.

26:29.820 --> 26:30.820
He had his moments, for sure.

26:39.820 --> 26:42.820
Just a few minutes ago, the show told us that you can't trust anybody.

26:43.820 --> 26:45.820
Because the only people you can betray are the people you trust.

26:46.820 --> 26:47.820
I wonder what's gonna happen next.

26:54.820 --> 26:55.820
No locks.

26:56.820 --> 26:57.820
Nowhere. They've been outlawed.

26:58.820 --> 27:00.820
Oh man, look at that old-school Mac!

27:04.820 --> 27:07.820
In communism, you must trust your neighbor.

27:25.820 --> 27:27.820
What exactly did you hear?

27:29.820 --> 27:31.820
I have to leave her. You have to take her.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.820
You know, I stood up for you today because I thought...

27:43.820 --> 27:45.820
I made this decision for your own good.

27:46.820 --> 27:48.820
You'll be way better off with Tommy.

27:49.820 --> 27:51.820
He knows the area better than I do.

27:52.820 --> 27:53.820
Do you give a shit about me or not?

27:54.820 --> 27:55.820
Then what are you so afraid of?

28:00.820 --> 28:01.820
I'm not her, you know.

28:04.820 --> 28:06.820
Maria told me about Sarah and...

28:06.820 --> 28:07.820
No.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.820
Don't say another word.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.820
I'm sorry about your daughter, Joel.

28:20.820 --> 28:21.820
But I have lost people too.

28:22.820 --> 28:24.820
You have no idea what loss is.

28:26.820 --> 28:30.820
Everybody I have cared for has either died or left me.

28:31.820 --> 28:33.820
Everybody fucking except for you!

28:34.820 --> 28:36.820
So don't tell me that I'd be safe with somebody else,

28:37.820 --> 28:39.820
because the truth is, I would just be more scared.

28:47.820 --> 28:48.820
You're right.

28:48.820 --> 28:49.820
You're right.

28:50.820 --> 28:51.820
You're not my daughter.

28:52.820 --> 28:54.820
And I sure as hell ain't your dad.

28:57.820 --> 28:58.820
Now come down.

28:59.820 --> 29:01.820
We're going our separate ways.

29:12.820 --> 29:13.820
Melodrama.

29:14.820 --> 29:15.820
Well...

29:15.820 --> 29:17.820
And the most fucking formulaic one as well.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.820
I don't like you. I don't like you either.

29:20.820 --> 29:21.820
Save it later.

29:21.820 --> 29:22.820
So here's the thing.

29:23.820 --> 29:25.820
They changed something drastic in that scene.

29:26.820 --> 29:27.820
That was line for line.

29:28.820 --> 29:30.820
The same scene in the show, which I can appreciate.

29:31.820 --> 29:38.820
But in the game, that was the first moment of weakness that Joel ever showed.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.820
Was in that conversation with Ellie.

29:42.820 --> 29:44.820
And it was supposed to be an important moment.

29:45.820 --> 29:47.820
But he's already shown weakness.

29:48.820 --> 29:49.820
He's shown a lot of it.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.820
Yes, this whole episode has been him showing weakness,

29:53.820 --> 29:58.820
and it kind of dulled the impact of that scene quite a bit.

30:00.820 --> 30:01.820
I play as Devil's advocate.

30:02.820 --> 30:09.820
I think them showing him weakness prior to that was so that line wouldn't come across as jarring to the viewer.

30:10.820 --> 30:11.820
We're out of nowhere.

30:12.820 --> 30:13.820
You think?

30:14.820 --> 30:16.820
I'm guessing that's the reason why they did that.

30:18.820 --> 30:25.820
I remember in the game, it comes across as Joel's first moment of,

30:26.820 --> 30:27.820
Oh, he actually does care about this girl.

30:28.820 --> 30:29.820
And it's not just all about Tess.

30:30.820 --> 30:32.820
And then he immediately squashes that down.

30:33.820 --> 30:35.820
And you can see what's going on with Joel when he does it.

30:36.820 --> 30:40.820
But in this, that whole scene with Tommy I think ruined that sentiment.

30:44.820 --> 30:45.820
Maybe.

30:48.820 --> 30:51.820
I do appreciate that they did it line for line and shot for shot again,

30:52.820 --> 30:54.820
but I guess you can't get everything right, eh?

30:55.820 --> 30:57.820
I came here to steal one of these horses and go.

30:58.820 --> 30:59.820
Well, it gave you one.

31:00.820 --> 31:01.820
I know.

31:02.820 --> 31:09.820
Anyway, that was 30 minutes ago, and I guess you deserve a choice.

31:10.820 --> 31:11.820
I still think you'd be better off with Tommy.

31:12.820 --> 31:13.820
Let's go.

31:14.820 --> 31:17.820
Okay, well, at least they skipped the pointless drama in the middle

31:18.820 --> 31:20.820
before they decided to get back together again, I guess.

31:21.820 --> 31:22.820
Can I borrow that?

31:23.820 --> 31:25.820
Yeah, because Maria took mine, you know.

31:26.820 --> 31:27.820
I already said yes, Joel.

31:30.820 --> 31:32.820
Couldn't you just give him his gun back?

31:33.820 --> 31:34.820
You have some ammo?

31:35.820 --> 31:36.820
Well, I guess five rounds is it.

31:36.820 --> 31:37.820
That's it.

31:42.820 --> 31:43.820
Four.

31:43.820 --> 31:44.820
Three.

31:44.820 --> 31:45.820
Two.

31:47.820 --> 31:48.820
You're flinching.

31:48.820 --> 31:49.820
The target's too small.

31:49.820 --> 31:50.820
I made it bigger than I should have.

31:50.820 --> 31:51.820
Eject the cartridge.

31:51.820 --> 31:52.820
I would assume they have more ammo than that.

31:53.820 --> 31:54.820
I'm not flinching.

31:55.820 --> 31:56.820
The rifle just sucks.

31:56.820 --> 31:57.820
Okay, give it.

31:59.820 --> 32:04.820
So, I know that they filmed a chunk of the show on the Canadian prairies in the spring.

32:04.820 --> 32:09.820
So, I think this is actually happening during Canadian spring.

32:10.820 --> 32:12.820
You gonna shoot this thing or get it pregnant?

32:14.820 --> 32:15.820
It isn't gonna work.

32:15.820 --> 32:16.820
It doesn't aim right.

32:18.820 --> 32:20.820
You dick.

32:23.820 --> 32:26.820
Now, he would have missed too because he shook the fuck out of that thing

32:26.820 --> 32:27.820
like he's scared of the recoil.

32:29.820 --> 32:32.820
There's enough snow like in the far background of these shots

32:32.820 --> 32:34.820
that I think this is actually...

32:35.820 --> 32:38.820
This is like March or April in Canada.

32:39.820 --> 32:40.820
Okay.

33:03.820 --> 33:04.820
That's right.

33:05.820 --> 33:06.820
Houses, stores, that kind of thing.

33:06.820 --> 33:09.820
You had the communists and the anarcho-capitalists.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.820
And that's all you had in America, apparently.

33:13.820 --> 33:14.820
According to him, yeah.

33:15.820 --> 33:17.820
He just wanted to grill.

33:17.820 --> 33:18.820
We were cool.

33:19.820 --> 33:20.820
Everybody loved contractors.

33:21.820 --> 33:22.820
Nice.

33:22.820 --> 33:25.820
Dude, people fucking hate contractors.

33:26.820 --> 33:27.820
Fuck.

33:29.820 --> 33:31.820
Well, I mean, get a good one.

33:31.820 --> 33:35.820
You hire a contractor 50-50 shot whether or not the job's gonna be done right.

33:35.820 --> 33:36.820
Or on time.

33:38.820 --> 33:41.820
Good contractor is much like good consultant.

33:42.820 --> 33:43.820
Pretty good.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.820
Or working communism.

33:46.820 --> 33:47.820
Fuck.

33:50.820 --> 33:53.820
Yeah, this shot has to be like Alberta or something.

33:53.820 --> 33:54.820
Basically.

33:55.820 --> 33:56.820
But violent.

33:59.820 --> 34:01.820
God, it's so flat it makes my cell hurt.

34:04.820 --> 34:05.820
True.

34:05.820 --> 34:07.820
But if you're driving down the Trans-Canada,

34:07.820 --> 34:10.820
you can go like 200 miles an hour and not hit anything.

34:11.820 --> 34:14.820
What, you mean to tell me the entire Canada is trans?

34:15.820 --> 34:16.820
Oh, God.

34:16.820 --> 34:17.820
God damn it.

34:17.820 --> 34:18.820
Reminds me of Denmark.

34:18.820 --> 34:19.820
The worst place on Earth.

34:21.820 --> 34:22.820
Denmark?

34:23.820 --> 34:25.820
It too is ungodly flat.

34:27.820 --> 34:28.820
Oh, wow.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.820
So I have to assume that like

34:35.820 --> 34:38.820
they modeled the university in the game after a real university

34:38.820 --> 34:40.820
because that's the university.

34:41.820 --> 34:42.820
It could be CGI.

34:43.820 --> 34:44.820
Yeah, that's true.

34:44.820 --> 34:46.820
Looks a bit CGI.

34:47.820 --> 34:50.820
Because I know that the university they used was, I think,

34:50.820 --> 34:52.820
was some historical university in...

34:55.820 --> 34:56.820
Looks exactly like the game, too.

34:56.820 --> 34:57.820
That's pretty incredible.

35:09.820 --> 35:12.820
To be fair, that's what I did my first time at university.

35:12.820 --> 35:15.820
I wasted like $50,000 on the university.

35:15.820 --> 35:17.820
$50,000 in fucking bullshit.

35:28.820 --> 35:33.820
The only thing I got out of it was a bunch of wasted money,

35:33.820 --> 35:35.820
a World of Warcraft habit,

35:35.820 --> 35:38.820
and I became a fucking communist for a few years.

35:39.820 --> 35:40.820
An actual communist this time, Arch.

35:40.820 --> 35:42.820
Not the fake one you always call me.

35:43.820 --> 35:44.820
And then you never stopped.

35:46.820 --> 35:47.820
Fair enough.

35:47.820 --> 35:48.820
Are those monkeys?

35:49.820 --> 35:50.820
Must be from the old labs.

35:52.820 --> 35:53.820
First time seeing a monkey.

35:55.820 --> 35:56.820
Return the monkey.

35:58.820 --> 35:59.820
Ah, yes. Canada.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.820
It's a remarkably friendly place for monkeys.

36:03.820 --> 36:04.820
Yeah, time to the tree, man.

36:05.820 --> 36:06.820
Or at least the bike rack.

36:07.820 --> 36:11.820
I do recall reading about one kid who went to university on a horse every day

36:11.820 --> 36:13.820
and he actually did tie his horse to the bike rack.

36:15.820 --> 36:18.820
So this campus actually isn't the post-apocalypse.

36:18.820 --> 36:20.820
It's just after Milo Yiannopoulos gave a speech.

36:25.820 --> 36:28.820
Makes me feel old just to hear that reference.

36:30.820 --> 36:32.820
Listen, if there's infected up there,

36:32.820 --> 36:35.820
the best thing to do is to shout and stand in the light.

36:38.820 --> 36:40.820
So at least you have an advantage if they come down.

36:41.820 --> 36:44.820
Yeah, but there's not enough time left in the episode to get into any action,

36:44.820 --> 36:47.820
so they're gonna have to just find some random dude who stayed behind.

36:48.820 --> 36:50.820
So they can kill him in the next episode.

36:52.820 --> 36:55.820
Oh wow, you're right. This episode, like, flew by.

36:56.820 --> 36:57.820
Yep, it's almost over.

37:05.820 --> 37:06.820
Ah, sort of a person.

37:11.820 --> 37:12.820
That was the fake-out.

37:13.820 --> 37:14.820
Well, at least it ain't clickers.

37:21.820 --> 37:22.820
Oh no, it's a band of Negan's.

37:26.820 --> 37:27.820
Yeah, put that away.

37:28.820 --> 37:29.820
Probably not gonna be here.

37:41.820 --> 37:46.820
Listen, he's old and weak, that's why he just snapped that grown man's neck

37:46.820 --> 37:48.820
like it was a piece of fucking crinkle bar.

37:50.820 --> 37:53.820
Look, he does that, like, 50 times in a game, okay?

37:53.820 --> 37:54.820
Oh no.

37:55.820 --> 37:56.820
Okay, when did that happen?

37:57.820 --> 37:58.820
Don't pull it out.

37:58.820 --> 37:59.820
You idiot!

37:59.820 --> 38:00.820
I thought that was foolish.

38:01.820 --> 38:04.820
Like, you can still ride back to the town.

38:10.820 --> 38:17.820
You know, Ellie, this would be a perfect opportunity to just shoot him.

38:22.820 --> 38:24.820
Or just, you know, do that.

38:25.820 --> 38:26.820
And now he's leaking.

38:38.820 --> 38:39.820
Remember, children,

38:39.820 --> 38:43.820
if something is keeping your blood inside of you, don't remove it.

38:44.820 --> 38:46.820
What the fuck is up with that horse's leg?

38:49.820 --> 38:51.820
What the fuck is up with that horse's leg?

38:52.820 --> 38:53.820
It's kinda bent, eh?

38:54.820 --> 38:56.820
No, the other leg. The other leg is dead straight.

38:57.820 --> 38:58.820
Yeah.

38:58.820 --> 39:00.820
Well, it's almost like that's his tail.

39:01.820 --> 39:03.820
Which is giving it a little bit of optical illusion.

39:04.820 --> 39:05.820
Yeah, I'm starting to wonder, like, what?

39:06.820 --> 39:09.820
Yep, I saw that too, and I was like, is this a bugged-out video game or something?

39:12.820 --> 39:13.820
So, there we go.

39:13.820 --> 39:14.820
Well, there you go.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.820
Joel's gonna die.

39:16.820 --> 39:19.820
I mean, he won't be saved by some random passerby.

39:19.820 --> 39:23.820
Doesn't matter, he's gonna get golf-clubbed anyways. Nothing matters.

39:24.820 --> 39:25.820
Nihilist, Kibbs.

39:26.820 --> 39:27.820
It's all over.

39:27.820 --> 39:28.820
It's all over.

39:29.820 --> 39:34.820
So, everything about this episode was game-accurate.

39:35.820 --> 39:40.820
Except, one, they made the town look more like its Last of Us 2 incarnation than Last of Us 1.

39:41.820 --> 39:46.820
Two, they added the woman who's presumably going to become Ellie's girlfriend later, looked just like her.

39:47.820 --> 39:56.820
And three, that extra scene with Joel and Tommy having that heart-to-heart where he talks about having panic attacks.

39:56.820 --> 40:02.820
And I think that was probably the scene that, you know, ruined the episode for me, I would say.

40:03.820 --> 40:06.820
Because it ruined the impact of the Joel and Ellie conversation.

40:07.820 --> 40:08.820
I think that's an accurate assessment.

40:09.820 --> 40:13.820
It changes the chemistry between Joel and Ellie a lot this episode.

40:14.820 --> 40:19.820
And it changes the focus too, which I think is, I think long-term, I think that's detriment.

40:20.820 --> 40:24.820
I know, Lilith, you were devil's advocating the other side. Is that how you actually feel?

40:24.820 --> 40:30.820
I don't know if it necessarily destroys the dynamic, personally.

40:31.820 --> 40:43.820
I think for the viewers, it probably builds it up a bit so it doesn't come across as jarring, that Joel feels like has those PTSD moments, I guess.

40:44.820 --> 40:46.820
The thing is, I think jarring was the point of that.

40:46.820 --> 40:54.820
The character who has been a cliff, a rock up until this point, suddenly shows a point of humanity and weakness.

40:55.820 --> 41:00.820
If he's suddenly bawling over and having bitch fates in the middle of nowhere, that kind of undermines the character.

41:01.820 --> 41:07.820
It's not out of nowhere. In the context of the story, it's just a few moments before the scene was-

41:08.820 --> 41:11.820
A few moments of being a bitch before he actually has emotions.

41:11.820 --> 41:17.820
Again, that's the thing. His character is supposed to be that of the rock, the tough guy.

41:18.820 --> 41:21.820
And having that break down for even a moment is a big deal.

41:22.820 --> 41:26.820
But if it breaks down like five times in the same episode, it's no longer a big deal.

41:27.820 --> 41:37.820
Well, it's also that at this point in the game, the facade of this just being a job has been consistently maintained the whole time.

41:37.820 --> 41:43.820
And this is the moment where it breaks just for a second. Here, Arch, you haven't seen the scene, I'm gonna share it with you.

41:44.820 --> 41:47.820
It's a two minute scene, it's not a big deal. Just so you know what's going on, okay?

42:07.820 --> 42:08.820
Did you say no?

42:10.820 --> 42:18.820
Do you even realize what your life means? Huh? Running off like that, putting yourself at risk? It's pretty goddamn stupid.

42:19.820 --> 42:21.820
Well, I guess we're both disappointed with each other then.

42:22.820 --> 42:23.820
What do you want from me?

42:24.820 --> 42:26.820
Admit that you wanted to get rid of me the whole time.

42:29.820 --> 42:30.820
Tommy knows this area better than-

42:30.820 --> 42:31.820
Oh fuck!

42:32.820 --> 42:34.820
Well, I'm sorry. I trust him better than I trust myself.

42:34.820 --> 42:43.820
Stop with the bullshit! What are you so afraid of? That I'm gonna end up like Sam? I can't get infected! I can take care of myself!

42:43.820 --> 42:45.820
How many close calls have we had?

42:45.820 --> 42:47.820
Well, we seem to be doing alright so far.

42:47.820 --> 42:49.820
And now you'll be doing even better with Tommy!

42:54.820 --> 42:55.820
I'm not her, you know.

42:55.820 --> 42:56.820
What?

42:57.820 --> 42:58.820
Maria told me about Sarah and-

42:58.820 --> 42:59.820
Ellie!

42:59.820 --> 43:00.820
And-

43:02.820 --> 43:05.820
You are treading on some mighty thin ice here.

43:06.820 --> 43:10.820
I'm sorry about your daughter, Joel. But I have lost people too.

43:10.820 --> 43:13.820
You have no idea what loss is.

43:15.820 --> 43:19.820
Everyone I have cared for has either died or left me.

43:21.820 --> 43:23.820
Everyone except for you!

43:23.820 --> 43:30.820
So don't tell me that I would be safer with someone else because the truth is I would just be more scared.

43:35.820 --> 43:36.820
You're right.

43:38.820 --> 43:39.820
You're not my daughter.

43:42.820 --> 43:44.820
And I sure as hell ain't your dad.

43:46.820 --> 43:47.820
And we are going our separate ways.

43:48.820 --> 43:50.820
Get it together! We're not alone.

43:51.820 --> 43:54.820
Oh yeah, also a fight scene happens right after because it's a video game, right?

43:55.820 --> 44:06.820
But the point of the scene is rather than relying on Joel's insecurity about his own abilities and his aging and his panic attacks and all of this,

44:06.820 --> 44:16.820
he maintains the facade that it is just about the job and about who is going to do the job better right up until Ellie mentions his daughter.

44:16.820 --> 44:19.820
And that's the one moment where we realize that it's actually not about that at all.

44:20.820 --> 44:29.820
And I think that this moment is undermined when you have that big talk between the two brothers in the previous scene.

44:30.820 --> 44:36.820
I can see your perspective. The impact seems to be a little bit softened because of that scene.

44:37.820 --> 44:43.820
And considering that this is I think probably the fan's favorite scene of the entire game is this moment,

44:43.820 --> 44:49.820
I think it's kind of a big deal, at least if you're like a die-hard Last of Us fan, to see it ruined a bit.

44:50.820 --> 44:56.820
Just because they wanted to, I don't know, do a very special episode about mental health with Joel. I don't fucking know.

44:57.820 --> 45:00.820
I feel like you're getting old. Joel feels like he's getting old.

45:01.820 --> 45:10.820
It's very obvious in the television show they are currently doing their best to make sure that Joel is not, well, tough.

45:10.820 --> 45:14.820
They are undermining his tough guy character because up until this point he's been a tough guy.

45:15.820 --> 45:18.820
And he's been competent and he's done well for himself and he's kept Ellie safe.

45:19.820 --> 45:24.820
Now he has panic attacks. He needs to lean over and touch grass occasionally.

45:25.820 --> 45:29.820
He's worried about his age and he can't do anything and then he gets stabbed in the gut by a baseball bat somehow.

45:30.820 --> 45:33.820
I already watched that fight scene. He did not have an opportunity to stab them there.

45:34.820 --> 45:35.820
Now it's just posted.

45:35.820 --> 45:39.820
I knew it. I knew that's what I think. I was like, I just don't see it.

45:40.820 --> 45:43.820
Yeah, no, he did not have an opportunity to get a stab in on him there.

45:44.820 --> 45:47.820
That was one of those shock value, like he got stabbed scenes.

45:48.820 --> 45:56.820
The fight was way too goddamn short. There was only one moment in which he could potentially have done it, but his grip was all wrong.

45:57.820 --> 46:00.820
He was holding onto the jagged end. There's no way he stabbed it in that deep.

46:01.820 --> 46:03.820
How did it happen in the game?

46:03.820 --> 46:13.820
Oh, you know what it is? No, he didn't get stabbed. He fell off of a railing in the university and got impaled on something.

46:14.820 --> 46:22.820
There's an extended scene where you're fighting with blurry vision and you're stuck to the ground while Ellie has to pry you up and you're shooting guys that are running at you.

46:23.820 --> 46:27.820
Yeah, that's right. That's what this was. And that's why he had to pull it out because he was stuck to the ground. He just had to get up.

46:27.820 --> 46:32.820
But, I mean, all the other moments were pretty much identical. All the other beats were pretty much the same.

46:33.820 --> 46:42.820
Things seemed okay in the show. And you know what? They still tugged at all the right heart strings. I'm sure Twitter is blowing up about it.

46:43.820 --> 46:47.820
They probably love it over there. But if you're a purist, I don't think you'll like this episode.

46:48.820 --> 46:53.820
That's my final take on it. If any of you guys want to add a little bit more.

46:54.820 --> 46:55.820
That's true, sir.

46:55.820 --> 46:58.820
I'm kind of on the same page as you, honestly, when it comes to the episode.

46:59.820 --> 47:02.820
Alright. Take care, everybody.

47:03.820 --> 47:07.820
Little's like, I gotta go eat some fucking meatloaf. I'm done.

47:08.820 --> 47:09.820
Food time.
