1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
So, it turns out that Lilith is late because she's making a meatloaf.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,680
Yes.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,680
I mean, I don't really blame Lilith.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,840
I mean, that's infinitely more interesting than a TV show, so.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,840
Meatloaf sounds tasty.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,840
Thank you.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,840
I'm glad you understand.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,840
Meatloaf is great.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,840
It takes priority.

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,720
I thought it would be done earlier, but I guess the slab of meat I was working with

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,560
today was bigger than the one I was working with last time, so.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,560
I gotta be honest.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,120
I've actually cooked a meatloaf before.

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Oh, it's super easy.

15
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
Oh, yeah?

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,920
You just cut it up, season it a bunch, put it on a metal plate, and put it in nothing.

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,680
Do you stuff it with veggies?

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Do you put like- No.

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,680
No?

20
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,200
When I make homemade burgers, what I'll do is I'll stuff the meat with garlic, with onions,

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
and with chopped kale.

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Oh, you can do that.

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
You can do that, definitely.

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,800
Lots of people like to rub garlic into it.

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,160
If I had garlic, I would have done that, but I didn't, so I just used garlic salt today.

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Right, right.

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,160
What you should be doing is you should be baking in egg and cheese.

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
Oh.

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,160
I've heard a lot about putting eggs in instead of breadcrumbs to find their meat together.

30
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,160
I did add a little bit of cheese on mine.

31
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
Yeah.

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,520
Yeah, the egg is an interesting solution to bread, or alternative.

33
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,520
So what do you do with the egg?

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,720
Basically, when you have the- you take the meatloaf first, and instead of making it into

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,280
the loaf, you have all the ground meat out in a long platter kind of thing.

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Uh-huh.

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,120
Then you take the egg, you beat it up a little bit so it's nice and yellow and consistent

38
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,880
up, kind of like you're making omelet, and then you just pour that on the center, and

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,920
then you roll the meatloaf over it, and then you pack it in on both sides, so it's kind

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,360
of in the center of the meatloaf, and then you roast as usual.

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Nice.

42
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
Okay.

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,200
Now this, you do need to cut into it to make sure that it's cooked on the inside, because

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,080
if it isn't cooked through, you're going to have raw egg inside of your meat, and that's

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
a problem.

46
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Yeah.

47
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Yeah, but like Sunnyside D.

48
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:08,080
But it is actually quite delicious, and it's- if you cool it down, it's eatable, it's almost

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
just like spread.

50
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,280
You slice off a thin piece, put it on bread, and eat.

51
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,160
So we're back together again to watch The Last of Us.

52
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,680
You know, when we were watching The Rings of Power, even though it was really, really

53
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,960
bad, it was kind of like a momentous occasion, you know, because Lord of the Rings is a much

54
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,100
bigger property than The Last of Us, and Rings of Power was a much bigger shitshow than this

55
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,720
show was turning out to be.

56
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,900
I don't know how I feel about watching a good show on my channel, or at least like a passing

57
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,280
show on my channel, you know?

58
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,600
Yeah, better stop then, because we're just development.

59
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
That's what we'll do.

60
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
I have to hate watch.

61
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,880
It could be better, because that's the thing, this is a passing show, but it's no Spartacus,

62
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,280
it's no Rome.

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,040
It's no the first few seasons of Game of Thrones, you know?

64
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,120
Game of Thrones, sub-tier to Rome.

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,920
And man, you know what, speaking of just passable shows, I watched season 3 episode 1 of Picard,

66
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,760
and I was surprised that it was mediocre, because Picard has been the worst show I've

67
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,240
ever seen in my fucking life for two seasons, and it's bumped up massively to just being

68
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,600
normal bad.

69
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,320
I tried to get into the Trek of the Stars, and I did so by trying to watch Picard.

70
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,600
So I'm like, yeah, I'll get in on the ground floor of this, let's see what everybody's

71
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
talking about.

72
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,640
I watched the first episode, and I was like, well, time's wrong again.

73
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
This is shit.

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,760
You start, hold on, your first episode of Star Trek-

75
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,260
That's probably not the best place to start.

76
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,840
Your first episode of Star Trek was the worst show of all time?

77
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,780
Actually, to be fair, my first proper Star Trek that I watched was STD, which I kind

78
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,140
of enjoyed, because it was just a stupid action show.

79
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,460
Oh, god damn it.

80
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,180
Go back and watch the good stuff, go back and watch TNG and DS9.

81
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,660
He doesn't like it.

82
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,180
He did try to give DS9 a swing, which I'll give him credit for that, but sadly it didn't

83
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,160
stick with him, which breaks my heart.

84
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,460
So when I started dating Naomi, Naomi's a Zoomer, she's younger than me, so I'm a millennial,

85
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,820
and she hadn't ever seen anything about Star Trek before.

86
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,820
Age gap.

87
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,820
That makes you a pedophile.

88
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
I'm gonna get cancelled for the age gap, yeah.

89
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,700
I'm gonna get cancelled by all the TikTok Zoomers.

90
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,780
So I sat down with her and I'm like, listen, Naomi, we're watching every single piece of

91
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,420
Star Trek in order of release, and we went through the whole thing.

92
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,700
We went through, we did the original series from 1967 or whatever, we did the animated

93
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,540
series, we did the movies, we did TNG, DS9, Voyager, we did all of it.

94
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:39,500
And she became a Star Trek hyper fan just in time to be let down by all the new Trek.

95
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,260
It's tragic, but that's actually kind of where I'm at with that, too, because I didn't

96
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,260
find-

97
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,260
Well, what's her favorite character?

98
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,260
Her favorite character?

99
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,260
Yeah.

100
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,260
Oh, Jesus.

101
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,260
That's gonna be a hard one, too.

102
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Actually, I don't know what her favorite character would be.

103
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,260
Naomi, what is your favorite Star Trek character of all time?

104
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,260
Of all time?

105
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,260
Yeah.

106
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,260
I can't pick just one.

107
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,260
Come on, pick one.

108
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,260
Yeah, see?

109
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,260
That's a hard question.

110
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,100
Yeah, I knew it would be.

111
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,300
One of the entire franchise.

112
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Oof.

113
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,300
I don't know.

114
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,300
Odo's pretty close.

115
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
I mean-

116
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,300
Odo?

117
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Yeah.

118
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,300
I like Odo.

119
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,300
I could pick.

120
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
I can't pick one.

121
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
Can you pick one for each show?

122
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Like, original series?

123
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Original series is Spock.

124
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Yes, of course.

125
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,300
And then TNG is...

126
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,300
Was obviously Picard.

127
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,300
But he was ruined by Picard.

128
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,300
Yeah.

129
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Well, you know what?

130
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,300
We're not talking about Picard.

131
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:34,300
We're talking about the character of Picard in TNG where he was good.

132
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,300
Okay?

133
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,620
Well, to be fair, Picard also ruined Data.

134
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,620
So you can't even fall back on that.

135
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,620
Yeah, exactly.

136
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,620
Yeah.

137
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,620
So...

138
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,620
Odo and DS9, obviously.

139
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,620
DS9 was...

140
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,620
Yeah.

141
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,620
Odo for DS9.

142
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,620
Voyager?

143
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,620
Then Voyager...

144
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,620
Probably Seven of Nine, realistically.

145
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,620
Is that just because she's not-

146
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,620
No.

147
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,620
I like her character arc.

148
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,620
Oh, yeah.

149
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:01,260
She has lots of arcs going all over her body, I know.

150
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,620
I can tell based on your face that's what you were thinking of, too.

151
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,620
No, it wasn't.

152
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,620
All right.

153
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,620
You know me.

154
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,620
You're abandoned.

155
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,620
Dev.

156
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,620
Yes?

157
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,620
It's EMH.

158
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,420
The EMH Doctor is the best character in Voyager.

159
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,420
Not Seven of Nine.

160
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,820
You have to break up with him.

161
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,620
The EMH is actually an interesting character.

162
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
Yeah, the Doctor.

163
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,460
He's a great actor, and he's an opera singer, too, if I remember right.

164
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,980
There's one final thing I must confirm.

165
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,980
Okay.

166
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,980
What's up?

167
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,980
Naomi.

168
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,980
Dev.

169
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,980
Okay.

170
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,980
Your Enterprise character was T'Pol, right?

171
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,980
Oh, fuck.

172
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,980
The Enterprise.

173
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,340
Yeah, it's because of the curves.

174
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
I know.

175
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
Thank you.

176
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,340
All right.

177
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,480
Enterprise doesn't count.

178
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,180
It's been a long time.

179
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,180
I hate that intro.

180
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,820
I think we've sexually shamed Naomi enough for liking hot TV women.

181
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,340
Should we watch the zombie show now?

182
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,820
I mean, I guess we can.

183
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,820
I think it's time.

184
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,820
I think it's time.

185
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,820
We can commence.

186
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,700
Oh, I put mushrooms sometimes in my burgers, too.

187
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,100
Just chop them up like little tiny mushroom chops.

188
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,100
Little pieces and put them in the burgers.

189
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Yeah.

190
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,220
Give me a gun.

191
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,220
Oh, shit.

192
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,220
I gotta turn on subtitles.

193
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,220
Give me a gun.

194
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,220
Whoops.

195
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,220
Henry, no!

196
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,220
By a black person.

197
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,220
Leading cause of death in America.

198
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,220
Wow.

199
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,220
Black person.

200
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,620
His arch celebrates.

201
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,020
That is very arch.

202
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,020
Ah.

203
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,020
Home.

204
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,140
Actually, it's a bit too flat to be home.

205
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:36,020
You always realized they're not doing the four seasons thing that Last of Us did.

206
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,740
Do you remember that, Lilith and Kibs?

207
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,740
Oh, yeah.

208
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
They went through the seasons.

209
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,740
Yeah.

210
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,740
They divided the game into quarters based on the season.

211
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,740
Motherfucker.

212
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,740
That's impressive.

213
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:54,220
Oh, this is going to be nine episodes, right?

214
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,220
Miniseries?

215
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,220
Nine or ten?

216
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,220
Oh, God.

217
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,220
Wow.

218
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:04,220
You've, uh, you've lived through the apocalypse well, honey.

219
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,340
Not bad.

220
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,020
You must be a very good hunter.

221
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,020
Who the hell are you?

222
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,620
There's someone passing through.

223
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,620
Take the gun out.

224
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,620
Two fingers only.

225
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,620
Put it out of reach.

226
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,620
Why did you shoot him?

227
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,620
The gun's all the way over there.

228
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,020
He didn't hurt me, by the way.

229
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,020
He's got a girl with him.

230
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,020
Can I con-jow?

231
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,020
No.

232
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,020
Henry.

233
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
What did I just say?

234
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,820
Joel, come on.

235
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,820
There's like a thousand.

236
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,820
Who's this little psycho?

237
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,820
Never mind her.

238
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,820
I need you to tell us where we are.

239
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,820
You got a map?

240
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,820
Why you lost?

241
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,820
You must have missed all the street signs in the enormous fucking forest.

242
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,820
Holy.

243
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,820
I like how they're just laughing at her.

244
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Exactly where?

245
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
And your answer better be the same as your wife's.

246
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Did you tell them the truth?

247
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,820
Yeah.

248
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,820
Are you telling me the truth?

249
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,820
Yeah.

250
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,620
What about the fireflies?

251
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,620
We get those in the summer.

252
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,620
Not the bugs.

253
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,620
The people.

254
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,620
There are firefly people?

255
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,620
Oh my god.

256
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,620
You got any advice on the best way to...

257
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,620
What are the best characters so far?

258
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,620
Gooey.

259
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:25,520
So having had a bunch of experience with like native people living on reservations in Canada,

260
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,220
they are exactly like this.

261
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,220
Don't give a fuck.

262
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,220
Just relax and chillin' out.

263
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Put that back.

264
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,620
I don't know anything.

265
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,620
You're stealing a rabbit.

266
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,620
Joel?

267
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,620
Joel?

268
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,620
Joel, are you okay?

269
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,620
Joel?

270
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,620
Shut up.

271
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,620
Holy shit.

272
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
Are you dying?

273
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
I'm okay.

274
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
I'm okay.

275
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
I'm okay.

276
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,620
I'm fine.

277
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,620
No, no.

278
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,620
But are you?

279
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
Because just to remind you that you're dead.

280
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,620
I'm fucked.

281
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,620
I'm fine.

282
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,620
Okay.

283
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,620
It's just the cold air.

284
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,020
Oh, I saw you.

285
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,020
I think this is new.

286
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,020
I don't recall Joel having an old man sickness.

287
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,020
Yeah, I've been hearing something that they hinted at in the beginning episode.

288
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,020
That's new information, or made up information, whatever you want to call it.

289
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,820
If they're smart, they'll kill his ass via natural causes instead of the way he went

290
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,820
in that other game.

291
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,820
The unceremonious death by fucking golf club.

292
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,820
Uh huh.

293
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
Fuck.

294
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,820
And then they try to get you to sympathize with the character that killed him.

295
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,820
Yep.

296
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Mm-hmm.

297
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,820
That didn't work out so well.

298
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Don't be like that very much.

299
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,820
Close the dark.

300
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,820
No, nobody did.

301
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,820
There's some caves along the river.

302
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
We'll set up camp there, cross in the morning.

303
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
Yeah, it's a better way for him to go.

304
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,820
Just keep moving.

305
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
One could be so lucky.

306
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
That rabbit is so fucking fake, by the way.

307
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Oh yeah.

308
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
Yep.

309
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
That's too big to be like a...

310
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,820
Well the eyes of a woman.

311
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,260
That size isn't necessarily wrong.

312
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,820
What gives it away is that thing is still flopping.

313
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:08,820
It's been dead for hours, it should be stiff as a board.

314
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,820
Can I have some?

315
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,820
No.

316
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,820
What, just to warm up?

317
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,220
Unscientific fact, alcohol does not actually make you warmer.

318
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,820
Nope, it just makes you numb.

319
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
Cough, cough, cough.

320
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,820
Yep.

321
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,820
So gross.

322
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
You know, I'm a grown man at this point.

323
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
I still don't like the taste of hard liquor.

324
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
I don't think anybody does.

325
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
It's fucking awful.

326
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
I would raise sheep.

327
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
They're quiet.

328
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
Do what they're told.

329
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
Actually, no.

330
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Not in the slightest.

331
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
They're snarky as fuck.

332
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
They haven't been around sheeps, they're not quiet.

333
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,820
Nor do they do what they're told.

334
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,820
They're disobedient little shits.

335
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,820
What about you, where are you gonna go?

336
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,820
He's gonna be a sheep fucker.

337
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,820
Look at all that meat left on that poor rabbit.

338
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,820
Yeah, it's just grilling there.

339
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
They couldn't have been very hungry, I guess.

340
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,820
Yeah.

341
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
They've been doing pretty well with the journey, I guess.

342
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
No fetish in the morning.

343
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,820
What can I say, man?

344
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
I'm a natural.

345
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,820
What amazes me is that's a grown woman and that rifle still looks like it'll bowl her

346
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
over if she fired it.

347
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
Yeah.

348
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,820
She looks like a grown woman the same way that Greta Thunberg now looks like a grown woman.

349
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
Like, I know she's 18.

350
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,820
Yeah, well, she's 18, but she's tiny as fuck, you know?

351
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:41,820
And her parents specifically dress and groom her to look like a fucking 10-year-old.

352
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
When you say groom in the context of Greta Thunberg, it just sounds bad.

353
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Well, I mean it in both contexts in this case.

354
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Oh, no.

355
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
Fine.

356
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Ah, yes, fire your gun and then wait for about five seconds.

357
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
Then walk out of cover.

358
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
That's pretty smart.

359
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,820
I'm sure anyone watching would have given up after the first three.

360
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
Actually, Arch, it's not just her parents.

361
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,820
Did you see that there were some...

362
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,820
I think they were rhinoids because they were coming at it from an anti-environmentalist perspective,

363
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,820
but they were talking about how now that Greta Thunberg is 18, she's certain OnlyFans.

364
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,820
I'm like, Jesus, guys. Calm the fuck down with that.

365
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
What?

366
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,820
I'm assuming how she's been raised for quite enough time, I think.

367
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,820
I just imagine a chick that has been repressed that hard by her parents and controlled that hard for this long.

368
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Oh, there's going to be some behaviour there.

369
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
Oh, like going off to a party at university or something?

370
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,820
You don't know how to whistle?

371
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
Does it sound like I know how to whistle?

372
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
No.

373
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,820
Seriously, though, how the fuck do you do that?

374
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,820
Tyler.

375
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,820
Whatever.

376
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
You should teach me how to hunt.

377
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,820
Oh.

378
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
That's such a wise answer.

379
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,820
Tyler is genuinely actually pretty good at their interactions.

380
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,820
Yeah, they're getting there for sure.

381
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Damn.

382
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Correct.

383
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
You know Will Livingston.

384
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,820
Yeah, but who is?

385
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
So that made electricity?

386
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,820
Yeah. Don't ask me. I don't have a clue.

387
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,820
I mean, theoretically, it still should. A hydroelectric dam doesn't require a lot of maintenance, but...

388
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,820
Oh, no.

389
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,820
Oh, look, another group of outlaws with a female leader.

390
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
How about you shut the fuck up?

391
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,820
OK. Easy.

392
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,820
They do say women are the future.

393
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,820
They're apparently correct.

394
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
Last chance for a bullet.

395
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,820
But you've earned the fact that he will smell it and he will rip you up.

396
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
Oh, shit.

397
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Now her.

398
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
Oh.

399
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,820
That's lucky.

400
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,820
What's her name?

401
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
There's the leader. Like barge called...

402
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,820
Oh, dang.

403
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,820
Oh, obviously.

404
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,820
I guess the smart thing is to build your new town somewhere else, since all the old ones are too infected.

405
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,820
Oh, yeah. Away from civilization.

406
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,820
Rather than doing QZs, like Fedra did.

407
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:54,820
Yeah, then you scatter fake powder snow on it, which is just white sand.

408
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
And voila! Home.

409
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:05,820
I hate how all of these shows are... shows snow. I hate video game snow.

410
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
Nobody gets snow right.

411
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
Yeah.

412
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,820
You know, my front yard currently has like ten feet of snow in it.

413
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,820
You gotta learn how to do snow, guys.

414
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
I came here to save you.

415
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Are these the good guys?

416
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
Oh, they've got electricity. That's nice.

417
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,820
Oh, they took the look of this place from the second game.

418
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,820
There's more if you need it.

419
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,820
Unfortunately.

420
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,820
Thank you, ma'am.

421
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Yes, this is the second game settlement where they settle down.

422
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Oh.

423
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Kevs, did you recognize?

424
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
Was that the Jewish lady?

425
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,820
That looks like her girlfriend in the second game.

426
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
Ah, cringe.

427
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,820
I hate this show now.

428
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,820
They're bringing in like second season stuff or something.

429
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
I hope they never get a second season.

430
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,820
Maria is family, actually.

431
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
Oh, shit. Congrats.

432
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,820
Joel, say congrats.

433
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,820
Congrats.

434
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
House of Worship. Multifaith.

435
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
School. Laundry.

436
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,820
O Bank works as the J on that we've muted.

437
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,820
You draw power from a dam.

438
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Got that working a couple of years ago.

439
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,820
Nice.

440
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,820
And they're sheeps.

441
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,820
Oh, boys.

442
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,820
Of course.

443
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,820
The commune.

444
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,820
They're democratically elected.

445
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,820
Hunting.

446
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
It's The Last of Us Part Two.

447
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,820
Greenhouses, livestock.

448
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,820
All shared.

449
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
Nope.

450
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,820
Communes.

451
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,820
It is a commune.

452
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,820
Communism.

453
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,820
Yes.

454
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,820
Oh.

455
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
It ain't like that.

456
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
It is that.

457
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
Literally.

458
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,820
This is a commune.

459
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
We're communists.

460
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Oh, OK.

461
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
No way.

462
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
That's our newest one.

463
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,820
Couple months old.

464
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
You want a pet?

465
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
Oh, there you go.

466
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,820
All you need for communism to succeed is the death of 99% of the population.

467
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,820
99% of humanity and collapse of civilization.

468
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,820
A small, vacated, armed commune.

469
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Not to mention, you know, a rider to shoehorn everything to work.

470
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,820
This actually makes sense because this is how the Zapatistas run things in Mexico.

471
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:41,820
They live in one of the poorest, most dysfunctional, most undeveloped places in the entire world, even including Africa.

472
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:49,820
And the only way they, like, basically the social organization that communism brought them actually advanced them.

473
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,820
But only because they had literally nothing.

474
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,820
And some organization, even bad organization, is better than nothing.

475
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
You on the other hand.

476
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,820
Yep.

477
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,820
Literally, when the world is a zombie apocalypse, communism might be a valley sculpture.

478
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,820
So how's Tess?

479
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,820
Dead.

480
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,820
She's fine.

481
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,820
So you know where they might be?

482
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,820
These fireflies?

483
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,820
They got a base down at the University of Eastern Colorado.

484
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,820
It's a week's ride south.

485
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,820
I continue to be impressed by the fact that they still have alcohol after the last, like, 20-odd years.

486
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,820
I'm not sure how much they'd be drinking it.

487
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,820
Maybe they're making some now.

488
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,820
I could make moonshine.

489
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,820
Yeah, you could just make some.

490
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,820
That doesn't look like much.

491
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,820
I'm not sure.

492
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Is Joel gonna be bitter about it?

493
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,820
Yep. That's what it is.

494
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,820
Is that a cool Christmas thing going on?

495
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,820
How nice.

496
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
You really shouldn't be doing that.

497
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,820
Resist the urge to lick the pole, Joel.

498
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,820
Joel, get stuck there, and this'll turn into the comedy.

499
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,820
Yep.

500
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:34,820
Remember, kids, do not touch metal in winter with exposed palms or tongues. Bad idea.

501
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,820
Uh, he's seeing her.

502
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,820
It's hair product, by the way. She probably was able to maintain that.

503
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,820
Yeah.

504
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,820
They're also manufacturing that, too.

505
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:53,820
If ancient Egyptians can make hair product, then why can't you make it in a post office?

506
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,820
Hmm.

507
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:03,820
Because modern day people don't know how to grow fucking carrots, much less make horse products.

508
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,820
Yeah, there we go. Horse products.

509
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
Wait, I'm across the street.

510
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,820
Oh, are they gonna start the romance early?

511
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,820
Uh, cringe.

512
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
Oh.

513
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,820
Gross.

514
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,820
20 year old period cup. Jesus. There's no way it still works. It'd be crinkling.

515
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,820
Also, sadly, it's not one of those anti-rape ones.

516
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
Oh, with the hooks?

517
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,820
Teeth inside.

518
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,820
Hello?

519
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,820
Wait, is everyone's door just open in the commune?

520
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,820
Of course. It's real communism, Kev.

521
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,820
Kibs? Dev? I don't even know who you are anymore.

522
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,820
Don't fucking mistake me for Dev, you son of a bitch.

523
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,820
Wait, look at the house.

524
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,820
It's pristine.

525
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:55,820
No, I think it's the same house as...

526
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,820
Yeah, this is... most of this is Last of Us Part 2 stuff.

527
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,820
Well, no, no, no. It's the same house as Bill's house. They just changed the furniture.

528
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,820
No. No.

529
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,820
I think so.

530
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,820
Dev, you're fucking high, Dev.

531
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,820
This is where the, um, the dining room was.

532
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,820
No, it wasn't.

533
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,820
It wouldn't do that.

534
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,820
Dev, you're high.

535
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,820
Dev, sit.

536
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,820
I think it is.

537
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:28,820
Like, they have all this budget for all these locations, and you think they would have to reuse the house.

538
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,820
I was an assistant district attorney out of Omaha, Nebraska.

539
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,820
I put bad guys in jail.

540
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
Oh, cool, I guess.

541
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,820
Oh, how about Harris?

542
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,820
Hahaha.

543
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,820
Hahaha.

544
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,820
So that conversation is...

545
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,820
It was different, but it was close enough to what they did in the game.

546
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,820
This is the most fucking abundant post-apocalypse I think I've ever seen.

547
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
Haha, yep.

548
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,820
No, it's communism. You know, it's golden.

549
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,820
Yeah, okay.

550
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,820
I think within the lore, it's explained in some places that have more warning than others.

551
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,820
She's in...

552
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,820
Tongues, actually.

553
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,820
Haha, yeah.

554
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,820
Because I was too slow and too fucking deaf to hear him coming.

555
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,820
I was so afraid.

556
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,820
You think I can still handle things, but I'm not who I was.

557
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,820
I'm weak.

558
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:50,820
Lately, there are these moments where the fear comes up out of nowhere, and my heart feels like it stopped.

559
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,820
Yeah, this is all new. He didn't have this in, like, panic attacks. He didn't have these in the original game.

560
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,820
You know, you just slaughtered people wholesale.

561
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,820
Sudden onset pussy-itis.

562
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
Haha, unfortunate, but yes.

563
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,820
A common affliction in this day and age among straight men.

564
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,820
I've lost something.

565
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,820
I'm failing in my sleep.

566
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,820
It's all I do.

567
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,820
It's all I've ever done.

568
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,820
I remember Joel being, like, a defeatist.

569
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,820
He had his moments, for sure.

570
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,820
Just a few minutes ago, the show told us that you can't trust anybody.

571
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,820
Because the only people you can betray are the people you trust.

572
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,820
I wonder what's gonna happen next.

573
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,820
No locks.

574
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,820
Nowhere. They've been outlawed.

575
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,820
Oh man, look at that old-school Mac!

576
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,820
In communism, you must trust your neighbor.

577
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,820
What exactly did you hear?

578
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,820
I have to leave her. You have to take her.

579
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,820
You know, I stood up for you today because I thought...

580
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,820
I made this decision for your own good.

581
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,820
You'll be way better off with Tommy.

582
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,820
He knows the area better than I do.

583
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,820
Do you give a shit about me or not?

584
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,820
Then what are you so afraid of?

585
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,820
I'm not her, you know.

586
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,820
Maria told me about Sarah and...

587
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,820
No.

588
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,820
Don't say another word.

589
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,820
I'm sorry about your daughter, Joel.

590
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,820
But I have lost people too.

591
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,820
You have no idea what loss is.

592
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,820
Everybody I have cared for has either died or left me.

593
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,820
Everybody fucking except for you!

594
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,820
So don't tell me that I'd be safe with somebody else,

595
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,820
because the truth is, I would just be more scared.

596
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
You're right.

597
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
You're right.

598
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,820
You're not my daughter.

599
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,820
And I sure as hell ain't your dad.

600
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,820
Now come down.

601
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,820
We're going our separate ways.

602
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,820
Melodrama.

603
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,820
Well...

604
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,820
And the most fucking formulaic one as well.

605
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,820
I don't like you. I don't like you either.

606
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,820
Save it later.

607
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,820
So here's the thing.

608
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,820
They changed something drastic in that scene.

609
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,820
That was line for line.

610
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,820
The same scene in the show, which I can appreciate.

611
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:38,820
But in the game, that was the first moment of weakness that Joel ever showed.

612
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,820
Was in that conversation with Ellie.

613
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,820
And it was supposed to be an important moment.

614
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,820
But he's already shown weakness.

615
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
He's shown a lot of it.

616
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,820
Yes, this whole episode has been him showing weakness,

617
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,820
and it kind of dulled the impact of that scene quite a bit.

618
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,820
I play as Devil's advocate.

619
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:09,820
I think them showing him weakness prior to that was so that line wouldn't come across as jarring to the viewer.

620
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,820
We're out of nowhere.

621
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
You think?

622
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,820
I'm guessing that's the reason why they did that.

623
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:25,820
I remember in the game, it comes across as Joel's first moment of,

624
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,820
Oh, he actually does care about this girl.

625
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,820
And it's not just all about Tess.

626
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,820
And then he immediately squashes that down.

627
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,820
And you can see what's going on with Joel when he does it.

628
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,820
But in this, that whole scene with Tommy I think ruined that sentiment.

629
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,820
Maybe.

630
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,820
I do appreciate that they did it line for line and shot for shot again,

631
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,820
but I guess you can't get everything right, eh?

632
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,820
I came here to steal one of these horses and go.

633
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,820
Well, it gave you one.

634
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,820
I know.

635
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:09,820
Anyway, that was 30 minutes ago, and I guess you deserve a choice.

636
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,820
I still think you'd be better off with Tommy.

637
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
Let's go.

638
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,820
Okay, well, at least they skipped the pointless drama in the middle

639
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,820
before they decided to get back together again, I guess.

640
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,820
Can I borrow that?

641
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,820
Yeah, because Maria took mine, you know.

642
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,820
I already said yes, Joel.

643
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,820
Couldn't you just give him his gun back?

644
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,820
You have some ammo?

645
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,820
Well, I guess five rounds is it.

646
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,820
That's it.

647
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,820
Four.

648
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,820
Three.

649
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,820
Two.

650
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,820
You're flinching.

651
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,820
The target's too small.

652
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,820
I made it bigger than I should have.

653
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,820
Eject the cartridge.

654
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,820
I would assume they have more ammo than that.

655
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,820
I'm not flinching.

656
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,820
The rifle just sucks.

657
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,820
Okay, give it.

658
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,820
So, I know that they filmed a chunk of the show on the Canadian prairies in the spring.

659
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,820
So, I think this is actually happening during Canadian spring.

660
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,820
You gonna shoot this thing or get it pregnant?

661
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,820
It isn't gonna work.

662
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,820
It doesn't aim right.

663
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,820
You dick.

664
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,820
Now, he would have missed too because he shook the fuck out of that thing

665
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,820
like he's scared of the recoil.

666
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,820
There's enough snow like in the far background of these shots

667
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,820
that I think this is actually...

668
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,820
This is like March or April in Canada.

669
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,820
Okay.

670
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,820
That's right.

671
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,820
Houses, stores, that kind of thing.

672
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,820
You had the communists and the anarcho-capitalists.

673
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,820
And that's all you had in America, apparently.

674
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,820
According to him, yeah.

675
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,820
He just wanted to grill.

676
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
We were cool.

677
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,820
Everybody loved contractors.

678
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:22,820
Nice.

679
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,820
Dude, people fucking hate contractors.

680
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,820
Fuck.

681
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,820
Well, I mean, get a good one.

682
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,820
You hire a contractor 50-50 shot whether or not the job's gonna be done right.

683
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,820
Or on time.

684
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,820
Good contractor is much like good consultant.

685
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,820
Pretty good.

686
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,820
Or working communism.

687
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,820
Fuck.

688
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,820
Yeah, this shot has to be like Alberta or something.

689
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,820
Basically.

690
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,820
But violent.

691
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,820
God, it's so flat it makes my cell hurt.

692
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,820
True.

693
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,820
But if you're driving down the Trans-Canada,

694
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,820
you can go like 200 miles an hour and not hit anything.

695
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,820
What, you mean to tell me the entire Canada is trans?

696
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:16,820
Oh, God.

697
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,820
God damn it.

698
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,820
Reminds me of Denmark.

699
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,820
The worst place on Earth.

700
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,820
Denmark?

701
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,820
It too is ungodly flat.

702
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,820
Oh, wow.

703
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,820
So I have to assume that like

704
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,820
they modeled the university in the game after a real university

705
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,820
because that's the university.

706
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,820
It could be CGI.

707
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,820
Yeah, that's true.

708
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,820
Looks a bit CGI.

709
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,820
Because I know that the university they used was, I think,

710
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,820
was some historical university in...

711
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,820
Looks exactly like the game, too.

712
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,820
That's pretty incredible.

713
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,820
To be fair, that's what I did my first time at university.

714
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,820
I wasted like $50,000 on the university.

715
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,820
$50,000 in fucking bullshit.

716
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,820
The only thing I got out of it was a bunch of wasted money,

717
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,820
a World of Warcraft habit,

718
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,820
and I became a fucking communist for a few years.

719
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,820
An actual communist this time, Arch.

720
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,820
Not the fake one you always call me.

721
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,820
And then you never stopped.

722
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,820
Fair enough.

723
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,820
Are those monkeys?

724
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,820
Must be from the old labs.

725
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,820
First time seeing a monkey.

726
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
Return the monkey.

727
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,820
Ah, yes. Canada.

728
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,820
It's a remarkably friendly place for monkeys.

729
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,820
Yeah, time to the tree, man.

730
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,820
Or at least the bike rack.

731
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,820
I do recall reading about one kid who went to university on a horse every day

732
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,820
and he actually did tie his horse to the bike rack.

733
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,820
So this campus actually isn't the post-apocalypse.

734
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,820
It's just after Milo Yiannopoulos gave a speech.

735
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,820
Makes me feel old just to hear that reference.

736
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,820
Listen, if there's infected up there,

737
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,820
the best thing to do is to shout and stand in the light.

738
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,820
So at least you have an advantage if they come down.

739
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,820
Yeah, but there's not enough time left in the episode to get into any action,

740
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,820
so they're gonna have to just find some random dude who stayed behind.

741
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,820
So they can kill him in the next episode.

742
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,820
Oh wow, you're right. This episode, like, flew by.

743
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,820
Yep, it's almost over.

744
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,820
Ah, sort of a person.

745
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,820
That was the fake-out.

746
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,820
Well, at least it ain't clickers.

747
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,820
Oh no, it's a band of Negan's.

748
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,820
Yeah, put that away.

749
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,820
Probably not gonna be here.

750
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,820
Listen, he's old and weak, that's why he just snapped that grown man's neck

751
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,820
like it was a piece of fucking crinkle bar.

752
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,820
Look, he does that, like, 50 times in a game, okay?

753
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,820
Oh no.

754
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,820
Okay, when did that happen?

755
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,820
Don't pull it out.

756
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,820
You idiot!

757
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,820
I thought that was foolish.

758
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,820
Like, you can still ride back to the town.

759
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:17,820
You know, Ellie, this would be a perfect opportunity to just shoot him.

760
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,820
Or just, you know, do that.

761
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,820
And now he's leaking.

762
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,820
Remember, children,

763
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,820
if something is keeping your blood inside of you, don't remove it.

764
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,820
What the fuck is up with that horse's leg?

765
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,820
What the fuck is up with that horse's leg?

766
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,820
It's kinda bent, eh?

767
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,820
No, the other leg. The other leg is dead straight.

768
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,820
Yeah.

769
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,820
Well, it's almost like that's his tail.

770
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,820
Which is giving it a little bit of optical illusion.

771
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,820
Yeah, I'm starting to wonder, like, what?

772
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,820
Yep, I saw that too, and I was like, is this a bugged-out video game or something?

773
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,820
So, there we go.

774
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,820
Well, there you go.

775
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,820
Joel's gonna die.

776
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,820
I mean, he won't be saved by some random passerby.

777
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:23,820
Doesn't matter, he's gonna get golf-clubbed anyways. Nothing matters.

778
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,820
Nihilist, Kibbs.

779
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,820
It's all over.

780
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,820
It's all over.

781
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:34,820
So, everything about this episode was game-accurate.

782
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,820
Except, one, they made the town look more like its Last of Us 2 incarnation than Last of Us 1.

783
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,820
Two, they added the woman who's presumably going to become Ellie's girlfriend later, looked just like her.

784
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:56,820
And three, that extra scene with Joel and Tommy having that heart-to-heart where he talks about having panic attacks.

785
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:02,820
And I think that was probably the scene that, you know, ruined the episode for me, I would say.

786
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,820
Because it ruined the impact of the Joel and Ellie conversation.

787
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,820
I think that's an accurate assessment.

788
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:13,820
It changes the chemistry between Joel and Ellie a lot this episode.

789
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,820
And it changes the focus too, which I think is, I think long-term, I think that's detriment.

790
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,820
I know, Lilith, you were devil's advocating the other side. Is that how you actually feel?

791
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:30,820
I don't know if it necessarily destroys the dynamic, personally.

792
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:43,820
I think for the viewers, it probably builds it up a bit so it doesn't come across as jarring, that Joel feels like has those PTSD moments, I guess.

793
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,820
The thing is, I think jarring was the point of that.

794
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:54,820
The character who has been a cliff, a rock up until this point, suddenly shows a point of humanity and weakness.

795
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:00,820
If he's suddenly bawling over and having bitch fates in the middle of nowhere, that kind of undermines the character.

796
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:07,820
It's not out of nowhere. In the context of the story, it's just a few moments before the scene was-

797
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,820
A few moments of being a bitch before he actually has emotions.

798
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:17,820
Again, that's the thing. His character is supposed to be that of the rock, the tough guy.

799
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,820
And having that break down for even a moment is a big deal.

800
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,820
But if it breaks down like five times in the same episode, it's no longer a big deal.

801
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:37,820
Well, it's also that at this point in the game, the facade of this just being a job has been consistently maintained the whole time.

802
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:43,820
And this is the moment where it breaks just for a second. Here, Arch, you haven't seen the scene, I'm gonna share it with you.

803
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,820
It's a two minute scene, it's not a big deal. Just so you know what's going on, okay?

804
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,820
Did you say no?

805
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:18,820
Do you even realize what your life means? Huh? Running off like that, putting yourself at risk? It's pretty goddamn stupid.

806
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,820
Well, I guess we're both disappointed with each other then.

807
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,820
What do you want from me?

808
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,820
Admit that you wanted to get rid of me the whole time.

809
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,820
Tommy knows this area better than-

810
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,820
Oh fuck!

811
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,820
Well, I'm sorry. I trust him better than I trust myself.

812
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:43,820
Stop with the bullshit! What are you so afraid of? That I'm gonna end up like Sam? I can't get infected! I can take care of myself!

813
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,820
How many close calls have we had?

814
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,820
Well, we seem to be doing alright so far.

815
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,820
And now you'll be doing even better with Tommy!

816
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,820
I'm not her, you know.

817
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,820
What?

818
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,820
Maria told me about Sarah and-

819
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,820
Ellie!

820
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,820
And-

821
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,820
You are treading on some mighty thin ice here.

822
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,820
I'm sorry about your daughter, Joel. But I have lost people too.

823
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,820
You have no idea what loss is.

824
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,820
Everyone I have cared for has either died or left me.

825
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,820
Everyone except for you!

826
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:30,820
So don't tell me that I would be safer with someone else because the truth is I would just be more scared.

827
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,820
You're right.

828
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,820
You're not my daughter.

829
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,820
And I sure as hell ain't your dad.

830
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,820
And we are going our separate ways.

831
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,820
Get it together! We're not alone.

832
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,820
Oh yeah, also a fight scene happens right after because it's a video game, right?

833
00:43:55,820 --> 00:44:06,820
But the point of the scene is rather than relying on Joel's insecurity about his own abilities and his aging and his panic attacks and all of this,

834
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:16,820
he maintains the facade that it is just about the job and about who is going to do the job better right up until Ellie mentions his daughter.

835
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,820
And that's the one moment where we realize that it's actually not about that at all.

836
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:29,820
And I think that this moment is undermined when you have that big talk between the two brothers in the previous scene.

837
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:36,820
I can see your perspective. The impact seems to be a little bit softened because of that scene.

838
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:43,820
And considering that this is I think probably the fan's favorite scene of the entire game is this moment,

839
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:49,820
I think it's kind of a big deal, at least if you're like a die-hard Last of Us fan, to see it ruined a bit.

840
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:56,820
Just because they wanted to, I don't know, do a very special episode about mental health with Joel. I don't fucking know.

841
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,820
I feel like you're getting old. Joel feels like he's getting old.

842
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:10,820
It's very obvious in the television show they are currently doing their best to make sure that Joel is not, well, tough.

843
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,820
They are undermining his tough guy character because up until this point he's been a tough guy.

844
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,820
And he's been competent and he's done well for himself and he's kept Ellie safe.

845
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:24,820
Now he has panic attacks. He needs to lean over and touch grass occasionally.

846
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,820
He's worried about his age and he can't do anything and then he gets stabbed in the gut by a baseball bat somehow.

847
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,820
I already watched that fight scene. He did not have an opportunity to stab them there.

848
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,820
Now it's just posted.

849
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,820
I knew it. I knew that's what I think. I was like, I just don't see it.

850
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,820
Yeah, no, he did not have an opportunity to get a stab in on him there.

851
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,820
That was one of those shock value, like he got stabbed scenes.

852
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:56,820
The fight was way too goddamn short. There was only one moment in which he could potentially have done it, but his grip was all wrong.

853
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,820
He was holding onto the jagged end. There's no way he stabbed it in that deep.

854
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,820
How did it happen in the game?

855
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:13,820
Oh, you know what it is? No, he didn't get stabbed. He fell off of a railing in the university and got impaled on something.

856
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:22,820
There's an extended scene where you're fighting with blurry vision and you're stuck to the ground while Ellie has to pry you up and you're shooting guys that are running at you.

857
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:27,820
Yeah, that's right. That's what this was. And that's why he had to pull it out because he was stuck to the ground. He just had to get up.

858
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:32,820
But, I mean, all the other moments were pretty much identical. All the other beats were pretty much the same.

859
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:42,820
Things seemed okay in the show. And you know what? They still tugged at all the right heart strings. I'm sure Twitter is blowing up about it.

860
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:47,820
They probably love it over there. But if you're a purist, I don't think you'll like this episode.

861
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:53,820
That's my final take on it. If any of you guys want to add a little bit more.

862
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,820
That's true, sir.

863
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,820
I'm kind of on the same page as you, honestly, when it comes to the episode.

864
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,820
Alright. Take care, everybody.

865
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,820
Little's like, I gotta go eat some fucking meatloaf. I'm done.

866
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,820
Food time.
