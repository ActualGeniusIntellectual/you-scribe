0	6680	So, it turns out that Lilith is late because she's making a meatloaf.
6680	7680	Yes.
7680	10680	I mean, I don't really blame Lilith.
10680	13840	I mean, that's infinitely more interesting than a TV show, so.
13840	14840	Meatloaf sounds tasty.
14840	15840	Thank you.
15840	16840	I'm glad you understand.
16840	17840	Meatloaf is great.
17840	18840	It takes priority.
18840	24720	I thought it would be done earlier, but I guess the slab of meat I was working with
24720	28560	today was bigger than the one I was working with last time, so.
28560	29560	I gotta be honest.
30120	31120	I've actually cooked a meatloaf before.
31120	32120	Oh, it's super easy.
32120	33120	Oh, yeah?
33120	40920	You just cut it up, season it a bunch, put it on a metal plate, and put it in nothing.
40920	42680	Do you stuff it with veggies?
42680	43680	Do you put like- No.
43680	44680	No?
44680	50200	When I make homemade burgers, what I'll do is I'll stuff the meat with garlic, with onions,
50200	51200	and with chopped kale.
51200	52200	Oh, you can do that.
52200	53200	You can do that, definitely.
53200	56800	Lots of people like to rub garlic into it.
56800	61160	If I had garlic, I would have done that, but I didn't, so I just used garlic salt today.
61160	62160	Right, right.
62160	69160	What you should be doing is you should be baking in egg and cheese.
69160	70160	Oh.
70160	73160	I've heard a lot about putting eggs in instead of breadcrumbs to find their meat together.
73160	75160	I did add a little bit of cheese on mine.
75160	76160	Yeah.
76160	78520	Yeah, the egg is an interesting solution to bread, or alternative.
78520	80520	So what do you do with the egg?
80520	84720	Basically, when you have the- you take the meatloaf first, and instead of making it into
84720	90280	the loaf, you have all the ground meat out in a long platter kind of thing.
90280	91280	Uh-huh.
91280	95120	Then you take the egg, you beat it up a little bit so it's nice and yellow and consistent
95120	98880	up, kind of like you're making omelet, and then you just pour that on the center, and
98880	103920	then you roll the meatloaf over it, and then you pack it in on both sides, so it's kind
103920	107360	of in the center of the meatloaf, and then you roast as usual.
107360	108360	Nice.
108360	109360	Okay.
109360	114200	Now this, you do need to cut into it to make sure that it's cooked on the inside, because
114200	118080	if it isn't cooked through, you're going to have raw egg inside of your meat, and that's
118080	119080	a problem.
119080	120080	Yeah.
120080	121080	Yeah, but like Sunnyside D.
121080	128080	But it is actually quite delicious, and it's- if you cool it down, it's eatable, it's almost
128080	129080	just like spread.
129080	132280	You slice off a thin piece, put it on bread, and eat.
132280	135160	So we're back together again to watch The Last of Us.
135160	140680	You know, when we were watching The Rings of Power, even though it was really, really
140680	144960	bad, it was kind of like a momentous occasion, you know, because Lord of the Rings is a much
144960	150100	bigger property than The Last of Us, and Rings of Power was a much bigger shitshow than this
150100	151720	show was turning out to be.
151720	154900	I don't know how I feel about watching a good show on my channel, or at least like a passing
154900	156280	show on my channel, you know?
156280	160600	Yeah, better stop then, because we're just development.
160600	161600	That's what we'll do.
161600	162600	I have to hate watch.
162600	169880	It could be better, because that's the thing, this is a passing show, but it's no Spartacus,
169880	171280	it's no Rome.
171280	175040	It's no the first few seasons of Game of Thrones, you know?
175040	177120	Game of Thrones, sub-tier to Rome.
177120	183920	And man, you know what, speaking of just passable shows, I watched season 3 episode 1 of Picard,
183920	188760	and I was surprised that it was mediocre, because Picard has been the worst show I've
188760	194240	ever seen in my fucking life for two seasons, and it's bumped up massively to just being
194240	195600	normal bad.
195600	200320	I tried to get into the Trek of the Stars, and I did so by trying to watch Picard.
200320	203600	So I'm like, yeah, I'll get in on the ground floor of this, let's see what everybody's
203600	204600	talking about.
204600	207640	I watched the first episode, and I was like, well, time's wrong again.
207640	208640	This is shit.
208640	210760	You start, hold on, your first episode of Star Trek-
210760	213260	That's probably not the best place to start.
213260	218840	Your first episode of Star Trek was the worst show of all time?
218840	223780	Actually, to be fair, my first proper Star Trek that I watched was STD, which I kind
223780	226140	of enjoyed, because it was just a stupid action show.
226140	227460	Oh, god damn it.
227460	230180	Go back and watch the good stuff, go back and watch TNG and DS9.
230180	231660	He doesn't like it.
231660	236180	He did try to give DS9 a swing, which I'll give him credit for that, but sadly it didn't
236180	238160	stick with him, which breaks my heart.
238160	243460	So when I started dating Naomi, Naomi's a Zoomer, she's younger than me, so I'm a millennial,
243460	245820	and she hadn't ever seen anything about Star Trek before.
245820	246820	Age gap.
246820	247820	That makes you a pedophile.
247820	250820	I'm gonna get cancelled for the age gap, yeah.
250820	254700	I'm gonna get cancelled by all the TikTok Zoomers.
254700	258780	So I sat down with her and I'm like, listen, Naomi, we're watching every single piece of
258780	262420	Star Trek in order of release, and we went through the whole thing.
262420	267700	We went through, we did the original series from 1967 or whatever, we did the animated
267700	272540	series, we did the movies, we did TNG, DS9, Voyager, we did all of it.
272540	279500	And she became a Star Trek hyper fan just in time to be let down by all the new Trek.
279500	284260	It's tragic, but that's actually kind of where I'm at with that, too, because I didn't
284260	285260	find-
285260	286260	Well, what's her favorite character?
286260	287260	Her favorite character?
287260	288260	Yeah.
288260	289260	Oh, Jesus.
289260	290260	That's gonna be a hard one, too.
290260	292260	Actually, I don't know what her favorite character would be.
292260	296260	Naomi, what is your favorite Star Trek character of all time?
296260	297260	Of all time?
297260	298260	Yeah.
298260	299260	I can't pick just one.
299260	300260	Come on, pick one.
300260	301260	Yeah, see?
301260	302260	That's a hard question.
302260	307100	Yeah, I knew it would be.
307100	308300	One of the entire franchise.
308300	309300	Oof.
309300	310300	I don't know.
310300	311300	Odo's pretty close.
311300	312300	I mean-
312300	313300	Odo?
313300	314300	Yeah.
314300	315300	I like Odo.
315300	316300	I could pick.
316300	317300	I can't pick one.
317300	318300	Can you pick one for each show?
318300	319300	Like, original series?
319300	320300	Original series is Spock.
320300	321300	Yes, of course.
321300	322300	And then TNG is...
322300	323300	Was obviously Picard.
323300	324300	But he was ruined by Picard.
324300	325300	Yeah.
325300	326300	Well, you know what?
326300	327300	We're not talking about Picard.
327300	334300	We're talking about the character of Picard in TNG where he was good.
334300	335300	Okay?
335300	338620	Well, to be fair, Picard also ruined Data.
338620	340620	So you can't even fall back on that.
340620	341620	Yeah, exactly.
341620	342620	Yeah.
342620	343620	So...
343620	344620	Odo and DS9, obviously.
344620	345620	DS9 was...
345620	346620	Yeah.
346620	347620	Odo for DS9.
347620	348620	Voyager?
348620	349620	Then Voyager...
349620	350620	Probably Seven of Nine, realistically.
350620	351620	Is that just because she's not-
351620	352620	No.
352620	353620	I like her character arc.
353620	354620	Oh, yeah.
354620	361260	She has lots of arcs going all over her body, I know.
361260	365620	I can tell based on your face that's what you were thinking of, too.
365620	366620	No, it wasn't.
366620	367620	All right.
367620	368620	You know me.
368620	369620	You're abandoned.
369620	370620	Dev.
370620	371620	Yes?
371620	372620	It's EMH.
372620	376420	The EMH Doctor is the best character in Voyager.
376420	377420	Not Seven of Nine.
377420	379820	You have to break up with him.
379820	381620	The EMH is actually an interesting character.
381620	382620	Yeah, the Doctor.
382620	386460	He's a great actor, and he's an opera singer, too, if I remember right.
386460	387980	There's one final thing I must confirm.
387980	388980	Okay.
388980	389980	What's up?
389980	390980	Naomi.
390980	391980	Dev.
391980	392980	Okay.
392980	394980	Your Enterprise character was T'Pol, right?
394980	395980	Oh, fuck.
395980	396980	The Enterprise.
397340	398340	Yeah, it's because of the curves.
398340	399340	I know.
399340	400340	Thank you.
400340	401340	All right.
401340	402480	Enterprise doesn't count.
402480	404180	It's been a long time.
404180	405180	I hate that intro.
405180	408820	I think we've sexually shamed Naomi enough for liking hot TV women.
408820	412340	Should we watch the zombie show now?
412340	413820	I mean, I guess we can.
413820	414820	I think it's time.
414820	415820	I think it's time.
415820	416820	We can commence.
416820	420700	Oh, I put mushrooms sometimes in my burgers, too.
420700	423100	Just chop them up like little tiny mushroom chops.
423100	425100	Little pieces and put them in the burgers.
425100	426100	Yeah.
426220	429220	Give me a gun.
429220	430220	Oh, shit.
430220	432220	I gotta turn on subtitles.
432220	434220	Give me a gun.
434220	435220	Whoops.
435220	436220	Henry, no!
436220	437220	By a black person.
437220	439220	Leading cause of death in America.
439220	440220	Wow.
440220	441220	Black person.
441220	443620	His arch celebrates.
443620	445020	That is very arch.
445020	446020	Ah.
446020	447020	Home.
447020	450140	Actually, it's a bit too flat to be home.
450140	456020	You always realized they're not doing the four seasons thing that Last of Us did.
456020	458740	Do you remember that, Lilith and Kibs?
458740	459740	Oh, yeah.
459740	460740	They went through the seasons.
460740	461740	Yeah.
461740	463740	They divided the game into quarters based on the season.
463740	464740	Motherfucker.
464740	465740	That's impressive.
465740	474220	Oh, this is going to be nine episodes, right?
474220	475220	Miniseries?
475220	476220	Nine or ten?
476220	477220	Oh, God.
477220	478220	Wow.
478220	484220	You've, uh, you've lived through the apocalypse well, honey.
484220	487340	Not bad.
487340	489020	You must be a very good hunter.
489020	491020	Who the hell are you?
491020	494620	There's someone passing through.
494620	495620	Take the gun out.
495620	496620	Two fingers only.
496620	497620	Put it out of reach.
497620	498620	Why did you shoot him?
498620	501620	The gun's all the way over there.
501620	505020	He didn't hurt me, by the way.
505020	508020	He's got a girl with him.
508020	511020	Can I con-jow?
511020	512020	No.
512020	513020	Henry.
513820	515820	What did I just say?
515820	516820	Joel, come on.
516820	517820	There's like a thousand.
517820	518820	Who's this little psycho?
518820	519820	Never mind her.
519820	521820	I need you to tell us where we are.
521820	522820	You got a map?
522820	523820	Why you lost?
523820	525820	You must have missed all the street signs in the enormous fucking forest.
525820	526820	Holy.
526820	531820	I like how they're just laughing at her.
531820	532820	Exactly where?
532820	534820	And your answer better be the same as your wife's.
534820	537820	Did you tell them the truth?
537820	538820	Yeah.
538820	541820	Are you telling me the truth?
541820	542820	Yeah.
543620	545620	What about the fireflies?
545620	547620	We get those in the summer.
547620	548620	Not the bugs.
548620	549620	The people.
549620	552620	There are firefly people?
552620	554620	Oh my god.
554620	556620	You got any advice on the best way to...
556620	559620	What are the best characters so far?
559620	560620	Gooey.
560620	565520	So having had a bunch of experience with like native people living on reservations in Canada,
565520	568220	they are exactly like this.
568220	569220	Don't give a fuck.
569220	571220	Just relax and chillin' out.
571220	572220	Put that back.
572620	573620	I don't know anything.
573620	575620	You're stealing a rabbit.
580620	581620	Joel?
581620	582620	Joel?
582620	583620	Joel, are you okay?
583620	584620	Joel?
584620	585620	Shut up.
585620	586620	Holy shit.
586620	587620	Are you dying?
587620	588620	I'm okay.
588620	589620	I'm okay.
589620	590620	I'm okay.
590620	591620	I'm fine.
591620	592620	No, no.
592620	593620	But are you?
593620	594620	Because just to remind you that you're dead.
594620	595620	I'm fucked.
595620	596620	I'm fine.
596620	597620	Okay.
597620	599620	It's just the cold air.
600020	601020	Oh, I saw you.
604020	606020	I think this is new.
610020	613020	I don't recall Joel having an old man sickness.
613020	617020	Yeah, I've been hearing something that they hinted at in the beginning episode.
617020	621020	That's new information, or made up information, whatever you want to call it.
621020	627820	If they're smart, they'll kill his ass via natural causes instead of the way he went
627820	630820	in that other game.
630820	633820	The unceremonious death by fucking golf club.
633820	634820	Uh huh.
634820	635820	Fuck.
635820	638820	And then they try to get you to sympathize with the character that killed him.
638820	639820	Yep.
639820	640820	Mm-hmm.
640820	641820	That didn't work out so well.
641820	642820	Don't be like that very much.
642820	643820	Close the dark.
643820	644820	No, nobody did.
644820	645820	There's some caves along the river.
645820	647820	We'll set up camp there, cross in the morning.
647820	649820	Yeah, it's a better way for him to go.
649820	650820	Just keep moving.
650820	651820	One could be so lucky.
651820	654820	That rabbit is so fucking fake, by the way.
654820	655820	Oh yeah.
655820	656820	Yep.
656820	659820	That's too big to be like a...
659820	660820	Well the eyes of a woman.
660820	662260	That size isn't necessarily wrong.
662260	664820	What gives it away is that thing is still flopping.
664820	668820	It's been dead for hours, it should be stiff as a board.
668820	670820	Can I have some?
670820	671820	No.
671820	676820	What, just to warm up?
676820	680220	Unscientific fact, alcohol does not actually make you warmer.
680220	683820	Nope, it just makes you numb.
684820	687820	Cough, cough, cough.
687820	688820	Yep.
688820	689820	So gross.
689820	691820	You know, I'm a grown man at this point.
691820	694820	I still don't like the taste of hard liquor.
694820	696820	I don't think anybody does.
696820	698820	It's fucking awful.
698820	701820	I would raise sheep.
701820	703820	They're quiet.
703820	705820	Do what they're told.
705820	707820	Actually, no.
707820	708820	Not in the slightest.
708820	710820	They're snarky as fuck.
710820	712820	They haven't been around sheeps, they're not quiet.
712820	714820	Nor do they do what they're told.
714820	716820	They're disobedient little shits.
716820	718820	What about you, where are you gonna go?
718820	720820	He's gonna be a sheep fucker.
720820	722820	Look at all that meat left on that poor rabbit.
722820	725820	Yeah, it's just grilling there.
725820	728820	They couldn't have been very hungry, I guess.
728820	729820	Yeah.
729820	731820	They've been doing pretty well with the journey, I guess.
731820	733820	No fetish in the morning.
733820	734820	What can I say, man?
734820	737820	I'm a natural.
737820	741820	What amazes me is that's a grown woman and that rifle still looks like it'll bowl her
741820	743820	over if she fired it.
743820	745820	Yeah.
745820	749820	She looks like a grown woman the same way that Greta Thunberg now looks like a grown woman.
749820	751820	Like, I know she's 18.
751820	755820	Yeah, well, she's 18, but she's tiny as fuck, you know?
755820	761820	And her parents specifically dress and groom her to look like a fucking 10-year-old.
761820	764820	When you say groom in the context of Greta Thunberg, it just sounds bad.
764820	767820	Well, I mean it in both contexts in this case.
767820	770820	Oh, no.
770820	772820	Fine.
775820	779820	Ah, yes, fire your gun and then wait for about five seconds.
779820	781820	Then walk out of cover.
781820	783820	That's pretty smart.
783820	786820	I'm sure anyone watching would have given up after the first three.
786820	788820	Actually, Arch, it's not just her parents.
788820	791820	Did you see that there were some...
791820	795820	I think they were rhinoids because they were coming at it from an anti-environmentalist perspective,
795820	800820	but they were talking about how now that Greta Thunberg is 18, she's certain OnlyFans.
800820	805820	I'm like, Jesus, guys. Calm the fuck down with that.
805820	807820	What?
807820	811820	I'm assuming how she's been raised for quite enough time, I think.
811820	817820	I just imagine a chick that has been repressed that hard by her parents and controlled that hard for this long.
817820	820820	Oh, there's going to be some behaviour there.
820820	823820	Oh, like going off to a party at university or something?
823820	825820	You don't know how to whistle?
825820	827820	Does it sound like I know how to whistle?
827820	829820	No.
829820	832820	Seriously, though, how the fuck do you do that?
832820	833820	Tyler.
833820	834820	Whatever.
834820	836820	You should teach me how to hunt.
836820	837820	Oh.
837820	840820	That's such a wise answer.
840820	844820	Tyler is genuinely actually pretty good at their interactions.
844820	847820	Yeah, they're getting there for sure.
847820	849820	Damn.
849820	850820	Correct.
850820	852820	You know Will Livingston.
852820	855820	Yeah, but who is?
855820	857820	So that made electricity?
857820	861820	Yeah. Don't ask me. I don't have a clue.
861820	867820	I mean, theoretically, it still should. A hydroelectric dam doesn't require a lot of maintenance, but...
867820	870820	Oh, no.
876820	880820	Oh, look, another group of outlaws with a female leader.
881820	883820	How about you shut the fuck up?
883820	884820	OK. Easy.
884820	887820	They do say women are the future.
887820	889820	They're apparently correct.
889820	891820	Last chance for a bullet.
891820	895820	But you've earned the fact that he will smell it and he will rip you up.
897820	899820	Oh, shit.
906820	908820	Now her.
908820	910820	Oh.
928820	929820	That's lucky.
929820	930820	What's her name?
930820	932820	There's the leader. Like barge called...
932820	933820	Oh, dang.
933820	934820	Oh, obviously.
935820	940820	I guess the smart thing is to build your new town somewhere else, since all the old ones are too infected.
940820	943820	Oh, yeah. Away from civilization.
943820	947820	Rather than doing QZs, like Fedra did.
948820	954820	Yeah, then you scatter fake powder snow on it, which is just white sand.
954820	956820	And voila! Home.
956820	965820	I hate how all of these shows are... shows snow. I hate video game snow.
965820	967820	Nobody gets snow right.
967820	969820	Yeah.
971820	975820	You know, my front yard currently has like ten feet of snow in it.
975820	978820	You gotta learn how to do snow, guys.
986820	988820	I came here to save you.
994820	997820	Are these the good guys?
1001820	1004820	Oh, they've got electricity. That's nice.
1006820	1009820	Oh, they took the look of this place from the second game.
1009820	1010820	There's more if you need it.
1010820	1011820	Unfortunately.
1011820	1012820	Thank you, ma'am.
1012820	1016820	Yes, this is the second game settlement where they settle down.
1037820	1038820	Oh.
1039820	1041820	Kevs, did you recognize?
1041820	1043820	Was that the Jewish lady?
1047820	1050820	That looks like her girlfriend in the second game.
1051820	1052820	Ah, cringe.
1053820	1054820	I hate this show now.
1055820	1058820	They're bringing in like second season stuff or something.
1060820	1062820	I hope they never get a second season.
1071820	1074820	Maria is family, actually.
1075820	1078820	Oh, shit. Congrats.
1080820	1082820	Joel, say congrats.
1086820	1087820	Congrats.
1089820	1091820	House of Worship. Multifaith.
1091820	1093820	School. Laundry.
1093820	1096820	O Bank works as the J on that we've muted.
1096820	1097820	You draw power from a dam.
1097820	1099820	Got that working a couple of years ago.
1100820	1101820	Nice.
1107820	1109820	And they're sheeps.
1115820	1116820	Oh, boys.
1120820	1121820	Of course.
1122820	1123820	The commune.
1124820	1126820	They're democratically elected.
1127820	1128820	Hunting.
1128820	1130820	It's The Last of Us Part Two.
1130820	1132820	Greenhouses, livestock.
1132820	1133820	All shared.
1133820	1134820	Nope.
1134820	1135820	Communes.
1135820	1136820	It is a commune.
1136820	1137820	Communism.
1137820	1138820	Yes.
1138820	1139820	Oh.
1139820	1140820	It ain't like that.
1140820	1141820	It is that.
1141820	1142820	Literally.
1142820	1143820	This is a commune.
1143820	1144820	We're communists.
1144820	1145820	Oh, OK.
1145820	1146820	No way.
1146820	1148820	That's our newest one.
1148820	1149820	Couple months old.
1149820	1150820	You want a pet?
1150820	1151820	Oh, there you go.
1151820	1155820	All you need for communism to succeed is the death of 99% of the population.
1155820	1161820	99% of humanity and collapse of civilization.
1161820	1164820	A small, vacated, armed commune.
1164820	1168820	Not to mention, you know, a rider to shoehorn everything to work.
1169820	1173820	This actually makes sense because this is how the Zapatistas run things in Mexico.
1173820	1181820	They live in one of the poorest, most dysfunctional, most undeveloped places in the entire world, even including Africa.
1181820	1189820	And the only way they, like, basically the social organization that communism brought them actually advanced them.
1189820	1192820	But only because they had literally nothing.
1192820	1196820	And some organization, even bad organization, is better than nothing.
1196820	1197820	You on the other hand.
1197820	1198820	Yep.
1199820	1204820	Literally, when the world is a zombie apocalypse, communism might be a valley sculpture.
1206820	1207820	So how's Tess?
1208820	1209820	Dead.
1209820	1210820	She's fine.
1210820	1211820	So you know where they might be?
1211820	1212820	These fireflies?
1213820	1216820	They got a base down at the University of Eastern Colorado.
1217820	1219820	It's a week's ride south.
1220820	1225820	I continue to be impressed by the fact that they still have alcohol after the last, like, 20-odd years.
1225820	1227820	I'm not sure how much they'd be drinking it.
1228820	1229820	Maybe they're making some now.
1231820	1232820	I could make moonshine.
1232820	1234820	Yeah, you could just make some.
1235820	1236820	That doesn't look like much.
1236820	1237820	I'm not sure.
1252820	1254820	Is Joel gonna be bitter about it?
1260820	1262820	Yep. That's what it is.
1262820	1267820	Is that a cool Christmas thing going on?
1268820	1269820	How nice.
1271820	1273820	You really shouldn't be doing that.
1276820	1279820	Resist the urge to lick the pole, Joel.
1280820	1283820	Joel, get stuck there, and this'll turn into the comedy.
1283820	1284820	Yep.
1285820	1294820	Remember, kids, do not touch metal in winter with exposed palms or tongues. Bad idea.
1296820	1298820	Uh, he's seeing her.
1299820	1301820	It's hair product, by the way. She probably was able to maintain that.
1302820	1303820	Yeah.
1304820	1305820	They're also manufacturing that, too.
1306820	1313820	If ancient Egyptians can make hair product, then why can't you make it in a post office?
1314820	1315820	Hmm.
1317820	1323820	Because modern day people don't know how to grow fucking carrots, much less make horse products.
1323820	1324820	Yeah, there we go. Horse products.
1325820	1327820	Wait, I'm across the street.
1328820	1330820	Oh, are they gonna start the romance early?
1331820	1333820	Uh, cringe.
1333820	1334820	Oh.
1338820	1339820	Gross.
1340820	1345820	20 year old period cup. Jesus. There's no way it still works. It'd be crinkling.
1346820	1348820	Also, sadly, it's not one of those anti-rape ones.
1349820	1350820	Oh, with the hooks?
1351820	1352820	Teeth inside.
1357820	1358820	Hello?
1359820	1361820	Wait, is everyone's door just open in the commune?
1361820	1363820	Of course. It's real communism, Kev.
1364820	1366820	Kibs? Dev? I don't even know who you are anymore.
1367820	1369820	Don't fucking mistake me for Dev, you son of a bitch.
1370820	1371820	Wait, look at the house.
1372820	1373820	It's pristine.
1374820	1375820	No, I think it's the same house as...
1376820	1377820	Yeah, this is... most of this is Last of Us Part 2 stuff.
1378820	1380820	Well, no, no, no. It's the same house as Bill's house. They just changed the furniture.
1382820	1383820	No. No.
1384820	1385820	I think so.
1386820	1387820	Dev, you're fucking high, Dev.
1388820	1390820	This is where the, um, the dining room was.
1391820	1392820	No, it wasn't.
1392820	1393820	It wouldn't do that.
1394820	1395820	Dev, you're high.
1396820	1397820	Dev, sit.
1398820	1399820	I think it is.
1400820	1408820	Like, they have all this budget for all these locations, and you think they would have to reuse the house.
1409820	1412820	I was an assistant district attorney out of Omaha, Nebraska.
1414820	1415820	I put bad guys in jail.
1416820	1417820	Oh, cool, I guess.
1418820	1419820	Oh, how about Harris?
1420820	1421820	Hahaha.
1443820	1444820	Hahaha.
1444820	1446820	So that conversation is...
1447820	1450820	It was different, but it was close enough to what they did in the game.
1458820	1462820	This is the most fucking abundant post-apocalypse I think I've ever seen.
1463820	1464820	Haha, yep.
1465820	1467820	No, it's communism. You know, it's golden.
1469820	1470820	Yeah, okay.
1471820	1475820	I think within the lore, it's explained in some places that have more warning than others.
1494820	1495820	She's in...
1499820	1500820	Tongues, actually.
1501820	1502820	Haha, yeah.
1524820	1527820	Because I was too slow and too fucking deaf to hear him coming.
1529820	1530820	I was so afraid.
1534820	1539820	You think I can still handle things, but I'm not who I was.
1540820	1541820	I'm weak.
1542820	1550820	Lately, there are these moments where the fear comes up out of nowhere, and my heart feels like it stopped.
1554820	1559820	Yeah, this is all new. He didn't have this in, like, panic attacks. He didn't have these in the original game.
1560820	1561820	You know, you just slaughtered people wholesale.
1562820	1565820	Sudden onset pussy-itis.
1566820	1567820	Haha, unfortunate, but yes.
1568820	1571820	A common affliction in this day and age among straight men.
1573820	1575820	I've lost something.
1576820	1578820	I'm failing in my sleep.
1580820	1581820	It's all I do.
1582820	1583820	It's all I've ever done.
1584820	1586820	I remember Joel being, like, a defeatist.
1589820	1590820	He had his moments, for sure.
1599820	1602820	Just a few minutes ago, the show told us that you can't trust anybody.
1603820	1605820	Because the only people you can betray are the people you trust.
1606820	1607820	I wonder what's gonna happen next.
1614820	1615820	No locks.
1616820	1617820	Nowhere. They've been outlawed.
1618820	1620820	Oh man, look at that old-school Mac!
1624820	1627820	In communism, you must trust your neighbor.
1645820	1647820	What exactly did you hear?
1649820	1651820	I have to leave her. You have to take her.
1656820	1658820	You know, I stood up for you today because I thought...
1663820	1665820	I made this decision for your own good.
1666820	1668820	You'll be way better off with Tommy.
1669820	1671820	He knows the area better than I do.
1672820	1673820	Do you give a shit about me or not?
1674820	1675820	Then what are you so afraid of?
1680820	1681820	I'm not her, you know.
1684820	1686820	Maria told me about Sarah and...
1686820	1687820	No.
1691820	1693820	Don't say another word.
1696820	1698820	I'm sorry about your daughter, Joel.
1700820	1701820	But I have lost people too.
1702820	1704820	You have no idea what loss is.
1706820	1710820	Everybody I have cared for has either died or left me.
1711820	1713820	Everybody fucking except for you!
1714820	1716820	So don't tell me that I'd be safe with somebody else,
1717820	1719820	because the truth is, I would just be more scared.
1727820	1728820	You're right.
1728820	1729820	You're right.
1730820	1731820	You're not my daughter.
1732820	1734820	And I sure as hell ain't your dad.
1737820	1738820	Now come down.
1739820	1741820	We're going our separate ways.
1752820	1753820	Melodrama.
1754820	1755820	Well...
1755820	1757820	And the most fucking formulaic one as well.
1757820	1759820	I don't like you. I don't like you either.
1760820	1761820	Save it later.
1761820	1762820	So here's the thing.
1763820	1765820	They changed something drastic in that scene.
1766820	1767820	That was line for line.
1768820	1770820	The same scene in the show, which I can appreciate.
1771820	1778820	But in the game, that was the first moment of weakness that Joel ever showed.
1779820	1781820	Was in that conversation with Ellie.
1782820	1784820	And it was supposed to be an important moment.
1785820	1787820	But he's already shown weakness.
1788820	1789820	He's shown a lot of it.
1790820	1792820	Yes, this whole episode has been him showing weakness,
1793820	1798820	and it kind of dulled the impact of that scene quite a bit.
1800820	1801820	I play as Devil's advocate.
1802820	1809820	I think them showing him weakness prior to that was so that line wouldn't come across as jarring to the viewer.
1810820	1811820	We're out of nowhere.
1812820	1813820	You think?
1814820	1816820	I'm guessing that's the reason why they did that.
1818820	1825820	I remember in the game, it comes across as Joel's first moment of,
1826820	1827820	Oh, he actually does care about this girl.
1828820	1829820	And it's not just all about Tess.
1830820	1832820	And then he immediately squashes that down.
1833820	1835820	And you can see what's going on with Joel when he does it.
1836820	1840820	But in this, that whole scene with Tommy I think ruined that sentiment.
1844820	1845820	Maybe.
1848820	1851820	I do appreciate that they did it line for line and shot for shot again,
1852820	1854820	but I guess you can't get everything right, eh?
1855820	1857820	I came here to steal one of these horses and go.
1858820	1859820	Well, it gave you one.
1860820	1861820	I know.
1862820	1869820	Anyway, that was 30 minutes ago, and I guess you deserve a choice.
1870820	1871820	I still think you'd be better off with Tommy.
1872820	1873820	Let's go.
1874820	1877820	Okay, well, at least they skipped the pointless drama in the middle
1878820	1880820	before they decided to get back together again, I guess.
1881820	1882820	Can I borrow that?
1883820	1885820	Yeah, because Maria took mine, you know.
1886820	1887820	I already said yes, Joel.
1890820	1892820	Couldn't you just give him his gun back?
1893820	1894820	You have some ammo?
1895820	1896820	Well, I guess five rounds is it.
1896820	1897820	That's it.
1902820	1903820	Four.
1903820	1904820	Three.
1904820	1905820	Two.
1907820	1908820	You're flinching.
1908820	1909820	The target's too small.
1909820	1910820	I made it bigger than I should have.
1910820	1911820	Eject the cartridge.
1911820	1912820	I would assume they have more ammo than that.
1913820	1914820	I'm not flinching.
1915820	1916820	The rifle just sucks.
1916820	1917820	Okay, give it.
1919820	1924820	So, I know that they filmed a chunk of the show on the Canadian prairies in the spring.
1924820	1929820	So, I think this is actually happening during Canadian spring.
1930820	1932820	You gonna shoot this thing or get it pregnant?
1934820	1935820	It isn't gonna work.
1935820	1936820	It doesn't aim right.
1938820	1940820	You dick.
1943820	1946820	Now, he would have missed too because he shook the fuck out of that thing
1946820	1947820	like he's scared of the recoil.
1949820	1952820	There's enough snow like in the far background of these shots
1952820	1954820	that I think this is actually...
1955820	1958820	This is like March or April in Canada.
1959820	1960820	Okay.
1983820	1984820	That's right.
1985820	1986820	Houses, stores, that kind of thing.
1986820	1989820	You had the communists and the anarcho-capitalists.
1990820	1992820	And that's all you had in America, apparently.
1993820	1994820	According to him, yeah.
1995820	1997820	He just wanted to grill.
1997820	1998820	We were cool.
1999820	2000820	Everybody loved contractors.
2001820	2002820	Nice.
2002820	2005820	Dude, people fucking hate contractors.
2006820	2007820	Fuck.
2009820	2011820	Well, I mean, get a good one.
2011820	2015820	You hire a contractor 50-50 shot whether or not the job's gonna be done right.
2015820	2016820	Or on time.
2018820	2021820	Good contractor is much like good consultant.
2022820	2023820	Pretty good.
2024820	2026820	Or working communism.
2026820	2027820	Fuck.
2030820	2033820	Yeah, this shot has to be like Alberta or something.
2033820	2034820	Basically.
2035820	2036820	But violent.
2039820	2041820	God, it's so flat it makes my cell hurt.
2044820	2045820	True.
2045820	2047820	But if you're driving down the Trans-Canada,
2047820	2050820	you can go like 200 miles an hour and not hit anything.
2051820	2054820	What, you mean to tell me the entire Canada is trans?
2055820	2056820	Oh, God.
2056820	2057820	God damn it.
2057820	2058820	Reminds me of Denmark.
2058820	2059820	The worst place on Earth.
2061820	2062820	Denmark?
2063820	2065820	It too is ungodly flat.
2067820	2068820	Oh, wow.
2071820	2074820	So I have to assume that like
2075820	2078820	they modeled the university in the game after a real university
2078820	2080820	because that's the university.
2081820	2082820	It could be CGI.
2083820	2084820	Yeah, that's true.
2084820	2086820	Looks a bit CGI.
2087820	2090820	Because I know that the university they used was, I think,
2090820	2092820	was some historical university in...
2095820	2096820	Looks exactly like the game, too.
2096820	2097820	That's pretty incredible.
2109820	2112820	To be fair, that's what I did my first time at university.
2112820	2115820	I wasted like $50,000 on the university.
2115820	2117820	$50,000 in fucking bullshit.
2128820	2133820	The only thing I got out of it was a bunch of wasted money,
2133820	2135820	a World of Warcraft habit,
2135820	2138820	and I became a fucking communist for a few years.
2139820	2140820	An actual communist this time, Arch.
2140820	2142820	Not the fake one you always call me.
2143820	2144820	And then you never stopped.
2146820	2147820	Fair enough.
2147820	2148820	Are those monkeys?
2149820	2150820	Must be from the old labs.
2152820	2153820	First time seeing a monkey.
2155820	2156820	Return the monkey.
2158820	2159820	Ah, yes. Canada.
2160820	2162820	It's a remarkably friendly place for monkeys.
2163820	2164820	Yeah, time to the tree, man.
2165820	2166820	Or at least the bike rack.
2167820	2171820	I do recall reading about one kid who went to university on a horse every day
2171820	2173820	and he actually did tie his horse to the bike rack.
2175820	2178820	So this campus actually isn't the post-apocalypse.
2178820	2180820	It's just after Milo Yiannopoulos gave a speech.
2185820	2188820	Makes me feel old just to hear that reference.
2190820	2192820	Listen, if there's infected up there,
2192820	2195820	the best thing to do is to shout and stand in the light.
2198820	2200820	So at least you have an advantage if they come down.
2201820	2204820	Yeah, but there's not enough time left in the episode to get into any action,
2204820	2207820	so they're gonna have to just find some random dude who stayed behind.
2208820	2210820	So they can kill him in the next episode.
2212820	2215820	Oh wow, you're right. This episode, like, flew by.
2216820	2217820	Yep, it's almost over.
2225820	2226820	Ah, sort of a person.
2231820	2232820	That was the fake-out.
2233820	2234820	Well, at least it ain't clickers.
2241820	2242820	Oh no, it's a band of Negan's.
2246820	2247820	Yeah, put that away.
2248820	2249820	Probably not gonna be here.
2261820	2266820	Listen, he's old and weak, that's why he just snapped that grown man's neck
2266820	2268820	like it was a piece of fucking crinkle bar.
2270820	2273820	Look, he does that, like, 50 times in a game, okay?
2273820	2274820	Oh no.
2275820	2276820	Okay, when did that happen?
2277820	2278820	Don't pull it out.
2278820	2279820	You idiot!
2279820	2280820	I thought that was foolish.
2281820	2284820	Like, you can still ride back to the town.
2290820	2297820	You know, Ellie, this would be a perfect opportunity to just shoot him.
2302820	2304820	Or just, you know, do that.
2305820	2306820	And now he's leaking.
2318820	2319820	Remember, children,
2319820	2323820	if something is keeping your blood inside of you, don't remove it.
2324820	2326820	What the fuck is up with that horse's leg?
2329820	2331820	What the fuck is up with that horse's leg?
2332820	2333820	It's kinda bent, eh?
2334820	2336820	No, the other leg. The other leg is dead straight.
2337820	2338820	Yeah.
2338820	2340820	Well, it's almost like that's his tail.
2341820	2343820	Which is giving it a little bit of optical illusion.
2344820	2345820	Yeah, I'm starting to wonder, like, what?
2346820	2349820	Yep, I saw that too, and I was like, is this a bugged-out video game or something?
2352820	2353820	So, there we go.
2353820	2354820	Well, there you go.
2354820	2355820	Joel's gonna die.
2356820	2359820	I mean, he won't be saved by some random passerby.
2359820	2363820	Doesn't matter, he's gonna get golf-clubbed anyways. Nothing matters.
2364820	2365820	Nihilist, Kibbs.
2366820	2367820	It's all over.
2367820	2368820	It's all over.
2369820	2374820	So, everything about this episode was game-accurate.
2375820	2380820	Except, one, they made the town look more like its Last of Us 2 incarnation than Last of Us 1.
2381820	2386820	Two, they added the woman who's presumably going to become Ellie's girlfriend later, looked just like her.
2387820	2396820	And three, that extra scene with Joel and Tommy having that heart-to-heart where he talks about having panic attacks.
2396820	2402820	And I think that was probably the scene that, you know, ruined the episode for me, I would say.
2403820	2406820	Because it ruined the impact of the Joel and Ellie conversation.
2407820	2408820	I think that's an accurate assessment.
2409820	2413820	It changes the chemistry between Joel and Ellie a lot this episode.
2414820	2419820	And it changes the focus too, which I think is, I think long-term, I think that's detriment.
2420820	2424820	I know, Lilith, you were devil's advocating the other side. Is that how you actually feel?
2424820	2430820	I don't know if it necessarily destroys the dynamic, personally.
2431820	2443820	I think for the viewers, it probably builds it up a bit so it doesn't come across as jarring, that Joel feels like has those PTSD moments, I guess.
2444820	2446820	The thing is, I think jarring was the point of that.
2446820	2454820	The character who has been a cliff, a rock up until this point, suddenly shows a point of humanity and weakness.
2455820	2460820	If he's suddenly bawling over and having bitch fates in the middle of nowhere, that kind of undermines the character.
2461820	2467820	It's not out of nowhere. In the context of the story, it's just a few moments before the scene was-
2468820	2471820	A few moments of being a bitch before he actually has emotions.
2471820	2477820	Again, that's the thing. His character is supposed to be that of the rock, the tough guy.
2478820	2481820	And having that break down for even a moment is a big deal.
2482820	2486820	But if it breaks down like five times in the same episode, it's no longer a big deal.
2487820	2497820	Well, it's also that at this point in the game, the facade of this just being a job has been consistently maintained the whole time.
2497820	2503820	And this is the moment where it breaks just for a second. Here, Arch, you haven't seen the scene, I'm gonna share it with you.
2504820	2507820	It's a two minute scene, it's not a big deal. Just so you know what's going on, okay?
2527820	2528820	Did you say no?
2530820	2538820	Do you even realize what your life means? Huh? Running off like that, putting yourself at risk? It's pretty goddamn stupid.
2539820	2541820	Well, I guess we're both disappointed with each other then.
2542820	2543820	What do you want from me?
2544820	2546820	Admit that you wanted to get rid of me the whole time.
2549820	2550820	Tommy knows this area better than-
2550820	2551820	Oh fuck!
2552820	2554820	Well, I'm sorry. I trust him better than I trust myself.
2554820	2563820	Stop with the bullshit! What are you so afraid of? That I'm gonna end up like Sam? I can't get infected! I can take care of myself!
2563820	2565820	How many close calls have we had?
2565820	2567820	Well, we seem to be doing alright so far.
2567820	2569820	And now you'll be doing even better with Tommy!
2574820	2575820	I'm not her, you know.
2575820	2576820	What?
2577820	2578820	Maria told me about Sarah and-
2578820	2579820	Ellie!
2579820	2580820	And-
2582820	2585820	You are treading on some mighty thin ice here.
2586820	2590820	I'm sorry about your daughter, Joel. But I have lost people too.
2590820	2593820	You have no idea what loss is.
2595820	2599820	Everyone I have cared for has either died or left me.
2601820	2603820	Everyone except for you!
2603820	2610820	So don't tell me that I would be safer with someone else because the truth is I would just be more scared.
2615820	2616820	You're right.
2618820	2619820	You're not my daughter.
2622820	2624820	And I sure as hell ain't your dad.
2626820	2627820	And we are going our separate ways.
2628820	2630820	Get it together! We're not alone.
2631820	2634820	Oh yeah, also a fight scene happens right after because it's a video game, right?
2635820	2646820	But the point of the scene is rather than relying on Joel's insecurity about his own abilities and his aging and his panic attacks and all of this,
2646820	2656820	he maintains the facade that it is just about the job and about who is going to do the job better right up until Ellie mentions his daughter.
2656820	2659820	And that's the one moment where we realize that it's actually not about that at all.
2660820	2669820	And I think that this moment is undermined when you have that big talk between the two brothers in the previous scene.
2670820	2676820	I can see your perspective. The impact seems to be a little bit softened because of that scene.
2677820	2683820	And considering that this is I think probably the fan's favorite scene of the entire game is this moment,
2683820	2689820	I think it's kind of a big deal, at least if you're like a die-hard Last of Us fan, to see it ruined a bit.
2690820	2696820	Just because they wanted to, I don't know, do a very special episode about mental health with Joel. I don't fucking know.
2697820	2700820	I feel like you're getting old. Joel feels like he's getting old.
2701820	2710820	It's very obvious in the television show they are currently doing their best to make sure that Joel is not, well, tough.
2710820	2714820	They are undermining his tough guy character because up until this point he's been a tough guy.
2715820	2718820	And he's been competent and he's done well for himself and he's kept Ellie safe.
2719820	2724820	Now he has panic attacks. He needs to lean over and touch grass occasionally.
2725820	2729820	He's worried about his age and he can't do anything and then he gets stabbed in the gut by a baseball bat somehow.
2730820	2733820	I already watched that fight scene. He did not have an opportunity to stab them there.
2734820	2735820	Now it's just posted.
2735820	2739820	I knew it. I knew that's what I think. I was like, I just don't see it.
2740820	2743820	Yeah, no, he did not have an opportunity to get a stab in on him there.
2744820	2747820	That was one of those shock value, like he got stabbed scenes.
2748820	2756820	The fight was way too goddamn short. There was only one moment in which he could potentially have done it, but his grip was all wrong.
2757820	2760820	He was holding onto the jagged end. There's no way he stabbed it in that deep.
2761820	2763820	How did it happen in the game?
2763820	2773820	Oh, you know what it is? No, he didn't get stabbed. He fell off of a railing in the university and got impaled on something.
2774820	2782820	There's an extended scene where you're fighting with blurry vision and you're stuck to the ground while Ellie has to pry you up and you're shooting guys that are running at you.
2783820	2787820	Yeah, that's right. That's what this was. And that's why he had to pull it out because he was stuck to the ground. He just had to get up.
2787820	2792820	But, I mean, all the other moments were pretty much identical. All the other beats were pretty much the same.
2793820	2802820	Things seemed okay in the show. And you know what? They still tugged at all the right heart strings. I'm sure Twitter is blowing up about it.
2803820	2807820	They probably love it over there. But if you're a purist, I don't think you'll like this episode.
2808820	2813820	That's my final take on it. If any of you guys want to add a little bit more.
2814820	2815820	That's true, sir.
2815820	2818820	I'm kind of on the same page as you, honestly, when it comes to the episode.
2819820	2822820	Alright. Take care, everybody.
2823820	2827820	Little's like, I gotta go eat some fucking meatloaf. I'm done.
2828820	2829820	Food time.
