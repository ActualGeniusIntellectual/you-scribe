00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
As some of you may know from our previous Set Tour videos, we use an Elgato as our primary capture device.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It records in a variety of formats, it's got a dongle for older inputs, and it's slick and cool looking.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But, we've found a fatal flaw in how it works.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We've lost a number of games to this specific bug.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Two sessions of Mario Sunshine, and one session each of Muramasa the Demon Blade, Sonic 3,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Shovel Knight, Legend of Zelda Link to the Past, and Splatoon.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
When you first open up the Elgato's capturing application, it immediately begins recording.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
These files are dumped into a folder with the name given in the software, and consist of .ts files, and a bunch of metadata.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
TS files are just a simple MPEG stream, the same format our camera also records in.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
From what we can tell, when you hit the big record button on the Elgato, it's not actually recording anything.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The Elgato is always recording when the software is open and the Elgato is connected.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What it's doing instead, is making a marker in the metadata that points to a specific time in the TS file.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
When you click the recording off, the program makes a second marker,

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and then begins to convert all the captured footage between the two markers into a .mp4 file,

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
which is what we actually use in our videos.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We learned very early on that all of these TS files build up fairly quickly, and to delete them once the video's been uploaded.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Here's where the problem arises.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If during the last recording session we played a high definition game through an HDMI cable,

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and we're now playing to play a standard definition game through the Elgato's composite dongle,

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
we have to change the input settings and resolution.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But because it's so easy to forget that the Elgato doesn't actually begin recording when you click record,

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
but is always recording from boot up, we actually end up changing resolution and input mid-recording without realizing it.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
In our example, the TS files the Elgato generates are 1920x1080.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But the Elgato software abruptly begins to feed the file 720x480 footage at a different framerate from a different source.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The end result is a garbled mess, with the Elgato trying to compensate for what it perceives to be lost frames and footage

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
by adding random junk frames everywhere, distorting the picture, and making an audio sync impossible.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The solution to this is simple, but really inconvenient, and makes up my only complaint about the Elgato.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
When we start a recording session, and are recording from a console that uses a different set of cables,

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
or plays at a different resolution from our last session, we have to power up the console and Elgato,

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
turn on the software and allow it to begin generating its .ts file,

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
change the resolution and input, causing footage corruption,

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
close the recording software, clear out the newly generated corrupt files,

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and reopen the whole thing again, so that the recording software starts the new .ts files at the proper resolution for our current session.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's a pain to do, and it's honestly a little easy to forget, but at least we've finally figured out what the problem is.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If you happen to use an Elgato for your own stuff, always make sure to reboot the application and clear out your cache of old files

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
any time you have to change the resolution or input.
