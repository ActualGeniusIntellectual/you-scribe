0	6000	As some of you may know from our previous Set Tour videos, we use an Elgato as our primary capture device.
6000	12000	It records in a variety of formats, it's got a dongle for older inputs, and it's slick and cool looking.
12000	15000	But, we've found a fatal flaw in how it works.
15000	18000	We've lost a number of games to this specific bug.
18000	24000	Two sessions of Mario Sunshine, and one session each of Muramasa the Demon Blade, Sonic 3,
24000	27000	Shovel Knight, Legend of Zelda Link to the Past, and Splatoon.
27000	32000	When you first open up the Elgato's capturing application, it immediately begins recording.
32000	38000	These files are dumped into a folder with the name given in the software, and consist of .ts files, and a bunch of metadata.
38000	43000	TS files are just a simple MPEG stream, the same format our camera also records in.
43000	49000	From what we can tell, when you hit the big record button on the Elgato, it's not actually recording anything.
49000	53000	The Elgato is always recording when the software is open and the Elgato is connected.
53000	59000	What it's doing instead, is making a marker in the metadata that points to a specific time in the TS file.
59000	63000	When you click the recording off, the program makes a second marker,
63000	68000	and then begins to convert all the captured footage between the two markers into a .mp4 file,
68000	71000	which is what we actually use in our videos.
71000	78000	We learned very early on that all of these TS files build up fairly quickly, and to delete them once the video's been uploaded.
78000	80000	Here's where the problem arises.
80000	85000	If during the last recording session we played a high definition game through an HDMI cable,
85000	89000	and we're now playing to play a standard definition game through the Elgato's composite dongle,
89000	92000	we have to change the input settings and resolution.
92000	97000	But because it's so easy to forget that the Elgato doesn't actually begin recording when you click record,
97000	104000	but is always recording from boot up, we actually end up changing resolution and input mid-recording without realizing it.
104000	109000	In our example, the TS files the Elgato generates are 1920x1080.
109000	117000	But the Elgato software abruptly begins to feed the file 720x480 footage at a different framerate from a different source.
117000	123000	The end result is a garbled mess, with the Elgato trying to compensate for what it perceives to be lost frames and footage
123000	128000	by adding random junk frames everywhere, distorting the picture, and making an audio sync impossible.
128000	134000	The solution to this is simple, but really inconvenient, and makes up my only complaint about the Elgato.
134000	139000	When we start a recording session, and are recording from a console that uses a different set of cables,
139000	144000	or plays at a different resolution from our last session, we have to power up the console and Elgato,
144000	148000	turn on the software and allow it to begin generating its .ts file,
148000	151000	change the resolution and input, causing footage corruption,
151000	156000	close the recording software, clear out the newly generated corrupt files,
157000	164000	and reopen the whole thing again, so that the recording software starts the new .ts files at the proper resolution for our current session.
164000	170000	It's a pain to do, and it's honestly a little easy to forget, but at least we've finally figured out what the problem is.
170000	177000	If you happen to use an Elgato for your own stuff, always make sure to reboot the application and clear out your cache of old files
177000	179000	any time you have to change the resolution or input.
