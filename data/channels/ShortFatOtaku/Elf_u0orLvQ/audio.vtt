As some of you may know from our previous Set Tour videos, we use an Elgato as our primary capture device.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
It records in a variety of formats, it's got a dongle for older inputs, and it's slick and cool looking.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
But, we've found a fatal flaw in how it works.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
We've lost a number of games to this specific bug.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.000
Two sessions of Mario Sunshine, and one session each of Muramasa the Demon Blade, Sonic 3,

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Shovel Knight, Legend of Zelda Link to the Past, and Splatoon.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
When you first open up the Elgato's capturing application, it immediately begins recording.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
These files are dumped into a folder with the name given in the software, and consist of .ts files, and a bunch of metadata.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
TS files are just a simple MPEG stream, the same format our camera also records in.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
From what we can tell, when you hit the big record button on the Elgato, it's not actually recording anything.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
The Elgato is always recording when the software is open and the Elgato is connected.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
What it's doing instead, is making a marker in the metadata that points to a specific time in the TS file.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
When you click the recording off, the program makes a second marker,

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
and then begins to convert all the captured footage between the two markers into a .mp4 file,

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
which is what we actually use in our videos.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
We learned very early on that all of these TS files build up fairly quickly, and to delete them once the video's been uploaded.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Here's where the problem arises.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
If during the last recording session we played a high definition game through an HDMI cable,

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
and we're now playing to play a standard definition game through the Elgato's composite dongle,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
we have to change the input settings and resolution.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
But because it's so easy to forget that the Elgato doesn't actually begin recording when you click record,

01:37.000 --> 01:44.000
but is always recording from boot up, we actually end up changing resolution and input mid-recording without realizing it.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
In our example, the TS files the Elgato generates are 1920x1080.

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
But the Elgato software abruptly begins to feed the file 720x480 footage at a different framerate from a different source.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
The end result is a garbled mess, with the Elgato trying to compensate for what it perceives to be lost frames and footage

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
by adding random junk frames everywhere, distorting the picture, and making an audio sync impossible.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
The solution to this is simple, but really inconvenient, and makes up my only complaint about the Elgato.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
When we start a recording session, and are recording from a console that uses a different set of cables,

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
or plays at a different resolution from our last session, we have to power up the console and Elgato,

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
turn on the software and allow it to begin generating its .ts file,

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
change the resolution and input, causing footage corruption,

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
close the recording software, clear out the newly generated corrupt files,

02:37.000 --> 02:44.000
and reopen the whole thing again, so that the recording software starts the new .ts files at the proper resolution for our current session.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
It's a pain to do, and it's honestly a little easy to forget, but at least we've finally figured out what the problem is.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
If you happen to use an Elgato for your own stuff, always make sure to reboot the application and clear out your cache of old files

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
any time you have to change the resolution or input.
