0	4820	Yesterday was World Hijab Day. I bet most of you didn't know because most average people don't give a shit.
4820	8580	However, I figured it out because of this article posted on the CBC.
8580	11740	You're invited to try on the hijab for World Hijab Day.
11740	15700	There are booths at Windsor Regional Hospital where people can learn about the hijab.
15740	21120	Maybe this goes without saying, but I don't think that it's the place of state-sponsored news organizations
21120	25580	like the CBC to be promoting any particular religious viewpoint, not just Islam.
25580	31080	I have yet to see an article inviting people to put on Christian crucifixes, hold Buddhist prayer beads,
31080	34080	or wear those Jewish coffee filter looking hats.
34080	36080	I don't know what they're called, I'm sorry.
36080	39580	My point is, why is this a privilege reserved only for Islam?
39580	43580	If there actually is a World Crucifix Day or whatever, I've never seen it.
43580	48080	But you can bet your ass that World Hijab Day gets plastered all over social media when it hits.
48080	51080	Windsor Regional Hospital is celebrating World Hijab Day,
51080	56080	a day marked since 2013 to encourage women of all backgrounds to try on a hijab.
56080	61080	The hospital's diversity committee will have booths set up at the Met and Ouellette campuses
61080	65580	explaining why the hijab is worn and visitors will be invited to try one on.
65580	69580	For those of you who don't know, the hijab is not actually just the headscarf.
69580	74080	It's a full method of dressing modestly for one's Islamic religious convictions.
74080	78580	Simply slapping a scarf over the hair of a non-believer is not hijab.
78580	85580	And frankly, the reason why more Muslims probably aren't offended at the watering down of their religious practices in this way
85580	91580	is because unlike most other religions, Islam is just as much a political system as it is a spiritual one
91580	95580	and even its less than orthodox advancement serves that purpose.
95580	98580	Both women started wearing the hijab at around 6th grade.
98580	102080	The hijab is worn by women reaching sexual maturity in Islam.
102080	106080	It's a symbol from the woman's father that she is ready to be married off and start a family.
106080	109080	Grade 6 in Canada is around 11 years old.
109080	115080	Maybe it's because these women are obviously Canadian, westernized Muslims, and so they might not know this.
115080	120080	But wearing the hijab at 11 is the cultural variant of wearing makeup at 11.
120080	125080	It's a social signal, recognizable by Muslim men, that the wearer is ready for sexual activity.
125080	132080	And while the cynic in me wants to say that Muslims know exactly what they're doing when they advertise the sexual availability of children,
132080	135580	I'm really hoping these two are just ignorant about their own religion.
135580	138580	A lot of times we think about people being pressured to wear the hijab,
138580	142580	but I think over here in Canada, the trend is actually people tell you not to wear it.
142580	143580	I wonder why that is.
143580	148580	I wonder why your average, everyday Canadian sees the hijab as a symbol of brutal oppression,
148580	152580	legitimate misogyny, and middle-age-era religious superstition.
152580	156580	Maybe it's because in every Islamic country in the world, wearing the hijab is not a free choice,
156580	161580	nor is it empowering, but instead it's state enforced on the entire population.
161580	165580	Maybe it's because women who take off the hijab in Iran regularly get arrested.
165580	174580	When I wear hijab, it's like I'm restricted, I'm oppressed, but when I don't wear hijab, it's like I'm free.
174580	184580	I was moving that white flag for five, six minutes, and the police car came and they arrested me.
184580	187580	Maybe it's because the Saudi Arabian guardianship program
187580	191580	means that women can't do anything outside of the house without a male escort.
191580	196580	Me and my sisters escaped from Saudi Arabia to protect ourselves from getting trialed,
196580	201580	or committing apostasy from Islam, which is punished by death in my country.
201580	210580	World Hijab Day is an insult to a lot of women who do not have the choice to take off their hijab in public,
210580	216580	where they could get prison time, they could get beaten up by their own family members.
216580	224580	I'm from Saudi Arabia, and I am an atheist Saudi woman who escaped to Canada two months ago.
224580	237580	There is a lot of atheist Saudi women, but they can't speak because they are oppressed and Sharia law in Saudi Arabia.
237580	245580	One of the first most depressing days that I had on social media was learning that there was something called Hijab Day,
245580	257580	where free women would put this hijab on, thinking that it makes them in solidarity with Muslim women.
257580	263580	Maybe it's because Western women like you two, comfortably living in Canada, talking about the freedom to wear the hijab,
263580	268580	provide ideological cover for repressive Islamist regimes to go on oppressing millions of women,
268580	275580	because you don't understand that the only reason you have the choice to wear the hijab or not is because of liberal democracy.
275580	280580	If it were left solely up to Islam, you would not have the choice that you claim as empowering.
280580	287580	And if the empowerment doesn't come from Islam, but exists in spite of it, then maybe your religion isn't empowering at all.
287580	290580	And in fact, I think these women understand this to some degree.
290580	295580	She said she's had to explain that it's so liberal in Canada that there's no pressure.
295580	302580	So the fact that I am wearing it shows I'm doing it of my own will, she said, who feels wearing one is a representation of her true self.
302580	308580	And that's fine. I'm actually okay with people wearing the hijab, or any clothing at all really, in the public space,
308580	315580	as long as it's not a safety risk, like you shouldn't be able to wear it during an ID photo or in lieu of a helmet on a motorcycle or something.
315580	318580	The same rules should apply to everyone regardless of faith.
318580	321580	But if you're just going to the grocery store wearing the hijab, I don't care.
321580	325580	But why does there need to be an initiative to encourage non-Muslim women to wear it?
325580	331580	Well, that's a question that this article, inviting people to try the hijab on, never actually asks.
331580	336580	The entire thing is just an advertisement for World Hijab Day, plus the personal reasons for these women for wearing it.
336580	338580	Nothing about why the kafir should join in.
338580	342580	The answer to that question, though, is rooted in that political side of Islam.
342580	348580	The side that the religious and cultural aspects provide ideological cover for, in the same way that these Canadianized girls do.
348580	354580	For example, in March 2018, UCLA held an open-air prayer session for the university's students.
354580	357580	And this is what happened when somebody tried to record it.
372580	386580	Excuse me. I'm the president of the organization. Chris, you can only make video if you're with media.
386580	389580	I'm going to have to call security on you unless you talk to me.
389580	393580	I'm going to call U.C.P.D. right now if you don't stop right now and then delete it.
393580	396580	How's it going? I hope you're doing well today.
396580	398580	We really do hope you're having a beautiful day.
398580	405580	You know, we're very happy to see you. We really love to work with you, but we really just want to understand what's going on.
405580	406580	Are you okay, sir?
406580	409580	Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah.
409580	413580	Sir, is something okay? Do we need to call someone a medical team for you?
413580	418580	It's no surprise to me that these two tried to stop the recording, despite it being held in public
418580	421580	and the United States having a very robust freedom of the press.
421580	425580	It's because this isn't only a religious event, and the people involved are at least somewhat politically savvy.
425580	431580	This wasn't held in a mosque, or in the university's prayer room, or even in an auditorium if large numbers were the problem.
431580	435580	It was on one of the campus lawns, with a loudspeaker broadcasting the prayer.
435580	439580	This seems to me like it was as much a political statement as it was a religious one.
439580	442580	And it's this kind of thing that outlines the problem of Islam in the West.
442580	450580	It's one thing to have Westernized Muslims, born and raised here, enjoying the religious and cultural practices that they determine are wanted in their lives.
450580	457580	It's another thing entirely to import Muslims from the Middle East, who would want to see the political practices of their new home change to look more like their old home.
457580	461580	The former is just fine, the latter is a direct attack on liberal democracy.
461580	471580	And the worst part is, as the second group swells in size, the first group increasingly provides ideological cover for them, often unknowingly, until they ultimately get swallowed up.
471580	478580	And progressives are happy to stroll right into the maw of death with them, because they are willfully blind about the distinction between both groups.
478580	487580	That's why you get nonsense like LGBT against Islamophobia, despite many Muslims being entirely willing to toss these people off a rooftop for their sins.
491580	499580	That's why there is a portion of Western Muslims radicalizing over time, using social justice rhetoric to justify Islam's repressive practices.
499580	508580	And that's why radical lefties, ignorant about the two different types of Muslim, persist on calling Islamophobia racism and characterizing criticism of Islam as a hate crime.
508580	511580	Caught in the middle of all this are the ex-Muslim refugees.
511580	517580	These are people who fled from the religious oppression of various Islamic states to the West, hoping to start a new life.
517580	525580	But when they get here, they find SJWs and globalist lefty governments openly embracing the barbarism that they risked their lives to escape from.
525580	534580	And if they're really unlucky, they might even bump into the ISIS fighters that once bought and sold them as sex slaves, now living as refugees in their own right.
555580	565580	I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim.
565580	575580	I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim.
575580	594580	I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim.
594580	610580	I have a wife and a wife who are not my children. I am not a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim.
624580	642580	I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim.
642580	650580	I don't want the friendly, try-on-the-hijab attitude to shift to all women must wear headscarves in solidarity with Muslims like in Austria.
650580	656580	I don't want Muslim grooming gangs like in basically every European country now.
656580	661580	I don't want Canadian gay youths to be stabbed to death while begging for their lives like in Iraq.
661580	668580	And I don't want ex-Muslims, atheists, and other non-believers to face violence and abuse like the world over.
668580	678580	Social justice warriors and feminists rant and rave about the Handmaid's Tale in the West and how those iconic robes and bonnets are symbols of a government that reduces women to property.
678580	685580	But even as they dress up in those fictional symbols as protest, they turn a blind eye to their non-fiction counterpart, the hijab.
685580	694580	It would seem like progressives are more worried about fantasy misogyny than actual misogyny. If that weren't the case, they'd be just as horrified at World Hijab Day as I am.
694580	724580	I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I
724580	754580	would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like
754580	784580	to say that I would like
784580	814580	to say that
814580	824530	I would like to say that
