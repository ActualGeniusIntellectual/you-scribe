00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
Yesterday was World Hijab Day. I bet most of you didn't know because most average people don't give a shit.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,580
However, I figured it out because of this article posted on the CBC.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,740
You're invited to try on the hijab for World Hijab Day.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,700
There are booths at Windsor Regional Hospital where people can learn about the hijab.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,120
Maybe this goes without saying, but I don't think that it's the place of state-sponsored news organizations

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,580
like the CBC to be promoting any particular religious viewpoint, not just Islam.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,080
I have yet to see an article inviting people to put on Christian crucifixes, hold Buddhist prayer beads,

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,080
or wear those Jewish coffee filter looking hats.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,080
I don't know what they're called, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,580
My point is, why is this a privilege reserved only for Islam?

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,580
If there actually is a World Crucifix Day or whatever, I've never seen it.

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,080
But you can bet your ass that World Hijab Day gets plastered all over social media when it hits.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Windsor Regional Hospital is celebrating World Hijab Day,

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,080
a day marked since 2013 to encourage women of all backgrounds to try on a hijab.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,080
The hospital's diversity committee will have booths set up at the Met and Ouellette campuses

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,580
explaining why the hijab is worn and visitors will be invited to try one on.

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,580
For those of you who don't know, the hijab is not actually just the headscarf.

18
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,080
It's a full method of dressing modestly for one's Islamic religious convictions.

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,580
Simply slapping a scarf over the hair of a non-believer is not hijab.

20
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:25,580
And frankly, the reason why more Muslims probably aren't offended at the watering down of their religious practices in this way

21
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,580
is because unlike most other religions, Islam is just as much a political system as it is a spiritual one

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,580
and even its less than orthodox advancement serves that purpose.

23
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,580
Both women started wearing the hijab at around 6th grade.

24
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,080
The hijab is worn by women reaching sexual maturity in Islam.

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,080
It's a symbol from the woman's father that she is ready to be married off and start a family.

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,080
Grade 6 in Canada is around 11 years old.

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Maybe it's because these women are obviously Canadian, westernized Muslims, and so they might not know this.

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,080
But wearing the hijab at 11 is the cultural variant of wearing makeup at 11.

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,080
It's a social signal, recognizable by Muslim men, that the wearer is ready for sexual activity.

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:12,080
And while the cynic in me wants to say that Muslims know exactly what they're doing when they advertise the sexual availability of children,

31
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,580
I'm really hoping these two are just ignorant about their own religion.

32
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,580
A lot of times we think about people being pressured to wear the hijab,

33
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,580
but I think over here in Canada, the trend is actually people tell you not to wear it.

34
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,580
I wonder why that is.

35
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,580
I wonder why your average, everyday Canadian sees the hijab as a symbol of brutal oppression,

36
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,580
legitimate misogyny, and middle-age-era religious superstition.

37
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,580
Maybe it's because in every Islamic country in the world, wearing the hijab is not a free choice,

38
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,580
nor is it empowering, but instead it's state enforced on the entire population.

39
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,580
Maybe it's because women who take off the hijab in Iran regularly get arrested.

40
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:54,580
When I wear hijab, it's like I'm restricted, I'm oppressed, but when I don't wear hijab, it's like I'm free.

41
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:04,580
I was moving that white flag for five, six minutes, and the police car came and they arrested me.

42
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,580
Maybe it's because the Saudi Arabian guardianship program

43
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,580
means that women can't do anything outside of the house without a male escort.

44
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,580
Me and my sisters escaped from Saudi Arabia to protect ourselves from getting trialed,

45
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,580
or committing apostasy from Islam, which is punished by death in my country.

46
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:30,580
World Hijab Day is an insult to a lot of women who do not have the choice to take off their hijab in public,

47
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:36,580
where they could get prison time, they could get beaten up by their own family members.

48
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:44,580
I'm from Saudi Arabia, and I am an atheist Saudi woman who escaped to Canada two months ago.

49
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:57,580
There is a lot of atheist Saudi women, but they can't speak because they are oppressed and Sharia law in Saudi Arabia.

50
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:05,580
One of the first most depressing days that I had on social media was learning that there was something called Hijab Day,

51
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:17,580
where free women would put this hijab on, thinking that it makes them in solidarity with Muslim women.

52
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:23,580
Maybe it's because Western women like you two, comfortably living in Canada, talking about the freedom to wear the hijab,

53
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,580
provide ideological cover for repressive Islamist regimes to go on oppressing millions of women,

54
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:35,580
because you don't understand that the only reason you have the choice to wear the hijab or not is because of liberal democracy.

55
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,580
If it were left solely up to Islam, you would not have the choice that you claim as empowering.

56
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:47,580
And if the empowerment doesn't come from Islam, but exists in spite of it, then maybe your religion isn't empowering at all.

57
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,580
And in fact, I think these women understand this to some degree.

58
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,580
She said she's had to explain that it's so liberal in Canada that there's no pressure.

59
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:02,580
So the fact that I am wearing it shows I'm doing it of my own will, she said, who feels wearing one is a representation of her true self.

60
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,580
And that's fine. I'm actually okay with people wearing the hijab, or any clothing at all really, in the public space,

61
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:15,580
as long as it's not a safety risk, like you shouldn't be able to wear it during an ID photo or in lieu of a helmet on a motorcycle or something.

62
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,580
The same rules should apply to everyone regardless of faith.

63
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,580
But if you're just going to the grocery store wearing the hijab, I don't care.

64
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,580
But why does there need to be an initiative to encourage non-Muslim women to wear it?

65
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:31,580
Well, that's a question that this article, inviting people to try the hijab on, never actually asks.

66
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,580
The entire thing is just an advertisement for World Hijab Day, plus the personal reasons for these women for wearing it.

67
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,580
Nothing about why the kafir should join in.

68
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,580
The answer to that question, though, is rooted in that political side of Islam.

69
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,580
The side that the religious and cultural aspects provide ideological cover for, in the same way that these Canadianized girls do.

70
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,580
For example, in March 2018, UCLA held an open-air prayer session for the university's students.

71
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,580
And this is what happened when somebody tried to record it.

72
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:26,580
Excuse me. I'm the president of the organization. Chris, you can only make video if you're with media.

73
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,580
I'm going to have to call security on you unless you talk to me.

74
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,580
I'm going to call U.C.P.D. right now if you don't stop right now and then delete it.

75
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,580
How's it going? I hope you're doing well today.

76
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,580
We really do hope you're having a beautiful day.

77
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:45,580
You know, we're very happy to see you. We really love to work with you, but we really just want to understand what's going on.

78
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,580
Are you okay, sir?

79
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,580
Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah.

80
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,580
Sir, is something okay? Do we need to call someone a medical team for you?

81
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,580
It's no surprise to me that these two tried to stop the recording, despite it being held in public

82
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,580
and the United States having a very robust freedom of the press.

83
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,580
It's because this isn't only a religious event, and the people involved are at least somewhat politically savvy.

84
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:11,580
This wasn't held in a mosque, or in the university's prayer room, or even in an auditorium if large numbers were the problem.

85
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,580
It was on one of the campus lawns, with a loudspeaker broadcasting the prayer.

86
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,580
This seems to me like it was as much a political statement as it was a religious one.

87
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,580
And it's this kind of thing that outlines the problem of Islam in the West.

88
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:30,580
It's one thing to have Westernized Muslims, born and raised here, enjoying the religious and cultural practices that they determine are wanted in their lives.

89
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:37,580
It's another thing entirely to import Muslims from the Middle East, who would want to see the political practices of their new home change to look more like their old home.

90
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,580
The former is just fine, the latter is a direct attack on liberal democracy.

91
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:51,580
And the worst part is, as the second group swells in size, the first group increasingly provides ideological cover for them, often unknowingly, until they ultimately get swallowed up.

92
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:58,580
And progressives are happy to stroll right into the maw of death with them, because they are willfully blind about the distinction between both groups.

93
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:07,580
That's why you get nonsense like LGBT against Islamophobia, despite many Muslims being entirely willing to toss these people off a rooftop for their sins.

94
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:19,580
That's why there is a portion of Western Muslims radicalizing over time, using social justice rhetoric to justify Islam's repressive practices.

95
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:28,580
And that's why radical lefties, ignorant about the two different types of Muslim, persist on calling Islamophobia racism and characterizing criticism of Islam as a hate crime.

96
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,580
Caught in the middle of all this are the ex-Muslim refugees.

97
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:37,580
These are people who fled from the religious oppression of various Islamic states to the West, hoping to start a new life.

98
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:45,580
But when they get here, they find SJWs and globalist lefty governments openly embracing the barbarism that they risked their lives to escape from.

99
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:54,580
And if they're really unlucky, they might even bump into the ISIS fighters that once bought and sold them as sex slaves, now living as refugees in their own right.

100
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:25,580
I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim.

101
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:35,580
I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim.

102
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:54,580
I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim.

103
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:10,580
I have a wife and a wife who are not my children. I am not a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim.

104
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:42,580
I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim.

105
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:50,580
I don't want the friendly, try-on-the-hijab attitude to shift to all women must wear headscarves in solidarity with Muslims like in Austria.

106
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,580
I don't want Muslim grooming gangs like in basically every European country now.

107
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,580
I don't want Canadian gay youths to be stabbed to death while begging for their lives like in Iraq.

108
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:08,580
And I don't want ex-Muslims, atheists, and other non-believers to face violence and abuse like the world over.

109
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:18,580
Social justice warriors and feminists rant and rave about the Handmaid's Tale in the West and how those iconic robes and bonnets are symbols of a government that reduces women to property.

110
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:25,580
But even as they dress up in those fictional symbols as protest, they turn a blind eye to their non-fiction counterpart, the hijab.

111
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:34,580
It would seem like progressives are more worried about fantasy misogyny than actual misogyny. If that weren't the case, they'd be just as horrified at World Hijab Day as I am.

112
00:11:34,580 --> 00:12:04,580
I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I

113
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:34,580
would like to say that I would like to say that I would like to say that I would like

114
00:12:34,580 --> 00:13:04,580
to say that I would like

115
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:34,580
to say that

116
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:44,530
I would like to say that
