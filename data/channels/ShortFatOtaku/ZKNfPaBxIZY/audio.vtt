00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
Hey guys, can you hear that rain?

00:04.600 --> 00:08.040
Let's see if you can see it.

00:08.040 --> 00:12.800
It's quite a lot of rain.

00:12.800 --> 00:17.000
This is just a view from the garden from the second floor of the house.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.680
I'm hanging out the window to do this.

00:19.680 --> 00:25.680
The reason I'm doing this is because the power went out.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.400
Yep, recording us on the phone.

00:28.400 --> 00:35.000
So if you don't see a video from me today, this would be why.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.200
The garden is good to go for planting, which happens in a week or two.

00:40.200 --> 00:45.940
But if the power doesn't come back on, I can't do a video today.

00:45.940 --> 00:48.280
So I'll just upload this by phone, I guess.

00:48.280 --> 00:51.720
I will say though, the sound of rain is quite nice, isn't it?

00:51.720 --> 00:54.400
Just to listen to it.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.400
Yeah.

00:57.400 --> 01:02.200
Alright guys, I'll see you next time.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.200
I love you.
