Hey guys, can you hear that rain?
Let's see if you can see it.
It's quite a lot of rain.
This is just a view from the garden from the second floor of the house.
I'm hanging out the window to do this.
The reason I'm doing this is because the power went out.
Yep, recording us on the phone.
So if you don't see a video from me today, this would be why.
The garden is good to go for planting, which happens in a week or two.
But if the power doesn't come back on, I can't do a video today.
So I'll just upload this by phone, I guess.
I will say though, the sound of rain is quite nice, isn't it?
Just to listen to it.
Yeah.
Alright guys, I'll see you next time.
I love you.
