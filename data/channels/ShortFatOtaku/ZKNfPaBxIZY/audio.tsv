0	4600	Hey guys, can you hear that rain?
4600	8040	Let's see if you can see it.
8040	12800	It's quite a lot of rain.
12800	17000	This is just a view from the garden from the second floor of the house.
17000	19680	I'm hanging out the window to do this.
19680	25680	The reason I'm doing this is because the power went out.
25680	28400	Yep, recording us on the phone.
28400	35000	So if you don't see a video from me today, this would be why.
35000	40200	The garden is good to go for planting, which happens in a week or two.
40200	45940	But if the power doesn't come back on, I can't do a video today.
45940	48280	So I'll just upload this by phone, I guess.
48280	51720	I will say though, the sound of rain is quite nice, isn't it?
51720	54400	Just to listen to it.
54400	56400	Yeah.
57400	62200	Alright guys, I'll see you next time.
62200	64200	I love you.
