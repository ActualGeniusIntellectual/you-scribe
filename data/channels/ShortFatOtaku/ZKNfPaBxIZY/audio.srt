00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
Hey guys, can you hear that rain?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,040
Let's see if you can see it.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,800
It's quite a lot of rain.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,000
This is just a view from the garden from the second floor of the house.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,680
I'm hanging out the window to do this.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,680
The reason I'm doing this is because the power went out.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,400
Yep, recording us on the phone.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,000
So if you don't see a video from me today, this would be why.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,200
The garden is good to go for planting, which happens in a week or two.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,940
But if the power doesn't come back on, I can't do a video today.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,280
So I'll just upload this by phone, I guess.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,720
I will say though, the sound of rain is quite nice, isn't it?

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,400
Just to listen to it.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,400
Yeah.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,200
Alright guys, I'll see you next time.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
I love you.
