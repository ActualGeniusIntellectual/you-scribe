0	2660	This is going to be one of those Dev Thinks videos.
2660	7100	No goofy TikToks, no ridiculous headlines, no Twitter morons, at least for the most part.
7100	10000	But we can start off with a bit of drama to get the ball rolling.
10000	29600	["The
30600	34000	This has led to many, many long hours of discussion on the topic.
34000	36200	Not all of it is necessarily worth watching, frankly.
36200	38800	No offense to either of these guys, but this is a lot of dead horse beating.
38800	43200	For the sake of brevity, I will give you the clip that I think encapsulates the situation perfectly.
43200	50000	So they'll be like this position, this position, this position, this position, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this.
50000	55800	So these are like the political positions that people have, and these are the things that I'm most interested in arguing with.
55800	56800	This is what I want to fight about.
56800	60500	I want to fight about what you think about that, or what you think about this, or what you think about that.
60500	65700	But people seem more concerned with like, can we group all of these together and call them this?
65700	68700	The problem is that this is one definition of Nazi.
68700	70300	It might include these traits.
70300	72200	Here's another definition of Nazi.
72200	74000	It might include like these traits.
74000	76800	Here's another definition of Nazi.
76800	79000	It might include like these traits.
79000	80400	Here's another definition of Nazi.
80400	82300	Might include, eh, we'll say these traits.
82300	83800	Maybe it encompasses something else here.
83800	87000	And people are fighting over like, what's your definition of Nazi?
87000	89700	And this is, this is the entire conversation of the sub.
89700	90300	Is it this?
90300	90900	Is it that?
90900	91200	Where?
91200	92600	Why would you call him this if he meets it?
92600	94900	If he, well, he did this, he said that, and he did this, and he's like, okay, hold on.
96700	99000	I don't, I don't care about any of this.
99000	100700	I just want to focus on these things.
100700	101600	This is what I talk about.
101600	102700	This is what I do.
102700	107800	I'm not interested in like giving you a particular political label or assigning you or ascribing to you some shit.
107800	113600	I don't really care because the problem is that when I use this definition, let's say that I define Nazi like this.
113600	122100	Okay, what you really want is you want this and this thing right here is your moral condemnation.
122300	123700	That's what you're looking for.
124100	129200	People are looking for this thing, which is bad Nazi bad.
129400	130500	This is what you want.
130800	140500	And the problem that people are running into, you might not realize this, but the problem that you're running into is that I'll talk about this and I'll talk about that and I'll talk about this and I'm at and you're like, no, no, no, no, no.
140700	142100	I need you to call him a Nazi.
142600	146100	And when you call him a Nazi, you're pretending that it's because we'll look destiny.
146200	150000	He's got this and that and that and that is, you know, see, you don't care about that though.
150200	152400	What you really want is you want this.
153100	153700	That's what you want.
153700	155100	You want the moral condemnation.
155100	156300	That's all you're concerned about.
156300	159000	And this thing here is the last thing in the world.
159000	167000	I care about I don't give a fuck about this thing because to include this thing already excludes anybody that would consider themselves any of these things.
167100	169000	They're necessarily not going to see themselves as evil.
169100	171200	They're obviously because they are they believe these things.
171600	181400	But it's telling because we'll agree on this and we'll agree on that and we'll agree on this and we'll agree on that and then you'll get mad pretending that I'm not grouping these things together.
181400	182800	You're like, why would you just call him a thing?
182900	185500	It's like, well, who why do you care if I if we already agree on this shit?
185600	186900	Why do you care if I call him a thing or not?
187000	189600	And like because you're obfuscating because you're hiding what he really is.
189900	191000	Well, what am I hiding?
191100	195200	If I agree on this tell me for Nick Fuentes and this would be a challenge to the subreddit.
195300	200800	What am I hiding about Nick Fuentes when I'm calling him this this or this or this or this and the answer is like, well, you won't call a Nazi.
200800	207000	Why do you care if I don't call him a Nazi if I identify with this person and the real reason is because you want this you want this here.
207200	210100	This is what I'm hiding by not calling him a Nazi.
210200	212700	I'm not including that he is evil or bad part.
212800	216600	That's the issue but that's just the part that I don't really care about.
216700	217500	I don't care about this.
217600	218800	I just don't really give a fuck about it.
218900	226800	This state of affairs is largely due to the overuse and misuse of terms like Nazi and fascist to the point that the words have been destroyed at least online.
226900	229800	They now only refer to whatever the speaker considers to be evil.
229800	239700	An example given repeatedly in these convos was when Vosch called President Bush or Justice Scalia fascists, even though they really don't have anything that makes them fascists except for Vosch's hatred.
239800	241800	How are Bush or Scalia a fascist?
241900	247500	So with Scalia, I would need to go back over the case rulings that he's given because I don't have a great memory for the judicial stuff.
247600	248300	I said that earlier.
248400	255800	I'd be happy to come back with a lot more arguments because this is stuff that I have to remember from podcasts that I've listened to and articles that I've read and conversations that I've had.
255800	260500	With Bush, I think the argument is a lot more direct and it's obviously something I remember a little bit more directly.
260600	276200	I think that Bush, the obvious ones, the straightforward ones are obviously the 2020 election and a nepotistic relationship between George Bush and a person already in power in order to undemocratically secure an election to which he otherwise probably didn't have a right.
276300	282500	I think that's definitely in line at least with the anti-democratic element of fascism, though it's nowhere near as overt as what Trump did, of course.
282600	285300	I'll get back to this in a second, but I've got to throw some books at you.
285300	287000	I won't go into super detail on any of them.
287100	290200	They're each deserving a video on their own that maybe I'll have time to give you one day.
290300	293300	I just want you to know what kind of rabbit hole I've gone down recently.
293400	302100	There was a pretty big event in this channel's history about a year ago that I know y'all know about which motivated me to read a stack of literature on fascism in an effort to understand the ideology.
302200	310300	The beginning point of this journey was me nagging Sargon to read Zeeb Sternhell's Neither Right Nor Left which he eventually did and made a book club video on with Callum.
310300	318000	The TLDR is, Sternhell was a historian and a Polish-born Jewish Holocaust survivor who, after the war, devoted himself to studying fascism.
318100	325200	Neither Right Nor Left is primarily a history book and it pins the origins of fascism not on Germany or Italy but instead on France,
325300	335700	specifically out of the ideas of the French socialist and syndicalist George Sorel who envisioned a pairing of nationalism with the revolutionary left as the task was not a revolt against the bourgeois of Marx's time,
335700	343300	the nationalist-oriented nobility and its elected leadership but instead against an internationalist capitalist bureaucratic class of globalist elites.
343400	348600	It was this Sorelian socialism that became the ideological basis for Mussolini's fascism.
348700	352300	That opened the floodgates for me and I began to look at multiple other positions on fascism.
352400	357400	The mass psychology of fascism is an analysis of fascism from a psychological and socialist perspective.
357400	371200	Wilhelm Reich, as a Freudian, traced the support for fascism among the working class back to sexual repression and advocated for a cultural shift towards total sexual openness and the complete dispensing with traditional sexual morality in order to combat fascist tendencies.
371300	382800	As a direct continuation of Reich's work, the Italian communist Mario Mielli penned the pamphlet Towards a Queer Communism where he advocated making love to children to desensitize them to sex as a form of anti-fascism.
382800	390200	Meanwhile, Hayek's The Road to Serfdom is a discussion of fascism from a libertarian point of view, focusing specifically on fascist economics.
390300	395500	His argument was that when the individual loses the ability to make economic choices for themselves as a result of central planning,
395600	401600	what inevitably follows is a total loss of freedom, the creation of an oppressive society, the tyranny of a dictator, and the serfdom of the individual.
401700	410300	Hayek wrote in the context of an era where the popular view of fascism was that it was a capitalist reaction against socialism, something that Lenin popularized with this famous quote,
410300	412200	Fascism is capitalism in decay.
412300	420300	Liberal writers would eventually take up positions closer to Hayek's than Reich's, all drawing comparisons between the socialism of the Soviet Union and the fascism of the Axis powers.
420400	422500	There's two books that serve as foils for each other.
422600	426300	The first is The Wages of Destruction by Adam Tooze, an open communist.
426400	429800	The second is Hitler's Beneficiaries by Goetz Ali, a German historian.
429900	436900	They both examine the domestic economic policies of Nazi Germany, with Ali saying that the socialism of national socialism was not simply propaganda,
436900	443500	but was actually reflected in the extreme amount of social mobility and wealth that the German working class gained from the Nazis in order to keep them complacent,
443600	447900	while Tooze naturally rejects Ali's conception of this as real socialism.
448000	454800	They actually entered into a fun back and forth for a while, editing new footnotes into subsequent editions of their books to respond to the claims of the other.
454900	456600	It's like shitposting in the fine print.
456700	461800	The most notable thing I've read recently was Fascist Interactions by Professor David Roberts of the University of Georgia.
461900	466700	Roberts asserts that fascist studies stagnated for decades because academics had stopped reading what the fascists themselves were writing.
466700	470400	Under the pretense that fascists always lie, so reading their political theory is useless.
470500	477700	Instead, academics were often encouraged by their peers to read other people's interpretations of fascism, generally socialist interpretations, and take it as gospel,
477800	485700	even to the point that social stigma began to develop in the academy if you wanted to look at fascism through a non-socialist lens or read fascist writers for yourselves.
485800	490900	According to Roberts, fascist studies only began to make breakthroughs again when this tendency was finally shook off,
491000	494700	and academics actually began listening to what fascists had to say about themselves.
494700	498700	After Roberts, I decided the next best thing was to follow his advice and read some of the fascists.
498800	504000	Mein Kampf by Hitler, which even taking the morality of the subject matter out of it, is a horrible slog to get through.
504100	505200	Hitler was a terrible writer.
505300	510400	The Doctrine of Fascism by Mussolini and the similarly named Political Doctrine of Fascism by Alfredo Rocco
510500	516300	both functioned more as manifestos to be handed out and easily consumed, and less as full political science texts.
516400	524000	Revolt Against the Modern World by Julius Evola, who famously declared at his post-World War II trial that Italian fascism was not fascist enough for him,
524000	525500	and so he was a super-fascist.
525600	527400	Let me tell you, there's so many people out there.
527500	532900	While I've learned a lot having read just this much stuff about fascism, I think on some level destiny is correct.
533000	537900	Demanding that you use an emotionally charged term like fascist isn't about the ideas behind the word,
538000	542100	but the moral condemnation attached to it, and the word itself has become meaningless.
542200	546400	Which is a shame, because the ideas of all of these people need a way to properly describe them.
546500	552700	On Destiny's subreddit, this very long thread was posted, describing a highly academic definition of the word Nazi, and why Nick Fuentes doesn't fit the bill.
552700	558600	The issue with this is, despite it being accurate, it also means that, per this definition, there's pretty much no Nazis today.
558700	563200	Now, I'm okay with that. I can just let the Nazi label fade into history, personally.
563300	565800	But a lot of people can't. For them, it's too politically useful.
576900	582600	I've come to believe that there's actually three separate things that we refer to whenever we use the word Nazi or fascist.
582700	586800	And it's more useful to draw distinctions between them than it is to simply abandon the term.
586900	588600	The first one is the classical fascist.
588700	594600	And hey, if you search for the phrase classical fascism on Wikipedia, you will get a unique page different from the one just titled fascism.
594700	596600	So there's already some knowledge of the distinction here.
596700	601300	I said earlier that fascism got its start in the political theories of French socialist and syndicalist, George Sorel.
601400	606200	In Sorel's book, Reflections on Violence, Sorel laid out the case for violence as a civilizing force.
606200	612600	Where an overly educated, overly civilized, overly pampered man was too domesticated to ever revolt against the bourgeois.
612700	618100	While a man who is in touch with his nature will know the regenerative effect that violent action has on the human soul.
618200	621600	To Sorel, violence was equated with life, creativity, and virtue.
621700	625400	While parliamentary democracy deadened the revolutionary spirit of the socialist.
625500	632400	He believed the state would use taxation and money printing as a new tool to siphon surplus value from the proletariat to the bourgeois.
632400	638400	And that voting was simply the means by which leftist reformist parties could skillfully manipulate the specter of evolution.
638500	643200	By which he meant keep the population docile enough with concessions that they don't overthrow the state.
643300	646700	And engage in the regenerative violence necessary for the socialist project.
646800	648500	Mussolini was an admirer of Sorel.
648600	650800	It's no secret that Mussolini was a socialist in his youth.
650900	655700	But many leftists today like to pretend that Mussolini wholly abandoned leftism in becoming a fascist.
655800	657000	This is far from the truth.
657100	661300	Mussolini's shift away from his socialist contemporaries was due to Sorel's influence.
661300	667300	He believed that the socialist of his era had been compromised, made docile in a sense, by engagement with democratic systems.
667400	671300	That socialists were happy to abandon the goal of revolution against the bourgeois state.
671400	678800	And settle for reforms within the current system meant to alleviate the working class's material conditions without actually granting them the ownership of the means of production.
678900	682500	At the same time, Mussolini operated within the shadow of the mutilated victory.
682600	683800	Here's the TLDR on that.
683900	688200	The Italians fought a war of independence to free themselves from the Austrian Empire in the 1860s.
688200	695300	After a cohesive Italian ethnic entity began to emerge to the point that the Italian people desired to be unified under King Victor Emmanuel II.
695400	697300	Rather than continue as a collection of city-states.
697400	706000	However, as is the case with almost all events like this, many ethnic Italian citizens and lands remained within the Austrian Empire even after formal Italian unification.
706100	711000	The Italians joined the Entente in the First World War and fought against Germany, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire.
711100	714200	Because the other European powers promised them a united Italy.
714300	721300	But American objections, of course it was the Americans, to the treaty between the Entente and Italy caused them to receive almost nothing for their efforts.
721400	724400	The Italians came to call this state of affairs the mutilated victory.
724500	731100	As the Italians had lost half a million soldiers in the war, incurred great economic cost to mobilize, and were already dealing with social turmoil.
731200	734400	From their point of view, World War I was a victory in name only.
734500	740400	Where more powerful and important nations would decide Italy's fate, regardless of the written text of any signed treaty.
740400	749400	Within this context, Italian socialists of the era developed the concept of the proletarian nation, which is a nation that is productive, moral, and inclined towards direct action.
749500	760400	Contrasted with a bourgeois nation or a plutocratic nation, which is a nation that is bureaucratic, financial, controls other nations with wealth and trade, and consumes the products of proletarian nations while also controlling their economy.
760500	765600	Enrico Corradini, who is both a socialist and an Italian nationalist, said in 1910,
765600	768500	We are the proletarian people in respect to the rest of the world.
768600	770500	Nationalism is our socialism.
770600	776500	This established, nationalism must be founded on the truth that Italy is morally and materially a proletarian nation.
776600	781500	We must start by recognizing the fact that there are proletarian nations as well as proletarian classes.
781600	787500	That is to say, there are nations whose living conditions are subject to the way of life of other nations, just as classes are.
787600	790500	Once this is realized, nationalism must insist firmly on this truth.
790500	797400	For the Italian socialists, revolution against the bourgeois was a nationalist revolution against an internationalist capitalist world order.
797500	800400	Other Italian thinkers came up with the concept of the corporative economy.
800500	806400	In the modern day, corporative and corporation make us think of large business, but that is not how the Italians used the term.
806500	812400	And Mussolini's famous quote about the merger of state and corporate power is often abused by people who don't know what they're talking about.
812400	819300	It is fascism. This isn't the name for this, and I think we can get some strong agreement that this is the model of fascism.
819400	826300	In fact, they call it a public-private partnership, so they don't have to call it fascism because people would probably be alarmed if they called it fascism directly.
826400	830300	Okay, so none of this has anything to do with fascism, and I don't know why the word isn't both.
830400	838300	Also, I think that this entire conversation portrays a huge misunderstanding of the efficiency of capital markets in the United States and across the world.
838400	841300	Can I break up for one second? How many of Cloud 12's books have you read?
841300	845200	Give me a definition of fascism that would be incorporated in this.
845300	855200	It's the fusion of public and private. It is the corporatism of the D.W.S. where he said that he brings a corporation into the state.
855300	860200	There's a fusion of corporate and state power, or in modern parlance, a public-private partnership.
860300	863200	Well, that's the case that we've been in a fascist state for a long time.
863300	867200	That means literally every single government and everything in the world is fascist.
867200	872100	This is not what fascism is. I guess it's a fun word to use if people on the left like to use this, and maybe people on the right are using it too.
872200	879100	Corporatism is an economic theory separate from capitalism and socialism, and is the main reason why fascists often refer to themselves as the third position.
879200	887100	The idea is, society will reach a peak of harmonious functioning when each of its divisions efficiently performs its functions, like organs in a body or cogs in a mechanism.
887200	893100	Though there may be small or large components, all need to be in place in order for the whole to function at its best.
893200	896100	Like capitalism, corporatism allows for profit and private enterprise.
896100	899000	Like socialism, corporatism collectively controls the economy.
899100	910000	Corporatist theory called for a series of councils, divided by industry, where representatives from the nationalized labor union and business owners who had been granted patronage by the state, would be directed by government officials in the setting of economic policy.
910100	916000	In many ways, the fascist corporative theory is similar to Anton Penacik's council communism.
916100	924000	Mussolini adopted these various theories and others into a wider, more complete political theory of fascism, with the help of the Italian philosopher, Giovanni Gentile.
924000	926900	Classical fascism is best described by Mussolini's most famous quote,
927000	935900	All within the state, a state of affairs where everything is political, there is no private, there is no personal, all things are a matter of public inquiry, and therefore within the state's jurisdiction.
936000	943900	At the same time, George Sorel described fascism as a merger of the national and the social, and was modest but proud of inspiring Mussolini's new step in the socialist project.
944000	949900	Many socialist thinkers of the era, not just Sorel, noticed that Marx's predictions of an inevitable revolution had failed to come to pass,
950900	955800	and they ultimately became enamored with Mussolini's fascism as the next logical step of progress beyond socialism.
955900	959800	After fascism's failure, Sorel threw his lot in with the Soviet Union until his death.
959900	966800	There were only two true classically fascist nations, Italy and Spain, though Portugal did it test the waters for a while.
966900	970800	That's right, Germany was not classically fascist, and Hitler was not a classical fascist.
970900	974800	Hitler was a neo-fascist, and the neo-fascists are the second group we've got to talk about.
979900	988800	You know how a lot of leftists online like to make the claim that Hitler wasn't a socialist, he killed all the socialists in the night of the long knives?
988900	993800	On June 30th, 1934, Hitler conducted a purge, where he killed a bunch of his political opponents.
993900	996800	One of the groups he targeted and wiped out were the Strasserites.
996900	1001800	Otto and Gregor Strasser, two German brothers, led the Strasserite faction of the Nazi party.
1001900	1004800	They were colloquially known as Left Nazis, or Left Fascists.
1004800	1011700	Strasserism called for a mass-action worker-based form of Nazism, where anti-Semitism was justified due to its anti-capitalist component.
1011800	1016700	Gregor Strasser and his supporters were killed on that night, while Otto had fled Germany a year prior.
1016800	1022700	So whenever a leftist leaps to the defense of the socialists that Hitler purged, feel free to remind them exactly who they're defending.
1022800	1027700	Also, as a quick aside, this sounds a lot like Trotsky's own purge by Stalin that I described a few videos back.
1027800	1033700	It's almost like socialism as an ideology naturally creates the environment for people who are only interested in power to appear.
1033700	1037600	Seize control, and purge those who are more ideologically devoted to socialism.
1037700	1041600	This is why they always say it wasn't real socialism, and it's also why it never will be.
1041700	1048600	The reason we're talking about the Strasserites, though, is because the Strasserites were more classically fascist, and the Hitlerites were neo-fascist.
1048700	1053600	Unlike the classical fascists, the neo-fascists don't have an ideological commitment to the idea of the corporative economy.
1053700	1058600	Germany played a bit more loose with the idea of private ownership, as long as you were a member of the Nazi party, anyway,
1058700	1061600	while Japan outright nationalized everything it could.
1061600	1067500	The classical fascists also had a conception of ethnic superiority, but this was ultimately based on culture, not race.
1067600	1072500	Fascist Italy contained both light-skinned Italians in the north, and dark-skinned Italians in the south.
1072600	1077500	Even Jews, one-third of Italy's Jewish population, joined the Italian fascist party.
1077600	1083500	For the classical fascists, at least in Italy, superiority was not based on race, but on identification with the Italian ethnicity and culture.
1083600	1089500	Meanwhile, the neo-fascists in Germany had a much more strict definition of who was Aryan or non-Aryan.
1089500	1096400	It wasn't simply a white person thing, because many people that we would consider white nowadays, like Slavs, for example, were not considered Aryan.
1096500	1100400	Their theories were based more directly in the supremacy of Aryan blood.
1100500	1103400	The neo-fascists also secularized the mutilated victory.
1103500	1107400	While the Italians felt they had been cheated out of their unification, and they were simply getting what they were owed,
1107500	1114400	Germany turned unification with all ethnic German peoples within Europe into its own virtue, independent of any signed treaty.
1114500	1119400	To them, bringing all Germans within Germany was simply the proper ordering of the world.
1119500	1127400	The neo-fascists also entangled race and spirituality and land in a way that hadn't quite been done before.
1127500	1132400	For the Germans, the claim of Aryan superiority stemmed from some rather wacky Nazi occult beliefs.
1132500	1136400	To them, the organized indigenous religions of Europe were an act of hindrance.
1136500	1142400	The classical fascists treated religion more pragmatically, simply as another organ of society that was to be brought under the control of the state.
1142500	1145400	Another difference between them was in their conception of anti-politics.
1145400	1149300	The neo-fascists took Sorelle's conception of regenerative violence and pushed it to the extreme,
1149400	1155300	believing that politics itself was a capitalist, and Jewish in the case of Germany, corruption of the human spirit.
1155400	1161300	In their view, because politics is the vehicle by which we non-violently solve our disputes, politics is a castrating force.
1161400	1166300	If politics serves to lengthen the distance between having a disagreement and the outbreak of violence,
1166400	1169300	the neo-fascist seeks to shorten that distance as much as possible.
1169400	1173300	Hitler used the phrase anti-politics to describe this desire,
1173300	1177200	but anti-politics has been a component of populist movements on both the left and the right.
1177300	1181200	Neo-fascism's rejection of democracy is a component of anti-politics,
1181300	1185200	while the classical fascist rejects democracy as a consequence of sublimating everything to the state.
1185300	1190200	In general, neo-fascism is classical fascism at its maximum, its most realized, its most brutal.
1190300	1194200	It is also a more pragmatic, less ideological form of fascism.
1194300	1198200	In contrast with Mussolini's more overt state worship with all within the state,
1198300	1201200	neo-fascism is best described by the famous words, blood and soil,
1201200	1206100	though that had been a German folk saying for many years, Hitler repeated it often as a justification for Nazism.
1206200	1211100	The classical fascists and the neo-fascists are more similar to each other than they are to the final group,
1211200	1214100	but nonetheless, there is a natural line of evolution we can examine.
1222200	1224100	The third group are the post-fascists.
1224200	1227100	These are the modern-day fascists, the ones that you are most likely to encounter nowadays.
1227100	1230000	Outwardly, these people seem quite different from the first two,
1230100	1233000	to the point that they often mask their intentions by appealing to this difference.
1233100	1236000	Hey, we're not members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party,
1236100	1239000	we don't believe in the Aryan master race, but they are connected in a few key ways,
1239100	1243000	and in order to explain how, I need to explain to you the concept of spontaneous order.
1243100	1247000	Spontaneous order is, well, exactly as it sounds.
1247100	1249000	It's when order generates on its own out of chaos.
1249100	1253000	Primarily an economic theory, used to describe how markets tend toward equilibrium,
1253100	1255000	but it does have uses outside of economics.
1255000	1257900	Spontaneous order describes the various types of social orders
1258000	1259900	that exist within human social networks
1260000	1262900	that are generated by the behavior of independent, rational, self-interested people
1263000	1265900	who are not intentionally trying to create a social order through planning.
1266000	1269900	Large swaths of anarchist and libertarian political theory relies on spontaneous order
1270000	1272900	with the belief that the state and its mechanisms are not necessary
1273000	1276900	because free people will naturally recreate all that they need in a decentralized manner.
1277000	1280900	For example, anarcho-capitalists believe that the state's market regulation isn't necessary
1281000	1282900	because free markets will naturally self-regulate.
1282900	1287800	Meanwhile, anarcho-communists and libertarian socialists believe that the state isn't necessary
1287900	1291800	because it's the state's mechanisms that create and uphold property and capitalism,
1291900	1293800	and without it, communalization of everything is inevitable.
1293900	1297800	They believe, in the absence of the state, that people will just naturally communalize everything.
1297900	1301800	So, the post-fascists believe, and this is going to sound a bit wild, so hold on to the edge of your seats,
1301900	1306800	the post-fascists believe in a form of fascism that comes about due to spontaneous order.
1306900	1310800	A libertarian fascism, or an anarcho-fascism, as weird as that sounds.
1310800	1313700	The idea is, the liberal capitalist bureaucratic state,
1313800	1316700	the thing that lengthens the distance between politics and violence,
1316800	1319700	that turns the common person into a tamed pet of the bourgeois.
1319800	1326700	If this institution is overthrown, people will, on their own, naturally trend towards the creation of the ideal fascist society.
1326800	1330700	But paradoxically, without a fascist state, no one forced corporative economy, no state worship,
1330800	1336700	no concern for cerulean socialism, instead, a series of stateless, decentralized communities
1336700	1340600	that are highly anti-democratic, and rigidly authoritarian, based along tribal lines.
1340700	1344600	That tribe can be a race, or an ethnicity, but it doesn't need to be.
1344700	1347600	It can also be a religion, or a nationality, or a political affiliation.
1347700	1351600	Whatever it is, though, the friend-enemy distinction is fervently observed.
1351700	1354600	In essence, we're talking about post-modern neo-tribalism.
1354700	1358600	This is why you see people who call themselves Christian nationalists, or Christian fascists,
1358700	1363600	or islamo-fascists, as they frame their movements as struggles for freedom to break away from the liberal state
1363600	1367500	and establish their own decentralized, separate, small communities.
1373600	1377500	These people generally don't have any sort of racial or ethnic superiority narrative either.
1377600	1383500	Where the Italians appealed to unity, and the Germans appealed to supremacy, the post-fascists reject both of these ideas.
1383600	1389500	For a post-fascist, the only difference between you and an opposing tribe is that you are your tribe, and they are theirs.
1389600	1391500	No further justification is needed to treat the other as an enemy.
1391500	1395400	No supremacy narrative, no past slight, the difference itself is enough.
1395500	1400400	Additionally, for the post-fascist, religion and spirituality has already been laid bare by the Enlightenment.
1400500	1404400	Nonetheless, the spiritual impulse is what drives people to take action.
1404500	1410400	Taking a page from both Evola and Hitler, the post-fascist believes that he can simply construct a new mythology out of thin air,
1410500	1415400	one that will serve to unify his community and provide the most social utility, regardless of truth or tradition.
1415400	1421300	If everything is all simultaneously fake and necessary, then why not just tell the most politically effective lies?
1421400	1426300	More so than the other forms of fascism, post-fascism is anti-ideological and extremely opportunistic.
1426400	1432300	Post-fascism is anti-democratic, but where the classical fascists rejected democracy as a side effect of state expansion
1432400	1438300	and the neo-fascists rejected it for ideological reasons, the post-fascists reject it as a failed experiment.
1438400	1442300	They blame all of the ills of modern society on the democratic project itself.
1442300	1446200	After all, if you wouldn't tolerate somebody else voting on what you should do in your private life,
1446300	1449200	why should you tolerate people outside your community voting on what goes on within it?
1449300	1452200	Post-fascism also has a thirst for violence.
1452300	1457200	Where the classical fascists leaned on Sorelle's conception of violence as a revitalizing revolutionary force,
1457300	1464200	and the neo-fascists conceived of anti-politics, of shortening the distance between disagreement and violence by subverting a liberal society,
1464300	1468200	post-fascists, like the libertarians and the libertarian socialists they're related to,
1468200	1473100	believe that politics itself is violence, that when you vote or otherwise engage in politics,
1473200	1476100	you are already committing violence against those you disagree with,
1476200	1479100	since the state will enforce your laws on them if they lose the vote.
1479200	1485100	So there's no difference between normal political engagement and actually, you know, political violence in the streets.
1485200	1492100	Though Mencius Moldbug rejects the term fascist to describe himself, he does so by specifically rejecting classical fascism.
1492200	1496100	Post-fascism fits his views quite well, as well as the views of the broader neo-reactionary movement,
1496100	1498000	and their writing bears that out.
1498100	1502000	And there are a number of figures on the online left, most comically Vosch, who also fit the bill.
1502100	1506000	The rejection of truth or principle in the pursuit of political advantage.
1506100	1511000	The rejection of any institution that does not generate victories for them, regardless of its legitimacy.
1511100	1516000	The desire to shorten the distance between disagreement and violence through a rejection of the very concept of compromise.
1516100	1521000	The belief in an internationalist capitalist world order using dark money to bring nations to heel.
1521100	1524000	And a tendency towards isolation and extreme purity testing.
1524000	1529900	The best way to describe post-fascism is, paradoxically, anti-liberty libertarian.
1538000	1543900	I have presented these three positions, classical fascist, neo-fascist, and post-fascist, for the most part, impassionately.
1544000	1545900	And without my own judgments attached.
1546000	1549900	Because I want you to hear the ideas for yourselves and make your own judgments on if they're good or bad.
1550000	1553900	The best way to do that, by the way, is to read that big stack of books for yourself too.
1554000	1554900	But I doubt you're going to do that.
1555000	1558900	And it would be unreasonable to expect it of you, considering just how fringe these people are, frankly.
1559000	1563900	A lot of people on the left say that fascists lie, or fascism is incoherent, or whatever else.
1564000	1564900	These people are stupid.
1565000	1567900	Fascism does contain some outward contradictions.
1568000	1571900	But careful examination shows these are just products of ignorance.
1572000	1577900	For example, the phrase reactionary modernism was coined to describe how the classical fascists and the neo-fascists
1578000	1580900	appeared to be simultaneously reactionary and revolutionary.
1580900	1585800	A concept that leftists and academia just couldn't wrap their head around until, like David Roberts said,
1585900	1588800	they stopped looking at fascism through a socialist lens.
1588900	1593800	Which was, really, politically motivated to erase the history of fascism blooming out of surreal socialism.
1593900	1597800	Mussolini and Hitler both explicitly rejected de Maistre's reactionary views,
1597900	1601800	and they had no desire to reconstitute the old institutions of medieval Europe.
1601900	1607800	They were searching for an alternative anti-liberal, anti-Marxist future, but it was still a futuristic vision in the end.
1607800	1610700	The paradoxes of post-fascism seem similarly inscrutable,
1610800	1616700	but they are laid bare once you understand the anti-democratic, anti-capitalist, and anti-freedom elements of that movement.
1616800	1623700	Just as today's radical socialists claim that you cannot be on the left without being a priori anti-capitalist,
1623800	1628700	today's radical fascists claim you cannot be on the right without being a priori anti-democratic.
1628800	1630700	As for what I believe, I'm against all of it.
1630800	1631700	All three fascists.
1631800	1632700	I'm against all the socialisms, too.
1632700	1639600	I have no problem in proudly proclaiming myself as an open liberal nationalist, maybe even a liberal supremacist at this point.
1639700	1644600	I value parliamentary democracy, but I also value a government that has appropriate anti-democratic elements.
1644700	1646600	I value private property, but I also value a social safety net.
1646700	1651600	Not as a right that's stupid, but as a privilege that wealthy nations should strive to afford.
1651700	1653600	I am distrustful of institutions, but I'm not a doomer.
1653700	1658600	I believe reform is possible, and that things are not nearly so bad that revolution is required.
1658600	1663500	There are people who used to associate with me who, for some reason, thought that I was dog-whistling, as they were,
1663600	1666500	when I said that I was a classical liberal or a centrist.
1666600	1668500	Those are the people that I would call idiots.
1668600	1675500	So, if you wanted to, you could make the argument that Nick Fuentes is post-fascist, if the discourse surrounding that word wasn't so toxic.
1675600	1676500	But destiny's correct.
1676600	1679500	The real question is, are those political positions any good?
1679600	1685500	Because every bad ideology, even the different flavors of socialism and fascism, have a few good positions that we would be wise to consider.
1685500	1690400	But it's my opinion, but for the overwhelming majority of them, the answer to that question is a resounding no.
1690500	1696400	Anyway, this has been a grueling video over a year in the making, a lot of that just reading boring stuff, so I'm going to go take a nap.
1696500	1698400	See you later, guys. I love you.
1700500	1705400	Oh, also, never bring up Umberto Eco's 14 points, unless you are a retard.
1705500	1708400	Do we really want me to read out Umberto Eco's 14 points?
1708500	1710400	No.
