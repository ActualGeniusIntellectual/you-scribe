1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
This is going to be one of those Dev Thinks videos.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:07,100
No goofy TikToks, no ridiculous headlines, no Twitter morons, at least for the most part.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,000
But we can start off with a bit of drama to get the ball rolling.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:29,600
["The

5
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,000
This has led to many, many long hours of discussion on the topic.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,200
Not all of it is necessarily worth watching, frankly.

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,800
No offense to either of these guys, but this is a lot of dead horse beating.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,200
For the sake of brevity, I will give you the clip that I think encapsulates the situation perfectly.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,000
So they'll be like this position, this position, this position, this position, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,800
So these are like the political positions that people have, and these are the things that I'm most interested in arguing with.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
This is what I want to fight about.

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,500
I want to fight about what you think about that, or what you think about this, or what you think about that.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,700
But people seem more concerned with like, can we group all of these together and call them this?

14
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,700
The problem is that this is one definition of Nazi.

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,300
It might include these traits.

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,200
Here's another definition of Nazi.

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,000
It might include like these traits.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,800
Here's another definition of Nazi.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,000
It might include like these traits.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,400
Here's another definition of Nazi.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,300
Might include, eh, we'll say these traits.

22
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,800
Maybe it encompasses something else here.

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,000
And people are fighting over like, what's your definition of Nazi?

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,700
And this is, this is the entire conversation of the sub.

25
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,300
Is it this?

26
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:30,900
Is it that?

27
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,200
Where?

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,600
Why would you call him this if he meets it?

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,900
If he, well, he did this, he said that, and he did this, and he's like, okay, hold on.

30
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't, I don't care about any of this.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,700
I just want to focus on these things.

32
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,600
This is what I talk about.

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,700
This is what I do.

34
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,800
I'm not interested in like giving you a particular political label or assigning you or ascribing to you some shit.

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,600
I don't really care because the problem is that when I use this definition, let's say that I define Nazi like this.

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:02,100
Okay, what you really want is you want this and this thing right here is your moral condemnation.

37
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,700
That's what you're looking for.

38
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,200
People are looking for this thing, which is bad Nazi bad.

39
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,500
This is what you want.

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:20,500
And the problem that people are running into, you might not realize this, but the problem that you're running into is that I'll talk about this and I'll talk about that and I'll talk about this and I'm at and you're like, no, no, no, no, no.

41
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,100
I need you to call him a Nazi.

42
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,100
And when you call him a Nazi, you're pretending that it's because we'll look destiny.

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,000
He's got this and that and that and that is, you know, see, you don't care about that though.

44
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,400
What you really want is you want this.

45
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,700
That's what you want.

46
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,100
You want the moral condemnation.

47
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,300
That's all you're concerned about.

48
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,000
And this thing here is the last thing in the world.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I care about I don't give a fuck about this thing because to include this thing already excludes anybody that would consider themselves any of these things.

50
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,000
They're necessarily not going to see themselves as evil.

51
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,200
They're obviously because they are they believe these things.

52
00:02:51,600 --> 00:03:01,400
But it's telling because we'll agree on this and we'll agree on that and we'll agree on this and we'll agree on that and then you'll get mad pretending that I'm not grouping these things together.

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
You're like, why would you just call him a thing?

54
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,500
It's like, well, who why do you care if I if we already agree on this shit?

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,900
Why do you care if I call him a thing or not?

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,600
And like because you're obfuscating because you're hiding what he really is.

57
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, what am I hiding?

58
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,200
If I agree on this tell me for Nick Fuentes and this would be a challenge to the subreddit.

59
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,800
What am I hiding about Nick Fuentes when I'm calling him this this or this or this or this and the answer is like, well, you won't call a Nazi.

60
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,000
Why do you care if I don't call him a Nazi if I identify with this person and the real reason is because you want this you want this here.

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,100
This is what I'm hiding by not calling him a Nazi.

62
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,700
I'm not including that he is evil or bad part.

63
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,600
That's the issue but that's just the part that I don't really care about.

64
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,500
I don't care about this.

65
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,800
I just don't really give a fuck about it.

66
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:46,800
This state of affairs is largely due to the overuse and misuse of terms like Nazi and fascist to the point that the words have been destroyed at least online.

67
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,800
They now only refer to whatever the speaker considers to be evil.

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:59,700
An example given repeatedly in these convos was when Vosch called President Bush or Justice Scalia fascists, even though they really don't have anything that makes them fascists except for Vosch's hatred.

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
How are Bush or Scalia a fascist?

70
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,500
So with Scalia, I would need to go back over the case rulings that he's given because I don't have a great memory for the judicial stuff.

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,300
I said that earlier.

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,800
I'd be happy to come back with a lot more arguments because this is stuff that I have to remember from podcasts that I've listened to and articles that I've read and conversations that I've had.

73
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,500
With Bush, I think the argument is a lot more direct and it's obviously something I remember a little bit more directly.

74
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:36,200
I think that Bush, the obvious ones, the straightforward ones are obviously the 2020 election and a nepotistic relationship between George Bush and a person already in power in order to undemocratically secure an election to which he otherwise probably didn't have a right.

75
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,500
I think that's definitely in line at least with the anti-democratic element of fascism, though it's nowhere near as overt as what Trump did, of course.

76
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,300
I'll get back to this in a second, but I've got to throw some books at you.

77
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,000
I won't go into super detail on any of them.

78
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,200
They're each deserving a video on their own that maybe I'll have time to give you one day.

79
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,300
I just want you to know what kind of rabbit hole I've gone down recently.

80
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:02,100
There was a pretty big event in this channel's history about a year ago that I know y'all know about which motivated me to read a stack of literature on fascism in an effort to understand the ideology.

81
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:10,300
The beginning point of this journey was me nagging Sargon to read Zeeb Sternhell's Neither Right Nor Left which he eventually did and made a book club video on with Callum.

82
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:18,000
The TLDR is, Sternhell was a historian and a Polish-born Jewish Holocaust survivor who, after the war, devoted himself to studying fascism.

83
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:25,200
Neither Right Nor Left is primarily a history book and it pins the origins of fascism not on Germany or Italy but instead on France,

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:35,700
specifically out of the ideas of the French socialist and syndicalist George Sorel who envisioned a pairing of nationalism with the revolutionary left as the task was not a revolt against the bourgeois of Marx's time,

85
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:43,300
the nationalist-oriented nobility and its elected leadership but instead against an internationalist capitalist bureaucratic class of globalist elites.

86
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,600
It was this Sorelian socialism that became the ideological basis for Mussolini's fascism.

87
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,300
That opened the floodgates for me and I began to look at multiple other positions on fascism.

88
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,400
The mass psychology of fascism is an analysis of fascism from a psychological and socialist perspective.

89
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:11,200
Wilhelm Reich, as a Freudian, traced the support for fascism among the working class back to sexual repression and advocated for a cultural shift towards total sexual openness and the complete dispensing with traditional sexual morality in order to combat fascist tendencies.

90
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:22,800
As a direct continuation of Reich's work, the Italian communist Mario Mielli penned the pamphlet Towards a Queer Communism where he advocated making love to children to desensitize them to sex as a form of anti-fascism.

91
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:30,200
Meanwhile, Hayek's The Road to Serfdom is a discussion of fascism from a libertarian point of view, focusing specifically on fascist economics.

92
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,500
His argument was that when the individual loses the ability to make economic choices for themselves as a result of central planning,

93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,600
what inevitably follows is a total loss of freedom, the creation of an oppressive society, the tyranny of a dictator, and the serfdom of the individual.

94
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:50,300
Hayek wrote in the context of an era where the popular view of fascism was that it was a capitalist reaction against socialism, something that Lenin popularized with this famous quote,

95
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,200
Fascism is capitalism in decay.

96
00:06:52,300 --> 00:07:00,300
Liberal writers would eventually take up positions closer to Hayek's than Reich's, all drawing comparisons between the socialism of the Soviet Union and the fascism of the Axis powers.

97
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,500
There's two books that serve as foils for each other.

98
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,300
The first is The Wages of Destruction by Adam Tooze, an open communist.

99
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,800
The second is Hitler's Beneficiaries by Goetz Ali, a German historian.

100
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:16,900
They both examine the domestic economic policies of Nazi Germany, with Ali saying that the socialism of national socialism was not simply propaganda,

101
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:23,500
but was actually reflected in the extreme amount of social mobility and wealth that the German working class gained from the Nazis in order to keep them complacent,

102
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,900
while Tooze naturally rejects Ali's conception of this as real socialism.

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,800
They actually entered into a fun back and forth for a while, editing new footnotes into subsequent editions of their books to respond to the claims of the other.

104
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,600
It's like shitposting in the fine print.

105
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,800
The most notable thing I've read recently was Fascist Interactions by Professor David Roberts of the University of Georgia.

106
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,700
Roberts asserts that fascist studies stagnated for decades because academics had stopped reading what the fascists themselves were writing.

107
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,400
Under the pretense that fascists always lie, so reading their political theory is useless.

108
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,700
Instead, academics were often encouraged by their peers to read other people's interpretations of fascism, generally socialist interpretations, and take it as gospel,

109
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:05,700
even to the point that social stigma began to develop in the academy if you wanted to look at fascism through a non-socialist lens or read fascist writers for yourselves.

110
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,900
According to Roberts, fascist studies only began to make breakthroughs again when this tendency was finally shook off,

111
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,700
and academics actually began listening to what fascists had to say about themselves.

112
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,700
After Roberts, I decided the next best thing was to follow his advice and read some of the fascists.

113
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Mein Kampf by Hitler, which even taking the morality of the subject matter out of it, is a horrible slog to get through.

114
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,200
Hitler was a terrible writer.

115
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,400
The Doctrine of Fascism by Mussolini and the similarly named Political Doctrine of Fascism by Alfredo Rocco

116
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,300
both functioned more as manifestos to be handed out and easily consumed, and less as full political science texts.

117
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:44,000
Revolt Against the Modern World by Julius Evola, who famously declared at his post-World War II trial that Italian fascism was not fascist enough for him,

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,500
and so he was a super-fascist.

119
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
Let me tell you, there's so many people out there.

120
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,900
While I've learned a lot having read just this much stuff about fascism, I think on some level destiny is correct.

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,900
Demanding that you use an emotionally charged term like fascist isn't about the ideas behind the word,

122
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,100
but the moral condemnation attached to it, and the word itself has become meaningless.

123
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,400
Which is a shame, because the ideas of all of these people need a way to properly describe them.

124
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,700
On Destiny's subreddit, this very long thread was posted, describing a highly academic definition of the word Nazi, and why Nick Fuentes doesn't fit the bill.

125
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,600
The issue with this is, despite it being accurate, it also means that, per this definition, there's pretty much no Nazis today.

126
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,200
Now, I'm okay with that. I can just let the Nazi label fade into history, personally.

127
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,800
But a lot of people can't. For them, it's too politically useful.

128
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,600
I've come to believe that there's actually three separate things that we refer to whenever we use the word Nazi or fascist.

129
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,800
And it's more useful to draw distinctions between them than it is to simply abandon the term.

130
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,600
The first one is the classical fascist.

131
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,600
And hey, if you search for the phrase classical fascism on Wikipedia, you will get a unique page different from the one just titled fascism.

132
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,600
So there's already some knowledge of the distinction here.

133
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,300
I said earlier that fascism got its start in the political theories of French socialist and syndicalist, George Sorel.

134
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,200
In Sorel's book, Reflections on Violence, Sorel laid out the case for violence as a civilizing force.

135
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:12,600
Where an overly educated, overly civilized, overly pampered man was too domesticated to ever revolt against the bourgeois.

136
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,100
While a man who is in touch with his nature will know the regenerative effect that violent action has on the human soul.

137
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,600
To Sorel, violence was equated with life, creativity, and virtue.

138
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,400
While parliamentary democracy deadened the revolutionary spirit of the socialist.

139
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:32,400
He believed the state would use taxation and money printing as a new tool to siphon surplus value from the proletariat to the bourgeois.

140
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,400
And that voting was simply the means by which leftist reformist parties could skillfully manipulate the specter of evolution.

141
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,200
By which he meant keep the population docile enough with concessions that they don't overthrow the state.

142
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,700
And engage in the regenerative violence necessary for the socialist project.

143
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,500
Mussolini was an admirer of Sorel.

144
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,800
It's no secret that Mussolini was a socialist in his youth.

145
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,700
But many leftists today like to pretend that Mussolini wholly abandoned leftism in becoming a fascist.

146
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,000
This is far from the truth.

147
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,300
Mussolini's shift away from his socialist contemporaries was due to Sorel's influence.

148
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,300
He believed that the socialist of his era had been compromised, made docile in a sense, by engagement with democratic systems.

149
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,300
That socialists were happy to abandon the goal of revolution against the bourgeois state.

150
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:18,800
And settle for reforms within the current system meant to alleviate the working class's material conditions without actually granting them the ownership of the means of production.

151
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,500
At the same time, Mussolini operated within the shadow of the mutilated victory.

152
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,800
Here's the TLDR on that.

153
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,200
The Italians fought a war of independence to free themselves from the Austrian Empire in the 1860s.

154
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:35,300
After a cohesive Italian ethnic entity began to emerge to the point that the Italian people desired to be unified under King Victor Emmanuel II.

155
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,300
Rather than continue as a collection of city-states.

156
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:46,000
However, as is the case with almost all events like this, many ethnic Italian citizens and lands remained within the Austrian Empire even after formal Italian unification.

157
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,000
The Italians joined the Entente in the First World War and fought against Germany, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire.

158
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,200
Because the other European powers promised them a united Italy.

159
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:01,300
But American objections, of course it was the Americans, to the treaty between the Entente and Italy caused them to receive almost nothing for their efforts.

160
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,400
The Italians came to call this state of affairs the mutilated victory.

161
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,100
As the Italians had lost half a million soldiers in the war, incurred great economic cost to mobilize, and were already dealing with social turmoil.

162
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,400
From their point of view, World War I was a victory in name only.

163
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,400
Where more powerful and important nations would decide Italy's fate, regardless of the written text of any signed treaty.

164
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Within this context, Italian socialists of the era developed the concept of the proletarian nation, which is a nation that is productive, moral, and inclined towards direct action.

165
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:40,400
Contrasted with a bourgeois nation or a plutocratic nation, which is a nation that is bureaucratic, financial, controls other nations with wealth and trade, and consumes the products of proletarian nations while also controlling their economy.

166
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,600
Enrico Corradini, who is both a socialist and an Italian nationalist, said in 1910,

167
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,500
We are the proletarian people in respect to the rest of the world.

168
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,500
Nationalism is our socialism.

169
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,500
This established, nationalism must be founded on the truth that Italy is morally and materially a proletarian nation.

170
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,500
We must start by recognizing the fact that there are proletarian nations as well as proletarian classes.

171
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,500
That is to say, there are nations whose living conditions are subject to the way of life of other nations, just as classes are.

172
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,500
Once this is realized, nationalism must insist firmly on this truth.

173
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,400
For the Italian socialists, revolution against the bourgeois was a nationalist revolution against an internationalist capitalist world order.

174
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,400
Other Italian thinkers came up with the concept of the corporative economy.

175
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,400
In the modern day, corporative and corporation make us think of large business, but that is not how the Italians used the term.

176
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,400
And Mussolini's famous quote about the merger of state and corporate power is often abused by people who don't know what they're talking about.

177
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:39,300
It is fascism. This isn't the name for this, and I think we can get some strong agreement that this is the model of fascism.

178
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:46,300
In fact, they call it a public-private partnership, so they don't have to call it fascism because people would probably be alarmed if they called it fascism directly.

179
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,300
Okay, so none of this has anything to do with fascism, and I don't know why the word isn't both.

180
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:58,300
Also, I think that this entire conversation portrays a huge misunderstanding of the efficiency of capital markets in the United States and across the world.

181
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,300
Can I break up for one second? How many of Cloud 12's books have you read?

182
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,200
Give me a definition of fascism that would be incorporated in this.

183
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:15,200
It's the fusion of public and private. It is the corporatism of the D.W.S. where he said that he brings a corporation into the state.

184
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,200
There's a fusion of corporate and state power, or in modern parlance, a public-private partnership.

185
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,200
Well, that's the case that we've been in a fascist state for a long time.

186
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,200
That means literally every single government and everything in the world is fascist.

187
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,100
This is not what fascism is. I guess it's a fun word to use if people on the left like to use this, and maybe people on the right are using it too.

188
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:39,100
Corporatism is an economic theory separate from capitalism and socialism, and is the main reason why fascists often refer to themselves as the third position.

189
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:47,100
The idea is, society will reach a peak of harmonious functioning when each of its divisions efficiently performs its functions, like organs in a body or cogs in a mechanism.

190
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,100
Though there may be small or large components, all need to be in place in order for the whole to function at its best.

191
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,100
Like capitalism, corporatism allows for profit and private enterprise.

192
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,000
Like socialism, corporatism collectively controls the economy.

193
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:10,000
Corporatist theory called for a series of councils, divided by industry, where representatives from the nationalized labor union and business owners who had been granted patronage by the state, would be directed by government officials in the setting of economic policy.

194
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:16,000
In many ways, the fascist corporative theory is similar to Anton Penacik's council communism.

195
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:24,000
Mussolini adopted these various theories and others into a wider, more complete political theory of fascism, with the help of the Italian philosopher, Giovanni Gentile.

196
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,900
Classical fascism is best described by Mussolini's most famous quote,

197
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,900
All within the state, a state of affairs where everything is political, there is no private, there is no personal, all things are a matter of public inquiry, and therefore within the state's jurisdiction.

198
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,900
At the same time, George Sorel described fascism as a merger of the national and the social, and was modest but proud of inspiring Mussolini's new step in the socialist project.

199
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,900
Many socialist thinkers of the era, not just Sorel, noticed that Marx's predictions of an inevitable revolution had failed to come to pass,

200
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:55,800
and they ultimately became enamored with Mussolini's fascism as the next logical step of progress beyond socialism.

201
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,800
After fascism's failure, Sorel threw his lot in with the Soviet Union until his death.

202
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:06,800
There were only two true classically fascist nations, Italy and Spain, though Portugal did it test the waters for a while.

203
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,800
That's right, Germany was not classically fascist, and Hitler was not a classical fascist.

204
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,800
Hitler was a neo-fascist, and the neo-fascists are the second group we've got to talk about.

205
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:28,800
You know how a lot of leftists online like to make the claim that Hitler wasn't a socialist, he killed all the socialists in the night of the long knives?

206
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,800
On June 30th, 1934, Hitler conducted a purge, where he killed a bunch of his political opponents.

207
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,800
One of the groups he targeted and wiped out were the Strasserites.

208
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,800
Otto and Gregor Strasser, two German brothers, led the Strasserite faction of the Nazi party.

209
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,800
They were colloquially known as Left Nazis, or Left Fascists.

210
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,700
Strasserism called for a mass-action worker-based form of Nazism, where anti-Semitism was justified due to its anti-capitalist component.

211
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,700
Gregor Strasser and his supporters were killed on that night, while Otto had fled Germany a year prior.

212
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,700
So whenever a leftist leaps to the defense of the socialists that Hitler purged, feel free to remind them exactly who they're defending.

213
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,700
Also, as a quick aside, this sounds a lot like Trotsky's own purge by Stalin that I described a few videos back.

214
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,700
It's almost like socialism as an ideology naturally creates the environment for people who are only interested in power to appear.

215
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,600
Seize control, and purge those who are more ideologically devoted to socialism.

216
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,600
This is why they always say it wasn't real socialism, and it's also why it never will be.

217
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:28,600
The reason we're talking about the Strasserites, though, is because the Strasserites were more classically fascist, and the Hitlerites were neo-fascist.

218
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,600
Unlike the classical fascists, the neo-fascists don't have an ideological commitment to the idea of the corporative economy.

219
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,600
Germany played a bit more loose with the idea of private ownership, as long as you were a member of the Nazi party, anyway,

220
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,600
while Japan outright nationalized everything it could.

221
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,500
The classical fascists also had a conception of ethnic superiority, but this was ultimately based on culture, not race.

222
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,500
Fascist Italy contained both light-skinned Italians in the north, and dark-skinned Italians in the south.

223
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,500
Even Jews, one-third of Italy's Jewish population, joined the Italian fascist party.

224
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,500
For the classical fascists, at least in Italy, superiority was not based on race, but on identification with the Italian ethnicity and culture.

225
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,500
Meanwhile, the neo-fascists in Germany had a much more strict definition of who was Aryan or non-Aryan.

226
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:16,400
It wasn't simply a white person thing, because many people that we would consider white nowadays, like Slavs, for example, were not considered Aryan.

227
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,400
Their theories were based more directly in the supremacy of Aryan blood.

228
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,400
The neo-fascists also secularized the mutilated victory.

229
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,400
While the Italians felt they had been cheated out of their unification, and they were simply getting what they were owed,

230
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:34,400
Germany turned unification with all ethnic German peoples within Europe into its own virtue, independent of any signed treaty.

231
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,400
To them, bringing all Germans within Germany was simply the proper ordering of the world.

232
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:47,400
The neo-fascists also entangled race and spirituality and land in a way that hadn't quite been done before.

233
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,400
For the Germans, the claim of Aryan superiority stemmed from some rather wacky Nazi occult beliefs.

234
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,400
To them, the organized indigenous religions of Europe were an act of hindrance.

235
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,400
The classical fascists treated religion more pragmatically, simply as another organ of society that was to be brought under the control of the state.

236
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,400
Another difference between them was in their conception of anti-politics.

237
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,300
The neo-fascists took Sorelle's conception of regenerative violence and pushed it to the extreme,

238
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,300
believing that politics itself was a capitalist, and Jewish in the case of Germany, corruption of the human spirit.

239
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,300
In their view, because politics is the vehicle by which we non-violently solve our disputes, politics is a castrating force.

240
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,300
If politics serves to lengthen the distance between having a disagreement and the outbreak of violence,

241
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,300
the neo-fascist seeks to shorten that distance as much as possible.

242
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,300
Hitler used the phrase anti-politics to describe this desire,

243
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,200
but anti-politics has been a component of populist movements on both the left and the right.

244
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,200
Neo-fascism's rejection of democracy is a component of anti-politics,

245
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,200
while the classical fascist rejects democracy as a consequence of sublimating everything to the state.

246
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,200
In general, neo-fascism is classical fascism at its maximum, its most realized, its most brutal.

247
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,200
It is also a more pragmatic, less ideological form of fascism.

248
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,200
In contrast with Mussolini's more overt state worship with all within the state,

249
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,200
neo-fascism is best described by the famous words, blood and soil,

250
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,100
though that had been a German folk saying for many years, Hitler repeated it often as a justification for Nazism.

251
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,100
The classical fascists and the neo-fascists are more similar to each other than they are to the final group,

252
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,100
but nonetheless, there is a natural line of evolution we can examine.

253
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,100
The third group are the post-fascists.

254
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,100
These are the modern-day fascists, the ones that you are most likely to encounter nowadays.

255
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,000
Outwardly, these people seem quite different from the first two,

256
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,000
to the point that they often mask their intentions by appealing to this difference.

257
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,000
Hey, we're not members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party,

258
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,000
we don't believe in the Aryan master race, but they are connected in a few key ways,

259
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,000
and in order to explain how, I need to explain to you the concept of spontaneous order.

260
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,000
Spontaneous order is, well, exactly as it sounds.

261
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,000
It's when order generates on its own out of chaos.

262
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,000
Primarily an economic theory, used to describe how markets tend toward equilibrium,

263
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,000
but it does have uses outside of economics.

264
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,900
Spontaneous order describes the various types of social orders

265
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,900
that exist within human social networks

266
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,900
that are generated by the behavior of independent, rational, self-interested people

267
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,900
who are not intentionally trying to create a social order through planning.

268
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,900
Large swaths of anarchist and libertarian political theory relies on spontaneous order

269
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,900
with the belief that the state and its mechanisms are not necessary

270
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,900
because free people will naturally recreate all that they need in a decentralized manner.

271
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,900
For example, anarcho-capitalists believe that the state's market regulation isn't necessary

272
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,900
because free markets will naturally self-regulate.

273
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,800
Meanwhile, anarcho-communists and libertarian socialists believe that the state isn't necessary

274
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,800
because it's the state's mechanisms that create and uphold property and capitalism,

275
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,800
and without it, communalization of everything is inevitable.

276
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,800
They believe, in the absence of the state, that people will just naturally communalize everything.

277
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,800
So, the post-fascists believe, and this is going to sound a bit wild, so hold on to the edge of your seats,

278
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,800
the post-fascists believe in a form of fascism that comes about due to spontaneous order.

279
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,800
A libertarian fascism, or an anarcho-fascism, as weird as that sounds.

280
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,700
The idea is, the liberal capitalist bureaucratic state,

281
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,700
the thing that lengthens the distance between politics and violence,

282
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,700
that turns the common person into a tamed pet of the bourgeois.

283
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:06,700
If this institution is overthrown, people will, on their own, naturally trend towards the creation of the ideal fascist society.

284
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,700
But paradoxically, without a fascist state, no one forced corporative economy, no state worship,

285
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,700
no concern for cerulean socialism, instead, a series of stateless, decentralized communities

286
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,600
that are highly anti-democratic, and rigidly authoritarian, based along tribal lines.

287
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,600
That tribe can be a race, or an ethnicity, but it doesn't need to be.

288
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,600
It can also be a religion, or a nationality, or a political affiliation.

289
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,600
Whatever it is, though, the friend-enemy distinction is fervently observed.

290
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,600
In essence, we're talking about post-modern neo-tribalism.

291
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,600
This is why you see people who call themselves Christian nationalists, or Christian fascists,

292
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,600
or islamo-fascists, as they frame their movements as struggles for freedom to break away from the liberal state

293
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,500
and establish their own decentralized, separate, small communities.

294
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,500
These people generally don't have any sort of racial or ethnic superiority narrative either.

295
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,500
Where the Italians appealed to unity, and the Germans appealed to supremacy, the post-fascists reject both of these ideas.

296
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,500
For a post-fascist, the only difference between you and an opposing tribe is that you are your tribe, and they are theirs.

297
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,500
No further justification is needed to treat the other as an enemy.

298
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,400
No supremacy narrative, no past slight, the difference itself is enough.

299
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,400
Additionally, for the post-fascist, religion and spirituality has already been laid bare by the Enlightenment.

300
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,400
Nonetheless, the spiritual impulse is what drives people to take action.

301
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,400
Taking a page from both Evola and Hitler, the post-fascist believes that he can simply construct a new mythology out of thin air,

302
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,400
one that will serve to unify his community and provide the most social utility, regardless of truth or tradition.

303
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,300
If everything is all simultaneously fake and necessary, then why not just tell the most politically effective lies?

304
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,300
More so than the other forms of fascism, post-fascism is anti-ideological and extremely opportunistic.

305
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,300
Post-fascism is anti-democratic, but where the classical fascists rejected democracy as a side effect of state expansion

306
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,300
and the neo-fascists rejected it for ideological reasons, the post-fascists reject it as a failed experiment.

307
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,300
They blame all of the ills of modern society on the democratic project itself.

308
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,200
After all, if you wouldn't tolerate somebody else voting on what you should do in your private life,

309
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,200
why should you tolerate people outside your community voting on what goes on within it?

310
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,200
Post-fascism also has a thirst for violence.

311
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:17,200
Where the classical fascists leaned on Sorelle's conception of violence as a revitalizing revolutionary force,

312
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:24,200
and the neo-fascists conceived of anti-politics, of shortening the distance between disagreement and violence by subverting a liberal society,

313
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,200
post-fascists, like the libertarians and the libertarian socialists they're related to,

314
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,100
believe that politics itself is violence, that when you vote or otherwise engage in politics,

315
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,100
you are already committing violence against those you disagree with,

316
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,100
since the state will enforce your laws on them if they lose the vote.

317
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,100
So there's no difference between normal political engagement and actually, you know, political violence in the streets.

318
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:52,100
Though Mencius Moldbug rejects the term fascist to describe himself, he does so by specifically rejecting classical fascism.

319
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,100
Post-fascism fits his views quite well, as well as the views of the broader neo-reactionary movement,

320
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,000
and their writing bears that out.

321
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:02,000
And there are a number of figures on the online left, most comically Vosch, who also fit the bill.

322
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,000
The rejection of truth or principle in the pursuit of political advantage.

323
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:11,000
The rejection of any institution that does not generate victories for them, regardless of its legitimacy.

324
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:16,000
The desire to shorten the distance between disagreement and violence through a rejection of the very concept of compromise.

325
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,000
The belief in an internationalist capitalist world order using dark money to bring nations to heel.

326
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,000
And a tendency towards isolation and extreme purity testing.

327
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,900
The best way to describe post-fascism is, paradoxically, anti-liberty libertarian.

328
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,900
I have presented these three positions, classical fascist, neo-fascist, and post-fascist, for the most part, impassionately.

329
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,900
And without my own judgments attached.

330
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,900
Because I want you to hear the ideas for yourselves and make your own judgments on if they're good or bad.

331
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,900
The best way to do that, by the way, is to read that big stack of books for yourself too.

332
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,900
But I doubt you're going to do that.

333
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,900
And it would be unreasonable to expect it of you, considering just how fringe these people are, frankly.

334
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,900
A lot of people on the left say that fascists lie, or fascism is incoherent, or whatever else.

335
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,900
These people are stupid.

336
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,900
Fascism does contain some outward contradictions.

337
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,900
But careful examination shows these are just products of ignorance.

338
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,900
For example, the phrase reactionary modernism was coined to describe how the classical fascists and the neo-fascists

339
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,900
appeared to be simultaneously reactionary and revolutionary.

340
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,800
A concept that leftists and academia just couldn't wrap their head around until, like David Roberts said,

341
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,800
they stopped looking at fascism through a socialist lens.

342
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,800
Which was, really, politically motivated to erase the history of fascism blooming out of surreal socialism.

343
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,800
Mussolini and Hitler both explicitly rejected de Maistre's reactionary views,

344
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,800
and they had no desire to reconstitute the old institutions of medieval Europe.

345
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:47,800
They were searching for an alternative anti-liberal, anti-Marxist future, but it was still a futuristic vision in the end.

346
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,700
The paradoxes of post-fascism seem similarly inscrutable,

347
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,700
but they are laid bare once you understand the anti-democratic, anti-capitalist, and anti-freedom elements of that movement.

348
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:03,700
Just as today's radical socialists claim that you cannot be on the left without being a priori anti-capitalist,

349
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,700
today's radical fascists claim you cannot be on the right without being a priori anti-democratic.

350
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,700
As for what I believe, I'm against all of it.

351
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,700
All three fascists.

352
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,700
I'm against all the socialisms, too.

353
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:19,600
I have no problem in proudly proclaiming myself as an open liberal nationalist, maybe even a liberal supremacist at this point.

354
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,600
I value parliamentary democracy, but I also value a government that has appropriate anti-democratic elements.

355
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,600
I value private property, but I also value a social safety net.

356
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,600
Not as a right that's stupid, but as a privilege that wealthy nations should strive to afford.

357
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,600
I am distrustful of institutions, but I'm not a doomer.

358
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,600
I believe reform is possible, and that things are not nearly so bad that revolution is required.

359
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,500
There are people who used to associate with me who, for some reason, thought that I was dog-whistling, as they were,

360
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,500
when I said that I was a classical liberal or a centrist.

361
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,500
Those are the people that I would call idiots.

362
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:55,500
So, if you wanted to, you could make the argument that Nick Fuentes is post-fascist, if the discourse surrounding that word wasn't so toxic.

363
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,500
But destiny's correct.

364
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,500
The real question is, are those political positions any good?

365
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,500
Because every bad ideology, even the different flavors of socialism and fascism, have a few good positions that we would be wise to consider.

366
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,400
But it's my opinion, but for the overwhelming majority of them, the answer to that question is a resounding no.

367
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,400
Anyway, this has been a grueling video over a year in the making, a lot of that just reading boring stuff, so I'm going to go take a nap.

368
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,400
See you later, guys. I love you.

369
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,400
Oh, also, never bring up Umberto Eco's 14 points, unless you are a retard.

370
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,400
Do we really want me to read out Umberto Eco's 14 points?

371
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,400
No.
