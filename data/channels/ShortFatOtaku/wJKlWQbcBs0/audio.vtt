00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
It's TikTok Tuesday time once again, guys. I'm getting some new channel artwork made.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.880
You know, the background that you currently see with the big fat dev and you just holding

00:08.880 --> 00:13.520
the phone and looking at a computer with a big smile. I'm getting a new one made. But I think

00:13.520 --> 00:18.400
I'll keep this one for the TikTok Tuesdays because it kind of matches and the new one

00:18.400 --> 00:22.000
will be for my other videos. That's the plan anyway. Let's see how it goes.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.240
Let's watch the TikToks you guys have sent in this time.

00:25.280 --> 00:29.120
Bro, this is fucking crazy man. I'm at the fucking grocery store with my daughter, bro.

00:30.080 --> 00:36.560
And we just look nigga in this beard, dude. And my son weirdo ass. They got motherfucking steaks.

00:36.560 --> 00:43.040
They got fucking steaks locked up. You see this shit? They got steaks locked up. Oh my God.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.040
Those are the alarms. Yeah. What the? Come on, man. Stop stealing people. Yep. That's just how

00:51.040 --> 00:54.560
it is. When everyone's stealing stuff, this is what's going to happen. Either the store is going

00:54.560 --> 00:58.960
to close or everything's going to be locked up. If you're living in one of these low trust areas,

00:58.960 --> 01:02.800
you already know what I'm talking about. It's fucking ridiculous. This one says volume up.

01:02.800 --> 01:06.800
Should I turn the volume up? Here. I'll turn the volume up just for this one video.

01:09.280 --> 01:09.920
Oh my God.

01:13.840 --> 01:22.880
How did you like glue your hair down, lady? Yeah, it's called ballroom hair.

01:23.760 --> 01:27.920
So I guess it's all held in place by some sort of some sort of gorilla glue.

01:28.960 --> 01:36.560
Oh, why would you do this to yourself?

01:44.880 --> 01:51.760
Ah, just cut it all off. It's done lady.

01:51.760 --> 02:01.120
Oh my God. It's like a shell over her head. Well, what did you expect would happen? I swear

02:01.120 --> 02:04.640
to God, guys, you're just sending it. You're not even sending me tech talks that I can actually

02:04.640 --> 02:09.360
comment on or make a point or like a, like political tech talks. You're sending me like

02:09.360 --> 02:17.440
nonsense now, like people being retards. Show me some fucking respect. Did you ever consider

02:17.440 --> 02:22.000
setting up somewhere for us to actually school board fight guys. So we're doing it ourselves.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.640
Who added in the sound of that?

02:33.760 --> 02:37.120
Oh my God. We will identify as a fucking problem.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.320
The same goes for you.

02:40.320 --> 02:44.960
Why, why, why can't you allow both sides of the issue?

02:51.280 --> 02:56.560
So what it seems like is as if you want free speech, as long as it benefits you,

02:56.560 --> 03:01.600
as long as you get what you want. Yep. That's how they operate, dude. That's how it is. You

03:01.600 --> 03:06.320
got to figure it out. So it looked like there was a bunch of trans people coming in and disrupting

03:06.320 --> 03:09.600
some sort of school board meeting or some kind of meeting. Something was going on probably over

03:09.600 --> 03:14.720
like the trans kids thing, which is all the rage right now. Hold on. Let's watch it a bit though.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.760
This person here is speaking and that was like a very feminine sounding voice.

03:26.400 --> 03:32.240
You know, is this person actually trans or are they like a she, they non-binary therefore trans,

03:32.240 --> 03:36.160
even though they're not transitioning in on hormones. Like a lot of the people here seem

03:36.160 --> 03:41.280
like that. They seem like she, theys or he, theys. You know what I mean? Now who knows?

03:41.280 --> 03:46.080
I could be wrong. My transdar is like somewhat accurate, but it's not, you know, it's not perfect.

03:46.080 --> 03:53.840
So who knows? Like this person here seems more like a gender goblin or something. You know,

03:53.840 --> 03:58.880
someone who's like non-passing, but that initial speaker, that was someone who was seen definitely

03:58.880 --> 04:04.560
like a she, they, who just is like a masculine woman kind of tomboyish, but not really trans,

04:04.560 --> 04:07.040
but in 2023, she can call herself trans, you know?

04:07.040 --> 04:09.200
My goal is not to pass.

04:09.200 --> 04:09.760
What?

04:09.760 --> 04:14.480
My goal is to present in a way that makes other people go, okay, this person probably wants to

04:14.480 --> 04:19.360
be called she, her, not to make them think that I'm a cisgender woman. I don't mind people knowing

04:19.360 --> 04:23.520
I'm trans. In fact, in many cases, I want them to know that I'm trans. I want them to know that a

04:23.520 --> 04:29.520
trans person can take up space in the same space they are, especially as someone in STEM. I deserve

04:29.520 --> 04:35.040
to be here and I need younger trans people to see that. I think it'd be a better world for trans

04:35.040 --> 04:40.160
and non-binary people if nobody assumed anyone's gender or even their pronouns for that matter.

04:40.160 --> 04:45.120
What's the difference between you and a cross-dresser then? Because the whole point

04:45.120 --> 04:48.560
of cross-dresses is that like, yeah, they're cross-dressing, but you can kind of tell,

04:48.560 --> 04:53.360
right? You look at like a passing trans woman and a cross-dresser are not the same thing.

04:53.360 --> 04:57.680
Cross-dresser is supposed to be like, yep, got it. Man in a dress. They're playing with gender

04:57.680 --> 05:03.120
in a weird way. I understand where the trans woman, the point is to stealth. This person's

05:03.120 --> 05:09.840
like, no, I want to be clocked. I want people to notice that I'm actually a dude. What the,

05:09.840 --> 05:13.840
why? You know what? I was so stunned. I missed the end of the, of the video. Let me just play it

05:13.840 --> 05:18.000
again real quick. I want them to know that a trans person can take up space in the same space they

05:18.000 --> 05:23.840
are, especially as someone in STEM. Isn't that part of the joke is that there's tons of trans

05:23.840 --> 05:28.160
people in STEM? Like they're vastly overrepresented in STEM. I think it'd be a

05:28.160 --> 05:31.920
better world for trans and non-binary people if nobody assumed anyone's gender,

05:32.560 --> 05:37.680
or even their pronouns for that matter. Why? Assuming people's gender is kind of a fundamental

05:37.680 --> 05:41.920
part of being human. The main reason for that is reproduction, right? Like you have a guy,

05:41.920 --> 05:45.440
looks like a guy. You have a girl, looks like a girl. They see each other. They're attracted

05:45.440 --> 05:50.000
to each other. They assume that they have genitals that are compatible for reproduction. If it turns

05:50.000 --> 05:53.280
out that one of them doesn't, well then they feel like they've been betrayed because that's

05:53.280 --> 05:58.320
a reasonable assumption to make. The world is actually better that we assume gender. Things

05:58.320 --> 06:02.560
are more functional that way. Now there's always going to be outliers where that assumption doesn't

06:02.560 --> 06:10.080
apply, but we should not tailor the entirety of society for the outliers. I am not, sir. Oh God.

06:12.880 --> 06:18.560
Do you want to say that to the camera? Hundreds and hundreds of people watching you. Well,

06:18.560 --> 06:24.960
this person has an audience, eh? No, go ahead. You just called me a man. Don't be a coward.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.680
Don't be a coward. Okay, dude, use some voice training or something. Jesus.

06:29.680 --> 06:34.800
Say what you got to say to me. Oh, you don't want to call me a man. Is that a Che Guevara

06:34.800 --> 06:38.240
shirt in the background? Yes, it is. What do you got to say? What do you got to say? What do you

06:38.240 --> 06:45.840
got to say? What do you got to say? Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. I did not know this man was trans. This

06:46.640 --> 06:53.440
what do you go by? Does it matter? It does because I'm asking you. This guy sounds like a troll.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.360
There's a lot of people watching. The real question is, it doesn't matter if you're

06:57.360 --> 07:00.720
transgender or not. Are you with that? Are you with the, are you with the people that

07:00.720 --> 07:05.920
march and be like, we're coming for your kids. That's where it's bad. Yep. That's when he gets

07:06.000 --> 07:14.160
this guy. Yeah, he's got it. What's your name? Me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What's your name?

07:15.920 --> 07:20.320
You certainly don't. What's your name? JJ. And is your thing a cult?

07:25.520 --> 07:28.160
Oh my God. This is fucking hilarious.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.520
Wait, the staff. These are just random. Why you didn't step in?

07:34.000 --> 07:39.200
They're just random passerbys, dude. You're standing and watching. They called me a pedophile.

07:39.200 --> 07:58.880
Wait, no, they didn't call you. Oh my God. Listen, I don't know about you. Like a lot of things went

07:58.880 --> 08:02.400
crazy in that, especially when she was like, they called me a pedophile. No, they didn't.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.520
All right. But here, if someone's like, do you want to say that to the camera? I'd be just be

08:05.520 --> 08:12.320
like, yes, get your head. I I've been waiting for months and years of my life to have a situation

08:12.320 --> 08:17.280
like this happened to me to unleash the maximum troll effect. And have you planned how to gain

08:17.280 --> 08:22.560
my concern? For I would rather gouge out my eyes than permit someone who speaks so disrespectfully

08:22.560 --> 08:27.280
of women within 50 feet of me. Hold on. I got to watch that one again too, because I don't know

08:27.280 --> 08:35.200
what's going on. Hold on. Okay. Hold on. Okay. Tonight's tug sorted. I have so many questions.

08:35.200 --> 08:39.440
What does this mean? And have you planned how to gain my consent? For I would rather

08:39.440 --> 08:44.800
gouge out my eyes than permit someone who speaks so disrespectfully of women within 50 feet of me.

08:44.800 --> 08:49.360
Okay. Where's the JonTron thing. I have several questions. You know what I'm talking about? Okay.

08:49.360 --> 08:57.680
Okay. Firstly tonight's tug sorted. Question one, why is this your tug? Why this, this person,

08:57.680 --> 09:01.440
maybe you just like really fat chicks. I don't know, but like, this isn't going to be most

09:01.440 --> 09:09.920
people's tug for tonight. Okay. Secondly, why is she dressed up as an elf and why is she replying

09:09.920 --> 09:17.040
in the character of an elf? I, I don't know. Is this, have we stumbled onto like a LARPing corner

09:17.040 --> 09:23.440
of TikTok where they just role play as their character in their replies? I guess. Question

09:24.560 --> 09:30.160
three. Listen to the video again. And have you planned how to gain my consent? Okay. So,

09:30.160 --> 09:37.680
Oh my God. That was quite the cross-eyed stare to start the video on. Okay. So she immediately says

09:38.320 --> 09:46.240
that you need her consent to masturbate to her. Now is it, are we, are we going to go down like

09:46.240 --> 09:51.680
the whole, this is masturbation rape. Like it's masturbation sexual assault. If you jack off to

09:51.680 --> 09:55.440
another girl who like, who actually exists in real life, you don't tell her like you just fantasize

09:55.440 --> 10:00.240
about her in your own head. That's a form of sexual assault or a form of rape. I've heard

10:00.240 --> 10:04.720
some weird progressive say that like, it's not necessarily that common in lefty spaces,

10:04.720 --> 10:09.200
but I've definitely heard some like rad femmes say that, right. That if you masturbate to someone

10:09.200 --> 10:13.520
who exists without their permission, you're sexually assaulting them like psychically or

10:13.520 --> 10:18.720
something. And I guess that's her logic because this person says tonight's tug sorted and she

10:18.720 --> 10:22.240
goes, well, you need my consent for that bucko. Like, what are you going to do? Are you going

10:22.240 --> 10:26.560
to call up the precogs and have them arrest this guy for psychic crimes or something?

10:26.560 --> 10:30.160
Okay. I think, I think I'm done for today. Thanks very much. Right after this goes up,

10:30.160 --> 10:34.560
I'll be streaming. So make sure that you drop in and say hello. I'll be playing some more

10:34.560 --> 10:39.280
Starfield because it's a great game. Have a good one, everyone. I love you.
