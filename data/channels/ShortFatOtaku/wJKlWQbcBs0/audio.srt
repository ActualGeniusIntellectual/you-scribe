00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
It's TikTok Tuesday time once again, guys. I'm getting some new channel artwork made.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,880
You know, the background that you currently see with the big fat dev and you just holding

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,520
the phone and looking at a computer with a big smile. I'm getting a new one made. But I think

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,400
I'll keep this one for the TikTok Tuesdays because it kind of matches and the new one

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,000
will be for my other videos. That's the plan anyway. Let's see how it goes.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,240
Let's watch the TikToks you guys have sent in this time.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,120
Bro, this is fucking crazy man. I'm at the fucking grocery store with my daughter, bro.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,560
And we just look nigga in this beard, dude. And my son weirdo ass. They got motherfucking steaks.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:43,040
They got fucking steaks locked up. You see this shit? They got steaks locked up. Oh my God.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,040
Those are the alarms. Yeah. What the? Come on, man. Stop stealing people. Yep. That's just how

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,560
it is. When everyone's stealing stuff, this is what's going to happen. Either the store is going

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,960
to close or everything's going to be locked up. If you're living in one of these low trust areas,

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,800
you already know what I'm talking about. It's fucking ridiculous. This one says volume up.

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Should I turn the volume up? Here. I'll turn the volume up just for this one video.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,920
Oh my God.

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:22,880
How did you like glue your hair down, lady? Yeah, it's called ballroom hair.

17
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,920
So I guess it's all held in place by some sort of some sort of gorilla glue.

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,560
Oh, why would you do this to yourself?

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,760
Ah, just cut it all off. It's done lady.

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:01,120
Oh my God. It's like a shell over her head. Well, what did you expect would happen? I swear

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,640
to God, guys, you're just sending it. You're not even sending me tech talks that I can actually

22
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,360
comment on or make a point or like a, like political tech talks. You're sending me like

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,440
nonsense now, like people being retards. Show me some fucking respect. Did you ever consider

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,000
setting up somewhere for us to actually school board fight guys. So we're doing it ourselves.

25
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,640
Who added in the sound of that?

26
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,120
Oh my God. We will identify as a fucking problem.

27
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,320
The same goes for you.

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,960
Why, why, why can't you allow both sides of the issue?

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,560
So what it seems like is as if you want free speech, as long as it benefits you,

30
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,600
as long as you get what you want. Yep. That's how they operate, dude. That's how it is. You

31
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,320
got to figure it out. So it looked like there was a bunch of trans people coming in and disrupting

32
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,600
some sort of school board meeting or some kind of meeting. Something was going on probably over

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,720
like the trans kids thing, which is all the rage right now. Hold on. Let's watch it a bit though.

34
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,760
This person here is speaking and that was like a very feminine sounding voice.

35
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,240
You know, is this person actually trans or are they like a she, they non-binary therefore trans,

36
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,160
even though they're not transitioning in on hormones. Like a lot of the people here seem

37
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,280
like that. They seem like she, theys or he, theys. You know what I mean? Now who knows?

38
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,080
I could be wrong. My transdar is like somewhat accurate, but it's not, you know, it's not perfect.

39
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,840
So who knows? Like this person here seems more like a gender goblin or something. You know,

40
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,880
someone who's like non-passing, but that initial speaker, that was someone who was seen definitely

41
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,560
like a she, they, who just is like a masculine woman kind of tomboyish, but not really trans,

42
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,040
but in 2023, she can call herself trans, you know?

43
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
My goal is not to pass.

44
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,760
What?

45
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,480
My goal is to present in a way that makes other people go, okay, this person probably wants to

46
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,360
be called she, her, not to make them think that I'm a cisgender woman. I don't mind people knowing

47
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,520
I'm trans. In fact, in many cases, I want them to know that I'm trans. I want them to know that a

48
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,520
trans person can take up space in the same space they are, especially as someone in STEM. I deserve

49
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,040
to be here and I need younger trans people to see that. I think it'd be a better world for trans

50
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,160
and non-binary people if nobody assumed anyone's gender or even their pronouns for that matter.

51
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,120
What's the difference between you and a cross-dresser then? Because the whole point

52
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
of cross-dresses is that like, yeah, they're cross-dressing, but you can kind of tell,

53
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,360
right? You look at like a passing trans woman and a cross-dresser are not the same thing.

54
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,680
Cross-dresser is supposed to be like, yep, got it. Man in a dress. They're playing with gender

55
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,120
in a weird way. I understand where the trans woman, the point is to stealth. This person's

56
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,840
like, no, I want to be clocked. I want people to notice that I'm actually a dude. What the,

57
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,840
why? You know what? I was so stunned. I missed the end of the, of the video. Let me just play it

58
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,000
again real quick. I want them to know that a trans person can take up space in the same space they

59
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,840
are, especially as someone in STEM. Isn't that part of the joke is that there's tons of trans

60
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,160
people in STEM? Like they're vastly overrepresented in STEM. I think it'd be a

61
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,920
better world for trans and non-binary people if nobody assumed anyone's gender,

62
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,680
or even their pronouns for that matter. Why? Assuming people's gender is kind of a fundamental

63
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,920
part of being human. The main reason for that is reproduction, right? Like you have a guy,

64
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,440
looks like a guy. You have a girl, looks like a girl. They see each other. They're attracted

65
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,000
to each other. They assume that they have genitals that are compatible for reproduction. If it turns

66
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,280
out that one of them doesn't, well then they feel like they've been betrayed because that's

67
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,320
a reasonable assumption to make. The world is actually better that we assume gender. Things

68
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,560
are more functional that way. Now there's always going to be outliers where that assumption doesn't

69
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:10,080
apply, but we should not tailor the entirety of society for the outliers. I am not, sir. Oh God.

70
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,560
Do you want to say that to the camera? Hundreds and hundreds of people watching you. Well,

71
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,960
this person has an audience, eh? No, go ahead. You just called me a man. Don't be a coward.

72
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,680
Don't be a coward. Okay, dude, use some voice training or something. Jesus.

73
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,800
Say what you got to say to me. Oh, you don't want to call me a man. Is that a Che Guevara

74
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,240
shirt in the background? Yes, it is. What do you got to say? What do you got to say? What do you

75
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,840
got to say? What do you got to say? Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. I did not know this man was trans. This

76
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,440
what do you go by? Does it matter? It does because I'm asking you. This guy sounds like a troll.

77
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,360
There's a lot of people watching. The real question is, it doesn't matter if you're

78
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,720
transgender or not. Are you with that? Are you with the, are you with the people that

79
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,920
march and be like, we're coming for your kids. That's where it's bad. Yep. That's when he gets

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,160
this guy. Yeah, he's got it. What's your name? Me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What's your name?

81
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,320
You certainly don't. What's your name? JJ. And is your thing a cult?

82
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,160
Oh my God. This is fucking hilarious.

83
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,520
Wait, the staff. These are just random. Why you didn't step in?

84
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,200
They're just random passerbys, dude. You're standing and watching. They called me a pedophile.

85
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:58,880
Wait, no, they didn't call you. Oh my God. Listen, I don't know about you. Like a lot of things went

86
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,400
crazy in that, especially when she was like, they called me a pedophile. No, they didn't.

87
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,520
All right. But here, if someone's like, do you want to say that to the camera? I'd be just be

88
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,320
like, yes, get your head. I I've been waiting for months and years of my life to have a situation

89
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,280
like this happened to me to unleash the maximum troll effect. And have you planned how to gain

90
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,560
my concern? For I would rather gouge out my eyes than permit someone who speaks so disrespectfully

91
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,280
of women within 50 feet of me. Hold on. I got to watch that one again too, because I don't know

92
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:35,200
what's going on. Hold on. Okay. Hold on. Okay. Tonight's tug sorted. I have so many questions.

93
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,440
What does this mean? And have you planned how to gain my consent? For I would rather

94
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,800
gouge out my eyes than permit someone who speaks so disrespectfully of women within 50 feet of me.

95
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,360
Okay. Where's the JonTron thing. I have several questions. You know what I'm talking about? Okay.

96
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:57,680
Okay. Firstly tonight's tug sorted. Question one, why is this your tug? Why this, this person,

97
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,440
maybe you just like really fat chicks. I don't know, but like, this isn't going to be most

98
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,920
people's tug for tonight. Okay. Secondly, why is she dressed up as an elf and why is she replying

99
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:17,040
in the character of an elf? I, I don't know. Is this, have we stumbled onto like a LARPing corner

100
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,440
of TikTok where they just role play as their character in their replies? I guess. Question

101
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,160
three. Listen to the video again. And have you planned how to gain my consent? Okay. So,

102
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,680
Oh my God. That was quite the cross-eyed stare to start the video on. Okay. So she immediately says

103
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:46,240
that you need her consent to masturbate to her. Now is it, are we, are we going to go down like

104
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,680
the whole, this is masturbation rape. Like it's masturbation sexual assault. If you jack off to

105
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,440
another girl who like, who actually exists in real life, you don't tell her like you just fantasize

106
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,240
about her in your own head. That's a form of sexual assault or a form of rape. I've heard

107
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,720
some weird progressive say that like, it's not necessarily that common in lefty spaces,

108
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,200
but I've definitely heard some like rad femmes say that, right. That if you masturbate to someone

109
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,520
who exists without their permission, you're sexually assaulting them like psychically or

110
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,720
something. And I guess that's her logic because this person says tonight's tug sorted and she

111
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,240
goes, well, you need my consent for that bucko. Like, what are you going to do? Are you going

112
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,560
to call up the precogs and have them arrest this guy for psychic crimes or something?

113
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,160
Okay. I think, I think I'm done for today. Thanks very much. Right after this goes up,

114
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,560
I'll be streaming. So make sure that you drop in and say hello. I'll be playing some more

115
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,280
Starfield because it's a great game. Have a good one, everyone. I love you.
