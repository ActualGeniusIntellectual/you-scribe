0	5200	It's TikTok Tuesday time once again, guys. I'm getting some new channel artwork made.
5200	8880	You know, the background that you currently see with the big fat dev and you just holding
8880	13520	the phone and looking at a computer with a big smile. I'm getting a new one made. But I think
13520	18400	I'll keep this one for the TikTok Tuesdays because it kind of matches and the new one
18400	22000	will be for my other videos. That's the plan anyway. Let's see how it goes.
22000	24240	Let's watch the TikToks you guys have sent in this time.
25280	29120	Bro, this is fucking crazy man. I'm at the fucking grocery store with my daughter, bro.
30080	36560	And we just look nigga in this beard, dude. And my son weirdo ass. They got motherfucking steaks.
36560	43040	They got fucking steaks locked up. You see this shit? They got steaks locked up. Oh my God.
44000	51040	Those are the alarms. Yeah. What the? Come on, man. Stop stealing people. Yep. That's just how
51040	54560	it is. When everyone's stealing stuff, this is what's going to happen. Either the store is going
54560	58960	to close or everything's going to be locked up. If you're living in one of these low trust areas,
58960	62800	you already know what I'm talking about. It's fucking ridiculous. This one says volume up.
62800	66800	Should I turn the volume up? Here. I'll turn the volume up just for this one video.
69280	69920	Oh my God.
73840	82880	How did you like glue your hair down, lady? Yeah, it's called ballroom hair.
83760	87920	So I guess it's all held in place by some sort of some sort of gorilla glue.
88960	96560	Oh, why would you do this to yourself?
104880	111760	Ah, just cut it all off. It's done lady.
111760	121120	Oh my God. It's like a shell over her head. Well, what did you expect would happen? I swear
121120	124640	to God, guys, you're just sending it. You're not even sending me tech talks that I can actually
124640	129360	comment on or make a point or like a, like political tech talks. You're sending me like
129360	137440	nonsense now, like people being retards. Show me some fucking respect. Did you ever consider
137440	142000	setting up somewhere for us to actually school board fight guys. So we're doing it ourselves.
149360	150640	Who added in the sound of that?
153760	157120	Oh my God. We will identify as a fucking problem.
159360	160320	The same goes for you.
160320	164960	Why, why, why can't you allow both sides of the issue?
171280	176560	So what it seems like is as if you want free speech, as long as it benefits you,
176560	181600	as long as you get what you want. Yep. That's how they operate, dude. That's how it is. You
181600	186320	got to figure it out. So it looked like there was a bunch of trans people coming in and disrupting
186320	189600	some sort of school board meeting or some kind of meeting. Something was going on probably over
189600	194720	like the trans kids thing, which is all the rage right now. Hold on. Let's watch it a bit though.
200400	205760	This person here is speaking and that was like a very feminine sounding voice.
206400	212240	You know, is this person actually trans or are they like a she, they non-binary therefore trans,
212240	216160	even though they're not transitioning in on hormones. Like a lot of the people here seem
216160	221280	like that. They seem like she, theys or he, theys. You know what I mean? Now who knows?
221280	226080	I could be wrong. My transdar is like somewhat accurate, but it's not, you know, it's not perfect.
226080	233840	So who knows? Like this person here seems more like a gender goblin or something. You know,
233840	238880	someone who's like non-passing, but that initial speaker, that was someone who was seen definitely
238880	244560	like a she, they, who just is like a masculine woman kind of tomboyish, but not really trans,
244560	247040	but in 2023, she can call herself trans, you know?
247040	249200	My goal is not to pass.
249200	249760	What?
249760	254480	My goal is to present in a way that makes other people go, okay, this person probably wants to
254480	259360	be called she, her, not to make them think that I'm a cisgender woman. I don't mind people knowing
259360	263520	I'm trans. In fact, in many cases, I want them to know that I'm trans. I want them to know that a
263520	269520	trans person can take up space in the same space they are, especially as someone in STEM. I deserve
269520	275040	to be here and I need younger trans people to see that. I think it'd be a better world for trans
275040	280160	and non-binary people if nobody assumed anyone's gender or even their pronouns for that matter.
280160	285120	What's the difference between you and a cross-dresser then? Because the whole point
285120	288560	of cross-dresses is that like, yeah, they're cross-dressing, but you can kind of tell,
288560	293360	right? You look at like a passing trans woman and a cross-dresser are not the same thing.
293360	297680	Cross-dresser is supposed to be like, yep, got it. Man in a dress. They're playing with gender
297680	303120	in a weird way. I understand where the trans woman, the point is to stealth. This person's
303120	309840	like, no, I want to be clocked. I want people to notice that I'm actually a dude. What the,
309840	313840	why? You know what? I was so stunned. I missed the end of the, of the video. Let me just play it
313840	318000	again real quick. I want them to know that a trans person can take up space in the same space they
318000	323840	are, especially as someone in STEM. Isn't that part of the joke is that there's tons of trans
323840	328160	people in STEM? Like they're vastly overrepresented in STEM. I think it'd be a
328160	331920	better world for trans and non-binary people if nobody assumed anyone's gender,
332560	337680	or even their pronouns for that matter. Why? Assuming people's gender is kind of a fundamental
337680	341920	part of being human. The main reason for that is reproduction, right? Like you have a guy,
341920	345440	looks like a guy. You have a girl, looks like a girl. They see each other. They're attracted
345440	350000	to each other. They assume that they have genitals that are compatible for reproduction. If it turns
350000	353280	out that one of them doesn't, well then they feel like they've been betrayed because that's
353280	358320	a reasonable assumption to make. The world is actually better that we assume gender. Things
358320	362560	are more functional that way. Now there's always going to be outliers where that assumption doesn't
362560	370080	apply, but we should not tailor the entirety of society for the outliers. I am not, sir. Oh God.
372880	378560	Do you want to say that to the camera? Hundreds and hundreds of people watching you. Well,
378560	384960	this person has an audience, eh? No, go ahead. You just called me a man. Don't be a coward.
385680	389680	Don't be a coward. Okay, dude, use some voice training or something. Jesus.
389680	394800	Say what you got to say to me. Oh, you don't want to call me a man. Is that a Che Guevara
394800	398240	shirt in the background? Yes, it is. What do you got to say? What do you got to say? What do you
398240	405840	got to say? What do you got to say? Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. I did not know this man was trans. This
406640	413440	what do you go by? Does it matter? It does because I'm asking you. This guy sounds like a troll.
414320	417360	There's a lot of people watching. The real question is, it doesn't matter if you're
417360	420720	transgender or not. Are you with that? Are you with the, are you with the people that
420720	425920	march and be like, we're coming for your kids. That's where it's bad. Yep. That's when he gets
426000	434160	this guy. Yeah, he's got it. What's your name? Me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What's your name?
435920	440320	You certainly don't. What's your name? JJ. And is your thing a cult?
445520	448160	Oh my God. This is fucking hilarious.
450720	453520	Wait, the staff. These are just random. Why you didn't step in?
454000	459200	They're just random passerbys, dude. You're standing and watching. They called me a pedophile.
459200	478880	Wait, no, they didn't call you. Oh my God. Listen, I don't know about you. Like a lot of things went
478880	482400	crazy in that, especially when she was like, they called me a pedophile. No, they didn't.
482400	485520	All right. But here, if someone's like, do you want to say that to the camera? I'd be just be
485520	492320	like, yes, get your head. I I've been waiting for months and years of my life to have a situation
492320	497280	like this happened to me to unleash the maximum troll effect. And have you planned how to gain
497280	502560	my concern? For I would rather gouge out my eyes than permit someone who speaks so disrespectfully
502560	507280	of women within 50 feet of me. Hold on. I got to watch that one again too, because I don't know
507280	515200	what's going on. Hold on. Okay. Hold on. Okay. Tonight's tug sorted. I have so many questions.
515200	519440	What does this mean? And have you planned how to gain my consent? For I would rather
519440	524800	gouge out my eyes than permit someone who speaks so disrespectfully of women within 50 feet of me.
524800	529360	Okay. Where's the JonTron thing. I have several questions. You know what I'm talking about? Okay.
529360	537680	Okay. Firstly tonight's tug sorted. Question one, why is this your tug? Why this, this person,
537680	541440	maybe you just like really fat chicks. I don't know, but like, this isn't going to be most
541440	549920	people's tug for tonight. Okay. Secondly, why is she dressed up as an elf and why is she replying
549920	557040	in the character of an elf? I, I don't know. Is this, have we stumbled onto like a LARPing corner
557040	563440	of TikTok where they just role play as their character in their replies? I guess. Question
564560	570160	three. Listen to the video again. And have you planned how to gain my consent? Okay. So,
570160	577680	Oh my God. That was quite the cross-eyed stare to start the video on. Okay. So she immediately says
578320	586240	that you need her consent to masturbate to her. Now is it, are we, are we going to go down like
586240	591680	the whole, this is masturbation rape. Like it's masturbation sexual assault. If you jack off to
591680	595440	another girl who like, who actually exists in real life, you don't tell her like you just fantasize
595440	600240	about her in your own head. That's a form of sexual assault or a form of rape. I've heard
600240	604720	some weird progressive say that like, it's not necessarily that common in lefty spaces,
604720	609200	but I've definitely heard some like rad femmes say that, right. That if you masturbate to someone
609200	613520	who exists without their permission, you're sexually assaulting them like psychically or
613520	618720	something. And I guess that's her logic because this person says tonight's tug sorted and she
618720	622240	goes, well, you need my consent for that bucko. Like, what are you going to do? Are you going
622240	626560	to call up the precogs and have them arrest this guy for psychic crimes or something?
626560	630160	Okay. I think, I think I'm done for today. Thanks very much. Right after this goes up,
630160	634560	I'll be streaming. So make sure that you drop in and say hello. I'll be playing some more
634560	639280	Starfield because it's a great game. Have a good one, everyone. I love you.
