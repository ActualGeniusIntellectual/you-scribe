00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
Hey, hey, hey. Welcome to Tech Talk Tuesday. Guess what else I recorded today along with

00:04.240 --> 00:10.640
Tech Talk Tuesday? A new video. That's right. Like an actual real video. It's coming. I mean,

00:10.640 --> 00:13.760
hopefully you'll see it tomorrow as long as Dave gets the editing done. I mean, we'll see,

00:13.760 --> 00:19.200
we'll see. But dude, I broke the writer's block. I'm finally doing it again. It feels good, man.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.160
Let's hope I don't somehow destroy myself. But for now things are going okay. Okay. Let's see

00:24.160 --> 00:28.880
what we've got today. Disgusting. Disgusting. I just wanted to talk about drive-through because

00:28.880 --> 00:34.640
I'm a whore for Taco Bell. Yeah. And do you know how they greeted me? How? They said,

00:36.000 --> 00:41.440
hello ma'am. You are a ma'am. And then after handing me my food, said, thank you ma'am,

00:41.440 --> 00:49.200
have a good day. Bitch, what about me? Says ma'am. I have a fucking red mullet. Your voice.

00:50.160 --> 00:55.120
Your voice, dude, your face. Everything about you screams ma'am. You're a tomboy. All right.

00:57.120 --> 01:03.280
I hate to say it. I think I'm like 99% done with the non-binary thing. I know there's like a few

01:03.280 --> 01:08.400
people that it really does work for, but most of these people, they're just tomboys. They'd be

01:08.400 --> 01:12.880
tomboys back in the nineties and two thousands. No one would give a shit. There's a strange phenomenon

01:12.880 --> 01:16.880
now where like, if you're young, you're kind of exploring the world, right? Like you're kind of

01:16.880 --> 01:20.480
like, you're striking out on your own for your first time. You're developing your own personality,

01:20.480 --> 01:23.840
your own sense of self. So maybe you're going to be like emo or going to be goth or maybe you're

01:23.840 --> 01:26.880
going to be like a scene kid or like, you know, this is how it was back in the day, right?

01:26.880 --> 01:30.480
You would just be like, what works for me? I'm going to experiment with style. We're

01:30.480 --> 01:35.280
an experiment with like ways of presenting and ways of like, like, how am I going to be myself?

01:35.280 --> 01:39.120
And all these experimentations, it was kind of dumb and cringy, but like it's young kids,

01:39.120 --> 01:42.880
fine. You know, kids, sometimes 20 somethings, you know, they're doing whatever they're figuring

01:42.880 --> 01:48.320
themselves out all completely normal, completely fine. However, there was this expectation that

01:48.320 --> 01:51.840
for most of them, not all of them, but most of them, they would grow out of it. All right.

01:51.840 --> 01:55.920
Most emo girls did not remain emo girls throughout high school and then throughout college and then

01:55.920 --> 01:59.120
into their thirties when they started having kids, their styles changed as they got older.

01:59.120 --> 02:04.480
That's normal. That's natural. However, you can't say that it's like a stylistic choice

02:04.480 --> 02:09.200
that is going to be something to grow out of later because now it's not a stylistic choice.

02:09.200 --> 02:13.200
It's a gender. Now it's a gender and you're a bigot if you say, oh, oh, you're a tomboy.

02:13.200 --> 02:17.200
You might grow out of that. No, no. It's my gender now. I fucking hate this shit. Like,

02:17.200 --> 02:22.400
it's so stupid. You are a girl. There's nothing masculine about you. You're not non-binary.

02:22.400 --> 02:27.040
Get over it. The caption here is you guys, this TikTok filter keeps misgendering me. Look,

02:27.040 --> 02:36.720
okay. Let's see. Let's see. Okay. Let's go. Oh, no, no fucking way. No way. Oh,

02:36.800 --> 02:42.800
missing an anime. Okay. Okay. We're going to try this. Okay. Let's see.

02:44.800 --> 02:48.880
Hell no. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Okay. Let's try again. Okay.

02:55.120 --> 02:59.920
Dude, that last one was me with my, my, my like SFO kind of avatars drawn. Sometimes, sometimes,

02:59.920 --> 03:03.520
sometimes it'd be like that. It's, it's, it's really funny. It's probably frustrating to be

03:03.520 --> 03:07.520
like a trans woman with like a masculine jaw. And then like the TikTok filter draws

03:07.520 --> 03:13.120
you as a man every time. That's frustrating, but it's also pretty funny, dude. Ooh, there's a Ninja.

03:13.920 --> 03:27.040
Yeah. That's funny. I think the funniest content on the internet nowadays, isn't like this highly

03:27.040 --> 03:32.800
produced content from like corporate channels. It's just random people doing goofy shit,

03:32.800 --> 03:36.560
like on their own and they're like in their houses or in their front lawns or whatever.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.360
It's always been that I've always been the funniest stuff. It's always been the best stuff

03:39.360 --> 03:45.520
on the internet, dude. Oh, I've heard about this one. So this is like a leftist who confronts a,

03:45.520 --> 03:50.080
um, a Christian protester over it's either abortion or it's trans stuff or it's something,

03:50.720 --> 03:56.320
but they try to rope in like a Muslim protester thinking that because they're Muslim,

03:56.320 --> 03:59.280
they're part of the progressive stack and they're going to join them. But it goes,

03:59.440 --> 04:01.680
okay, you just have to watch it. I've seen this before. Okay, let's go.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.680
They agree, dude. They're Muslims. They agree.

04:30.080 --> 04:36.560
You can't say anything against the Brown religion because it'd be racist.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.320
Muslims win out in the progressive stack. It's the LGBTs.

04:40.320 --> 05:00.080
Yeah. He's like, I just got to leave. I can't fucking cut dude.

05:00.080 --> 05:03.840
Cucked liberals are saying this shit. Real liberals, not like American,

05:03.840 --> 05:06.960
like leftist liberals, real liberals are saying this shit like eight years ago,

05:06.960 --> 05:12.480
like don't bring in a bunch of people who are going to be anti LGBT and expect them to side

05:12.480 --> 05:16.960
with you on your next progressive project. There is no solidarity there. They fucking hate you,

05:16.960 --> 05:21.600
dude. They hate your way of life. They think it's sinful. It's sodomy. It's all this like, they,

05:21.600 --> 05:25.680
no, they don't like this shit, man. The progressive's abandoned liberalism then

05:25.680 --> 05:30.240
like threw themselves to the wolves. No one deserves to die. Like no one's saying anyone

05:30.240 --> 05:33.440
on the side deserves to die. You're all saying that shit. You're saying they're all colonizers.

05:33.760 --> 05:38.480
To do this. Like I think if not all of them, a large majority of them had to serve in the

05:38.480 --> 05:42.320
military at one point and they're occupying Palestinian land. So yeah.

05:42.320 --> 05:46.080
So yeah, you just want to kill the Jews. Simple as that, right? I'm going to have to do a video,

05:46.080 --> 05:49.840
I think on the Israel Palestine thing. I mean, maybe not the entire history of the conflict.

05:49.840 --> 05:56.560
That's a very, very long history to be honest, but just the recent reaction of like seeing so

05:56.560 --> 06:01.920
many leftists come out as Nazis and we all knew those of us who like are in the center,

06:01.920 --> 06:05.920
we all knew they were Nazis deep down. We were waiting for them to show it. It took them like

06:05.920 --> 06:10.800
years, but they finally did show it. The good moral pro working class left that never actually

06:10.800 --> 06:14.880
existed. They're all just like bloodthirsty freaks. Let me correct myself real quick.

06:14.880 --> 06:18.160
Socialist. There are some good progressives. I mean, I'm not a progressive, but there are

06:18.160 --> 06:21.040
some okay progressives, but like most socialists are just garbage.

06:21.040 --> 06:29.920
Well, what is she doing? Oh my God. Just, just ruin everything. Get the fuck out, lady.

06:32.240 --> 06:35.040
Yep. Got to fight her, dude. No more of this shoplifting,

06:35.040 --> 06:37.120
no more of this destroying places shit. Fuck you.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.400
Don't record. No, I'm record. I record this shit too.

06:45.040 --> 06:53.600
Oh, white trash is arresting you? Dude. Fuck this bitch, man. She's getting what she deserves.

06:59.760 --> 07:07.120
Oh my God. Is she possessed? Take me to jail. Fucking hell dude. Oh my God.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.920
There might be another one that I have kind of saved up where it's like more,

07:10.480 --> 07:13.840
you know, more shoplifting or like fights in the, in the store kind of footage.

07:13.920 --> 07:16.720
I'm going to find it real quick. Oh yeah. Here's the second half of it.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.600
Why, what do you mean racist?

07:27.680 --> 07:30.880
You're being arrested for trash in the store. You fucking moron.

07:37.600 --> 07:42.320
Dude, uh, Walmart is racist. Now I have more of an excuse to shop there. Okay. This,

07:42.320 --> 07:47.040
this woman's fucking delusional, man. She's like, I hate that we have actually gotten to

07:47.040 --> 07:51.840
this point where you have black people who act this ridiculously in public and then shriek

07:51.840 --> 07:56.320
once they're like rightly stopped that Walmart is racist or the cops are racist or that you're

07:56.320 --> 08:00.480
racist or that someone else is racist. It's like, shut the fuck up lady. But yeah, here's the other

08:00.480 --> 08:04.880
one. I got a mutex that has some cooperative music in it. And I was like, we're not gonna take it.

08:04.880 --> 08:11.120
You know that song? Well, this guy's shoplifting here, right? And it's just, I think it's random

08:11.120 --> 08:15.120
customers that are holding them back now. It's like, no, you don't. Everyone is tired

08:15.120 --> 08:19.760
of people shoplifting. They're tired of like the social fabric being frayed in their communities.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.760
They're tired of stores losing money and going out of business and closing up because they can't shop

08:23.760 --> 08:27.920
there anymore. Everyone's tired of this shit. And if the stores aren't going to get involved

08:27.920 --> 08:30.960
and the cops aren't going to get involved in the security, isn't going to get involved.

08:30.960 --> 08:35.600
Now you have customers getting involved. I've been saying this for like every tick talk Tuesday,

08:35.600 --> 08:40.720
all year long. This is escalating and it's getting worse. These thieves are making things worse for

08:40.720 --> 08:46.640
themselves and for everyone. This is not a good situation. I feel like Hannah Montana. Yeah.

08:47.360 --> 08:54.640
Because how am I a hair salon receptionist? Yeah. And also playing EVC this month. Oh dude,

08:54.640 --> 09:02.080
she's doing it. That's awesome. Good for her. She made it. I guess she's just pissed that she also

09:02.080 --> 09:06.000
has to keep that day job right now. But I mean, that's a pretty big crowd. It seems like her

09:06.000 --> 09:09.440
career is growing. You know, the side hustle is working out. What's the problem? Oh, the person

09:09.440 --> 09:13.680
who sent me the sent along a tweet that was accompanying it. Let's take a look at it here.

09:14.400 --> 09:19.360
Okay. The person who posted the video said it's okay to have a day job to support your dream job.

09:19.360 --> 09:25.600
And then the actual girl in the video replied with the comments on this shit is like goals and girl

09:25.600 --> 09:32.240
boss. I am not a girl boss. I am a victim to capitalism. I am drowning. It's a cry for help.

09:32.240 --> 09:38.240
Are you shitting me lady? You're bitching because your dream job can't actually support

09:38.240 --> 09:42.480
you. Is that what you're bitching about? Do you think you'd be able to even have this dream job

09:42.480 --> 09:47.280
under any other economic system? The answer is no. The commissar would point the gun at you and

09:47.280 --> 09:51.360
say, dig the fucking holes or even more likely get on your fucking back. Cause that's how,

09:51.360 --> 09:54.880
that's how this shit works when you're not living in a capitalist society. I'm a victim to

09:54.880 --> 09:59.120
capitalism. Yeah. You mean the system that allows you to do this shit in the first place. Fuck you.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.840
All right, guy. I hate the entitlement of these fucking people. Oh man. My side hustle isn't

10:03.840 --> 10:08.960
working out and I'm not the big fucking star that I thought I would be. Guess what? Keep working or

10:08.960 --> 10:12.320
not, or give up and bitch about on the internet. Like I don't fucking care. You are not drowning

10:12.320 --> 10:17.040
because you have to provide for yourself. You fucking child. All right. Let's do one final

10:17.040 --> 10:30.080
short one to, uh, to round the day off. Oh, oh, oh, oh my God. Oh, the food, dude. Oh,

10:31.040 --> 10:39.360
I, there was music in that one too, but oh, oh man. My soul just sunk as soon as that happened.

10:39.360 --> 10:45.680
Oh, it's all, it's all gone. Well, that was kind of a downward end. Nothing bugs a fat guy more

10:45.680 --> 10:50.080
than losing all the food. Okay. Listen, thanks for being here. Everyone. Thanks for watching all the

10:50.080 --> 10:57.200
tech talks today. As I said, new video recorded, hopefully you'll see it tomorrow. And of course

10:57.200 --> 11:02.080
I'm streaming tonight. So I want you to come by and say hi. I'll see you there.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.400
Have a good one guys. I love you.
