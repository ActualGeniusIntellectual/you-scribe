0	4240	Hey, hey, hey. Welcome to Tech Talk Tuesday. Guess what else I recorded today along with
4240	10640	Tech Talk Tuesday? A new video. That's right. Like an actual real video. It's coming. I mean,
10640	13760	hopefully you'll see it tomorrow as long as Dave gets the editing done. I mean, we'll see,
13760	19200	we'll see. But dude, I broke the writer's block. I'm finally doing it again. It feels good, man.
19200	24160	Let's hope I don't somehow destroy myself. But for now things are going okay. Okay. Let's see
24160	28880	what we've got today. Disgusting. Disgusting. I just wanted to talk about drive-through because
28880	34640	I'm a whore for Taco Bell. Yeah. And do you know how they greeted me? How? They said,
36000	41440	hello ma'am. You are a ma'am. And then after handing me my food, said, thank you ma'am,
41440	49200	have a good day. Bitch, what about me? Says ma'am. I have a fucking red mullet. Your voice.
50160	55120	Your voice, dude, your face. Everything about you screams ma'am. You're a tomboy. All right.
57120	63280	I hate to say it. I think I'm like 99% done with the non-binary thing. I know there's like a few
63280	68400	people that it really does work for, but most of these people, they're just tomboys. They'd be
68400	72880	tomboys back in the nineties and two thousands. No one would give a shit. There's a strange phenomenon
72880	76880	now where like, if you're young, you're kind of exploring the world, right? Like you're kind of
76880	80480	like, you're striking out on your own for your first time. You're developing your own personality,
80480	83840	your own sense of self. So maybe you're going to be like emo or going to be goth or maybe you're
83840	86880	going to be like a scene kid or like, you know, this is how it was back in the day, right?
86880	90480	You would just be like, what works for me? I'm going to experiment with style. We're
90480	95280	an experiment with like ways of presenting and ways of like, like, how am I going to be myself?
95280	99120	And all these experimentations, it was kind of dumb and cringy, but like it's young kids,
99120	102880	fine. You know, kids, sometimes 20 somethings, you know, they're doing whatever they're figuring
102880	108320	themselves out all completely normal, completely fine. However, there was this expectation that
108320	111840	for most of them, not all of them, but most of them, they would grow out of it. All right.
111840	115920	Most emo girls did not remain emo girls throughout high school and then throughout college and then
115920	119120	into their thirties when they started having kids, their styles changed as they got older.
119120	124480	That's normal. That's natural. However, you can't say that it's like a stylistic choice
124480	129200	that is going to be something to grow out of later because now it's not a stylistic choice.
129200	133200	It's a gender. Now it's a gender and you're a bigot if you say, oh, oh, you're a tomboy.
133200	137200	You might grow out of that. No, no. It's my gender now. I fucking hate this shit. Like,
137200	142400	it's so stupid. You are a girl. There's nothing masculine about you. You're not non-binary.
142400	147040	Get over it. The caption here is you guys, this TikTok filter keeps misgendering me. Look,
147040	156720	okay. Let's see. Let's see. Okay. Let's go. Oh, no, no fucking way. No way. Oh,
156800	162800	missing an anime. Okay. Okay. We're going to try this. Okay. Let's see.
164800	168880	Hell no. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Okay. Let's try again. Okay.
175120	179920	Dude, that last one was me with my, my, my like SFO kind of avatars drawn. Sometimes, sometimes,
179920	183520	sometimes it'd be like that. It's, it's, it's really funny. It's probably frustrating to be
183520	187520	like a trans woman with like a masculine jaw. And then like the TikTok filter draws
187520	193120	you as a man every time. That's frustrating, but it's also pretty funny, dude. Ooh, there's a Ninja.
193920	207040	Yeah. That's funny. I think the funniest content on the internet nowadays, isn't like this highly
207040	212800	produced content from like corporate channels. It's just random people doing goofy shit,
212800	216560	like on their own and they're like in their houses or in their front lawns or whatever.
216560	219360	It's always been that I've always been the funniest stuff. It's always been the best stuff
219360	225520	on the internet, dude. Oh, I've heard about this one. So this is like a leftist who confronts a,
225520	230080	um, a Christian protester over it's either abortion or it's trans stuff or it's something,
230720	236320	but they try to rope in like a Muslim protester thinking that because they're Muslim,
236320	239280	they're part of the progressive stack and they're going to join them. But it goes,
239440	241680	okay, you just have to watch it. I've seen this before. Okay, let's go.
259360	261680	They agree, dude. They're Muslims. They agree.
270080	276560	You can't say anything against the Brown religion because it'd be racist.
277520	280320	Muslims win out in the progressive stack. It's the LGBTs.
280320	300080	Yeah. He's like, I just got to leave. I can't fucking cut dude.
300080	303840	Cucked liberals are saying this shit. Real liberals, not like American,
303840	306960	like leftist liberals, real liberals are saying this shit like eight years ago,
306960	312480	like don't bring in a bunch of people who are going to be anti LGBT and expect them to side
312480	316960	with you on your next progressive project. There is no solidarity there. They fucking hate you,
316960	321600	dude. They hate your way of life. They think it's sinful. It's sodomy. It's all this like, they,
321600	325680	no, they don't like this shit, man. The progressive's abandoned liberalism then
325680	330240	like threw themselves to the wolves. No one deserves to die. Like no one's saying anyone
330240	333440	on the side deserves to die. You're all saying that shit. You're saying they're all colonizers.
333760	338480	To do this. Like I think if not all of them, a large majority of them had to serve in the
338480	342320	military at one point and they're occupying Palestinian land. So yeah.
342320	346080	So yeah, you just want to kill the Jews. Simple as that, right? I'm going to have to do a video,
346080	349840	I think on the Israel Palestine thing. I mean, maybe not the entire history of the conflict.
349840	356560	That's a very, very long history to be honest, but just the recent reaction of like seeing so
356560	361920	many leftists come out as Nazis and we all knew those of us who like are in the center,
361920	365920	we all knew they were Nazis deep down. We were waiting for them to show it. It took them like
365920	370800	years, but they finally did show it. The good moral pro working class left that never actually
370800	374880	existed. They're all just like bloodthirsty freaks. Let me correct myself real quick.
374880	378160	Socialist. There are some good progressives. I mean, I'm not a progressive, but there are
378160	381040	some okay progressives, but like most socialists are just garbage.
381040	389920	Well, what is she doing? Oh my God. Just, just ruin everything. Get the fuck out, lady.
392240	395040	Yep. Got to fight her, dude. No more of this shoplifting,
395040	397120	no more of this destroying places shit. Fuck you.
401920	404400	Don't record. No, I'm record. I record this shit too.
405040	413600	Oh, white trash is arresting you? Dude. Fuck this bitch, man. She's getting what she deserves.
419760	427120	Oh my God. Is she possessed? Take me to jail. Fucking hell dude. Oh my God.
427120	429920	There might be another one that I have kind of saved up where it's like more,
430480	433840	you know, more shoplifting or like fights in the, in the store kind of footage.
433920	436720	I'm going to find it real quick. Oh yeah. Here's the second half of it.
444240	445600	Why, what do you mean racist?
447680	450880	You're being arrested for trash in the store. You fucking moron.
457600	462320	Dude, uh, Walmart is racist. Now I have more of an excuse to shop there. Okay. This,
462320	467040	this woman's fucking delusional, man. She's like, I hate that we have actually gotten to
467040	471840	this point where you have black people who act this ridiculously in public and then shriek
471840	476320	once they're like rightly stopped that Walmart is racist or the cops are racist or that you're
476320	480480	racist or that someone else is racist. It's like, shut the fuck up lady. But yeah, here's the other
480480	484880	one. I got a mutex that has some cooperative music in it. And I was like, we're not gonna take it.
484880	491120	You know that song? Well, this guy's shoplifting here, right? And it's just, I think it's random
491120	495120	customers that are holding them back now. It's like, no, you don't. Everyone is tired
495120	499760	of people shoplifting. They're tired of like the social fabric being frayed in their communities.
499760	503760	They're tired of stores losing money and going out of business and closing up because they can't shop
503760	507920	there anymore. Everyone's tired of this shit. And if the stores aren't going to get involved
507920	510960	and the cops aren't going to get involved in the security, isn't going to get involved.
510960	515600	Now you have customers getting involved. I've been saying this for like every tick talk Tuesday,
515600	520720	all year long. This is escalating and it's getting worse. These thieves are making things worse for
520720	526640	themselves and for everyone. This is not a good situation. I feel like Hannah Montana. Yeah.
527360	534640	Because how am I a hair salon receptionist? Yeah. And also playing EVC this month. Oh dude,
534640	542080	she's doing it. That's awesome. Good for her. She made it. I guess she's just pissed that she also
542080	546000	has to keep that day job right now. But I mean, that's a pretty big crowd. It seems like her
546000	549440	career is growing. You know, the side hustle is working out. What's the problem? Oh, the person
549440	553680	who sent me the sent along a tweet that was accompanying it. Let's take a look at it here.
554400	559360	Okay. The person who posted the video said it's okay to have a day job to support your dream job.
559360	565600	And then the actual girl in the video replied with the comments on this shit is like goals and girl
565600	572240	boss. I am not a girl boss. I am a victim to capitalism. I am drowning. It's a cry for help.
572240	578240	Are you shitting me lady? You're bitching because your dream job can't actually support
578240	582480	you. Is that what you're bitching about? Do you think you'd be able to even have this dream job
582480	587280	under any other economic system? The answer is no. The commissar would point the gun at you and
587280	591360	say, dig the fucking holes or even more likely get on your fucking back. Cause that's how,
591360	594880	that's how this shit works when you're not living in a capitalist society. I'm a victim to
594880	599120	capitalism. Yeah. You mean the system that allows you to do this shit in the first place. Fuck you.
599120	603840	All right, guy. I hate the entitlement of these fucking people. Oh man. My side hustle isn't
603840	608960	working out and I'm not the big fucking star that I thought I would be. Guess what? Keep working or
608960	612320	not, or give up and bitch about on the internet. Like I don't fucking care. You are not drowning
612320	617040	because you have to provide for yourself. You fucking child. All right. Let's do one final
617040	630080	short one to, uh, to round the day off. Oh, oh, oh, oh my God. Oh, the food, dude. Oh,
631040	639360	I, there was music in that one too, but oh, oh man. My soul just sunk as soon as that happened.
639360	645680	Oh, it's all, it's all gone. Well, that was kind of a downward end. Nothing bugs a fat guy more
645680	650080	than losing all the food. Okay. Listen, thanks for being here. Everyone. Thanks for watching all the
650080	657200	tech talks today. As I said, new video recorded, hopefully you'll see it tomorrow. And of course
657200	662080	I'm streaming tonight. So I want you to come by and say hi. I'll see you there.
662080	664400	Have a good one guys. I love you.
