So people are looking for the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure stream that I did with Lilith Lovett,

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,960
where we talked about Joe Jorgensen's impact on the 2020 election, and I think that stream is lost

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,000
to time. I can't find an archived copy of it, it's no longer up on YouTube, and the file that I

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,960
uploaded to Bitchute is refusing to process, so I think, unfortunately, that might just be a video

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,400
that is gone. I hate to say it, because I really don't like the idea of the canon of my content

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,400
having a hole in it, but I can't find the file. I just can't find the file. I think I deleted it

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,160
after uploading it to Bitchute, but I didn't wait for it to process, and now it's gone. I'm really

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,040
sorry. So if you're looking for that stream, unless I find it somewhere, I think it's been

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,200
lost to time. Don't worry, I'm pissed at myself too. I'm sorry about this. I'll talk to you later.

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,080
I love you.
