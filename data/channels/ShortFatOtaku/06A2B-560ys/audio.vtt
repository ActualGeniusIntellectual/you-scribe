So people are looking for the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure stream that I did with Lilith Lovett,

00:04.960 --> 00:10.960
where we talked about Joe Jorgensen's impact on the 2020 election, and I think that stream is lost

00:10.960 --> 00:16.000
to time. I can't find an archived copy of it, it's no longer up on YouTube, and the file that I

00:16.000 --> 00:22.960
uploaded to Bitchute is refusing to process, so I think, unfortunately, that might just be a video

00:22.960 --> 00:28.400
that is gone. I hate to say it, because I really don't like the idea of the canon of my content

00:28.400 --> 00:34.400
having a hole in it, but I can't find the file. I just can't find the file. I think I deleted it

00:34.400 --> 00:38.160
after uploading it to Bitchute, but I didn't wait for it to process, and now it's gone. I'm really

00:38.160 --> 00:45.040
sorry. So if you're looking for that stream, unless I find it somewhere, I think it's been

00:45.040 --> 00:51.200
lost to time. Don't worry, I'm pissed at myself too. I'm sorry about this. I'll talk to you later.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.080
I love you.
