{"text": " So people are looking for the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure stream that I did with Lilith Lovett, where we talked about Joe Jorgensen's impact on the 2020 election, and I think that stream is lost to time. I can't find an archived copy of it, it's no longer up on YouTube, and the file that I uploaded to Bitchute is refusing to process, so I think, unfortunately, that might just be a video that is gone. I hate to say it, because I really don't like the idea of the canon of my content having a hole in it, but I can't find the file. I just can't find the file. I think I deleted it after uploading it to Bitchute, but I didn't wait for it to process, and now it's gone. I'm really sorry. So if you're looking for that stream, unless I find it somewhere, I think it's been lost to time. Don't worry, I'm pissed at myself too. I'm sorry about this. I'll talk to you later.
