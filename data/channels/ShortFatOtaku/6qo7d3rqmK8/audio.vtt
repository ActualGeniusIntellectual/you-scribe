00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
This video serves partially as a reply to Sargon of Akkad's video,

00:03.760 --> 00:06.960
The False Narrative of the Working Poor, and also to a lesser extent,

00:06.960 --> 00:10.080
the video from which it sprang, what the Conservative Party did next.

00:10.080 --> 00:13.200
However I also have some other related topics to throw in as well. I do

00:13.200 --> 00:15.920
recommend you go back and watch those videos if you haven't already because

00:15.920 --> 00:18.080
they're quite good. But for those of you who don't know,

00:18.080 --> 00:21.840
in The False Narrative of the Working Poor, Sargon outlines exactly how much

00:21.840 --> 00:25.680
somebody would make in the UK with a minimum wage paying job working 40 hours

00:25.680 --> 00:28.400
a week, and then subtracts various expenses from

00:28.400 --> 00:32.160
that sum in order to discover the total amount one would have left over,

00:32.160 --> 00:36.000
in order to dispute the idea that the working poor are just lazy bums taking

00:36.000 --> 00:38.320
benefits. Now I don't have any concrete numbers

00:38.320 --> 00:42.240
like Sargon did, but let me tell you about my status as one of Canada's

00:42.240 --> 00:45.760
working poor. I understand that this example is going to be quite subjective,

00:45.760 --> 00:49.680
but I still think there's some truth to it. At the very least it's realistic and

00:49.680 --> 00:52.960
possible to live this way, considering that I'm actually doing it. I

00:52.960 --> 00:55.760
live in a decent-sized urban centre in Canada.

00:55.760 --> 00:59.200
Not one of the big three of Vancouver, Montreal, or the GTA,

00:59.200 --> 01:02.640
where upper-class hipsters have gentrified large portions of the city,

01:02.640 --> 01:06.640
driving up prices massively, similar to America's own Trust Fund

01:06.640 --> 01:09.520
Baby Centres of Southern California and the Northwest Corridor.

01:09.520 --> 01:13.520
But the city in which I live is still a medium-sized city. It's still considered

01:13.520 --> 01:17.760
a regional centre for industry, culture, education, and healthcare. I live in a

01:17.760 --> 01:22.400
middle-class area of the city. Older houses, lots of rentals, lots of

01:22.400 --> 01:26.480
students, not much in the way of crime, no big lakeside mansions, but also not a

01:26.480 --> 01:30.560
ghetto. Here's a bit of math off the top of my head. To live here I pay $400 a

01:30.560 --> 01:34.880
month, including water and hydro. Internet comes out to $35 a month,

01:34.880 --> 01:39.680
and I budget my food at around $25 a week. Again, I'm not eating

01:39.680 --> 01:42.560
gourmet food, but I'm also not eating poorly. It's

01:42.560 --> 01:47.440
nutritious, if not boring, fair. The minimum wage right now is $11.25 an

01:47.440 --> 01:50.800
hour, and I get an average of 20 hours a week at my boring,

01:50.800 --> 01:54.720
soul-crushing grocery store job. Taking out things like union fees and Canada

01:54.720 --> 01:59.040
pension, I can expect to make around $200 a week and $800 a month.

01:59.040 --> 02:03.600
Depending on various factors, I've seen that go as low as $600 a month and as

02:03.600 --> 02:09.600
high as $1200. On an average $800 a month, rent consumes $400 of that money,

02:09.600 --> 02:15.680
food takes another $100, and internet takes $35. That leaves $365 to handle

02:15.680 --> 02:19.200
other expenses. I don't have a phone, I don't find myself needing much in the

02:19.200 --> 02:22.640
way of new clothing or shoes, I don't pay for a city bus pass because I ride

02:22.640 --> 02:26.240
my bicycle everywhere I go. Yes, including during the winter. Learning

02:26.240 --> 02:29.760
how to winter bike ultimately became a godsend when it comes to transportation

02:29.760 --> 02:32.640
around the city. Nonetheless, I don't save much of my

02:32.640 --> 02:35.840
extra money. I usually end up putting the money into some of my hobbies or

02:35.840 --> 02:39.600
passions, or picking up something for the YouTube channel like games or anime or

02:39.600 --> 02:43.120
equipment or props, or sometimes we'll need something new for the house like

02:43.120 --> 02:45.600
kitchen supplies or toiletries or whatever.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.160
And yes, once in a while I'll spend on a social event or a gift or eat out with

02:50.160 --> 02:53.680
friends or order a pizza for a movie night or something. I don't come out of

02:53.680 --> 02:57.360
the month with much in the way of saved money, but I live a pretty comfortable

02:57.360 --> 03:01.760
average working class bachelor existence. Somebody living where I am, who is

03:01.760 --> 03:06.000
working a full 40 hours a week, full time, even at minimum wage, would find

03:06.000 --> 03:08.960
themselves in a position to save up enough to purchase a vehicle in just a

03:08.960 --> 03:13.200
couple of years. Yes, it would require them living a Spartan life for a period

03:13.200 --> 03:17.360
of time, but it's not impossible. Upward mobility is possible even on

03:17.360 --> 03:20.800
minimum wage, at least where I am. I think it's reasonable to say, not

03:20.800 --> 03:24.800
simply because of my example, but just in general, that Canada's welfare state

03:24.800 --> 03:28.320
system is a bit stronger than the UK's. Make all the jokes you want about

03:28.320 --> 03:31.920
Canadian healthcare, for example, but my sister would be dead without it. Her

03:31.920 --> 03:35.280
birth defect was something my family simply wouldn't have been able to fix if

03:35.280 --> 03:38.560
we were living in the US. But let's talk about the stereotype of the welfare

03:38.560 --> 03:42.640
queen. The welfare queen is somebody who refuses to work or works just long

03:42.640 --> 03:46.000
enough only to renew their benefits status, and purposefully stays

03:46.000 --> 03:49.200
unemployed to take advantage of the system. While I'm sure people like this

03:49.200 --> 03:52.480
exist, I don't think they exist to the extent that American and British

03:52.480 --> 03:56.080
conservatives think they exist. Simply because in those two countries, it's

03:56.080 --> 04:00.400
almost impossible to live on the minimum wage, let alone on unemployment insurance.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.560
But what about Canada? Well, up here, we have what's known as employment

04:04.560 --> 04:08.800
insurance, or EI. On the Canadian government's website, the amount of EI

04:08.800 --> 04:13.280
any one individual receives is stated to be 55% of your average weekly

04:13.280 --> 04:19.360
earnings from back when you had a job up to a maximum of $49,500 a year, or

04:19.360 --> 04:25.520
$524 a week. Keep in mind that most people won't actually be earning $524 a

04:25.520 --> 04:29.440
week on EI. In order to actually do so, a person would have had to have made

04:29.440 --> 04:33.920
around $100,000 a year when they lost their job. For example, if I lost my

04:33.920 --> 04:38.000
current job and went on EI, I would probably get around $100 a week, maybe a

04:38.000 --> 04:42.720
little bit more. EI lasts for between 14 to 45 weeks, and that length of time is

04:42.720 --> 04:46.160
dependent on multiple factors, including rate of employment for your riding, and

04:46.160 --> 04:49.440
the number of hours you work before losing your job. To put this in practical

04:49.440 --> 04:52.800
terms, based on the ballpark figures I gave about my own life earlier in this

04:52.800 --> 04:56.960
video, if I went on EI, I might have enough money to stay in my current place

04:56.960 --> 05:00.640
and eat the same quality of food, for the most part, but everything else would go.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.640
The social stuff, the frivolous purchases, the birthday or Christmas contributions,

05:04.640 --> 05:08.240
and so on. I would have the same basic quality of life, but I would lose

05:08.240 --> 05:12.400
virtually every single trimming, and even then it's really a 50-50 split on whether

05:12.400 --> 05:15.760
or not I'd be able to make ends meet at the end of the month. However, if I lived

05:15.760 --> 05:19.200
in the absolute cheapest, scummiest location in the city, and ate the cheapest,

05:19.200 --> 05:23.360
most unhealthy food imaginable, I'd have to tighten my belt a bit, but I'd be more

05:23.360 --> 05:27.120
or less fine. So, it may be slightly more feasible for people to exploit the

05:27.120 --> 05:30.000
system here in Canada, but that comes with the trade-off of having a stronger

05:30.000 --> 05:33.840
system all around. In regards to any given nation's social safety net, there

05:33.840 --> 05:36.960
seems to be a loose correlation between the strength of the system and the

05:36.960 --> 05:40.320
amount the system is exploited by the population. If you cannot live on the

05:40.320 --> 05:43.200
minimum wage in a given nation, you're certainly not going to be able to live

05:43.200 --> 05:47.280
on the vastly inferior sum that is unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, in a

05:47.280 --> 05:50.080
nation with a very strong safety net, you're also going to see a number of

05:50.080 --> 05:53.360
other benefits with it. A higher minimum wage, a greater ability for a worker to

05:53.360 --> 05:56.880
re-enter the workforce after sickness, injury, or a spell of unemployment, and

05:56.880 --> 06:01.200
yes, more exploitation of the system. The judgment must be made. Is it preferable

06:01.200 --> 06:04.880
to have a stronger system where people who need help get it but exploitation is

06:04.880 --> 06:08.000
more common, or a weaker system where deserving people get less help but

06:08.000 --> 06:11.200
exploitation is less common? In order to answer that, we need to recognize that

06:11.200 --> 06:15.920
while humans use money as their primary currencies, society in fact does not. The

06:15.920 --> 06:19.200
best way to explain this phenomenon is to reveal myself as the true video game

06:19.200 --> 06:22.880
nerd that I am and talk about the Civilization series for a second. In

06:22.880 --> 06:27.520
Civilization, your nation operates on three primary currencies, food, gold, and

06:27.520 --> 06:30.960
hammers. Food is fairly straightforward. It keeps your population fed and allows

06:30.960 --> 06:34.320
your cities to grow. Gold is money. You use it to pay for your maintenance costs

06:34.320 --> 06:37.760
and buildings and units. Hammers are a measurement of how much labor your

06:37.760 --> 06:41.680
citizens actually perform. It's more abstract than food or gold, but things

06:41.680 --> 06:46.400
like workshops, water mills, lumber mills, and mines all produce hammers. A city

06:46.400 --> 06:49.840
with an abundance of hammers can build new buildings and train new units more

06:49.840 --> 06:54.240
quickly. I know Civ is a video game, but it is an accurate, if not very simplistic

06:54.240 --> 06:59.520
view of society. If we look at the work that you or I or anybody else produces

06:59.520 --> 07:04.480
at our day jobs as a tangible, tradable currency may be represented by hammers,

07:04.480 --> 07:08.480
it becomes significantly more clear why a strong welfare state is a net good for

07:08.480 --> 07:12.640
society. In essence, humans desire gold and have an excess number of hammers for

07:12.640 --> 07:16.800
trade, while society desires hammers and has an excess amount of gold for trade.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.400
And this exchange of gold for hammers is called the economy. If this sounds

07:20.400 --> 07:23.760
familiar to you, it should. Karl Marx wrote about the nature of

07:23.760 --> 07:27.280
production as a tradable currency in its own right in the Communist Manifesto.

07:27.280 --> 07:31.120
And any educated capitalist will tell you that Karl Marx was correct when he

07:31.120 --> 07:34.640
described the relationship between the worker and society. They just don't like

07:34.640 --> 07:38.480
the conclusions he came to. Anyway, society values hammers over gold. It

07:38.480 --> 07:42.240
wants people to work, to produce goods and services, and it is willing to trade

07:42.240 --> 07:45.760
money to incentivize people to do so. Therefore, when a person is unable to

07:45.760 --> 07:49.440
work, it's in society's best interest to try and get that person back to work as

07:49.440 --> 07:52.960
quickly as possible. It's not just a moral imperative to ensure that people

07:52.960 --> 07:56.720
don't simply die when they hit a rut of bad luck, but also the production that a

07:56.720 --> 08:00.480
worker provides society with very quickly pays for the money society gives

08:00.480 --> 08:03.440
to a worker through the social safety net when a worker finds themselves

08:03.440 --> 08:06.240
unable to work. Another good way to look at the issue is through the eyes of an

08:06.240 --> 08:11.120
investor. Society can invest, say, $10,000 into a worker and get another 20 years

08:11.120 --> 08:15.120
of production from them, or society can save $10,000 and lose 20 years of

08:15.120 --> 08:18.880
production. The big criticism towards a society that functions in this way is

08:18.880 --> 08:21.920
that there's always going to be people who try and find ways to exploit the

08:21.920 --> 08:25.040
system to do as little work as possible in order to qualify for the next round

08:25.040 --> 08:28.880
of benefits or, where possible, simply not work at all. And even though the math

08:28.880 --> 08:32.480
shows that this is almost impossible to achieve, let's take the criticism at face

08:32.480 --> 08:36.560
value and assume that welfare queens are, in fact, a sizable problem. In the

08:36.560 --> 08:40.720
investor example, society invested $10,000 to help a worker when that worker

08:40.720 --> 08:43.920
couldn't find a job and got 20 years of production in return when that worker

08:43.920 --> 08:47.440
finally did find a job. What if it takes three rounds of investment from society

08:47.440 --> 08:50.560
in order to get a worker back to work instead of just one? What if it takes

08:50.560 --> 08:55.120
five? Ten. At what point does it simply become not worth it to continue

08:55.120 --> 08:58.480
investing in a worker that cannot offer return in the investment in the form of

08:58.480 --> 09:02.080
production? I don't know. A moralist would say that we should never reach that

09:02.080 --> 09:04.960
point, that our society is prosperous enough that we should be able to

09:04.960 --> 09:08.560
indefinitely support a citizen that can't find work for their entire lives.

09:08.560 --> 09:12.080
But if you ever wanted to open the door wide to potential abuse of the system,

09:12.080 --> 09:15.600
that seems like the way to do it. At the same time, there is likely a turning

09:15.600 --> 09:18.560
point where the cost of investing in a worker that cannot find work becomes too

09:18.560 --> 09:21.840
high, where you pay so much to get them back on their feet that the amount of

09:21.840 --> 09:24.640
production they provide will never make up for the money spent. I don't know

09:24.640 --> 09:28.000
where that turning point is, but what do we do with citizens that cross that

09:28.000 --> 09:31.680
point? Do we simply cut them free and let them die? That doesn't seem like an

09:31.680 --> 09:35.040
acceptable solution either. I don't even know if it's a feasible solution because

09:35.040 --> 09:38.000
it's very hard to predict whether or not a worker is going to begin producing

09:38.000 --> 09:41.040
again before we make the investment into them. There are some people who believe

09:41.040 --> 09:44.400
that cutting benefits to the working class is a good way to responsibly save

09:44.400 --> 09:47.920
taxpayer money, and it might put a small dent in the nation's debt in the short

09:47.920 --> 09:51.280
term, but the long-term impact will be the nation chopping itself off at the

09:51.280 --> 09:54.560
knees. If a society that relies on production from its citizens would rather

09:54.560 --> 09:57.920
hold on to money instead of trade it, it will end up gutting its own workforce in

09:57.920 --> 10:01.600
exchange for some tiny amount of financial savings. This is personally my

10:01.600 --> 10:05.200
biggest problem with libertarianism as a political philosophy. I think I'll do a

10:05.200 --> 10:08.640
more in-depth video on the subject of libertarians in the future, but for now

10:08.640 --> 10:12.800
this will have to do. A core tenant of libertarianism is privatization, meaning

10:12.800 --> 10:15.920
services provided by the state should be provided by the economy, and the free

10:15.920 --> 10:19.120
marketplace will naturally self-regulate as customers choose the best

10:19.120 --> 10:22.640
quality goods and services, allowing the lesser quality to be weeded out via a

10:22.640 --> 10:25.920
lack of business. It's cutthroat and Darwinian to be sure, but there's a

10:25.920 --> 10:29.600
certain appeal to the idea, especially if you're the person currently on top.

10:29.600 --> 10:33.680
Competition, after all, does breed innovation, but a libertarian society is

10:33.680 --> 10:38.240
also very easily exploited. What if the largest provider of any good or service

10:38.240 --> 10:42.240
is actually hideously subpar, even dangerous to the consumer, but because of

10:42.240 --> 10:45.600
their monopoly and a lack of government regulation, they are able to push any

10:45.600 --> 10:49.360
competitors out of the marketplace, even the quality ones, and control the media

10:49.360 --> 10:51.920
message so that the knowledge of these competitors never even reaches the

10:51.920 --> 10:55.280
consumer base. If this sounds ridiculous to you, then you're probably somebody who

10:55.280 --> 10:58.000
doesn't remember what the world was like before the internet arrived and did a

10:58.000 --> 11:01.120
lot to equalize the power of speech, because what I just described was

11:01.120 --> 11:04.640
commonplace before consumers had the ability to congregate online and offer

11:04.640 --> 11:08.480
their opinions counter to any approved narrative. Somebody within the ideal

11:08.480 --> 11:12.000
libertarian marketplace would have to live by a very specific code in order to

11:12.080 --> 11:16.800
thrive, and that code isn't without merit. Work hard, extremely hard, harder than the

11:16.800 --> 11:19.760
other guy, because if you don't secure your cut of the pie, they're going to

11:19.760 --> 11:24.080
take it from you. Competition above all else, and to the victor go the spoils. I

11:24.080 --> 11:28.800
say this with no exaggeration or sarcasm. That value system is a good way to order

11:28.800 --> 11:32.240
your life on a personal level. You can never have too much work ethic, and it's

11:32.240 --> 11:35.520
always good to push yourself beyond comfortable plateaus and into new areas

11:35.520 --> 11:39.120
of self-improvement, and that applies to your job, your health, your relationships,

11:39.120 --> 11:43.040
your goals and dreams, your schooling, whatever. Tenacity is a quality that can

11:43.040 --> 11:47.040
overcome almost any other obstacle. However, as a philosophy for running an

11:47.040 --> 11:51.760
entire society, pure libertarianism seems to be self-destructive. You can't run a

11:51.760 --> 11:55.840
nation solely on the principle of may the best man win without laying a lot of

11:55.840 --> 11:59.600
dead bodies down as the foundation. When everyone fends for themselves, that means

11:59.600 --> 12:03.360
public schooling is gone, public health care is gone, police and fire services

12:03.360 --> 12:06.480
are gone, unemployment insurance is gone. There's a lot of libertarians who

12:06.480 --> 12:09.680
consider that to be a straw man, but I don't think it is. If the rich pay for

12:09.680 --> 12:13.440
their kids to go to school, or the hospital, and the poor cannot pay, that

12:13.440 --> 12:17.120
leads to a strictly defined class system, multi-generational poverty, and an

12:17.120 --> 12:20.480
unending nightmare for most of the human population. And I think this speaks to a

12:20.480 --> 12:23.760
much larger point, that effective personal solutions are not always going

12:23.760 --> 12:27.760
to translate to being effective social solutions. Personal libertarianism can be

12:27.760 --> 12:31.360
admirable as a framework through which you order your life. You value hard work,

12:31.360 --> 12:34.560
you understand the nature of competition, and you never ever give up because what

12:34.560 --> 12:37.920
you want is more important than the obstacles you face. You temper yourself

12:37.920 --> 12:42.080
through hardship, but this philosophy applied society-wide leads to widespread

12:42.080 --> 12:45.680
death and a return to the dark ages. There are other examples of personal

12:45.680 --> 12:49.040
solutions not working as social solutions, some of which I intend to make

12:49.040 --> 12:53.440
future videos on. Safe spaces, as defined by social justice, fall into this

12:53.440 --> 12:57.760
category. Another simpler example of this rule of thumb is diet. Those of you who

12:57.760 --> 13:00.560
have watched the other videos on this channel know that I'm a fatty. I'm

13:00.560 --> 13:03.760
currently on a ketosis diet where you eat little to no carbs, that means

13:03.760 --> 13:08.400
cutting out corn, bread, pasta, potatoes, and rice. It's a very effective personal

13:08.400 --> 13:13.280
solution. However, I wouldn't advocate this as a universal solution. Rice, wheat,

13:13.280 --> 13:17.360
and corn are the three biggest food staples in the world, easy to grow, cheap

13:17.360 --> 13:20.960
at the marketplace. If everybody stopped eating these sources of cheap calories,

13:20.960 --> 13:24.160
millions would starve and the food industry would collapse because we simply

13:24.160 --> 13:27.600
don't have the capability to replace those staples on our farms with other

13:27.600 --> 13:31.360
foods at the rate that 7.4 billion people would require. Enough about food

13:31.360 --> 13:34.240
though. When somebody talks about the working poor as if they're simply lazy

13:34.240 --> 13:36.880
and spending all their money on junk without saving it and trying to better

13:36.880 --> 13:39.760
themselves, like this fellow on one of Sargon's videos saying,

13:39.760 --> 13:43.440
as to minimum wage, if you're stupid and irresponsible, then you will not save a

13:43.440 --> 13:48.160
penny. If you have that kind of job and want kids, big house, new TV, etc., it's

13:48.160 --> 13:51.840
your selfish choices, not survival. I think their core lack of understanding

13:51.840 --> 13:55.120
comes from not knowing that personal solutions do not function as social

13:55.120 --> 13:59.200
solutions. When the libertarian social solution is to dismantle a safety net, to

13:59.200 --> 14:02.320
remove the ability of a worker to get back on their feet and contribute again

14:02.320 --> 14:05.760
and improve their standing again, all in the name of allowing the best to rise to

14:05.760 --> 14:09.120
the top and letting the rest sink to the bottom, the libertarian personal

14:09.120 --> 14:13.200
solutions of tenacity and work ethic will not help a worker who has no chance

14:13.200 --> 14:16.400
of ever recovering from the poverty that sickness or injury will leave them in.

14:16.400 --> 14:20.800
Society needs all workers contributing production, not just the best, but the

14:20.800 --> 14:24.480
best and everybody else. And the libertarian philosophy of rewarding the

14:24.480 --> 14:27.280
best and abandoning everybody else just isn't going to cut it.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.000
Hey guys, I hope you enjoyed the first SF opinions. I would like to do more of

14:32.000 --> 14:35.920
these in the future and I do have some topic ideas, so if you guys think this is

14:35.920 --> 14:39.360
a series worth continuing, please let me know in the comments. And if there's

14:39.360 --> 14:42.240
something you'd like me to chat about for a while, let me know about that too.

14:42.240 --> 14:45.840
I'd like to try to do one of these twice a week, but it really just depends on how

14:45.840 --> 14:49.040
much interest there is. The next one I put out is either going to be on the

14:49.040 --> 14:54.320
nature of pedophilia in the light of Sarah Butts, or alternatively the state of

14:54.400 --> 14:57.600
World of Warcraft as we go into the next expansion. I hope you enjoyed this sort

14:57.600 --> 14:59.680
of thing though, and make sure to come back and check it out.
