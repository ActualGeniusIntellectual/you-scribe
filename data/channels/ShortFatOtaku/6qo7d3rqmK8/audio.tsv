0	3760	This video serves partially as a reply to Sargon of Akkad's video,
3760	6960	The False Narrative of the Working Poor, and also to a lesser extent,
6960	10080	the video from which it sprang, what the Conservative Party did next.
10080	13200	However I also have some other related topics to throw in as well. I do
13200	15920	recommend you go back and watch those videos if you haven't already because
15920	18080	they're quite good. But for those of you who don't know,
18080	21840	in The False Narrative of the Working Poor, Sargon outlines exactly how much
21840	25680	somebody would make in the UK with a minimum wage paying job working 40 hours
25680	28400	a week, and then subtracts various expenses from
28400	32160	that sum in order to discover the total amount one would have left over,
32160	36000	in order to dispute the idea that the working poor are just lazy bums taking
36000	38320	benefits. Now I don't have any concrete numbers
38320	42240	like Sargon did, but let me tell you about my status as one of Canada's
42240	45760	working poor. I understand that this example is going to be quite subjective,
45760	49680	but I still think there's some truth to it. At the very least it's realistic and
49680	52960	possible to live this way, considering that I'm actually doing it. I
52960	55760	live in a decent-sized urban centre in Canada.
55760	59200	Not one of the big three of Vancouver, Montreal, or the GTA,
59200	62640	where upper-class hipsters have gentrified large portions of the city,
62640	66640	driving up prices massively, similar to America's own Trust Fund
66640	69520	Baby Centres of Southern California and the Northwest Corridor.
69520	73520	But the city in which I live is still a medium-sized city. It's still considered
73520	77760	a regional centre for industry, culture, education, and healthcare. I live in a
77760	82400	middle-class area of the city. Older houses, lots of rentals, lots of
82400	86480	students, not much in the way of crime, no big lakeside mansions, but also not a
86480	90560	ghetto. Here's a bit of math off the top of my head. To live here I pay $400 a
90560	94880	month, including water and hydro. Internet comes out to $35 a month,
94880	99680	and I budget my food at around $25 a week. Again, I'm not eating
99680	102560	gourmet food, but I'm also not eating poorly. It's
102560	107440	nutritious, if not boring, fair. The minimum wage right now is $11.25 an
107440	110800	hour, and I get an average of 20 hours a week at my boring,
110800	114720	soul-crushing grocery store job. Taking out things like union fees and Canada
114720	119040	pension, I can expect to make around $200 a week and $800 a month.
119040	123600	Depending on various factors, I've seen that go as low as $600 a month and as
123600	129600	high as $1200. On an average $800 a month, rent consumes $400 of that money,
129600	135680	food takes another $100, and internet takes $35. That leaves $365 to handle
135680	139200	other expenses. I don't have a phone, I don't find myself needing much in the
139200	142640	way of new clothing or shoes, I don't pay for a city bus pass because I ride
142640	146240	my bicycle everywhere I go. Yes, including during the winter. Learning
146240	149760	how to winter bike ultimately became a godsend when it comes to transportation
149760	152640	around the city. Nonetheless, I don't save much of my
152640	155840	extra money. I usually end up putting the money into some of my hobbies or
155840	159600	passions, or picking up something for the YouTube channel like games or anime or
159600	163120	equipment or props, or sometimes we'll need something new for the house like
163120	165600	kitchen supplies or toiletries or whatever.
165600	170160	And yes, once in a while I'll spend on a social event or a gift or eat out with
170160	173680	friends or order a pizza for a movie night or something. I don't come out of
173680	177360	the month with much in the way of saved money, but I live a pretty comfortable
177360	181760	average working class bachelor existence. Somebody living where I am, who is
181760	186000	working a full 40 hours a week, full time, even at minimum wage, would find
186000	188960	themselves in a position to save up enough to purchase a vehicle in just a
188960	193200	couple of years. Yes, it would require them living a Spartan life for a period
193200	197360	of time, but it's not impossible. Upward mobility is possible even on
197360	200800	minimum wage, at least where I am. I think it's reasonable to say, not
200800	204800	simply because of my example, but just in general, that Canada's welfare state
204800	208320	system is a bit stronger than the UK's. Make all the jokes you want about
208320	211920	Canadian healthcare, for example, but my sister would be dead without it. Her
211920	215280	birth defect was something my family simply wouldn't have been able to fix if
215280	218560	we were living in the US. But let's talk about the stereotype of the welfare
218560	222640	queen. The welfare queen is somebody who refuses to work or works just long
222640	226000	enough only to renew their benefits status, and purposefully stays
226000	229200	unemployed to take advantage of the system. While I'm sure people like this
229200	232480	exist, I don't think they exist to the extent that American and British
232480	236080	conservatives think they exist. Simply because in those two countries, it's
236080	240400	almost impossible to live on the minimum wage, let alone on unemployment insurance.
240400	244560	But what about Canada? Well, up here, we have what's known as employment
244560	248800	insurance, or EI. On the Canadian government's website, the amount of EI
248800	253280	any one individual receives is stated to be 55% of your average weekly
253280	259360	earnings from back when you had a job up to a maximum of $49,500 a year, or
259360	265520	$524 a week. Keep in mind that most people won't actually be earning $524 a
265520	269440	week on EI. In order to actually do so, a person would have had to have made
269440	273920	around $100,000 a year when they lost their job. For example, if I lost my
273920	278000	current job and went on EI, I would probably get around $100 a week, maybe a
278000	282720	little bit more. EI lasts for between 14 to 45 weeks, and that length of time is
282720	286160	dependent on multiple factors, including rate of employment for your riding, and
286160	289440	the number of hours you work before losing your job. To put this in practical
289440	292800	terms, based on the ballpark figures I gave about my own life earlier in this
292800	296960	video, if I went on EI, I might have enough money to stay in my current place
296960	300640	and eat the same quality of food, for the most part, but everything else would go.
300640	304640	The social stuff, the frivolous purchases, the birthday or Christmas contributions,
304640	308240	and so on. I would have the same basic quality of life, but I would lose
308240	312400	virtually every single trimming, and even then it's really a 50-50 split on whether
312400	315760	or not I'd be able to make ends meet at the end of the month. However, if I lived
315760	319200	in the absolute cheapest, scummiest location in the city, and ate the cheapest,
319200	323360	most unhealthy food imaginable, I'd have to tighten my belt a bit, but I'd be more
323360	327120	or less fine. So, it may be slightly more feasible for people to exploit the
327120	330000	system here in Canada, but that comes with the trade-off of having a stronger
330000	333840	system all around. In regards to any given nation's social safety net, there
333840	336960	seems to be a loose correlation between the strength of the system and the
336960	340320	amount the system is exploited by the population. If you cannot live on the
340320	343200	minimum wage in a given nation, you're certainly not going to be able to live
343200	347280	on the vastly inferior sum that is unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, in a
347280	350080	nation with a very strong safety net, you're also going to see a number of
350080	353360	other benefits with it. A higher minimum wage, a greater ability for a worker to
353360	356880	re-enter the workforce after sickness, injury, or a spell of unemployment, and
356880	361200	yes, more exploitation of the system. The judgment must be made. Is it preferable
361200	364880	to have a stronger system where people who need help get it but exploitation is
364880	368000	more common, or a weaker system where deserving people get less help but
368000	371200	exploitation is less common? In order to answer that, we need to recognize that
371200	375920	while humans use money as their primary currencies, society in fact does not. The
375920	379200	best way to explain this phenomenon is to reveal myself as the true video game
379200	382880	nerd that I am and talk about the Civilization series for a second. In
382880	387520	Civilization, your nation operates on three primary currencies, food, gold, and
387520	390960	hammers. Food is fairly straightforward. It keeps your population fed and allows
390960	394320	your cities to grow. Gold is money. You use it to pay for your maintenance costs
394320	397760	and buildings and units. Hammers are a measurement of how much labor your
397760	401680	citizens actually perform. It's more abstract than food or gold, but things
401680	406400	like workshops, water mills, lumber mills, and mines all produce hammers. A city
406400	409840	with an abundance of hammers can build new buildings and train new units more
409840	414240	quickly. I know Civ is a video game, but it is an accurate, if not very simplistic
414240	419520	view of society. If we look at the work that you or I or anybody else produces
419520	424480	at our day jobs as a tangible, tradable currency may be represented by hammers,
424480	428480	it becomes significantly more clear why a strong welfare state is a net good for
428480	432640	society. In essence, humans desire gold and have an excess number of hammers for
432640	436800	trade, while society desires hammers and has an excess amount of gold for trade.
436800	440400	And this exchange of gold for hammers is called the economy. If this sounds
440400	443760	familiar to you, it should. Karl Marx wrote about the nature of
443760	447280	production as a tradable currency in its own right in the Communist Manifesto.
447280	451120	And any educated capitalist will tell you that Karl Marx was correct when he
451120	454640	described the relationship between the worker and society. They just don't like
454640	458480	the conclusions he came to. Anyway, society values hammers over gold. It
458480	462240	wants people to work, to produce goods and services, and it is willing to trade
462240	465760	money to incentivize people to do so. Therefore, when a person is unable to
465760	469440	work, it's in society's best interest to try and get that person back to work as
469440	472960	quickly as possible. It's not just a moral imperative to ensure that people
472960	476720	don't simply die when they hit a rut of bad luck, but also the production that a
476720	480480	worker provides society with very quickly pays for the money society gives
480480	483440	to a worker through the social safety net when a worker finds themselves
483440	486240	unable to work. Another good way to look at the issue is through the eyes of an
486240	491120	investor. Society can invest, say, $10,000 into a worker and get another 20 years
491120	495120	of production from them, or society can save $10,000 and lose 20 years of
495120	498880	production. The big criticism towards a society that functions in this way is
498880	501920	that there's always going to be people who try and find ways to exploit the
501920	505040	system to do as little work as possible in order to qualify for the next round
505040	508880	of benefits or, where possible, simply not work at all. And even though the math
508880	512480	shows that this is almost impossible to achieve, let's take the criticism at face
512480	516560	value and assume that welfare queens are, in fact, a sizable problem. In the
516560	520720	investor example, society invested $10,000 to help a worker when that worker
520720	523920	couldn't find a job and got 20 years of production in return when that worker
523920	527440	finally did find a job. What if it takes three rounds of investment from society
527440	530560	in order to get a worker back to work instead of just one? What if it takes
530560	535120	five? Ten. At what point does it simply become not worth it to continue
535120	538480	investing in a worker that cannot offer return in the investment in the form of
538480	542080	production? I don't know. A moralist would say that we should never reach that
542080	544960	point, that our society is prosperous enough that we should be able to
544960	548560	indefinitely support a citizen that can't find work for their entire lives.
548560	552080	But if you ever wanted to open the door wide to potential abuse of the system,
552080	555600	that seems like the way to do it. At the same time, there is likely a turning
555600	558560	point where the cost of investing in a worker that cannot find work becomes too
558560	561840	high, where you pay so much to get them back on their feet that the amount of
561840	564640	production they provide will never make up for the money spent. I don't know
564640	568000	where that turning point is, but what do we do with citizens that cross that
568000	571680	point? Do we simply cut them free and let them die? That doesn't seem like an
571680	575040	acceptable solution either. I don't even know if it's a feasible solution because
575040	578000	it's very hard to predict whether or not a worker is going to begin producing
578000	581040	again before we make the investment into them. There are some people who believe
581040	584400	that cutting benefits to the working class is a good way to responsibly save
584400	587920	taxpayer money, and it might put a small dent in the nation's debt in the short
587920	591280	term, but the long-term impact will be the nation chopping itself off at the
591280	594560	knees. If a society that relies on production from its citizens would rather
594560	597920	hold on to money instead of trade it, it will end up gutting its own workforce in
597920	601600	exchange for some tiny amount of financial savings. This is personally my
601600	605200	biggest problem with libertarianism as a political philosophy. I think I'll do a
605200	608640	more in-depth video on the subject of libertarians in the future, but for now
608640	612800	this will have to do. A core tenant of libertarianism is privatization, meaning
612800	615920	services provided by the state should be provided by the economy, and the free
615920	619120	marketplace will naturally self-regulate as customers choose the best
619120	622640	quality goods and services, allowing the lesser quality to be weeded out via a
622640	625920	lack of business. It's cutthroat and Darwinian to be sure, but there's a
625920	629600	certain appeal to the idea, especially if you're the person currently on top.
629600	633680	Competition, after all, does breed innovation, but a libertarian society is
633680	638240	also very easily exploited. What if the largest provider of any good or service
638240	642240	is actually hideously subpar, even dangerous to the consumer, but because of
642240	645600	their monopoly and a lack of government regulation, they are able to push any
645600	649360	competitors out of the marketplace, even the quality ones, and control the media
649360	651920	message so that the knowledge of these competitors never even reaches the
651920	655280	consumer base. If this sounds ridiculous to you, then you're probably somebody who
655280	658000	doesn't remember what the world was like before the internet arrived and did a
658000	661120	lot to equalize the power of speech, because what I just described was
661120	664640	commonplace before consumers had the ability to congregate online and offer
664640	668480	their opinions counter to any approved narrative. Somebody within the ideal
668480	672000	libertarian marketplace would have to live by a very specific code in order to
672080	676800	thrive, and that code isn't without merit. Work hard, extremely hard, harder than the
676800	679760	other guy, because if you don't secure your cut of the pie, they're going to
679760	684080	take it from you. Competition above all else, and to the victor go the spoils. I
684080	688800	say this with no exaggeration or sarcasm. That value system is a good way to order
688800	692240	your life on a personal level. You can never have too much work ethic, and it's
692240	695520	always good to push yourself beyond comfortable plateaus and into new areas
695520	699120	of self-improvement, and that applies to your job, your health, your relationships,
699120	703040	your goals and dreams, your schooling, whatever. Tenacity is a quality that can
703040	707040	overcome almost any other obstacle. However, as a philosophy for running an
707040	711760	entire society, pure libertarianism seems to be self-destructive. You can't run a
711760	715840	nation solely on the principle of may the best man win without laying a lot of
715840	719600	dead bodies down as the foundation. When everyone fends for themselves, that means
719600	723360	public schooling is gone, public health care is gone, police and fire services
723360	726480	are gone, unemployment insurance is gone. There's a lot of libertarians who
726480	729680	consider that to be a straw man, but I don't think it is. If the rich pay for
729680	733440	their kids to go to school, or the hospital, and the poor cannot pay, that
733440	737120	leads to a strictly defined class system, multi-generational poverty, and an
737120	740480	unending nightmare for most of the human population. And I think this speaks to a
740480	743760	much larger point, that effective personal solutions are not always going
743760	747760	to translate to being effective social solutions. Personal libertarianism can be
747760	751360	admirable as a framework through which you order your life. You value hard work,
751360	754560	you understand the nature of competition, and you never ever give up because what
754560	757920	you want is more important than the obstacles you face. You temper yourself
757920	762080	through hardship, but this philosophy applied society-wide leads to widespread
762080	765680	death and a return to the dark ages. There are other examples of personal
765680	769040	solutions not working as social solutions, some of which I intend to make
769040	773440	future videos on. Safe spaces, as defined by social justice, fall into this
773440	777760	category. Another simpler example of this rule of thumb is diet. Those of you who
777760	780560	have watched the other videos on this channel know that I'm a fatty. I'm
780560	783760	currently on a ketosis diet where you eat little to no carbs, that means
783760	788400	cutting out corn, bread, pasta, potatoes, and rice. It's a very effective personal
788400	793280	solution. However, I wouldn't advocate this as a universal solution. Rice, wheat,
793280	797360	and corn are the three biggest food staples in the world, easy to grow, cheap
797360	800960	at the marketplace. If everybody stopped eating these sources of cheap calories,
800960	804160	millions would starve and the food industry would collapse because we simply
804160	807600	don't have the capability to replace those staples on our farms with other
807600	811360	foods at the rate that 7.4 billion people would require. Enough about food
811360	814240	though. When somebody talks about the working poor as if they're simply lazy
814240	816880	and spending all their money on junk without saving it and trying to better
816880	819760	themselves, like this fellow on one of Sargon's videos saying,
819760	823440	as to minimum wage, if you're stupid and irresponsible, then you will not save a
823440	828160	penny. If you have that kind of job and want kids, big house, new TV, etc., it's
828160	831840	your selfish choices, not survival. I think their core lack of understanding
831840	835120	comes from not knowing that personal solutions do not function as social
835120	839200	solutions. When the libertarian social solution is to dismantle a safety net, to
839200	842320	remove the ability of a worker to get back on their feet and contribute again
842320	845760	and improve their standing again, all in the name of allowing the best to rise to
845760	849120	the top and letting the rest sink to the bottom, the libertarian personal
849120	853200	solutions of tenacity and work ethic will not help a worker who has no chance
853200	856400	of ever recovering from the poverty that sickness or injury will leave them in.
856400	860800	Society needs all workers contributing production, not just the best, but the
860800	864480	best and everybody else. And the libertarian philosophy of rewarding the
864480	867280	best and abandoning everybody else just isn't going to cut it.
868240	872000	Hey guys, I hope you enjoyed the first SF opinions. I would like to do more of
872000	875920	these in the future and I do have some topic ideas, so if you guys think this is
875920	879360	a series worth continuing, please let me know in the comments. And if there's
879360	882240	something you'd like me to chat about for a while, let me know about that too.
882240	885840	I'd like to try to do one of these twice a week, but it really just depends on how
885840	889040	much interest there is. The next one I put out is either going to be on the
889040	894320	nature of pedophilia in the light of Sarah Butts, or alternatively the state of
894400	897600	World of Warcraft as we go into the next expansion. I hope you enjoyed this sort
897600	899680	of thing though, and make sure to come back and check it out.
