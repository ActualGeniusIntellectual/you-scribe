00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
This video serves partially as a reply to Sargon of Akkad's video,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,960
The False Narrative of the Working Poor, and also to a lesser extent,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,080
the video from which it sprang, what the Conservative Party did next.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,200
However I also have some other related topics to throw in as well. I do

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,920
recommend you go back and watch those videos if you haven't already because

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,080
they're quite good. But for those of you who don't know,

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,840
in The False Narrative of the Working Poor, Sargon outlines exactly how much

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,680
somebody would make in the UK with a minimum wage paying job working 40 hours

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,400
a week, and then subtracts various expenses from

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,160
that sum in order to discover the total amount one would have left over,

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,000
in order to dispute the idea that the working poor are just lazy bums taking

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,320
benefits. Now I don't have any concrete numbers

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,240
like Sargon did, but let me tell you about my status as one of Canada's

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,760
working poor. I understand that this example is going to be quite subjective,

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,680
but I still think there's some truth to it. At the very least it's realistic and

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,960
possible to live this way, considering that I'm actually doing it. I

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,760
live in a decent-sized urban centre in Canada.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,200
Not one of the big three of Vancouver, Montreal, or the GTA,

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,640
where upper-class hipsters have gentrified large portions of the city,

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,640
driving up prices massively, similar to America's own Trust Fund

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,520
Baby Centres of Southern California and the Northwest Corridor.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,520
But the city in which I live is still a medium-sized city. It's still considered

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,760
a regional centre for industry, culture, education, and healthcare. I live in a

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,400
middle-class area of the city. Older houses, lots of rentals, lots of

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,480
students, not much in the way of crime, no big lakeside mansions, but also not a

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,560
ghetto. Here's a bit of math off the top of my head. To live here I pay $400 a

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,880
month, including water and hydro. Internet comes out to $35 a month,

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,680
and I budget my food at around $25 a week. Again, I'm not eating

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,560
gourmet food, but I'm also not eating poorly. It's

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,440
nutritious, if not boring, fair. The minimum wage right now is $11.25 an

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,800
hour, and I get an average of 20 hours a week at my boring,

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,720
soul-crushing grocery store job. Taking out things like union fees and Canada

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,040
pension, I can expect to make around $200 a week and $800 a month.

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,600
Depending on various factors, I've seen that go as low as $600 a month and as

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,600
high as $1200. On an average $800 a month, rent consumes $400 of that money,

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,680
food takes another $100, and internet takes $35. That leaves $365 to handle

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,200
other expenses. I don't have a phone, I don't find myself needing much in the

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,640
way of new clothing or shoes, I don't pay for a city bus pass because I ride

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,240
my bicycle everywhere I go. Yes, including during the winter. Learning

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,760
how to winter bike ultimately became a godsend when it comes to transportation

41
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,640
around the city. Nonetheless, I don't save much of my

42
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,840
extra money. I usually end up putting the money into some of my hobbies or

43
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,600
passions, or picking up something for the YouTube channel like games or anime or

44
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,120
equipment or props, or sometimes we'll need something new for the house like

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,600
kitchen supplies or toiletries or whatever.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,160
And yes, once in a while I'll spend on a social event or a gift or eat out with

47
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,680
friends or order a pizza for a movie night or something. I don't come out of

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,360
the month with much in the way of saved money, but I live a pretty comfortable

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,760
average working class bachelor existence. Somebody living where I am, who is

50
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,000
working a full 40 hours a week, full time, even at minimum wage, would find

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,960
themselves in a position to save up enough to purchase a vehicle in just a

52
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,200
couple of years. Yes, it would require them living a Spartan life for a period

53
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,360
of time, but it's not impossible. Upward mobility is possible even on

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,800
minimum wage, at least where I am. I think it's reasonable to say, not

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,800
simply because of my example, but just in general, that Canada's welfare state

56
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,320
system is a bit stronger than the UK's. Make all the jokes you want about

57
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,920
Canadian healthcare, for example, but my sister would be dead without it. Her

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,280
birth defect was something my family simply wouldn't have been able to fix if

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,560
we were living in the US. But let's talk about the stereotype of the welfare

60
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,640
queen. The welfare queen is somebody who refuses to work or works just long

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,000
enough only to renew their benefits status, and purposefully stays

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
unemployed to take advantage of the system. While I'm sure people like this

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,480
exist, I don't think they exist to the extent that American and British

64
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,080
conservatives think they exist. Simply because in those two countries, it's

65
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,400
almost impossible to live on the minimum wage, let alone on unemployment insurance.

66
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,560
But what about Canada? Well, up here, we have what's known as employment

67
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,800
insurance, or EI. On the Canadian government's website, the amount of EI

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,280
any one individual receives is stated to be 55% of your average weekly

69
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,360
earnings from back when you had a job up to a maximum of $49,500 a year, or

70
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,520
$524 a week. Keep in mind that most people won't actually be earning $524 a

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440
week on EI. In order to actually do so, a person would have had to have made

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,920
around $100,000 a year when they lost their job. For example, if I lost my

73
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,000
current job and went on EI, I would probably get around $100 a week, maybe a

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,720
little bit more. EI lasts for between 14 to 45 weeks, and that length of time is

75
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,160
dependent on multiple factors, including rate of employment for your riding, and

76
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,440
the number of hours you work before losing your job. To put this in practical

77
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,800
terms, based on the ballpark figures I gave about my own life earlier in this

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,960
video, if I went on EI, I might have enough money to stay in my current place

79
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,640
and eat the same quality of food, for the most part, but everything else would go.

80
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,640
The social stuff, the frivolous purchases, the birthday or Christmas contributions,

81
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,240
and so on. I would have the same basic quality of life, but I would lose

82
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,400
virtually every single trimming, and even then it's really a 50-50 split on whether

83
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,760
or not I'd be able to make ends meet at the end of the month. However, if I lived

84
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,200
in the absolute cheapest, scummiest location in the city, and ate the cheapest,

85
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,360
most unhealthy food imaginable, I'd have to tighten my belt a bit, but I'd be more

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,120
or less fine. So, it may be slightly more feasible for people to exploit the

87
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
system here in Canada, but that comes with the trade-off of having a stronger

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,840
system all around. In regards to any given nation's social safety net, there

89
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,960
seems to be a loose correlation between the strength of the system and the

90
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,320
amount the system is exploited by the population. If you cannot live on the

91
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,200
minimum wage in a given nation, you're certainly not going to be able to live

92
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,280
on the vastly inferior sum that is unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, in a

93
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,080
nation with a very strong safety net, you're also going to see a number of

94
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,360
other benefits with it. A higher minimum wage, a greater ability for a worker to

95
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,880
re-enter the workforce after sickness, injury, or a spell of unemployment, and

96
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,200
yes, more exploitation of the system. The judgment must be made. Is it preferable

97
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,880
to have a stronger system where people who need help get it but exploitation is

98
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,000
more common, or a weaker system where deserving people get less help but

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,200
exploitation is less common? In order to answer that, we need to recognize that

100
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,920
while humans use money as their primary currencies, society in fact does not. The

101
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,200
best way to explain this phenomenon is to reveal myself as the true video game

102
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,880
nerd that I am and talk about the Civilization series for a second. In

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,520
Civilization, your nation operates on three primary currencies, food, gold, and

104
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,960
hammers. Food is fairly straightforward. It keeps your population fed and allows

105
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,320
your cities to grow. Gold is money. You use it to pay for your maintenance costs

106
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,760
and buildings and units. Hammers are a measurement of how much labor your

107
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,680
citizens actually perform. It's more abstract than food or gold, but things

108
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,400
like workshops, water mills, lumber mills, and mines all produce hammers. A city

109
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,840
with an abundance of hammers can build new buildings and train new units more

110
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,240
quickly. I know Civ is a video game, but it is an accurate, if not very simplistic

111
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,520
view of society. If we look at the work that you or I or anybody else produces

112
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,480
at our day jobs as a tangible, tradable currency may be represented by hammers,

113
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,480
it becomes significantly more clear why a strong welfare state is a net good for

114
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,640
society. In essence, humans desire gold and have an excess number of hammers for

115
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,800
trade, while society desires hammers and has an excess amount of gold for trade.

116
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
And this exchange of gold for hammers is called the economy. If this sounds

117
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,760
familiar to you, it should. Karl Marx wrote about the nature of

118
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,280
production as a tradable currency in its own right in the Communist Manifesto.

119
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,120
And any educated capitalist will tell you that Karl Marx was correct when he

120
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,640
described the relationship between the worker and society. They just don't like

121
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,480
the conclusions he came to. Anyway, society values hammers over gold. It

122
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,240
wants people to work, to produce goods and services, and it is willing to trade

123
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,760
money to incentivize people to do so. Therefore, when a person is unable to

124
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,440
work, it's in society's best interest to try and get that person back to work as

125
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,960
quickly as possible. It's not just a moral imperative to ensure that people

126
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,720
don't simply die when they hit a rut of bad luck, but also the production that a

127
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,480
worker provides society with very quickly pays for the money society gives

128
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,440
to a worker through the social safety net when a worker finds themselves

129
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,240
unable to work. Another good way to look at the issue is through the eyes of an

130
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,120
investor. Society can invest, say, $10,000 into a worker and get another 20 years

131
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,120
of production from them, or society can save $10,000 and lose 20 years of

132
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,880
production. The big criticism towards a society that functions in this way is

133
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,920
that there's always going to be people who try and find ways to exploit the

134
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,040
system to do as little work as possible in order to qualify for the next round

135
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,880
of benefits or, where possible, simply not work at all. And even though the math

136
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,480
shows that this is almost impossible to achieve, let's take the criticism at face

137
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,560
value and assume that welfare queens are, in fact, a sizable problem. In the

138
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,720
investor example, society invested $10,000 to help a worker when that worker

139
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,920
couldn't find a job and got 20 years of production in return when that worker

140
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,440
finally did find a job. What if it takes three rounds of investment from society

141
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,560
in order to get a worker back to work instead of just one? What if it takes

142
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,120
five? Ten. At what point does it simply become not worth it to continue

143
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,480
investing in a worker that cannot offer return in the investment in the form of

144
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,080
production? I don't know. A moralist would say that we should never reach that

145
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,960
point, that our society is prosperous enough that we should be able to

146
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,560
indefinitely support a citizen that can't find work for their entire lives.

147
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,080
But if you ever wanted to open the door wide to potential abuse of the system,

148
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,600
that seems like the way to do it. At the same time, there is likely a turning

149
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,560
point where the cost of investing in a worker that cannot find work becomes too

150
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,840
high, where you pay so much to get them back on their feet that the amount of

151
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,640
production they provide will never make up for the money spent. I don't know

152
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,000
where that turning point is, but what do we do with citizens that cross that

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,680
point? Do we simply cut them free and let them die? That doesn't seem like an

154
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,040
acceptable solution either. I don't even know if it's a feasible solution because

155
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,000
it's very hard to predict whether or not a worker is going to begin producing

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,040
again before we make the investment into them. There are some people who believe

157
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,400
that cutting benefits to the working class is a good way to responsibly save

158
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,920
taxpayer money, and it might put a small dent in the nation's debt in the short

159
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,280
term, but the long-term impact will be the nation chopping itself off at the

160
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,560
knees. If a society that relies on production from its citizens would rather

161
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,920
hold on to money instead of trade it, it will end up gutting its own workforce in

162
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,600
exchange for some tiny amount of financial savings. This is personally my

163
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
biggest problem with libertarianism as a political philosophy. I think I'll do a

164
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,640
more in-depth video on the subject of libertarians in the future, but for now

165
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,800
this will have to do. A core tenant of libertarianism is privatization, meaning

166
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,920
services provided by the state should be provided by the economy, and the free

167
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,120
marketplace will naturally self-regulate as customers choose the best

168
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,640
quality goods and services, allowing the lesser quality to be weeded out via a

169
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
lack of business. It's cutthroat and Darwinian to be sure, but there's a

170
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,600
certain appeal to the idea, especially if you're the person currently on top.

171
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,680
Competition, after all, does breed innovation, but a libertarian society is

172
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,240
also very easily exploited. What if the largest provider of any good or service

173
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,240
is actually hideously subpar, even dangerous to the consumer, but because of

174
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,600
their monopoly and a lack of government regulation, they are able to push any

175
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,360
competitors out of the marketplace, even the quality ones, and control the media

176
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,920
message so that the knowledge of these competitors never even reaches the

177
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,280
consumer base. If this sounds ridiculous to you, then you're probably somebody who

178
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,000
doesn't remember what the world was like before the internet arrived and did a

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,120
lot to equalize the power of speech, because what I just described was

180
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,640
commonplace before consumers had the ability to congregate online and offer

181
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,480
their opinions counter to any approved narrative. Somebody within the ideal

182
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,000
libertarian marketplace would have to live by a very specific code in order to

183
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,800
thrive, and that code isn't without merit. Work hard, extremely hard, harder than the

184
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,760
other guy, because if you don't secure your cut of the pie, they're going to

185
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,080
take it from you. Competition above all else, and to the victor go the spoils. I

186
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,800
say this with no exaggeration or sarcasm. That value system is a good way to order

187
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,240
your life on a personal level. You can never have too much work ethic, and it's

188
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,520
always good to push yourself beyond comfortable plateaus and into new areas

189
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,120
of self-improvement, and that applies to your job, your health, your relationships,

190
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,040
your goals and dreams, your schooling, whatever. Tenacity is a quality that can

191
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,040
overcome almost any other obstacle. However, as a philosophy for running an

192
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,760
entire society, pure libertarianism seems to be self-destructive. You can't run a

193
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,840
nation solely on the principle of may the best man win without laying a lot of

194
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,600
dead bodies down as the foundation. When everyone fends for themselves, that means

195
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,360
public schooling is gone, public health care is gone, police and fire services

196
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,480
are gone, unemployment insurance is gone. There's a lot of libertarians who

197
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,680
consider that to be a straw man, but I don't think it is. If the rich pay for

198
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,440
their kids to go to school, or the hospital, and the poor cannot pay, that

199
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,120
leads to a strictly defined class system, multi-generational poverty, and an

200
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
unending nightmare for most of the human population. And I think this speaks to a

201
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,760
much larger point, that effective personal solutions are not always going

202
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,760
to translate to being effective social solutions. Personal libertarianism can be

203
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,360
admirable as a framework through which you order your life. You value hard work,

204
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,560
you understand the nature of competition, and you never ever give up because what

205
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,920
you want is more important than the obstacles you face. You temper yourself

206
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,080
through hardship, but this philosophy applied society-wide leads to widespread

207
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,680
death and a return to the dark ages. There are other examples of personal

208
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,040
solutions not working as social solutions, some of which I intend to make

209
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,440
future videos on. Safe spaces, as defined by social justice, fall into this

210
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,760
category. Another simpler example of this rule of thumb is diet. Those of you who

211
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,560
have watched the other videos on this channel know that I'm a fatty. I'm

212
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,760
currently on a ketosis diet where you eat little to no carbs, that means

213
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,400
cutting out corn, bread, pasta, potatoes, and rice. It's a very effective personal

214
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,280
solution. However, I wouldn't advocate this as a universal solution. Rice, wheat,

215
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,360
and corn are the three biggest food staples in the world, easy to grow, cheap

216
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,960
at the marketplace. If everybody stopped eating these sources of cheap calories,

217
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,160
millions would starve and the food industry would collapse because we simply

218
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,600
don't have the capability to replace those staples on our farms with other

219
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,360
foods at the rate that 7.4 billion people would require. Enough about food

220
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,240
though. When somebody talks about the working poor as if they're simply lazy

221
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,880
and spending all their money on junk without saving it and trying to better

222
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,760
themselves, like this fellow on one of Sargon's videos saying,

223
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,440
as to minimum wage, if you're stupid and irresponsible, then you will not save a

224
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,160
penny. If you have that kind of job and want kids, big house, new TV, etc., it's

225
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,840
your selfish choices, not survival. I think their core lack of understanding

226
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,120
comes from not knowing that personal solutions do not function as social

227
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,200
solutions. When the libertarian social solution is to dismantle a safety net, to

228
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,320
remove the ability of a worker to get back on their feet and contribute again

229
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,760
and improve their standing again, all in the name of allowing the best to rise to

230
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,120
the top and letting the rest sink to the bottom, the libertarian personal

231
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,200
solutions of tenacity and work ethic will not help a worker who has no chance

232
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,400
of ever recovering from the poverty that sickness or injury will leave them in.

233
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,800
Society needs all workers contributing production, not just the best, but the

234
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,480
best and everybody else. And the libertarian philosophy of rewarding the

235
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,280
best and abandoning everybody else just isn't going to cut it.

236
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,000
Hey guys, I hope you enjoyed the first SF opinions. I would like to do more of

237
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,920
these in the future and I do have some topic ideas, so if you guys think this is

238
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,360
a series worth continuing, please let me know in the comments. And if there's

239
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,240
something you'd like me to chat about for a while, let me know about that too.

240
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,840
I'd like to try to do one of these twice a week, but it really just depends on how

241
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,040
much interest there is. The next one I put out is either going to be on the

242
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,320
nature of pedophilia in the light of Sarah Butts, or alternatively the state of

243
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,600
World of Warcraft as we go into the next expansion. I hope you enjoyed this sort

244
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,680
of thing though, and make sure to come back and check it out.
