00:00.000 --> 00:07.320
I'm not a big Lord of the Rings guy.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.920
I watched the original three movies as a kid, and I thought they were pretty good.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.840
And I think at one point, maybe about ten years ago, Dave and I sat down and watched

00:13.840 --> 00:16.060
the extended editions of all three movies in one day.

00:16.060 --> 00:20.120
And while that was, um, an interesting experience, I don't think I'd ever do that again.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.060
I tried to watch the first Hobbit movie, and it was okay, but not enough for me to go back

00:23.060 --> 00:24.200
for the second and third ones.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.560
I never saw those cartoon versions, though the clips of them on YouTube are pretty funny.

00:27.560 --> 00:41.920
And when I was really young, I rented the Super Nintendo game, the worst three bucks

00:41.920 --> 00:43.040
I ever spent.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.440
My interaction with the Lord of the Rings fandom in the past few years, therefore, has

00:46.440 --> 00:51.340
been peripheral, and only through the wider Are Orcs Racist conversation that has been

00:51.340 --> 00:52.600
permeating the internet.

00:52.600 --> 00:57.280
Now, I know that conversation is primarily about tabletop gaming, and to a lesser extent

00:57.280 --> 00:58.280
video games.

00:58.280 --> 01:02.820
But those depictions of orcs stem from Tolkien's innovation, and to the progressive's credit,

01:02.820 --> 01:05.880
he describes them like this, as published in the letters of J.R.R.

01:05.880 --> 01:06.880
Tolkien.

01:06.880 --> 01:11.500
The orcs are definitively stated to be corruptions of the human form seen in elves and men.

01:11.500 --> 01:17.680
They are, or were, squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant

01:17.680 --> 01:18.680
eyes.

01:18.680 --> 01:24.720
In fact, degraded and repulsive versions of the, to Europeans, least lovely Mongol types.

01:24.720 --> 01:30.200
So fair enough, Tolkien, being a man of his time, had that 1950s casual racism, and it

01:30.200 --> 01:31.200
bled into his work.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.200
The left-ways have a point there.

01:32.200 --> 01:35.520
But I don't believe that this means that orcs have to be changed, nor do I believe

01:35.520 --> 01:40.120
that they are a one-to-one stand-in for Middle-earth's Mongolian or African populations.

01:40.120 --> 01:43.660
If appealing to stereotypes is all that's needed to make something racist, then the

01:43.660 --> 01:46.760
entirety of the Black Panther movie certainly qualifies.

01:46.760 --> 01:50.600
What's more important is that orcs have become something unique and entirely of their

01:50.600 --> 01:54.960
own, despite their origins, especially if you look at derivative works like Warcraft

01:54.960 --> 01:57.480
or Elder Scrolls or many a fantasy hentai.

01:57.480 --> 02:01.160
Of course, none of this stops the progs from endlessly publishing articles about how orcs

02:01.160 --> 02:03.500
are a species built for racial terror.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.080
Jesus, let it go, man.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.840
If you see an orc in a game and you think, black guy, it's far more likely that you're

02:08.840 --> 02:09.840
the racist.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.480
A trope's origin doesn't matter.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.480
Let people enjoy fun things.

02:13.480 --> 02:17.720
Unfortunately though, this nonsense has paved the way for Lord of the Rings to be updated

02:17.720 --> 02:22.700
for a modern audience and global standards, which means turned into a lifeless grey sludge,

02:22.700 --> 02:26.280
unoffensive to nobody but containing no actual nutritional value.

02:26.280 --> 02:31.240
February 10th, 2022, Vanity Fair Amazon's Lord of the Rings series rises,

02:31.240 --> 02:32.760
inside the Rings of Power.

02:32.760 --> 02:37.220
One show to rule them all, the first look at a billion-dollar saga set thousands of

02:37.220 --> 02:38.760
years before J.R.R.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.480
Tolkien's legendary trilogy.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.480
In other words, Amazon's doing a Lord of the Rings show and it looks like shit.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.840
Let's take a look at it.

02:44.840 --> 02:48.040
Galadriel's not the queen-like figure she was in the original movies.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.720
Now she's more of a battle princess type.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.360
I know she wasn't a queen, I'm just using an expression here.

02:52.360 --> 02:55.760
And while her armor looks okay, the sword seems kind of cheap.

02:55.760 --> 02:59.520
She's leading armies and going on adventures herself now, something that was a bit outside

02:59.520 --> 03:01.720
of her character in the original version.

03:01.720 --> 03:02.720
But it gets worse.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.180
We've also got a black dwarven queen.

03:05.180 --> 03:07.560
This image is not lore accurate at all.

03:07.560 --> 03:10.560
I don't mean by the fact that she's black, it's true that Tolkien never described the

03:10.560 --> 03:13.500
dwarves as black, but to me that's a minor thing, it's just whatever.

03:13.500 --> 03:17.460
The issue is that it explicitly removes something unique to dwarves, that female dwarves have

03:17.460 --> 03:18.460
beards.

03:18.460 --> 03:19.460
Tolkien wrote,

03:19.460 --> 03:24.500
No man nor elf has ever seen a beardless dwarf, unless he were shaven in mockery, and would

03:24.500 --> 03:26.780
then be more like to die of shame.

03:26.780 --> 03:31.540
For the Nogrim have beards from the beginning of their lives, male and female alike.

03:31.540 --> 03:32.540
And why not?

03:32.540 --> 03:33.540
Why no bearded dwarves?

03:33.540 --> 03:37.200
You'd be doing a great thing for that representation checklist that you're desperately trying

03:37.200 --> 03:38.620
to fulfill, Amazon.

03:38.620 --> 03:39.880
Body positivity and all that.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.100
Give us the bearded dwarves.

03:41.100 --> 03:45.060
Do female dwarves have beards?

03:45.060 --> 03:46.060
Eh?

03:46.060 --> 03:47.060
Yes.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.060
Yes.

03:48.060 --> 03:51.940
No, of course they don't, they're female, aren't they?

03:51.940 --> 03:55.880
You know, when Naomi and I sat down and watched season two of The Witcher, we were actually

03:55.880 --> 04:00.540
a bit surprised and then delighted that they put in bearded female dwarves in that show.

04:00.540 --> 04:03.880
It seemed like something that Hollywood never had the balls to do, and yet they did it.

04:03.880 --> 04:04.880
It was cool.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.980
And notice in the shot how nobody in universe makes a big deal about it.

04:07.980 --> 04:10.300
She's just there doing her thing like it's normal.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.860
That shot is for the fans to notice and react to.

04:12.860 --> 04:13.860
Like we did.

04:13.860 --> 04:14.860
In case it's not obvious yet.

04:14.860 --> 04:17.300
The new Lord of the Rings show is not for fans.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.640
Next up is the black elf.

04:18.640 --> 04:19.640
And okay, I get it.

04:19.640 --> 04:20.640
It's a black elf.

04:20.640 --> 04:21.640
Just like the black dwarf.

04:21.640 --> 04:22.640
Fine.

04:22.640 --> 04:23.900
We can have different skin colors of these races.

04:23.900 --> 04:24.940
I don't really care.

04:24.940 --> 04:27.740
The issue with the black dwarf isn't that she's black, it's that she doesn't look like

04:27.740 --> 04:28.740
a dwarf.

04:28.740 --> 04:32.780
When the characteristics of black representation collide with the accurate portrayals of lore,

04:32.780 --> 04:33.780
the lore loses.

04:33.780 --> 04:35.920
It's the same with the black elf.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.100
Elves have long hair and they're meant to look otherworldly.

04:39.100 --> 04:42.740
This looks like a regular black guy with spirit Halloween ears.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.300
There are many examples of the dark skinned elf look and fantasy that could have been

04:46.300 --> 04:47.300
adapted.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.420
Hell, again, even hentai does it better.

04:49.420 --> 04:54.280
Probably worst of all is that this character is meant to be a gray elf, a subrace of elves

04:54.280 --> 04:57.060
that is specifically extremely pale.

04:57.060 --> 04:58.060
Actually no.

04:58.060 --> 05:01.620
Worst of all is the fact that the black elf story involves him having a forbidden relationship

05:01.620 --> 05:05.780
with a white human woman upon which he goes off to adventure and she's left as a single

05:05.780 --> 05:06.780
mother.

05:06.780 --> 05:07.780
Man.

05:07.780 --> 05:11.900
Even their ham-fisted attempts at representation backfires into overt racism.

05:11.900 --> 05:12.900
It's just amazing.

05:12.900 --> 05:14.700
We have a similar problem with Elrond.

05:14.700 --> 05:18.020
Yeah, nobody can replace Agent Smith, but that's just the nature of working with real

05:18.020 --> 05:19.100
actors who age.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.900
The problem is, he looks like a human wearing plastic ears again.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.700
The clothes, the hair, it just doesn't look right.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.940
This isn't Star Trek.

05:24.940 --> 05:29.040
Elves are not just another race like the Vulcans are to humans in that universe.

05:29.040 --> 05:33.180
Elves are supposed to be wholly separate from the mortal races and should appear as such.

05:33.180 --> 05:37.100
There's other dumb stuff too, like the nomadic wanderers having giant antlers on their backs

05:37.100 --> 05:41.220
for no reason other than it looks, uh, I was going to say looks cool, but it's not cool.

05:41.220 --> 05:42.220
It looks different.

05:42.220 --> 05:45.500
I mean, it makes you notice it, but for all the wrong reasons, it's just dumb.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.900
These guys aren't main characters or anything, so it's just a throwaway moment where they

05:48.900 --> 05:52.900
appear for a few seconds to set the tone of the series, but it just looks really stupid.

05:52.900 --> 05:56.900
If you guys are nomadic hunters, why are you wearing giant antlers on your back that might

05:56.900 --> 06:02.100
make say a bear or a lion or a wolf think that you are their prey from far away?

06:02.100 --> 06:04.460
It's literally the opposite of camouflage.

06:04.460 --> 06:06.340
These scenes look genuinely awful.

06:06.340 --> 06:10.300
Even disregarding the lore stuff, the production value isn't good, certainly not one billion

06:10.300 --> 06:11.300
dollars good.

06:11.300 --> 06:16.020
It looks like a generic fantasy ripoff show that some mid-tier TV channel like FX or something

06:16.020 --> 06:19.420
would make, only for it to be forgotten about a few weeks after it drops.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.860
But because it has the Lord of the Rings name slapped on it, people will keep talking about

06:22.860 --> 06:27.180
this shit for years, like it's somehow a cultural phenomenon, branding all of its detractors

06:27.180 --> 06:30.620
as misogynists, because clearly the only reason anyone would hate it is because it got strong

06:30.620 --> 06:31.660
female leads.

06:31.660 --> 06:35.460
And when it inevitably ends, it will be remembered as another dire warning, another corpse atop

06:35.460 --> 06:39.780
a mountain of corpses of formerly beloved franchises that corpos suck the life out of

06:39.780 --> 06:42.740
in the name of diversity, inclusion, and equity.

06:42.740 --> 06:46.860
Listen kid, if it took this abomination for you to finally feel fucking seen, you're not

06:46.860 --> 06:50.060
actually a black person, you're fucking transparent.

06:50.060 --> 06:54.060
Just in case you thought, oh maybe it's just the set design, maybe it's the costume, maybe

06:54.060 --> 06:57.540
it's just the casting, maybe the script will be good.

06:57.540 --> 07:04.140
Well, part of the script was leaked, just one little sequence, and it is fucking awful.

07:04.140 --> 07:05.820
I don't care.

07:05.820 --> 07:08.940
They say that you're under his spell.

07:08.940 --> 07:14.220
You can't be trusted, because you're too lonely and lovesick to know any better.

07:14.220 --> 07:19.460
Well you know, it won't be easy for me to drag you from this house, but I'll do it.

07:19.460 --> 07:21.700
Why should they trust you?

07:21.700 --> 07:23.860
Trust either of us.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.780
We don't even trust each other.

07:25.780 --> 07:27.180
I trust you.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.180
No you don't.

07:28.180 --> 07:33.580
You're too afraid I'll end up like father, gone.

07:33.580 --> 07:34.580
Oh my god.

07:34.580 --> 07:35.580
Oh my god.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.100
I can't wait to go out tonight and get fucked.

07:38.100 --> 07:42.900
Yeah, it reads like it's out of something like a Degrassi teen drama show.

07:42.900 --> 07:47.260
And by the way, when I say the phrase, when it ends, don't hold your breath, because Amazon's

07:47.260 --> 07:50.220
paid for five seasons of this garbage.

07:50.220 --> 07:54.620
It hasn't even come out yet, and it's a billion dollars, five seasons, on a show that looks

07:54.620 --> 07:58.980
this ass, that despite everything will probably still make them money disappointingly, all

07:58.980 --> 08:03.000
because Amazon wants to secure the Lord of the Rings brand for themselves.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.120
Christopher Tolkien, J.R.R. Tolkien's son, died on January 16th, 2020.

08:09.120 --> 08:13.560
Christopher was well known for relentlessly safeguarding, we may even say gatekeeping,

08:13.560 --> 08:16.000
the Lord of the Rings property from corrupting influences.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.920
The original movies were not perfect, but they were as good as they were, in part, because

08:19.920 --> 08:22.720
of the Tolkien estate's insistence on accuracy.

08:22.720 --> 08:27.040
On August 31st, 2017, Christopher resigned as the head of the estate, wanting to live

08:27.040 --> 08:29.120
out his remaining years in retirement.

08:29.120 --> 08:33.080
Afterward, while other Tolkien family members remained involved in the running of the estate,

08:33.080 --> 08:38.080
a new legal entity became its main solicitor, Meyer Blackburn LLC.

08:38.080 --> 08:43.920
That company has two partners, Stephen Andrew Meyer and Kathleen Blackburn, both of whom

08:43.920 --> 08:46.640
were lawyers for the estate under Christopher.

08:46.640 --> 08:51.840
And by the 13th of November, 2017, less than two months after Christopher retired, Amazon

08:51.840 --> 08:55.720
had purchased the TV rights to the property for 250 million dollars.

08:55.720 --> 09:00.600
I'm not outlining all this to say that Meyer and Blackburn somehow stole the Tolkien estate

09:00.600 --> 09:04.320
away from the Tolkien family and how horrendous an injustice it is or something like that,

09:04.320 --> 09:05.640
there's truly no way to know.

09:05.640 --> 09:10.280
The only thing I'm saying is, after the director of the estate became somebody who was not

09:10.280 --> 09:14.720
a member of the Tolkien family, the TV rights to the Lord of the Rings were sold to Amazon.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.820
I'm sure they made a shit ton of money on it, I'm sure the surviving Tolkien's also

09:17.820 --> 09:21.460
got their cut too, but this is what happens when control of these properties transfers

09:21.460 --> 09:25.460
from a creator to a corporation, and the entertainment media is in on it.

09:25.460 --> 09:29.920
They know what steps have to be taken next to make this go over as smoothly as possible.

09:29.920 --> 09:33.900
They know it's time to sideline the Tolkien component of Lord of the Rings in order to

09:33.900 --> 09:35.700
privilege what's currently being made.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.700
L.O.T.R.

09:36.700 --> 09:40.620
The Rings of Power's new non-Tolkien elf and dwarf character details.

09:40.620 --> 09:43.580
Yeah, that little phrase is why we know it's shit.

09:43.580 --> 09:47.180
You know, you can actually write new lore, as long as it's in line with old lore.

09:47.180 --> 09:51.220
It doesn't need to be written by Tolkien, but it has to be in the style of Tolkien.

09:51.220 --> 09:55.120
Holding up non-Tolkien as a selling point is exactly the thing that you don't want

09:55.120 --> 09:56.600
to see here as a fan.

09:56.600 --> 10:00.860
New images from the Rings of Power show us a side of Middle Earth ignored by Tolkien

10:00.860 --> 10:01.860
and Jackson.

10:01.860 --> 10:04.600
It's not ignored by Tolkien if Tolkien didn't write it.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.940
That means it doesn't exist, it's a fictional world.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.860
If the creator didn't write a thing, that doesn't mean that he ignored it, that means

10:09.860 --> 10:11.520
it was not actually created.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.320
It felt only natural to us that an adaptation of Tolkien's work would reflect what the

10:15.320 --> 10:17.120
world actually looks like.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.160
Tolkien is for everyone.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.160
It's a fictional world.

10:20.160 --> 10:24.280
It looks like what Tolkien wrote, and Tolkien is not for non-Tolkien fans.

10:24.280 --> 10:25.280
As simple as that.

10:25.280 --> 10:28.760
It's the height of arrogance to take a property and claim that its original creator failed

10:28.760 --> 10:32.780
to spotlight a component of it by not creating it in the first place.

10:32.780 --> 10:37.240
Can we come up with a novel Tolkien never wrote and do it as the mega event series that

10:37.240 --> 10:38.680
can only happen now?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.680
Again, height of arrogance.

10:40.680 --> 10:44.360
These people are not acting like the inheritors, the stewards of the property they've been

10:44.360 --> 10:47.440
given, to organically grow a new component out of.

10:47.440 --> 10:51.020
They're acting like L.O.T.R. is an empty bottle that can be filled with whatever the holder

10:51.020 --> 10:54.400
wants to put in it, even if the liquid they choose is diarrhea.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.280
When you treat a property like that, you will rapidly find that nobody actually wants to

10:58.280 --> 10:59.280
drink it.

10:59.280 --> 11:03.380
This quote, by Tolkien, has been floating around ever since this series was announced.

11:03.380 --> 11:07.280
Evil cannot create anything new, they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have

11:07.280 --> 11:08.360
invented or made.

11:08.360 --> 11:13.860
The quote was spammed on the Rings of Power's trailer so much until Amazon began to censor

11:13.860 --> 11:18.420
the phrase, so now it's just being reposted in a bunch of different languages.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.100
But here's a more important quote.

11:20.100 --> 11:24.480
Peter Jackson, in 2002, there are certainly themes Tolkien felt were important.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.640
We made a promise to ourselves at the beginning of the process that we weren't going to

11:27.640 --> 11:32.140
put any of our own politics, our own messages, or our own themes into these movies.

11:32.140 --> 11:35.780
What we were trying to do was analyze what was important to Tolkien and try to honor

11:35.780 --> 11:36.780
that.

11:36.780 --> 11:39.940
In a way, we were trying to make these films for him, not for us.

11:39.940 --> 11:41.340
This is the ideal.

11:41.340 --> 11:45.800
Make the movie for people who appreciate Tolkien, not for everyone, because if it's for everyone,

11:45.800 --> 11:46.800
it's going to be shit.

11:46.800 --> 11:50.160
If it's something to be interesting enough to be good, those qualities that make it stand

11:50.160 --> 11:54.040
out have to also be interesting enough for it to be bad to somebody else.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.840
If it's for everyone, then it's just unexciting and bland.

11:56.840 --> 12:00.800
And although nobody's palette will be offended, nobody will actually care.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.720
In my Whoopi Goldberg video, I made an error about what Gina Serrano said that got her

12:04.720 --> 12:06.000
axe from the Mandalorian.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.720
What she actually posted was this,

12:07.720 --> 12:12.480
Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors, even by children.

12:12.480 --> 12:16.140
Because history is edited, most people today don't realize that to get to the point where

12:16.140 --> 12:20.360
Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own

12:20.360 --> 12:23.020
neighbors hate them for simply being Jews.

12:23.020 --> 12:26.440
How is that any different for hating someone for their political views?

12:26.440 --> 12:29.500
And this post was enough for her to lose that Mandalorian spot.

12:29.500 --> 12:33.140
People screamed bloody murder that she no longer deserved to represent such an honored

12:33.140 --> 12:38.060
cultural hallmark as Star Wars for things that she said off-show on social media.

12:38.060 --> 12:42.860
Almost as if the character of Cara Dune was an office that somebody held, in the institution

12:42.860 --> 12:46.120
that is Star Wars, and not an acting job in a sci-fi show.

12:46.120 --> 12:50.980
When I talked about consumption as representation, I was describing the merger of leftist politics

12:50.980 --> 12:55.320
where representation always matters, and matters the most, with the corporate desire to position

12:55.320 --> 12:59.780
every brand as more than just entertainment, but an essential cultural phenomenon through

12:59.780 --> 13:02.640
which people filter their daily experiences through.

13:02.640 --> 13:07.640
The natural end result of this amalgamation is a quasi-religious reverence for popular

13:07.640 --> 13:08.640
properties.

13:08.640 --> 13:12.880
Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, Ghostbusters, whatever.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.720
It was always this way for the mega-fans of the past, sure.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.760
We always had Trekkies or Nintendrones.

13:17.760 --> 13:22.320
But this attitude has moved outside of that insular sphere, and has now become the wider

13:22.320 --> 13:23.320
culture.

13:23.320 --> 13:27.000
These properties have stopped being added to organically by caring stewards, and have

13:27.000 --> 13:30.920
instead become the empty jar that can be filled with the desires of whoever happens to buy

13:30.920 --> 13:31.920
it.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.160
And yet, everyone expects the fans to treat the property like it's the former, and not

13:35.160 --> 13:36.160
the latter.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.160
Here's an example of what I mean.

13:37.160 --> 13:40.920
When Christopher Nolan announced that Batman Begins would be a new take, and not continuing

13:40.920 --> 13:45.000
the most recent movie Batman lore, people generally didn't care, partially because

13:45.000 --> 13:48.680
the last few movies sucked ass, but also because the new continuity wasn't going

13:48.680 --> 13:51.900
to take away from the total canon, but instead add to it.

13:51.900 --> 13:56.000
It wasn't demanding that this is the story now, it was offering another interpretation,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
among many.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.320
It was the next growth on the vine, the next brick placed on the wall.

14:00.320 --> 14:03.260
It wasn't destroying everything and starting from scratch.

14:03.260 --> 14:07.800
But now that these things aren't just entertainment, but they're cultural institutions, the actors

14:07.800 --> 14:11.640
and actresses who are cast into these roles are representatives of the proper politics,

14:11.640 --> 14:15.040
and need to act accordingly, unless they want to be treated like Gina Serrano.

14:15.040 --> 14:18.960
It's not just that Serrano said what she said, it's that she said it while inhabiting the

14:18.960 --> 14:20.680
illustrious position of Cara Dune.

14:20.680 --> 14:24.680
An equivalent to fantasy failure is the new Game of Thrones show, which features a black

14:24.680 --> 14:29.300
Valyrian, a race of people who are pale skinned with purple eyes, because why the fuck not.

14:29.300 --> 14:32.320
Also Matt Smith looks awful, Jesus Christ.

14:32.320 --> 14:35.160
The point I'm getting at, is you can look at any of the images I'm displaying on screen

14:35.160 --> 14:39.400
right now, and find a hundred problems with them, whether that's lore problems or quality

14:39.400 --> 14:40.400
problems.

14:40.400 --> 14:44.600
You can't actually object to those problems, because the corporations that run the show

14:44.600 --> 14:49.220
are positioning these properties as not just entertainment, but as institutions, essential

14:49.220 --> 14:51.240
components of our cultural tapestry.

14:51.240 --> 14:55.600
And because another component of that tapestry is diversity, inclusion, equity.

14:55.600 --> 15:00.040
When you criticize the shows, you're criticizing the institutions, and when you criticize the

15:00.040 --> 15:01.960
institutions, you're criticizing the politics.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.380
That's how they've set this up.

15:03.380 --> 15:07.160
It's not only that if the stewards of these properties are willing to change lore, then

15:07.160 --> 15:09.800
they're willing to change other things to shoehorn a political message.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.880
That certainly happens, but that's surface level.

15:11.880 --> 15:16.280
What's deeper, is that your objection to being fed this sludge, is considered an objection

15:16.280 --> 15:17.840
to the political message that comes with it.

15:17.840 --> 15:22.120
So even if you're a leftoid who just happens to also have an eye for film quality, if you

15:22.120 --> 15:25.400
object, you're a filthy reactionary trump-tard fascist.

15:25.400 --> 15:29.000
So fuck it, we all know it's going to be shit, and we all know exactly what the corpos, the

15:29.000 --> 15:32.040
media, and the progs are going to say about our objections as they march in lockstep.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.640
So I'm just going to have fun with it.

15:33.640 --> 15:37.440
After the shit show that was Santa Inc, I stopped caring if smoothbrands on the internet

15:37.440 --> 15:41.480
thought it was a fascism to object to having someone directly shit down the cable into

15:41.480 --> 15:42.480
your TV.

15:42.480 --> 15:46.600
The rings of power looks like an unmitigated disaster, and I can't wait to pirate the fuck

15:46.600 --> 15:50.160
out of it and turn it into a review for my channel, because that's all it's worth.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.560
OMG, like, I totes don't care.

15:53.560 --> 15:59.160
They say you're under a spell, you can't be trusted, because you're too lonely and

15:59.160 --> 16:01.640
lovesick to know any better.

16:01.640 --> 16:06.720
I feel like totes won't be easy for me to, like, drag you from this house, but I'll,

16:06.720 --> 16:09.040
like, totally do it.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.360
Why should they trust you?

16:11.360 --> 16:14.440
Trust either of us, we don't even trust each other!

16:14.440 --> 16:16.680
I, like, totes trust you, babe.

16:16.680 --> 16:17.680
No you don't!

16:17.680 --> 16:22.240
You're too afraid, and I'm like, father, gahhh!

16:22.240 --> 16:23.520
Bitch.
