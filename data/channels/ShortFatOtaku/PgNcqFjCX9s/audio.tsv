0	7320	I'm not a big Lord of the Rings guy.
7320	9920	I watched the original three movies as a kid, and I thought they were pretty good.
9920	13840	And I think at one point, maybe about ten years ago, Dave and I sat down and watched
13840	16060	the extended editions of all three movies in one day.
16060	20120	And while that was, um, an interesting experience, I don't think I'd ever do that again.
20120	23060	I tried to watch the first Hobbit movie, and it was okay, but not enough for me to go back
23060	24200	for the second and third ones.
24200	27560	I never saw those cartoon versions, though the clips of them on YouTube are pretty funny.
27560	41920	And when I was really young, I rented the Super Nintendo game, the worst three bucks
41920	43040	I ever spent.
43040	46440	My interaction with the Lord of the Rings fandom in the past few years, therefore, has
46440	51340	been peripheral, and only through the wider Are Orcs Racist conversation that has been
51340	52600	permeating the internet.
52600	57280	Now, I know that conversation is primarily about tabletop gaming, and to a lesser extent
57280	58280	video games.
58280	62820	But those depictions of orcs stem from Tolkien's innovation, and to the progressive's credit,
62820	65880	he describes them like this, as published in the letters of J.R.R.
65880	66880	Tolkien.
66880	71500	The orcs are definitively stated to be corruptions of the human form seen in elves and men.
71500	77680	They are, or were, squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant
77680	78680	eyes.
78680	84720	In fact, degraded and repulsive versions of the, to Europeans, least lovely Mongol types.
84720	90200	So fair enough, Tolkien, being a man of his time, had that 1950s casual racism, and it
90200	91200	bled into his work.
91200	92200	The left-ways have a point there.
92200	95520	But I don't believe that this means that orcs have to be changed, nor do I believe
95520	100120	that they are a one-to-one stand-in for Middle-earth's Mongolian or African populations.
100120	103660	If appealing to stereotypes is all that's needed to make something racist, then the
103660	106760	entirety of the Black Panther movie certainly qualifies.
106760	110600	What's more important is that orcs have become something unique and entirely of their
110600	114960	own, despite their origins, especially if you look at derivative works like Warcraft
114960	117480	or Elder Scrolls or many a fantasy hentai.
117480	121160	Of course, none of this stops the progs from endlessly publishing articles about how orcs
121160	123500	are a species built for racial terror.
123500	125080	Jesus, let it go, man.
125080	128840	If you see an orc in a game and you think, black guy, it's far more likely that you're
128840	129840	the racist.
129840	131480	A trope's origin doesn't matter.
131480	133480	Let people enjoy fun things.
133480	137720	Unfortunately though, this nonsense has paved the way for Lord of the Rings to be updated
137720	142700	for a modern audience and global standards, which means turned into a lifeless grey sludge,
142700	146280	unoffensive to nobody but containing no actual nutritional value.
146280	151240	February 10th, 2022, Vanity Fair Amazon's Lord of the Rings series rises,
151240	152760	inside the Rings of Power.
152760	157220	One show to rule them all, the first look at a billion-dollar saga set thousands of
157220	158760	years before J.R.R.
158760	160480	Tolkien's legendary trilogy.
160480	163480	In other words, Amazon's doing a Lord of the Rings show and it looks like shit.
163480	164840	Let's take a look at it.
164840	168040	Galadriel's not the queen-like figure she was in the original movies.
168040	169720	Now she's more of a battle princess type.
169720	172360	I know she wasn't a queen, I'm just using an expression here.
172360	175760	And while her armor looks okay, the sword seems kind of cheap.
175760	179520	She's leading armies and going on adventures herself now, something that was a bit outside
179520	181720	of her character in the original version.
181720	182720	But it gets worse.
182720	185180	We've also got a black dwarven queen.
185180	187560	This image is not lore accurate at all.
187560	190560	I don't mean by the fact that she's black, it's true that Tolkien never described the
190560	193500	dwarves as black, but to me that's a minor thing, it's just whatever.
193500	197460	The issue is that it explicitly removes something unique to dwarves, that female dwarves have
197460	198460	beards.
198460	199460	Tolkien wrote,
199460	204500	No man nor elf has ever seen a beardless dwarf, unless he were shaven in mockery, and would
204500	206780	then be more like to die of shame.
206780	211540	For the Nogrim have beards from the beginning of their lives, male and female alike.
211540	212540	And why not?
212540	213540	Why no bearded dwarves?
213540	217200	You'd be doing a great thing for that representation checklist that you're desperately trying
217200	218620	to fulfill, Amazon.
218620	219880	Body positivity and all that.
219880	221100	Give us the bearded dwarves.
221100	225060	Do female dwarves have beards?
225060	226060	Eh?
226060	227060	Yes.
227060	228060	Yes.
228060	231940	No, of course they don't, they're female, aren't they?
231940	235880	You know, when Naomi and I sat down and watched season two of The Witcher, we were actually
235880	240540	a bit surprised and then delighted that they put in bearded female dwarves in that show.
240540	243880	It seemed like something that Hollywood never had the balls to do, and yet they did it.
243880	244880	It was cool.
244880	247980	And notice in the shot how nobody in universe makes a big deal about it.
247980	250300	She's just there doing her thing like it's normal.
250300	252860	That shot is for the fans to notice and react to.
252860	253860	Like we did.
253860	254860	In case it's not obvious yet.
254860	257300	The new Lord of the Rings show is not for fans.
257300	258640	Next up is the black elf.
258640	259640	And okay, I get it.
259640	260640	It's a black elf.
260640	261640	Just like the black dwarf.
261640	262640	Fine.
262640	263900	We can have different skin colors of these races.
263900	264940	I don't really care.
264940	267740	The issue with the black dwarf isn't that she's black, it's that she doesn't look like
267740	268740	a dwarf.
268740	272780	When the characteristics of black representation collide with the accurate portrayals of lore,
272780	273780	the lore loses.
273780	275920	It's the same with the black elf.
275920	279100	Elves have long hair and they're meant to look otherworldly.
279100	282740	This looks like a regular black guy with spirit Halloween ears.
282740	286300	There are many examples of the dark skinned elf look and fantasy that could have been
286300	287300	adapted.
287300	289420	Hell, again, even hentai does it better.
289420	294280	Probably worst of all is that this character is meant to be a gray elf, a subrace of elves
294280	297060	that is specifically extremely pale.
297060	298060	Actually no.
298060	301620	Worst of all is the fact that the black elf story involves him having a forbidden relationship
301620	305780	with a white human woman upon which he goes off to adventure and she's left as a single
305780	306780	mother.
306780	307780	Man.
307780	311900	Even their ham-fisted attempts at representation backfires into overt racism.
311900	312900	It's just amazing.
312900	314700	We have a similar problem with Elrond.
314700	318020	Yeah, nobody can replace Agent Smith, but that's just the nature of working with real
318020	319100	actors who age.
319100	321900	The problem is, he looks like a human wearing plastic ears again.
321900	323700	The clothes, the hair, it just doesn't look right.
323700	324940	This isn't Star Trek.
324940	329040	Elves are not just another race like the Vulcans are to humans in that universe.
329040	333180	Elves are supposed to be wholly separate from the mortal races and should appear as such.
333180	337100	There's other dumb stuff too, like the nomadic wanderers having giant antlers on their backs
337100	341220	for no reason other than it looks, uh, I was going to say looks cool, but it's not cool.
341220	342220	It looks different.
342220	345500	I mean, it makes you notice it, but for all the wrong reasons, it's just dumb.
345500	348900	These guys aren't main characters or anything, so it's just a throwaway moment where they
348900	352900	appear for a few seconds to set the tone of the series, but it just looks really stupid.
352900	356900	If you guys are nomadic hunters, why are you wearing giant antlers on your back that might
356900	362100	make say a bear or a lion or a wolf think that you are their prey from far away?
362100	364460	It's literally the opposite of camouflage.
364460	366340	These scenes look genuinely awful.
366340	370300	Even disregarding the lore stuff, the production value isn't good, certainly not one billion
370300	371300	dollars good.
371300	376020	It looks like a generic fantasy ripoff show that some mid-tier TV channel like FX or something
376020	379420	would make, only for it to be forgotten about a few weeks after it drops.
379420	382860	But because it has the Lord of the Rings name slapped on it, people will keep talking about
382860	387180	this shit for years, like it's somehow a cultural phenomenon, branding all of its detractors
387180	390620	as misogynists, because clearly the only reason anyone would hate it is because it got strong
390620	391660	female leads.
391660	395460	And when it inevitably ends, it will be remembered as another dire warning, another corpse atop
395460	399780	a mountain of corpses of formerly beloved franchises that corpos suck the life out of
399780	402740	in the name of diversity, inclusion, and equity.
402740	406860	Listen kid, if it took this abomination for you to finally feel fucking seen, you're not
406860	410060	actually a black person, you're fucking transparent.
410060	414060	Just in case you thought, oh maybe it's just the set design, maybe it's the costume, maybe
414060	417540	it's just the casting, maybe the script will be good.
417540	424140	Well, part of the script was leaked, just one little sequence, and it is fucking awful.
424140	425820	I don't care.
425820	428940	They say that you're under his spell.
428940	434220	You can't be trusted, because you're too lonely and lovesick to know any better.
434220	439460	Well you know, it won't be easy for me to drag you from this house, but I'll do it.
439460	441700	Why should they trust you?
441700	443860	Trust either of us.
443860	445780	We don't even trust each other.
445780	447180	I trust you.
447180	448180	No you don't.
448180	453580	You're too afraid I'll end up like father, gone.
453580	454580	Oh my god.
454580	455580	Oh my god.
455580	458100	I can't wait to go out tonight and get fucked.
458100	462900	Yeah, it reads like it's out of something like a Degrassi teen drama show.
462900	467260	And by the way, when I say the phrase, when it ends, don't hold your breath, because Amazon's
467260	470220	paid for five seasons of this garbage.
470220	474620	It hasn't even come out yet, and it's a billion dollars, five seasons, on a show that looks
474620	478980	this ass, that despite everything will probably still make them money disappointingly, all
478980	483000	because Amazon wants to secure the Lord of the Rings brand for themselves.
484000	489120	Christopher Tolkien, J.R.R. Tolkien's son, died on January 16th, 2020.
489120	493560	Christopher was well known for relentlessly safeguarding, we may even say gatekeeping,
493560	496000	the Lord of the Rings property from corrupting influences.
496000	499920	The original movies were not perfect, but they were as good as they were, in part, because
499920	502720	of the Tolkien estate's insistence on accuracy.
502720	507040	On August 31st, 2017, Christopher resigned as the head of the estate, wanting to live
507040	509120	out his remaining years in retirement.
509120	513080	Afterward, while other Tolkien family members remained involved in the running of the estate,
513080	518080	a new legal entity became its main solicitor, Meyer Blackburn LLC.
518080	523920	That company has two partners, Stephen Andrew Meyer and Kathleen Blackburn, both of whom
523920	526640	were lawyers for the estate under Christopher.
526640	531840	And by the 13th of November, 2017, less than two months after Christopher retired, Amazon
531840	535720	had purchased the TV rights to the property for 250 million dollars.
535720	540600	I'm not outlining all this to say that Meyer and Blackburn somehow stole the Tolkien estate
540600	544320	away from the Tolkien family and how horrendous an injustice it is or something like that,
544320	545640	there's truly no way to know.
545640	550280	The only thing I'm saying is, after the director of the estate became somebody who was not
550280	554720	a member of the Tolkien family, the TV rights to the Lord of the Rings were sold to Amazon.
554720	557820	I'm sure they made a shit ton of money on it, I'm sure the surviving Tolkien's also
557820	561460	got their cut too, but this is what happens when control of these properties transfers
561460	565460	from a creator to a corporation, and the entertainment media is in on it.
565460	569920	They know what steps have to be taken next to make this go over as smoothly as possible.
569920	573900	They know it's time to sideline the Tolkien component of Lord of the Rings in order to
573900	575700	privilege what's currently being made.
575700	576700	L.O.T.R.
576700	580620	The Rings of Power's new non-Tolkien elf and dwarf character details.
580620	583580	Yeah, that little phrase is why we know it's shit.
583580	587180	You know, you can actually write new lore, as long as it's in line with old lore.
587180	591220	It doesn't need to be written by Tolkien, but it has to be in the style of Tolkien.
591220	595120	Holding up non-Tolkien as a selling point is exactly the thing that you don't want
595120	596600	to see here as a fan.
596600	600860	New images from the Rings of Power show us a side of Middle Earth ignored by Tolkien
600860	601860	and Jackson.
601860	604600	It's not ignored by Tolkien if Tolkien didn't write it.
604600	606940	That means it doesn't exist, it's a fictional world.
606940	609860	If the creator didn't write a thing, that doesn't mean that he ignored it, that means
609860	611520	it was not actually created.
611520	615320	It felt only natural to us that an adaptation of Tolkien's work would reflect what the
615320	617120	world actually looks like.
617120	618160	Tolkien is for everyone.
618160	620160	It's a fictional world.
620160	624280	It looks like what Tolkien wrote, and Tolkien is not for non-Tolkien fans.
624280	625280	As simple as that.
625280	628760	It's the height of arrogance to take a property and claim that its original creator failed
628760	632780	to spotlight a component of it by not creating it in the first place.
632780	637240	Can we come up with a novel Tolkien never wrote and do it as the mega event series that
637240	638680	can only happen now?
638680	640680	Again, height of arrogance.
640680	644360	These people are not acting like the inheritors, the stewards of the property they've been
644360	647440	given, to organically grow a new component out of.
647440	651020	They're acting like L.O.T.R. is an empty bottle that can be filled with whatever the holder
651020	654400	wants to put in it, even if the liquid they choose is diarrhea.
654400	658280	When you treat a property like that, you will rapidly find that nobody actually wants to
658280	659280	drink it.
659280	663380	This quote, by Tolkien, has been floating around ever since this series was announced.
663380	667280	Evil cannot create anything new, they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have
667280	668360	invented or made.
668360	673860	The quote was spammed on the Rings of Power's trailer so much until Amazon began to censor
673860	678420	the phrase, so now it's just being reposted in a bunch of different languages.
678420	680100	But here's a more important quote.
680100	684480	Peter Jackson, in 2002, there are certainly themes Tolkien felt were important.
684480	687640	We made a promise to ourselves at the beginning of the process that we weren't going to
687640	692140	put any of our own politics, our own messages, or our own themes into these movies.
692140	695780	What we were trying to do was analyze what was important to Tolkien and try to honor
695780	696780	that.
696780	699940	In a way, we were trying to make these films for him, not for us.
699940	701340	This is the ideal.
701340	705800	Make the movie for people who appreciate Tolkien, not for everyone, because if it's for everyone,
705800	706800	it's going to be shit.
706800	710160	If it's something to be interesting enough to be good, those qualities that make it stand
710160	714040	out have to also be interesting enough for it to be bad to somebody else.
714040	716840	If it's for everyone, then it's just unexciting and bland.
716840	720800	And although nobody's palette will be offended, nobody will actually care.
720800	724720	In my Whoopi Goldberg video, I made an error about what Gina Serrano said that got her
724720	726000	axe from the Mandalorian.
726000	727720	What she actually posted was this,
727720	732480	Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors, even by children.
732480	736140	Because history is edited, most people today don't realize that to get to the point where
736140	740360	Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own
740360	743020	neighbors hate them for simply being Jews.
743020	746440	How is that any different for hating someone for their political views?
746440	749500	And this post was enough for her to lose that Mandalorian spot.
749500	753140	People screamed bloody murder that she no longer deserved to represent such an honored
753140	758060	cultural hallmark as Star Wars for things that she said off-show on social media.
758060	762860	Almost as if the character of Cara Dune was an office that somebody held, in the institution
762860	766120	that is Star Wars, and not an acting job in a sci-fi show.
766120	770980	When I talked about consumption as representation, I was describing the merger of leftist politics
770980	775320	where representation always matters, and matters the most, with the corporate desire to position
775320	779780	every brand as more than just entertainment, but an essential cultural phenomenon through
779780	782640	which people filter their daily experiences through.
782640	787640	The natural end result of this amalgamation is a quasi-religious reverence for popular
787640	788640	properties.
788640	792880	Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, Ghostbusters, whatever.
792880	795720	It was always this way for the mega-fans of the past, sure.
795720	797760	We always had Trekkies or Nintendrones.
797760	802320	But this attitude has moved outside of that insular sphere, and has now become the wider
802320	803320	culture.
803320	807000	These properties have stopped being added to organically by caring stewards, and have
807000	810920	instead become the empty jar that can be filled with the desires of whoever happens to buy
810920	811920	it.
811920	815160	And yet, everyone expects the fans to treat the property like it's the former, and not
815160	816160	the latter.
816160	817160	Here's an example of what I mean.
817160	820920	When Christopher Nolan announced that Batman Begins would be a new take, and not continuing
820920	825000	the most recent movie Batman lore, people generally didn't care, partially because
825000	828680	the last few movies sucked ass, but also because the new continuity wasn't going
828680	831900	to take away from the total canon, but instead add to it.
831900	836000	It wasn't demanding that this is the story now, it was offering another interpretation,
836000	837000	among many.
837000	840320	It was the next growth on the vine, the next brick placed on the wall.
840320	843260	It wasn't destroying everything and starting from scratch.
843260	847800	But now that these things aren't just entertainment, but they're cultural institutions, the actors
847800	851640	and actresses who are cast into these roles are representatives of the proper politics,
851640	855040	and need to act accordingly, unless they want to be treated like Gina Serrano.
855040	858960	It's not just that Serrano said what she said, it's that she said it while inhabiting the
858960	860680	illustrious position of Cara Dune.
860680	864680	An equivalent to fantasy failure is the new Game of Thrones show, which features a black
864680	869300	Valyrian, a race of people who are pale skinned with purple eyes, because why the fuck not.
869300	872320	Also Matt Smith looks awful, Jesus Christ.
872320	875160	The point I'm getting at, is you can look at any of the images I'm displaying on screen
875160	879400	right now, and find a hundred problems with them, whether that's lore problems or quality
879400	880400	problems.
880400	884600	You can't actually object to those problems, because the corporations that run the show
884600	889220	are positioning these properties as not just entertainment, but as institutions, essential
889220	891240	components of our cultural tapestry.
891240	895600	And because another component of that tapestry is diversity, inclusion, equity.
895600	900040	When you criticize the shows, you're criticizing the institutions, and when you criticize the
900040	901960	institutions, you're criticizing the politics.
901960	903380	That's how they've set this up.
903380	907160	It's not only that if the stewards of these properties are willing to change lore, then
907160	909800	they're willing to change other things to shoehorn a political message.
909800	911880	That certainly happens, but that's surface level.
911880	916280	What's deeper, is that your objection to being fed this sludge, is considered an objection
916280	917840	to the political message that comes with it.
917840	922120	So even if you're a leftoid who just happens to also have an eye for film quality, if you
922120	925400	object, you're a filthy reactionary trump-tard fascist.
925400	929000	So fuck it, we all know it's going to be shit, and we all know exactly what the corpos, the
929000	932040	media, and the progs are going to say about our objections as they march in lockstep.
932040	933640	So I'm just going to have fun with it.
933640	937440	After the shit show that was Santa Inc, I stopped caring if smoothbrands on the internet
937440	941480	thought it was a fascism to object to having someone directly shit down the cable into
941480	942480	your TV.
942480	946600	The rings of power looks like an unmitigated disaster, and I can't wait to pirate the fuck
946600	950160	out of it and turn it into a review for my channel, because that's all it's worth.
950160	953560	OMG, like, I totes don't care.
953560	959160	They say you're under a spell, you can't be trusted, because you're too lonely and
959160	961640	lovesick to know any better.
961640	966720	I feel like totes won't be easy for me to, like, drag you from this house, but I'll,
966720	969040	like, totally do it.
969040	971360	Why should they trust you?
971360	974440	Trust either of us, we don't even trust each other!
974440	976680	I, like, totes trust you, babe.
976680	977680	No you don't!
977680	982240	You're too afraid, and I'm like, father, gahhh!
982240	983520	Bitch.
