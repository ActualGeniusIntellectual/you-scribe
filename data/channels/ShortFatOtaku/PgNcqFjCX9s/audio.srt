1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
I'm not a big Lord of the Rings guy.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,920
I watched the original three movies as a kid, and I thought they were pretty good.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,840
And I think at one point, maybe about ten years ago, Dave and I sat down and watched

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,060
the extended editions of all three movies in one day.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:20,120
And while that was, um, an interesting experience, I don't think I'd ever do that again.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,060
I tried to watch the first Hobbit movie, and it was okay, but not enough for me to go back

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,200
for the second and third ones.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,560
I never saw those cartoon versions, though the clips of them on YouTube are pretty funny.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:41,920
And when I was really young, I rented the Super Nintendo game, the worst three bucks

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,040
I ever spent.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,440
My interaction with the Lord of the Rings fandom in the past few years, therefore, has

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,340
been peripheral, and only through the wider Are Orcs Racist conversation that has been

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,600
permeating the internet.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,280
Now, I know that conversation is primarily about tabletop gaming, and to a lesser extent

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
video games.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,820
But those depictions of orcs stem from Tolkien's innovation, and to the progressive's credit,

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,880
he describes them like this, as published in the letters of J.R.R.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Tolkien.

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,500
The orcs are definitively stated to be corruptions of the human form seen in elves and men.

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:17,680
They are, or were, squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,680
eyes.

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,720
In fact, degraded and repulsive versions of the, to Europeans, least lovely Mongol types.

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,200
So fair enough, Tolkien, being a man of his time, had that 1950s casual racism, and it

24
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
bled into his work.

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
The left-ways have a point there.

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,520
But I don't believe that this means that orcs have to be changed, nor do I believe

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,120
that they are a one-to-one stand-in for Middle-earth's Mongolian or African populations.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,660
If appealing to stereotypes is all that's needed to make something racist, then the

29
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,760
entirety of the Black Panther movie certainly qualifies.

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,600
What's more important is that orcs have become something unique and entirely of their

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,960
own, despite their origins, especially if you look at derivative works like Warcraft

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,480
or Elder Scrolls or many a fantasy hentai.

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,160
Of course, none of this stops the progs from endlessly publishing articles about how orcs

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,500
are a species built for racial terror.

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,080
Jesus, let it go, man.

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,840
If you see an orc in a game and you think, black guy, it's far more likely that you're

37
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
the racist.

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,480
A trope's origin doesn't matter.

39
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,480
Let people enjoy fun things.

40
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,720
Unfortunately though, this nonsense has paved the way for Lord of the Rings to be updated

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,700
for a modern audience and global standards, which means turned into a lifeless grey sludge,

42
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,280
unoffensive to nobody but containing no actual nutritional value.

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,240
February 10th, 2022, Vanity Fair Amazon's Lord of the Rings series rises,

44
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,760
inside the Rings of Power.

45
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,220
One show to rule them all, the first look at a billion-dollar saga set thousands of

46
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,760
years before J.R.R.

47
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,480
Tolkien's legendary trilogy.

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,480
In other words, Amazon's doing a Lord of the Rings show and it looks like shit.

49
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,840
Let's take a look at it.

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,040
Galadriel's not the queen-like figure she was in the original movies.

51
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,720
Now she's more of a battle princess type.

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,360
I know she wasn't a queen, I'm just using an expression here.

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,760
And while her armor looks okay, the sword seems kind of cheap.

54
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,520
She's leading armies and going on adventures herself now, something that was a bit outside

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,720
of her character in the original version.

56
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
But it gets worse.

57
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,180
We've also got a black dwarven queen.

58
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,560
This image is not lore accurate at all.

59
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,560
I don't mean by the fact that she's black, it's true that Tolkien never described the

60
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,500
dwarves as black, but to me that's a minor thing, it's just whatever.

61
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,460
The issue is that it explicitly removes something unique to dwarves, that female dwarves have

62
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
beards.

63
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,460
Tolkien wrote,

64
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,500
No man nor elf has ever seen a beardless dwarf, unless he were shaven in mockery, and would

65
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,780
then be more like to die of shame.

66
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,540
For the Nogrim have beards from the beginning of their lives, male and female alike.

67
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,540
And why not?

68
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,540
Why no bearded dwarves?

69
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,200
You'd be doing a great thing for that representation checklist that you're desperately trying

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,620
to fulfill, Amazon.

71
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,880
Body positivity and all that.

72
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,100
Give us the bearded dwarves.

73
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,060
Do female dwarves have beards?

74
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,060
Eh?

75
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,060
Yes.

76
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
Yes.

77
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,940
No, of course they don't, they're female, aren't they?

78
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,880
You know, when Naomi and I sat down and watched season two of The Witcher, we were actually

79
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,540
a bit surprised and then delighted that they put in bearded female dwarves in that show.

80
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,880
It seemed like something that Hollywood never had the balls to do, and yet they did it.

81
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
It was cool.

82
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,980
And notice in the shot how nobody in universe makes a big deal about it.

83
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,300
She's just there doing her thing like it's normal.

84
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,860
That shot is for the fans to notice and react to.

85
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,860
Like we did.

86
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,860
In case it's not obvious yet.

87
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,300
The new Lord of the Rings show is not for fans.

88
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,640
Next up is the black elf.

89
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,640
And okay, I get it.

90
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
It's a black elf.

91
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Just like the black dwarf.

92
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Fine.

93
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,900
We can have different skin colors of these races.

94
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,940
I don't really care.

95
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,740
The issue with the black dwarf isn't that she's black, it's that she doesn't look like

96
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,740
a dwarf.

97
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,780
When the characteristics of black representation collide with the accurate portrayals of lore,

98
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,780
the lore loses.

99
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,920
It's the same with the black elf.

100
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,100
Elves have long hair and they're meant to look otherworldly.

101
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,740
This looks like a regular black guy with spirit Halloween ears.

102
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,300
There are many examples of the dark skinned elf look and fantasy that could have been

103
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
adapted.

104
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,420
Hell, again, even hentai does it better.

105
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:54,280
Probably worst of all is that this character is meant to be a gray elf, a subrace of elves

106
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,060
that is specifically extremely pale.

107
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,060
Actually no.

108
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,620
Worst of all is the fact that the black elf story involves him having a forbidden relationship

109
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,780
with a white human woman upon which he goes off to adventure and she's left as a single

110
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,780
mother.

111
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,780
Man.

112
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,900
Even their ham-fisted attempts at representation backfires into overt racism.

113
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,900
It's just amazing.

114
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,700
We have a similar problem with Elrond.

115
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,020
Yeah, nobody can replace Agent Smith, but that's just the nature of working with real

116
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,100
actors who age.

117
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,900
The problem is, he looks like a human wearing plastic ears again.

118
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,700
The clothes, the hair, it just doesn't look right.

119
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,940
This isn't Star Trek.

120
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,040
Elves are not just another race like the Vulcans are to humans in that universe.

121
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,180
Elves are supposed to be wholly separate from the mortal races and should appear as such.

122
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,100
There's other dumb stuff too, like the nomadic wanderers having giant antlers on their backs

123
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,220
for no reason other than it looks, uh, I was going to say looks cool, but it's not cool.

124
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,220
It looks different.

125
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,500
I mean, it makes you notice it, but for all the wrong reasons, it's just dumb.

126
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,900
These guys aren't main characters or anything, so it's just a throwaway moment where they

127
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,900
appear for a few seconds to set the tone of the series, but it just looks really stupid.

128
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,900
If you guys are nomadic hunters, why are you wearing giant antlers on your back that might

129
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,100
make say a bear or a lion or a wolf think that you are their prey from far away?

130
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,460
It's literally the opposite of camouflage.

131
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,340
These scenes look genuinely awful.

132
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,300
Even disregarding the lore stuff, the production value isn't good, certainly not one billion

133
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
dollars good.

134
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,020
It looks like a generic fantasy ripoff show that some mid-tier TV channel like FX or something

135
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,420
would make, only for it to be forgotten about a few weeks after it drops.

136
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,860
But because it has the Lord of the Rings name slapped on it, people will keep talking about

137
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,180
this shit for years, like it's somehow a cultural phenomenon, branding all of its detractors

138
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,620
as misogynists, because clearly the only reason anyone would hate it is because it got strong

139
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,660
female leads.

140
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,460
And when it inevitably ends, it will be remembered as another dire warning, another corpse atop

141
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,780
a mountain of corpses of formerly beloved franchises that corpos suck the life out of

142
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,740
in the name of diversity, inclusion, and equity.

143
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,860
Listen kid, if it took this abomination for you to finally feel fucking seen, you're not

144
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,060
actually a black person, you're fucking transparent.

145
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,060
Just in case you thought, oh maybe it's just the set design, maybe it's the costume, maybe

146
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,540
it's just the casting, maybe the script will be good.

147
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:04,140
Well, part of the script was leaked, just one little sequence, and it is fucking awful.

148
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,820
I don't care.

149
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,940
They say that you're under his spell.

150
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,220
You can't be trusted, because you're too lonely and lovesick to know any better.

151
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,460
Well you know, it won't be easy for me to drag you from this house, but I'll do it.

152
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,700
Why should they trust you?

153
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,860
Trust either of us.

154
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,780
We don't even trust each other.

155
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,180
I trust you.

156
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,180
No you don't.

157
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:33,580
You're too afraid I'll end up like father, gone.

158
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,580
Oh my god.

159
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,580
Oh my god.

160
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,100
I can't wait to go out tonight and get fucked.

161
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,900
Yeah, it reads like it's out of something like a Degrassi teen drama show.

162
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,260
And by the way, when I say the phrase, when it ends, don't hold your breath, because Amazon's

163
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,220
paid for five seasons of this garbage.

164
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,620
It hasn't even come out yet, and it's a billion dollars, five seasons, on a show that looks

165
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,980
this ass, that despite everything will probably still make them money disappointingly, all

166
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,000
because Amazon wants to secure the Lord of the Rings brand for themselves.

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,120
Christopher Tolkien, J.R.R. Tolkien's son, died on January 16th, 2020.

168
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,560
Christopher was well known for relentlessly safeguarding, we may even say gatekeeping,

169
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,000
the Lord of the Rings property from corrupting influences.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,920
The original movies were not perfect, but they were as good as they were, in part, because

171
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,720
of the Tolkien estate's insistence on accuracy.

172
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,040
On August 31st, 2017, Christopher resigned as the head of the estate, wanting to live

173
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,120
out his remaining years in retirement.

174
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,080
Afterward, while other Tolkien family members remained involved in the running of the estate,

175
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,080
a new legal entity became its main solicitor, Meyer Blackburn LLC.

176
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,920
That company has two partners, Stephen Andrew Meyer and Kathleen Blackburn, both of whom

177
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,640
were lawyers for the estate under Christopher.

178
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,840
And by the 13th of November, 2017, less than two months after Christopher retired, Amazon

179
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,720
had purchased the TV rights to the property for 250 million dollars.

180
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm not outlining all this to say that Meyer and Blackburn somehow stole the Tolkien estate

181
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,320
away from the Tolkien family and how horrendous an injustice it is or something like that,

182
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,640
there's truly no way to know.

183
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,280
The only thing I'm saying is, after the director of the estate became somebody who was not

184
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,720
a member of the Tolkien family, the TV rights to the Lord of the Rings were sold to Amazon.

185
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,820
I'm sure they made a shit ton of money on it, I'm sure the surviving Tolkien's also

186
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,460
got their cut too, but this is what happens when control of these properties transfers

187
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,460
from a creator to a corporation, and the entertainment media is in on it.

188
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,920
They know what steps have to be taken next to make this go over as smoothly as possible.

189
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,900
They know it's time to sideline the Tolkien component of Lord of the Rings in order to

190
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,700
privilege what's currently being made.

191
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
L.O.T.R.

192
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,620
The Rings of Power's new non-Tolkien elf and dwarf character details.

193
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,580
Yeah, that little phrase is why we know it's shit.

194
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,180
You know, you can actually write new lore, as long as it's in line with old lore.

195
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,220
It doesn't need to be written by Tolkien, but it has to be in the style of Tolkien.

196
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,120
Holding up non-Tolkien as a selling point is exactly the thing that you don't want

197
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,600
to see here as a fan.

198
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,860
New images from the Rings of Power show us a side of Middle Earth ignored by Tolkien

199
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
and Jackson.

200
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,600
It's not ignored by Tolkien if Tolkien didn't write it.

201
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,940
That means it doesn't exist, it's a fictional world.

202
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,860
If the creator didn't write a thing, that doesn't mean that he ignored it, that means

203
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,520
it was not actually created.

204
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,320
It felt only natural to us that an adaptation of Tolkien's work would reflect what the

205
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,120
world actually looks like.

206
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,160
Tolkien is for everyone.

207
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
It's a fictional world.

208
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,280
It looks like what Tolkien wrote, and Tolkien is not for non-Tolkien fans.

209
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
As simple as that.

210
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,760
It's the height of arrogance to take a property and claim that its original creator failed

211
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,780
to spotlight a component of it by not creating it in the first place.

212
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,240
Can we come up with a novel Tolkien never wrote and do it as the mega event series that

213
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,680
can only happen now?

214
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Again, height of arrogance.

215
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,360
These people are not acting like the inheritors, the stewards of the property they've been

216
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,440
given, to organically grow a new component out of.

217
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,020
They're acting like L.O.T.R. is an empty bottle that can be filled with whatever the holder

218
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,400
wants to put in it, even if the liquid they choose is diarrhea.

219
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,280
When you treat a property like that, you will rapidly find that nobody actually wants to

220
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
drink it.

221
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,380
This quote, by Tolkien, has been floating around ever since this series was announced.

222
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,280
Evil cannot create anything new, they can only corrupt and ruin what good forces have

223
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,360
invented or made.

224
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,860
The quote was spammed on the Rings of Power's trailer so much until Amazon began to censor

225
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,420
the phrase, so now it's just being reposted in a bunch of different languages.

226
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,100
But here's a more important quote.

227
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,480
Peter Jackson, in 2002, there are certainly themes Tolkien felt were important.

228
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,640
We made a promise to ourselves at the beginning of the process that we weren't going to

229
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,140
put any of our own politics, our own messages, or our own themes into these movies.

230
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,780
What we were trying to do was analyze what was important to Tolkien and try to honor

231
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,780
that.

232
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,940
In a way, we were trying to make these films for him, not for us.

233
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,340
This is the ideal.

234
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,800
Make the movie for people who appreciate Tolkien, not for everyone, because if it's for everyone,

235
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
it's going to be shit.

236
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,160
If it's something to be interesting enough to be good, those qualities that make it stand

237
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,040
out have to also be interesting enough for it to be bad to somebody else.

238
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,840
If it's for everyone, then it's just unexciting and bland.

239
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,800
And although nobody's palette will be offended, nobody will actually care.

240
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,720
In my Whoopi Goldberg video, I made an error about what Gina Serrano said that got her

241
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,000
axe from the Mandalorian.

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,720
What she actually posted was this,

243
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,480
Jews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors, even by children.

244
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,140
Because history is edited, most people today don't realize that to get to the point where

245
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,360
Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own

246
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,020
neighbors hate them for simply being Jews.

247
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,440
How is that any different for hating someone for their political views?

248
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,500
And this post was enough for her to lose that Mandalorian spot.

249
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,140
People screamed bloody murder that she no longer deserved to represent such an honored

250
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,060
cultural hallmark as Star Wars for things that she said off-show on social media.

251
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,860
Almost as if the character of Cara Dune was an office that somebody held, in the institution

252
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,120
that is Star Wars, and not an acting job in a sci-fi show.

253
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,980
When I talked about consumption as representation, I was describing the merger of leftist politics

254
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,320
where representation always matters, and matters the most, with the corporate desire to position

255
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,780
every brand as more than just entertainment, but an essential cultural phenomenon through

256
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,640
which people filter their daily experiences through.

257
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,640
The natural end result of this amalgamation is a quasi-religious reverence for popular

258
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
properties.

259
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,880
Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, Ghostbusters, whatever.

260
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,720
It was always this way for the mega-fans of the past, sure.

261
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,760
We always had Trekkies or Nintendrones.

262
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,320
But this attitude has moved outside of that insular sphere, and has now become the wider

263
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
culture.

264
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,000
These properties have stopped being added to organically by caring stewards, and have

265
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,920
instead become the empty jar that can be filled with the desires of whoever happens to buy

266
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,920
it.

267
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,160
And yet, everyone expects the fans to treat the property like it's the former, and not

268
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
the latter.

269
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Here's an example of what I mean.

270
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,920
When Christopher Nolan announced that Batman Begins would be a new take, and not continuing

271
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,000
the most recent movie Batman lore, people generally didn't care, partially because

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,680
the last few movies sucked ass, but also because the new continuity wasn't going

273
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,900
to take away from the total canon, but instead add to it.

274
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,000
It wasn't demanding that this is the story now, it was offering another interpretation,

275
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
among many.

276
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,320
It was the next growth on the vine, the next brick placed on the wall.

277
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,260
It wasn't destroying everything and starting from scratch.

278
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:07,800
But now that these things aren't just entertainment, but they're cultural institutions, the actors

279
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,640
and actresses who are cast into these roles are representatives of the proper politics,

280
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,040
and need to act accordingly, unless they want to be treated like Gina Serrano.

281
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,960
It's not just that Serrano said what she said, it's that she said it while inhabiting the

282
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,680
illustrious position of Cara Dune.

283
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,680
An equivalent to fantasy failure is the new Game of Thrones show, which features a black

284
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,300
Valyrian, a race of people who are pale skinned with purple eyes, because why the fuck not.

285
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,320
Also Matt Smith looks awful, Jesus Christ.

286
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,160
The point I'm getting at, is you can look at any of the images I'm displaying on screen

287
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,400
right now, and find a hundred problems with them, whether that's lore problems or quality

288
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
problems.

289
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,600
You can't actually object to those problems, because the corporations that run the show

290
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,220
are positioning these properties as not just entertainment, but as institutions, essential

291
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,240
components of our cultural tapestry.

292
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,600
And because another component of that tapestry is diversity, inclusion, equity.

293
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,040
When you criticize the shows, you're criticizing the institutions, and when you criticize the

294
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,960
institutions, you're criticizing the politics.

295
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,380
That's how they've set this up.

296
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,160
It's not only that if the stewards of these properties are willing to change lore, then

297
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,800
they're willing to change other things to shoehorn a political message.

298
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,880
That certainly happens, but that's surface level.

299
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,280
What's deeper, is that your objection to being fed this sludge, is considered an objection

300
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,840
to the political message that comes with it.

301
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,120
So even if you're a leftoid who just happens to also have an eye for film quality, if you

302
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,400
object, you're a filthy reactionary trump-tard fascist.

303
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,000
So fuck it, we all know it's going to be shit, and we all know exactly what the corpos, the

304
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,040
media, and the progs are going to say about our objections as they march in lockstep.

305
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,640
So I'm just going to have fun with it.

306
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,440
After the shit show that was Santa Inc, I stopped caring if smoothbrands on the internet

307
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,480
thought it was a fascism to object to having someone directly shit down the cable into

308
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
your TV.

309
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,600
The rings of power looks like an unmitigated disaster, and I can't wait to pirate the fuck

310
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,160
out of it and turn it into a review for my channel, because that's all it's worth.

311
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,560
OMG, like, I totes don't care.

312
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,160
They say you're under a spell, you can't be trusted, because you're too lonely and

313
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,640
lovesick to know any better.

314
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,720
I feel like totes won't be easy for me to, like, drag you from this house, but I'll,

315
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,040
like, totally do it.

316
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,360
Why should they trust you?

317
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,440
Trust either of us, we don't even trust each other!

318
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,680
I, like, totes trust you, babe.

319
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
No you don't!

320
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,240
You're too afraid, and I'm like, father, gahhh!

321
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,520
Bitch.
