1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
This is something I've hinted at here and there, on streams and on other videos I've done,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,440
but I figure it's probably about time I did a full thing on it.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,440
Before I did the political videos, before I made Learn to Code, or MasterCard as the final boss,

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,920
or the Sargon Guest Spot, or the Total Biscuit Traps video,

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,560
before gamergate, this channel did anime reviews back in 2009,

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,480
and we also started doing gaming playthroughs around 2012.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,240
That stuff's still up on my side channels by the way, if you're interested in seeing it.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,200
But my point is, I was largely apolitical, and I travelled in apolitical circles.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,400
Myself, and the two other people who ran this channel at the time,

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,640
we had peers and friendships with some of the other small time anime and let's play

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,040
youtubers out there. I was just your generic free speech center lefty kinda guy,

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,680
which seems to be the default setting for the non-politically inclined in western countries.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,640
Gamergate changed that for me and for a lot of other people.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,720
I really think that was the point in which your average mid-twenty-something person

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,280
learned that the establishment they, by default, supported as an apolitical actor,

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,320
did not actually have their back the way they thought.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,480
I think that's why the overwhelming opinion on the radical left now is that gamers are

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,320
a right-wing group, even though the politics of gamers haven't really changed.

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,800
Gamers have just realized that they've largely been abandoned by an enthusiast press that was

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,320
supposed to stick up for them when the conservative-leaning Jack Thompson

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,280
video games cause school shootings types show up.

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,480
In my opinion, this is also why these people think that gamergate caused Trump and Brexit,

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,440
because gamergate was the first real pushback against the ideological encroachment of the left,

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,040
even if it was only contained within the specific subculture of gaming.

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,960
It's probably more accurate to say that the mindset that caused gamergate is the mindset

26
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,680
that caused Trump and Brexit, and that mindset would basically be a willingness to oppose the

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,080
tyranny of social justice at every turn.

28
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,440
But since gamergate was the first noteworthy opposition of the hegemon, everything is gamergate.

29
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,640
I titled this video Who I Miss, because in opposing the hegemon, in questioning social

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,000
justice rather than simply believing it, in not becoming more radical over time with my peers,

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,880
I found that a lot of people turned on me quite quickly.

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,960
I haven't even changed that much, not really.

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,920
But because the Overton window has shifted so far to the left,

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,560
and my colleagues have shifted so far to the left with it,

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,680
to them I looked like an alt-right nazi or whatever, because I refuse to move from the

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,560
center, and although I have a great online friend group now that I wouldn't trade in for anything,

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,200
and I have a great community in my discord who are always amazing pals to hang out with,

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,760
I can't help but wonder why everything went so wrong with the people that I used to run with.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,400
It's my guess that if you're even watching this video,

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,560
you've probably lost some friends or family members to Trump Derangement Syndrome.

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,680
I'm not even a die-hard Trump fan, but because I don't think he's Satan, I guess I'm Satan now.

42
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,880
Here's an example of what I mean.

43
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,240
I made a video about Charlottesville back in 2017,

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,520
titled The Moral Equivalence Between the Alt-Right and Antifa.

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,200
In it, I spoke about two people that I really looked up to from the Let's Play days,

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Casey of Born Losers Gaming and Rick from The D-Pad.

47
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,080
I knew them to be reasonable people, and I figured that I could politely disagree with them.

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,800
I devoted part of the video replying to some of their tweets,

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,480
and saying what I think they got wrong, and they both blocked me for it.

50
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,680
But it's not just them.

51
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Blacklightattack, who I both looked up to and was once friends with,

52
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,440
created what I think was the first ever Let's Play of a Pokemon Nuzlocke game back in 2011.

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,600
Up until him, the Nuzlocke format had been confined to comics and stories,

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,840
but he was the first to try to do it in a Let's Play.

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,880
And not only did his Nuzlocke of Pokemon Leaf Green

56
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,720
become the number one search result for Pokemon on YouTube at that time,

57
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,440
it also included a lot of edgy jokes that his social justice-aligned current self

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
would most certainly not approve of.

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,600
And of course, there's Spoonie, the guy that inspired the three of us

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,800
to even start doing anime reviews a decade ago in the first place.

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,000
I told the story of our almost crossover with him in a previous video,

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,480
but the short version is, Nicole set it up with him,

63
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,360
we co-wrote a script with him for Tekken The Motion Picture,

64
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
we were set to shoot it at Con Bravo,

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
but Channel Awesome told him at the last minute

66
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,280
that he couldn't crossover with people not on That Guy With The Glasses anymore.

67
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,120
This event was one of the many seeds that caused their split years later.

68
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,360
But Spoonie's videos had no problem embracing the edgy humor of the early 2000s.

69
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:17,520
Even as he morphed into a complete SJW cuck later on.

70
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,080
In fact, it's telling just how many of the angry reviewers of Internet yesteryear

71
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,240
turned out to be complete losers.

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,040
How can you possibly be pro-political correctness,

73
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,720
pro-censorship SJWs when you built your brands on being

74
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,040
irrationally angry at games and movies?

75
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,600
Watching these people rail on about angry gamers or Trump supporters or whatever

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,640
just screams to me that they no longer desire or value what little relevance they still have.

77
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
And it's not just creators either.

78
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,600
If you are a YouTuber or whatever and you're watching this video,

79
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,760
how many of you have lost a viewer or a fan because of a political stance you took?

80
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,200
Or even worse, because you refuse to take a stance?

81
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,240
I know I have.

82
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
Just off the top of my head,

83
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,920
Relan Serrano, one of my oldest viewers,

84
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,440
tried to get my Patreon taken down back when Patreon was relevant.

85
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,160
I can remember many old commenters on the anime reviews

86
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
turning around and telling me that I was a bigot

87
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,640
because I reacted to the gaming industry's immense corruption by supporting Gamergate.

88
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,680
Regardless of the facts,

89
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,000
Gamergate was just about misogyny and that was it.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
We can also throw Blaster Nation onto this pile,

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,880
though this one people might not know quite as well.

92
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Brad Brown writes the social justice-y porn comic Rockcocks,

93
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,960
which he abandoned the vastly superior webcomic Blaster Nation for.

94
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,640
He still kept the Twitter name though.

95
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,640
And speaking of his Twitter, let's check it out.

96
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,000
I loved Catherine and was hoping this remake would fix the one

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,880
huge glaring issue with Erika's representation,

98
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,120
but instead they made it far, far worse across two characters now.

99
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Fuck this series and this director.

100
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,840
Throwing my special edition box in the trash.

101
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,720
I refuse to play Persona 5 now out of principle.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,200
I regret the time I spent playing Persona 3 and 4 thinking this shit would get better.

103
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,120
And I regret buying Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's season pass now.

104
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
I will not be touching Joker at all.

105
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,880
Fuck Katsura Hashino.

106
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,440
I'm also seeing a lot of UGG Japan posts about this and no, stop.

107
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,800
This is Katsura Hashino.

108
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,880
Yeah, there's a lot of shitheads like him there,

109
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,160
just as there is in every nation, including mine and yours,

110
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,240
but don't negate the great work of Japanese creators pushing positive LGBT plus representation.

111
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,000
So Blaster Nation, Brad Brown, the same man that wrote that three tweet wine?

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,200
That's Donkey Kong, 4chan's V. Tripfag.

113
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,080
Yeah, this guy.

114
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,480
His threads still float around 12 years later.

115
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,600
Oh, give me a break.

116
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,040
I have to choose between being a fag or having a tiny dick.

117
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,440
Of course I'm going to fight against both choices.

118
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,280
Really, Brad, I have my pronouns in my Twitter bio, Brown.

119
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,200
Being a fag is bad, eh?

120
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,080
I see.

121
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,720
Donkey Kong, V's very own epic fail guy, etc, etc.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,600
He also made some faggot album that nobody downloaded.

123
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,760
Oh yeah, DK's album.

124
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,840
The V albums are just a series of good video game songs and remixes

125
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,240
slapped together semi-regularly by the community.

126
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,040
But he did the first one and he inspired the later V the musicals and whatever.

127
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,760
Unfortunately, his original album was lost to time,

128
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,440
but I remember it being filled with some pretty problematic stuff.

129
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,680
For example, a stereotypically Asian accented voice that Brad put on

130
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,360
where he played Sakurai, the game dev of Smash Brothers.

131
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
Geez, let's hope that never resurfaces

132
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,960
or he'll be seriously dragged on social media by his new friends.

133
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,160
But Brad isn't blind to this change that he's underwent.

134
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,760
Just a few days ago, Hbomberguy put out a video on companies and brands

135
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,760
capitalizing on progressive values

136
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,360
and promoting themselves through manufactured outrage with alt-right types.

137
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,520
And how easily that can swing the other way.

138
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,200
Today, THQ Nordic is hosting an AMA on 8chan.

139
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,880
Didn't you used to answer questions in Blaster Nation threads on 4chan?

140
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,520
I did, sure. Seven years ago, when 4chan was a much different place

141
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,120
and I was a much worse person.

142
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,040
It's not something I would do today.

143
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,960
Or something I would do as the PR person of a major video games publisher

144
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,800
on an infinitely worse website delisted from Google for child pornography.

145
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Hold up, this doesn't feel right.

146
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,960
When you say when 4chan was a different place,

147
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,080
considering the context of how you feel about the chans now,

148
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,080
it seems like you're saying 4chan was better back then than it is now.

149
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,760
And you're also saying that you were a worse person back when you were DK

150
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,480
using this website back when it was better?

151
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
So clearly it's not the chans that made you bad, whatever bad is.

152
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,440
I don't know, this message just feels like the panicked deflection

153
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,600
of a guy who understands that his SJW peers will throw him under the bus

154
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,840
at even a hint, a whiff of sin, even if it's 12 years old.

155
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,000
Uh, 4chan wasn't so bad back then.

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,400
Also, I've gotten a lot better. I wouldn't do it now.

157
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,720
Also, I wasn't a PR person for a studio.

158
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,400
Please don't excommunicate me.

159
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,360
It seems like this sort of thing has happened to everyone, you know?

160
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,760
People I knew personally, people I looked up to,

161
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
people who looked up to me, it doesn't matter.

162
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
I can still find examples of all of them being edgy shits

163
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,520
on 4chan or Newgrounds or whatever back in 2009,

164
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,760
but nowadays they're virtue signaling on Twitter,

165
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,840
creating sterile politically correct content

166
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,160
that slowly alienates what's left of their fanbase,

167
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,360
and desperately trying to scrub the collective internet consciousness

168
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,280
whenever their old misdeeds resurface, lest they be dragged on social media.

169
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,560
I'm sure we all remember the early Game Grumps racial epithets,

170
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,000
but just look at Aaron now.

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,680
It's almost as if he's been neutered.

172
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,040
Along with this leftward shift, the derangement syndrome,

173
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,400
the abandoning of old contacts refusing to radicalize,

174
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,760
and the disavowal of their less-than-stellar pasts,

175
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,080
these people also seem to embrace a heavily amplified social media presence

176
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,200
in lieu of actually creating the content they were known for.

177
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,720
Everybody at this point knows about Spoonie's legendary downfall

178
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,760
from YouTube titan to 18 hour a day Twitter complainer,

179
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,960
but it's not just him.

180
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,920
Black Light Attack moved out to San Francisco to work for Twitch,

181
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,040
but he couldn't hold the job down because he couldn't wake up on time.

182
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,720
He then tried to make it as a streamer,

183
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,440
but eventually gave that up because he couldn't keep a schedule,

184
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,000
and last I heard, he's moved back to his hometown.

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,360
The people who ran Born Losers Gaming were probably the most talented,

186
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,080
small let's players I've ever seen anywhere.

187
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,960
One of them simply moved on and started his adult life.

188
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,760
The other one occasionally makes promises of returning,

189
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,920
but seems to be spending most of his time hosting local Smash Bros tournaments,

190
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,560
and slowly becoming more radicalized over time

191
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,040
as he progresses through his English literature degree.

192
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
And I'm not happy to say this, man.

193
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,080
These people were my friends.

194
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,560
These people showed genuine promise and talent,

195
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,440
but they got sucked into their politics to the point that they now think

196
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,800
it's a moral good to shun people who don't think like they do.

197
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
And you know what?

198
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
On the off chance this video gets popular and hits the SJW crowd,

199
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,680
and the moral outrage mob comes for any of the individuals I've talked about,

200
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,960
you want to know what they'll do?

201
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,400
Make excuses about their past, talk about how terrible I am,

202
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,800
and declare that they never really liked me to begin with.

203
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,680
It's what Rick from The D-Pad did when they came for him.

204
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,160
I've always been under the impression that the average person turns more conservative over time,

205
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,160
not more radically left to the point that they self-censor and censor others

206
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,040
and stop associating with those that social justice has deemed undesirable.

207
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,680
I don't know, maybe people just turn more authoritarian as they age rather than conservative.

208
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,800
And because leftist authoritarianism is all the rage right now,

209
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,320
that's where all these people are going.

210
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,120
You might say, hey, maybe it's you, Dev.

211
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,160
And maybe it is.

212
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,720
Maybe I'm the delusional one.

213
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,880
Maybe everyone else is the same as they were and I've radicalized into the alt-right.

214
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,840
It's possible.

215
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,600
I mean, my considering the possibility that I've radicalized rightward,

216
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,840
when they would never consider the possibility that they've radicalized leftward,

217
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,320
might tip you off that it's not me, but whatever.

218
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,280
How about this though?

219
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,920
When I stream on Twitch, one of the guys I sometimes do it with is named Jordan.

220
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,280
Jordan's a good guy, friend of mine.

221
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,160
I appreciate his company, but we are very politically different.

222
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,800
The people on Twitch chat and Discord have jokingly given him the name of The Commie,

223
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,160
because he's about as close to an actual communist as I've ever met IRL.

224
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,120
And you know what?

225
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,240
We're still friends.

226
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,280
We co-exist.

227
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,760
I'm completely fine with being pals with people who have radically different worldviews than I do.

228
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,200
As long as they're not violent, fine, it makes conversations interesting.

229
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,400
And Jordan's a good guy.

230
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,480
If I actually were the radical ideologue,

231
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,680
would I really be chillin' with somebody I directly oppose politically?

232
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,280
And Jordan's moving to Venezuela to experience the true communism.

233
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,360
What if Swalin isn't true communism?

234
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,280
Is this a bunch of Cuck communism coming from Cuba?

235
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,560
It's true socialism.

236
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,720
Yeah, it's bad socialism too.

237
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,720
The only kind.

238
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,800
Hey Jordan, I'm gonna start calling you Jordan B. Peterborough.

239
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,080
Jordan B. Peterborough?

240
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,400
Great, now I have to like end my life off your roof.

241
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,280
This has been a pretty self-indulgent video so far, huh?

242
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,120
Well, if it's bored you, I'm sorry.

243
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,080
I think the pattern I've fallen into with my uploads recently

244
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,480
is that when I talk about a specific situation,

245
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,000
I end with a generalized rule we can extract from the situation.

246
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,840
A bit of wisdom about what's going on.

247
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,240
And if you're looking for that, then here it is.

248
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,320
In one of the weekly sips a little while ago,

249
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,560
I described a kid who was being punished by his university for his political beliefs.

250
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,720
My advice to him in that video was to suck it up, hide his beliefs,

251
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,280
get through school, get a job, get out of there.

252
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,440
I now disagree with that advice.

253
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,200
Firstly, if it's bad in the school system,

254
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,880
it's gonna be worse when you get a real job

255
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,240
with stuff like nannying HR departments and diversity training.

256
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,000
Wherever you are, if you truly believe you're right, make your stand there.

257
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,480
It might be costly, but that cost doesn't decrease from waiting.

258
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,080
So you might as well do it now.

259
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,600
But more importantly than that,

260
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
when you run from what you're supposed to confront,

261
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,360
you diminish yourself a little bit and the challenge grows a little bit.

262
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,440
I think we all know this intrinsically.

263
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,320
For example, when you get a bill in the mail, it might be annoying.

264
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,240
But the best thing to do is pay it off.

265
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,280
That bill isn't just a piece of paper sitting in your mailbox.

266
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,120
It's attached to social mechanisms meant to compel you to pay your bills.

267
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,440
So if you let it sit behind your computer monitor

268
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,760
on the bottom of a stack of papers for three years,

269
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,240
not only is the amount you owe going to triple,

270
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,360
but you're going to have other people appearing at your place physically

271
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,240
to get you to pay it or take you away for not paying it,

272
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,520
depending on the circumstance.

273
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,480
But this process happens internally, not just externally.

274
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,400
We know that fears grow stronger and you grow weaker when you run from them.

275
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,480
We also know that when you face your fears,

276
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,760
you might not become less afraid, but you do become more resilient.

277
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,560
This is the fundamental problem with safe space culture, by the way.

278
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,280
People who continually retreat into a safe space

279
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,560
never truly learn that they can withstand the threat their fears represent.

280
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,680
And they end up spending their adult lives simpering away,

281
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
waiting for an ever greater authority figure to protect them,

282
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,120
whether that's the school, the corporate structure or the state.

283
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,400
What's important about this is that when you shirk away from the challenge,

284
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,480
you gradually become a part of the problem that you were originally tasked to face.

285
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,920
In other words, when you force yourself to say things you don't believe,

286
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,840
you come to believe the things you say.

287
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,840
This is where I fundamentally disagree with Sargon.

288
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,920
He thinks you can't change what a person believes.

289
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,120
I think you can, but I think it's a very unpleasant business to do so.

290
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,000
We all know that asshole kid in class who started off saying,

291
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,840
well, I'll just write that paper to appeal to my SJW professor and pass the class.

292
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,280
And he ended up becoming the most diehard SJW in the school,

293
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,680
attending rallies, maybe even joining Antifa.

294
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,920
And maybe some of us were that asshole once.

295
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,520
You know what it's like.

296
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,600
You can remember writing the paper.

297
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,800
Your heart's not in it.

298
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,480
You're just regurgitating words.

299
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,680
You're easily distracted.

300
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
You feel diminished while you do it.

301
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,080
But when you're done, you haven't only written the paper.

302
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,160
You've constructed an articulated argument that runs counter to what you actually believe.

303
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,800
And your original convictions remain unarticulated.

304
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,840
In essence, you've constructed your own political opponent inside of you.

305
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,080
And the real you has no chance against it,

306
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,960
because the ideas of the real you remain underdeveloped.

307
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,400
And over time, people begin to believe what they've surrounded themselves with,

308
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,400
because it's a whole lot less painful than admitting to yourself that you're a lying coward.

309
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,640
Maybe this is because of school, like BLG.

310
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,600
Maybe it's because of work, like Black Light Attack.

311
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,760
Maybe it's because of social media echo chambers, like Spoonie or Brad Brown.

312
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,600
But all the people that I've talked about today,

313
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,760
and I think really everyone that's been lost to Trump Derangement Syndrome over time,

314
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,080
the real them, the person they used to be,

315
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,080
back when they were apolitical, productive, and most importantly, happy,

316
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,000
that real them is still there.

317
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,840
But that version of themselves has become so rejected and abused,

318
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,920
that there's a good chance they're never coming back.

319
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,600
When you compromise on your principles,

320
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,320
and I don't mean in some small way to meet in the middle,

321
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,880
I mean when you compromise your entire character in order to curry favor with an authority,

322
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,680
you do something akin to shredding your soul.

323
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,520
I don't believe in souls, but you know what I mean.

324
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
You demolish a vital part of yourself.

325
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,680
You dispose with what keeps you grounded.

326
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,400
But even though it really sounds like it, it's not all doom and gloom.

327
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,800
Whenever you listen to a self-help person, like a Mel Robbins or Les Brown or whatever,

328
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,920
they always talk about the power of faith and self-actualization,

329
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,800
the ability to desire something from the bottom of your soul,

330
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,880
aim at it, and achieve it through hard work.

331
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,920
What any motivational speech describes is the inverse of what I'm talking about here.

332
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,120
When you stand up for your convictions, even in the face of authority,

333
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,760
you may pay a worldly price for it, a hefty price even, but you grow stronger.

334
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,080
The indescribable part of you that's in the core of your being grows rather than dies.

335
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,240
It's a fertilizing of the human spirit.

336
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,200
This is a bit too much hippie bullshit for you, isn't it?

337
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Well, here's something concrete.

338
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,480
At least, concrete in the best layman's terms that I can put.

339
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,440
The neural pathways in our brain that manage imagination,

340
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,600
and the neural pathways in our brain that manage memory, are linked quite strongly.

341
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,680
Meaning when you're forced to say or do or think something you don't believe,

342
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,040
you break yourself down.

343
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,200
But when you visualize something that you truly do believe in, you build yourself up.

344
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,920
If there's ever been a reason that I oppose social justice warriors, then it is this.

345
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,760
They don't just want your compliance.

346
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,600
They don't just want your behaviors.

347
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
They want your thoughts, your minds.

348
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,880
I have seen people I consider to be far greater than me

349
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,920
become diminished beyond belief by their compliance.

350
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,520
By their, I'll just do it once and then it'll be okay attitude.

351
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,080
Like an alcoholic or a drug addict or something.

352
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,760
And now their personalities are completely subsumed by their politics.

353
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,360
Just like an addict's personality is completely subsumed by the addiction.

354
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,640
That will never be me.

355
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,680
And I hope it is never you too.
