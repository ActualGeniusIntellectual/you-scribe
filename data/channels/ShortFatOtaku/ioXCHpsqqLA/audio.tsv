0	4640	This is something I've hinted at here and there, on streams and on other videos I've done,
4640	7440	but I figure it's probably about time I did a full thing on it.
7440	13440	Before I did the political videos, before I made Learn to Code, or MasterCard as the final boss,
13440	17920	or the Sargon Guest Spot, or the Total Biscuit Traps video,
17920	22560	before gamergate, this channel did anime reviews back in 2009,
22560	26480	and we also started doing gaming playthroughs around 2012.
26480	30240	That stuff's still up on my side channels by the way, if you're interested in seeing it.
30240	35200	But my point is, I was largely apolitical, and I travelled in apolitical circles.
35200	38400	Myself, and the two other people who ran this channel at the time,
38400	42640	we had peers and friendships with some of the other small time anime and let's play
42640	47040	youtubers out there. I was just your generic free speech center lefty kinda guy,
47040	51680	which seems to be the default setting for the non-politically inclined in western countries.
51680	54640	Gamergate changed that for me and for a lot of other people.
54640	58720	I really think that was the point in which your average mid-twenty-something person
58720	63280	learned that the establishment they, by default, supported as an apolitical actor,
63280	66320	did not actually have their back the way they thought.
66320	70480	I think that's why the overwhelming opinion on the radical left now is that gamers are
70480	74320	a right-wing group, even though the politics of gamers haven't really changed.
74320	78800	Gamers have just realized that they've largely been abandoned by an enthusiast press that was
78800	82320	supposed to stick up for them when the conservative-leaning Jack Thompson
82320	85280	video games cause school shootings types show up.
85280	90480	In my opinion, this is also why these people think that gamergate caused Trump and Brexit,
90480	95440	because gamergate was the first real pushback against the ideological encroachment of the left,
95440	99040	even if it was only contained within the specific subculture of gaming.
99040	102960	It's probably more accurate to say that the mindset that caused gamergate is the mindset
102960	107680	that caused Trump and Brexit, and that mindset would basically be a willingness to oppose the
107760	110080	tyranny of social justice at every turn.
110080	115440	But since gamergate was the first noteworthy opposition of the hegemon, everything is gamergate.
115440	120640	I titled this video Who I Miss, because in opposing the hegemon, in questioning social
120640	126000	justice rather than simply believing it, in not becoming more radical over time with my peers,
126000	128880	I found that a lot of people turned on me quite quickly.
128880	130960	I haven't even changed that much, not really.
130960	133920	But because the Overton window has shifted so far to the left,
133920	136560	and my colleagues have shifted so far to the left with it,
136560	141680	to them I looked like an alt-right nazi or whatever, because I refuse to move from the
141680	146560	center, and although I have a great online friend group now that I wouldn't trade in for anything,
146560	151200	and I have a great community in my discord who are always amazing pals to hang out with,
151200	155760	I can't help but wonder why everything went so wrong with the people that I used to run with.
155760	158400	It's my guess that if you're even watching this video,
158400	162560	you've probably lost some friends or family members to Trump Derangement Syndrome.
162560	167680	I'm not even a die-hard Trump fan, but because I don't think he's Satan, I guess I'm Satan now.
167680	168880	Here's an example of what I mean.
169440	172240	I made a video about Charlottesville back in 2017,
172240	175520	titled The Moral Equivalence Between the Alt-Right and Antifa.
175520	179200	In it, I spoke about two people that I really looked up to from the Let's Play days,
179200	182400	Casey of Born Losers Gaming and Rick from The D-Pad.
182400	186080	I knew them to be reasonable people, and I figured that I could politely disagree with them.
186080	188800	I devoted part of the video replying to some of their tweets,
188800	192480	and saying what I think they got wrong, and they both blocked me for it.
192480	193680	But it's not just them.
193680	197680	Blacklightattack, who I both looked up to and was once friends with,
197680	203440	created what I think was the first ever Let's Play of a Pokemon Nuzlocke game back in 2011.
203440	207600	Up until him, the Nuzlocke format had been confined to comics and stories,
207600	209840	but he was the first to try to do it in a Let's Play.
209840	212880	And not only did his Nuzlocke of Pokemon Leaf Green
212880	216720	become the number one search result for Pokemon on YouTube at that time,
216720	221440	it also included a lot of edgy jokes that his social justice-aligned current self
221440	223120	would most certainly not approve of.
252400	255600	And of course, there's Spoonie, the guy that inspired the three of us
255600	258800	to even start doing anime reviews a decade ago in the first place.
258800	262000	I told the story of our almost crossover with him in a previous video,
262000	264480	but the short version is, Nicole set it up with him,
264480	267360	we co-wrote a script with him for Tekken The Motion Picture,
267360	269440	we were set to shoot it at Con Bravo,
269440	271600	but Channel Awesome told him at the last minute
271600	275280	that he couldn't crossover with people not on That Guy With The Glasses anymore.
275280	279120	This event was one of the many seeds that caused their split years later.
279120	283360	But Spoonie's videos had no problem embracing the edgy humor of the early 2000s.
309280	317520	Even as he morphed into a complete SJW cuck later on.
317520	322080	In fact, it's telling just how many of the angry reviewers of Internet yesteryear
322080	324240	turned out to be complete losers.
324240	327040	How can you possibly be pro-political correctness,
327040	330720	pro-censorship SJWs when you built your brands on being
330720	333040	irrationally angry at games and movies?
333040	337600	Watching these people rail on about angry gamers or Trump supporters or whatever
337600	342640	just screams to me that they no longer desire or value what little relevance they still have.
342640	344640	And it's not just creators either.
344640	347600	If you are a YouTuber or whatever and you're watching this video,
347600	351760	how many of you have lost a viewer or a fan because of a political stance you took?
351760	355200	Or even worse, because you refuse to take a stance?
355200	356240	I know I have.
356240	357440	Just off the top of my head,
357440	359920	Relan Serrano, one of my oldest viewers,
359920	363440	tried to get my Patreon taken down back when Patreon was relevant.
363440	366160	I can remember many old commenters on the anime reviews
366160	368160	turning around and telling me that I was a bigot
368160	372640	because I reacted to the gaming industry's immense corruption by supporting Gamergate.
372640	373680	Regardless of the facts,
373680	376000	Gamergate was just about misogyny and that was it.
376000	378560	We can also throw Blaster Nation onto this pile,
378560	380880	though this one people might not know quite as well.
380880	384880	Brad Brown writes the social justice-y porn comic Rockcocks,
384880	388960	which he abandoned the vastly superior webcomic Blaster Nation for.
388960	390640	He still kept the Twitter name though.
390640	392640	And speaking of his Twitter, let's check it out.
392640	396000	I loved Catherine and was hoping this remake would fix the one
396000	398880	huge glaring issue with Erika's representation,
398880	403120	but instead they made it far, far worse across two characters now.
403120	405120	Fuck this series and this director.
405120	407840	Throwing my special edition box in the trash.
407840	410720	I refuse to play Persona 5 now out of principle.
410720	415200	I regret the time I spent playing Persona 3 and 4 thinking this shit would get better.
415200	419120	And I regret buying Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's season pass now.
419120	421360	I will not be touching Joker at all.
421360	422880	Fuck Katsura Hashino.
422880	427440	I'm also seeing a lot of UGG Japan posts about this and no, stop.
427440	428800	This is Katsura Hashino.
428800	430880	Yeah, there's a lot of shitheads like him there,
430880	434160	just as there is in every nation, including mine and yours,
434160	440240	but don't negate the great work of Japanese creators pushing positive LGBT plus representation.
440240	446000	So Blaster Nation, Brad Brown, the same man that wrote that three tweet wine?
446000	449200	That's Donkey Kong, 4chan's V. Tripfag.
449200	450080	Yeah, this guy.
450080	452480	His threads still float around 12 years later.
452480	453600	Oh, give me a break.
453600	457040	I have to choose between being a fag or having a tiny dick.
457040	459440	Of course I'm going to fight against both choices.
459440	463280	Really, Brad, I have my pronouns in my Twitter bio, Brown.
463280	465200	Being a fag is bad, eh?
465200	466080	I see.
466080	470720	Donkey Kong, V's very own epic fail guy, etc, etc.
470720	473600	He also made some faggot album that nobody downloaded.
473600	475760	Oh yeah, DK's album.
475760	479840	The V albums are just a series of good video game songs and remixes
479840	482240	slapped together semi-regularly by the community.
482240	487040	But he did the first one and he inspired the later V the musicals and whatever.
487040	489760	Unfortunately, his original album was lost to time,
489760	493440	but I remember it being filled with some pretty problematic stuff.
493440	497680	For example, a stereotypically Asian accented voice that Brad put on
497680	501360	where he played Sakurai, the game dev of Smash Brothers.
501360	503360	Geez, let's hope that never resurfaces
503360	506960	or he'll be seriously dragged on social media by his new friends.
506960	510160	But Brad isn't blind to this change that he's underwent.
510160	513760	Just a few days ago, Hbomberguy put out a video on companies and brands
513760	515760	capitalizing on progressive values
515760	519360	and promoting themselves through manufactured outrage with alt-right types.
519360	521520	And how easily that can swing the other way.
521520	525200	Today, THQ Nordic is hosting an AMA on 8chan.
525200	528880	Didn't you used to answer questions in Blaster Nation threads on 4chan?
528880	533520	I did, sure. Seven years ago, when 4chan was a much different place
533520	535120	and I was a much worse person.
535120	537040	It's not something I would do today.
537040	540960	Or something I would do as the PR person of a major video games publisher
540960	544800	on an infinitely worse website delisted from Google for child pornography.
544800	546400	Hold up, this doesn't feel right.
546400	548960	When you say when 4chan was a different place,
548960	552080	considering the context of how you feel about the chans now,
552080	556080	it seems like you're saying 4chan was better back then than it is now.
556080	559760	And you're also saying that you were a worse person back when you were DK
559760	562480	using this website back when it was better?
562480	566560	So clearly it's not the chans that made you bad, whatever bad is.
566560	569440	I don't know, this message just feels like the panicked deflection
569440	573600	of a guy who understands that his SJW peers will throw him under the bus
573600	577840	at even a hint, a whiff of sin, even if it's 12 years old.
577840	580000	Uh, 4chan wasn't so bad back then.
580000	582400	Also, I've gotten a lot better. I wouldn't do it now.
582400	584720	Also, I wasn't a PR person for a studio.
584720	586400	Please don't excommunicate me.
586400	589360	It seems like this sort of thing has happened to everyone, you know?
589360	591760	People I knew personally, people I looked up to,
591760	593760	people who looked up to me, it doesn't matter.
593760	596560	I can still find examples of all of them being edgy shits
596560	599520	on 4chan or Newgrounds or whatever back in 2009,
599520	601760	but nowadays they're virtue signaling on Twitter,
601760	603840	creating sterile politically correct content
603840	606160	that slowly alienates what's left of their fanbase,
606160	609360	and desperately trying to scrub the collective internet consciousness
609360	613280	whenever their old misdeeds resurface, lest they be dragged on social media.
613280	616560	I'm sure we all remember the early Game Grumps racial epithets,
616560	618000	but just look at Aaron now.
618000	619680	It's almost as if he's been neutered.
619680	623040	Along with this leftward shift, the derangement syndrome,
623040	626400	the abandoning of old contacts refusing to radicalize,
626400	629760	and the disavowal of their less-than-stellar pasts,
629760	634080	these people also seem to embrace a heavily amplified social media presence
634080	637200	in lieu of actually creating the content they were known for.
637200	640720	Everybody at this point knows about Spoonie's legendary downfall
640720	643760	from YouTube titan to 18 hour a day Twitter complainer,
643760	644960	but it's not just him.
644960	647920	Black Light Attack moved out to San Francisco to work for Twitch,
647920	651040	but he couldn't hold the job down because he couldn't wake up on time.
651040	652720	He then tried to make it as a streamer,
652720	655440	but eventually gave that up because he couldn't keep a schedule,
655440	658000	and last I heard, he's moved back to his hometown.
658000	661360	The people who ran Born Losers Gaming were probably the most talented,
661360	664080	small let's players I've ever seen anywhere.
664080	666960	One of them simply moved on and started his adult life.
666960	669760	The other one occasionally makes promises of returning,
669760	673920	but seems to be spending most of his time hosting local Smash Bros tournaments,
673920	676560	and slowly becoming more radicalized over time
676560	679040	as he progresses through his English literature degree.
679040	680800	And I'm not happy to say this, man.
680800	682080	These people were my friends.
682080	684560	These people showed genuine promise and talent,
684560	687440	but they got sucked into their politics to the point that they now think
687440	690800	it's a moral good to shun people who don't think like they do.
690800	692000	And you know what?
692000	696000	On the off chance this video gets popular and hits the SJW crowd,
696000	699680	and the moral outrage mob comes for any of the individuals I've talked about,
699680	700960	you want to know what they'll do?
700960	704400	Make excuses about their past, talk about how terrible I am,
704400	706800	and declare that they never really liked me to begin with.
706800	709680	It's what Rick from The D-Pad did when they came for him.
709680	714160	I've always been under the impression that the average person turns more conservative over time,
714160	718160	not more radically left to the point that they self-censor and censor others
718160	723040	and stop associating with those that social justice has deemed undesirable.
723040	727680	I don't know, maybe people just turn more authoritarian as they age rather than conservative.
727680	730800	And because leftist authoritarianism is all the rage right now,
730800	732320	that's where all these people are going.
732320	735120	You might say, hey, maybe it's you, Dev.
735120	736160	And maybe it is.
736800	738720	Maybe I'm the delusional one.
738720	742880	Maybe everyone else is the same as they were and I've radicalized into the alt-right.
742880	743840	It's possible.
743840	747600	I mean, my considering the possibility that I've radicalized rightward,
747600	751840	when they would never consider the possibility that they've radicalized leftward,
751840	754320	might tip you off that it's not me, but whatever.
754320	755280	How about this though?
755280	759920	When I stream on Twitch, one of the guys I sometimes do it with is named Jordan.
759920	761280	Jordan's a good guy, friend of mine.
761280	764160	I appreciate his company, but we are very politically different.
764160	768800	The people on Twitch chat and Discord have jokingly given him the name of The Commie,
768800	772160	because he's about as close to an actual communist as I've ever met IRL.
772160	773120	And you know what?
773120	774240	We're still friends.
774240	775280	We co-exist.
775280	779760	I'm completely fine with being pals with people who have radically different worldviews than I do.
779760	783200	As long as they're not violent, fine, it makes conversations interesting.
783200	784400	And Jordan's a good guy.
784400	786480	If I actually were the radical ideologue,
786480	789680	would I really be chillin' with somebody I directly oppose politically?
789680	793280	And Jordan's moving to Venezuela to experience the true communism.
793280	795360	What if Swalin isn't true communism?
795360	797280	Is this a bunch of Cuck communism coming from Cuba?
797280	798560	It's true socialism.
799200	800720	Yeah, it's bad socialism too.
801600	802720	The only kind.
805440	808800	Hey Jordan, I'm gonna start calling you Jordan B. Peterborough.
808800	810080	Jordan B. Peterborough?
810080	812400	Great, now I have to like end my life off your roof.
813840	817280	This has been a pretty self-indulgent video so far, huh?
817280	819120	Well, if it's bored you, I'm sorry.
819120	822080	I think the pattern I've fallen into with my uploads recently
822080	824480	is that when I talk about a specific situation,
824480	828000	I end with a generalized rule we can extract from the situation.
828000	829840	A bit of wisdom about what's going on.
829840	832240	And if you're looking for that, then here it is.
832240	834320	In one of the weekly sips a little while ago,
834320	838560	I described a kid who was being punished by his university for his political beliefs.
838560	842720	My advice to him in that video was to suck it up, hide his beliefs,
842720	845280	get through school, get a job, get out of there.
845280	847440	I now disagree with that advice.
847440	849200	Firstly, if it's bad in the school system,
849200	850880	it's gonna be worse when you get a real job
850880	854240	with stuff like nannying HR departments and diversity training.
854240	858000	Wherever you are, if you truly believe you're right, make your stand there.
858560	862480	It might be costly, but that cost doesn't decrease from waiting.
862480	864080	So you might as well do it now.
864080	865600	But more importantly than that,
865600	867760	when you run from what you're supposed to confront,
867760	871360	you diminish yourself a little bit and the challenge grows a little bit.
871360	873440	I think we all know this intrinsically.
873440	876320	For example, when you get a bill in the mail, it might be annoying.
876320	878240	But the best thing to do is pay it off.
878240	881280	That bill isn't just a piece of paper sitting in your mailbox.
881280	885120	It's attached to social mechanisms meant to compel you to pay your bills.
885120	887440	So if you let it sit behind your computer monitor
887440	889760	on the bottom of a stack of papers for three years,
889760	892240	not only is the amount you owe going to triple,
892240	895360	but you're going to have other people appearing at your place physically
895360	898240	to get you to pay it or take you away for not paying it,
898240	899520	depending on the circumstance.
899520	902480	But this process happens internally, not just externally.
902480	906400	We know that fears grow stronger and you grow weaker when you run from them.
906400	908480	We also know that when you face your fears,
908480	911760	you might not become less afraid, but you do become more resilient.
911760	914560	This is the fundamental problem with safe space culture, by the way.
914560	917280	People who continually retreat into a safe space
917280	920560	never truly learn that they can withstand the threat their fears represent.
920560	923680	And they end up spending their adult lives simpering away,
923680	926480	waiting for an ever greater authority figure to protect them,
926480	929120	whether that's the school, the corporate structure or the state.
929120	932400	What's important about this is that when you shirk away from the challenge,
932400	936480	you gradually become a part of the problem that you were originally tasked to face.
936480	939920	In other words, when you force yourself to say things you don't believe,
939920	941840	you come to believe the things you say.
941840	943840	This is where I fundamentally disagree with Sargon.
943840	945920	He thinks you can't change what a person believes.
945920	949120	I think you can, but I think it's a very unpleasant business to do so.
949120	952000	We all know that asshole kid in class who started off saying,
952000	955840	well, I'll just write that paper to appeal to my SJW professor and pass the class.
955840	959280	And he ended up becoming the most diehard SJW in the school,
959280	961680	attending rallies, maybe even joining Antifa.
961680	963920	And maybe some of us were that asshole once.
964560	965520	You know what it's like.
965520	967600	You can remember writing the paper.
967600	968800	Your heart's not in it.
968800	970480	You're just regurgitating words.
970480	971680	You're easily distracted.
971680	973440	You feel diminished while you do it.
973440	976080	But when you're done, you haven't only written the paper.
976080	980160	You've constructed an articulated argument that runs counter to what you actually believe.
980160	982800	And your original convictions remain unarticulated.
982800	985840	In essence, you've constructed your own political opponent inside of you.
985840	988080	And the real you has no chance against it,
988080	990960	because the ideas of the real you remain underdeveloped.
990960	994400	And over time, people begin to believe what they've surrounded themselves with,
994400	998400	because it's a whole lot less painful than admitting to yourself that you're a lying coward.
998400	1000640	Maybe this is because of school, like BLG.
1001200	1003600	Maybe it's because of work, like Black Light Attack.
1003600	1007760	Maybe it's because of social media echo chambers, like Spoonie or Brad Brown.
1007760	1009600	But all the people that I've talked about today,
1009600	1013760	and I think really everyone that's been lost to Trump Derangement Syndrome over time,
1013760	1016080	the real them, the person they used to be,
1016080	1020080	back when they were apolitical, productive, and most importantly, happy,
1020080	1022000	that real them is still there.
1022000	1025840	But that version of themselves has become so rejected and abused,
1025840	1027920	that there's a good chance they're never coming back.
1027920	1029600	When you compromise on your principles,
1029600	1032320	and I don't mean in some small way to meet in the middle,
1032320	1036880	I mean when you compromise your entire character in order to curry favor with an authority,
1036880	1039680	you do something akin to shredding your soul.
1039680	1041520	I don't believe in souls, but you know what I mean.
1041520	1043520	You demolish a vital part of yourself.
1043520	1045680	You dispose with what keeps you grounded.
1045680	1048400	But even though it really sounds like it, it's not all doom and gloom.
1048400	1052800	Whenever you listen to a self-help person, like a Mel Robbins or Les Brown or whatever,
1052800	1055920	they always talk about the power of faith and self-actualization,
1055920	1058800	the ability to desire something from the bottom of your soul,
1058800	1060880	aim at it, and achieve it through hard work.
1060880	1065920	What any motivational speech describes is the inverse of what I'm talking about here.
1065920	1069120	When you stand up for your convictions, even in the face of authority,
1069120	1073760	you may pay a worldly price for it, a hefty price even, but you grow stronger.
1073760	1078080	The indescribable part of you that's in the core of your being grows rather than dies.
1078080	1080240	It's a fertilizing of the human spirit.
1080240	1083200	This is a bit too much hippie bullshit for you, isn't it?
1083200	1085200	Well, here's something concrete.
1085200	1088480	At least, concrete in the best layman's terms that I can put.
1088480	1091440	The neural pathways in our brain that manage imagination,
1091440	1095600	and the neural pathways in our brain that manage memory, are linked quite strongly.
1095600	1099680	Meaning when you're forced to say or do or think something you don't believe,
1099680	1101040	you break yourself down.
1101120	1105200	But when you visualize something that you truly do believe in, you build yourself up.
1105200	1109920	If there's ever been a reason that I oppose social justice warriors, then it is this.
1109920	1111760	They don't just want your compliance.
1111760	1113600	They don't just want your behaviors.
1113600	1115600	They want your thoughts, your minds.
1115600	1118880	I have seen people I consider to be far greater than me
1118880	1121920	become diminished beyond belief by their compliance.
1121920	1125520	By their, I'll just do it once and then it'll be okay attitude.
1125520	1128080	Like an alcoholic or a drug addict or something.
1128080	1131760	And now their personalities are completely subsumed by their politics.
1131760	1135360	Just like an addict's personality is completely subsumed by the addiction.
1135360	1136640	That will never be me.
1137440	1139680	And I hope it is never you too.
