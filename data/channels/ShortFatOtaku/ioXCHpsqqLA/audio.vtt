WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
This is something I've hinted at here and there, on streams and on other videos I've done,

00:04.640 --> 00:07.440
but I figure it's probably about time I did a full thing on it.

00:07.440 --> 00:13.440
Before I did the political videos, before I made Learn to Code, or MasterCard as the final boss,

00:13.440 --> 00:17.920
or the Sargon Guest Spot, or the Total Biscuit Traps video,

00:17.920 --> 00:22.560
before gamergate, this channel did anime reviews back in 2009,

00:22.560 --> 00:26.480
and we also started doing gaming playthroughs around 2012.

00:26.480 --> 00:30.240
That stuff's still up on my side channels by the way, if you're interested in seeing it.

00:30.240 --> 00:35.200
But my point is, I was largely apolitical, and I travelled in apolitical circles.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.400
Myself, and the two other people who ran this channel at the time,

00:38.400 --> 00:42.640
we had peers and friendships with some of the other small time anime and let's play

00:42.640 --> 00:47.040
youtubers out there. I was just your generic free speech center lefty kinda guy,

00:47.040 --> 00:51.680
which seems to be the default setting for the non-politically inclined in western countries.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.640
Gamergate changed that for me and for a lot of other people.

00:54.640 --> 00:58.720
I really think that was the point in which your average mid-twenty-something person

00:58.720 --> 01:03.280
learned that the establishment they, by default, supported as an apolitical actor,

01:03.280 --> 01:06.320
did not actually have their back the way they thought.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.480
I think that's why the overwhelming opinion on the radical left now is that gamers are

01:10.480 --> 01:14.320
a right-wing group, even though the politics of gamers haven't really changed.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.800
Gamers have just realized that they've largely been abandoned by an enthusiast press that was

01:18.800 --> 01:22.320
supposed to stick up for them when the conservative-leaning Jack Thompson

01:22.320 --> 01:25.280
video games cause school shootings types show up.

01:25.280 --> 01:30.480
In my opinion, this is also why these people think that gamergate caused Trump and Brexit,

01:30.480 --> 01:35.440
because gamergate was the first real pushback against the ideological encroachment of the left,

01:35.440 --> 01:39.040
even if it was only contained within the specific subculture of gaming.

01:39.040 --> 01:42.960
It's probably more accurate to say that the mindset that caused gamergate is the mindset

01:42.960 --> 01:47.680
that caused Trump and Brexit, and that mindset would basically be a willingness to oppose the

01:47.760 --> 01:50.080
tyranny of social justice at every turn.

01:50.080 --> 01:55.440
But since gamergate was the first noteworthy opposition of the hegemon, everything is gamergate.

01:55.440 --> 02:00.640
I titled this video Who I Miss, because in opposing the hegemon, in questioning social

02:00.640 --> 02:06.000
justice rather than simply believing it, in not becoming more radical over time with my peers,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.880
I found that a lot of people turned on me quite quickly.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.960
I haven't even changed that much, not really.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.920
But because the Overton window has shifted so far to the left,

02:13.920 --> 02:16.560
and my colleagues have shifted so far to the left with it,

02:16.560 --> 02:21.680
to them I looked like an alt-right nazi or whatever, because I refuse to move from the

02:21.680 --> 02:26.560
center, and although I have a great online friend group now that I wouldn't trade in for anything,

02:26.560 --> 02:31.200
and I have a great community in my discord who are always amazing pals to hang out with,

02:31.200 --> 02:35.760
I can't help but wonder why everything went so wrong with the people that I used to run with.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.400
It's my guess that if you're even watching this video,

02:38.400 --> 02:42.560
you've probably lost some friends or family members to Trump Derangement Syndrome.

02:42.560 --> 02:47.680
I'm not even a die-hard Trump fan, but because I don't think he's Satan, I guess I'm Satan now.

02:47.680 --> 02:48.880
Here's an example of what I mean.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.240
I made a video about Charlottesville back in 2017,

02:52.240 --> 02:55.520
titled The Moral Equivalence Between the Alt-Right and Antifa.

02:55.520 --> 02:59.200
In it, I spoke about two people that I really looked up to from the Let's Play days,

02:59.200 --> 03:02.400
Casey of Born Losers Gaming and Rick from The D-Pad.

03:02.400 --> 03:06.080
I knew them to be reasonable people, and I figured that I could politely disagree with them.

03:06.080 --> 03:08.800
I devoted part of the video replying to some of their tweets,

03:08.800 --> 03:12.480
and saying what I think they got wrong, and they both blocked me for it.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.680
But it's not just them.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.680
Blacklightattack, who I both looked up to and was once friends with,

03:17.680 --> 03:23.440
created what I think was the first ever Let's Play of a Pokemon Nuzlocke game back in 2011.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.600
Up until him, the Nuzlocke format had been confined to comics and stories,

03:27.600 --> 03:29.840
but he was the first to try to do it in a Let's Play.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.880
And not only did his Nuzlocke of Pokemon Leaf Green

03:32.880 --> 03:36.720
become the number one search result for Pokemon on YouTube at that time,

03:36.720 --> 03:41.440
it also included a lot of edgy jokes that his social justice-aligned current self

03:41.440 --> 03:43.120
would most certainly not approve of.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.600
And of course, there's Spoonie, the guy that inspired the three of us

04:15.600 --> 04:18.800
to even start doing anime reviews a decade ago in the first place.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.000
I told the story of our almost crossover with him in a previous video,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.480
but the short version is, Nicole set it up with him,

04:24.480 --> 04:27.360
we co-wrote a script with him for Tekken The Motion Picture,

04:27.360 --> 04:29.440
we were set to shoot it at Con Bravo,

04:29.440 --> 04:31.600
but Channel Awesome told him at the last minute

04:31.600 --> 04:35.280
that he couldn't crossover with people not on That Guy With The Glasses anymore.

04:35.280 --> 04:39.120
This event was one of the many seeds that caused their split years later.

04:39.120 --> 04:43.360
But Spoonie's videos had no problem embracing the edgy humor of the early 2000s.

05:09.280 --> 05:17.520
Even as he morphed into a complete SJW cuck later on.

05:17.520 --> 05:22.080
In fact, it's telling just how many of the angry reviewers of Internet yesteryear

05:22.080 --> 05:24.240
turned out to be complete losers.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.040
How can you possibly be pro-political correctness,

05:27.040 --> 05:30.720
pro-censorship SJWs when you built your brands on being

05:30.720 --> 05:33.040
irrationally angry at games and movies?

05:33.040 --> 05:37.600
Watching these people rail on about angry gamers or Trump supporters or whatever

05:37.600 --> 05:42.640
just screams to me that they no longer desire or value what little relevance they still have.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.640
And it's not just creators either.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.600
If you are a YouTuber or whatever and you're watching this video,

05:47.600 --> 05:51.760
how many of you have lost a viewer or a fan because of a political stance you took?

05:51.760 --> 05:55.200
Or even worse, because you refuse to take a stance?

05:55.200 --> 05:56.240
I know I have.

05:56.240 --> 05:57.440
Just off the top of my head,

05:57.440 --> 05:59.920
Relan Serrano, one of my oldest viewers,

05:59.920 --> 06:03.440
tried to get my Patreon taken down back when Patreon was relevant.

06:03.440 --> 06:06.160
I can remember many old commenters on the anime reviews

06:06.160 --> 06:08.160
turning around and telling me that I was a bigot

06:08.160 --> 06:12.640
because I reacted to the gaming industry's immense corruption by supporting Gamergate.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.680
Regardless of the facts,

06:13.680 --> 06:16.000
Gamergate was just about misogyny and that was it.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.560
We can also throw Blaster Nation onto this pile,

06:18.560 --> 06:20.880
though this one people might not know quite as well.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.880
Brad Brown writes the social justice-y porn comic Rockcocks,

06:24.880 --> 06:28.960
which he abandoned the vastly superior webcomic Blaster Nation for.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.640
He still kept the Twitter name though.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.640
And speaking of his Twitter, let's check it out.

06:32.640 --> 06:36.000
I loved Catherine and was hoping this remake would fix the one

06:36.000 --> 06:38.880
huge glaring issue with Erika's representation,

06:38.880 --> 06:43.120
but instead they made it far, far worse across two characters now.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.120
Fuck this series and this director.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.840
Throwing my special edition box in the trash.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.720
I refuse to play Persona 5 now out of principle.

06:50.720 --> 06:55.200
I regret the time I spent playing Persona 3 and 4 thinking this shit would get better.

06:55.200 --> 06:59.120
And I regret buying Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's season pass now.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.360
I will not be touching Joker at all.

07:01.360 --> 07:02.880
Fuck Katsura Hashino.

07:02.880 --> 07:07.440
I'm also seeing a lot of UGG Japan posts about this and no, stop.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.800
This is Katsura Hashino.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.880
Yeah, there's a lot of shitheads like him there,

07:10.880 --> 07:14.160
just as there is in every nation, including mine and yours,

07:14.160 --> 07:20.240
but don't negate the great work of Japanese creators pushing positive LGBT plus representation.

07:20.240 --> 07:26.000
So Blaster Nation, Brad Brown, the same man that wrote that three tweet wine?

07:26.000 --> 07:29.200
That's Donkey Kong, 4chan's V. Tripfag.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.080
Yeah, this guy.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.480
His threads still float around 12 years later.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.600
Oh, give me a break.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.040
I have to choose between being a fag or having a tiny dick.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.440
Of course I'm going to fight against both choices.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.280
Really, Brad, I have my pronouns in my Twitter bio, Brown.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.200
Being a fag is bad, eh?

07:45.200 --> 07:46.080
I see.

07:46.080 --> 07:50.720
Donkey Kong, V's very own epic fail guy, etc, etc.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.600
He also made some faggot album that nobody downloaded.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.760
Oh yeah, DK's album.

07:55.760 --> 07:59.840
The V albums are just a series of good video game songs and remixes

07:59.840 --> 08:02.240
slapped together semi-regularly by the community.

08:02.240 --> 08:07.040
But he did the first one and he inspired the later V the musicals and whatever.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.760
Unfortunately, his original album was lost to time,

08:09.760 --> 08:13.440
but I remember it being filled with some pretty problematic stuff.

08:13.440 --> 08:17.680
For example, a stereotypically Asian accented voice that Brad put on

08:17.680 --> 08:21.360
where he played Sakurai, the game dev of Smash Brothers.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.360
Geez, let's hope that never resurfaces

08:23.360 --> 08:26.960
or he'll be seriously dragged on social media by his new friends.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.160
But Brad isn't blind to this change that he's underwent.

08:30.160 --> 08:33.760
Just a few days ago, Hbomberguy put out a video on companies and brands

08:33.760 --> 08:35.760
capitalizing on progressive values

08:35.760 --> 08:39.360
and promoting themselves through manufactured outrage with alt-right types.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.520
And how easily that can swing the other way.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.200
Today, THQ Nordic is hosting an AMA on 8chan.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.880
Didn't you used to answer questions in Blaster Nation threads on 4chan?

08:48.880 --> 08:53.520
I did, sure. Seven years ago, when 4chan was a much different place

08:53.520 --> 08:55.120
and I was a much worse person.

08:55.120 --> 08:57.040
It's not something I would do today.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.960
Or something I would do as the PR person of a major video games publisher

09:00.960 --> 09:04.800
on an infinitely worse website delisted from Google for child pornography.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.400
Hold up, this doesn't feel right.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.960
When you say when 4chan was a different place,

09:08.960 --> 09:12.080
considering the context of how you feel about the chans now,

09:12.080 --> 09:16.080
it seems like you're saying 4chan was better back then than it is now.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.760
And you're also saying that you were a worse person back when you were DK

09:19.760 --> 09:22.480
using this website back when it was better?

09:22.480 --> 09:26.560
So clearly it's not the chans that made you bad, whatever bad is.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.440
I don't know, this message just feels like the panicked deflection

09:29.440 --> 09:33.600
of a guy who understands that his SJW peers will throw him under the bus

09:33.600 --> 09:37.840
at even a hint, a whiff of sin, even if it's 12 years old.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.000
Uh, 4chan wasn't so bad back then.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.400
Also, I've gotten a lot better. I wouldn't do it now.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.720
Also, I wasn't a PR person for a studio.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.400
Please don't excommunicate me.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.360
It seems like this sort of thing has happened to everyone, you know?

09:49.360 --> 09:51.760
People I knew personally, people I looked up to,

09:51.760 --> 09:53.760
people who looked up to me, it doesn't matter.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.560
I can still find examples of all of them being edgy shits

09:56.560 --> 09:59.520
on 4chan or Newgrounds or whatever back in 2009,

09:59.520 --> 10:01.760
but nowadays they're virtue signaling on Twitter,

10:01.760 --> 10:03.840
creating sterile politically correct content

10:03.840 --> 10:06.160
that slowly alienates what's left of their fanbase,

10:06.160 --> 10:09.360
and desperately trying to scrub the collective internet consciousness

10:09.360 --> 10:13.280
whenever their old misdeeds resurface, lest they be dragged on social media.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.560
I'm sure we all remember the early Game Grumps racial epithets,

10:16.560 --> 10:18.000
but just look at Aaron now.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.680
It's almost as if he's been neutered.

10:19.680 --> 10:23.040
Along with this leftward shift, the derangement syndrome,

10:23.040 --> 10:26.400
the abandoning of old contacts refusing to radicalize,

10:26.400 --> 10:29.760
and the disavowal of their less-than-stellar pasts,

10:29.760 --> 10:34.080
these people also seem to embrace a heavily amplified social media presence

10:34.080 --> 10:37.200
in lieu of actually creating the content they were known for.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.720
Everybody at this point knows about Spoonie's legendary downfall

10:40.720 --> 10:43.760
from YouTube titan to 18 hour a day Twitter complainer,

10:43.760 --> 10:44.960
but it's not just him.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.920
Black Light Attack moved out to San Francisco to work for Twitch,

10:47.920 --> 10:51.040
but he couldn't hold the job down because he couldn't wake up on time.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.720
He then tried to make it as a streamer,

10:52.720 --> 10:55.440
but eventually gave that up because he couldn't keep a schedule,

10:55.440 --> 10:58.000
and last I heard, he's moved back to his hometown.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.360
The people who ran Born Losers Gaming were probably the most talented,

11:01.360 --> 11:04.080
small let's players I've ever seen anywhere.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.960
One of them simply moved on and started his adult life.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.760
The other one occasionally makes promises of returning,

11:09.760 --> 11:13.920
but seems to be spending most of his time hosting local Smash Bros tournaments,

11:13.920 --> 11:16.560
and slowly becoming more radicalized over time

11:16.560 --> 11:19.040
as he progresses through his English literature degree.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.800
And I'm not happy to say this, man.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.080
These people were my friends.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.560
These people showed genuine promise and talent,

11:24.560 --> 11:27.440
but they got sucked into their politics to the point that they now think

11:27.440 --> 11:30.800
it's a moral good to shun people who don't think like they do.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.000
And you know what?

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
On the off chance this video gets popular and hits the SJW crowd,

11:36.000 --> 11:39.680
and the moral outrage mob comes for any of the individuals I've talked about,

11:39.680 --> 11:40.960
you want to know what they'll do?

11:40.960 --> 11:44.400
Make excuses about their past, talk about how terrible I am,

11:44.400 --> 11:46.800
and declare that they never really liked me to begin with.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.680
It's what Rick from The D-Pad did when they came for him.

11:49.680 --> 11:54.160
I've always been under the impression that the average person turns more conservative over time,

11:54.160 --> 11:58.160
not more radically left to the point that they self-censor and censor others

11:58.160 --> 12:03.040
and stop associating with those that social justice has deemed undesirable.

12:03.040 --> 12:07.680
I don't know, maybe people just turn more authoritarian as they age rather than conservative.

12:07.680 --> 12:10.800
And because leftist authoritarianism is all the rage right now,

12:10.800 --> 12:12.320
that's where all these people are going.

12:12.320 --> 12:15.120
You might say, hey, maybe it's you, Dev.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.160
And maybe it is.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.720
Maybe I'm the delusional one.

12:18.720 --> 12:22.880
Maybe everyone else is the same as they were and I've radicalized into the alt-right.

12:22.880 --> 12:23.840
It's possible.

12:23.840 --> 12:27.600
I mean, my considering the possibility that I've radicalized rightward,

12:27.600 --> 12:31.840
when they would never consider the possibility that they've radicalized leftward,

12:31.840 --> 12:34.320
might tip you off that it's not me, but whatever.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.280
How about this though?

12:35.280 --> 12:39.920
When I stream on Twitch, one of the guys I sometimes do it with is named Jordan.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.280
Jordan's a good guy, friend of mine.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.160
I appreciate his company, but we are very politically different.

12:44.160 --> 12:48.800
The people on Twitch chat and Discord have jokingly given him the name of The Commie,

12:48.800 --> 12:52.160
because he's about as close to an actual communist as I've ever met IRL.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.120
And you know what?

12:53.120 --> 12:54.240
We're still friends.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.280
We co-exist.

12:55.280 --> 12:59.760
I'm completely fine with being pals with people who have radically different worldviews than I do.

12:59.760 --> 13:03.200
As long as they're not violent, fine, it makes conversations interesting.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.400
And Jordan's a good guy.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.480
If I actually were the radical ideologue,

13:06.480 --> 13:09.680
would I really be chillin' with somebody I directly oppose politically?

13:09.680 --> 13:13.280
And Jordan's moving to Venezuela to experience the true communism.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.360
What if Swalin isn't true communism?

13:15.360 --> 13:17.280
Is this a bunch of Cuck communism coming from Cuba?

13:17.280 --> 13:18.560
It's true socialism.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.720
Yeah, it's bad socialism too.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.720
The only kind.

13:25.440 --> 13:28.800
Hey Jordan, I'm gonna start calling you Jordan B. Peterborough.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.080
Jordan B. Peterborough?

13:30.080 --> 13:32.400
Great, now I have to like end my life off your roof.

13:33.840 --> 13:37.280
This has been a pretty self-indulgent video so far, huh?

13:37.280 --> 13:39.120
Well, if it's bored you, I'm sorry.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.080
I think the pattern I've fallen into with my uploads recently

13:42.080 --> 13:44.480
is that when I talk about a specific situation,

13:44.480 --> 13:48.000
I end with a generalized rule we can extract from the situation.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.840
A bit of wisdom about what's going on.

13:49.840 --> 13:52.240
And if you're looking for that, then here it is.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.320
In one of the weekly sips a little while ago,

13:54.320 --> 13:58.560
I described a kid who was being punished by his university for his political beliefs.

13:58.560 --> 14:02.720
My advice to him in that video was to suck it up, hide his beliefs,

14:02.720 --> 14:05.280
get through school, get a job, get out of there.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.440
I now disagree with that advice.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.200
Firstly, if it's bad in the school system,

14:09.200 --> 14:10.880
it's gonna be worse when you get a real job

14:10.880 --> 14:14.240
with stuff like nannying HR departments and diversity training.

14:14.240 --> 14:18.000
Wherever you are, if you truly believe you're right, make your stand there.

14:18.560 --> 14:22.480
It might be costly, but that cost doesn't decrease from waiting.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.080
So you might as well do it now.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.600
But more importantly than that,

14:25.600 --> 14:27.760
when you run from what you're supposed to confront,

14:27.760 --> 14:31.360
you diminish yourself a little bit and the challenge grows a little bit.

14:31.360 --> 14:33.440
I think we all know this intrinsically.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.320
For example, when you get a bill in the mail, it might be annoying.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.240
But the best thing to do is pay it off.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.280
That bill isn't just a piece of paper sitting in your mailbox.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.120
It's attached to social mechanisms meant to compel you to pay your bills.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.440
So if you let it sit behind your computer monitor

14:47.440 --> 14:49.760
on the bottom of a stack of papers for three years,

14:49.760 --> 14:52.240
not only is the amount you owe going to triple,

14:52.240 --> 14:55.360
but you're going to have other people appearing at your place physically

14:55.360 --> 14:58.240
to get you to pay it or take you away for not paying it,

14:58.240 --> 14:59.520
depending on the circumstance.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.480
But this process happens internally, not just externally.

15:02.480 --> 15:06.400
We know that fears grow stronger and you grow weaker when you run from them.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.480
We also know that when you face your fears,

15:08.480 --> 15:11.760
you might not become less afraid, but you do become more resilient.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.560
This is the fundamental problem with safe space culture, by the way.

15:14.560 --> 15:17.280
People who continually retreat into a safe space

15:17.280 --> 15:20.560
never truly learn that they can withstand the threat their fears represent.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.680
And they end up spending their adult lives simpering away,

15:23.680 --> 15:26.480
waiting for an ever greater authority figure to protect them,

15:26.480 --> 15:29.120
whether that's the school, the corporate structure or the state.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.400
What's important about this is that when you shirk away from the challenge,

15:32.400 --> 15:36.480
you gradually become a part of the problem that you were originally tasked to face.

15:36.480 --> 15:39.920
In other words, when you force yourself to say things you don't believe,

15:39.920 --> 15:41.840
you come to believe the things you say.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.840
This is where I fundamentally disagree with Sargon.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.920
He thinks you can't change what a person believes.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.120
I think you can, but I think it's a very unpleasant business to do so.

15:49.120 --> 15:52.000
We all know that asshole kid in class who started off saying,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.840
well, I'll just write that paper to appeal to my SJW professor and pass the class.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.280
And he ended up becoming the most diehard SJW in the school,

15:59.280 --> 16:01.680
attending rallies, maybe even joining Antifa.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.920
And maybe some of us were that asshole once.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.520
You know what it's like.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.600
You can remember writing the paper.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.800
Your heart's not in it.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.480
You're just regurgitating words.

16:10.480 --> 16:11.680
You're easily distracted.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.440
You feel diminished while you do it.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.080
But when you're done, you haven't only written the paper.

16:16.080 --> 16:20.160
You've constructed an articulated argument that runs counter to what you actually believe.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.800
And your original convictions remain unarticulated.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.840
In essence, you've constructed your own political opponent inside of you.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.080
And the real you has no chance against it,

16:28.080 --> 16:30.960
because the ideas of the real you remain underdeveloped.

16:30.960 --> 16:34.400
And over time, people begin to believe what they've surrounded themselves with,

16:34.400 --> 16:38.400
because it's a whole lot less painful than admitting to yourself that you're a lying coward.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.640
Maybe this is because of school, like BLG.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.600
Maybe it's because of work, like Black Light Attack.

16:43.600 --> 16:47.760
Maybe it's because of social media echo chambers, like Spoonie or Brad Brown.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.600
But all the people that I've talked about today,

16:49.600 --> 16:53.760
and I think really everyone that's been lost to Trump Derangement Syndrome over time,

16:53.760 --> 16:56.080
the real them, the person they used to be,

16:56.080 --> 17:00.080
back when they were apolitical, productive, and most importantly, happy,

17:00.080 --> 17:02.000
that real them is still there.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.840
But that version of themselves has become so rejected and abused,

17:05.840 --> 17:07.920
that there's a good chance they're never coming back.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.600
When you compromise on your principles,

17:09.600 --> 17:12.320
and I don't mean in some small way to meet in the middle,

17:12.320 --> 17:16.880
I mean when you compromise your entire character in order to curry favor with an authority,

17:16.880 --> 17:19.680
you do something akin to shredding your soul.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.520
I don't believe in souls, but you know what I mean.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.520
You demolish a vital part of yourself.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.680
You dispose with what keeps you grounded.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.400
But even though it really sounds like it, it's not all doom and gloom.

17:28.400 --> 17:32.800
Whenever you listen to a self-help person, like a Mel Robbins or Les Brown or whatever,

17:32.800 --> 17:35.920
they always talk about the power of faith and self-actualization,

17:35.920 --> 17:38.800
the ability to desire something from the bottom of your soul,

17:38.800 --> 17:40.880
aim at it, and achieve it through hard work.

17:40.880 --> 17:45.920
What any motivational speech describes is the inverse of what I'm talking about here.

17:45.920 --> 17:49.120
When you stand up for your convictions, even in the face of authority,

17:49.120 --> 17:53.760
you may pay a worldly price for it, a hefty price even, but you grow stronger.

17:53.760 --> 17:58.080
The indescribable part of you that's in the core of your being grows rather than dies.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.240
It's a fertilizing of the human spirit.

18:00.240 --> 18:03.200
This is a bit too much hippie bullshit for you, isn't it?

18:03.200 --> 18:05.200
Well, here's something concrete.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.480
At least, concrete in the best layman's terms that I can put.

18:08.480 --> 18:11.440
The neural pathways in our brain that manage imagination,

18:11.440 --> 18:15.600
and the neural pathways in our brain that manage memory, are linked quite strongly.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.680
Meaning when you're forced to say or do or think something you don't believe,

18:19.680 --> 18:21.040
you break yourself down.

18:21.120 --> 18:25.200
But when you visualize something that you truly do believe in, you build yourself up.

18:25.200 --> 18:29.920
If there's ever been a reason that I oppose social justice warriors, then it is this.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.760
They don't just want your compliance.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.600
They don't just want your behaviors.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.600
They want your thoughts, your minds.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.880
I have seen people I consider to be far greater than me

18:38.880 --> 18:41.920
become diminished beyond belief by their compliance.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.520
By their, I'll just do it once and then it'll be okay attitude.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.080
Like an alcoholic or a drug addict or something.

18:48.080 --> 18:51.760
And now their personalities are completely subsumed by their politics.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.360
Just like an addict's personality is completely subsumed by the addiction.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.640
That will never be me.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.680
And I hope it is never you too.
