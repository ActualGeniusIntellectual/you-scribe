Alright guys, this is about 5 or 10 minutes after I finished up the weekly sip for today,

00:05.920 --> 00:11.280
and I had commented on this little thingy here. YouTube automatically deletes the Chinese phrase

00:11.280 --> 00:16.080
communist bandits, which is these symbols, in all comments now. It means communist bandits

00:16.080 --> 00:20.240
in Chinese. Now anyone who writes a comment on YouTube which has this Chinese word will

00:20.240 --> 00:25.200
be automatically deleted. Many people have tried it, even if they just write the symbols

00:25.200 --> 00:29.520
in the comment. That comment will be deleted right away. I want to know why this word is

00:29.600 --> 00:34.320
a forbidden word to use. This is not even a swear word. Are we not allowed to be anti-Chinese

00:34.320 --> 00:39.680
communist party now? Well, turns out this was posted on the official YouTube help forms,

00:39.680 --> 00:45.680
the Google support. There are no replies, and the question is locked and replying has been disabled.

00:45.680 --> 00:53.360
So perhaps we should actually see if this is the case. I'll copy the symbols. I'll go to

00:54.160 --> 00:58.240
the weekly sip. Here it is. No comments, at least right now.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.120
Paste. Comment. There it is. I'll even pin it. Pinned. There it is.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.840
I go to the video comments. Refresh.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.120
And there it is. Eleven seconds ago, I posted that comment.

01:17.120 --> 01:24.560
And Yiz and Schnitzel have also posted some comments as well. Oh, the live chat was disabled

01:24.560 --> 01:29.600
and SFO's comments about redacted are not appearing. YouTube censorship confirmed.

01:30.640 --> 01:36.000
Is the live chat not appearing? I don't see it. Look, it's not there. Let's refresh.

01:38.560 --> 01:44.400
No live chat. And my comment's gone. My pinned comment. I mean, it's still here.

01:44.400 --> 01:55.920
I refresh. It's gone. So it's true. If you comment that stuff, YouTube simply takes it down

01:55.920 --> 02:01.680
and ignores it. If it's in the live chat, they simply delete the chat. YouTube is finally

02:01.680 --> 02:08.480
beginning to buckle under the weight of Communist China's censorship policies. Now, more than ever,

02:09.120 --> 02:13.600
we have to be supporting alt tech. It is entirely unacceptable to me

02:13.600 --> 02:19.680
that a Western company who should be promoting our values abroad, the values of free speech,

02:19.680 --> 02:25.440
free expression, political debate, a company that is one of a small group that hold the

02:25.440 --> 02:30.880
near monopoly on the online public space, it is unacceptable that these people are beginning to

02:30.880 --> 02:38.560
censor in favor of overseas tyrants. So I'm on Bitchute. My SFO content is on Bitchute. My

02:38.560 --> 02:43.920
dev kit content is on Bitchute. I'm going to set up a Game Boomers Bitchute as well. I stream on

02:43.920 --> 02:47.520
Twitch, even though Twitch is also pretty authoritarian. And I'm going to start looking

02:47.520 --> 02:52.800
into other alternatives as well, because this can't go on. I'm not a communist. I don't live

02:52.800 --> 02:58.720
in China and I will not bind my behavior or my speech based on what they want me to say.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.880
Fuck China and fuck YouTube.
