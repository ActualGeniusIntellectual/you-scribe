0	5920	Alright guys, this is about 5 or 10 minutes after I finished up the weekly sip for today,
5920	11280	and I had commented on this little thingy here. YouTube automatically deletes the Chinese phrase
11280	16080	communist bandits, which is these symbols, in all comments now. It means communist bandits
16080	20240	in Chinese. Now anyone who writes a comment on YouTube which has this Chinese word will
20240	25200	be automatically deleted. Many people have tried it, even if they just write the symbols
25200	29520	in the comment. That comment will be deleted right away. I want to know why this word is
29600	34320	a forbidden word to use. This is not even a swear word. Are we not allowed to be anti-Chinese
34320	39680	communist party now? Well, turns out this was posted on the official YouTube help forms,
39680	45680	the Google support. There are no replies, and the question is locked and replying has been disabled.
45680	53360	So perhaps we should actually see if this is the case. I'll copy the symbols. I'll go to
54160	58240	the weekly sip. Here it is. No comments, at least right now.
60000	67120	Paste. Comment. There it is. I'll even pin it. Pinned. There it is.
67680	69840	I go to the video comments. Refresh.
74160	77120	And there it is. Eleven seconds ago, I posted that comment.
77120	84560	And Yiz and Schnitzel have also posted some comments as well. Oh, the live chat was disabled
84560	89600	and SFO's comments about redacted are not appearing. YouTube censorship confirmed.
90640	96000	Is the live chat not appearing? I don't see it. Look, it's not there. Let's refresh.
98560	104400	No live chat. And my comment's gone. My pinned comment. I mean, it's still here.
104400	115920	I refresh. It's gone. So it's true. If you comment that stuff, YouTube simply takes it down
115920	121680	and ignores it. If it's in the live chat, they simply delete the chat. YouTube is finally
121680	128480	beginning to buckle under the weight of Communist China's censorship policies. Now, more than ever,
129120	133600	we have to be supporting alt tech. It is entirely unacceptable to me
133600	139680	that a Western company who should be promoting our values abroad, the values of free speech,
139680	145440	free expression, political debate, a company that is one of a small group that hold the
145440	150880	near monopoly on the online public space, it is unacceptable that these people are beginning to
150880	158560	censor in favor of overseas tyrants. So I'm on Bitchute. My SFO content is on Bitchute. My
158560	163920	dev kit content is on Bitchute. I'm going to set up a Game Boomers Bitchute as well. I stream on
163920	167520	Twitch, even though Twitch is also pretty authoritarian. And I'm going to start looking
167520	172800	into other alternatives as well, because this can't go on. I'm not a communist. I don't live
172800	178720	in China and I will not bind my behavior or my speech based on what they want me to say.
178720	180880	Fuck China and fuck YouTube.
