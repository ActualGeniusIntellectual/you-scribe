00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Alright guys, this is about 5 or 10 minutes after I finished up the weekly sip for today,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,280
and I had commented on this little thingy here. YouTube automatically deletes the Chinese phrase

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,080
communist bandits, which is these symbols, in all comments now. It means communist bandits

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,240
in Chinese. Now anyone who writes a comment on YouTube which has this Chinese word will

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,200
be automatically deleted. Many people have tried it, even if they just write the symbols

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,520
in the comment. That comment will be deleted right away. I want to know why this word is

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,320
a forbidden word to use. This is not even a swear word. Are we not allowed to be anti-Chinese

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,680
communist party now? Well, turns out this was posted on the official YouTube help forms,

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,680
the Google support. There are no replies, and the question is locked and replying has been disabled.

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,360
So perhaps we should actually see if this is the case. I'll copy the symbols. I'll go to

11
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,240
the weekly sip. Here it is. No comments, at least right now.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,120
Paste. Comment. There it is. I'll even pin it. Pinned. There it is.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
I go to the video comments. Refresh.

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,120
And there it is. Eleven seconds ago, I posted that comment.

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,560
And Yiz and Schnitzel have also posted some comments as well. Oh, the live chat was disabled

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,600
and SFO's comments about redacted are not appearing. YouTube censorship confirmed.

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,000
Is the live chat not appearing? I don't see it. Look, it's not there. Let's refresh.

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,400
No live chat. And my comment's gone. My pinned comment. I mean, it's still here.

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:55,920
I refresh. It's gone. So it's true. If you comment that stuff, YouTube simply takes it down

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,680
and ignores it. If it's in the live chat, they simply delete the chat. YouTube is finally

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,480
beginning to buckle under the weight of Communist China's censorship policies. Now, more than ever,

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,600
we have to be supporting alt tech. It is entirely unacceptable to me

23
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,680
that a Western company who should be promoting our values abroad, the values of free speech,

24
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,440
free expression, political debate, a company that is one of a small group that hold the

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,880
near monopoly on the online public space, it is unacceptable that these people are beginning to

26
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:38,560
censor in favor of overseas tyrants. So I'm on Bitchute. My SFO content is on Bitchute. My

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,920
dev kit content is on Bitchute. I'm going to set up a Game Boomers Bitchute as well. I stream on

28
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,520
Twitch, even though Twitch is also pretty authoritarian. And I'm going to start looking

29
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,800
into other alternatives as well, because this can't go on. I'm not a communist. I don't live

30
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,720
in China and I will not bind my behavior or my speech based on what they want me to say.

31
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,880
Fuck China and fuck YouTube.
