0	4680	As of recording this video, one week ago, Google employee James Damore released a document
4680	6900	that went internally viral within the company.
6900	10400	This document was titled Google's Ideological Echo Chamber, but has become colloquially
10400	11880	known as the Google Manifesto.
11880	15320	I'm going to be referring to the manifesto throughout this video, but it's a bit too
15320	16760	long to simply read the whole thing.
16760	20480	I highly recommend you go read it yourselves at the website googlemanifesto.com.
20480	25000	I will, however, read the TLDR of it, just so you can get an idea of its content.
25000	28420	Google's political bias has equated the freedom from offense with psychological safety,
28420	31780	but shaming into silence is the antithesis of psychological safety.
31780	35540	This silencing has created an ideological echo chamber where some ideas are too sacred
35540	36540	to be honestly discussed.
36540	41100	The lack of discussion fosters the most extreme and authoritarian elements of this ideology.
41100	44540	Extreme meaning, all disparities in representation are due to oppression.
44540	47100	Authoritarian meaning, we should discriminate to correct this oppression.
47100	51540	Differences in distributions of traits between men and women may in part explain why we don't
51540	54540	have 50% representation of women in tech and leadership.
54620	58820	The question to reach equal representation is unfair, divisive, and bad for business.
58820	62620	I'm guessing you probably had the same reaction that I had when I first read it.
62620	65820	Sounds reasonable, but oh boy is this guy in for a world of hurt.
65820	66820	And that's exactly what happened.
66820	71500	The Google employee who wrote the controversial Google Manifesto was fired after CEO Sundar
71500	73580	Pichai called it not okay.
73580	77820	And of course, because this guy just has to sound like a Twitter SJW, he would use the
77820	81340	phrase not okay to describe something that he's ideologically opposed to.
81340	86060	A Google engineer has been fired following the release of a now infamous diversity manifesto.
86060	88620	The engineer confirmed to Bloomberg that he was fired on Monday.
88620	91700	His writing has caused shockwaves across Google and the larger tech industry.
91700	95620	A source confirmed the firing, but a Google representative declined to comment on personal
95620	96620	matters.
96620	100660	CEO Sundar Pichai objects to the author's claims that biological differences make women
100660	102260	less suited for careers in tech.
102260	106700	Pichai suggests that this portion of the manifesto was not okay, and he said it went too far
106700	109580	by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.
109580	113020	To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited
113020	115340	to that work is offensive and not okay.
115340	118900	Now that's quite the claim for Demore to apparently make, that women are less suited
118900	119900	for careers in tech.
119900	122980	Let's look at the actual manifesto and see if it's true.
122980	125380	Possible non-biased causes of the gender gap in tech.
125380	129220	At Google, we're regularly told that implicit and explicit biases are holding women back
129220	130400	in tech and leadership.
130400	134780	Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the workplace differently, and we
134780	136060	should be cognizant of this.
136060	137420	But it's far from the whole story.
137420	140860	On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways.
140860	144360	These differences aren't just socially constructed because they're universal across
144360	149100	human cultures, they often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone,
149100	153360	biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify
153360	154660	and act like males.
154660	158100	The underlying traits are highly heritable, they're exactly what we would predict from
158100	159820	an evolutionary psychology perspective.
159820	163280	I'm not saying that all men differ from women in the following ways, or that these
163280	164460	differences are just.
164620	168140	I'm simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women
168140	172140	differ, in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we
172140	175140	don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.
175140	177100	And in my opinion, here's the important bit.
177100	181700	Many of these differences are small, and there's significant overlap between men and women,
181700	185780	so you can't say anything about an individual given the population level distributions.
185780	189580	Here's a graph that seems to illustrate DeMoor's point a little bit later in the
189580	194180	manifesto, regarding how men as a whole seem to be predisposed to value higher status over
194180	195460	personal comfort.
195460	199580	The green looks like it represents men, and the purple women, and as an aside, nice callback
199580	200940	to gamergate buddy.
200940	205820	As you can see, the absolute upper echelons of men, the top tier, seem to be the pinnacle
205820	209140	of human potential in this regard, and they are there alone.
209140	211080	But the vast majority of men?
211080	213060	They're equal to the vast majority of women.
213060	217060	There is significantly more overlap of genders than anything else, and his second graph goes
217060	221820	on to show how only taking the raw mathematical averages of these cases misrepresents his
221820	222820	argument.
222860	227020	Do you think that Pachai's claim of advancing harmful gender stereotypes, and suggesting
227020	230180	that a group of colleagues have traits to make them less biologically suited for work
230180	232620	at Google is accurate to DeMoor's position?
232620	233820	Because I don't think it is.
233820	237420	In fact, if you look on DeMoor's graph, you can see a giant swath of people where
237420	238820	this is not the case.
238820	242620	But of course, DeMoor was fired from Google for authoring the manifesto, presumably for
242620	243620	wrong think.
243620	247620	Pachai stated that the memo violated Google's code of conduct, and Danielle Brown, Google's
247620	251640	new vice president of diversity, integrity, and governance, sent a statement to staff
251640	254980	condemning DeMoor's views and reaffirmed the company's stance on diversity.
254980	256780	So yeah, wrong think.
256780	260680	The memo and surrounding debate comes as Google fends off a lawsuit from the US Department
260680	263960	of Labor alleging the company systematically discriminates against women.
263960	267760	Google has denied the charges, arguing that it doesn't have a gender pay gap, but has
267760	270840	declined to share full salary information with the government.
270840	275480	According to the company's most recent demographic report, 69% of its workforce and 80% of its
275480	276920	technical staff are male.
276920	280720	Oh, oh, so there's really only two possible ways to interpret this.
280880	285360	DeMoor's assertions were in fact correct, despite Google's attempts to promote diversity,
285360	288400	or Google's actually run by a bunch of fucking bigots.
288400	293120	Well, it may very well be that the second answer, that Google is run by bigots, is actually
293120	294120	the right one.
294120	296000	But not in the way that you might be thinking.
296000	300200	James DeMoor gave an interview to Jordan Peterson on August 8th, and what he has to say on the
300200	301600	subject is really striking.
301600	302600	Let's listen in.
310720	317920	I went to one of our diversity summits, all of it unrecorded and super secret, and they
317920	322160	told me a lot of things that I thought just were not right.
322160	325480	Okay, what do you mean unrecorded and super secret?
325480	332400	Well, I mean, they were telling us about a lot of these potentially illegal practices
332400	337360	that they've been doing to try to increase diversity.
337360	339160	What kind of practices?
340160	345120	Well, basically treating people differently based on what their race or gender are.
345120	347120	Oh, you mean racism?
347120	349120	Yeah, basically.
349120	350120	I see.
350120	354120	And it was ultra secret and unrecorded in what manner?
354120	358600	Yeah, so most meetings at Google are recorded.
358600	360520	Anyone at Google can watch it.
360520	364840	We're trying to be really open about everything, except for this.
364840	368240	They don't want any paper trail for any of these things.
368320	369320	Okay, why?
371320	377320	Because I think it's illegal, and I mean, as some of the internal polls showed, there
377320	382880	were a large percent of people that agreed with me on the document, and so if everyone
382880	389640	got to see this stuff, then they would really bring up some criticism.
389640	394640	Yeah, well, a large number of people in Google and a very large number of well-informed biological
394640	397240	scientists we might also add.
397240	404760	So I mean, I was quite struck by your document, given that it would have been a decent document
404760	408960	for a well-informed psychologist, research psychologist to write, but you're somewhat
408960	414240	of an outsider, but you've got the highlights accurate as far as I'm concerned.
414240	420040	So okay, so you went to this diversity meeting, and you weren't happy with the sorts of things
420040	424000	that you were being told and with the practices, is that both correct?
424000	425000	Yeah.
425000	427760	What were you being told?
430760	436640	I mean, there's a lot of ways in which they pressure people to increase the diversity
436640	442960	of their team, and there's no way to do that besides actually choosing someone based on
442960	444680	their race or gender, right?
444680	450840	It's certainly also distressing to hear that there is acceptance of the idea that diversity
450840	455280	can be mapped onto race and gender, especially with regards to performance, because there's
455280	457480	no evidence for that whatsoever.
457480	463200	So okay, so you went to this meeting, and then you decided to write this document, and
463200	466600	how long had you been working on it before you released it?
466600	474920	Yeah, so I was doing it throughout my free time, and I just wanted to clarify my thoughts
474920	479800	on this, and I really just wanted to be proven wrong, because if what I was saying was right,
479800	482040	then something bad is happening.
482040	489080	And so about a month ago, I submitted it to feedback to that program, and I saw that people
489080	492640	looked at it, but no one actually said anything.
492640	496040	What sort of feedback did you submit?
496040	502680	I basically said what I said in the document, and then I linked to the document itself.
502680	509920	And so I actually published this about a month ago, and it was only after it got viral and
509920	513800	then leaked to the news that Google started caring.
513800	519360	Okay, so how did it go viral, and do you know, and how was it leaked?
519360	526680	Yeah, so there was a group at Google called Skeptics, and so I was like, okay, maybe they'll
526680	528920	be able to prove me wrong in some way.
528920	531960	Like they're skeptical about things, right?
531960	534080	I was naive, I guess.
534080	538200	And so I sent them a message like, okay, what do you think about this?
538200	543600	Is Google in some sort of echo chamber, or am I in an echo chamber?
543600	553720	And then it just exploded after that, and our internal, yeah, it was just spread throughout
553720	554720	all of Google.
554720	560960	And do you know, was it the Skeptics group that started to spread it around?
560960	568200	Yeah, and then there were a lot of upper management that, you know, specifically called
568200	573320	it out and started saying how harmful it is and how it's unacceptable.
573320	576560	This sort of viewpoint is not allowed at Google.
576560	579200	Yeah, what sort of viewpoint exactly?
579200	582800	The idea that there are differences between men and women that actually might play a role
582800	587480	in the corporate world?
587480	589440	That's an opinion that's not acceptable?
589960	592000	Yeah, it seems so.
592000	598240	Oh, so Google is racist and sexist, but apparently in the name of diversity, as in discriminating
598240	599320	against white men.
599320	604160	I know that the bullshit SJW definition of racism and sexism is prejudice plus power,
604160	606200	but legally that's not the case.
606200	610160	This is illegal, which is presumably why these meetings are unrecorded and not released to
610160	611160	the public.
611160	615200	It's no surprise to me that Sundar Pichai, Danielle Brown, and a couple of other Google
615200	617720	execs are regressive left ideologues.
617760	621120	This does seem to be the case at a lot of the big tech giants right now.
621120	624720	It's also no surprise to me that a lot of the underlings actually end up agreeing, at
624720	628920	least in part, with Demore's less ideological and more reasonable point of view.
628920	633920	An examination of the internal memos at Google while the manifesto was going viral, but before
633920	638400	it became public knowledge, shows that a number of employees do, in fact, question Google's
638400	640480	diversity at all costs stance.
640480	644320	But does anybody want to take a guess at how the news media decided to spin this story?
644320	648840	James Demore, the Google employee fired for his controversial manifesto, is almost certainly
648840	651120	not a victim of a free speech violation.
651120	653960	Why free speech couldn't save that Google engineer's job.
653960	657820	I'm a woman in computer science, let me lady-slain the Google memo to you.
657820	661600	How you can use the Google manifesto to advance women, not gender stereotypes.
661600	666320	Google firing its manifesto engineer is a powerful lesson in emotional intelligence.
666320	667640	And many, many more.
667640	670480	I don't need to go through them all with you, links are in the description if you want
670480	671480	to check them out yourself.
671480	674240	But all these articles revolve around three arguments.
674240	675240	1.
675240	679020	That the hurt feelings of the employees that found themselves feeling judged or ashamed
679020	683560	or misrepresented or whatever is more important than the factual accuracy of the manifesto.
683560	684560	2.
684560	688240	Keeping the ideology intact is more important than considering alternative points of view.
688240	689240	3.
689240	692520	That the first amendment protects us against government infringing on free speech, not private
692520	694400	organizations like Google.
694400	695920	Let's go over all three of these points.
695920	696920	1.
696920	700120	The reactions of many journalists, as well as the official reaction by Google's staff,
700120	702300	seems to consist of feelings over facts.
702300	706560	In doing so, these people obfuscate the facts presented within the manifesto.
706560	710880	General trends of large groups of people become specific statements about coworkers.
710880	714320	Talking about ways in which current diversity projects are failing becomes an opinion that
714320	716220	wants no diversity at all.
716220	720320	For an emotional reaction to be sufficient, things had to be blown out of proportion.
720320	723780	Fringe interpretations become the narrative that the media coalesces around, solely to
723780	724780	stamp out dissent.
724780	730080	But in reality, not only are the hurt feelings of employees not more important than the facts,
730080	734080	but these facts are distorted in order to generate the maximum amount of hurt feelings
734080	735080	possible.
735080	736080	2.
736080	739040	The Google Manifesto specifically states that the author, Demore, is not interested in being
739040	740180	anti-diverse.
740180	743720	It states that many women at Google are deserving of their positions due to their hard work
743720	744720	and dedication.
744720	747920	The manifesto advocates for a let-things-fall-where-they-may approach.
747920	752080	Rather than courting specific demographics in an effort for 50-50 parody, allow talent
752080	755840	to rise to the top solely on merit, and the women who have the merit will rise just as
755840	756840	well as the men.
756840	760800	Demore said specifically in the manifesto that he believes sexism exists, and that he
760800	764120	values diversity, but that Google's approach to the problem was wrong.
764120	768400	He advocated for treating people as individuals, not as just another member of their group.
768400	772080	The problem with this point of view wasn't that it was flawed, or that it was sexist.
772080	775160	It was that it went against the ideology of Google's top brass.
775160	779100	When everything is seen through the lens of victimhood, alternative opinions and solutions
779100	782160	to the problems of bigotry are also considered to be bigotry.
782160	783160	3.
783160	787000	The government does, indeed, protect against the government infringing on free speech.
787000	788000	Not Google.
788000	790880	And unless you're part of a union, or you have specific stipulations in your hiring
790880	794380	contract that say otherwise, or it can be proven that your employer broke the law on
794380	797480	firing you, you can be fired for any reason.
797480	798640	Or even no reason.
798640	800960	Just like you can quit your job for any or no reason.
800960	802200	It works both ways.
802200	805700	It seems to be well within Google's legal rights to fire Demore for publishing his manifesto
805700	807160	on their internal servers.
807160	809000	That is a consequence of his free speech.
809000	811400	However, is it unethical of Google to fire him?
811400	814820	Considering that the manifesto is not inflammatory, it's not discriminatory, and it's backed
814820	816160	up by scientific fact?
816160	817160	I think it is.
817160	819700	It's legal, but also unethical.
819700	823520	And now that the public knows that Google, though entirely within their legal rights,
823520	827880	has acted unethically, should we use our own free speech rights to push back against Google?
827880	829120	Yes, we should.
829120	832360	But I don't think Google's going to allow us to do so, at least not on YouTube or other
832360	833680	Google owned platforms.
833680	835880	Remember the adpocalypse of a few months back?
835880	839560	Where ad rates plummeted and despite YouTube's insistence to the contrary, never really recovered?
839720	843280	Well, we've now entered into a second round of YouTube restriction, known as the limited
843280	844280	state.
844280	847920	In a recent YouTube blog post, titled An Update on our Commitment to Fight Terror Content
847920	851720	Online, a number of methods YouTube uses to moderate their platform are described.
851720	855200	I'm going to read a few choice sections for you, and try to give you an honest interpretation
855200	856200	of them.
856200	857200	Tougher standards.
857200	860860	We'll soon be applying tougher treatment to videos that aren't illegal, but have been
860860	865560	flagged by users as potential violations of our policies on hate speech and violent extremism.
865560	869200	If we find that these videos don't violate our policies but contain controversial religious
869200	872340	or supremacist content, they will be placed in a limited state.
872340	875680	The videos will remain on YouTube behind an interstitial, won't be recommended, won't
875680	879640	be monetized, and won't have key features including comments, suggested videos, and
879640	880640	likes.
880640	883640	So basically, the limited state is where YouTube is going to be placing videos that contain
883640	887920	content that they consider to be controversial, even if the video breaks none of YouTube's
887920	888920	rules.
888920	892800	These videos will generate no revenue, and will garner no audience interaction or growth.
892800	896720	YouTube could just boot these videos and their creators offline, but I think the people over
896720	900640	there are smart enough to know that keeping up the pretense of YouTube being a free speech,
900640	904520	free for all platform where people can hear from other people and not just approved sources
904520	906160	is integral to their business.
906160	909840	But it's also clear that YouTube does not want people who create this content around
909840	913200	anymore, and this is them squeezing those content creators hoping they'll up and leave
913200	914200	on their own.
914200	915560	And this is happening right now.
915560	920920	Mundane Matt's channel made $15 and 101,000 views, which is ridiculously low, presumably
920920	928520	because he's a political YouTuber.
928520	932640	The Act Man made a video on how we should all stop making racism and sexism an issue
932640	937680	in video games, titled Feminists and SAWs vs Video Games, and he got a community guidelines
937680	939240	strike for hate speech.
939240	943080	Musical antiheroes been private messaged by another YouTuber who received this lovely
943080	947920	message, limited or no ads due to content identified as not suitable for all advertisers.
947920	951040	Upon requesting a review of this decision, he received this message.
951040	955200	We are only able to review videos with at least 1,000 views in the past 28 days, so
955200	959440	if you're simply not popular enough, you're not even able to have your video reviewed
959440	961480	to see if it was placed in limitation and error.
961480	962680	And it's happened to me too.
962680	966380	I did a video a few months back, titled Is it possible to be a moral pedophile?
966380	970200	In that video I discussed pedophilia from a rational, non-emotional point of view.
970200	974860	I was not apologetic for pedophilia, of course, but I didn't resort to baseless insults
974860	978640	or reactionary comments in my explanation of why I thought pedophilia was an obviously
978640	979640	bad thing.
979640	984620	But because I dared to discuss the topic at all, the video was deemed not advertiser friendly.
984620	988260	It's my opinion that these moves on YouTube's part are directly linked to the Google Manifesto.
988260	991100	It's no secret that YouTube is bleeding money like crazy.
991100	995500	400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube's servers every minute, and the cost to maintain
995500	998140	that amount of data is absolutely colossal.
998140	1001620	Every time somebody clicks a video, that's bandwidth and server strain that comes out
1001620	1002620	of YouTube's pocket.
1002620	1005740	And like Damore said in the Manifesto, Google's finances are not infinite.
1005740	1008140	There's only so much ad revenue to spread around.
1008140	1011540	I think that YouTube needs to start cutting costs in order to stay afloat in the long
1011540	1015460	term, and one way they can do this is by giving creators a smaller cut of that revenue, through
1015460	1017460	actions like the adpocalypse.
1017460	1020780	Another way to do this is to put videos in the limited state described earlier, where
1020780	1024680	no creator revenue will be paid out, and the video won't appear in search results and
1024680	1028820	have no audience interaction, driving the number of views down, which in turn will drive
1028820	1031540	down the strain on YouTube's servers, saving them a little bit of money.
1031580	1035980	I think the limited state, in the coming months and years, will be expanded to large swaths
1035980	1037780	of content as a cost-cutting measure.
1037780	1042080	I think they're starting off with non-left political or anti-social justice content for
1042080	1043120	a number of reasons.
1043120	1046000	This content is relatively easy to identify at a quick glance.
1046000	1049940	The community surrounding this type of channel is somewhat insular, so their loss will create
1049940	1051220	minimal shockwaves.
1051220	1054380	And because they're ideologically opposed to that content, which we already know to
1054380	1057940	be the case with the Google Manifesto, it's like killing two birds with one stone for
1057940	1058940	them.
1059940	1066900	This connects to another point on YouTube's blog post about methods currently being taken
1066900	1068220	to moderate the platform.
1068220	1070980	Early intervention and expanding counter-extremism work.
1082980	1087340	Well okay, when somebody searches, say, how to join ISIS, they're going to get videos
1087340	1090420	related to why ISIS is bad, how to get help, etc etc.
1090420	1092460	That's not necessarily a bad thing.
1092460	1094540	But recall the Google Manifesto again.
1094540	1098620	Recall Sundar Pichai's blog post describing the women at Google as hurting and feeling
1098620	1099620	under threat.
1099620	1102860	I do not trust YouTube's determination on what should be covered by redirection.
1102860	1106540	This honestly sounds to me like in the near future we're going to be seeing a scenario
1106540	1110620	in which somebody searches for anti-SJW on YouTube and the search fetches a bunch of
1110620	1114740	social justice videos telling him that social justice is the superior ideology and that
1114740	1116400	the people who disagree are bigoted.
1116400	1117600	Or experts.
1117600	1120340	Of course, our systems are only as good as the data they're based on.
1120340	1124320	Over the past weeks, we have begun working with more than 15 additional expert NGOs and
1124320	1128040	institutions through our trusted FLAGA program, including the Anti-Defamation League, the
1128040	1131000	No Hate Speech movement, and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.
1131000	1134440	Tell me Google, did you include Crash Override in that list of partners?
1134440	1137680	You know, Zoe Quinn's organization, the one that was all about helping victims of
1137680	1141040	online harassment, but specifically set out to harass people they disagreed with?
1141040	1146080	You know, the harassers you invited to Google to get their opinion on how to stop harassment?
1146080	1149240	Rather detection and faster removal driven by machine learning, we've always used a
1149240	1153080	mix of technology and human review to address the ever-changing challenges around controversial
1153080	1154140	content on YouTube.
1154140	1157800	We recently began developing and implementing cutting-edge machine learning technology designed
1157800	1161800	to help us identify and remove violent extremism and terrorism-related content in a scalable
1161800	1162800	way.
1162800	1166200	Oh yes, yes, we all know that Google's AI technology is cutting edge.
1166200	1170540	Meet Perspective, Google's AI bot that will take comments and speech and tell you how
1170540	1171540	toxic it is.
1171540	1177100	Let's give it a go, shall we?
1177100	1181340	The U.S. Government is Corrupt Oh, 71% toxic, is it?
1181340	1183340	We'd better censor that opinion straight away.
1183340	1189060	The U.S. Government is Wonderful Ah, 5% toxic, that's better.
1189060	1192140	The word Trump all on its own is 42% toxic.
1192140	1195700	If you're going for 100%, that's a gimme right off the bat.
1195700	1201780	Black man dating white woman 86% toxic
1201780	1206700	How many millions did you spend, Google, to develop an AI that disapproves of race mixing?
1206700	1211100	If I hadn't made it clear by now, I don't trust YouTube to be objective in their policing
1211100	1215700	of its platform, because of the extreme ineptitude of its staff and tools, its past behaviors
1215700	1220040	when it comes to the DMCA, and because its parent company, Google, has an ideological
1220040	1222780	stake in YouTube not being objective.
1222780	1224060	But there is a silver lining here.
1224060	1227740	The media has not completely united around Google in the way that it united around developers
1227740	1229180	and press during Gamergate.
1229180	1232620	Even though it's a very similar story of an insider publishing trade secrets that show
1232620	1234620	illegal and unethical practices.
1234620	1238820	Though there was that one idiot over at the Guardian that actually blamed this all on
1238820	1239820	Gamergate.
1239820	1242380	But okay, okay, that's enough stupidity for one video.
1242380	1243660	Silver lining, silver lining.
1243660	1246660	No, the Google manifesto isn't sexist or anti-diversity.
1246660	1247660	It's science.
1247660	1251140	Mr. Demore confirmed last night he was fired for perpetuating gender stereotypes.
1251140	1255340	Despite how it's been portrayed, the memo was fair and factually accurate.
1255340	1258800	Scientific studies have confirmed sex differences in the brain that lead to differences in our
1258800	1260380	interests and behavior.
1260380	1264860	As mentioned in the memo, gendered interests are predicted by exposure to prenatal testosterone.
1264860	1268420	Higher levels are associated with a preference for mechanically interesting things in occupations
1268420	1269420	in adulthood.
1269420	1273420	Lower levels are associated with a preference for people-oriented activities in occupations.
1273420	1276220	This is why STEM fields tend to be dominated by men.
1276220	1279040	And this speaks to the regressive left's extreme problem with science.
1279040	1282640	They only claim it as part of their domain when its outcomes agree with their ideology.
1282640	1286280	But could climate change, you know, that thing that hard-left environmentalists repeatedly
1286280	1288080	say that the science is settled on?
1288080	1291240	Like here, over at Slate, climate science is settled enough.
1291240	1294040	How long do you think it's going to take me to dig up a Slate article talking about how
1294040	1300680	the Google manifesto is wrong and that science isn't representative of the truth?
1300680	1301680	Well I'm back.
1301680	1303440	It took me about three fucking seconds.
1303440	1307280	Science is something that, when it agrees with the regressive left's worldview, is cool
1307280	1309780	and awesome and worthy of upvotes on Reddit.
1309780	1313080	But when it tells them that they're wrong, it's hateful and discriminatory.
1313080	1316180	Remember that bit with the black student who thought a shaman could call down lightning
1316180	1318840	and that the guy who told her she was wrong was racist?
1318840	1326040	There's a place in Kabyalihana, and they believe that through the magic, the black magic, you
1326040	1330560	call it black magic, they call it witchcuff to others, that you are able to send a lightning
1330560	1331560	to strike someone.
1331560	1341520	Yeah, isn't that a special brand of insanity?
1341520	1345520	Well a bit later in the video, she talks about how science must be destroyed and remade from
1345520	1347880	the ground up with her specific style of understanding.
1347880	1353360	Western modernity is the problem that decolonization directly deals with, to say that we are going
1353360	1358920	to decolonize by having knowledge that is produced by us, that speaks to us, and that
1358920	1361760	is able to accommodate knowledge from our perspective.
1361760	1366560	So if you're saying that you disagree with her approach, it means that you are vested
1366560	1370280	in the Western and Eurocentric way of understanding, which means you yourself still need to go
1370280	1376240	back, internally decolonize your mind, come back and say, how can I re-look at what I've
1376240	1380560	been studying all these years, because Western knowledge is very pathetic to say the least.
1380560	1385400	I from a decolonized perspective believe we can do more as knowledge producers, as people
1385400	1390680	who are given the ability to reason or whatever, is that people say we do when we think or
1390680	1391680	rationalize.
1391680	1396760	So decolonizing the science would mean doing away with it entirely and starting all over
1396760	1400440	again to deal with how we respond to the environment and how we understand it.
1400440	1402000	Here's the problem with that.
1402000	1405720	If your African scientists are worth a damn, they're still going to come to the conclusion
1405720	1407320	that shamans can't summon lightning.
1407320	1411160	The scientific process is the scientific process, and it does not change based on your culture
1411160	1412480	or lived experiences.
1412480	1416160	The nerd in me would now like to reference this Star Trek clip, just to show you that
1416160	1444920	despite your ideology, science will always be correct about the nature of the universe.
1444920	1448080	Beyond the science angle, people are also taking other stands.
1448080	1451080	Demors filed suit against Google and I hope it goes well for him.
1451080	1454520	I truly believe that the professional treatment of people who don't share the political views
1454520	1459180	of their CEOs is serious enough to possibly consider it a civil rights issue.
1459180	1463120	Some think that Sundar Pichai was in the wrong, so much so that he should step down.
1463120	1465180	Others are talking about the free speech angle too.
1465180	1469260	The application of hostile work environment law to workplace speech, including basically
1469260	1473360	political or ideological discussions, not just vulgar jokes or unwanted personal talk,
1473360	1474760	goes back decades.
1474760	1480480	Jonathan Rauch, for example, in the New Republic in 1997, wrote that quietly, gradually, the
1480480	1484280	workplace has become an exception to the general rule that in America the law does not seek
1484280	1486320	to restrain wrongful opinion and expression.
1486320	1489680	And Rauch explained the indirect mechanism by which this has come to pass.
1489680	1494440	What the government cannot do directly, it now requires employers to do in its stead.
1494440	1496040	Police discriminatory speech.
1496040	1500000	It seems to me that conservatives aren't really all that welcome within Silicon Valley.
1500000	1504040	I'm not even a conservative, and I can tell that rational conservative arguments are being
1504040	1508520	snuffed out at major tech companies in the USA, in favour of feels-based, regressive
1508520	1512960	left policies, as well as more than a few cry sessions after Donald Trump's election.
1512960	1517480	I think political affiliation and opinion should be protected by law from firing in
1517480	1521240	the same way as race, religion, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on.
1521240	1525200	It's the only way to ensure diversity of opinion at these companies, which by the way,
1525200	1529220	is far more important than surface level diversity like race and sex.
1529220	1532760	And yet the higher ups at these companies just don't see that there's a problem with
1532760	1534200	how they treat conservatives.
1534200	1537680	The subject of Google's ideological bent came up at the most recent shareholder meeting
1537680	1538680	in June.
1538680	1542320	A shareholder asked executives whether conservatives would feel welcome at the company.
1542320	1544320	Executives disagreed with the idea that anyone wouldn't.
1544320	1548760	The company was founded under the principles of freedom of expression, diversity, inclusiveness,
1548760	1550000	and science-based thinking.
1550000	1553200	You'll also find that all of the other companies in our industry agree with us.
1553200	1556680	Either they're entirely unaware of their horrendous and unethical treatment of people
1556680	1559420	that disagree with them, or they just simply do not care.
1559420	1563060	If this doesn't stop, I think we're going to see a balkanization of the tech industry.
1563060	1567340	Talented young minds, not interested in working within the oppressive atmospheres of today's
1567340	1571260	Google, Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook, will flee to alternative services and startups
1571260	1572260	with potential.
1572260	1577300	We're already seeing it, with Vidme, Gab, Vote, and Mines springing up as viable, growing
1577300	1578300	healthy alternatives.
1578300	1582000	I foresee a future in which there's two sets of social media platforms.
1582000	1586360	The left will define the two as reasonable people versus bigots, while the rest of us
1586360	1589940	will simply see them as hard left versus everybody else.
1589940	1594140	The regressive left will continue to reinforce their echo chambers, perform witch hunts,
1594140	1598420	and drive people away to the remaining social media platforms dedicated to free speech.
1598420	1602240	And those platforms that remain out of their ideological grasp will be branded as hate
1602240	1604600	sites with no value whatsoever.
1604600	1607380	Two sets of services, two internets.
1607380	1610360	And this will only be bad for the current social media giants.
1610360	1614740	They have everything to lose in this future, and if it happens, they'll have only themselves
1614740	1644560	to blame for it.
1644560	1649100	Of course, considering the upcoming balkanization of social media, now is probably a good time
1649100	1651560	to start getting on some of those alternative sites.
1651560	1655500	I've already got a Mines account where I post each one of these videos, under the name,
1655500	1659180	you guessed it, Short Fight Otaku, and I'm going to start looking at mirroring my work
1659180	1662700	on Vidme as well, because I hear that's actually a very good YouTube alternative.
1662700	1664620	Alright, that about does it for me.
1664620	1665980	I'll catch you later, guys.
1665980	1666500	I love you.
