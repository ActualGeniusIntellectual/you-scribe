00:00.000 --> 00:04.680
As of recording this video, one week ago, Google employee James Damore released a document

00:04.680 --> 00:06.900
that went internally viral within the company.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.400
This document was titled Google's Ideological Echo Chamber, but has become colloquially

00:10.400 --> 00:11.880
known as the Google Manifesto.

00:11.880 --> 00:15.320
I'm going to be referring to the manifesto throughout this video, but it's a bit too

00:15.320 --> 00:16.760
long to simply read the whole thing.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.480
I highly recommend you go read it yourselves at the website googlemanifesto.com.

00:20.480 --> 00:25.000
I will, however, read the TLDR of it, just so you can get an idea of its content.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.420
Google's political bias has equated the freedom from offense with psychological safety,

00:28.420 --> 00:31.780
but shaming into silence is the antithesis of psychological safety.

00:31.780 --> 00:35.540
This silencing has created an ideological echo chamber where some ideas are too sacred

00:35.540 --> 00:36.540
to be honestly discussed.

00:36.540 --> 00:41.100
The lack of discussion fosters the most extreme and authoritarian elements of this ideology.

00:41.100 --> 00:44.540
Extreme meaning, all disparities in representation are due to oppression.

00:44.540 --> 00:47.100
Authoritarian meaning, we should discriminate to correct this oppression.

00:47.100 --> 00:51.540
Differences in distributions of traits between men and women may in part explain why we don't

00:51.540 --> 00:54.540
have 50% representation of women in tech and leadership.

00:54.620 --> 00:58.820
The question to reach equal representation is unfair, divisive, and bad for business.

00:58.820 --> 01:02.620
I'm guessing you probably had the same reaction that I had when I first read it.

01:02.620 --> 01:05.820
Sounds reasonable, but oh boy is this guy in for a world of hurt.

01:05.820 --> 01:06.820
And that's exactly what happened.

01:06.820 --> 01:11.500
The Google employee who wrote the controversial Google Manifesto was fired after CEO Sundar

01:11.500 --> 01:13.580
Pichai called it not okay.

01:13.580 --> 01:17.820
And of course, because this guy just has to sound like a Twitter SJW, he would use the

01:17.820 --> 01:21.340
phrase not okay to describe something that he's ideologically opposed to.

01:21.340 --> 01:26.060
A Google engineer has been fired following the release of a now infamous diversity manifesto.

01:26.060 --> 01:28.620
The engineer confirmed to Bloomberg that he was fired on Monday.

01:28.620 --> 01:31.700
His writing has caused shockwaves across Google and the larger tech industry.

01:31.700 --> 01:35.620
A source confirmed the firing, but a Google representative declined to comment on personal

01:35.620 --> 01:36.620
matters.

01:36.620 --> 01:40.660
CEO Sundar Pichai objects to the author's claims that biological differences make women

01:40.660 --> 01:42.260
less suited for careers in tech.

01:42.260 --> 01:46.700
Pichai suggests that this portion of the manifesto was not okay, and he said it went too far

01:46.700 --> 01:49.580
by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.

01:49.580 --> 01:53.020
To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited

01:53.020 --> 01:55.340
to that work is offensive and not okay.

01:55.340 --> 01:58.900
Now that's quite the claim for Demore to apparently make, that women are less suited

01:58.900 --> 01:59.900
for careers in tech.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.980
Let's look at the actual manifesto and see if it's true.

02:02.980 --> 02:05.380
Possible non-biased causes of the gender gap in tech.

02:05.380 --> 02:09.220
At Google, we're regularly told that implicit and explicit biases are holding women back

02:09.220 --> 02:10.400
in tech and leadership.

02:10.400 --> 02:14.780
Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the workplace differently, and we

02:14.780 --> 02:16.060
should be cognizant of this.

02:16.060 --> 02:17.420
But it's far from the whole story.

02:17.420 --> 02:20.860
On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways.

02:20.860 --> 02:24.360
These differences aren't just socially constructed because they're universal across

02:24.360 --> 02:29.100
human cultures, they often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone,

02:29.100 --> 02:33.360
biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify

02:33.360 --> 02:34.660
and act like males.

02:34.660 --> 02:38.100
The underlying traits are highly heritable, they're exactly what we would predict from

02:38.100 --> 02:39.820
an evolutionary psychology perspective.

02:39.820 --> 02:43.280
I'm not saying that all men differ from women in the following ways, or that these

02:43.280 --> 02:44.460
differences are just.

02:44.620 --> 02:48.140
I'm simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women

02:48.140 --> 02:52.140
differ, in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we

02:52.140 --> 02:55.140
don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.

02:55.140 --> 02:57.100
And in my opinion, here's the important bit.

02:57.100 --> 03:01.700
Many of these differences are small, and there's significant overlap between men and women,

03:01.700 --> 03:05.780
so you can't say anything about an individual given the population level distributions.

03:05.780 --> 03:09.580
Here's a graph that seems to illustrate DeMoor's point a little bit later in the

03:09.580 --> 03:14.180
manifesto, regarding how men as a whole seem to be predisposed to value higher status over

03:14.180 --> 03:15.460
personal comfort.

03:15.460 --> 03:19.580
The green looks like it represents men, and the purple women, and as an aside, nice callback

03:19.580 --> 03:20.940
to gamergate buddy.

03:20.940 --> 03:25.820
As you can see, the absolute upper echelons of men, the top tier, seem to be the pinnacle

03:25.820 --> 03:29.140
of human potential in this regard, and they are there alone.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.080
But the vast majority of men?

03:31.080 --> 03:33.060
They're equal to the vast majority of women.

03:33.060 --> 03:37.060
There is significantly more overlap of genders than anything else, and his second graph goes

03:37.060 --> 03:41.820
on to show how only taking the raw mathematical averages of these cases misrepresents his

03:41.820 --> 03:42.820
argument.

03:42.860 --> 03:47.020
Do you think that Pachai's claim of advancing harmful gender stereotypes, and suggesting

03:47.020 --> 03:50.180
that a group of colleagues have traits to make them less biologically suited for work

03:50.180 --> 03:52.620
at Google is accurate to DeMoor's position?

03:52.620 --> 03:53.820
Because I don't think it is.

03:53.820 --> 03:57.420
In fact, if you look on DeMoor's graph, you can see a giant swath of people where

03:57.420 --> 03:58.820
this is not the case.

03:58.820 --> 04:02.620
But of course, DeMoor was fired from Google for authoring the manifesto, presumably for

04:02.620 --> 04:03.620
wrong think.

04:03.620 --> 04:07.620
Pachai stated that the memo violated Google's code of conduct, and Danielle Brown, Google's

04:07.620 --> 04:11.640
new vice president of diversity, integrity, and governance, sent a statement to staff

04:11.640 --> 04:14.980
condemning DeMoor's views and reaffirmed the company's stance on diversity.

04:14.980 --> 04:16.780
So yeah, wrong think.

04:16.780 --> 04:20.680
The memo and surrounding debate comes as Google fends off a lawsuit from the US Department

04:20.680 --> 04:23.960
of Labor alleging the company systematically discriminates against women.

04:23.960 --> 04:27.760
Google has denied the charges, arguing that it doesn't have a gender pay gap, but has

04:27.760 --> 04:30.840
declined to share full salary information with the government.

04:30.840 --> 04:35.480
According to the company's most recent demographic report, 69% of its workforce and 80% of its

04:35.480 --> 04:36.920
technical staff are male.

04:36.920 --> 04:40.720
Oh, oh, so there's really only two possible ways to interpret this.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.360
DeMoor's assertions were in fact correct, despite Google's attempts to promote diversity,

04:45.360 --> 04:48.400
or Google's actually run by a bunch of fucking bigots.

04:48.400 --> 04:53.120
Well, it may very well be that the second answer, that Google is run by bigots, is actually

04:53.120 --> 04:54.120
the right one.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.000
But not in the way that you might be thinking.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.200
James DeMoor gave an interview to Jordan Peterson on August 8th, and what he has to say on the

05:00.200 --> 05:01.600
subject is really striking.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.600
Let's listen in.

05:10.720 --> 05:17.920
I went to one of our diversity summits, all of it unrecorded and super secret, and they

05:17.920 --> 05:22.160
told me a lot of things that I thought just were not right.

05:22.160 --> 05:25.480
Okay, what do you mean unrecorded and super secret?

05:25.480 --> 05:32.400
Well, I mean, they were telling us about a lot of these potentially illegal practices

05:32.400 --> 05:37.360
that they've been doing to try to increase diversity.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.160
What kind of practices?

05:40.160 --> 05:45.120
Well, basically treating people differently based on what their race or gender are.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.120
Oh, you mean racism?

05:47.120 --> 05:49.120
Yeah, basically.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.120
I see.

05:50.120 --> 05:54.120
And it was ultra secret and unrecorded in what manner?

05:54.120 --> 05:58.600
Yeah, so most meetings at Google are recorded.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.520
Anyone at Google can watch it.

06:00.520 --> 06:04.840
We're trying to be really open about everything, except for this.

06:04.840 --> 06:08.240
They don't want any paper trail for any of these things.

06:08.320 --> 06:09.320
Okay, why?

06:11.320 --> 06:17.320
Because I think it's illegal, and I mean, as some of the internal polls showed, there

06:17.320 --> 06:22.880
were a large percent of people that agreed with me on the document, and so if everyone

06:22.880 --> 06:29.640
got to see this stuff, then they would really bring up some criticism.

06:29.640 --> 06:34.640
Yeah, well, a large number of people in Google and a very large number of well-informed biological

06:34.640 --> 06:37.240
scientists we might also add.

06:37.240 --> 06:44.760
So I mean, I was quite struck by your document, given that it would have been a decent document

06:44.760 --> 06:48.960
for a well-informed psychologist, research psychologist to write, but you're somewhat

06:48.960 --> 06:54.240
of an outsider, but you've got the highlights accurate as far as I'm concerned.

06:54.240 --> 07:00.040
So okay, so you went to this diversity meeting, and you weren't happy with the sorts of things

07:00.040 --> 07:04.000
that you were being told and with the practices, is that both correct?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Yeah.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.760
What were you being told?

07:10.760 --> 07:16.640
I mean, there's a lot of ways in which they pressure people to increase the diversity

07:16.640 --> 07:22.960
of their team, and there's no way to do that besides actually choosing someone based on

07:22.960 --> 07:24.680
their race or gender, right?

07:24.680 --> 07:30.840
It's certainly also distressing to hear that there is acceptance of the idea that diversity

07:30.840 --> 07:35.280
can be mapped onto race and gender, especially with regards to performance, because there's

07:35.280 --> 07:37.480
no evidence for that whatsoever.

07:37.480 --> 07:43.200
So okay, so you went to this meeting, and then you decided to write this document, and

07:43.200 --> 07:46.600
how long had you been working on it before you released it?

07:46.600 --> 07:54.920
Yeah, so I was doing it throughout my free time, and I just wanted to clarify my thoughts

07:54.920 --> 07:59.800
on this, and I really just wanted to be proven wrong, because if what I was saying was right,

07:59.800 --> 08:02.040
then something bad is happening.

08:02.040 --> 08:09.080
And so about a month ago, I submitted it to feedback to that program, and I saw that people

08:09.080 --> 08:12.640
looked at it, but no one actually said anything.

08:12.640 --> 08:16.040
What sort of feedback did you submit?

08:16.040 --> 08:22.680
I basically said what I said in the document, and then I linked to the document itself.

08:22.680 --> 08:29.920
And so I actually published this about a month ago, and it was only after it got viral and

08:29.920 --> 08:33.800
then leaked to the news that Google started caring.

08:33.800 --> 08:39.360
Okay, so how did it go viral, and do you know, and how was it leaked?

08:39.360 --> 08:46.680
Yeah, so there was a group at Google called Skeptics, and so I was like, okay, maybe they'll

08:46.680 --> 08:48.920
be able to prove me wrong in some way.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.960
Like they're skeptical about things, right?

08:51.960 --> 08:54.080
I was naive, I guess.

08:54.080 --> 08:58.200
And so I sent them a message like, okay, what do you think about this?

08:58.200 --> 09:03.600
Is Google in some sort of echo chamber, or am I in an echo chamber?

09:03.600 --> 09:13.720
And then it just exploded after that, and our internal, yeah, it was just spread throughout

09:13.720 --> 09:14.720
all of Google.

09:14.720 --> 09:20.960
And do you know, was it the Skeptics group that started to spread it around?

09:20.960 --> 09:28.200
Yeah, and then there were a lot of upper management that, you know, specifically called

09:28.200 --> 09:33.320
it out and started saying how harmful it is and how it's unacceptable.

09:33.320 --> 09:36.560
This sort of viewpoint is not allowed at Google.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.200
Yeah, what sort of viewpoint exactly?

09:39.200 --> 09:42.800
The idea that there are differences between men and women that actually might play a role

09:42.800 --> 09:47.480
in the corporate world?

09:47.480 --> 09:49.440
That's an opinion that's not acceptable?

09:49.960 --> 09:52.000
Yeah, it seems so.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.240
Oh, so Google is racist and sexist, but apparently in the name of diversity, as in discriminating

09:58.240 --> 09:59.320
against white men.

09:59.320 --> 10:04.160
I know that the bullshit SJW definition of racism and sexism is prejudice plus power,

10:04.160 --> 10:06.200
but legally that's not the case.

10:06.200 --> 10:10.160
This is illegal, which is presumably why these meetings are unrecorded and not released to

10:10.160 --> 10:11.160
the public.

10:11.160 --> 10:15.200
It's no surprise to me that Sundar Pichai, Danielle Brown, and a couple of other Google

10:15.200 --> 10:17.720
execs are regressive left ideologues.

10:17.760 --> 10:21.120
This does seem to be the case at a lot of the big tech giants right now.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.720
It's also no surprise to me that a lot of the underlings actually end up agreeing, at

10:24.720 --> 10:28.920
least in part, with Demore's less ideological and more reasonable point of view.

10:28.920 --> 10:33.920
An examination of the internal memos at Google while the manifesto was going viral, but before

10:33.920 --> 10:38.400
it became public knowledge, shows that a number of employees do, in fact, question Google's

10:38.400 --> 10:40.480
diversity at all costs stance.

10:40.480 --> 10:44.320
But does anybody want to take a guess at how the news media decided to spin this story?

10:44.320 --> 10:48.840
James Demore, the Google employee fired for his controversial manifesto, is almost certainly

10:48.840 --> 10:51.120
not a victim of a free speech violation.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.960
Why free speech couldn't save that Google engineer's job.

10:53.960 --> 10:57.820
I'm a woman in computer science, let me lady-slain the Google memo to you.

10:57.820 --> 11:01.600
How you can use the Google manifesto to advance women, not gender stereotypes.

11:01.600 --> 11:06.320
Google firing its manifesto engineer is a powerful lesson in emotional intelligence.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.640
And many, many more.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.480
I don't need to go through them all with you, links are in the description if you want

11:10.480 --> 11:11.480
to check them out yourself.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.240
But all these articles revolve around three arguments.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.240
1.

11:15.240 --> 11:19.020
That the hurt feelings of the employees that found themselves feeling judged or ashamed

11:19.020 --> 11:23.560
or misrepresented or whatever is more important than the factual accuracy of the manifesto.

11:23.560 --> 11:24.560
2.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.240
Keeping the ideology intact is more important than considering alternative points of view.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.240
3.

11:29.240 --> 11:32.520
That the first amendment protects us against government infringing on free speech, not private

11:32.520 --> 11:34.400
organizations like Google.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.920
Let's go over all three of these points.

11:35.920 --> 11:36.920
1.

11:36.920 --> 11:40.120
The reactions of many journalists, as well as the official reaction by Google's staff,

11:40.120 --> 11:42.300
seems to consist of feelings over facts.

11:42.300 --> 11:46.560
In doing so, these people obfuscate the facts presented within the manifesto.

11:46.560 --> 11:50.880
General trends of large groups of people become specific statements about coworkers.

11:50.880 --> 11:54.320
Talking about ways in which current diversity projects are failing becomes an opinion that

11:54.320 --> 11:56.220
wants no diversity at all.

11:56.220 --> 12:00.320
For an emotional reaction to be sufficient, things had to be blown out of proportion.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.780
Fringe interpretations become the narrative that the media coalesces around, solely to

12:03.780 --> 12:04.780
stamp out dissent.

12:04.780 --> 12:10.080
But in reality, not only are the hurt feelings of employees not more important than the facts,

12:10.080 --> 12:14.080
but these facts are distorted in order to generate the maximum amount of hurt feelings

12:14.080 --> 12:15.080
possible.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.080
2.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.040
The Google Manifesto specifically states that the author, Demore, is not interested in being

12:19.040 --> 12:20.180
anti-diverse.

12:20.180 --> 12:23.720
It states that many women at Google are deserving of their positions due to their hard work

12:23.720 --> 12:24.720
and dedication.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.920
The manifesto advocates for a let-things-fall-where-they-may approach.

12:27.920 --> 12:32.080
Rather than courting specific demographics in an effort for 50-50 parody, allow talent

12:32.080 --> 12:35.840
to rise to the top solely on merit, and the women who have the merit will rise just as

12:35.840 --> 12:36.840
well as the men.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.800
Demore said specifically in the manifesto that he believes sexism exists, and that he

12:40.800 --> 12:44.120
values diversity, but that Google's approach to the problem was wrong.

12:44.120 --> 12:48.400
He advocated for treating people as individuals, not as just another member of their group.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.080
The problem with this point of view wasn't that it was flawed, or that it was sexist.

12:52.080 --> 12:55.160
It was that it went against the ideology of Google's top brass.

12:55.160 --> 12:59.100
When everything is seen through the lens of victimhood, alternative opinions and solutions

12:59.100 --> 13:02.160
to the problems of bigotry are also considered to be bigotry.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.160
3.

13:03.160 --> 13:07.000
The government does, indeed, protect against the government infringing on free speech.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Not Google.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.880
And unless you're part of a union, or you have specific stipulations in your hiring

13:10.880 --> 13:14.380
contract that say otherwise, or it can be proven that your employer broke the law on

13:14.380 --> 13:17.480
firing you, you can be fired for any reason.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.640
Or even no reason.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.960
Just like you can quit your job for any or no reason.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.200
It works both ways.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.700
It seems to be well within Google's legal rights to fire Demore for publishing his manifesto

13:25.700 --> 13:27.160
on their internal servers.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.000
That is a consequence of his free speech.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.400
However, is it unethical of Google to fire him?

13:31.400 --> 13:34.820
Considering that the manifesto is not inflammatory, it's not discriminatory, and it's backed

13:34.820 --> 13:36.160
up by scientific fact?

13:36.160 --> 13:37.160
I think it is.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.700
It's legal, but also unethical.

13:39.700 --> 13:43.520
And now that the public knows that Google, though entirely within their legal rights,

13:43.520 --> 13:47.880
has acted unethically, should we use our own free speech rights to push back against Google?

13:47.880 --> 13:49.120
Yes, we should.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.360
But I don't think Google's going to allow us to do so, at least not on YouTube or other

13:52.360 --> 13:53.680
Google owned platforms.

13:53.680 --> 13:55.880
Remember the adpocalypse of a few months back?

13:55.880 --> 13:59.560
Where ad rates plummeted and despite YouTube's insistence to the contrary, never really recovered?

13:59.720 --> 14:03.280
Well, we've now entered into a second round of YouTube restriction, known as the limited

14:03.280 --> 14:04.280
state.

14:04.280 --> 14:07.920
In a recent YouTube blog post, titled An Update on our Commitment to Fight Terror Content

14:07.920 --> 14:11.720
Online, a number of methods YouTube uses to moderate their platform are described.

14:11.720 --> 14:15.200
I'm going to read a few choice sections for you, and try to give you an honest interpretation

14:15.200 --> 14:16.200
of them.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.200
Tougher standards.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.860
We'll soon be applying tougher treatment to videos that aren't illegal, but have been

14:20.860 --> 14:25.560
flagged by users as potential violations of our policies on hate speech and violent extremism.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.200
If we find that these videos don't violate our policies but contain controversial religious

14:29.200 --> 14:32.340
or supremacist content, they will be placed in a limited state.

14:32.340 --> 14:35.680
The videos will remain on YouTube behind an interstitial, won't be recommended, won't

14:35.680 --> 14:39.640
be monetized, and won't have key features including comments, suggested videos, and

14:39.640 --> 14:40.640
likes.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.640
So basically, the limited state is where YouTube is going to be placing videos that contain

14:43.640 --> 14:47.920
content that they consider to be controversial, even if the video breaks none of YouTube's

14:47.920 --> 14:48.920
rules.

14:48.920 --> 14:52.800
These videos will generate no revenue, and will garner no audience interaction or growth.

14:52.800 --> 14:56.720
YouTube could just boot these videos and their creators offline, but I think the people over

14:56.720 --> 15:00.640
there are smart enough to know that keeping up the pretense of YouTube being a free speech,

15:00.640 --> 15:04.520
free for all platform where people can hear from other people and not just approved sources

15:04.520 --> 15:06.160
is integral to their business.

15:06.160 --> 15:09.840
But it's also clear that YouTube does not want people who create this content around

15:09.840 --> 15:13.200
anymore, and this is them squeezing those content creators hoping they'll up and leave

15:13.200 --> 15:14.200
on their own.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.560
And this is happening right now.

15:15.560 --> 15:20.920
Mundane Matt's channel made $15 and 101,000 views, which is ridiculously low, presumably

15:20.920 --> 15:28.520
because he's a political YouTuber.

15:28.520 --> 15:32.640
The Act Man made a video on how we should all stop making racism and sexism an issue

15:32.640 --> 15:37.680
in video games, titled Feminists and SAWs vs Video Games, and he got a community guidelines

15:37.680 --> 15:39.240
strike for hate speech.

15:39.240 --> 15:43.080
Musical antiheroes been private messaged by another YouTuber who received this lovely

15:43.080 --> 15:47.920
message, limited or no ads due to content identified as not suitable for all advertisers.

15:47.920 --> 15:51.040
Upon requesting a review of this decision, he received this message.

15:51.040 --> 15:55.200
We are only able to review videos with at least 1,000 views in the past 28 days, so

15:55.200 --> 15:59.440
if you're simply not popular enough, you're not even able to have your video reviewed

15:59.440 --> 16:01.480
to see if it was placed in limitation and error.

16:01.480 --> 16:02.680
And it's happened to me too.

16:02.680 --> 16:06.380
I did a video a few months back, titled Is it possible to be a moral pedophile?

16:06.380 --> 16:10.200
In that video I discussed pedophilia from a rational, non-emotional point of view.

16:10.200 --> 16:14.860
I was not apologetic for pedophilia, of course, but I didn't resort to baseless insults

16:14.860 --> 16:18.640
or reactionary comments in my explanation of why I thought pedophilia was an obviously

16:18.640 --> 16:19.640
bad thing.

16:19.640 --> 16:24.620
But because I dared to discuss the topic at all, the video was deemed not advertiser friendly.

16:24.620 --> 16:28.260
It's my opinion that these moves on YouTube's part are directly linked to the Google Manifesto.

16:28.260 --> 16:31.100
It's no secret that YouTube is bleeding money like crazy.

16:31.100 --> 16:35.500
400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube's servers every minute, and the cost to maintain

16:35.500 --> 16:38.140
that amount of data is absolutely colossal.

16:38.140 --> 16:41.620
Every time somebody clicks a video, that's bandwidth and server strain that comes out

16:41.620 --> 16:42.620
of YouTube's pocket.

16:42.620 --> 16:45.740
And like Damore said in the Manifesto, Google's finances are not infinite.

16:45.740 --> 16:48.140
There's only so much ad revenue to spread around.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.540
I think that YouTube needs to start cutting costs in order to stay afloat in the long

16:51.540 --> 16:55.460
term, and one way they can do this is by giving creators a smaller cut of that revenue, through

16:55.460 --> 16:57.460
actions like the adpocalypse.

16:57.460 --> 17:00.780
Another way to do this is to put videos in the limited state described earlier, where

17:00.780 --> 17:04.680
no creator revenue will be paid out, and the video won't appear in search results and

17:04.680 --> 17:08.820
have no audience interaction, driving the number of views down, which in turn will drive

17:08.820 --> 17:11.540
down the strain on YouTube's servers, saving them a little bit of money.

17:11.580 --> 17:15.980
I think the limited state, in the coming months and years, will be expanded to large swaths

17:15.980 --> 17:17.780
of content as a cost-cutting measure.

17:17.780 --> 17:22.080
I think they're starting off with non-left political or anti-social justice content for

17:22.080 --> 17:23.120
a number of reasons.

17:23.120 --> 17:26.000
This content is relatively easy to identify at a quick glance.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.940
The community surrounding this type of channel is somewhat insular, so their loss will create

17:29.940 --> 17:31.220
minimal shockwaves.

17:31.220 --> 17:34.380
And because they're ideologically opposed to that content, which we already know to

17:34.380 --> 17:37.940
be the case with the Google Manifesto, it's like killing two birds with one stone for

17:37.940 --> 17:38.940
them.

17:39.940 --> 17:46.900
This connects to another point on YouTube's blog post about methods currently being taken

17:46.900 --> 17:48.220
to moderate the platform.

17:48.220 --> 17:50.980
Early intervention and expanding counter-extremism work.

18:02.980 --> 18:07.340
Well okay, when somebody searches, say, how to join ISIS, they're going to get videos

18:07.340 --> 18:10.420
related to why ISIS is bad, how to get help, etc etc.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.460
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

18:12.460 --> 18:14.540
But recall the Google Manifesto again.

18:14.540 --> 18:18.620
Recall Sundar Pichai's blog post describing the women at Google as hurting and feeling

18:18.620 --> 18:19.620
under threat.

18:19.620 --> 18:22.860
I do not trust YouTube's determination on what should be covered by redirection.

18:22.860 --> 18:26.540
This honestly sounds to me like in the near future we're going to be seeing a scenario

18:26.540 --> 18:30.620
in which somebody searches for anti-SJW on YouTube and the search fetches a bunch of

18:30.620 --> 18:34.740
social justice videos telling him that social justice is the superior ideology and that

18:34.740 --> 18:36.400
the people who disagree are bigoted.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.600
Or experts.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.340
Of course, our systems are only as good as the data they're based on.

18:40.340 --> 18:44.320
Over the past weeks, we have begun working with more than 15 additional expert NGOs and

18:44.320 --> 18:48.040
institutions through our trusted FLAGA program, including the Anti-Defamation League, the

18:48.040 --> 18:51.000
No Hate Speech movement, and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.440
Tell me Google, did you include Crash Override in that list of partners?

18:54.440 --> 18:57.680
You know, Zoe Quinn's organization, the one that was all about helping victims of

18:57.680 --> 19:01.040
online harassment, but specifically set out to harass people they disagreed with?

19:01.040 --> 19:06.080
You know, the harassers you invited to Google to get their opinion on how to stop harassment?

19:06.080 --> 19:09.240
Rather detection and faster removal driven by machine learning, we've always used a

19:09.240 --> 19:13.080
mix of technology and human review to address the ever-changing challenges around controversial

19:13.080 --> 19:14.140
content on YouTube.

19:14.140 --> 19:17.800
We recently began developing and implementing cutting-edge machine learning technology designed

19:17.800 --> 19:21.800
to help us identify and remove violent extremism and terrorism-related content in a scalable

19:21.800 --> 19:22.800
way.

19:22.800 --> 19:26.200
Oh yes, yes, we all know that Google's AI technology is cutting edge.

19:26.200 --> 19:30.540
Meet Perspective, Google's AI bot that will take comments and speech and tell you how

19:30.540 --> 19:31.540
toxic it is.

19:31.540 --> 19:37.100
Let's give it a go, shall we?

19:37.100 --> 19:41.340
The U.S. Government is Corrupt Oh, 71% toxic, is it?

19:41.340 --> 19:43.340
We'd better censor that opinion straight away.

19:43.340 --> 19:49.060
The U.S. Government is Wonderful Ah, 5% toxic, that's better.

19:49.060 --> 19:52.140
The word Trump all on its own is 42% toxic.

19:52.140 --> 19:55.700
If you're going for 100%, that's a gimme right off the bat.

19:55.700 --> 20:01.780
Black man dating white woman 86% toxic

20:01.780 --> 20:06.700
How many millions did you spend, Google, to develop an AI that disapproves of race mixing?

20:06.700 --> 20:11.100
If I hadn't made it clear by now, I don't trust YouTube to be objective in their policing

20:11.100 --> 20:15.700
of its platform, because of the extreme ineptitude of its staff and tools, its past behaviors

20:15.700 --> 20:20.040
when it comes to the DMCA, and because its parent company, Google, has an ideological

20:20.040 --> 20:22.780
stake in YouTube not being objective.

20:22.780 --> 20:24.060
But there is a silver lining here.

20:24.060 --> 20:27.740
The media has not completely united around Google in the way that it united around developers

20:27.740 --> 20:29.180
and press during Gamergate.

20:29.180 --> 20:32.620
Even though it's a very similar story of an insider publishing trade secrets that show

20:32.620 --> 20:34.620
illegal and unethical practices.

20:34.620 --> 20:38.820
Though there was that one idiot over at the Guardian that actually blamed this all on

20:38.820 --> 20:39.820
Gamergate.

20:39.820 --> 20:42.380
But okay, okay, that's enough stupidity for one video.

20:42.380 --> 20:43.660
Silver lining, silver lining.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.660
No, the Google manifesto isn't sexist or anti-diversity.

20:46.660 --> 20:47.660
It's science.

20:47.660 --> 20:51.140
Mr. Demore confirmed last night he was fired for perpetuating gender stereotypes.

20:51.140 --> 20:55.340
Despite how it's been portrayed, the memo was fair and factually accurate.

20:55.340 --> 20:58.800
Scientific studies have confirmed sex differences in the brain that lead to differences in our

20:58.800 --> 21:00.380
interests and behavior.

21:00.380 --> 21:04.860
As mentioned in the memo, gendered interests are predicted by exposure to prenatal testosterone.

21:04.860 --> 21:08.420
Higher levels are associated with a preference for mechanically interesting things in occupations

21:08.420 --> 21:09.420
in adulthood.

21:09.420 --> 21:13.420
Lower levels are associated with a preference for people-oriented activities in occupations.

21:13.420 --> 21:16.220
This is why STEM fields tend to be dominated by men.

21:16.220 --> 21:19.040
And this speaks to the regressive left's extreme problem with science.

21:19.040 --> 21:22.640
They only claim it as part of their domain when its outcomes agree with their ideology.

21:22.640 --> 21:26.280
But could climate change, you know, that thing that hard-left environmentalists repeatedly

21:26.280 --> 21:28.080
say that the science is settled on?

21:28.080 --> 21:31.240
Like here, over at Slate, climate science is settled enough.

21:31.240 --> 21:34.040
How long do you think it's going to take me to dig up a Slate article talking about how

21:34.040 --> 21:40.680
the Google manifesto is wrong and that science isn't representative of the truth?

21:40.680 --> 21:41.680
Well I'm back.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.440
It took me about three fucking seconds.

21:43.440 --> 21:47.280
Science is something that, when it agrees with the regressive left's worldview, is cool

21:47.280 --> 21:49.780
and awesome and worthy of upvotes on Reddit.

21:49.780 --> 21:53.080
But when it tells them that they're wrong, it's hateful and discriminatory.

21:53.080 --> 21:56.180
Remember that bit with the black student who thought a shaman could call down lightning

21:56.180 --> 21:58.840
and that the guy who told her she was wrong was racist?

21:58.840 --> 22:06.040
There's a place in Kabyalihana, and they believe that through the magic, the black magic, you

22:06.040 --> 22:10.560
call it black magic, they call it witchcuff to others, that you are able to send a lightning

22:10.560 --> 22:11.560
to strike someone.

22:11.560 --> 22:21.520
Yeah, isn't that a special brand of insanity?

22:21.520 --> 22:25.520
Well a bit later in the video, she talks about how science must be destroyed and remade from

22:25.520 --> 22:27.880
the ground up with her specific style of understanding.

22:27.880 --> 22:33.360
Western modernity is the problem that decolonization directly deals with, to say that we are going

22:33.360 --> 22:38.920
to decolonize by having knowledge that is produced by us, that speaks to us, and that

22:38.920 --> 22:41.760
is able to accommodate knowledge from our perspective.

22:41.760 --> 22:46.560
So if you're saying that you disagree with her approach, it means that you are vested

22:46.560 --> 22:50.280
in the Western and Eurocentric way of understanding, which means you yourself still need to go

22:50.280 --> 22:56.240
back, internally decolonize your mind, come back and say, how can I re-look at what I've

22:56.240 --> 23:00.560
been studying all these years, because Western knowledge is very pathetic to say the least.

23:00.560 --> 23:05.400
I from a decolonized perspective believe we can do more as knowledge producers, as people

23:05.400 --> 23:10.680
who are given the ability to reason or whatever, is that people say we do when we think or

23:10.680 --> 23:11.680
rationalize.

23:11.680 --> 23:16.760
So decolonizing the science would mean doing away with it entirely and starting all over

23:16.760 --> 23:20.440
again to deal with how we respond to the environment and how we understand it.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.000
Here's the problem with that.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.720
If your African scientists are worth a damn, they're still going to come to the conclusion

23:25.720 --> 23:27.320
that shamans can't summon lightning.

23:27.320 --> 23:31.160
The scientific process is the scientific process, and it does not change based on your culture

23:31.160 --> 23:32.480
or lived experiences.

23:32.480 --> 23:36.160
The nerd in me would now like to reference this Star Trek clip, just to show you that

23:36.160 --> 24:04.920
despite your ideology, science will always be correct about the nature of the universe.

24:04.920 --> 24:08.080
Beyond the science angle, people are also taking other stands.

24:08.080 --> 24:11.080
Demors filed suit against Google and I hope it goes well for him.

24:11.080 --> 24:14.520
I truly believe that the professional treatment of people who don't share the political views

24:14.520 --> 24:19.180
of their CEOs is serious enough to possibly consider it a civil rights issue.

24:19.180 --> 24:23.120
Some think that Sundar Pichai was in the wrong, so much so that he should step down.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.180
Others are talking about the free speech angle too.

24:25.180 --> 24:29.260
The application of hostile work environment law to workplace speech, including basically

24:29.260 --> 24:33.360
political or ideological discussions, not just vulgar jokes or unwanted personal talk,

24:33.360 --> 24:34.760
goes back decades.

24:34.760 --> 24:40.480
Jonathan Rauch, for example, in the New Republic in 1997, wrote that quietly, gradually, the

24:40.480 --> 24:44.280
workplace has become an exception to the general rule that in America the law does not seek

24:44.280 --> 24:46.320
to restrain wrongful opinion and expression.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.680
And Rauch explained the indirect mechanism by which this has come to pass.

24:49.680 --> 24:54.440
What the government cannot do directly, it now requires employers to do in its stead.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.040
Police discriminatory speech.

24:56.040 --> 25:00.000
It seems to me that conservatives aren't really all that welcome within Silicon Valley.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.040
I'm not even a conservative, and I can tell that rational conservative arguments are being

25:04.040 --> 25:08.520
snuffed out at major tech companies in the USA, in favour of feels-based, regressive

25:08.520 --> 25:12.960
left policies, as well as more than a few cry sessions after Donald Trump's election.

25:12.960 --> 25:17.480
I think political affiliation and opinion should be protected by law from firing in

25:17.480 --> 25:21.240
the same way as race, religion, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on.

25:21.240 --> 25:25.200
It's the only way to ensure diversity of opinion at these companies, which by the way,

25:25.200 --> 25:29.220
is far more important than surface level diversity like race and sex.

25:29.220 --> 25:32.760
And yet the higher ups at these companies just don't see that there's a problem with

25:32.760 --> 25:34.200
how they treat conservatives.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.680
The subject of Google's ideological bent came up at the most recent shareholder meeting

25:37.680 --> 25:38.680
in June.

25:38.680 --> 25:42.320
A shareholder asked executives whether conservatives would feel welcome at the company.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.320
Executives disagreed with the idea that anyone wouldn't.

25:44.320 --> 25:48.760
The company was founded under the principles of freedom of expression, diversity, inclusiveness,

25:48.760 --> 25:50.000
and science-based thinking.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.200
You'll also find that all of the other companies in our industry agree with us.

25:53.200 --> 25:56.680
Either they're entirely unaware of their horrendous and unethical treatment of people

25:56.680 --> 25:59.420
that disagree with them, or they just simply do not care.

25:59.420 --> 26:03.060
If this doesn't stop, I think we're going to see a balkanization of the tech industry.

26:03.060 --> 26:07.340
Talented young minds, not interested in working within the oppressive atmospheres of today's

26:07.340 --> 26:11.260
Google, Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook, will flee to alternative services and startups

26:11.260 --> 26:12.260
with potential.

26:12.260 --> 26:17.300
We're already seeing it, with Vidme, Gab, Vote, and Mines springing up as viable, growing

26:17.300 --> 26:18.300
healthy alternatives.

26:18.300 --> 26:22.000
I foresee a future in which there's two sets of social media platforms.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.360
The left will define the two as reasonable people versus bigots, while the rest of us

26:26.360 --> 26:29.940
will simply see them as hard left versus everybody else.

26:29.940 --> 26:34.140
The regressive left will continue to reinforce their echo chambers, perform witch hunts,

26:34.140 --> 26:38.420
and drive people away to the remaining social media platforms dedicated to free speech.

26:38.420 --> 26:42.240
And those platforms that remain out of their ideological grasp will be branded as hate

26:42.240 --> 26:44.600
sites with no value whatsoever.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.380
Two sets of services, two internets.

26:47.380 --> 26:50.360
And this will only be bad for the current social media giants.

26:50.360 --> 26:54.740
They have everything to lose in this future, and if it happens, they'll have only themselves

26:54.740 --> 27:24.560
to blame for it.

27:24.560 --> 27:29.100
Of course, considering the upcoming balkanization of social media, now is probably a good time

27:29.100 --> 27:31.560
to start getting on some of those alternative sites.

27:31.560 --> 27:35.500
I've already got a Mines account where I post each one of these videos, under the name,

27:35.500 --> 27:39.180
you guessed it, Short Fight Otaku, and I'm going to start looking at mirroring my work

27:39.180 --> 27:42.700
on Vidme as well, because I hear that's actually a very good YouTube alternative.

27:42.700 --> 27:44.620
Alright, that about does it for me.

27:44.620 --> 27:45.980
I'll catch you later, guys.

27:45.980 --> 27:46.500
I love you.
