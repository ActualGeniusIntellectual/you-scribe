00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
As of recording this video, one week ago, Google employee James Damore released a document

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,900
that went internally viral within the company.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,400
This document was titled Google's Ideological Echo Chamber, but has become colloquially

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,880
known as the Google Manifesto.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,320
I'm going to be referring to the manifesto throughout this video, but it's a bit too

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,760
long to simply read the whole thing.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,480
I highly recommend you go read it yourselves at the website googlemanifesto.com.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,000
I will, however, read the TLDR of it, just so you can get an idea of its content.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,420
Google's political bias has equated the freedom from offense with psychological safety,

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,780
but shaming into silence is the antithesis of psychological safety.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,540
This silencing has created an ideological echo chamber where some ideas are too sacred

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,540
to be honestly discussed.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,100
The lack of discussion fosters the most extreme and authoritarian elements of this ideology.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,540
Extreme meaning, all disparities in representation are due to oppression.

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,100
Authoritarian meaning, we should discriminate to correct this oppression.

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,540
Differences in distributions of traits between men and women may in part explain why we don't

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,540
have 50% representation of women in tech and leadership.

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,820
The question to reach equal representation is unfair, divisive, and bad for business.

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,620
I'm guessing you probably had the same reaction that I had when I first read it.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,820
Sounds reasonable, but oh boy is this guy in for a world of hurt.

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,820
And that's exactly what happened.

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,500
The Google employee who wrote the controversial Google Manifesto was fired after CEO Sundar

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,580
Pichai called it not okay.

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,820
And of course, because this guy just has to sound like a Twitter SJW, he would use the

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,340
phrase not okay to describe something that he's ideologically opposed to.

26
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,060
A Google engineer has been fired following the release of a now infamous diversity manifesto.

27
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,620
The engineer confirmed to Bloomberg that he was fired on Monday.

28
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,700
His writing has caused shockwaves across Google and the larger tech industry.

29
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,620
A source confirmed the firing, but a Google representative declined to comment on personal

30
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,620
matters.

31
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,660
CEO Sundar Pichai objects to the author's claims that biological differences make women

32
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,260
less suited for careers in tech.

33
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,700
Pichai suggests that this portion of the manifesto was not okay, and he said it went too far

34
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,580
by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.

35
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,020
To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited

36
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,340
to that work is offensive and not okay.

37
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,900
Now that's quite the claim for Demore to apparently make, that women are less suited

38
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,900
for careers in tech.

39
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,980
Let's look at the actual manifesto and see if it's true.

40
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,380
Possible non-biased causes of the gender gap in tech.

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,220
At Google, we're regularly told that implicit and explicit biases are holding women back

42
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,400
in tech and leadership.

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,780
Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the workplace differently, and we

44
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,060
should be cognizant of this.

45
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,420
But it's far from the whole story.

46
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,860
On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways.

47
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,360
These differences aren't just socially constructed because they're universal across

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,100
human cultures, they often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone,

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,360
biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,660
and act like males.

51
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,100
The underlying traits are highly heritable, they're exactly what we would predict from

52
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,820
an evolutionary psychology perspective.

53
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,280
I'm not saying that all men differ from women in the following ways, or that these

54
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,460
differences are just.

55
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,140
I'm simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women

56
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,140
differ, in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we

57
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,140
don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.

58
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,100
And in my opinion, here's the important bit.

59
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,700
Many of these differences are small, and there's significant overlap between men and women,

60
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,780
so you can't say anything about an individual given the population level distributions.

61
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,580
Here's a graph that seems to illustrate DeMoor's point a little bit later in the

62
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,180
manifesto, regarding how men as a whole seem to be predisposed to value higher status over

63
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,460
personal comfort.

64
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,580
The green looks like it represents men, and the purple women, and as an aside, nice callback

65
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,940
to gamergate buddy.

66
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,820
As you can see, the absolute upper echelons of men, the top tier, seem to be the pinnacle

67
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,140
of human potential in this regard, and they are there alone.

68
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,080
But the vast majority of men?

69
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,060
They're equal to the vast majority of women.

70
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,060
There is significantly more overlap of genders than anything else, and his second graph goes

71
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,820
on to show how only taking the raw mathematical averages of these cases misrepresents his

72
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,820
argument.

73
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,020
Do you think that Pachai's claim of advancing harmful gender stereotypes, and suggesting

74
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,180
that a group of colleagues have traits to make them less biologically suited for work

75
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,620
at Google is accurate to DeMoor's position?

76
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,820
Because I don't think it is.

77
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,420
In fact, if you look on DeMoor's graph, you can see a giant swath of people where

78
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,820
this is not the case.

79
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,620
But of course, DeMoor was fired from Google for authoring the manifesto, presumably for

80
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,620
wrong think.

81
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,620
Pachai stated that the memo violated Google's code of conduct, and Danielle Brown, Google's

82
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,640
new vice president of diversity, integrity, and governance, sent a statement to staff

83
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,980
condemning DeMoor's views and reaffirmed the company's stance on diversity.

84
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,780
So yeah, wrong think.

85
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,680
The memo and surrounding debate comes as Google fends off a lawsuit from the US Department

86
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,960
of Labor alleging the company systematically discriminates against women.

87
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,760
Google has denied the charges, arguing that it doesn't have a gender pay gap, but has

88
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,840
declined to share full salary information with the government.

89
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,480
According to the company's most recent demographic report, 69% of its workforce and 80% of its

90
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,920
technical staff are male.

91
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,720
Oh, oh, so there's really only two possible ways to interpret this.

92
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,360
DeMoor's assertions were in fact correct, despite Google's attempts to promote diversity,

93
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,400
or Google's actually run by a bunch of fucking bigots.

94
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,120
Well, it may very well be that the second answer, that Google is run by bigots, is actually

95
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
the right one.

96
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,000
But not in the way that you might be thinking.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,200
James DeMoor gave an interview to Jordan Peterson on August 8th, and what he has to say on the

98
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,600
subject is really striking.

99
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
Let's listen in.

100
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,920
I went to one of our diversity summits, all of it unrecorded and super secret, and they

101
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,160
told me a lot of things that I thought just were not right.

102
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,480
Okay, what do you mean unrecorded and super secret?

103
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:32,400
Well, I mean, they were telling us about a lot of these potentially illegal practices

104
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,360
that they've been doing to try to increase diversity.

105
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,160
What kind of practices?

106
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,120
Well, basically treating people differently based on what their race or gender are.

107
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Oh, you mean racism?

108
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Yeah, basically.

109
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
I see.

110
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,120
And it was ultra secret and unrecorded in what manner?

111
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,600
Yeah, so most meetings at Google are recorded.

112
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,520
Anyone at Google can watch it.

113
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,840
We're trying to be really open about everything, except for this.

114
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,240
They don't want any paper trail for any of these things.

115
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Okay, why?

116
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Because I think it's illegal, and I mean, as some of the internal polls showed, there

117
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,880
were a large percent of people that agreed with me on the document, and so if everyone

118
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,640
got to see this stuff, then they would really bring up some criticism.

119
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Yeah, well, a large number of people in Google and a very large number of well-informed biological

120
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,240
scientists we might also add.

121
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:44,760
So I mean, I was quite struck by your document, given that it would have been a decent document

122
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,960
for a well-informed psychologist, research psychologist to write, but you're somewhat

123
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,240
of an outsider, but you've got the highlights accurate as far as I'm concerned.

124
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,040
So okay, so you went to this diversity meeting, and you weren't happy with the sorts of things

125
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,000
that you were being told and with the practices, is that both correct?

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,760
What were you being told?

128
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,640
I mean, there's a lot of ways in which they pressure people to increase the diversity

129
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:22,960
of their team, and there's no way to do that besides actually choosing someone based on

130
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,680
their race or gender, right?

131
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,840
It's certainly also distressing to hear that there is acceptance of the idea that diversity

132
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,280
can be mapped onto race and gender, especially with regards to performance, because there's

133
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,480
no evidence for that whatsoever.

134
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,200
So okay, so you went to this meeting, and then you decided to write this document, and

135
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,600
how long had you been working on it before you released it?

136
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:54,920
Yeah, so I was doing it throughout my free time, and I just wanted to clarify my thoughts

137
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,800
on this, and I really just wanted to be proven wrong, because if what I was saying was right,

138
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,040
then something bad is happening.

139
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:09,080
And so about a month ago, I submitted it to feedback to that program, and I saw that people

140
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,640
looked at it, but no one actually said anything.

141
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,040
What sort of feedback did you submit?

142
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:22,680
I basically said what I said in the document, and then I linked to the document itself.

143
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:29,920
And so I actually published this about a month ago, and it was only after it got viral and

144
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,800
then leaked to the news that Google started caring.

145
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,360
Okay, so how did it go viral, and do you know, and how was it leaked?

146
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,680
Yeah, so there was a group at Google called Skeptics, and so I was like, okay, maybe they'll

147
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,920
be able to prove me wrong in some way.

148
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,960
Like they're skeptical about things, right?

149
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,080
I was naive, I guess.

150
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,200
And so I sent them a message like, okay, what do you think about this?

151
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,600
Is Google in some sort of echo chamber, or am I in an echo chamber?

152
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:13,720
And then it just exploded after that, and our internal, yeah, it was just spread throughout

153
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
all of Google.

154
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,960
And do you know, was it the Skeptics group that started to spread it around?

155
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:28,200
Yeah, and then there were a lot of upper management that, you know, specifically called

156
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,320
it out and started saying how harmful it is and how it's unacceptable.

157
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,560
This sort of viewpoint is not allowed at Google.

158
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,200
Yeah, what sort of viewpoint exactly?

159
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,800
The idea that there are differences between men and women that actually might play a role

160
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,480
in the corporate world?

161
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,440
That's an opinion that's not acceptable?

162
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,000
Yeah, it seems so.

163
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,240
Oh, so Google is racist and sexist, but apparently in the name of diversity, as in discriminating

164
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,320
against white men.

165
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,160
I know that the bullshit SJW definition of racism and sexism is prejudice plus power,

166
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,200
but legally that's not the case.

167
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,160
This is illegal, which is presumably why these meetings are unrecorded and not released to

168
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
the public.

169
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,200
It's no surprise to me that Sundar Pichai, Danielle Brown, and a couple of other Google

170
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,720
execs are regressive left ideologues.

171
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,120
This does seem to be the case at a lot of the big tech giants right now.

172
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,720
It's also no surprise to me that a lot of the underlings actually end up agreeing, at

173
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,920
least in part, with Demore's less ideological and more reasonable point of view.

174
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,920
An examination of the internal memos at Google while the manifesto was going viral, but before

175
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,400
it became public knowledge, shows that a number of employees do, in fact, question Google's

176
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,480
diversity at all costs stance.

177
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,320
But does anybody want to take a guess at how the news media decided to spin this story?

178
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,840
James Demore, the Google employee fired for his controversial manifesto, is almost certainly

179
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,120
not a victim of a free speech violation.

180
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,960
Why free speech couldn't save that Google engineer's job.

181
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,820
I'm a woman in computer science, let me lady-slain the Google memo to you.

182
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,600
How you can use the Google manifesto to advance women, not gender stereotypes.

183
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,320
Google firing its manifesto engineer is a powerful lesson in emotional intelligence.

184
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,640
And many, many more.

185
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,480
I don't need to go through them all with you, links are in the description if you want

186
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
to check them out yourself.

187
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,240
But all these articles revolve around three arguments.

188
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
1.

189
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,020
That the hurt feelings of the employees that found themselves feeling judged or ashamed

190
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,560
or misrepresented or whatever is more important than the factual accuracy of the manifesto.

191
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,560
2.

192
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,240
Keeping the ideology intact is more important than considering alternative points of view.

193
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
3.

194
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,520
That the first amendment protects us against government infringing on free speech, not private

195
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,400
organizations like Google.

196
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,920
Let's go over all three of these points.

197
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
1.

198
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,120
The reactions of many journalists, as well as the official reaction by Google's staff,

199
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,300
seems to consist of feelings over facts.

200
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,560
In doing so, these people obfuscate the facts presented within the manifesto.

201
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,880
General trends of large groups of people become specific statements about coworkers.

202
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,320
Talking about ways in which current diversity projects are failing becomes an opinion that

203
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,220
wants no diversity at all.

204
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,320
For an emotional reaction to be sufficient, things had to be blown out of proportion.

205
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,780
Fringe interpretations become the narrative that the media coalesces around, solely to

206
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,780
stamp out dissent.

207
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:10,080
But in reality, not only are the hurt feelings of employees not more important than the facts,

208
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,080
but these facts are distorted in order to generate the maximum amount of hurt feelings

209
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
possible.

210
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
2.

211
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,040
The Google Manifesto specifically states that the author, Demore, is not interested in being

212
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,180
anti-diverse.

213
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,720
It states that many women at Google are deserving of their positions due to their hard work

214
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
and dedication.

215
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,920
The manifesto advocates for a let-things-fall-where-they-may approach.

216
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,080
Rather than courting specific demographics in an effort for 50-50 parody, allow talent

217
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,840
to rise to the top solely on merit, and the women who have the merit will rise just as

218
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
well as the men.

219
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,800
Demore said specifically in the manifesto that he believes sexism exists, and that he

220
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,120
values diversity, but that Google's approach to the problem was wrong.

221
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,400
He advocated for treating people as individuals, not as just another member of their group.

222
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,080
The problem with this point of view wasn't that it was flawed, or that it was sexist.

223
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,160
It was that it went against the ideology of Google's top brass.

224
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,100
When everything is seen through the lens of victimhood, alternative opinions and solutions

225
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,160
to the problems of bigotry are also considered to be bigotry.

226
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
3.

227
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,000
The government does, indeed, protect against the government infringing on free speech.

228
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Not Google.

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,880
And unless you're part of a union, or you have specific stipulations in your hiring

230
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,380
contract that say otherwise, or it can be proven that your employer broke the law on

231
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,480
firing you, you can be fired for any reason.

232
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,640
Or even no reason.

233
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,960
Just like you can quit your job for any or no reason.

234
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,200
It works both ways.

235
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,700
It seems to be well within Google's legal rights to fire Demore for publishing his manifesto

236
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,160
on their internal servers.

237
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,000
That is a consequence of his free speech.

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,400
However, is it unethical of Google to fire him?

239
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,820
Considering that the manifesto is not inflammatory, it's not discriminatory, and it's backed

240
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,160
up by scientific fact?

241
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
I think it is.

242
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,700
It's legal, but also unethical.

243
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,520
And now that the public knows that Google, though entirely within their legal rights,

244
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,880
has acted unethically, should we use our own free speech rights to push back against Google?

245
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,120
Yes, we should.

246
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,360
But I don't think Google's going to allow us to do so, at least not on YouTube or other

247
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,680
Google owned platforms.

248
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,880
Remember the adpocalypse of a few months back?

249
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,560
Where ad rates plummeted and despite YouTube's insistence to the contrary, never really recovered?

250
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,280
Well, we've now entered into a second round of YouTube restriction, known as the limited

251
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
state.

252
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,920
In a recent YouTube blog post, titled An Update on our Commitment to Fight Terror Content

253
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,720
Online, a number of methods YouTube uses to moderate their platform are described.

254
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,200
I'm going to read a few choice sections for you, and try to give you an honest interpretation

255
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,200
of them.

256
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Tougher standards.

257
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,860
We'll soon be applying tougher treatment to videos that aren't illegal, but have been

258
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,560
flagged by users as potential violations of our policies on hate speech and violent extremism.

259
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,200
If we find that these videos don't violate our policies but contain controversial religious

260
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,340
or supremacist content, they will be placed in a limited state.

261
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,680
The videos will remain on YouTube behind an interstitial, won't be recommended, won't

262
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,640
be monetized, and won't have key features including comments, suggested videos, and

263
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
likes.

264
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,640
So basically, the limited state is where YouTube is going to be placing videos that contain

265
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,920
content that they consider to be controversial, even if the video breaks none of YouTube's

266
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
rules.

267
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,800
These videos will generate no revenue, and will garner no audience interaction or growth.

268
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,720
YouTube could just boot these videos and their creators offline, but I think the people over

269
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,640
there are smart enough to know that keeping up the pretense of YouTube being a free speech,

270
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,520
free for all platform where people can hear from other people and not just approved sources

271
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,160
is integral to their business.

272
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,840
But it's also clear that YouTube does not want people who create this content around

273
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,200
anymore, and this is them squeezing those content creators hoping they'll up and leave

274
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
on their own.

275
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,560
And this is happening right now.

276
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,920
Mundane Matt's channel made $15 and 101,000 views, which is ridiculously low, presumably

277
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:28,520
because he's a political YouTuber.

278
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,640
The Act Man made a video on how we should all stop making racism and sexism an issue

279
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,680
in video games, titled Feminists and SAWs vs Video Games, and he got a community guidelines

280
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,240
strike for hate speech.

281
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,080
Musical antiheroes been private messaged by another YouTuber who received this lovely

282
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,920
message, limited or no ads due to content identified as not suitable for all advertisers.

283
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,040
Upon requesting a review of this decision, he received this message.

284
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,200
We are only able to review videos with at least 1,000 views in the past 28 days, so

285
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,440
if you're simply not popular enough, you're not even able to have your video reviewed

286
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,480
to see if it was placed in limitation and error.

287
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,680
And it's happened to me too.

288
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,380
I did a video a few months back, titled Is it possible to be a moral pedophile?

289
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,200
In that video I discussed pedophilia from a rational, non-emotional point of view.

290
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,860
I was not apologetic for pedophilia, of course, but I didn't resort to baseless insults

291
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,640
or reactionary comments in my explanation of why I thought pedophilia was an obviously

292
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
bad thing.

293
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,620
But because I dared to discuss the topic at all, the video was deemed not advertiser friendly.

294
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,260
It's my opinion that these moves on YouTube's part are directly linked to the Google Manifesto.

295
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,100
It's no secret that YouTube is bleeding money like crazy.

296
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,500
400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube's servers every minute, and the cost to maintain

297
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,140
that amount of data is absolutely colossal.

298
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,620
Every time somebody clicks a video, that's bandwidth and server strain that comes out

299
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,620
of YouTube's pocket.

300
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,740
And like Damore said in the Manifesto, Google's finances are not infinite.

301
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,140
There's only so much ad revenue to spread around.

302
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,540
I think that YouTube needs to start cutting costs in order to stay afloat in the long

303
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,460
term, and one way they can do this is by giving creators a smaller cut of that revenue, through

304
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
actions like the adpocalypse.

305
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,780
Another way to do this is to put videos in the limited state described earlier, where

306
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,680
no creator revenue will be paid out, and the video won't appear in search results and

307
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,820
have no audience interaction, driving the number of views down, which in turn will drive

308
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,540
down the strain on YouTube's servers, saving them a little bit of money.

309
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,980
I think the limited state, in the coming months and years, will be expanded to large swaths

310
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,780
of content as a cost-cutting measure.

311
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,080
I think they're starting off with non-left political or anti-social justice content for

312
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,120
a number of reasons.

313
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,000
This content is relatively easy to identify at a quick glance.

314
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,940
The community surrounding this type of channel is somewhat insular, so their loss will create

315
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,220
minimal shockwaves.

316
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,380
And because they're ideologically opposed to that content, which we already know to

317
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,940
be the case with the Google Manifesto, it's like killing two birds with one stone for

318
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,940
them.

319
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:46,900
This connects to another point on YouTube's blog post about methods currently being taken

320
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,220
to moderate the platform.

321
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,980
Early intervention and expanding counter-extremism work.

322
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,340
Well okay, when somebody searches, say, how to join ISIS, they're going to get videos

323
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,420
related to why ISIS is bad, how to get help, etc etc.

324
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,460
That's not necessarily a bad thing.

325
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,540
But recall the Google Manifesto again.

326
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,620
Recall Sundar Pichai's blog post describing the women at Google as hurting and feeling

327
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,620
under threat.

328
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,860
I do not trust YouTube's determination on what should be covered by redirection.

329
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,540
This honestly sounds to me like in the near future we're going to be seeing a scenario

330
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,620
in which somebody searches for anti-SJW on YouTube and the search fetches a bunch of

331
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,740
social justice videos telling him that social justice is the superior ideology and that

332
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,400
the people who disagree are bigoted.

333
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,600
Or experts.

334
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,340
Of course, our systems are only as good as the data they're based on.

335
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,320
Over the past weeks, we have begun working with more than 15 additional expert NGOs and

336
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,040
institutions through our trusted FLAGA program, including the Anti-Defamation League, the

337
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,000
No Hate Speech movement, and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue.

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,440
Tell me Google, did you include Crash Override in that list of partners?

339
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,680
You know, Zoe Quinn's organization, the one that was all about helping victims of

340
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,040
online harassment, but specifically set out to harass people they disagreed with?

341
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:06,080
You know, the harassers you invited to Google to get their opinion on how to stop harassment?

342
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,240
Rather detection and faster removal driven by machine learning, we've always used a

343
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,080
mix of technology and human review to address the ever-changing challenges around controversial

344
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,140
content on YouTube.

345
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,800
We recently began developing and implementing cutting-edge machine learning technology designed

346
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,800
to help us identify and remove violent extremism and terrorism-related content in a scalable

347
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
way.

348
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,200
Oh yes, yes, we all know that Google's AI technology is cutting edge.

349
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,540
Meet Perspective, Google's AI bot that will take comments and speech and tell you how

350
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
toxic it is.

351
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:37,100
Let's give it a go, shall we?

352
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,340
The U.S. Government is Corrupt Oh, 71% toxic, is it?

353
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,340
We'd better censor that opinion straight away.

354
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,060
The U.S. Government is Wonderful Ah, 5% toxic, that's better.

355
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,140
The word Trump all on its own is 42% toxic.

356
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,700
If you're going for 100%, that's a gimme right off the bat.

357
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,780
Black man dating white woman 86% toxic

358
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,700
How many millions did you spend, Google, to develop an AI that disapproves of race mixing?

359
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,100
If I hadn't made it clear by now, I don't trust YouTube to be objective in their policing

360
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,700
of its platform, because of the extreme ineptitude of its staff and tools, its past behaviors

361
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,040
when it comes to the DMCA, and because its parent company, Google, has an ideological

362
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,780
stake in YouTube not being objective.

363
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,060
But there is a silver lining here.

364
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,740
The media has not completely united around Google in the way that it united around developers

365
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,180
and press during Gamergate.

366
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,620
Even though it's a very similar story of an insider publishing trade secrets that show

367
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,620
illegal and unethical practices.

368
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,820
Though there was that one idiot over at the Guardian that actually blamed this all on

369
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,820
Gamergate.

370
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,380
But okay, okay, that's enough stupidity for one video.

371
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,660
Silver lining, silver lining.

372
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,660
No, the Google manifesto isn't sexist or anti-diversity.

373
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,660
It's science.

374
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,140
Mr. Demore confirmed last night he was fired for perpetuating gender stereotypes.

375
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,340
Despite how it's been portrayed, the memo was fair and factually accurate.

376
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,800
Scientific studies have confirmed sex differences in the brain that lead to differences in our

377
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,380
interests and behavior.

378
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,860
As mentioned in the memo, gendered interests are predicted by exposure to prenatal testosterone.

379
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,420
Higher levels are associated with a preference for mechanically interesting things in occupations

380
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,420
in adulthood.

381
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,420
Lower levels are associated with a preference for people-oriented activities in occupations.

382
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,220
This is why STEM fields tend to be dominated by men.

383
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,040
And this speaks to the regressive left's extreme problem with science.

384
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,640
They only claim it as part of their domain when its outcomes agree with their ideology.

385
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,280
But could climate change, you know, that thing that hard-left environmentalists repeatedly

386
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,080
say that the science is settled on?

387
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,240
Like here, over at Slate, climate science is settled enough.

388
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,040
How long do you think it's going to take me to dig up a Slate article talking about how

389
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:40,680
the Google manifesto is wrong and that science isn't representative of the truth?

390
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Well I'm back.

391
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,440
It took me about three fucking seconds.

392
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,280
Science is something that, when it agrees with the regressive left's worldview, is cool

393
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,780
and awesome and worthy of upvotes on Reddit.

394
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,080
But when it tells them that they're wrong, it's hateful and discriminatory.

395
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,180
Remember that bit with the black student who thought a shaman could call down lightning

396
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,840
and that the guy who told her she was wrong was racist?

397
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:06,040
There's a place in Kabyalihana, and they believe that through the magic, the black magic, you

398
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,560
call it black magic, they call it witchcuff to others, that you are able to send a lightning

399
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
to strike someone.

400
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:21,520
Yeah, isn't that a special brand of insanity?

401
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Well a bit later in the video, she talks about how science must be destroyed and remade from

402
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,880
the ground up with her specific style of understanding.

403
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,360
Western modernity is the problem that decolonization directly deals with, to say that we are going

404
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,920
to decolonize by having knowledge that is produced by us, that speaks to us, and that

405
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,760
is able to accommodate knowledge from our perspective.

406
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,560
So if you're saying that you disagree with her approach, it means that you are vested

407
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,280
in the Western and Eurocentric way of understanding, which means you yourself still need to go

408
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:56,240
back, internally decolonize your mind, come back and say, how can I re-look at what I've

409
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,560
been studying all these years, because Western knowledge is very pathetic to say the least.

410
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,400
I from a decolonized perspective believe we can do more as knowledge producers, as people

411
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,680
who are given the ability to reason or whatever, is that people say we do when we think or

412
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,680
rationalize.

413
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,760
So decolonizing the science would mean doing away with it entirely and starting all over

414
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,440
again to deal with how we respond to the environment and how we understand it.

415
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,000
Here's the problem with that.

416
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,720
If your African scientists are worth a damn, they're still going to come to the conclusion

417
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,320
that shamans can't summon lightning.

418
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,160
The scientific process is the scientific process, and it does not change based on your culture

419
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,480
or lived experiences.

420
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,160
The nerd in me would now like to reference this Star Trek clip, just to show you that

421
00:23:36,160 --> 00:24:04,920
despite your ideology, science will always be correct about the nature of the universe.

422
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,080
Beyond the science angle, people are also taking other stands.

423
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Demors filed suit against Google and I hope it goes well for him.

424
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,520
I truly believe that the professional treatment of people who don't share the political views

425
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,180
of their CEOs is serious enough to possibly consider it a civil rights issue.

426
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,120
Some think that Sundar Pichai was in the wrong, so much so that he should step down.

427
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,180
Others are talking about the free speech angle too.

428
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:29,260
The application of hostile work environment law to workplace speech, including basically

429
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,360
political or ideological discussions, not just vulgar jokes or unwanted personal talk,

430
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,760
goes back decades.

431
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,480
Jonathan Rauch, for example, in the New Republic in 1997, wrote that quietly, gradually, the

432
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,280
workplace has become an exception to the general rule that in America the law does not seek

433
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,320
to restrain wrongful opinion and expression.

434
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,680
And Rauch explained the indirect mechanism by which this has come to pass.

435
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,440
What the government cannot do directly, it now requires employers to do in its stead.

436
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,040
Police discriminatory speech.

437
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,000
It seems to me that conservatives aren't really all that welcome within Silicon Valley.

438
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,040
I'm not even a conservative, and I can tell that rational conservative arguments are being

439
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,520
snuffed out at major tech companies in the USA, in favour of feels-based, regressive

440
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,960
left policies, as well as more than a few cry sessions after Donald Trump's election.

441
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,480
I think political affiliation and opinion should be protected by law from firing in

442
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,240
the same way as race, religion, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on.

443
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,200
It's the only way to ensure diversity of opinion at these companies, which by the way,

444
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,220
is far more important than surface level diversity like race and sex.

445
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,760
And yet the higher ups at these companies just don't see that there's a problem with

446
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,200
how they treat conservatives.

447
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,680
The subject of Google's ideological bent came up at the most recent shareholder meeting

448
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
in June.

449
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,320
A shareholder asked executives whether conservatives would feel welcome at the company.

450
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
Executives disagreed with the idea that anyone wouldn't.

451
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,760
The company was founded under the principles of freedom of expression, diversity, inclusiveness,

452
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,000
and science-based thinking.

453
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,200
You'll also find that all of the other companies in our industry agree with us.

454
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,680
Either they're entirely unaware of their horrendous and unethical treatment of people

455
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,420
that disagree with them, or they just simply do not care.

456
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,060
If this doesn't stop, I think we're going to see a balkanization of the tech industry.

457
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:07,340
Talented young minds, not interested in working within the oppressive atmospheres of today's

458
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,260
Google, Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook, will flee to alternative services and startups

459
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,260
with potential.

460
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,300
We're already seeing it, with Vidme, Gab, Vote, and Mines springing up as viable, growing

461
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
healthy alternatives.

462
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,000
I foresee a future in which there's two sets of social media platforms.

463
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,360
The left will define the two as reasonable people versus bigots, while the rest of us

464
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,940
will simply see them as hard left versus everybody else.

465
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,140
The regressive left will continue to reinforce their echo chambers, perform witch hunts,

466
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,420
and drive people away to the remaining social media platforms dedicated to free speech.

467
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:42,240
And those platforms that remain out of their ideological grasp will be branded as hate

468
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,600
sites with no value whatsoever.

469
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,380
Two sets of services, two internets.

470
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,360
And this will only be bad for the current social media giants.

471
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,740
They have everything to lose in this future, and if it happens, they'll have only themselves

472
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:24,560
to blame for it.

473
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,100
Of course, considering the upcoming balkanization of social media, now is probably a good time

474
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,560
to start getting on some of those alternative sites.

475
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,500
I've already got a Mines account where I post each one of these videos, under the name,

476
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,180
you guessed it, Short Fight Otaku, and I'm going to start looking at mirroring my work

477
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,700
on Vidme as well, because I hear that's actually a very good YouTube alternative.

478
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,620
Alright, that about does it for me.

479
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,980
I'll catch you later, guys.

480
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,500
I love you.
