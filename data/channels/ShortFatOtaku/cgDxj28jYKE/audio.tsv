0	20000	Have you seen this comic before? It's the new viral thing! Yeah, I love starting each video with the newest meme, not just for the sake of timeliness, but because oftentimes a meme is a meme because it resonates with people on an unspoken level, and what lies beneath is generally worth exploring in depth.
20000	28000	So, uh, if you're watching this video in 2023 because you've just discovered my channel and have decided to check out the backlog, sorry for the old meme, buddy.
28000	39000	This comic has a filthy fence sitter saying both sides make some good points. The blue guy, enraged that the white guy is not dogmatically agreeing with him, decides to push him over.
39000	49000	The red guy helps him up, and the blue guy accuses the white guy of siding with the bad guys. The joke is that the blue guy can't see that he was the one who pushed the white guy into the so-called bad camp.
49000	60000	There's a few problems with this, of course. The first is that the white guy does have agency. It's not actually blue's fault if white becomes red. Blue is responsible for what he does to white, but not what white does afterward.
60000	67000	The second is that this is actually kind of an unrealistic scenario in my experience. Being in the center actually plays out a lot more like this.
67000	73000	Yeah, red will certainly help you up sometimes, but when you criticize them, they often do default to behaving like blue anyway.
74000	80000	I guess it's important to note at this point that the colors are American-coded, with blue roughly mapping onto the left and red roughly mapping onto the right.
80000	90000	And the original comic is meant to be a commentary on how the left's dogmatism often pushes people who are centrists or undecided or apolitical or whatever into the right's camp.
90000	98000	While, yes, missing the point that the right often does the same thing anyway. Popular reaction to this comic among your rank-and-file lefties proves the comic's point.
98000	104000	So, if someone on the left is mean, you suddenly side with the racists? You are literally the comic, dude.
104000	111000	Never say that Twitter is just a bunch of people making up a guy and then getting mad at it. If the strawman exists, it's not actually a strawman.
111000	119000	I know people who are even just one atom left of center scream bloody murder at stone toss, but he also made a comic with the same point behind it.
119000	124000	Now that the purity spiral has progressed, even lefties are finding themselves targeted for not being left enough.
124000	129000	The thing that these same people told us would never happen five or ten years ago is now happening everywhere.
129000	135000	It's not like it hasn't happened before either. We're socialists through liberals and socdems under the bus as social fascists.
135000	137000	Yes, that video's coming eventually. It's in the render queue.
137000	142000	The purity spiral comes for everybody, but let's ask the question, why?
142000	147000	Recently, ContraPoints got fucking destroyed online over a tweet, yet again.
147000	149000	This time, the tweet was,
159000	166000	If you read this tweet carefully, you'll notice that ContraPoints doesn't even say that you can't be any of these contradictory things.
166000	169000	She only says that she doesn't understand how it works.
169000	177000	And that is apparently enough to be considered doing right-wing talking points by people more left than her, who are smelling the blood in the water.
177000	183000	She responded with a five-page manifesto explaining her larger point, and despite the mucho texto, I did read it.
183000	187000	She really sounds like she's holding back a bit of hate for her own audience here.
187000	189000	This ain't the first time it's happened to her, too.
189000	195000	And one of those other events led to her making an hour-and-forty-minute video about getting canceled back in January 2020.
195000	200000	Same thing with Lindsay Ellis. She's had to do multiple videos about all the shit her audience has come at her with before,
200000	206000	going so far as to say that the left cannot name the problem that plagues it, because doing so only gives the right power.
206000	212000	A friend of mine named it The Beast, the name for this fear that we all live under, but don't acknowledge.
212000	221000	And over the last few years, I have had so many of my colleagues, all of them women, people of color, trans people, queer people, or some combination of the above,
221000	229000	voice to me the constant anxiety that they live with about maybe saying something wrong that will get them on the bad side of their own communities.
229000	233000	Every thought is a hostage situation. Is this the tweet that's going to sink me?
233000	241000	So what do we call it? What is the name for this unspoken, unacknowledged culture of fear where we all know that one misstep can ruin our lives?
241000	247000	This social media culture where we participate in the public shaming one day and become chained to the pillory the next.
247000	250000	We can't even talk about it because The Beast does not have a name.
250000	255000	If we admit that this is a problem, then the right will just take it and run with it and use it to increase their own power.
255000	260000	Same as they did with cancel. Same as they did with woke. Same as they did with fake news.
260000	265000	If it has a name, then it has power. So it is a discussion that cannot be had.
265000	270000	And so we do not have it. We say cancel culture doesn't exist and ignore this disease.
270000	276000	Pretend it isn't doing real harm, not just to individuals who are targeted, but to the state of discourse in general.
276000	285000	And especially to individuals in marginalized groups because they are always held to the highest standard of purity and they always have the most to lose.
285000	288000	It isn't even about saying something tone-deaf or insensitive.
288000	295000	A mere difference in opinion might get you fired from your job if enough people raise a stink about it.
295000	305000	Lindsay Ellis is stuck denying that the problem exists, even as it ravages her, while being genuinely fearful of her own audience because she doesn't want to give an inch to her political opponents.
305000	310000	This has happened to Vosch multiple times. His audience turned on him over the Kink at Pride discourse.
310000	315000	Because despite the memes about him being a pedo, I don't think he's actually a pedo. He's just cultivated an audience full of pedos.
315000	327000	Like their minds have melted until they don't understand the difference between bringing a kid to a shopping mall and walking by Victoria's Secret and bringing a kid to Pride and seeing a bunch of dudes in leather fucking gimp suits being led around by a leash.
327000	335000	The idea to me that there are people in actual good earnest faith making the comparison between those two things is unfathomable to me.
335000	342000	This sounds like a trad take, not gonna lie. Mods, you can just ban everyone who says shut like that. None of these people belong in my community, okay?
342000	349000	Now, um, additionally, yeah, okay, cool, yeah, just absolutely, just purge, okay? Just remove, okay?
349000	353000	These people, they don't have arguments, by the way. They just want to be able to wave their dick around in front of kids.
353000	365000	His audience turned on him over the black supremacy is bad take because the sacrificing your principles to win ethic he's cultivated amongst his audience objected to that reasonable principled stance.
365000	372000	There's no way to remove a large racial group from a country without genocide. There's just no way around it. You can't like...
372000	384000	That's just not true. Like literally, I just gave examples of people in Africa who, like in Kenya, for example, like the way they got colonized people out is they retook the businesses that colonized people took.
384000	391000	And because they didn't have any economic interest in there, they left. Now, that's still not separatism because there's still white people in Kenya where they were able to...
391000	401000	To be specific, when you say that, do you mean all their possessions were seized and they were destitute and poor and had no choice but to leave the country?
401000	413000	Because if that's the case, well, depending on how much of the business you seize, you can end up reappropriating the entire economic foundation of an ethnic group, which is what we've done to black people plenty of times in this country.
413000	418000	So I know it works well at discouraging people from continuing to live in that area.
418000	425000	His audience turned on him over a relatively innocuous take on mindfulness because it sounded too bootstrappy for them.
425000	434000	And asking anybody to take any sort of responsibility for their actions rather than blame material conditions or historic oppression or whatever the fuck is apparently anti-socialist.
434000	453000	Not bootlicking discipline, not suck it up and don't complain about the problems in life discipline, but the ability to take stock of what's in front of you and to steal yourself and to do it.
453000	459000	I have described what I mean by discipline. There are people in chat who are willfully misinterpreting me because they are angry.
459000	465000	You people can shut the fuck up or you can get banned, okay? Because I'm getting really tired of your contrarianism.
465000	474000	And fuck, I don't even want to go over how often this happened to Shu Wan Head due to her 2014 era association with Sargon and Ai's extended friend group. I think at this point she's cancelled every day.
474000	481000	The thread that ties all of these events together is exemplified best in these comics. You might call it rules for thee but not for me.
481000	490000	You might call it a lack of principled standards. What that lack does to the community you cultivate and how it always leads to that community consuming you in the fires of the purity spiral.
490000	499000	And through examining these creators by noticing the it's never good enough tendency among their audiences, we might be able to actually answer that question.
499000	507000	Why does the purity spiral eventually come for everybody? Let me rapid fire a few scenarios at you and let's see if you can put together what's actually happening here.
508000	516000	1. New Mexico's tuition-free college plan would be among the most progressive in the country but student activists say it relies too much on money from oil.
516000	523000	2. All of you fucking ladder pulling, party abandoning, centrist fucks. All you Ian Austens and Jess Phillips types.
523000	531000	All you neo-liberals. This is on you. It's on you. Don't you dare pass the buck. And don't think we're going away either you twats. Buckle the fuck up.
531000	547000	3. A large part of the left is trying to convince the rest of us that we're wrong for expecting the most famous anti-feminist in the world who also spread and supported the most famous white supremacists on earth to own up to their bullshit before we accept them into our ranks or somehow we're not team players who are willing to coalition build.
547000	555000	IMO fuck these people. They are nothing more than sycophants who are simply trying to make themselves more popular without the backbone of doing the right thing. Let's stop pretending otherwise.
555000	564000	4. How knitters got knotted in a purity spiral, a process of moral outbidding is crowding small communities from within.
564000	577000	It's easy to see what's happening on the surface. People are traveling down the purity spiral, demanding others be more ideologically in line with them, ostracizing them when they're not, and breaking friendships, destroying communities, and closing off opportunities in the process.
577000	589000	Let's look at what's going on a bit more in depth. The first example is obvious. Progressives want free college. The underlying ethic is that they want to take the money from the rich to fund it, but because the rich earn their money in unethical ways, that money is now tainted.
589000	600000	In the second example, left-leaning voters, in this case, Labour because it's the UK, tell the centrists to get in line or fuck off. When the centrists choose to fuck off and Labour loses as a result, the progs are angry at being abandoned.
600000	611000	The third example is a subtweet at Shuon Head, one of millions I'm sure, where people who have non-left pasts aren't welcome on the left. After all, if you didn't come out the pussy reading Marx, you're not pure enough.
611000	622000	And the fourth is just an example of that one rule. Any institution not explicitly anti-left will slowly become left over time, which I personally view as a reflection of the inherently subversive nature of leftist politics.
622000	635000	In these four examples, you can all see the purity spiral in action, the continuing expulsion of those who are not like enough, until what remains is a tiny core of hyper-radicalized, impotent individuals who have destroyed the very thing they intended to subvert.
635000	647000	But why does it happen? Well, here's what I think is the answer. Consider the current debate in American politics right now over the $15 an hour minimum wage. I think you might actually be able to craft a pretty good argument for it.
647000	657000	You and I may not personally agree with that argument, but I can hear the logic in my head. The cost of living has gone up, but wages have stagnated. Inflation is slowly destroying people's savings and purchasing power.
657000	668000	Worker productivity is up, but those same workers are still getting paid the same amount. These are practical arguments. They're not appealing to some ideological political theory about the innate justice of a $15 an hour minimum wage.
668000	677000	They're talking about the current state of the world and how some things can be tweaked to be, in their opinion, more in sync with how the economy is currently changing. Fair enough.
677000	688000	You can disagree with their position while still seeing how it's pragmatic, not ideological. And because it's pragmatic, there's also a limiter on their policy prescriptions, a necessary endpoint for them to reach where they can say that the job is complete.
689000	698000	In this case, it would be something like, once the minimum wage has caught up to the rate of inflation, or once the minimum wage has resynched itself with worker productivity, then we can say it's a job well done.
698000	705000	Now let's compare that with the discussions happening about the $15 an hour minimum wage in a socialist ideological echo chamber.
705000	716000	In this case, there is no limiter on their policy prescriptions. There is no endpoint for them to reach where they will stop advocating. Because, in terms of game theory, they're playing an infinite game, not a finite game.
716000	720000	Yes, this is another video that uses game theory. I've found it pretty useful now that I've been reading about it.
720000	724000	A finite game is played for the purposes of winning. An infinite game is played for the purposes of playing.
724000	730000	The reason America lost in Vietnam, and now more recently in Afghanistan, is because the Americans were playing a finite game.
730000	736000	Their aim was to build an American friendly state and eventually leave, while their opponents were playing an infinite game. Survival.
736000	742000	In both instances, the Americans gave their opponents a pounding, far more than they took, but they still inevitably lost.
743000	754000	The socialist is always playing an infinite game. Their work isn't done with one minimum wage increase. It's not done with one worker co-op founded. It's not done with one market decommodified, or one country overthrown.
754000	761000	The practical reality of socialism, that collectivization must be forced on everybody all the time, makes achieving socialism an infinite game.
762000	773000	There's no necessary end point, no limiter on their principles, only an eternally long arrow pointing in a unitary direction, and any step in that direction is automatically a good one, no matter what it entails.
773000	785000	So, in this socialist echo chamber where $15 an hour is being discussed, there will be little practical consideration given to why workers actually need $15 an hour, or why some employers might not be able to give it.
785000	797000	Their arguments will be as simple as working class good. Therefore, when somebody shows up and says, hold on, why not $20 an hour? Why are we stopping at $15? Then $20 will eventually become the new dogma.
797000	803000	Worker good. $20 bigger than $15. There's no argument against it from their point of view, because they're ideological, not practical.
803000	809000	And if that's the case, why not $25? Why not $50? Why not $100? Why not $500?
809000	821000	In this environment, the person who remains advocating for $15 an hour, the person who has not progressed more leftward over time, the person who has, to use the obvious phrase, been left behind by the left,
821000	833000	will be cast out of the group as a fascist, alt-right, reactionary, Nazi, MAGA, Brexiteer, Trumpster bigot, even though he was welcomed and praised at the beginning of the game, because he did not progress along with the game's infinite nature.
833000	842000	In showing himself to have practical concerns about going higher than $15 an hour, he betrayed his practical nature to the others. He revealed his rejection of the ideological.
842000	847000	What's funny is, in terms of game theory, playing an infinite game is actually preferable to playing a finite one.
847000	859000	For example, a business built on infinite game principles ends up being far more resilient, because to play an infinite game you have to stop worrying about being the best or the winner, and start worrying about how to build self-sufficient structures.
859000	863000	Paradoxically, chasing victory lessens your chances of actually achieving it.
863000	874000	But the big downside of the infinite game is the purity spiral. If you can't convince those who are a part of your team to play the game on the same level as you, you will be forced by the nature of the game to do one of two things.
874000	883000	Drop down to their level, which will end up being the lowest common denominator, or purge them from your team. And the more ideological you are, the more likely it is you will choose to purge.
883000	891000	A team that routinely purges its own members can only continue to play the game using naked open force, as they no longer have the popular numbers they once did.
891000	898000	So, the Taliban is a violent minority that nonetheless rules Afghanistan. Same with the Vietcong. And in their own way, same with the progressives.
898000	906000	You can call it critical theory, you can call it social justice, you can call it progressivism, socialism, or leftism. But all of these groups and the people within them generally hate debate.
906000	913000	Even the debate bros like Vaush or Hassan, now that they've established themselves, they're a lot less likely to debate anybody who can actually knock them down a peg.
913000	919000	In the name of not platforming a fascist or whatever weak-ass argument they'd like to put forward. But that's not actually the truth.
919000	927000	Underneath that excuse is the practical reality that their ideology is totalizing. It has its own set of ethics, its own language, its own moral code.
927000	936000	And theirs is not the worldview of the liberal. Theirs advances itself virally, depending on us to play the liberal game of open debate, of tolerance, of the free marketplace of ideas.
936000	941000	They play it because it's advantageous for them to do so, and when it stops being advantageous, they stop playing it.
941000	947000	However, if we, as liberals, stop playing the liberal game, we ultimately become no better than them.
947000	952000	Conversation and debate are part of our ethics, but it's not a part of theirs. And I'm pretty sure I can explain why.
952000	959000	Have you ever seen nonsense like, white culture is rugged individualism, or emphasis on the scientific method, or work ethic before?
959000	962000	Yes, I will do a deep dive into critical theory on this channel at some point eventually.
962000	968000	But in terms of this conversation, what's being attacked here are what a lot of the progs call the master's tools.
968000	974000	Audra Lord, a feminist activist, wrote in 1984 that the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.
974000	980000	What she's saying here, specifically because she's a black feminist, is that the tools of whiteness will never dismantle whiteness.
980000	989000	Among progressives and socialists, this idea has become agnostisized over the decades to mean that the tools of liberal capitalism will never dismantle liberal capitalism.
989000	994000	Alison Bailey, another feminist activist, following in Audra Lord's tradition, wrote in 2017,
994000	1001000	the tools of the critical thinking tradition, for example, validity, soundness, and conceptual clarity, cannot dismantle the master's house.
1001000	1006000	They can temporarily beat the master at his own game, but they can never bring about any enduring structural change.
1006000	1016000	Bailey's point is that while critical theory is useful, it will never bring about the real change that socialists seek, because it relies on the liberal's tools for its analysis.
1016000	1022000	Those tools are explicitly named by Bailey as including soundness, validity of argument, and conceptual clarity.
1022000	1029000	Her objection extends to all corners of epistemic accuracy, science, reason, history, and yes, debate.
1029000	1035000	The master's house is liberal epistemology, and so the rationalist's tools can never dismantle it.
1035000	1038000	We're swimming pretty deep here, so let's come back up for a breath of fresh air.
1038000	1046000	The reason you've seen white culture is rugged individualism, emphasis on the scientific method, and work ethic is because they're actually talking about liberalism,
1046000	1050000	and those are the tools that liberal society uses to build and maintain itself.
1050000	1058000	In progressive theory, those tools can critique liberal society, but they cannot destroy it, and so socialists must reject those tools.
1058000	1064000	If this sounds like, on some fundamental level, an appeal to irrationality, it is.
1064000	1069000	Irrationality is how the rejection of ethics appears on the epistemic level.
1069000	1077000	And so when these people say, fuck my principles, I just want to win, the natural end result of that has to be a rejection of reason.
1077000	1085000	That's why there will always be a purity spiral, where the champagne socialists, the Prague darlings, get cast out and destroyed by their own audiences.
1085000	1087000	Their philosophy requires it.
1087000	1091000	The liberal point of view seems to line up with reality far more than the leftist one.
1091000	1097000	When there is this conflict with reality, the progressive and the socialist must fall back on the liberals' tools.
1097000	1106000	And when they do, those who are more ideologically extreme than them, but who have not yet encountered that conflict in their own life, have every reason to turn on them.
1106000	1112000	The purity spiral is not some sad accidental byproduct of leftism, it is a part of it at its very core.
1112000	1114000	It can't not be there.
1114000	1123000	If leftism is to be a revolt against liberalism, then on some level, it must also reject those components of liberalism that are most congruent with reality.
1123000	1128000	This ever advancing purity spiral is the leftist solution to that unsolvable problem.
1128000	1135000	We are lucky that, right now, we're only seeing it manifest as Twitter cancellations or the odd firing from jobs.
1135000	1139000	That's pretty bad, but as bad as it is, we've also seen it manifest in mass death.
1139000	1142000	And personally, that's not a road that I'm willing to go down again.
1142000	1146000	If a solution truly exists to this problem, then I think it's this.
1146000	1150000	Be a liberal. Reject any and all totalizing views.
1150000	1153000	The left is full of them, but the right has their fair share too.
1153000	1155000	And as a result, they have their own purity spiral as well.
1155000	1157000	Give the concept of purity its due.
1157000	1159000	It is a moral foundation, after all.
1159000	1167000	Which, personally, makes it very funny that leftists don't actually reject the concept of purity, they just replace the religious right's purity with their own form.
1167000	1171000	But even as you give purity its due, understand that it is not everything.
1171000	1174000	Again, reject the totalizing worldview.
1174000	1176000	Now don't get me wrong, you'll still be cancelled for it.
1176000	1178000	Cancelling is like coronavirus, everyone's getting it eventually.
1178000	1189000	But after you've been cancelled, once you're on the outside, and you've cultivated an audience of like-minded people who are also on the outside, who have also been cancelled, who also reject the totalizing worldview,
1189000	1197000	I think you'll generally find yourself in a better place, both in terms of your community, in terms of your friends, and in terms of your own mental health.
1197000	1200000	Say what you want about me, or Sargon, or whoever else.
1200000	1206000	But we never fear our audiences the way that Lindsay Ellis, or ContraPoints, or Vaush fears theirs.
1206000	1208000	Even when we disagree with them.
1208000	1211000	Alright, that about does it for me, thanks for watching friends.
1211000	1218000	I'll be streaming some more Life is Cringe when this video goes out, so make sure you hop on over to twitch.tv slash Game Boomers and check it out.
1218000	1220000	It is a lot of fun laughing at that trash fire.
1220000	1222000	Have a good day, and I'll see you there.
