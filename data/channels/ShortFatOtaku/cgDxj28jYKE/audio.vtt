00:00.000 --> 00:20.000
Have you seen this comic before? It's the new viral thing! Yeah, I love starting each video with the newest meme, not just for the sake of timeliness, but because oftentimes a meme is a meme because it resonates with people on an unspoken level, and what lies beneath is generally worth exploring in depth.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
So, uh, if you're watching this video in 2023 because you've just discovered my channel and have decided to check out the backlog, sorry for the old meme, buddy.

00:28.000 --> 00:39.000
This comic has a filthy fence sitter saying both sides make some good points. The blue guy, enraged that the white guy is not dogmatically agreeing with him, decides to push him over.

00:39.000 --> 00:49.000
The red guy helps him up, and the blue guy accuses the white guy of siding with the bad guys. The joke is that the blue guy can't see that he was the one who pushed the white guy into the so-called bad camp.

00:49.000 --> 01:00.000
There's a few problems with this, of course. The first is that the white guy does have agency. It's not actually blue's fault if white becomes red. Blue is responsible for what he does to white, but not what white does afterward.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
The second is that this is actually kind of an unrealistic scenario in my experience. Being in the center actually plays out a lot more like this.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Yeah, red will certainly help you up sometimes, but when you criticize them, they often do default to behaving like blue anyway.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
I guess it's important to note at this point that the colors are American-coded, with blue roughly mapping onto the left and red roughly mapping onto the right.

01:20.000 --> 01:30.000
And the original comic is meant to be a commentary on how the left's dogmatism often pushes people who are centrists or undecided or apolitical or whatever into the right's camp.

01:30.000 --> 01:38.000
While, yes, missing the point that the right often does the same thing anyway. Popular reaction to this comic among your rank-and-file lefties proves the comic's point.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
So, if someone on the left is mean, you suddenly side with the racists? You are literally the comic, dude.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
Never say that Twitter is just a bunch of people making up a guy and then getting mad at it. If the strawman exists, it's not actually a strawman.

01:51.000 --> 01:59.000
I know people who are even just one atom left of center scream bloody murder at stone toss, but he also made a comic with the same point behind it.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
Now that the purity spiral has progressed, even lefties are finding themselves targeted for not being left enough.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
The thing that these same people told us would never happen five or ten years ago is now happening everywhere.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
It's not like it hasn't happened before either. We're socialists through liberals and socdems under the bus as social fascists.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Yes, that video's coming eventually. It's in the render queue.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
The purity spiral comes for everybody, but let's ask the question, why?

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
Recently, ContraPoints got fucking destroyed online over a tweet, yet again.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
This time, the tweet was,

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
If you read this tweet carefully, you'll notice that ContraPoints doesn't even say that you can't be any of these contradictory things.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
She only says that she doesn't understand how it works.

02:49.000 --> 02:57.000
And that is apparently enough to be considered doing right-wing talking points by people more left than her, who are smelling the blood in the water.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
She responded with a five-page manifesto explaining her larger point, and despite the mucho texto, I did read it.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
She really sounds like she's holding back a bit of hate for her own audience here.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
This ain't the first time it's happened to her, too.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.000
And one of those other events led to her making an hour-and-forty-minute video about getting canceled back in January 2020.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
Same thing with Lindsay Ellis. She's had to do multiple videos about all the shit her audience has come at her with before,

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
going so far as to say that the left cannot name the problem that plagues it, because doing so only gives the right power.

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
A friend of mine named it The Beast, the name for this fear that we all live under, but don't acknowledge.

03:32.000 --> 03:41.000
And over the last few years, I have had so many of my colleagues, all of them women, people of color, trans people, queer people, or some combination of the above,

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
voice to me the constant anxiety that they live with about maybe saying something wrong that will get them on the bad side of their own communities.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Every thought is a hostage situation. Is this the tweet that's going to sink me?

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
So what do we call it? What is the name for this unspoken, unacknowledged culture of fear where we all know that one misstep can ruin our lives?

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
This social media culture where we participate in the public shaming one day and become chained to the pillory the next.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
We can't even talk about it because The Beast does not have a name.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
If we admit that this is a problem, then the right will just take it and run with it and use it to increase their own power.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Same as they did with cancel. Same as they did with woke. Same as they did with fake news.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
If it has a name, then it has power. So it is a discussion that cannot be had.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
And so we do not have it. We say cancel culture doesn't exist and ignore this disease.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
Pretend it isn't doing real harm, not just to individuals who are targeted, but to the state of discourse in general.

04:36.000 --> 04:45.000
And especially to individuals in marginalized groups because they are always held to the highest standard of purity and they always have the most to lose.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
It isn't even about saying something tone-deaf or insensitive.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
A mere difference in opinion might get you fired from your job if enough people raise a stink about it.

04:55.000 --> 05:05.000
Lindsay Ellis is stuck denying that the problem exists, even as it ravages her, while being genuinely fearful of her own audience because she doesn't want to give an inch to her political opponents.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
This has happened to Vosch multiple times. His audience turned on him over the Kink at Pride discourse.

05:10.000 --> 05:15.000
Because despite the memes about him being a pedo, I don't think he's actually a pedo. He's just cultivated an audience full of pedos.

05:15.000 --> 05:27.000
Like their minds have melted until they don't understand the difference between bringing a kid to a shopping mall and walking by Victoria's Secret and bringing a kid to Pride and seeing a bunch of dudes in leather fucking gimp suits being led around by a leash.

05:27.000 --> 05:35.000
The idea to me that there are people in actual good earnest faith making the comparison between those two things is unfathomable to me.

05:35.000 --> 05:42.000
This sounds like a trad take, not gonna lie. Mods, you can just ban everyone who says shut like that. None of these people belong in my community, okay?

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
Now, um, additionally, yeah, okay, cool, yeah, just absolutely, just purge, okay? Just remove, okay?

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
These people, they don't have arguments, by the way. They just want to be able to wave their dick around in front of kids.

05:53.000 --> 06:05.000
His audience turned on him over the black supremacy is bad take because the sacrificing your principles to win ethic he's cultivated amongst his audience objected to that reasonable principled stance.

06:05.000 --> 06:12.000
There's no way to remove a large racial group from a country without genocide. There's just no way around it. You can't like...

06:12.000 --> 06:24.000
That's just not true. Like literally, I just gave examples of people in Africa who, like in Kenya, for example, like the way they got colonized people out is they retook the businesses that colonized people took.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
And because they didn't have any economic interest in there, they left. Now, that's still not separatism because there's still white people in Kenya where they were able to...

06:31.000 --> 06:41.000
To be specific, when you say that, do you mean all their possessions were seized and they were destitute and poor and had no choice but to leave the country?

06:41.000 --> 06:53.000
Because if that's the case, well, depending on how much of the business you seize, you can end up reappropriating the entire economic foundation of an ethnic group, which is what we've done to black people plenty of times in this country.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
So I know it works well at discouraging people from continuing to live in that area.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
His audience turned on him over a relatively innocuous take on mindfulness because it sounded too bootstrappy for them.

07:05.000 --> 07:14.000
And asking anybody to take any sort of responsibility for their actions rather than blame material conditions or historic oppression or whatever the fuck is apparently anti-socialist.

07:14.000 --> 07:33.000
Not bootlicking discipline, not suck it up and don't complain about the problems in life discipline, but the ability to take stock of what's in front of you and to steal yourself and to do it.

07:33.000 --> 07:39.000
I have described what I mean by discipline. There are people in chat who are willfully misinterpreting me because they are angry.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
You people can shut the fuck up or you can get banned, okay? Because I'm getting really tired of your contrarianism.

07:45.000 --> 07:54.000
And fuck, I don't even want to go over how often this happened to Shu Wan Head due to her 2014 era association with Sargon and Ai's extended friend group. I think at this point she's cancelled every day.

07:54.000 --> 08:01.000
The thread that ties all of these events together is exemplified best in these comics. You might call it rules for thee but not for me.

08:01.000 --> 08:10.000
You might call it a lack of principled standards. What that lack does to the community you cultivate and how it always leads to that community consuming you in the fires of the purity spiral.

08:10.000 --> 08:19.000
And through examining these creators by noticing the it's never good enough tendency among their audiences, we might be able to actually answer that question.

08:19.000 --> 08:27.000
Why does the purity spiral eventually come for everybody? Let me rapid fire a few scenarios at you and let's see if you can put together what's actually happening here.

08:28.000 --> 08:36.000
1. New Mexico's tuition-free college plan would be among the most progressive in the country but student activists say it relies too much on money from oil.

08:36.000 --> 08:43.000
2. All of you fucking ladder pulling, party abandoning, centrist fucks. All you Ian Austens and Jess Phillips types.

08:43.000 --> 08:51.000
All you neo-liberals. This is on you. It's on you. Don't you dare pass the buck. And don't think we're going away either you twats. Buckle the fuck up.

08:51.000 --> 09:07.000
3. A large part of the left is trying to convince the rest of us that we're wrong for expecting the most famous anti-feminist in the world who also spread and supported the most famous white supremacists on earth to own up to their bullshit before we accept them into our ranks or somehow we're not team players who are willing to coalition build.

09:07.000 --> 09:15.000
IMO fuck these people. They are nothing more than sycophants who are simply trying to make themselves more popular without the backbone of doing the right thing. Let's stop pretending otherwise.

09:15.000 --> 09:24.000
4. How knitters got knotted in a purity spiral, a process of moral outbidding is crowding small communities from within.

09:24.000 --> 09:37.000
It's easy to see what's happening on the surface. People are traveling down the purity spiral, demanding others be more ideologically in line with them, ostracizing them when they're not, and breaking friendships, destroying communities, and closing off opportunities in the process.

09:37.000 --> 09:49.000
Let's look at what's going on a bit more in depth. The first example is obvious. Progressives want free college. The underlying ethic is that they want to take the money from the rich to fund it, but because the rich earn their money in unethical ways, that money is now tainted.

09:49.000 --> 10:00.000
In the second example, left-leaning voters, in this case, Labour because it's the UK, tell the centrists to get in line or fuck off. When the centrists choose to fuck off and Labour loses as a result, the progs are angry at being abandoned.

10:00.000 --> 10:11.000
The third example is a subtweet at Shuon Head, one of millions I'm sure, where people who have non-left pasts aren't welcome on the left. After all, if you didn't come out the pussy reading Marx, you're not pure enough.

10:11.000 --> 10:22.000
And the fourth is just an example of that one rule. Any institution not explicitly anti-left will slowly become left over time, which I personally view as a reflection of the inherently subversive nature of leftist politics.

10:22.000 --> 10:35.000
In these four examples, you can all see the purity spiral in action, the continuing expulsion of those who are not like enough, until what remains is a tiny core of hyper-radicalized, impotent individuals who have destroyed the very thing they intended to subvert.

10:35.000 --> 10:47.000
But why does it happen? Well, here's what I think is the answer. Consider the current debate in American politics right now over the $15 an hour minimum wage. I think you might actually be able to craft a pretty good argument for it.

10:47.000 --> 10:57.000
You and I may not personally agree with that argument, but I can hear the logic in my head. The cost of living has gone up, but wages have stagnated. Inflation is slowly destroying people's savings and purchasing power.

10:57.000 --> 11:08.000
Worker productivity is up, but those same workers are still getting paid the same amount. These are practical arguments. They're not appealing to some ideological political theory about the innate justice of a $15 an hour minimum wage.

11:08.000 --> 11:17.000
They're talking about the current state of the world and how some things can be tweaked to be, in their opinion, more in sync with how the economy is currently changing. Fair enough.

11:17.000 --> 11:28.000
You can disagree with their position while still seeing how it's pragmatic, not ideological. And because it's pragmatic, there's also a limiter on their policy prescriptions, a necessary endpoint for them to reach where they can say that the job is complete.

11:29.000 --> 11:38.000
In this case, it would be something like, once the minimum wage has caught up to the rate of inflation, or once the minimum wage has resynched itself with worker productivity, then we can say it's a job well done.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
Now let's compare that with the discussions happening about the $15 an hour minimum wage in a socialist ideological echo chamber.

11:45.000 --> 11:56.000
In this case, there is no limiter on their policy prescriptions. There is no endpoint for them to reach where they will stop advocating. Because, in terms of game theory, they're playing an infinite game, not a finite game.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Yes, this is another video that uses game theory. I've found it pretty useful now that I've been reading about it.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
A finite game is played for the purposes of winning. An infinite game is played for the purposes of playing.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
The reason America lost in Vietnam, and now more recently in Afghanistan, is because the Americans were playing a finite game.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
Their aim was to build an American friendly state and eventually leave, while their opponents were playing an infinite game. Survival.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
In both instances, the Americans gave their opponents a pounding, far more than they took, but they still inevitably lost.

12:23.000 --> 12:34.000
The socialist is always playing an infinite game. Their work isn't done with one minimum wage increase. It's not done with one worker co-op founded. It's not done with one market decommodified, or one country overthrown.

12:34.000 --> 12:41.000
The practical reality of socialism, that collectivization must be forced on everybody all the time, makes achieving socialism an infinite game.

12:42.000 --> 12:53.000
There's no necessary end point, no limiter on their principles, only an eternally long arrow pointing in a unitary direction, and any step in that direction is automatically a good one, no matter what it entails.

12:53.000 --> 13:05.000
So, in this socialist echo chamber where $15 an hour is being discussed, there will be little practical consideration given to why workers actually need $15 an hour, or why some employers might not be able to give it.

13:05.000 --> 13:17.000
Their arguments will be as simple as working class good. Therefore, when somebody shows up and says, hold on, why not $20 an hour? Why are we stopping at $15? Then $20 will eventually become the new dogma.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
Worker good. $20 bigger than $15. There's no argument against it from their point of view, because they're ideological, not practical.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
And if that's the case, why not $25? Why not $50? Why not $100? Why not $500?

13:29.000 --> 13:41.000
In this environment, the person who remains advocating for $15 an hour, the person who has not progressed more leftward over time, the person who has, to use the obvious phrase, been left behind by the left,

13:41.000 --> 13:53.000
will be cast out of the group as a fascist, alt-right, reactionary, Nazi, MAGA, Brexiteer, Trumpster bigot, even though he was welcomed and praised at the beginning of the game, because he did not progress along with the game's infinite nature.

13:53.000 --> 14:02.000
In showing himself to have practical concerns about going higher than $15 an hour, he betrayed his practical nature to the others. He revealed his rejection of the ideological.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
What's funny is, in terms of game theory, playing an infinite game is actually preferable to playing a finite one.

14:07.000 --> 14:19.000
For example, a business built on infinite game principles ends up being far more resilient, because to play an infinite game you have to stop worrying about being the best or the winner, and start worrying about how to build self-sufficient structures.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
Paradoxically, chasing victory lessens your chances of actually achieving it.

14:23.000 --> 14:34.000
But the big downside of the infinite game is the purity spiral. If you can't convince those who are a part of your team to play the game on the same level as you, you will be forced by the nature of the game to do one of two things.

14:34.000 --> 14:43.000
Drop down to their level, which will end up being the lowest common denominator, or purge them from your team. And the more ideological you are, the more likely it is you will choose to purge.

14:43.000 --> 14:51.000
A team that routinely purges its own members can only continue to play the game using naked open force, as they no longer have the popular numbers they once did.

14:51.000 --> 14:58.000
So, the Taliban is a violent minority that nonetheless rules Afghanistan. Same with the Vietcong. And in their own way, same with the progressives.

14:58.000 --> 15:06.000
You can call it critical theory, you can call it social justice, you can call it progressivism, socialism, or leftism. But all of these groups and the people within them generally hate debate.

15:06.000 --> 15:13.000
Even the debate bros like Vaush or Hassan, now that they've established themselves, they're a lot less likely to debate anybody who can actually knock them down a peg.

15:13.000 --> 15:19.000
In the name of not platforming a fascist or whatever weak-ass argument they'd like to put forward. But that's not actually the truth.

15:19.000 --> 15:27.000
Underneath that excuse is the practical reality that their ideology is totalizing. It has its own set of ethics, its own language, its own moral code.

15:27.000 --> 15:36.000
And theirs is not the worldview of the liberal. Theirs advances itself virally, depending on us to play the liberal game of open debate, of tolerance, of the free marketplace of ideas.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
They play it because it's advantageous for them to do so, and when it stops being advantageous, they stop playing it.

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
However, if we, as liberals, stop playing the liberal game, we ultimately become no better than them.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
Conversation and debate are part of our ethics, but it's not a part of theirs. And I'm pretty sure I can explain why.

15:52.000 --> 15:59.000
Have you ever seen nonsense like, white culture is rugged individualism, or emphasis on the scientific method, or work ethic before?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
Yes, I will do a deep dive into critical theory on this channel at some point eventually.

16:02.000 --> 16:08.000
But in terms of this conversation, what's being attacked here are what a lot of the progs call the master's tools.

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
Audra Lord, a feminist activist, wrote in 1984 that the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.

16:14.000 --> 16:20.000
What she's saying here, specifically because she's a black feminist, is that the tools of whiteness will never dismantle whiteness.

16:20.000 --> 16:29.000
Among progressives and socialists, this idea has become agnostisized over the decades to mean that the tools of liberal capitalism will never dismantle liberal capitalism.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
Alison Bailey, another feminist activist, following in Audra Lord's tradition, wrote in 2017,

16:34.000 --> 16:41.000
the tools of the critical thinking tradition, for example, validity, soundness, and conceptual clarity, cannot dismantle the master's house.

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
They can temporarily beat the master at his own game, but they can never bring about any enduring structural change.

16:46.000 --> 16:56.000
Bailey's point is that while critical theory is useful, it will never bring about the real change that socialists seek, because it relies on the liberal's tools for its analysis.

16:56.000 --> 17:02.000
Those tools are explicitly named by Bailey as including soundness, validity of argument, and conceptual clarity.

17:02.000 --> 17:09.000
Her objection extends to all corners of epistemic accuracy, science, reason, history, and yes, debate.

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
The master's house is liberal epistemology, and so the rationalist's tools can never dismantle it.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
We're swimming pretty deep here, so let's come back up for a breath of fresh air.

17:18.000 --> 17:26.000
The reason you've seen white culture is rugged individualism, emphasis on the scientific method, and work ethic is because they're actually talking about liberalism,

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
and those are the tools that liberal society uses to build and maintain itself.

17:30.000 --> 17:38.000
In progressive theory, those tools can critique liberal society, but they cannot destroy it, and so socialists must reject those tools.

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
If this sounds like, on some fundamental level, an appeal to irrationality, it is.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
Irrationality is how the rejection of ethics appears on the epistemic level.

17:49.000 --> 17:57.000
And so when these people say, fuck my principles, I just want to win, the natural end result of that has to be a rejection of reason.

17:57.000 --> 18:05.000
That's why there will always be a purity spiral, where the champagne socialists, the Prague darlings, get cast out and destroyed by their own audiences.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Their philosophy requires it.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
The liberal point of view seems to line up with reality far more than the leftist one.

18:11.000 --> 18:17.000
When there is this conflict with reality, the progressive and the socialist must fall back on the liberals' tools.

18:17.000 --> 18:26.000
And when they do, those who are more ideologically extreme than them, but who have not yet encountered that conflict in their own life, have every reason to turn on them.

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
The purity spiral is not some sad accidental byproduct of leftism, it is a part of it at its very core.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
It can't not be there.

18:34.000 --> 18:43.000
If leftism is to be a revolt against liberalism, then on some level, it must also reject those components of liberalism that are most congruent with reality.

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
This ever advancing purity spiral is the leftist solution to that unsolvable problem.

18:48.000 --> 18:55.000
We are lucky that, right now, we're only seeing it manifest as Twitter cancellations or the odd firing from jobs.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
That's pretty bad, but as bad as it is, we've also seen it manifest in mass death.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
And personally, that's not a road that I'm willing to go down again.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
If a solution truly exists to this problem, then I think it's this.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
Be a liberal. Reject any and all totalizing views.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
The left is full of them, but the right has their fair share too.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
And as a result, they have their own purity spiral as well.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Give the concept of purity its due.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
It is a moral foundation, after all.

19:19.000 --> 19:27.000
Which, personally, makes it very funny that leftists don't actually reject the concept of purity, they just replace the religious right's purity with their own form.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
But even as you give purity its due, understand that it is not everything.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Again, reject the totalizing worldview.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
Now don't get me wrong, you'll still be cancelled for it.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Cancelling is like coronavirus, everyone's getting it eventually.

19:38.000 --> 19:49.000
But after you've been cancelled, once you're on the outside, and you've cultivated an audience of like-minded people who are also on the outside, who have also been cancelled, who also reject the totalizing worldview,

19:49.000 --> 19:57.000
I think you'll generally find yourself in a better place, both in terms of your community, in terms of your friends, and in terms of your own mental health.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Say what you want about me, or Sargon, or whoever else.

20:00.000 --> 20:06.000
But we never fear our audiences the way that Lindsay Ellis, or ContraPoints, or Vaush fears theirs.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Even when we disagree with them.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
Alright, that about does it for me, thanks for watching friends.

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
I'll be streaming some more Life is Cringe when this video goes out, so make sure you hop on over to twitch.tv slash Game Boomers and check it out.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
It is a lot of fun laughing at that trash fire.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Have a good day, and I'll see you there.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I love you.
