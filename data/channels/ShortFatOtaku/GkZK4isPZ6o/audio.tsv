0	4000	Hi! I'm here!
4000	8000	Hello. We were just whinging about you being late.
8000	12000	Oh. Well, you know how it is, right? It's kinda normal.
12000	16000	Yeah, it's perfectly normal. That was what we were whinging about.
16000	20000	I gotta go tell everybody. Hold on a second.
20000	24000	I gotta actually let everybody know what's going on. I put out a video that said
24000	28000	come over in an hour, but I should probably just annoy everyone with a bunch of
28000	32000	everyone's. So, at everyone
32000	36000	the weekly sip is live.
36000	40000	Give me a second here. I'll post it on Twitter too.
40000	44000	Okay. That's cool. Thank you. Appreciate it.
44000	48000	So, how's it going?
48000	52000	It's going fantastic. Thank you for turning up to Shitpost
52000	56000	with me for a while, Dev. Yeah, no problem.
56000	60000	It's been a while. A year or two. It has been.
60000	64000	I think the last time we streamed together was
64000	68000	the follow-up interview for Exploring the Politosphere, which was
68000	72000	ages ago. Couple years, yeah.
72000	76000	Does everyone have their coffee? Wait, do you have your tea? I mean, you're a
76000	80000	BritBong, so you have to have tea. I drink neither, so
80000	84000	I am going to disappoint everyone with Pepsi bags.
84000	88000	What kind of a BritBonger doesn't drink tea?
88000	92000	One who actually has taste buds, Dev. Oh, you don't
92000	96000	like tea? No, not at all.
96000	100000	It's leaf water with milk and sugar in it.
100000	104000	That's honestly very surprising, actually.
104000	108000	And I don't drink coffee because I know if I start drinking it
108000	112000	on top. Listen, it's really good.
112000	116000	I'm sure it is, but that's exactly...
116000	120000	Oh god, I'm very coffee right now, and I don't mean to drink, I mean I'm coughing
120000	124000	a lot. I don't have the Coof,
124000	128000	though. I've already had it twice. I had, back in April 2020,
128000	132000	I had Coof One, Coof Original, and then
132000	136000	in October, I had the Delta
136000	140000	variant. So, people who say that the Coof isn't real seem to be
140000	144000	retarded, but it's not that bad.
144000	148000	Most people are so bad at that shit. I think I got Coof Two
148000	152000	Delta Boogaloo
152000	156000	a few months ago,
156000	160000	but it literally was just like a bad cold. Oh, did you get tested?
160000	164000	No, but I didn't get
164000	168000	any. I got symptoms that I
168000	172000	don't normally get when I get a cold or a flu.
172000	176000	And like, including like shortness of breath, which
176000	180000	only really, which only really, which means it was attacking my lungs, which it doesn't
180000	184000	never happens to me when I get the flu. Right, right.
184000	188000	I mean, I got tested and it was confirmed, so that's
188000	192000	I mean, oh god, you know,
192000	196000	it is sometimes hard to support those who are against
196000	200000	the current establishment when they say such ridiculous things as
200000	204000	COVID doesn't exist. And it's like, come the fuck on.
204000	208000	How, how much tinfoil do you have to be wearing to actually believe that?
208000	212000	Like you can, you can, you can, you know, wonder about vaccines, you can
212000	216000	complain about lockdowns because that's completely reasonable, but like
216000	220000	COVID doesn't exist seems to be a ridiculous position
220000	224000	to hold. At least I think so.
224000	228000	Here's the thing. I have only just recently got my first shot because I was holding
228000	232000	out for a while to see about, you know, like long-term effects and
232000	236000	whatnot. Yeah. But then they started, basically because
236000	240000	I'm a student and also I work in an industry
240000	244000	tangentially connected to the NHS, I was basically being pressured
244000	248000	on all angles, so I eventually just had to concede. Otherwise
248000	252000	I would have likely lost my job and been stuck
252000	256000	studying at home for another, for another term.
256000	260000	Another five years.
260000	264000	So I was like, you might as
264000	268000	well. And it's, so I only just recently got
268000	272000	the first jab, but it's fine. Like,
272000	276000	I don't necessarily have a problem with vaccines in general.
276000	280000	I just, I did feel there was a bit to be said about it
280000	284000	being rushed through trials and whatnot. Yeah.
284000	288000	So I just, so, so I got it
288000	292000	recently and it's been fine. The worst I got was that my
292000	296000	muscle was stiff. Yeah. See for me, what ended
296000	300000	up happening was like, I was considering getting it, but I was
300000	304000	also waiting for the trials to be done. And they, they finished up like this past summer, right?
304000	308000	I was like, okay, they seem to be like safe enough. All right, fine. Trials are over.
308000	312000	Nothing's really been uncovered. Nothing too crazy. Fine. And so
312000	316000	the, the plan was because I work from home
316000	320000	and everybody else who lives with me in this house, they don't. The idea
320000	324000	would be that, um, I, they would just get their shots first and
324000	328000	I would take care of them if something bad happened. And then once everyone else was
328000	332000	immunized, then I would get it. Um,
332000	336000	so everyone got their shots. And then when it came time for me to get mine,
336000	340000	the Ontario government announced the vaccine passport.
340000	344000	And I was just like, well, I'm not going to fucking comply with this. This is ridiculous.
344000	348000	So now, and honestly, now that I've had COVID, I don't really care. I've had the Delta variant.
348000	352000	I really don't care. Like there's natural immunity. Natural immunity is real. So
352000	356000	now I'm just like, I'm not going to lend any of my,
356000	360000	my own personal legitimacy, however little that might be
360000	364000	to a vaccine passport that I fundamentally don't, don't agree with.
364000	368000	So now I'm just not going to get it. Fuck it.
368000	372000	Yeah, I can totally understand that. Political jargon for $10.
372000	376000	Thank you very much. Fan of death. I don't have much to give, but here's some for a good cause.
376000	380000	Thank you very much. Um, anyway. Oh, I forgot to
380000	384000	I forgot to ask, what's the cause?
384000	388000	Cancer Research UK. What is that? It's a, it's a, it's a charity to
388000	392000	research cures for cancer. Oh, oh, you said cancer
392000	396000	research. I think you said council research UK and I was like, what?
396000	400000	No, Cancer Research UK. All right. Oh, oh,
400000	404000	so, uh, have you talked about what happened at the start of your show yet?
404000	408000	What do you mean? Well, I know
408000	412000	Aiden was supposed to be on. She messaged me and she told me, did she tell you what's going on? Why she didn't, why she
412000	416000	she was, she was late. Yeah. Wasn't it to do with something to do with her family?
416000	420000	Yeah, it was a family thing that came up. So she sends her apologies.
420000	424000	No, that's fine. I told her, I told her
424000	428000	I was less annoyed that she didn't turn up and I was more annoyed the fact that this is the
428000	432000	second time in a row she hasn't turned up. But I basically
432000	436000	I basically just told her that it was fine and not to, not to worry about it.
436000	440000	She's a really nice person, but I know that she, she gets
440000	444000	she, she has a tendency to like worry if people hate her. I've noticed.
444000	448000	Yeah, it's, she is a, she's a lovely lass, but she's just
448000	452000	it was, I was just, I was a little bit salty
452000	456000	at first, but then I just decided, cause fuck it. Yeah, right.
456000	460000	It's not worth getting salty
460000	464000	about. It's a 12 hour stream and we managed to get through the first topic
464000	468000	with just the, with the guests we had, so
468000	472000	it wasn't a bother. Yeah, fair enough.
472000	476000	Jesus.
476000	480000	Maybe I've got Omicron. I'm just going to get all the COVID's.
480000	484000	Oh, you, you dying? Kinda, I don't know why.
484000	488000	Actually, you know what it is? It's where I live.
488000	492000	Um, the climate, the specific climate in this like one location
492000	496000	in Canada is just dry. It's very, very dry
496000	500000	in the winter. Um, and you don't have this in the UK because it's just
500000	504000	a difference. Um, we get, we get cold
504000	508000	enough here in the winter in Canada that water can no longer evaporate.
508000	512000	Um, so it just freezes.
512000	516000	Water, so in the winter you'll have no clouds and
516000	520000	the sky is always sunny and blue, but it's like
520000	524000	minus 60 degrees Celsius out and the air
524000	528000	is extremely dry. So you just like, you're just
528000	532000	constantly coughing and, and Fleming because, and like everything is just dry.
532000	536000	Jesus, it's awful. For, for the most part here
536000	540000	it's like minus two in the middle of the night and it's like, like right now
540000	544000	it's four degrees Celsius. Yeah.
544000	548000	I'm not worried about global warming in the slightest because Jesus, it's so cold
548000	552000	here. I wouldn't mind a little bit. The thing is
552000	556000	with the UK is that where it is in terms of latitude
556000	560000	it should be a lot colder than it is, but we also get because of
560000	564000	where specifically, where we sit on the planet, we get, we get
564000	568000	warm current, warm air currents from the south, which heat up the
568000	572000	country all year round. So we're like a few, like we're like
572000	576000	a good, maybe five, 10 degrees hotter than we should be.
576000	580000	Well, the, uh, the west coast of Canada gets the same thing cause of the ocean
580000	584000	warm currents. So Vancouver right now is like our
584000	588000	early summer, you know, I'm just freezing.
588000	592000	It's like, all right, thanks.
592000	596000	But it's kind of interesting though, because I'm far enough north that
596000	600000	there's not much snow. It's all just ice. We have sheets
600000	604000	of ice that come down rather than snow.
604000	608000	The only person, the only person who knows what I'm talking about whenever I talk
608000	612000	about this with people is Arch cause he's in Norway. They have the same thing.
612000	616000	Fucking, I don't get how you can live
616000	620000	like if you don't, if you went much further north, you'd be living a fucking
620000	624000	Well, when I did live further north,
624000	628000	um, there were tunnels underneath some sidewalks
628000	632000	that allowed you to get to certain parts in the city really easily without having to expose
632000	636000	yourself to the air. And that's just how they do it when you go far north, I guess.
636000	640000	That's actually pretty cool. That's actually pretty cool infrastructure. I'd like to see that at some point.
640000	644000	Unfortunately, it was built with taxation, pal.
644000	648000	Fucking, don't go there. We're not having that conversation today.
658000	662000	I'm going to kill him with laughter and then I win the argument by default.
662000	666000	Is that how it works?
666000	670000	I don't know.
670000	674000	I'm pulling from the Jeremy Corbyn book of victories.
674000	678000	Hey, didn't he come out as based recently?
678000	682000	Was he being like anti-vax or like, sorry, anti-vacuum passport?
682000	686000	No, that was his brother, Pierce Corbyn. Oh, what's his deal?
686000	690000	He's basically, he, do you know
690000	694000	how all the lefty revolutionary larpers like hate anyone who's actually
694000	698000	revolutionary because it reveals their larp?
698000	702000	Sometimes. I have seen people like Castro though.
702000	706000	Basically, Pierce Corbyn is the
706000	710000	actual revolutionary to the larp revolutionary that is
710000	714000	Jeremy Corbyn. Okay. So when he's out there talking
714000	718000	about like burning down the houses of MPs or something?
718000	722000	Yeah, he's out there saying, we need to burn down the houses
722000	726000	of MPs. We can't put up with this anymore in response to like
726000	730000	like lot of facts, like COVID lockdowns and stuff.
730000	734000	He actually got arrested today as well. For saying that?
734000	738000	Yeah. Because it's considered, I think they said
738000	742000	it's considered cause to violence. Damn.
742000	746000	I mean, I guess it is technically if you think about it.
746000	750000	So basically he is the actual revolutionary to the
750000	754000	Jeremy Corbyn's larp revolutionary. Alright.
754000	758000	But he's coming at it from a left wing perspective I guess?
758000	762000	Yeah, he's a lefty revolutionary but he's like, he's
762000	766000	slightly more acceptable than the American progressive because he's kind of an
766000	770000	old school lefty English
770000	774000	old school English lefty, like this sort of
774000	778000	George Orwell type lefty. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you mean.
778000	782000	So I don't know how many weekly sips you've watched over the years.
782000	786000	I've done quite a bit of them, but the basic idea of the show
790000	794000	the basic idea of the show is
794000	798000	I usually shit post just talking with the chat and talking with people for
798000	802000	about half an hour. And then I do the
802000	806000	I do articles and I go over a series of articles. It's usually
806000	810000	a random number from a random time period. The idea is
810000	814000	over the course of a week I will research for various video topics
814000	818000	and I'll store them up and I'll store them away and I might not make those videos that week but I'll at least
818000	822000	store up the sources that I collect. However, when I find an article
822000	826000	that is interesting enough to be talked about
826000	830000	but does not actually fit into any kind of larger video
830000	834000	I put that aside and those ones that I've collected
834000	838000	for the week I do on the weekly sip.
838000	842000	That's the process of how I do this show.
842000	846000	Right, okay. I need a method
846000	850000	of seeing the things so you can either send me them
850000	854000	or you can screen share and I'll
854000	858000	screen feed Streamlabs. I should be able to screen share with you
858000	862000	let's see how it works.
864000	868000	720, oh jeez I can't do 1080.
868000	872000	God dammit. If I hit go live
872000	876000	there it is.
876000	880000	So there it is. Can you see that?
880000	884000	Hold on, I'll screen feed
884000	888000	there we are. You'll pipe it in? Yeah, now
888000	892000	they should be able to see it. Wait, why is Mitch saying
892000	896000	eww dev? Fucking, cause
896000	900000	Mitch is being a silly boy and he always
900000	904000	isn't. Isn't he the
904000	908000	guy who had the one like grossed out Pepe avatar
908000	912000	and he had to say that he's not cringe political opinions?
912000	916000	Yeah, that was his name for a while, not cringe political boast.
916000	920000	He's a
920000	924000	good boy. I like Mitch but. Yeah, I've talked to him once.
924000	928000	Yeah, he does love to take the piss
928000	932000	so does me.
932000	936000	Jeremy Corbyn actually voted against Boris'
936000	940000	plan B restrictions. Jesus.
940000	944000	Yeah. What a weird situation you guys are finding yourself in.
944000	948000	The thing is, you'll find that that is not
948000	952000	a principled opposition. That is an opposition
952000	956000	based in attempts at
956000	960000	getting popular. Because
960000	964000	the socialist wing of the Labour party
964000	968000	are on the defense right now because Keir Starmer
968000	972000	took over from Jeremy Corbyn and he's, I wouldn't say he's entirely a
972000	976000	Blairite but he's more of an election.
976000	980000	You're cutting out a bit for me, geez. I was just saying
980000	984000	he's more of a Blair, like
984000	988000	Keir Starmer's taken over the Labour party
988000	992000	and he's closer to a Blairite than he is to a Momentum
992000	996000	guy. He's not from the socialist wing of the
996000	1000000	Labour party. Right, right. And so the socialist wing of the
1000000	1004000	Labour party will just go against the, whatever
1004000	1008000	the Blairites do which, and the Blairites seem to be supporting the Tories
1008000	1012000	from lockdown stuff. Yeah.
1012000	1016000	So, I've collected my articles and here they are.
1016000	1020000	I think you'll like this first one. Right.
1020000	1024000	Because it'll probably, it'll probably tickle that
1024000	1028000	ANCAP funny bone of yours. So let's read it here.
1028000	1032000	These parents built a school app. Then the city called the cops.
1032000	1036000	Oh for fuck's sake.
1036000	1040000	Like, fuck you. Let people homeschool their kids.
1040000	1044000	No, no, that's not what it was. The official app was a disaster
1044000	1048000	so knowledgeable parents built an open source alternative.
1048000	1052000	Oh, I see. Oh, I like this.
1052000	1056000	Okay, so.
1056000	1060000	Christian Langren's patience was running out.
1060000	1064000	Every day the separated father of three was wasting precious time
1064000	1068000	trying to get the city of Stockholm's official school system to
1068000	1072000	work properly. Langren would dig through endless
1072000	1076000	convoluted menus to find out what his children were doing at school. If working out
1076000	1080000	what his children needed in their gym kit was a hassle, then working out
1080000	1084000	how to report them as sick was a nightmare.
1084000	1088000	I have done a big sip, Tidge. You missed it. Here, I'll do one for you right now. Hold on.
1092000	1096000	That's good stuff, man. Ah, yeah. Start drinking coffee.
1096000	1100000	It's good for you. Okay.
1100000	1104000	Two years after its launch in August 2018, the Skoll platform
1104000	1108000	had become a constant thorn in the side of thousands of parents
1108000	1112000	across Sweden's capital city. Commissioned
1112000	1116000	in 2013, the system was intended to make the lives of up to 500,000 children,
1116000	1120000	teachers, and parents in Stockholm easier, acting as the technical
1120000	1124000	backbone for all things education, from registering attendance to keeping a record of grades.
1124000	1128000	The platform was a complex system made up of three different parts, containing 18
1128000	1132000	individual modules that are maintained by five external companies. The sprawling system is used by
1132000	1136000	600 preschools and 177 schools, with separate
1136000	1140000	logins for every teacher, student, and parent. The only problem
1140000	1144000	is that it doesn't work.
1144000	1148000	It was a huge red flag when they said five different companies.
1148000	1152000	This tells me that this is an app that's been made by
1152000	1156000	committee, and anything made by committee tends to be shit.
1156000	1160000	Generally, you need a singular
1160000	1164000	coherent vision, and you can delegate
1164000	1168000	the creation of that vision to different people, but it needs to be a singular
1168000	1172000	vision. Video games actually have that problem quite a lot
1172000	1176000	as well, with a game being pulled in a thousand
1176000	1180000	and one different direction. It ends up
1180000	1184000	not fulfilling any of it.
1184000	1188000	You keep cutting out for me, man. Do you have an auto-closer on your mic?
1188000	1192000	I don't think so.
1192000	1196000	There's a way to set up in Discord.
1196000	1200000	User settings, voice and video, and then you'll have
1200000	1204000	automatically determine input sensitivity. If you turn that down
1204000	1208000	a bit, it might be a bit better. Hold on.
1208000	1212000	Sorry, where was it again? So user settings,
1212000	1216000	then voice and video,
1216000	1220000	and then it says input sensitivity,
1220000	1224000	and it says automatically determine input sensitivity.
1224000	1228000	You can slide. Because what it sounds like is at the end of your
1228000	1232000	sentences, when your voice goes a little bit quieter, it's cutting it off.
1232000	1236000	Wait, so
1236000	1240000	am I dragging it upwards or downwards?
1240000	1244000	It's left or right.
1244000	1248000	Am I dragging it left or right? If you go left,
1248000	1252000	then that should actually lower the noise floor.
1252000	1256000	So it shouldn't cut you off. Right, okay. Is that better?
1256000	1260000	It seems like it, yes. You already haven't cut off
1260000	1264000	once. Right, that's decent. Fair enough.
1264000	1268000	So to continue on, the Skoal platform
1268000	1272000	has cost more than 1 billion Swedish krona,
1272000	1276000	$117 million, and it's failed to match the initial
1276000	1280000	ambition. Parents and teachers have complained about the complexity of the system.
1280000	1284000	The launch was delayed, there have been reports of project mismanagement,
1284000	1288000	and it has been labeled an IT disaster.
1288000	1292000	The Android version of the app has an average 1.2
1292000	1296000	star rating. Oof, that sounds awful.
1296000	1300000	Just give me a second here. I love democracy.
1300000	1304000	I don't, but you know.
1304000	1308000	Okay, let me just keep reading.
1308000	1312000	Because this is a long article, we don't got to read all of it. I just kind of have the certain,
1312000	1316000	the certain bits. Yeah. So Lang Drin, he's a developer and the
1316000	1320000	CEO of a Swedish innovation consulting firm.
1320000	1324000	He has a hat, which was emblazoned with the words
1324000	1328000	Skrota Skoal platform, loosely translated as trash the school platform.
1328000	1332000	He joked that he should wear the hat when he picks his children up from school.
1332000	1336000	Weeks later, wearing the hat, he decided to
1336000	1340000	take matters into his own hands. From my own frustration,
1340000	1344000	I just decided to create my own app. Oh,
1344000	1348000	he's just going for it. He wrote to city officials asking to see Skoal
1348000	1352000	platform's API documents. While waiting for a response,
1352000	1356000	he logged into his account and tried to work out whether the system could be reverse engineered.
1356000	1360000	In just a few hours, he had created something that worked.
1360000	1364000	I had. Absolutely.
1364000	1368000	Absolutely based in innovation build. I had information
1368000	1372000	on my screen from the Skoal platform. Then I started building an API
1372000	1376000	on top of their lousy API. The work started at the end of
1376000	1380000	November, 2020, just days after Stockholm's board of education was hit
1380000	1384000	with a 4 million fine for serious shortcomings in the app.
1384000	1388000	Sweden's data regulator had found serious
1388000	1392000	flaws in the platform that exposed the data of hundreds of thousands of parents,
1392000	1396000	children, and teachers.
1396000	1400000	People's personal information could be accessed from Google searches.
1400000	1404000	That's what I'm saying. This school system just
1404000	1408000	doxxed a bunch of people. Fuck me, man.
1408000	1412000	Oh my god. Incompetence.
1412000	1416000	In the weeks that followed, Langdren teamed up with fellow developers
1416000	1420000	and parents and they hatched a plan. They would create an open source version
1420000	1424000	of the Skoal platform and release it as an app.
1424000	1428000	Building on Langdren's earlier work, they opened up Chrome's developer tools,
1428000	1432000	logged into the Skoal platform, and wrote down all of the URLs and payloads.
1432000	1436000	They took the code, which called the platform's private API and built packages so it
1436000	1440000	could run on a phone, essentially creating a layer on top of the existing
1440000	1444000	glitchy Skoal platform. The result was the
1444000	1448000	Opna Skoal platform, or open school platform. It was
1448000	1452000	released on February 12th, 2021. All of its code is published under an open
1452000	1456000	source license on GitHub. Anyone can take and use the code
1456000	1460000	with very few limitations on what can be done with it, what they can do with it.
1460000	1464000	If the city wanted to use the code, they could. But rather than welcome it with
1464000	1468000	open arms, city officials reacted with indignation.
1468000	1472000	Even before the app was released, the city government warned
1472000	1476000	Langdren that it might be illegal.
1476000	1480000	How is it illegal to make an
1480000	1484000	open source app? Probably because it's using like school information
1484000	1488000	or something. It's just going to be
1488000	1492000	governments mad that a private citizen did something better. That's what the story is, basically.
1492000	1496000	Well, that's what I mean. It's basically just
1496000	1500000	state mad that state got proven incompetent.
1500000	1504000	So, in the eight months that followed, the city of Stockholm
1504000	1508000	attempted to derail and shut down the app. It warned parents to stop using the app
1508000	1512000	and alleged that it might be illegally accessing people's personal information.
1512000	1516000	Officials reported the app to data protection authorities and
1516000	1520000	Langdren claims tweaked the official system's underlying code to stop
1520000	1524000	the app from operating at all. Then in April, the city announced it was
1524000	1528000	getting the police involved. Officials claimed the app and its co-founders
1528000	1532000	may have committed a criminal data breach and asked cyber crime
1532000	1536000	investigators to look into how the app worked.
1536000	1540000	The move took Langdren, who had been meeting with city officials, to address
1540000	1544000	concerns about the app by surprise.
1544000	1548000	Well, this is basically just like going, this
1548000	1552000	feels very like, very by the numbers
1552000	1556000	state action, just don't question us.
1556000	1560000	Question us and we'll, they're trying to make an example of this bloke because
1560000	1564000	he showed them up. Yeah. Basically like their solution sucked,
1564000	1568000	he made one that's better and they don't like that.
1568000	1572000	That's all it is. So, the
1572000	1576000	Opna Skull platform is not a complicated app.
1576000	1580000	While the official school platform is built for everyone involved in education in the Swedish
1580000	1584000	capital, its open source alternative is just for parents.
1584000	1588000	The one Euro app has been downloaded around
1588000	1592000	12,500 times on iPhone and Android
1592000	1596000	with an average 4.2 star rating and it only shows basic information.
1596000	1600000	Parents log in,
1600000	1604000	12,500 downloads for like an
1604000	1608000	education app, that's pretty good actually.
1608000	1612000	Parents log in using the Swedish digital identity
1612000	1616000	system bank ID, that already sounds fucking awful right there.
1616000	1620000	I didn't know the Swedes had that, but okay.
1620000	1624000	The bank ID is also used by the Skull platform. They can then see information about
1624000	1628000	their children that's pulled into the app through the Skull platform API. The app shows
1628000	1632000	school calendars and events such as music concerts, a daily schedule for pupils,
1632000	1636000	notifications from teachers that link out to grades and news updates, food that's being served in cafeterias,
1636000	1640000	and an option to report children that are sick. Everything that we
1640000	1644000	display is open and public information.
1644000	1648000	He explains that when the students grades are shown, they are displayed
1648000	1652000	through an in-app browser where the app can't access any data.
1652000	1656000	So basically they built an app
1656000	1660000	that took the data from the other app that was glitchy as fuck
1660000	1664000	and made it actually work. And that's why they're complaining.
1664000	1668000	They're complaining because they did something better. Yeah.
1668000	1672000	It really, this just really gets on my last nerve
1672000	1676000	because it treats, it's treating private citizens
1676000	1680000	like they're criminals just because they
1680000	1684000	had the nerve to innovate on
1684000	1688000	like build upon what the state was doing. Not even directly go against
1688000	1692000	the state, just build upon what the state had done and make it better.
1692000	1696000	Yep. Yep. Exactly.
1696000	1700000	And doing it, and not even using
1700000	1704000	state funds either. They did it like under their own time.
1704000	1708000	Yep. It's fucking, like this is just
1708000	1712000	it's peak pettiness and it really gets on my libertarian hackles.
1712000	1716000	I knew this would be the greatest, the great article to start with you.
1716000	1720000	So. It just, mmm. The city of
1720000	1724000	Stockholm was unsure about the official platform from the beginning.
1724000	1728000	We do not have open API, so they made their own solution.
1728000	1732000	It may be illegal because people's personal data is involved.
1732000	1736000	And even though Helen Mossberg, who is the
1736000	1740000	deputy head of digitization and IT at the city's education division,
1740000	1744000	claimed to be generally positive about the app, she still said that
1744000	1748000	a rigorous investigation was being launched.
1748000	1752000	In mid February, a Swedish security firm completed an external audit
1752000	1756000	of the app and the report was not published.
1756000	1760000	And then three weeks later at the end of February, the city said
1760000	1764000	it was making security updates to the Skoll platform to stop any potential personal
1764000	1768000	data from being accessed, effectively shutting down Apna Skoll
1768000	1772000	platform's home brewed API. This began
1772000	1776000	a tug of war between the two sides. The Skoll platform would be updated,
1776000	1780000	Apna Skoll platform would respond with its own updates. In March,
1780000	1784000	Apna Skoll platform was apparently updated seven times to avoid sabotage from
1784000	1788000	the city, which continued to change its underlying systems.
1788000	1792000	So it doesn't sound like the city is actually fixing any of the problems with the
1792000	1796000	app. This has been going for like two years at this point, but when it comes
1796000	1800000	time to, when it comes time to stop this competitive app,
1800000	1802000	they're, they're updating it like crazy.
1802000	1806000	Well, that's what I mean. They're not trying to, they're doing this
1806000	1810000	out of spite. It's painless. They're doing it. They
1810000	1814000	would rather the app be actively worse to use
1814000	1818000	as long as a private citizen wasn't the one to make it.
1818000	1822000	Yep. Do not pretend to tell me that the
1822000	1826000	state cares about you. In early April,
1826000	1830000	the city asked the developers to unpublish their source code from
1830000	1834000	GitHub. On April 15th, the Education Administration
1834000	1838000	announced it had completed its investigation into the parent developed system and had
1838000	1842000	concerns about how the app handled data. The city then reported the developers
1842000	1846000	and Apna Skoll platform into the police, saying that it believed a
1846000	1850000	data breach had occurred. They wrote the police report
1850000	1854000	in a way that was supposed to look scary. That says, says Langdon.
1854000	1858000	In the following weeks, Cybercom investigators came to his house and interviewed him about the open source app,
1858000	1862000	a process that Langdon says caused him to doubt the work the team had done.
1862000	1866000	You have to make a decision at that point on what you're trying to do. He ultimately
1866000	1870000	decided to keep working on the project along with an expanding team as they believed it was
1870000	1874000	the right thing to do. As the dispute was unfolding,
1874000	1878000	Apna Skoll platform continued growing in popularity,
1878000	1882000	including a swell the number of people involved in its development. So now
1882000	1886000	they have 40 people working on this app because it's so popular and apparently it's at least
1886000	1890000	it's at least kind of financially solvent, probably not for all 40 of them, but
1890000	1894000	people want this basically. The volunteers have
1894000	1898000	found and squashed bugs, developed a search feature, and
1898000	1902000	translated the app into different languages. They also raised
1902000	1906000	potential security issues with the official app, even as the city worked against them.
1906000	1910000	All right.
1910000	1914000	I know you're trying to sue us, I know you're trying to sue us out of
1914000	1918000	existence and possibly get me arrested, but here's why your app is shit.
1918000	1922000	Yep. So it seems like
1922000	1926000	in the end, they won
1926000	1930000	because Apna Skoll platformer had to wait months to be cleared.
1930000	1934000	We do not believe anything criminal has been committed,
1934000	1938000	said the leader of the police's preliminary investigation, and the
1938000	1942000	data regulator in Sweden did not open an investigation into the city's complaint.
1942000	1946000	So it seems like the city lost this one, at least so far.
1946000	1950000	Based.
1950000	1954000	However,
1954000	1958000	things changed in September. Langdon was traveling to his brother's
1958000	1962000	wedding in France when he got a phone call. The city was changing
1962000	1966000	actually, no, no, this is when it got better. The city was changing its position on
1966000	1970000	Apna Skoll platform and any other app seeking to do similar things and decided to let
1970000	1974000	others access the data within its systems. To do so, the city struck
1974000	1978000	a deal with an external provider that will be able to set up licenses between
1978000	1982000	Apna Skoll platform and the city. So now the city
1982000	1986000	can guarantee that private data is handled in a correct and secure way while
1986000	1990000	parents can take part in the market's digital tools in their everyday lives.
1990000	1994000	See, I have a feeling that governments would just generally be better
1994000	1998000	off if they allow this kind of economic activity to happen
1998000	2002000	and just be like, listen, you can just pay us a cut and we won't fucking bother you.
2002000	2006000	Better than like fighting their own populace, you know what I mean?
2006000	2010000	Well yeah, basically if they
2010000	2014000	allow the populace to get involved in the streamlining of state activity
2014000	2018000	not only will it save them time, it will save them money
2018000	2022000	and it will avoid a lot of the
2022000	2026000	complications that come with government bureaucracy and inefficiency.
2026000	2030000	Like, here's the thing, I am a pragmatist, I might
2030000	2034000	be an anarcho-capitalist, but if a state is going to exist, I want that state
2034000	2038000	to be as streamlined and efficient and cost-effective as possible.
2038000	2042000	So, I think this is ultimately
2042000	2046000	like, as an achievable political goal, this is probably an incredibly
2046000	2050000	good thing. It's something that should be emulated elsewhere.
2050000	2054000	I mean, at the end of the article Langren says that all
2054000	2058000	officials should make their APIs open source so citizens can build technology
2058000	2062000	that works for them. If you build the API, the app will come. And
2062000	2066000	I can understand the security complaint. That's reasonable. You don't want
2066000	2070000	people getting a hold of your child's schedule or something. Yeah, fair enough.
2070000	2074000	But I also understand the other side of it too, you know?
2074000	2078000	There's a reasonable conversation to have here that isn't just
2078000	2082000	shut it down. To be fair, the original
2082000	2086000	state-built one was doxxing people so
2086000	2090000	they don't really have a leg to stand on on security. That's true. They were
2090000	2094000	also failing at it. But just because they were failing at it, that doesn't mean that it's also not a legitimate
2094000	2098000	question to ask. You know what I mean?
2098000	2102000	Yeah, I suppose. But I'm just saying that
2102000	2106000	being a part of the state apparatus does not
2106000	2110000	exempt you from... That kind of incompetence? Yes.
2110000	2114000	Not just that incompetence, but also from being a
2114000	2118000	security threat yourself. Right, right. So that's pretty much the end of that
2118000	2122000	story. I knew you would enjoy that one. I did,
2122000	2126000	so thank you very much. Okay, what's the next one? Oh!
2126000	2130000	Oh, you guys are going to love this! You guys are going to love this.
2130000	2134000	Do you remember Thirsty Sword Lesbians?
2134000	2138000	I don't, but elaborate, please.
2138000	2142000	I covered it on the show a couple months ago. It was a tabletop RPG
2142000	2146000	rule set that was only for
2146000	2150000	lesbians. If you weren't a lesbian, you couldn't play.
2150000	2154000	And of course they have all the things like, fascists can't play this game. You know what I mean, right?
2154000	2158000	You know what I'm talking about. You know the kind of thing I'm talking about.
2158000	2162000	Woke tabletop. Yes.
2162000	2166000	So, they have announced their
2166000	2170000	Woke First expansion. They're now
2170000	2174000	kickstarting Advanced Lovers and Lesbians.
2174000	2178000	Draw your sword and bare your heart with new character types, fresh
2178000	2182000	settings, and even more ways to enjoy Thirsty
2182000	2186000	Sword Lesbians. This Kickstarter received $97,000.
2186000	2190000	How? How? How? Why?
2190000	2194000	Why does this exist? Oh, it makes
2194000	2198000	me angry just looking at it. No, cause look,
2198000	2202000	why would people waste a hundred grand on something like this?
2202000	2206000	Like...
2206000	2210000	Look. Okay, let me read it. Let me read it.
2210000	2214000	Draw your sword and bare your heart with this new print supplement for
2214000	2218000	Thirsty Sword Lesbians. Ten new character playbooks, four adventures, twenty
2218000	2222000	plus settings, and a toolbox full of inspirational mechanics that will take
2222000	2226000	your game to the next level. And Advanced Lovers and Lesbians.
2226000	2230000	Wow. Dude, do you see this image?
2230000	2234000	Can I make it bigger? Hold on.
2234000	2238000	That's gross.
2238000	2242000	That's legitimately gross.
2242000	2246000	Looking at it, some of it's
2246000	2250000	fine. The art isn't bad, but freaking
2250000	2254000	I don't know. A lot of the characters just seem to be drawn
2254000	2258000	to be so deliberately off-putting.
2258000	2262000	I don't know what it is. Well, it's made by the company Gay Spaceship
2262000	2266000	Games, and if I zoom in enough, can you see this?
2266000	2270000	Right there. Actually, hold on. I'll need to pull up.
2270000	2274000	Just give me a second.
2274000	2278000	Okay. So, the original Thirsty
2278000	2282000	Sword Lesbians had official artwork
2282000	2286000	of this. And there it is.
2286000	2290000	And yeah, the characters are pretty ugly. However,
2290000	2294000	what's interesting is that they are clearly
2294000	2298000	and obviously aping the design of a
2298000	2302000	reasonably obscure 1990s anime
2302000	2306000	called Revolutionary Girl Utena. And I'll show you what I mean.
2306000	2310000	Nobody fucking watches Revolutionary Girl Utena anymore. That was like
2310000	2314000	made in 96. That's what I'm saying. I've heard of Utena.
2314000	2318000	Right. So, here's Utena.
2318000	2322000	Hold on. Can I get a better picture than that? Come on, internet.
2322000	2326000	Okay. Here's Utena.
2326000	2330000	It's clearly the same kind of design, but the characters are significantly more
2330000	2334000	appealing. I'm not seeing it, bud. I think you're gonna need to zoom.
2334000	2338000	No. Are you sure? Yeah, I think you need to
2338000	2342000	zoom out, bud. Zoom out? This is... Okay, hold on.
2342000	2346000	That's just... Yeah. What do you mean? I'm not seeing
2346000	2350000	this picture of Revolutionary Girl Utena. Oh, you're not?
2350000	2354000	I wonder why. Hold on.
2354000	2358000	Why isn't it... No, it's not giving you the...
2358000	2362000	It's only... I think it's only showing one window. Okay, hold on.
2362000	2366000	If I did this... Yeah, that's good. Okay, so this is
2366000	2370000	the Thirsty Sword Lesbians box art, okay?
2370000	2374000	Right. And this is the Utena art.
2374000	2378000	Oh, I see. That actually looks good
2378000	2382000	and appealing. And the thing is, by today's
2382000	2386000	standards, Utena is a reasonably left-leaning anime.
2386000	2390000	Like, it wears its feminism on its sleeve. Like, if
2390000	2394000	you wanted to point out what is a feminist anime, it would be this show.
2394000	2398000	For sure. However... However, it's still
2398000	2402000	actually very good because the characters are well developed and there's like an actual full story arc and they go
2402000	2406000	through troubles. The main hero loses fights and has to come back. Like, it's
2406000	2410000	not just all Mary Sue bullshit. It's... You can have
2410000	2414000	good feminist or even socialist or any
2414000	2418000	brand of left-leaning storytelling. You can still have that
2418000	2422000	but I think there's a reason we haven't seen it in about 20 years.
2422000	2426000	Well, let's take something like...
2426000	2430000	Let's take something a lot more Western and live-action like Law & Order, for example.
2430000	2434000	If you listen to any political discussion on the show, Law & Order,
2434000	2438000	the side that always wins out is
2438000	2442000	always left-leaning. It's always the
2442000	2446000	sort of bog-standard Democrat position because
2446000	2450000	it's set in New York.
2450000	2454000	But the show is still good in spite of
2454000	2458000	that because it's well-written.
2458000	2462000	It just seems to be rare nowadays to have things that are well-written.
2462000	2466000	It doesn't exist anymore.
2466000	2470000	In any case... I think
2470000	2474000	all the creative talent of the 21st century was just
2474000	2478000	poured into the Lord of the Rings movies and now we're having to say it through
2478000	2482000	a 100-year darkness of no talent just
2482000	2486000	because it was all went into those movies.
2486000	2490000	Are you eating something? I kind of hear. Are you chowing down?
2490000	2494000	Not really. Oh, are you drinking? Do you have a slurp for us?
2494000	2498000	Yeah, I'm chugging.
2498000	2502000	Okay, that's what it is.
2502000	2506000	This is coming out if you're interested.
2506000	2510000	I keep bothering Arch and Sargon to say, listen, we have to play a game
2510000	2514000	of Thirsty Sword Lesbians. We have to play a game of this shit.
2514000	2518000	It would be fucking hilarious. See, here's the thing though. Arch would
2518000	2522000	probably go for it. Sargon, I know he's busy these days, but I think
2522000	2526000	if Sargon got a spare five minutes, I'm sure he'd be down for it.
2526000	2530000	Actually, Arch is the one who said no, he did not want to play
2530000	2534000	Thirsty Sword Lesbians.
2534000	2538000	Well, to be fair, he's very serious about his tabletop.
2538000	2542000	Right, right. Okay, let's go on to the next thing I've got here.
2542000	2546000	Andrew Garfield talks Spiderman.
2546000	2550000	Money is the thing that has corrupted all of us and led to the terrible
2550000	2554000	ecological collapse that we are all about to die under.
2554000	2558000	Shut the fuck up, Spiderman. How is this about Spiderman?
2558000	2562000	Like,
2562000	2566000	I didn't realize Spiderman was a socialist.
2566000	2570000	An eco-socialist at that.
2570000	2574000	I just don't understand. He's asked about
2574000	2578000	his newest, because he's in the newest Spiderman movie.
2578000	2582000	Hey, Mr. Andrew Garfield, how do you feel about your new Spiderman movie?
2582000	2586000	And this is what he gives us as an answer. What the fuck?
2586000	2590000	They almost feel like automatons at this point.
2590000	2594000	No matter what question you give them, it has to relate to
2594000	2598000	to woke talking points.
2598000	2602000	And to the point where it's so ingrained in their head that they just can't deviate from it anymore.
2602000	2606000	I don't know.
2606000	2610000	I almost feel sorry for them for how NPC they have become.
2610000	2614000	Let's see what he actually said. Oh, this is why he spoke to the
2614000	2618000	Guardian. Okay. So speaking to the Guardian, Andrew Garfield briefly
2618000	2622000	touched upon his time playing Peter Parker
2622000	2626000	in Sony's second cinematic take on the Marvel character for The Amazing Spider-Man
2626000	2630000	and its sequel. Relieved to not have to dance around being asked whether or not he'd be back for the
2630000	2634000	third reboot at the studio, Garfield seemingly relished in the frank honesty
2634000	2638000	of what it was like to be catapulted into a character as monumental
2638000	2642000	as Peter Parker.
2652000	2656000	There were millions of dollars at stake and that's what guides the ship. It was a big awakening
2656000	2660000	and it hurt.
2660000	2664000	So he's whinging about that movies cost money
2664000	2668000	and they are expected to do well. And that he got
2668000	2672000	paid.
2672000	2676000	Grow the fuck up you man child. He says
2676000	2680000	Comic-Con in San Diego is full of grown men and women still
2680000	2684000	in touch with that pure thing the character meant to them. But you add
2684000	2688000	in market forces and test groups and suddenly the focus is less
2688000	2692000	on the soul of it and more on ensuring we make as much money as possible.
2692000	2696000	And I find that heartbreaking
2696000	2700000	in all matters of culture. Money is the thing that has corrupted all of us
2700000	2704000	and led to the terrible ecological collapse that we are all about to die
2704000	2708000	under. It's like holy fuck. Dude, I think you'll be fine living in Hollywood.
2708000	2712000	Actually no, that's probably going to go underwater. But you'll have enough money to leave. Don't worry about it.
2712000	2716000	This almost sounds like, I don't know
2716000	2720000	it almost sounds like he's a child who
2720000	2724000	watched Spider-Man, thought Spider-Man was real but then
2724000	2728000	went to watch the movie being filmed and realised it's all fake.
2728000	2732000	Yes. Now he has a point. There's definitely
2732000	2736000	been a trend of just soulless cash-ins
2736000	2740000	on behalf of Disney and Marvel and Star Wars.
2740000	2744000	You know, there's been some really shitty movies that are clearly just there
2744000	2748000	to swindle fans and run away. That happens.
2748000	2752000	Don't get me wrong, those exist and in fact a large
2752000	2756000	proportion of the comic-skate
2756000	2760000	or whatever is whinging. I say whinging. That's being a bit unfair.
2760000	2764000	But it's complaining about that.
2764000	2768000	Yeah, but he then links it to the terrible ecological
2768000	2772000	collapse that we're all about to die under.
2772000	2776000	Man. Okay Lefty Doomer.
2776000	2780000	Yeah, like, again, just like the vaccine
2780000	2784000	conversation earlier. I'm not going to be one of those people who is like climate change doesn't exist.
2784000	2788000	It does exist. But like, I think it'll be fine, dude.
2788000	2792000	You know, I think human ingenuity will
2792000	2796000	invent some cool new thing that will solve whatever problems that we have
2796000	2800000	and it'll be okay. We are not going to, like, the planet's
2800000	2804000	not going to turn into a bowl of molten lava. It'll be okay, guys.
2804000	2808000	Like, stop thinking like you're going to be living in fucking fallout.
2808000	2812000	It's fine. We're not going down that road.
2812000	2816000	The two big problems with climate change are cutting down trees
2816000	2820000	and plastic in the ocean. Those are the two big ones. Yes.
2820000	2824000	Now, plastic in the ocean is already being solved
2824000	2828000	by market forces as we speak. There are already been technologies
2828000	2832000	developed to eat, like, micro technologies being developed to eat plastic.
2832000	2836000	And second of all,
2836000	2840000	the trees, we've had methods of sustainable
2840000	2844000	tree growth since the Roman Empire.
2844000	2848000	Like, this isn't new information.
2848000	2852000	It's not some big revelation on how to cut
2852000	2856000	down trees without killing them. The problem
2856000	2860000	is that China and Russia, and to a lesser extent India, don't care.
2860000	2864000	And when you have those three, like, America and Canada and the UK
2864000	2868000	and Europe can do whatever it wants, but if you have
2868000	2872000	those guys not giving a shit, you're not going to solve the problem. You can't point
2872000	2876000	the fingers at us.
2876000	2880000	Well, ultimately, India
2880000	2884000	I think it's just a case of they're still in their industrialization phase.
2884000	2888000	So, they will come round over time.
2888000	2892000	Russia will need a regime change, but I think that's something that will occur naturally
2892000	2896000	because they're not a totalitarian regime.
2896000	2900000	They're more of an oligarchy. Authoritarian, certainly, but not totalitarian.
2900000	2904000	And China
2904000	2908000	I don't think China will last the next 50 years.
2908000	2912000	Yeah, China will destroy itself at this rate. Everyone's like, China, you gotta confront China. Well, yeah,
2912000	2916000	we do gotta confront China, but also, China's already on a downhill path
2916000	2920000	of its own making, you know?
2920000	2924000	Whenever someone says, oh, a country's gonna take over
2924000	2928000	America as the next big,
2928000	2932000	the next number one economy, there always seems to be
2932000	2936000	some underlying thing that people are ignoring.
2936000	2940000	Like, with Japan, it was the fact that
2940000	2944000	Japan, it was the fact that
2944000	2948000	in order to fuel their economic prosperity in the 80s, they were taking on huge
2948000	2952000	amounts of death.
2952000	2956000	And in China, it's the fact that their entire
2956000	2960000	economy is based on being the factory of the world, and if that
2960000	2964000	gets taken away, they'll just collapse under their own weight.
2964000	2968000	Right.
2968000	2972000	I guess it's time to go onto the next article, because I don't think there's anything more worthwhile than this.
2972000	2976000	It's long, and it's really fucking stupid.
2976000	2980000	So it's just him whinging? Okay, fair enough.
2980000	2984000	I forget what this one is. What is this? Oh, yeah. Check this out.
2984000	2988000	This is on a subreddit about trans pets.
2988000	2992000	Okay. My male dog doesn't
2992000	2996000	lift his leg to pee. Is he trans?
2996000	3000000	My dog has already hit the two years of age mark and still pee is like a
3000000	3004000	female or a pup. Should I make an appointment with a trans-friendly
3004000	3008000	vet for gender reassignment?
3008000	3012000	Right. Let me make one
3012000	3016000	thing abundantly clear.
3016000	3020000	You cannot have a trans dog.
3020000	3024000	Trans is a very specific, being trans
3024000	3028000	is caused by a very specific mental state that is exclusive, as far as we know,
3028000	3032000	to humans.
3032000	3036000	Hold on. You cannot have a trans dog.
3036000	3040000	Okay, you're gonna like this one. Yeah, this is r slash
3040000	3044000	trans pets. Oh, just kill me. Kill me.
3044000	3048000	How to stop my cat from being aggressive while
3048000	3052000	dilating. So my cat
3052000	3056000	Julie had her gender reassignment surgery three
3056000	3060000	days ago. The surgeon said that her neo-vagina
3060000	3064000	needs to be dilated three times a day, ten minutes each.
3064000	3068000	But she isn't liking it. How can I help her? My
3068000	3072000	hands are full of wounds because of her claws and teeth. I wanted to get
3072000	3076000	her declawed, but claws or nails are an essential part of
3076000	3080000	being a woman or a female cat. So
3080000	3084000	So you've cut a male cat's bollocks off
3084000	3088000	and now you're pouring fucking fluids onto its wound
3088000	3092000	and you're expecting it not to hurt?
3092000	3096000	It's not just that. The surgeon built a cat
3096000	3100000	neo-vagina that needs to be dilated with like
3100000	3104000	what do they use? It's kind of like a
3104000	3108000	it's like a rod that holds the wound open.
3108000	3112000	Yeah, I know, but what I'm saying is that something tells me
3112000	3116000	that this is not a veterinarian's association
3116000	3120000	approved. Probably not. So it's very
3120000	3124000	likely that that wound really fucking hurts for that cat.
3124000	3128000	Yes. I'm hoping this is like a troll sub.
3128000	3132000	Like holy fuck. No, I see, I
3132000	3136000	really hope as well because as funny as it is, at the same time
3136000	3140000	this boils my piss because I really hate, like
3140000	3144000	needless to say I hate animal abuse, but I really hate animal abuse.
3144000	3148000	Yeah, this is ridiculous.
3148000	3152000	Okay, this one. Alright.
3152000	3156000	Are you guys ready for the latest TikTok dance?
3156000	3160000	You're not going to be able to hear it, okay?
3160000	3164000	So I'll post it in the chat.
3164000	3168000	Here it is. And you can pull it up yourself.
3168000	3172000	And then on three we'll play it, okay?
3172000	3176000	Okay. One, two, three.
3176000	3180000	I'm dreaming
3180000	3184000	of a mass Christmas
3184000	3188000	Pick that shit up over your nose
3188000	3192000	You can't even sing!
3192000	3196000	Where the anti-masker is all set And there's
3196000	3200000	a political division
3200000	3204000	To get our Covid count so low
3204000	3208000	Oh to know
3208000	3212000	I'm dreaming of a mass Christmas
3212000	3216000	Pick that shit up over your nose
3216000	3220000	I'm dreaming of a mass Christmas
3220000	3224000	Don't wanna see no chin diapers in here
3224000	3228000	Seriously, on the mouth and the nose. Or get out!
3228000	3232000	Come on! It's not that hard.
3232000	3236000	That's it.
3236000	3240000	Oh god. I would like to say a couple of things.
3240000	3244000	Oh okay. Sorry.
3244000	3248000	Which is good because it wouldn't play on my end.
3248000	3252000	Second of all, that's ruined
3252000	3256000	my day. Thank you.
3256000	3260000	I love Christmas and that has
3260000	3264000	thoroughly corrupted the image of Christmas.
3264000	3268000	I am proud to say I have only worn a mask
3268000	3272000	once and I found it reasonable when I did because I was going into a hospital.
3272000	3276000	And it's like okay yeah fair enough you know. Honestly we probably should have been doing that before
3276000	3280000	the pandemic anyway. It's a hospital. It's a different situation. But I don't
3280000	3284000	wear them to go to stores or anything. I certainly don't wear them just walking inside my house.
3284000	3288000	Fuck that. Fuck all the Covid theatre.
3288000	3292000	Fuck it. I have never.
3292000	3296000	Right. It is a legal requirement in our country to wear them on the bus.
3296000	3300000	Which is only recent. That only came in a couple of weeks ago.
3300000	3304000	It is
3304000	3308000	technically legal to wear it. It is technically.
3308000	3312000	You do technically have to wear it in certain venues but nobody enforces it.
3312000	3316000	Because people are sick to death.
3316000	3320000	And
3320000	3324000	I only wear it at work because it's a legal part
3324000	3328000	of my requirement at work because I work
3328000	3332000	in an industry tangentially related to the NHS.
3332000	3336000	See here it kind of exists in a grey area
3336000	3340000	because it makes sense to me that if a store owner wants you
3340000	3344000	to wear a mask in their shop they can tell you to leave if you don't. It's their property. It's their right.
3344000	3348000	It's their business. It's their house. You got to do what they say. Fair enough.
3348000	3352000	But like the government will not arrest
3352000	3356000	you if you don't wear a mask in a store. But they
3356000	3360000	sometimes find the store for not telling you to do so.
3360000	3364000	But the store is not empowered to make you do so.
3364000	3368000	It's like no one wants to actually be holding the potato.
3368000	3372000	The hot potato responsibility on this. So they've left it as
3372000	3376000	vague as possible. You know what I mean?
3376000	3380000	Mitch for $2.65. Thank you very much.
3380000	3384000	Physically remove those mask speakers and animal
3384000	3388000	trunes so to speak.
3388000	3392000	Hopper posting in my
3392000	3396000	fucking chat.
3396000	3400000	We're not going to read these articles but I just wanted to go over the juxtaposition here.
3400000	3404000	They're both from the same thing. They're both from Yahoo. You got
3404000	3408000	Joe Rogan who's not a doctor gives terrible vaccine
3408000	3412000	advice. There's the headline.
3412000	3416000	Oops I accidentally clicked off of it like an idiot. Okay. Joe Rogan who's not
3416000	3420000	a doctor gives terrible vaccine advice. Podcaster Joe Rogan who has no public health
3420000	3424000	expertise told his listeners that
3424000	3428000	healthy young adults have no need to get a vaccine.
3428000	3432000	That's probably kind of true. However, the headline
3432000	3436000	and the way that they're framing this is like
3436000	3440000	they had to put in who's not a doctor. Okay. So also from Yahoo
3440000	3444000	you have five things Bill Gates wants you to
3444000	3448000	know about COVID-19 variants. Couldn't you say
3448000	3452000	five things Bill Gates who's not a doctor? Like there's
3452000	3456000	obvious bias here. Here's the thing.
3456000	3460000	Joe Rogan is a podcaster. Bill Gates is their lord and master.
3460000	3464000	He is one of the
3464000	3468000	leaders in what the certain right British right wing
3468000	3472000	YouTube circles would call the managerial elite.
3472000	3476000	Yes. So have you seen that picture of Bill Gates drinking shit water?
3476000	3480000	No. Okay. So a few years ago
3480000	3484000	Bill Gates was heavily promoting a machine that turned shit into
3484000	3488000	drinkable water and the water looked completely fine.
3488000	3492000	It was probably like when it comes down to the actual molecules involved, it probably was
3492000	3496000	just regular water, but he takes it and he takes a big swig of it and he's like, that's delicious.
3496000	3500000	And it's like, holy fuck dude.
3500000	3504000	It's like at best it's water. It's not delicious. It's just
3504000	3508000	water. Yes. At worst, at worst you're actively trying
3508000	3512000	to deceive people into drinking shit tasting water.
3512000	3516000	Yep. Okay. What is this?
3516000	3520000	Oh God, this is from UndeadScribe. What did Poe send me
3520000	3524000	today? Oh yeah, this. Okay. This is a
3524000	3528000	trans person who's Japanese. Does anyone want my own
3528000	3532000	egg wine? It's about 100 milliliters.
3532000	3536000	Only wine, but not the eggs. Okay. This person cut off
3536000	3540000	their own testicles and then fermented
3540000	3544000	those testicles and made wine out of it.
3544000	3548000	Oh.
3548000	3552000	Look, I'm all for trans
3552000	3556000	rights, right? Oh, I know. I know how much you're into them, buddy.
3556000	3560000	I'm all for trans rights, but at the same time, can some
3560000	3564000	of you just stop being such fucking degenerates, please?
3564000	3568000	Like, can you just, like, I feel like the mother
3568000	3572000	in the car in the Babadook. Just, why can't you just be
3572000	3576000	normal?
3576000	3580000	Oh God, like you got like women who like cook with their period
3580000	3584000	blood or they like, they make like vagina yeast bread
3584000	3588000	or whatever the fuck. It all like, why the fuck are people doing this?
3588000	3592000	Why? Because they're not okay.
3592000	3596000	Like gender dysphoria is the least of their worries.
3596000	3600000	Man, and you know what, like this is not
3600000	3604000	a phenomenon. It's like, it's not exclusive
3604000	3608000	to these types of people. Now we've seen a lot of it from these types of people in the past,
3608000	3612000	in the past decade or so, but I recall when I was growing up hearing
3612000	3616000	about, and this is out of more traditional communities, about
3616000	3620000	women who would eat placentas and I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
3620000	3624000	Who? Why? Who the fuck wants to eat a childbirth placenta?
3624000	3628000	And it's like, well, it's just, it's like a natural thing, dude. It's like, shut the fuck up.
3628000	3632000	I don't want to, I don't want to do any of this.
3632000	3636000	It all just sounds awful.
3636000	3640000	Oh, hold on a second. I think my headphones just died. Uh oh.
3640000	3644000	Hey, are you still there?
3644000	3648000	Yeah, I'm still here.
3648000	3652000	Okay, they came back. I can hear you. Great. Alright.
3652000	3656000	When recycling goes wrong. Oh, okay. Hold on.
3656000	3660000	In the chat, Millie, the weekly sip is a lot better without the Minecraft server BS.
3660000	3664000	I advertise the server at the start of the sip for like 30 seconds.
3664000	3668000	Does that bother you that much? Alright.
3668000	3672000	Okay. Minecraften. Yes.
3672000	3676000	Only surveillance can save us from the coronavirus.
3676000	3680000	You must have seen this, this headline around, right?
3680000	3684000	Big data. Oh, yes.
3684000	3688000	Look, here's, here's all I'm going to say.
3688000	3692000	Anyone who supports this, if the revolution
3692000	3696000	does end up happening, if the boogaloo comes along,
3696000	3700000	I will not mourn your death.
3700000	3704000	Okay, so.
3704000	3708000	Only surveillance can save us from coronavirus. Big data
3708000	3712000	offers tools to stop the pandemic right now if we change our definition
3712000	3716000	of privacy. Look at this, look at this
3716000	3720000	fucking guy's phone. What is this, 16 different
3720000	3724000	COVID apps? One of them is called coronavirus sus.
3728000	3732000	Fuck. Okay. In those parts of the world
3732000	3736000	under lockdown, people have discovered a renewed appreciation for the internet
3736000	3740000	and the resources it offers. Books, movies, music, endless
3740000	3744000	news content, and the tools to communicate with friends and family.
3744000	3748000	Imagine the lockdown without the internet. It's not a comforting thought, but that would just be like
3748000	3752000	renting games from, you know, the local Blockbuster or whatever and just
3752000	3756000	staying inside. So.
3756000	3760000	To be honest, that's, that's, that's making me a tad nostalgic. I could go for that right now.
3760000	3764000	Yeah. Fucking. Yeah. Fucking get, get some
3764000	3768000	pizza, some ice cream, play some GameCube or something.
3768000	3772000	Oh, it takes me back. To be fair, it was N64 for me. I'm a little
3772000	3776000	bit older. N64 was my big rental time.
3776000	3780000	My, um, I rented a lot when I was young because by the time I got to my teenage
3780000	3784000	years, Blockbuster had largely died out. Yep. But
3784000	3788000	it was GameCube for me because again, I was a bit younger
3788000	3792000	than when you rented, but also I didn't really have a choice
3792000	3796000	because renting would largely died out by the early 2010s.
3796000	3800000	This is a shame, man, because now, now you just got to pay like
3800000	3804000	fucking $90 in Canadian money to get a new game. Fuck.
3804000	3808000	Here's the thing. It's also the fact that
3808000	3812000	like, not to get us too far off topic, but also like
3812000	3816000	it's the fact that it's largely been replaced by stuff like Xbox Game Pass
3816000	3820000	and yeah, Game Pass is, Game Pass is worth it on the face of it
3820000	3824000	but also at the same time it's like renting
3824000	3828000	like renting was good because it was specific. You could go
3828000	3832000	and rent the specific game that you wanted. You weren't just
3832000	3836000	getting like, paying a monthly fee to like get like a
3836000	3840000	different selection of games filtered in and out every month. Yep.
3840000	3844000	It's a possibility that none of them interest you.
3844000	3848000	Yeah, when I was growing up it was $3 a night.
3848000	3852000	So you get a game, you have it for a full 24 hour period. Cost 3 bucks.
3852000	3856000	6 bucks if you go for the whole weekend.
3856000	3860000	Stay up all night, eat some sweets, eat some pizza,
3860000	3864000	complete the game overnight, take it back the next day.
3864000	3868000	Yep. Yep. Alright, so
3868000	3872000	let's go through here.
3872000	3876000	The internet's system of surveillance has been perfected beyond
3876000	3880000	our imaginations and usually beyond our acknowledgement. It now extends
3880000	3884000	over email, social media, credit card payments, cell phone use, and
3884000	3888000	travel records. Every flight and hotel booking, every payment and bank
3888000	3892000	transfer, every call, every picture can be brought together in a single
3892000	3896000	platform and mined for interesting or unusual patterns.
3896000	3900000	Yet, while extending in every direction and the system was completely
3900000	3904000	powerless to warn us about the coronavirus, let's fight it. That is about to change
3904000	3908000	and our concept of personal privacy will have to change with it.
3908000	3912000	That sounds fucking awful and fuck you.
3912000	3916000	No, it's not happening. I will
3916000	3920000	throw away my phone and I will
3920000	3924000	throw away my phone and I will give up technology before I allow
3924000	3928000	the state to track me using my
3928000	3932000	devices. I will go offline before
3932000	3936000	that happens. I have a Galaxy S2.
3936000	3940000	Any of you remember that phone? The Galaxy S2?
3940000	3944000	What is it? 2010? Yeah.
3944000	3948000	And the reason I haven't just mindlessly updated is because
3948000	3952000	it still works. I don't use data or anything
3952000	3956000	when I'm out. Here's what I use my phone for. I occasionally call my parents
3956000	3960000	and I occasionally text some people and that's it. I never use data.
3960000	3964000	I never really use its other features. Oh yeah, I have like
3964000	3968000	an exercise app on it that I only occasionally use because I'm fat. But the point is
3968000	3972000	I don't need a super powerful phone.
3972000	3976000	And also, I'm not even sure if my phone would work with a coronavirus
3976000	3980000	scanning app that's currently being enforced in Ontario.
3980000	3984000	So, like, my
3984000	3988000	Facebook, I have one picture on my Facebook because they require
3988000	3992000	you to have an avatar. And the picture is of Dr. Robotnik's
3992000	3996000	face. And it's been the same picture since 2008.
3996000	4000000	Like, I work on the internet.
4000000	4004000	I have the YouTube channel and I stream on Twitch and all this stuff.
4004000	4008000	But when it comes to me personally, I live a very low tech life.
4008000	4012000	And I kind of prefer it that way. I kind of prefer it that way.
4012000	4016000	Short-Fighter Taku is very tech-savvy, but
4016000	4020000	Devin, he's not
4020000	4024000	He is a good,
4024000	4028000	Mormon boy. Not Mormon, Amish boy.
4028000	4032000	He's a good Amish boy.
4032000	4036000	He is a good Amish boy and he does no wrong. It's funny because
4036000	4040000	like, I'd say most of the time I go out
4040000	4044000	of the house without my phone. Like, if I want to listen to music, sometimes I'll bring it. But I also
4044000	4048000	have like an old MP3 player from like 2006. It still works. So it's like, whatever. I don't care.
4048000	4052000	But the point being is that
4052000	4056000	my parents who are boomers, they're, they're older than me.
4056000	4060000	They, they chastise me every time I
4060000	4064000	leave the house without my phone, because sometimes they'll call me. I'm not there. Like, where were you?
4064000	4068000	Oh, I didn't have my phone when I went out. Like, why don't you have your phone with you when you go out? And it's like, well
4068000	4072000	fucking, you spent most of your life without doing that shit.
4072000	4076000	Why does it matter now?
4076000	4080000	I never needed it. Yes. I hardly ever need it. Like fucking leave me alone.
4080000	4084000	Yeah. And I, I, I like
4084000	4088000	the occasional feeling of, because I live like 10 minutes away from a forest,
4088000	4092000	I like the occasional feeling of just going into the woods and being disconnected from everybody else
4092000	4096000	and just kind of having an hour or two to myself, you know,
4096000	4100000	Naomi and I will go for a walk, you know, it just no, no,
4100000	4104000	no connections. You don't need to be connected or jacked in all the fucking time.
4104000	4108000	Oh, I know that feeling. I grew up in an area of the
4108000	4112000	South of England called the New Forest in Hampshire and
4112000	4116000	literally having the forest on your doorstep, it's such a blessing.
4116000	4120000	It really is. People don't understand how big and how wild Canada
4120000	4124000	truly is. Like there is, unless you're in like
4124000	4128000	Vancouver or Halifax or Montreal or Toronto or Ottawa,
4128000	4132000	if you're anywhere else or Calgary. Yeah. If you're anywhere else
4132000	4136000	you are an hour's worth of forest
4136000	4140000	away from anything else outside of your town. It is, this is a
4140000	4144000	wild, isolated country. There's just tons of mountains, tons
4144000	4148000	of forests, tons of rivers and lakes. Like there is no,
4148000	4152000	there is no, most Canadians live in a
4152000	4156000	place where they can just go off the grid in about 15 minutes. It's quite nice.
4156000	4160000	Before, um, before the 20th
4160000	4164000	century fricking Canada was basically just IRL Skyrim.
4164000	4168000	Yeah, pretty much. There's like nobody fucking here, man. Like,
4168000	4172000	okay. People talk about native civilizations and, you know, they
4172000	4176000	weren't as primitive as people said, especially if you get down to like Central America, they
4176000	4180000	had like empires and they had feudal systems and stuff. So it's okay. Fair enough. But like
4180000	4184000	the natives that lived here before Europeans showed up, they
4184000	4188000	like they, they, they only barely existed
4188000	4192000	because it was so fucking hard to live here. It was so cold.
4192000	4196000	So even, even now that that's reflected, like if you're
4196000	4200000	outside of a big city, like there, there's, there's some truly
4200000	4204000	off the grid areas here. It's, it's, it's actually nice. It's quite nice.
4204000	4208000	Indeed. So yeah, we can move on
4208000	4212000	because like this is just a bunch of stuff. Oh, oh, we want
4212000	4216000	to pay for your bullshit. Fuck you. Right. Before we do that,
4216000	4220000	I'm going to read some super chats. Oh, okay. Um, because
4220000	4224000	because we've got quite a few while we're talking. Oh shit. I don't
4224000	4228000	want, I don't want people to feel neglected.
4228000	4232000	Um, uh, $1 from Mitch, just saying trune
4232000	4236000	and
4236000	4240000	and Mr. Personality for $14.88. Don't think
4240000	4244000	I don't know what you're doing when you write that. Um, cannibalism
4244000	4248000	with extra steps. I'm not sure what that's in context
4248000	4252000	too, but okay. Neither do I. What did we talk about
4252000	4256000	previously? Oh, the, uh, the testicle wine.
4256000	4260000	Oh, right. Okay. Yeah. Pretty much. Listen, listen, would you drink
4260000	4264000	the testicle wine? Um, how much
4264000	4268000	would you be willing to pay me to do it? What if it was from a hot trap?
4268000	4272000	Still, how much would you pay?
4272000	4276000	The hotness, the hotness of the trap is irrelevant.
4276000	4280000	It's still bollocks in it. It's still fermented bollocks.
4280000	4284000	Oh, wait, hold on. Does, does bollocks mean
4284000	4288000	mean balls? Yeah. Oh, I always thought it meant
4288000	4292000	thought it meant ass cheeks. No, it's why you get, it's getting kicked
4292000	4296000	in the bollocks. It means getting kicked in the balls. Oh, okay. No, no.
4296000	4300000	See, I don't really know British slang. I always thought it meant your butt. No,
4300000	4304000	it's, it's, it's your, it's your balls. Oh, okay. All right.
4304000	4308000	It's like the, how hot the trap is, is
4308000	4312000	immaterial to the fact that it's still fermented bollocks.
4316000	4320000	Right. Shall we move on? There's a guy in the chat who said he's
4320000	4324000	from Thunder Bay. I went, I went to school in Thunder Bay. I went to university there.
4324000	4328000	What a, what a fucking isolated, oh my
4328000	4332000	God, what an isolated shithole Thunder Bay is. Okay. Thunder Bay
4332000	4336000	is a reasonably big city and it's surrounded by like six
4336000	4340000	hours of forest in all directions. There's nothing there.
4340000	4344000	It's just wild wilderness. It's man. And also
4344000	4348000	Is this why, is this why when you and your friend, when you and Dave, I was about to say
4348000	4352000	your friend, I don't know his name.
4352000	4356000	Is this why you and Dave, whenever you talk about your hometown,
4356000	4360000	you talk about it like it's like some middle, like some like
4360000	4364000	middle America buttfuck nowhere town because it actually is. It actually
4364000	4368000	is. Yes. And also, unfortunately, it's been overrun by
4368000	4372000	heroin since we moved away. It is not the idyllic place it was when we grew up.
4372000	4376000	It's a shame.
4376000	4380000	Is that because of like deindustrialization?
4380000	4384000	Actually, no, because the towns, it's one of those single industry
4384000	4388000	towns, but that industry hasn't died. It's forestry. Like there's no mines to be shut down.
4388000	4392000	There's no factories to be shut down. It's a paper mill.
4392000	4396000	And so that, it's been going now and it's probably going to keep going for a long time
4396000	4400000	because Canada has tons of trees. But no, it's just
4400000	4404000	that like a lot of people who
4404000	4408000	couldn't leave and couldn't get jobs at the mill because it's really the only place
4408000	4412000	you can work in the town, they just ended up getting on drugs because they couldn't, they didn't
4412000	4416000	have anything else.
4416000	4420000	Is it a case of like
4420000	4424000	a scarcity of like jobs in the town? Yes, yeah.
4424000	4428000	All right. Yeah. And yeah, you can walk out into the forest in the summer
4428000	4432000	and just find random junkies living in the woods.
4432000	4436000	Oh. Yes, I went to Lakehead University. I went to Lakehead University.
4436000	4440000	I got, you know what? I got my minor in gender studies
4440000	4444000	at Lakehead University. Yeah, you've mentioned that on the stream
4444000	4448000	before. That's how I know about a lot of this shit. I still have
4448000	4452000	my old textbooks. Okay, so I have like 40
4452000	4456000	minutes, right? We should probably get through these articles. Yeah. All right, what's this?
4456000	4460000	Blaine police investigating after Instacart
4460000	4464000	shopper allegedly drives over an elderly couple's groceries.
4464000	4468000	Jesus.
4468000	4472000	Why would you do that?
4472000	4476000	Why would you drive over, like if you, if you work for Instacart and you buy an elderly
4476000	4480000	couple's groceries, why would you drive over it after, let's
4480000	4484000	see. An Instacart shopper drove over their groceries last week
4484000	4488000	possibly in response to a pro law enforcement sign
4488000	4492000	in their front yard. Oh, so they had like a
4492000	4496000	like a blue lives matter, like a thin blue line kind of sign in their front yard. So this person
4496000	4500000	delivers their groceries and destroys them. Wow. Okay.
4500000	4504000	Yeah.
4504000	4508000	It's just like, oh yeah, that's totally a way, like it's not
4508000	4512000	even necessarily, it's not even necessarily about conducting yourself or having a
4512000	4516000	anti-cop opinion that winds me up. It's just like, this is only going to be detrimental
4516000	4520000	to you in the long run. Like yeah, you destroyed their groceries so they can buy you.
4520000	4524000	They can buy you more. Is it worth really losing your job over?
4524000	4528000	Yeah, so according to a news
4528000	4532000	release, the couple had placed an order for delivery on the morning of December 6th.
4532000	4536000	Once the driver arrived at their home,
4536000	4540000	the couple went outside to meet the driver. The driver yelled from the check the inside of
4540000	4544000	their Christmas wreath where they found a receipt with a derogatory message written on it.
4544000	4548000	It says that Instacart doesn't pay their employees, find another
4548000	4552000	slave, fuck the police, racist pigs,
4552000	4556000	and the groceries themselves were destroyed
4556000	4560000	and left in the driveway. Oh my god.
4560000	4564000	Wow. Wait, so this wasn't even because
4564000	4568000	of them? No, it was, it's just that
4568000	4572000	this person who works for Instacart just didn't care.
4572000	4576000	They feel like they're not getting paid enough and they saw the
4576000	4580000	thin blue line sign in their front yard, so they destroyed the groceries
4580000	4584000	and wrote on their Christmas wreath. And they wrote
4584000	4588000	find another slave, fuck the police, racist pigs, and it's like Jesus.
4588000	4592000	Oh my god.
4592000	4596000	Wow. So they've
4596000	4600000	identified the worker, a 36 year old from Coon Rapids,
4600000	4604000	and that charges are in the near future. She is not cooperating with us, if you can
4604000	4608000	believe that. They're going to add disorderly conduct charges
4608000	4612000	and criminal damage to property. And a GoFundMe
4612000	4616000	has been raising $7,000 for the old couple, so that's nice.
4616000	4620000	Oh, that's nice. I like that.
4620000	4624000	You know what? This is actually missing a part of the story. This is a different article than the one that
4624000	4628000	I had planned to show, so just give me a second. Give me just a moment, okay?
4632000	4636000	Listen to those taps.
4636000	4640000	Those clickety-clacks. Here it is. Alright.
4640000	4644000	Found it. Because part
4644000	4648000	of the article was supposed to talk about who
4648000	4652000	the person was, who this 36 year old driver was for Instacart.
4652000	4656000	But it wasn't in there. So I just quickly found it. And here's what it is.
4656000	4660000	If you can see it. Milliwig in chat is asking what's
4660000	4664000	Instacart before we move on. Instacart is a, do you know what Instacart is?
4664000	4668000	No. Oh really? Okay. So Instacart is a company
4668000	4672000	that you, there's an app and you
4672000	4676000	put in your grocery list on the app. And they have workers who
4676000	4680000	will go out to a store and buy the food
4680000	4684000	and then deliver it to you. And then they charge you for the delivery and they charge you for the food.
4684000	4688000	So the idea is if you can't leave your house but you have to go grocery shopping
4688000	4692000	you can get an Instacart order.
4692000	4696000	Oh no, a lot. We don't have anything like that mainly because
4696000	4700000	oh we do actually have something like that. It's called Ocado.
4700000	4704000	And we
4704000	4708000	mostly don't have any competitors to Ocado
4708000	4712000	mainly because most grocery stores
4712000	4716000	have their own delivery services. Right. Direct to your door.
4716000	4720000	That's not common here. So apps have kind of filled the void. And we also have
4720000	4724000	similar ones for food delivery like Grubhub and stuff like that. Where if you want to have food
4724000	4728000	from a restaurant that doesn't deliver delivered to you, you can go to
4728000	4732000	there's SkipTheDishes, I think that's Canadian only, there's Grubhub
4732000	4736000	and what's the other one? Shit. Uber Eats is one of them.
4736000	4740000	There's one more at least. We have Uber Eats and Just Eat.
4740000	4744000	Those are the two big ones here. Right. Right. Okay. So Instacart
4744000	4748000	is just a grocery delivery service basically. But here we go. Find another slave
4748000	4752000	fuck, find another slave racist, fuck the police pigs
4752000	4756000	and here's the person.
4756000	4760000	This individual with purple hair named Tara. How very
4760000	4764000	surprising. Yeah.
4764000	4768000	I wonder if she might have a political slant.
4768000	4772000	There might be a reason why she destroyed this elderly couple's groceries.
4772000	4776000	Possibly tell. In any case, she's
4776000	4780000	facing a 90 day jail sentence in fines.
4780000	4784000	Good fucker. I'm good fuck. Yep.
4784000	4788000	Okay. So what's this? Oh, check this out. You're going to like this.
4788000	4792000	Okay. Listen, listen, listen to this, okay?
4792000	4796000	A 10 year old boy steals parent's car to visit his grandparents
4796000	4800000	who are 68 miles away. And then he tells the
4800000	4804000	police he's a dwarf who has forgotten his license.
4804000	4808000	Absolute madman. He drove his parent's car into a
4808000	4812000	snowy ditch and he said that he was a dwarf. He just forgot his license.
4812000	4816000	He drove more than 10 kilometers for veering
4816000	4820000	off the road where he was found by a snow plow driver who alerted the police.
4820000	4824000	The parents had woke up, discovered that their children was missing
4824000	4828000	and somebody had taken off with their car. They were pretty upset. The boy told the snow plow
4828000	4832000	driver that he was a dwarf and he had forgotten his driver's license at home.
4832000	4836000	And it turns out the child wasn't injured and the car wasn't damaged and they decided not
4836000	4840000	to file charges. Um, so I
4840000	4844000	guess that's a good end, but wow.
4844000	4848000	Here's the thing though, getting 10 kilometers away with no driving
4848000	4852000	experience at 10 years old, that's pretty impressive.
4852000	4856000	Yeah. Is this in Canada?
4856000	4860000	No, this is in Norway. Oh, Norway.
4860000	4864000	I was just going to say, Canada, Norway, it's still like icy as fuck.
4864000	4868000	That's even more impressive.
4868000	4872000	Imagine having the balls to say, oh yeah, I'm just a dwarf.
4872000	4876000	Did he pass the speech check? No, I don't think he did.
4876000	4880000	I do not think he did.
4880000	4884000	Go ahead, go ahead.
4884000	4888000	I was going to say he had a 70, he needed a 75 for the speech check.
4888000	4892000	This one is actually a much more serious one.
4892000	4896000	Jesus. That fucking, that headline is like a roller coaster.
4896000	4900000	Holy shit.
4900000	4904000	One, I obviously, I don't feel bad for the
4904000	4908000	boyfriend cause the boyfriend's clearly got anger issues.
4908000	4912000	If that's, if he blew up that badly, um,
4912000	4916000	I don't think he did.
4916000	4920000	I don't think he did.
4920000	4924000	Um, yeah, discovering your wife's having an affair
4924000	4928000	is horrible, but still, um,
4928000	4932000	furthermore, like,
4932000	4936000	I don't really feel sympathy for her too much because she's a nonce.
4936000	4940000	Um,
4940000	4944000	the only person I feel really sorry for is the 50 year old boy
4944000	4948000	cause one, he got beaten the shit off by a fully grown cage fighter.
4948000	4952000	And also because he got taken advantage of by a nonce.
4952000	4956000	So, you know, what's interesting here is that in Canada, nonce means idiot.
4956000	4960000	It doesn't mean pedophile.
4960000	4964000	Nonce here means pedo.
4964000	4968000	That was the source of a lot of confusion for a long time when I was talking to British people.
4968000	4972000	You're just like, why would you want to kill idiots?
4972000	4976000	I mean, there's a good reason sometimes.
4976000	4980000	But you know what I mean though? Like it was, it was strange to hear.
4980000	4984000	It's just like, oh no, it, nonces are unforgivable. It's just like,
4984000	4988000	you can forgive people for being stupid.
4988000	4992000	All right, so let's see here. Um, jealous ex-convict
4992000	4996000	Paul Robson, who was 50, carried out a vicious
4996000	5000000	attack against Caroline Kale, 47, and her teenage lover
5000000	5004000	after he snooped and prowled outside of her home.
5004000	5008000	This is in the UK.
5008000	5012000	Yeah, no, it wasn't New Crassle Crown Court. This is around where I live.
5012000	5016000	It says
5016000	5020000	Linton, Northumberland.
5020000	5024000	Hold on, Linton. Give me a second. I'm gonna
5024000	5028000	switch over to the live screen for a second.
5028000	5032000	People won't be able to see the feed, but.
5032000	5036000	Northumberland.
5036000	5040000	Linton, Northumberland. Linton, Northumberland
5040000	5044000	map.
5044000	5048000	How close is that to you?
5048000	5052000	That's
5052000	5056000	literally within, hold on, I'll do the directions on
5056000	5060000	Google Maps. From my exact location,
5060000	5064000	it's about a 30 minute drive. Oh jeez, that's not far at all.
5064000	5068000	No, it's about a 30 minute drive.
5068000	5072000	You could probably get to where they are from me on public transport.
5072000	5076000	Oh jeez. So, let's see what happened.
5076000	5080000	Robson may have stamped and kicked on her, leaving her with unsurvivable
5080000	5084000	brain injuries, chopped off her hair in clumps, cut up her
5084000	5088000	clothes and slashed her buttocks. Injuries to her eyes and
5088000	5092000	neck bruising indicated she may have been strangled. He also
5092000	5096000	attacked the boy with scissors and a meat cleaver, sprayed
5096000	5100000	them both with ammonia and stole their phones, later updating
5100000	5104000	her social media pretending to be her while he was on the
5104000	5108000	run. Holy fuck. This guy's
5108000	5112000	crazy. Yeah, this dude is insane. This makes me
5112000	5116000	even more surprised that she did this, cause he's insane.
5116000	5120000	She must have known he was insane. So why would she
5120000	5124000	cheat, and furthermore, why would she cheat while being
5124000	5128000	a nonce at the same time?
5128000	5132000	This makes me think that she must have been, like, either
5132000	5136000	she had no regard for her own well-being, or her
5136000	5140000	urges to nonce were that strong that they overrode her self-preservation.
5140000	5144000	Cause something tells
5144000	5148000	me, for that kind of blow up, she had to have known he was
5148000	5152000	like, violent. Okay, hold on, there's something strange here.
5152000	5156000	Robson and Mrs. Kale, who were separated from her
5156000	5160000	prison officer husband, had lived together in Linton, but split up weeks
5160000	5164000	before the murder, and he found out she had started a relationship with the boy. It almost
5164000	5168000	sounds like she didn't cheat on him, she just started fucking the boy
5168000	5172000	after they broke up. Oh, okay.
5172000	5176000	Possibly, I don't know what the timeline is, but what the fuck?
5176000	5180000	But she sounds like a real piece of work herself, not
5180000	5184000	again, I'm not condoning what he did. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I know, I agree.
5184000	5188000	Well fucking, she cheats on her prison officer
5188000	5192000	boyfriend with him, then she breaks up with
5192000	5196000	him and starts noncing with a 15 year old boy, and then he comes
5196000	5200000	in and just goes ham on her.
5200000	5204000	Absolute fucking, what a shit show this entire story is.
5204000	5208000	Yeah, man. Oh god.
5212000	5216000	I'm trying to, this is
5216000	5220000	all stuff that I've already read, I'm trying to find
5220000	5224000	details of where the kid comes involved, and it's just, nope, she was just
5224000	5228000	fucking a kid. Alright, there's no
5228000	5232000	like extra story with him, it's just, she was
5232000	5236000	fucking a child, and he decided to go crazy and kill her. Wow.
5236000	5240000	What a fucking story. I know she's dead, but
5240000	5244000	surely they should probably give more emphasis on the fact that
5244000	5248000	what she was doing herself was incredibly illegal and immoral.
5248000	5252000	The article actually doesn't, like it mentions the fact that it's an underage
5252000	5256000	boy, but doesn't really play it up. I'm surprised, like
5256000	5260000	apparently, I guess he was just so violent, that's what the whole entire article is about.
5260000	5264000	Holy shit.
5264000	5268000	I just can't help but feel that they're trying to make me sympathize for someone
5268000	5272000	who I really feel no sympathy for at all.
5272000	5276000	Possibly, yes. Alright, let's continue.
5276000	5280000	Okay, here we go. I'm skipping this one, I'm gonna use this one for something else, I'm skipping this one.
5280000	5284000	90 day Beyonce star.
5284000	5288000	I make $50,000 a week selling my farts in a jar.
5292000	5296000	I mean, we've all got to make a living somehow.
5296000	5300000	A reality TV star is making waves on social
5300000	5304000	media after letting it rip, after letting it rip
5304000	5308000	that she makes more than $50,000 a week by selling her flatulence
5308000	5312000	to strangers. A video detailing her
5312000	5316000	smelly side hustle currently boasts 6.6
5316000	5320000	million views. That's the fart of the deal.
5324000	5328000	I thought farts were super niche,
5328000	5332000	but also something fun, quirky, and different, said Stephanie
5332000	5336000	Motto. She first gained international recognition
5336000	5340000	after appearing on the reality TV show 90 Day Fiancé, and she has since started
5340000	5344000	her own YouTube channel, and also, oh, she founded her own OnlyFans
5344000	5348000	clone called Unfiltered. Oh.
5348000	5352000	That's more of a fucking hustle than selling farts in a jar, lady.
5352000	5356000	Well, that's what I mean. It sounds like she's a businesswoman, but she's also doing this as a
5356000	5360000	side hustle. First of all, if you have successful,
5360000	5364000	if you have a successful business already,
5364000	5368000	what the fuck do you need to be doing this for?
5368000	5372000	This isn't desperation. This is just, she's fucking weird.
5372000	5376000	Listen, listen. $50,000 a week, though.
5376000	5380000	That's a lot of money. True. That is true, but freaking
5380000	5384000	can't help but feel that this isn't 100% necessary
5384000	5388000	for her to do. She eventually
5388000	5392000	turned to selling her jarred farts on a platform because she thought it'd be a hilarious
5392000	5396000	publicity move that would get a lot of people's attention. But then it turns out
5396000	5400000	that she, the gassy gal made $50,000
5400000	5404000	in one week from hawking her toots. Her unfiltered
5404000	5408000	inbox is flooded daily with people wanting to purchase jars of her farts
5408000	5412000	and that people frequently request videos of the production process
5412000	5416000	from caboose to container. So you want to buy
5416000	5420000	a video of this chick putting a jar up to her asshole and farting into it
5420000	5424000	and then quickly, quickly canning it so that the smell stays there for when you buy it.
5432000	5436000	I can't even blame her
5436000	5440000	really, because she's just responding to incentives. It's the guys who buy
5440000	5444000	the stuff that I really hate.
5444000	5448000	So, she
5448000	5452000	eats beans, a protein muffin, a yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, and sometimes
5452000	5456000	a protein shake, and then she fills the mason jar
5456000	5460000	with flower petals, because flower petals that are scentless can
5460000	5464000	absorb other scents and make the scents last longer. And then she farts
5464000	5468000	into the jar of flower petals.
5468000	5472000	I like how she's put thought into this.
5472000	5476000	Like, this isn't just a thing for her, this is a proper
5476000	5480000	business model. She's innovating on fart jars, what the fuck?
5480000	5484000	Man, okay.
5484000	5488000	I know that we were going on a couple years ago about gamer girl bathwater
5488000	5492000	or whatever, but this chick takes it to a whole other level.
5492000	5496000	That's what I mean. She has evolved thoughttery.
5496000	5500000	She's innovating thoughttery.
5500000	5504000	Fucking hell. Alright, what's next? What's next? Oh.
5504000	5508000	Hold on, let me just pause this. Tennessee man
5508000	5512000	pulls out an AK-47 after being told to
5512000	5516000	wait 10 minutes for his Little Caesars pizza.
5516000	5520000	Fuck. I guess he fucking wanted his pizza.
5520000	5524000	That's what I mean. That must have been some really good fucking pizza.
5524000	5528000	Have you had Little Caesars before? I haven't. I have and it's
5528000	5532000	actually really shit. It's like the cheapest, most cardboard fucking pizza
5532000	5536000	you can get. Like $8 for a pizza and it's just garbage.
5536000	5540000	Alright, cause my understanding was that
5540000	5544000	Little Caesars was like, my understanding is that Little Caesars did
5544000	5548000	like, what was it called, the hot and ready pizza
5548000	5552000	where basically they just take a pizza
5552000	5556000	that's already been made and put it in a box and give it to you really cheap.
5556000	5560000	Yes, they do. And it's not very good. It's pretty shitty. No, I can
5560000	5564000	imagine not. That sounds like something you would buy if you had like 15
5564000	5568000	minutes on the clock for a lunch break or something. And that is what I did
5568000	5572000	back, cause when I worked, the last grocery store job I worked at, there was Little Caesars
5572000	5576000	pizza in the area, like a 2 minute walk away, so I would do that all the time.
5576000	5580000	It was so fucking bad. Okay, so
5580000	5584000	one man allegedly went too far. When he told his Little Caesars pizza
5584000	5588000	was not hot and ready, he pulled an AK-47 on the employees.
5588000	5592000	He points the gun at me and he says, where's my pizza?
5592000	5596000	I want my pizza now.
5596000	5600000	He became upset when he was told that his pizza was not in fact
5600000	5604000	hot and ready, but he would have to wait 10 minutes for the pizza.
5604000	5608000	He left the store, went to his car and came back with the weapon.
5608000	5612000	So
5612000	5616000	another customer in the store who had gotten her pizza
5616000	5620000	gave it to him, which was enough to make him leave. The employees
5620000	5624000	then called the police who tracked him down and arrested him.
5624000	5628000	The employees started screaming, we are not
5628000	5632000	always hot and ready. Never listen to the commercial. We're not
5632000	5636000	always hot and ready.
5636000	5640000	I like how that's how, where her
5640000	5644000	mind turns to is the fact that the commercial is misleading and it's not
5644000	5648000	just, this guy's a fucking psycho.
5648000	5652000	Like, I'm sorry about our misleading
5652000	5656000	advertising, sir.
5656000	5660000	Right, okay, we have had a super chat so I'm going to address it.
5660000	5664000	No problem.
5664000	5668000	Merc for $5, thank you very much. Fart in jars
5668000	5672000	are the new NFTs.
5672000	5676000	Oh God. What does this AK-47 dude
5676000	5680000	do when his girlfriend isn't hot and ready?
5680000	5684000	Alright, here's the next one that I've got.
5684000	5688000	Bay Area car break-ins are on the rise, prompting
5688000	5692000	car owners to leave their trunks open.
5692000	5696000	Wait, isn't, wasn't this the thing that fucking
5696000	5700000	what's-his-face Seth Rogen
5700000	5704000	was saying wasn't an issue? Yes.
5704000	5708000	So it turns out that people
5708000	5712000	are just leaving their cars open with nothing in them so that the windows
5712000	5716000	don't get destroyed as people look through them.
5716000	5720000	Yeah, basically people are just saying, look, I
5720000	5724000	have fuck all to give you, so just leave me alone.
5724000	5728000	Yep.
5728000	5732000	And I like how Seth Rogen is so disconnected
5732000	5736000	from anything outside of California, at this point he says, oh yeah, the last 10 years
5736000	5740000	my car's been broken into 15 times, that's totally normal.
5740000	5744000	Yep. No, it's not. It's not normal.
5744000	5748000	Maybe it's a
5748000	5752000	Canadian thing, but even in our big cities there's not that much
5752000	5756000	thefts or car break-ins. Oh no, like, London
5756000	5760000	is the crime capital of the UK,
5760000	5764000	like with it being its capital city and also because it's
5764000	5768000	really poorly run, but it's like
5768000	5772000	and like we have rising gang warfare and rising knife
5772000	5776000	crime and all that stuff, your car will be fine.
5776000	5780000	So this person says
5780000	5784000	imagine having to clean out your car and leave it
5784000	5788000	open in the public just so people won't break the windows on it.
5788000	5792000	Oakland, we are looking sad, man.
5792000	5796000	Yeah. However, the police say you shouldn't do it because
5796000	5800000	they can steal your batteries, they can steal your tires, they can go into your glove department and find your
5800000	5804000	insurance, so you still shouldn't do this, but
5804000	5808000	no one's stopping these robbers.
5808000	5812000	Fuck. Just leave California, guys. Just get the fuck out of California.
5812000	5816000	I keep telling Lilith to move.
5816000	5820000	I know, but she keeps saying she's comfortable there, doesn't she? Well, what happened is she inherited
5820000	5824000	a house. Oh, I see. So, like, at the very
5824000	5828000	least she has to find a buyer for that if she was going to move and then move to a decent place.
5828000	5832000	And also, despite all of California's problems, the other areas of the states aren't exactly
5832000	5836000	as trans-friendly. That's like, okay, yeah, fair enough, I get it. I understand.
5836000	5840000	She just moved to Canada, fuck.
5840000	5844000	Even more conservative areas here, they're very much
5844000	5848000	like, we'll just leave you alone if you're not doing anything wrong. We don't care if you're trans kind of thing.
5848000	5852000	That's how things are here. It's pretty much the same in the
5852000	5856000	UK, it's just fucking, as long as you
5856000	5860000	don't, like, yeah, we're a bit grumpy, but as long as you mind
5860000	5864000	your own business, no one's going to give you trouble. Yep.
5864000	5868000	I'm going to continue on. I'm sorry I called the Grinch
5868000	5872000	anime. Please stop threatening my family.
5872000	5876000	Dear
5876000	5880000	vindictive Japanese cartoon watchers, you know me
5880000	5884000	as the sack of shit who referred to the Grinch as anime in a now
5884000	5888000	viral blog post. While I have some to regret,
5888000	5892000	while I have come to regret this post deeply, both personally and professionally,
5892000	5896000	for the sake of my family, I must humbly request that you cease
5896000	5900000	your highly coordinated retaliation, which has already escalated to an
5900000	5904000	alarming degree. Fucking hell, man.
5904000	5908000	First of all, you are wrong,
5908000	5912000	while you are wrong that the Grinch is not an anime, it's a cartoon,
5912000	5916000	and I will die on that hill, even though anime
5916000	5920000	is literally just short for animation, so.
5920000	5924000	The blowback began almost immediately with internet
5924000	5928000	user Yu Yu Hakusho Queer, who came out of
5928000	5932000	the box strong with, you pinhead fuck, the Grinch is not
5932000	5936000	anime, I'll ensure you and your family wake up every day in harm's
5936000	5940000	way. Minutes later, another user, Ms. Hente
5940000	5944000	Shawty, posted a Google 360 view of my mother's
5944000	5948000	apartment with the caption, his mom's crib, do ya thang.
5948000	5952000	The threatening remarks piled on, with a few users
5952000	5956000	taking it to the extreme by posting photos of baby carrots and claiming,
5956000	5960000	these are the author's penis. Those were not my penis.
5960000	5964000	No shit. From slanderous to
5964000	5968000	dangerous, no heinous comments were off limits from anime
5968000	5972000	fans. It's the intimidation of my family members that have crossed moral
5972000	5976000	bounds, the threats via email and snail mail, the bodily
5976000	5980000	fluids on their porches, the multiple incidents of dumping hot
5980000	5984000	hookah coals into my mother's shoes. It has all been
5984000	5988000	shamefully too far, and for what it's worth, this is the sort of holiday destruction
5988000	5992000	the Grinch would have wanted. I sincerely apologize
5992000	5996000	for calling how the Grinch stole Christmas anime
5996000	6000000	and for calling the Grinch one of the best guys in anime. This is not
6000000	6004000	the half-hearted apology of a man fearing for the life of his family
6004000	6008000	and the well-being of his mother.
6008000	6012000	This is such a stupid article.
6012000	6016000	It's literally just a case of, it's like, this reads
6016000	6020000	like an absurdist post. Like fucking
6020000	6024000	why are people sending death threats to this guy because he called the Grinch anime?
6024000	6028000	The thing is... Even calling the Grinch anime sounds like a shit post.
6028000	6032000	I have a feeling, yeah yeah, you know what this is?
6032000	6036000	He did call the Grinch an anime, and he did get
6036000	6040000	a blowback from it, but this is him making fun of the blowback.
6040000	6044000	That's what this is. That sounds more plausible to me,
6044000	6048000	actually. Yeah, because The Hard Times
6048000	6052000	is not a satire site in the same way as The Babylon Bee, but
6052000	6056000	it does do these kind of jokey posts, yeah. I would certainly
6056000	6060000	hope so, because otherwise, anime fans, you're different from
6060000	6064000	when I was at my peak of anime fandom, but you need to calm
6064000	6068000	the fuck down. Okay, there's
6068000	6072000	like four articles left but we're running out of time, so I'm gonna do the last one.
6072000	6076000	I'm gonna do the one that I intended to end the show on, because this is
6076000	6080000	fucking hilarious. Check this out. Somehow
6080000	6084000	Adolf Hitler has received a COVID vaccine passport
6084000	6088000	in the EU. I told you
6088000	6092000	it was the Fourth Reich.
6092000	6096000	The private key used to sign the EU's digital COVID certificates
6096000	6100000	appears to have leaked, leading to forged certificates for people,
6100000	6104000	even dead ones like Hitler. The former Supreme Leader
6104000	6108000	of 1940s Germany would appear to be alive and well if the EU's
6108000	6112000	digital vaccination program is to be believed.
6112000	6116000	Actually, he's doing better than well. He's been vaccinated for COVID-19.
6116000	6120000	Well, very nice. Yeah, no, Hitler is still
6120000	6124000	dead, don't worry. Yeah, nobody's, nobody's out there, you know,
6124000	6128000	making clones of Hitler and like raising them up in cryogenic
6128000	6132000	stasis in Argentina or something, all right? No one's actually doing that.
6132000	6136000	It's not some really cringey action movie where he takes off his glasses and goes, my god,
6136000	6140000	he's back.
6140000	6144000	It would appear that someone has gotten their hands on the private cryptographic
6144000	6148000	key used to certify digital COVID-19 vaccination
6148000	6152000	cards in certain European countries and has been forging bullshit
6152000	6156000	certificates for real people. Cyber criminals in the dark web were recently
6156000	6160000	spotted selling access to what they claimed were forged digital vaccination
6160000	6164000	certificates for $300 a pop. When asked by journalists what they were doing,
6164000	6168000	one criminal provided them with a working, a working vaccine certificate
6168000	6172000	for Adolf Hitler. In addition to the former dictator, approved
6172000	6176000	vaccine passports for Mickey Mouse and SpongeBob SquarePants were also
6176000	6180000	being hawked. Well, you have to, you have to imagine
6180000	6184000	that he doesn't want to get isolated in Mickey Mouse's clubhouse
6184000	6188000	and you know, Bikini Bottom's been on lockdown for the past
6188000	6192000	six months, so you know, he wants to get outside, he wants to breathe some
6192000	6196000	fresh air again. The fake but approved
6196000	6200000	certificates were recently viewed and they were able to verify
6200000	6204000	that Hitler's was still working as of Thursday.
6204000	6208000	The fake certificates appear to be sourced from some kind of compromise of the EU's
6208000	6212000	digital vaccination certificate program, which is Europe's recently instituted
6212000	6216000	effort to ensure that all citizens are vaxxed before they can travel or attend most
6216000	6220000	recreational events. Also called the Green Pass, the certificate
6220000	6224000	can be obtained through a variety of methods, either via health agencies or testing
6224000	6228000	centres following vaccination. And it's pretty much a requirement if you want to see a movie,
6228000	6232000	eat a restaurant, or do anything that involves fun. According to the European Commission, the pass
6232000	6236000	contains a QR code with a digital signature. However, it would appear that
6236000	6240000	the private key responsible for validating those certificates has been leaked
6240000	6244000	or misused. Because now they're just making a bunch of joke certificates.
6244000	6248000	That's fucking great. Man.
6248000	6252000	Actually, as someone in the chat pointed out, Adolf Hitler
6252000	6256000	literally won an election in Namibia last year. I did that article too.
6256000	6260000	There was a guy who was, it was a former German colony
6260000	6264000	and they didn't really know much about World War II. So people there
6264000	6268000	were just naming their kids after like their grandparents or whatever. And they had, they sometimes had
6268000	6272000	German names. So one kid grows up with the name Adolf Hitler
6272000	6276000	not knowing what it means and he wins an election
6276000	6280000	in Namibia. And then he has to like tell the world, uh, I know I don't
6280000	6284000	intend to take over the entire world. I'm sorry.
6284000	6288000	Fucking.
6288000	6292000	You sometimes forget the
6292000	6296000	fucking, just how big the world is, don't you?
6296000	6300000	Bullshit can happen.
6300000	6304000	So it seems like someone got a hold
6304000	6308000	of how you make these certificates and has just been making fake ones.
6308000	6312000	Like crazy. Including one for Adolf Hitler.
6312000	6316000	I like how he hasn't just been making fake ones for other people. He's just been
6316000	6320000	making shitpost ones as well. To be fair, he's probably doing both.
6320000	6324000	He's just doing the other ones like silently. That's happening here. There's like
6324000	6328000	there are doctors who don't agree with the vaccine passports, even
6328000	6332000	though they're like pro-vax and they will just give you an exemption now.
6332000	6336000	Cause like, fuck it, we got to stop this. So there are some doctors who are just like silently handing out
6336000	6340000	exemptions. Yeah. And there's like a lot of places here that aren't
6340000	6344000	accepting them either. You know, they're not, they're not
6344000	6348000	when places, like, okay, hold on.
6348000	6352000	Now you have to have your phone scanned to go into a restaurant, but there are some restaurants here that are just like
6352000	6356000	we're not going to bother with that shit. That's fucking bullshit. We're not going to scan.
6356000	6360000	It's like, oh, cool. That's how it should be. No one should be listening to this anymore. It's fucking ridiculous.
6360000	6364000	Anyway, that's the articles.
6364000	6368000	I have like five more, but we've run out of time. So I will do
6368000	6372000	those next week. It's not a big deal. Let me just, okay.
6372000	6376000	Yeah. I have switched, yeah, I have switched us back to
6376000	6380000	the live, to the live screen. So it's literally just the picture of Shinji with a
6380000	6384000	coffee. Shinji?
6384000	6388000	Shinji with a coffee. Yeah. Why Shinji though?
6388000	6392000	Because it was the weekly sip and it was the first thing that came to mind that was both anime
6392000	6396000	and was coffee related.
6396000	6400000	Awesome. Plus it was
6400000	6404000	the thing about Shinji is that he looks vaguely like me if I was
6404000	6408000	if I was thin and scrawny. And also the fact that
6408000	6412000	he also like, he looked, it's
6412000	6416000	in that picture, he just looks mildly unimpressed.
6416000	6420000	So wait,
6420000	6424000	are you saying that you would jack off over an unconscious woman's body?
6424000	6428000	No, I would not do that.
6428000	6432000	You wouldn't do, you wouldn't do the ultimate Shinji move?
6432000	6436000	I'm so fucked up.
6436000	6440000	Actually, okay, that got
6440000	6444000	back when that movie first came out in like 2005 or whatever it was, that movie
6444000	6448000	got put on Canada's official list of banned, banned
6448000	6452000	movies because of child porn in it.
6452000	6456000	Because it showed Asuka's tits. Oh God.
6456000	6460000	Canada is terrible when it comes to animated CP like
6460000	6464000	stuff. Okay. If you, if you own a copy of that movie
6464000	6468000	in Canada, like a legit copy that you bought, you can go to jail for the same length
6468000	6472000	of time as a child molester.
6472000	6476000	Yeah. That's fucked. And here's the thing,
6476000	6480000	nobody wants to tackle the problem because who wants to be the guy
6480000	6484000	that like takes on that bad optics, you know, of
6484000	6488000	oh, you're the one who wants to make drawn child porn legal.
6488000	6492000	It's like Jesus. Even, everyone knows
6492000	6496000	that it's stupid, it's too far, but no one wants to be the person who has that
6496000	6500000	on their legacy, you know what I mean?
6500000	6504000	Yeah, I get what you mean. Right. We do have
6504000	6508000	Jackson for five dollars, thank you very much. Trans Acceptance is
6508000	6512000	so far in Canada that my very conservative parents over ten years ago
6512000	6516000	were not willing to accept I was trans just because I cross-dressed on a
6516000	6520000	dare once.
6520000	6524000	That sounds about right. Like lots of Canadians are, lots of Canadians are just
6524000	6528000	like, I don't care what you do in private, just as long as you're not like
6528000	6532000	being fucking ridiculous like a lot of people are, as long as you're just like
6532000	6536000	being a regular person, you can do whatever weird shit you want. It's like, okay, cool. You know, that's how it should be.
6536000	6540000	Yeah, that sounds violently Canadian.
6540000	6544000	Like, nobody likes pride parades,
6544000	6548000	nobody likes big demonstrations, nobody likes violent demonstrations.
6548000	6552000	But if you're just like, if you're gay or if you're trans and you're just hanging out and being a regular
6552000	6556000	person, nobody here gives a shit.
6556000	6560000	It's like, yeah, it's pretty much the same in the UK.
6560000	6564000	You will get some areas where people, where like the odd individual
6564000	6568000	will be a dick about it, but for the most part it is just people
6568000	6572000	who are just like, alright, fair enough.
6572000	6576000	Like, let's take, like
6576000	6580000	I'm sure if you've kept up with Count Dankula,
6580000	6584000	like Count Dankula's Twitter, you'll have seen a regular poster on there called
6584000	6588000	Femboy Blacksmith.
6588000	6592000	He goes to college dressed in girls' clothes
6592000	6596000	and no one cares. Like,
6596000	6600000	no one gives a shit.
6600000	6604000	And as far as I can remember, it's been like that since the 90s. Like, maybe not earlier, like in the
6604000	6608000	80s had some legit homophobia floating around in there, but then
6608000	6612000	when the 90s came around, it was like, who cares anymore?
6612000	6616000	People were just like, private, you know?
6616000	6620000	Well, put it this way. In the 1960s, I think it was a case of like,
6620000	6624000	two thirds of people found homosexuality to be, you know,
6624000	6628000	like horrible. And then by
6628000	6632000	97, I think it was, this is a statistic I saw years
6632000	6636000	ago, so I might be getting the exact date wrong. I think it was something like
6636000	6640000	only 10% of people found homosexuality to be wrong.
6640000	6644000	Yep. Yep. Honestly, like a lot of those
6644000	6648000	social problems have been solved at this point. People are just getting crazy online
6648000	6652000	over fucking nothing.
6652000	6656000	All right. I think that's about the end for me though. Who do you have on next?
6656000	6660000	Single player Carl and Charles Akitsune.
6660000	6664000	I'm supposed to go on their podcast at some point. That's right.
6664000	6668000	Yeah. It's a good podcast. It's a good laugh.
6668000	6672000	I'm an editor for Single Player Carl,
6672000	6676000	so he's like, not only is it a good
6676000	6680000	laugh, they're also very interesting to talk to. So I'd highly recommend it.
6680000	6684000	Right, right. Does, does Chaos Charge still work
6684000	6688000	for It's a Gundam? I know he was like his
6688000	6692000	either editor or something along those lines for a while.
6692000	6696000	Well, he did rig the
6696000	6700000	Gundam 3D model for him. Yes. I'm not sure
6700000	6704000	if he was ever like an editor or something. He's not stewed.
6704000	6708000	That's a misconception. People thought he was stew. He's not.
6708000	6712000	That's a misconception, but he
6712000	6716000	I do know that he did rig his 3D model for him. Oh, who's stew then?
6716000	6720000	Stew's just a character. It's made up.
6720000	6724000	Yeah, see, I think that's why last time I talked to Gundam, he said
6724000	6728000	that Charza was stew in spirit.
6728000	6732000	Yeah. Because basically
6732000	6736000	what happened was is that people started assuming that and he said
6736000	6740000	and people, so, and it kind of Charza started
6740000	6744000	going along with it for a laugh, just, you know,
6744000	6748000	started going along with it just, you know, to
6748000	6752000	just for a laugh, but it got so prevalent that Gundam kind of pulled him
6752000	6756000	aside and said, yeah, we're going to have to stop doing that now because people actually believe it's
6756000	6760000	true. Oh, well.
6760000	6764000	Yeah. And to be fair, Dave on my side of things, Dave is a real person.
6764000	6768000	I mean, kind of. He's like, he's half alive.
6768000	6772000	He's in a constant state
6772000	6776000	of potential undeath, but he is
6776000	6780000	technically in a legal sense alive.
6780000	6784000	Yes, yes, that is the case.
6784000	6788000	Jackson for another $5. I feel I should clarify this was in Alberta as well.
6788000	6792000	Okay, fair enough. Yeah, Alberta is like Canada's Texas.
6792000	6796000	Lots of oil, lots of conservatives, lots of people who want to leave Canada.
6796000	6800000	It's basically the same thing culturally as Texas is.
6800000	6804000	And even then, they're still very live and let live there.
6804000	6808000	You know? Yeah. Alright, I should probably
6808000	6812000	go then because it is 12.59 and my time's up at 1.
6812000	6816000	So, I will see you later, man.
6816000	6820000	Right, I'll catch you about. Thanks for listening. Yeah, no problem.
6820000	6824000	See you later, Chat. Thanks for coming in. Bye-bye.
6824000	6828000	And there we go. That's that. Definitely a very different
6828000	6832000	weekly sip, but hey, it's always good to try something new.
6832000	6836000	I will see you guys later. I gotta stream tonight.
6836000	6840000	More Yakuza. I know usually Adam and Sitch stream, but fuck it.
6840000	6844000	I gotta catch up on my Yakuza playthrough on the gaming channel, so
6844000	6848000	drop by the Twitch channel tonight or on the gaming YouTube, one or the other.
6848000	6852000	And hopefully I'll have a new video for you tomorrow. Catch you next time,
6852000	6854000	guys! I love you.
