WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Hi! I'm here!

00:04.000 --> 00:08.000
Hello. We were just whinging about you being late.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Oh. Well, you know how it is, right? It's kinda normal.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
Yeah, it's perfectly normal. That was what we were whinging about.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
I gotta go tell everybody. Hold on a second.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
I gotta actually let everybody know what's going on. I put out a video that said

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
come over in an hour, but I should probably just annoy everyone with a bunch of

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
everyone's. So, at everyone

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
the weekly sip is live.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
Give me a second here. I'll post it on Twitter too.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Okay. That's cool. Thank you. Appreciate it.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
So, how's it going?

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
It's going fantastic. Thank you for turning up to Shitpost

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
with me for a while, Dev. Yeah, no problem.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
It's been a while. A year or two. It has been.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
I think the last time we streamed together was

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
the follow-up interview for Exploring the Politosphere, which was

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
ages ago. Couple years, yeah.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Does everyone have their coffee? Wait, do you have your tea? I mean, you're a

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
BritBong, so you have to have tea. I drink neither, so

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
I am going to disappoint everyone with Pepsi bags.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
What kind of a BritBonger doesn't drink tea?

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
One who actually has taste buds, Dev. Oh, you don't

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
like tea? No, not at all.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
It's leaf water with milk and sugar in it.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
That's honestly very surprising, actually.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
And I don't drink coffee because I know if I start drinking it

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
on top. Listen, it's really good.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm sure it is, but that's exactly...

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
Oh god, I'm very coffee right now, and I don't mean to drink, I mean I'm coughing

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
a lot. I don't have the Coof,

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
though. I've already had it twice. I had, back in April 2020,

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
I had Coof One, Coof Original, and then

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
in October, I had the Delta

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
variant. So, people who say that the Coof isn't real seem to be

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
retarded, but it's not that bad.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Most people are so bad at that shit. I think I got Coof Two

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Delta Boogaloo

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
a few months ago,

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
but it literally was just like a bad cold. Oh, did you get tested?

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
No, but I didn't get

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
any. I got symptoms that I

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
don't normally get when I get a cold or a flu.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
And like, including like shortness of breath, which

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
only really, which only really, which means it was attacking my lungs, which it doesn't

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
never happens to me when I get the flu. Right, right.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
I mean, I got tested and it was confirmed, so that's

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
I mean, oh god, you know,

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
it is sometimes hard to support those who are against

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
the current establishment when they say such ridiculous things as

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
COVID doesn't exist. And it's like, come the fuck on.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
How, how much tinfoil do you have to be wearing to actually believe that?

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Like you can, you can, you can, you know, wonder about vaccines, you can

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
complain about lockdowns because that's completely reasonable, but like

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
COVID doesn't exist seems to be a ridiculous position

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
to hold. At least I think so.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Here's the thing. I have only just recently got my first shot because I was holding

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
out for a while to see about, you know, like long-term effects and

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
whatnot. Yeah. But then they started, basically because

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
I'm a student and also I work in an industry

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
tangentially connected to the NHS, I was basically being pressured

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
on all angles, so I eventually just had to concede. Otherwise

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
I would have likely lost my job and been stuck

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
studying at home for another, for another term.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Another five years.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
So I was like, you might as

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
well. And it's, so I only just recently got

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
the first jab, but it's fine. Like,

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
I don't necessarily have a problem with vaccines in general.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
I just, I did feel there was a bit to be said about it

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
being rushed through trials and whatnot. Yeah.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
So I just, so, so I got it

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
recently and it's been fine. The worst I got was that my

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
muscle was stiff. Yeah. See for me, what ended

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
up happening was like, I was considering getting it, but I was

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
also waiting for the trials to be done. And they, they finished up like this past summer, right?

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
I was like, okay, they seem to be like safe enough. All right, fine. Trials are over.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Nothing's really been uncovered. Nothing too crazy. Fine. And so

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
the, the plan was because I work from home

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
and everybody else who lives with me in this house, they don't. The idea

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
would be that, um, I, they would just get their shots first and

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
I would take care of them if something bad happened. And then once everyone else was

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
immunized, then I would get it. Um,

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
so everyone got their shots. And then when it came time for me to get mine,

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
the Ontario government announced the vaccine passport.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
And I was just like, well, I'm not going to fucking comply with this. This is ridiculous.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
So now, and honestly, now that I've had COVID, I don't really care. I've had the Delta variant.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
I really don't care. Like there's natural immunity. Natural immunity is real. So

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
now I'm just like, I'm not going to lend any of my,

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
my own personal legitimacy, however little that might be

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
to a vaccine passport that I fundamentally don't, don't agree with.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
So now I'm just not going to get it. Fuck it.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Yeah, I can totally understand that. Political jargon for $10.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
Thank you very much. Fan of death. I don't have much to give, but here's some for a good cause.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Thank you very much. Um, anyway. Oh, I forgot to

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
I forgot to ask, what's the cause?

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Cancer Research UK. What is that? It's a, it's a, it's a charity to

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
research cures for cancer. Oh, oh, you said cancer

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
research. I think you said council research UK and I was like, what?

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
No, Cancer Research UK. All right. Oh, oh,

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
so, uh, have you talked about what happened at the start of your show yet?

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
What do you mean? Well, I know

06:48.000 --> 06:52.000
Aiden was supposed to be on. She messaged me and she told me, did she tell you what's going on? Why she didn't, why she

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
she was, she was late. Yeah. Wasn't it to do with something to do with her family?

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Yeah, it was a family thing that came up. So she sends her apologies.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
No, that's fine. I told her, I told her

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
I was less annoyed that she didn't turn up and I was more annoyed the fact that this is the

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
second time in a row she hasn't turned up. But I basically

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
I basically just told her that it was fine and not to, not to worry about it.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
She's a really nice person, but I know that she, she gets

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
she, she has a tendency to like worry if people hate her. I've noticed.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
Yeah, it's, she is a, she's a lovely lass, but she's just

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
it was, I was just, I was a little bit salty

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
at first, but then I just decided, cause fuck it. Yeah, right.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
It's not worth getting salty

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
about. It's a 12 hour stream and we managed to get through the first topic

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
with just the, with the guests we had, so

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
it wasn't a bother. Yeah, fair enough.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Jesus.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
Maybe I've got Omicron. I'm just going to get all the COVID's.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
Oh, you, you dying? Kinda, I don't know why.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
Actually, you know what it is? It's where I live.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Um, the climate, the specific climate in this like one location

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
in Canada is just dry. It's very, very dry

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
in the winter. Um, and you don't have this in the UK because it's just

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
a difference. Um, we get, we get cold

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
enough here in the winter in Canada that water can no longer evaporate.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
Um, so it just freezes.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Water, so in the winter you'll have no clouds and

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
the sky is always sunny and blue, but it's like

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
minus 60 degrees Celsius out and the air

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
is extremely dry. So you just like, you're just

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
constantly coughing and, and Fleming because, and like everything is just dry.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
Jesus, it's awful. For, for the most part here

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
it's like minus two in the middle of the night and it's like, like right now

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
it's four degrees Celsius. Yeah.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
I'm not worried about global warming in the slightest because Jesus, it's so cold

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
here. I wouldn't mind a little bit. The thing is

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
with the UK is that where it is in terms of latitude

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
it should be a lot colder than it is, but we also get because of

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
where specifically, where we sit on the planet, we get, we get

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
warm current, warm air currents from the south, which heat up the

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
country all year round. So we're like a few, like we're like

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
a good, maybe five, 10 degrees hotter than we should be.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
Well, the, uh, the west coast of Canada gets the same thing cause of the ocean

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
warm currents. So Vancouver right now is like our

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
early summer, you know, I'm just freezing.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
It's like, all right, thanks.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
But it's kind of interesting though, because I'm far enough north that

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
there's not much snow. It's all just ice. We have sheets

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
of ice that come down rather than snow.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
The only person, the only person who knows what I'm talking about whenever I talk

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
about this with people is Arch cause he's in Norway. They have the same thing.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
Fucking, I don't get how you can live

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
like if you don't, if you went much further north, you'd be living a fucking

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Well, when I did live further north,

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
um, there were tunnels underneath some sidewalks

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
that allowed you to get to certain parts in the city really easily without having to expose

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
yourself to the air. And that's just how they do it when you go far north, I guess.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
That's actually pretty cool. That's actually pretty cool infrastructure. I'd like to see that at some point.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
Unfortunately, it was built with taxation, pal.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Fucking, don't go there. We're not having that conversation today.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
I'm going to kill him with laughter and then I win the argument by default.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
Is that how it works?

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
I don't know.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
I'm pulling from the Jeremy Corbyn book of victories.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
Hey, didn't he come out as based recently?

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
Was he being like anti-vax or like, sorry, anti-vacuum passport?

11:22.000 --> 11:26.000
No, that was his brother, Pierce Corbyn. Oh, what's his deal?

11:26.000 --> 11:30.000
He's basically, he, do you know

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
how all the lefty revolutionary larpers like hate anyone who's actually

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
revolutionary because it reveals their larp?

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
Sometimes. I have seen people like Castro though.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Basically, Pierce Corbyn is the

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
actual revolutionary to the larp revolutionary that is

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
Jeremy Corbyn. Okay. So when he's out there talking

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
about like burning down the houses of MPs or something?

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Yeah, he's out there saying, we need to burn down the houses

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
of MPs. We can't put up with this anymore in response to like

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
like lot of facts, like COVID lockdowns and stuff.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
He actually got arrested today as well. For saying that?

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Yeah. Because it's considered, I think they said

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
it's considered cause to violence. Damn.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
I mean, I guess it is technically if you think about it.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
So basically he is the actual revolutionary to the

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
Jeremy Corbyn's larp revolutionary. Alright.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
But he's coming at it from a left wing perspective I guess?

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah, he's a lefty revolutionary but he's like, he's

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
slightly more acceptable than the American progressive because he's kind of an

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
old school lefty English

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
old school English lefty, like this sort of

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
George Orwell type lefty. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know what you mean.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
So I don't know how many weekly sips you've watched over the years.

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
I've done quite a bit of them, but the basic idea of the show

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
the basic idea of the show is

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
I usually shit post just talking with the chat and talking with people for

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
about half an hour. And then I do the

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
I do articles and I go over a series of articles. It's usually

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
a random number from a random time period. The idea is

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
over the course of a week I will research for various video topics

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
and I'll store them up and I'll store them away and I might not make those videos that week but I'll at least

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
store up the sources that I collect. However, when I find an article

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
that is interesting enough to be talked about

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
but does not actually fit into any kind of larger video

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
I put that aside and those ones that I've collected

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
for the week I do on the weekly sip.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
That's the process of how I do this show.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
Right, okay. I need a method

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
of seeing the things so you can either send me them

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
or you can screen share and I'll

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
screen feed Streamlabs. I should be able to screen share with you

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
let's see how it works.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
720, oh jeez I can't do 1080.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
God dammit. If I hit go live

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
there it is.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
So there it is. Can you see that?

14:40.000 --> 14:44.000
Hold on, I'll screen feed

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
there we are. You'll pipe it in? Yeah, now

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
they should be able to see it. Wait, why is Mitch saying

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
eww dev? Fucking, cause

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
Mitch is being a silly boy and he always

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
isn't. Isn't he the

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
guy who had the one like grossed out Pepe avatar

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
and he had to say that he's not cringe political opinions?

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
Yeah, that was his name for a while, not cringe political boast.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
He's a

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
good boy. I like Mitch but. Yeah, I've talked to him once.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah, he does love to take the piss

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
so does me.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
Jeremy Corbyn actually voted against Boris'

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
plan B restrictions. Jesus.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Yeah. What a weird situation you guys are finding yourself in.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
The thing is, you'll find that that is not

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
a principled opposition. That is an opposition

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
based in attempts at

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
getting popular. Because

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
the socialist wing of the Labour party

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
are on the defense right now because Keir Starmer

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
took over from Jeremy Corbyn and he's, I wouldn't say he's entirely a

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Blairite but he's more of an election.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
You're cutting out a bit for me, geez. I was just saying

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
he's more of a Blair, like

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
Keir Starmer's taken over the Labour party

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
and he's closer to a Blairite than he is to a Momentum

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
guy. He's not from the socialist wing of the

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
Labour party. Right, right. And so the socialist wing of the

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Labour party will just go against the, whatever

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
the Blairites do which, and the Blairites seem to be supporting the Tories

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
from lockdown stuff. Yeah.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
So, I've collected my articles and here they are.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
I think you'll like this first one. Right.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Because it'll probably, it'll probably tickle that

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
ANCAP funny bone of yours. So let's read it here.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
These parents built a school app. Then the city called the cops.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
Oh for fuck's sake.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.000
Like, fuck you. Let people homeschool their kids.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
No, no, that's not what it was. The official app was a disaster

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
so knowledgeable parents built an open source alternative.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
Oh, I see. Oh, I like this.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
Okay, so.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
Christian Langren's patience was running out.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
Every day the separated father of three was wasting precious time

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
trying to get the city of Stockholm's official school system to

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
work properly. Langren would dig through endless

17:52.000 --> 17:56.000
convoluted menus to find out what his children were doing at school. If working out

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
what his children needed in their gym kit was a hassle, then working out

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
how to report them as sick was a nightmare.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
I have done a big sip, Tidge. You missed it. Here, I'll do one for you right now. Hold on.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
That's good stuff, man. Ah, yeah. Start drinking coffee.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
It's good for you. Okay.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
Two years after its launch in August 2018, the Skoll platform

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
had become a constant thorn in the side of thousands of parents

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
across Sweden's capital city. Commissioned

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
in 2013, the system was intended to make the lives of up to 500,000 children,

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
teachers, and parents in Stockholm easier, acting as the technical

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
backbone for all things education, from registering attendance to keeping a record of grades.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
The platform was a complex system made up of three different parts, containing 18

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
individual modules that are maintained by five external companies. The sprawling system is used by

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
600 preschools and 177 schools, with separate

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
logins for every teacher, student, and parent. The only problem

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
is that it doesn't work.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
It was a huge red flag when they said five different companies.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
This tells me that this is an app that's been made by

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
committee, and anything made by committee tends to be shit.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
Generally, you need a singular

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
coherent vision, and you can delegate

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
the creation of that vision to different people, but it needs to be a singular

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
vision. Video games actually have that problem quite a lot

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
as well, with a game being pulled in a thousand

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
and one different direction. It ends up

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
not fulfilling any of it.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
You keep cutting out for me, man. Do you have an auto-closer on your mic?

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
I don't think so.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
There's a way to set up in Discord.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.000
User settings, voice and video, and then you'll have

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
automatically determine input sensitivity. If you turn that down

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
a bit, it might be a bit better. Hold on.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
Sorry, where was it again? So user settings,

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
then voice and video,

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
and then it says input sensitivity,

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
and it says automatically determine input sensitivity.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
You can slide. Because what it sounds like is at the end of your

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
sentences, when your voice goes a little bit quieter, it's cutting it off.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
Wait, so

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
am I dragging it upwards or downwards?

20:40.000 --> 20:44.000
It's left or right.

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
Am I dragging it left or right? If you go left,

20:48.000 --> 20:52.000
then that should actually lower the noise floor.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
So it shouldn't cut you off. Right, okay. Is that better?

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
It seems like it, yes. You already haven't cut off

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
once. Right, that's decent. Fair enough.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
So to continue on, the Skoal platform

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
has cost more than 1 billion Swedish krona,

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
$117 million, and it's failed to match the initial

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
ambition. Parents and teachers have complained about the complexity of the system.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
The launch was delayed, there have been reports of project mismanagement,

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
and it has been labeled an IT disaster.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
The Android version of the app has an average 1.2

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
star rating. Oof, that sounds awful.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Just give me a second here. I love democracy.

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
I don't, but you know.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
Okay, let me just keep reading.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
Because this is a long article, we don't got to read all of it. I just kind of have the certain,

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
the certain bits. Yeah. So Lang Drin, he's a developer and the

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
CEO of a Swedish innovation consulting firm.

22:00.000 --> 22:04.000
He has a hat, which was emblazoned with the words

22:04.000 --> 22:08.000
Skrota Skoal platform, loosely translated as trash the school platform.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
He joked that he should wear the hat when he picks his children up from school.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
Weeks later, wearing the hat, he decided to

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
take matters into his own hands. From my own frustration,

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
I just decided to create my own app. Oh,

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
he's just going for it. He wrote to city officials asking to see Skoal

22:28.000 --> 22:32.000
platform's API documents. While waiting for a response,

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
he logged into his account and tried to work out whether the system could be reverse engineered.

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
In just a few hours, he had created something that worked.

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
I had. Absolutely.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
Absolutely based in innovation build. I had information

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
on my screen from the Skoal platform. Then I started building an API

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
on top of their lousy API. The work started at the end of

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
November, 2020, just days after Stockholm's board of education was hit

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
with a 4 million fine for serious shortcomings in the app.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
Sweden's data regulator had found serious

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
flaws in the platform that exposed the data of hundreds of thousands of parents,

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
children, and teachers.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
People's personal information could be accessed from Google searches.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
That's what I'm saying. This school system just

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
doxxed a bunch of people. Fuck me, man.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
Oh my god. Incompetence.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
In the weeks that followed, Langdren teamed up with fellow developers

23:36.000 --> 23:40.000
and parents and they hatched a plan. They would create an open source version

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
of the Skoal platform and release it as an app.

23:44.000 --> 23:48.000
Building on Langdren's earlier work, they opened up Chrome's developer tools,

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
logged into the Skoal platform, and wrote down all of the URLs and payloads.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
They took the code, which called the platform's private API and built packages so it

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
could run on a phone, essentially creating a layer on top of the existing

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
glitchy Skoal platform. The result was the

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
Opna Skoal platform, or open school platform. It was

24:08.000 --> 24:12.000
released on February 12th, 2021. All of its code is published under an open

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
source license on GitHub. Anyone can take and use the code

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
with very few limitations on what can be done with it, what they can do with it.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
If the city wanted to use the code, they could. But rather than welcome it with

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
open arms, city officials reacted with indignation.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Even before the app was released, the city government warned

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
Langdren that it might be illegal.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
How is it illegal to make an

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
open source app? Probably because it's using like school information

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
or something. It's just going to be

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
governments mad that a private citizen did something better. That's what the story is, basically.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
Well, that's what I mean. It's basically just

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
state mad that state got proven incompetent.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
So, in the eight months that followed, the city of Stockholm

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
attempted to derail and shut down the app. It warned parents to stop using the app

25:08.000 --> 25:12.000
and alleged that it might be illegally accessing people's personal information.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
Officials reported the app to data protection authorities and

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
Langdren claims tweaked the official system's underlying code to stop

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
the app from operating at all. Then in April, the city announced it was

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
getting the police involved. Officials claimed the app and its co-founders

25:28.000 --> 25:32.000
may have committed a criminal data breach and asked cyber crime

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
investigators to look into how the app worked.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
The move took Langdren, who had been meeting with city officials, to address

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
concerns about the app by surprise.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
Well, this is basically just like going, this

25:48.000 --> 25:52.000
feels very like, very by the numbers

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
state action, just don't question us.

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
Question us and we'll, they're trying to make an example of this bloke because

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
he showed them up. Yeah. Basically like their solution sucked,

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
he made one that's better and they don't like that.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
That's all it is. So, the

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
Opna Skull platform is not a complicated app.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
While the official school platform is built for everyone involved in education in the Swedish

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
capital, its open source alternative is just for parents.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
The one Euro app has been downloaded around

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
12,500 times on iPhone and Android

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
with an average 4.2 star rating and it only shows basic information.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
Parents log in,

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
12,500 downloads for like an

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
education app, that's pretty good actually.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
Parents log in using the Swedish digital identity

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
system bank ID, that already sounds fucking awful right there.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
I didn't know the Swedes had that, but okay.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
The bank ID is also used by the Skull platform. They can then see information about

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
their children that's pulled into the app through the Skull platform API. The app shows

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
school calendars and events such as music concerts, a daily schedule for pupils,

27:12.000 --> 27:16.000
notifications from teachers that link out to grades and news updates, food that's being served in cafeterias,

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
and an option to report children that are sick. Everything that we

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
display is open and public information.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
He explains that when the students grades are shown, they are displayed

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
through an in-app browser where the app can't access any data.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
So basically they built an app

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
that took the data from the other app that was glitchy as fuck

27:40.000 --> 27:44.000
and made it actually work. And that's why they're complaining.

27:44.000 --> 27:48.000
They're complaining because they did something better. Yeah.

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
It really, this just really gets on my last nerve

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
because it treats, it's treating private citizens

27:56.000 --> 28:00.000
like they're criminals just because they

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
had the nerve to innovate on

28:04.000 --> 28:08.000
like build upon what the state was doing. Not even directly go against

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
the state, just build upon what the state had done and make it better.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
Yep. Yep. Exactly.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
And doing it, and not even using

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
state funds either. They did it like under their own time.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
Yep. It's fucking, like this is just

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
it's peak pettiness and it really gets on my libertarian hackles.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.000
I knew this would be the greatest, the great article to start with you.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
So. It just, mmm. The city of

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
Stockholm was unsure about the official platform from the beginning.

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
We do not have open API, so they made their own solution.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
It may be illegal because people's personal data is involved.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
And even though Helen Mossberg, who is the

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
deputy head of digitization and IT at the city's education division,

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
claimed to be generally positive about the app, she still said that

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
a rigorous investigation was being launched.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.000
In mid February, a Swedish security firm completed an external audit

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
of the app and the report was not published.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
And then three weeks later at the end of February, the city said

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
it was making security updates to the Skoll platform to stop any potential personal

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
data from being accessed, effectively shutting down Apna Skoll

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
platform's home brewed API. This began

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
a tug of war between the two sides. The Skoll platform would be updated,

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
Apna Skoll platform would respond with its own updates. In March,

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
Apna Skoll platform was apparently updated seven times to avoid sabotage from

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
the city, which continued to change its underlying systems.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
So it doesn't sound like the city is actually fixing any of the problems with the

29:52.000 --> 29:56.000
app. This has been going for like two years at this point, but when it comes

29:56.000 --> 30:00.000
time to, when it comes time to stop this competitive app,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
they're, they're updating it like crazy.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.000
Well, that's what I mean. They're not trying to, they're doing this

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
out of spite. It's painless. They're doing it. They

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
would rather the app be actively worse to use

30:14.000 --> 30:18.000
as long as a private citizen wasn't the one to make it.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
Yep. Do not pretend to tell me that the

30:22.000 --> 30:26.000
state cares about you. In early April,

30:26.000 --> 30:30.000
the city asked the developers to unpublish their source code from

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
GitHub. On April 15th, the Education Administration

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
announced it had completed its investigation into the parent developed system and had

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
concerns about how the app handled data. The city then reported the developers

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
and Apna Skoll platform into the police, saying that it believed a

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
data breach had occurred. They wrote the police report

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
in a way that was supposed to look scary. That says, says Langdon.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
In the following weeks, Cybercom investigators came to his house and interviewed him about the open source app,

30:58.000 --> 31:02.000
a process that Langdon says caused him to doubt the work the team had done.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.000
You have to make a decision at that point on what you're trying to do. He ultimately

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
decided to keep working on the project along with an expanding team as they believed it was

31:10.000 --> 31:14.000
the right thing to do. As the dispute was unfolding,

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
Apna Skoll platform continued growing in popularity,

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
including a swell the number of people involved in its development. So now

31:22.000 --> 31:26.000
they have 40 people working on this app because it's so popular and apparently it's at least

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
it's at least kind of financially solvent, probably not for all 40 of them, but

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
people want this basically. The volunteers have

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
found and squashed bugs, developed a search feature, and

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
translated the app into different languages. They also raised

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
potential security issues with the official app, even as the city worked against them.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
All right.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
I know you're trying to sue us, I know you're trying to sue us out of

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
existence and possibly get me arrested, but here's why your app is shit.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
Yep. So it seems like

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
in the end, they won

32:06.000 --> 32:10.000
because Apna Skoll platformer had to wait months to be cleared.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
We do not believe anything criminal has been committed,

32:14.000 --> 32:18.000
said the leader of the police's preliminary investigation, and the

32:18.000 --> 32:22.000
data regulator in Sweden did not open an investigation into the city's complaint.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
So it seems like the city lost this one, at least so far.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
Based.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
However,

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
things changed in September. Langdon was traveling to his brother's

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
wedding in France when he got a phone call. The city was changing

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
actually, no, no, this is when it got better. The city was changing its position on

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
Apna Skoll platform and any other app seeking to do similar things and decided to let

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
others access the data within its systems. To do so, the city struck

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
a deal with an external provider that will be able to set up licenses between

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
Apna Skoll platform and the city. So now the city

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
can guarantee that private data is handled in a correct and secure way while

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
parents can take part in the market's digital tools in their everyday lives.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
See, I have a feeling that governments would just generally be better

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
off if they allow this kind of economic activity to happen

33:18.000 --> 33:22.000
and just be like, listen, you can just pay us a cut and we won't fucking bother you.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
Better than like fighting their own populace, you know what I mean?

33:26.000 --> 33:30.000
Well yeah, basically if they

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
allow the populace to get involved in the streamlining of state activity

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
not only will it save them time, it will save them money

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
and it will avoid a lot of the

33:42.000 --> 33:46.000
complications that come with government bureaucracy and inefficiency.

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
Like, here's the thing, I am a pragmatist, I might

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
be an anarcho-capitalist, but if a state is going to exist, I want that state

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
to be as streamlined and efficient and cost-effective as possible.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
So, I think this is ultimately

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
like, as an achievable political goal, this is probably an incredibly

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
good thing. It's something that should be emulated elsewhere.

34:10.000 --> 34:14.000
I mean, at the end of the article Langren says that all

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
officials should make their APIs open source so citizens can build technology

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
that works for them. If you build the API, the app will come. And

34:22.000 --> 34:26.000
I can understand the security complaint. That's reasonable. You don't want

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
people getting a hold of your child's schedule or something. Yeah, fair enough.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
But I also understand the other side of it too, you know?

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
There's a reasonable conversation to have here that isn't just

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
shut it down. To be fair, the original

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
state-built one was doxxing people so

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
they don't really have a leg to stand on on security. That's true. They were

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
also failing at it. But just because they were failing at it, that doesn't mean that it's also not a legitimate

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
question to ask. You know what I mean?

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
Yeah, I suppose. But I'm just saying that

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
being a part of the state apparatus does not

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
exempt you from... That kind of incompetence? Yes.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
Not just that incompetence, but also from being a

35:14.000 --> 35:18.000
security threat yourself. Right, right. So that's pretty much the end of that

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
story. I knew you would enjoy that one. I did,

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
so thank you very much. Okay, what's the next one? Oh!

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
Oh, you guys are going to love this! You guys are going to love this.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
Do you remember Thirsty Sword Lesbians?

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
I don't, but elaborate, please.

35:38.000 --> 35:42.000
I covered it on the show a couple months ago. It was a tabletop RPG

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
rule set that was only for

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
lesbians. If you weren't a lesbian, you couldn't play.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
And of course they have all the things like, fascists can't play this game. You know what I mean, right?

35:54.000 --> 35:58.000
You know what I'm talking about. You know the kind of thing I'm talking about.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
Woke tabletop. Yes.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
So, they have announced their

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
Woke First expansion. They're now

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
kickstarting Advanced Lovers and Lesbians.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.000
Draw your sword and bare your heart with new character types, fresh

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
settings, and even more ways to enjoy Thirsty

36:22.000 --> 36:26.000
Sword Lesbians. This Kickstarter received $97,000.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
How? How? How? Why?

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
Why does this exist? Oh, it makes

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
me angry just looking at it. No, cause look,

36:38.000 --> 36:42.000
why would people waste a hundred grand on something like this?

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
Like...

36:46.000 --> 36:50.000
Look. Okay, let me read it. Let me read it.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.000
Draw your sword and bare your heart with this new print supplement for

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
Thirsty Sword Lesbians. Ten new character playbooks, four adventures, twenty

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
plus settings, and a toolbox full of inspirational mechanics that will take

37:02.000 --> 37:06.000
your game to the next level. And Advanced Lovers and Lesbians.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
Wow. Dude, do you see this image?

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
Can I make it bigger? Hold on.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
That's gross.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.000
That's legitimately gross.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
Looking at it, some of it's

37:26.000 --> 37:30.000
fine. The art isn't bad, but freaking

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
I don't know. A lot of the characters just seem to be drawn

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
to be so deliberately off-putting.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
I don't know what it is. Well, it's made by the company Gay Spaceship

37:42.000 --> 37:46.000
Games, and if I zoom in enough, can you see this?

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
Right there. Actually, hold on. I'll need to pull up.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.000
Just give me a second.

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
Okay. So, the original Thirsty

37:58.000 --> 38:02.000
Sword Lesbians had official artwork

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
of this. And there it is.

38:06.000 --> 38:10.000
And yeah, the characters are pretty ugly. However,

38:10.000 --> 38:14.000
what's interesting is that they are clearly

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
and obviously aping the design of a

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
reasonably obscure 1990s anime

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
called Revolutionary Girl Utena. And I'll show you what I mean.

38:26.000 --> 38:30.000
Nobody fucking watches Revolutionary Girl Utena anymore. That was like

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
made in 96. That's what I'm saying. I've heard of Utena.

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
Right. So, here's Utena.

38:38.000 --> 38:42.000
Hold on. Can I get a better picture than that? Come on, internet.

38:42.000 --> 38:46.000
Okay. Here's Utena.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
It's clearly the same kind of design, but the characters are significantly more

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
appealing. I'm not seeing it, bud. I think you're gonna need to zoom.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
No. Are you sure? Yeah, I think you need to

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
zoom out, bud. Zoom out? This is... Okay, hold on.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
That's just... Yeah. What do you mean? I'm not seeing

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
this picture of Revolutionary Girl Utena. Oh, you're not?

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
I wonder why. Hold on.

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
Why isn't it... No, it's not giving you the...

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
It's only... I think it's only showing one window. Okay, hold on.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
If I did this... Yeah, that's good. Okay, so this is

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
the Thirsty Sword Lesbians box art, okay?

39:30.000 --> 39:34.000
Right. And this is the Utena art.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
Oh, I see. That actually looks good

39:38.000 --> 39:42.000
and appealing. And the thing is, by today's

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
standards, Utena is a reasonably left-leaning anime.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
Like, it wears its feminism on its sleeve. Like, if

39:50.000 --> 39:54.000
you wanted to point out what is a feminist anime, it would be this show.

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
For sure. However... However, it's still

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
actually very good because the characters are well developed and there's like an actual full story arc and they go

40:02.000 --> 40:06.000
through troubles. The main hero loses fights and has to come back. Like, it's

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
not just all Mary Sue bullshit. It's... You can have

40:10.000 --> 40:14.000
good feminist or even socialist or any

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
brand of left-leaning storytelling. You can still have that

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
but I think there's a reason we haven't seen it in about 20 years.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
Well, let's take something like...

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
Let's take something a lot more Western and live-action like Law & Order, for example.

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
If you listen to any political discussion on the show, Law & Order,

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
the side that always wins out is

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
always left-leaning. It's always the

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
sort of bog-standard Democrat position because

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
it's set in New York.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
But the show is still good in spite of

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
that because it's well-written.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
It just seems to be rare nowadays to have things that are well-written.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.000
It doesn't exist anymore.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
In any case... I think

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
all the creative talent of the 21st century was just

41:14.000 --> 41:18.000
poured into the Lord of the Rings movies and now we're having to say it through

41:18.000 --> 41:22.000
a 100-year darkness of no talent just

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
because it was all went into those movies.

41:26.000 --> 41:30.000
Are you eating something? I kind of hear. Are you chowing down?

41:30.000 --> 41:34.000
Not really. Oh, are you drinking? Do you have a slurp for us?

41:34.000 --> 41:38.000
Yeah, I'm chugging.

41:38.000 --> 41:42.000
Okay, that's what it is.

41:42.000 --> 41:46.000
This is coming out if you're interested.

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
I keep bothering Arch and Sargon to say, listen, we have to play a game

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
of Thirsty Sword Lesbians. We have to play a game of this shit.

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
It would be fucking hilarious. See, here's the thing though. Arch would

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
probably go for it. Sargon, I know he's busy these days, but I think

42:02.000 --> 42:06.000
if Sargon got a spare five minutes, I'm sure he'd be down for it.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
Actually, Arch is the one who said no, he did not want to play

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
Thirsty Sword Lesbians.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
Well, to be fair, he's very serious about his tabletop.

42:18.000 --> 42:22.000
Right, right. Okay, let's go on to the next thing I've got here.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.000
Andrew Garfield talks Spiderman.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
Money is the thing that has corrupted all of us and led to the terrible

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
ecological collapse that we are all about to die under.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
Shut the fuck up, Spiderman. How is this about Spiderman?

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
Like,

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
I didn't realize Spiderman was a socialist.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
An eco-socialist at that.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
I just don't understand. He's asked about

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
his newest, because he's in the newest Spiderman movie.

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
Hey, Mr. Andrew Garfield, how do you feel about your new Spiderman movie?

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
And this is what he gives us as an answer. What the fuck?

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
They almost feel like automatons at this point.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
No matter what question you give them, it has to relate to

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
to woke talking points.

43:18.000 --> 43:22.000
And to the point where it's so ingrained in their head that they just can't deviate from it anymore.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
I don't know.

43:26.000 --> 43:30.000
I almost feel sorry for them for how NPC they have become.

43:30.000 --> 43:34.000
Let's see what he actually said. Oh, this is why he spoke to the

43:34.000 --> 43:38.000
Guardian. Okay. So speaking to the Guardian, Andrew Garfield briefly

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
touched upon his time playing Peter Parker

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
in Sony's second cinematic take on the Marvel character for The Amazing Spider-Man

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
and its sequel. Relieved to not have to dance around being asked whether or not he'd be back for the

43:50.000 --> 43:54.000
third reboot at the studio, Garfield seemingly relished in the frank honesty

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
of what it was like to be catapulted into a character as monumental

43:58.000 --> 44:02.000
as Peter Parker.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
There were millions of dollars at stake and that's what guides the ship. It was a big awakening

44:16.000 --> 44:20.000
and it hurt.

44:20.000 --> 44:24.000
So he's whinging about that movies cost money

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
and they are expected to do well. And that he got

44:28.000 --> 44:32.000
paid.

44:32.000 --> 44:36.000
Grow the fuck up you man child. He says

44:36.000 --> 44:40.000
Comic-Con in San Diego is full of grown men and women still

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
in touch with that pure thing the character meant to them. But you add

44:44.000 --> 44:48.000
in market forces and test groups and suddenly the focus is less

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
on the soul of it and more on ensuring we make as much money as possible.

44:52.000 --> 44:56.000
And I find that heartbreaking

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
in all matters of culture. Money is the thing that has corrupted all of us

45:00.000 --> 45:04.000
and led to the terrible ecological collapse that we are all about to die

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
under. It's like holy fuck. Dude, I think you'll be fine living in Hollywood.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
Actually no, that's probably going to go underwater. But you'll have enough money to leave. Don't worry about it.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
This almost sounds like, I don't know

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
it almost sounds like he's a child who

45:20.000 --> 45:24.000
watched Spider-Man, thought Spider-Man was real but then

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
went to watch the movie being filmed and realised it's all fake.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.000
Yes. Now he has a point. There's definitely

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
been a trend of just soulless cash-ins

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
on behalf of Disney and Marvel and Star Wars.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
You know, there's been some really shitty movies that are clearly just there

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
to swindle fans and run away. That happens.

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
Don't get me wrong, those exist and in fact a large

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
proportion of the comic-skate

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
or whatever is whinging. I say whinging. That's being a bit unfair.

46:00.000 --> 46:04.000
But it's complaining about that.

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
Yeah, but he then links it to the terrible ecological

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
collapse that we're all about to die under.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
Man. Okay Lefty Doomer.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
Yeah, like, again, just like the vaccine

46:20.000 --> 46:24.000
conversation earlier. I'm not going to be one of those people who is like climate change doesn't exist.

46:24.000 --> 46:28.000
It does exist. But like, I think it'll be fine, dude.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
You know, I think human ingenuity will

46:32.000 --> 46:36.000
invent some cool new thing that will solve whatever problems that we have

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
and it'll be okay. We are not going to, like, the planet's

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
not going to turn into a bowl of molten lava. It'll be okay, guys.

46:44.000 --> 46:48.000
Like, stop thinking like you're going to be living in fucking fallout.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
It's fine. We're not going down that road.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
The two big problems with climate change are cutting down trees

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
and plastic in the ocean. Those are the two big ones. Yes.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
Now, plastic in the ocean is already being solved

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
by market forces as we speak. There are already been technologies

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
developed to eat, like, micro technologies being developed to eat plastic.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.000
And second of all,

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
the trees, we've had methods of sustainable

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
tree growth since the Roman Empire.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.000
Like, this isn't new information.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
It's not some big revelation on how to cut

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
down trees without killing them. The problem

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
is that China and Russia, and to a lesser extent India, don't care.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
And when you have those three, like, America and Canada and the UK

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
and Europe can do whatever it wants, but if you have

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
those guys not giving a shit, you're not going to solve the problem. You can't point

47:52.000 --> 47:56.000
the fingers at us.

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
Well, ultimately, India

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
I think it's just a case of they're still in their industrialization phase.

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
So, they will come round over time.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
Russia will need a regime change, but I think that's something that will occur naturally

48:12.000 --> 48:16.000
because they're not a totalitarian regime.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
They're more of an oligarchy. Authoritarian, certainly, but not totalitarian.

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
And China

48:24.000 --> 48:28.000
I don't think China will last the next 50 years.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
Yeah, China will destroy itself at this rate. Everyone's like, China, you gotta confront China. Well, yeah,

48:32.000 --> 48:36.000
we do gotta confront China, but also, China's already on a downhill path

48:36.000 --> 48:40.000
of its own making, you know?

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
Whenever someone says, oh, a country's gonna take over

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
America as the next big,

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
the next number one economy, there always seems to be

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
some underlying thing that people are ignoring.

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
Like, with Japan, it was the fact that

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
Japan, it was the fact that

49:04.000 --> 49:08.000
in order to fuel their economic prosperity in the 80s, they were taking on huge

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
amounts of death.

49:12.000 --> 49:16.000
And in China, it's the fact that their entire

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
economy is based on being the factory of the world, and if that

49:20.000 --> 49:24.000
gets taken away, they'll just collapse under their own weight.

49:24.000 --> 49:28.000
Right.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
I guess it's time to go onto the next article, because I don't think there's anything more worthwhile than this.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
It's long, and it's really fucking stupid.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.000
So it's just him whinging? Okay, fair enough.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
I forget what this one is. What is this? Oh, yeah. Check this out.

49:44.000 --> 49:48.000
This is on a subreddit about trans pets.

49:48.000 --> 49:52.000
Okay. My male dog doesn't

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
lift his leg to pee. Is he trans?

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
My dog has already hit the two years of age mark and still pee is like a

50:00.000 --> 50:04.000
female or a pup. Should I make an appointment with a trans-friendly

50:04.000 --> 50:08.000
vet for gender reassignment?

50:08.000 --> 50:12.000
Right. Let me make one

50:12.000 --> 50:16.000
thing abundantly clear.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
You cannot have a trans dog.

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
Trans is a very specific, being trans

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
is caused by a very specific mental state that is exclusive, as far as we know,

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
to humans.

50:32.000 --> 50:36.000
Hold on. You cannot have a trans dog.

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
Okay, you're gonna like this one. Yeah, this is r slash

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
trans pets. Oh, just kill me. Kill me.

50:44.000 --> 50:48.000
How to stop my cat from being aggressive while

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
dilating. So my cat

50:52.000 --> 50:56.000
Julie had her gender reassignment surgery three

50:56.000 --> 51:00.000
days ago. The surgeon said that her neo-vagina

51:00.000 --> 51:04.000
needs to be dilated three times a day, ten minutes each.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
But she isn't liking it. How can I help her? My

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
hands are full of wounds because of her claws and teeth. I wanted to get

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
her declawed, but claws or nails are an essential part of

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
being a woman or a female cat. So

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
So you've cut a male cat's bollocks off

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
and now you're pouring fucking fluids onto its wound

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
and you're expecting it not to hurt?

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
It's not just that. The surgeon built a cat

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
neo-vagina that needs to be dilated with like

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
what do they use? It's kind of like a

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
it's like a rod that holds the wound open.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
Yeah, I know, but what I'm saying is that something tells me

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
that this is not a veterinarian's association

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
approved. Probably not. So it's very

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
likely that that wound really fucking hurts for that cat.

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
Yes. I'm hoping this is like a troll sub.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
Like holy fuck. No, I see, I

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
really hope as well because as funny as it is, at the same time

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
this boils my piss because I really hate, like

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
needless to say I hate animal abuse, but I really hate animal abuse.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
Okay, this one. Alright.

52:32.000 --> 52:36.000
Are you guys ready for the latest TikTok dance?

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
You're not going to be able to hear it, okay?

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
So I'll post it in the chat.

52:44.000 --> 52:48.000
Here it is. And you can pull it up yourself.

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
And then on three we'll play it, okay?

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
Okay. One, two, three.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
I'm dreaming

53:00.000 --> 53:04.000
of a mass Christmas

53:04.000 --> 53:08.000
Pick that shit up over your nose

53:08.000 --> 53:12.000
You can't even sing!

53:12.000 --> 53:16.000
Where the anti-masker is all set And there's

53:16.000 --> 53:20.000
a political division

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
To get our Covid count so low

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
Oh to know

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
I'm dreaming of a mass Christmas

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
Pick that shit up over your nose

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
I'm dreaming of a mass Christmas

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
Don't wanna see no chin diapers in here

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
Seriously, on the mouth and the nose. Or get out!

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
Come on! It's not that hard.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
That's it.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.000
Oh god. I would like to say a couple of things.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
Oh okay. Sorry.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
Which is good because it wouldn't play on my end.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
Second of all, that's ruined

54:12.000 --> 54:16.000
my day. Thank you.

54:16.000 --> 54:20.000
I love Christmas and that has

54:20.000 --> 54:24.000
thoroughly corrupted the image of Christmas.

54:24.000 --> 54:28.000
I am proud to say I have only worn a mask

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
once and I found it reasonable when I did because I was going into a hospital.

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
And it's like okay yeah fair enough you know. Honestly we probably should have been doing that before

54:36.000 --> 54:40.000
the pandemic anyway. It's a hospital. It's a different situation. But I don't

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
wear them to go to stores or anything. I certainly don't wear them just walking inside my house.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
Fuck that. Fuck all the Covid theatre.

54:48.000 --> 54:52.000
Fuck it. I have never.

54:52.000 --> 54:56.000
Right. It is a legal requirement in our country to wear them on the bus.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
Which is only recent. That only came in a couple of weeks ago.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
It is

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
technically legal to wear it. It is technically.

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
You do technically have to wear it in certain venues but nobody enforces it.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
Because people are sick to death.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
And

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
I only wear it at work because it's a legal part

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
of my requirement at work because I work

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
in an industry tangentially related to the NHS.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
See here it kind of exists in a grey area

55:36.000 --> 55:40.000
because it makes sense to me that if a store owner wants you

55:40.000 --> 55:44.000
to wear a mask in their shop they can tell you to leave if you don't. It's their property. It's their right.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
It's their business. It's their house. You got to do what they say. Fair enough.

55:48.000 --> 55:52.000
But like the government will not arrest

55:52.000 --> 55:56.000
you if you don't wear a mask in a store. But they

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
sometimes find the store for not telling you to do so.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
But the store is not empowered to make you do so.

56:04.000 --> 56:08.000
It's like no one wants to actually be holding the potato.

56:08.000 --> 56:12.000
The hot potato responsibility on this. So they've left it as

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
vague as possible. You know what I mean?

56:16.000 --> 56:20.000
Mitch for $2.65. Thank you very much.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
Physically remove those mask speakers and animal

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
trunes so to speak.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
Hopper posting in my

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
fucking chat.

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
We're not going to read these articles but I just wanted to go over the juxtaposition here.

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
They're both from the same thing. They're both from Yahoo. You got

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
Joe Rogan who's not a doctor gives terrible vaccine

56:48.000 --> 56:52.000
advice. There's the headline.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.000
Oops I accidentally clicked off of it like an idiot. Okay. Joe Rogan who's not

56:56.000 --> 57:00.000
a doctor gives terrible vaccine advice. Podcaster Joe Rogan who has no public health

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
expertise told his listeners that

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
healthy young adults have no need to get a vaccine.

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
That's probably kind of true. However, the headline

57:12.000 --> 57:16.000
and the way that they're framing this is like

57:16.000 --> 57:20.000
they had to put in who's not a doctor. Okay. So also from Yahoo

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
you have five things Bill Gates wants you to

57:24.000 --> 57:28.000
know about COVID-19 variants. Couldn't you say

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
five things Bill Gates who's not a doctor? Like there's

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
obvious bias here. Here's the thing.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
Joe Rogan is a podcaster. Bill Gates is their lord and master.

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
He is one of the

57:44.000 --> 57:48.000
leaders in what the certain right British right wing

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
YouTube circles would call the managerial elite.

57:52.000 --> 57:56.000
Yes. So have you seen that picture of Bill Gates drinking shit water?

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
No. Okay. So a few years ago

58:00.000 --> 58:04.000
Bill Gates was heavily promoting a machine that turned shit into

58:04.000 --> 58:08.000
drinkable water and the water looked completely fine.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
It was probably like when it comes down to the actual molecules involved, it probably was

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
just regular water, but he takes it and he takes a big swig of it and he's like, that's delicious.

58:16.000 --> 58:20.000
And it's like, holy fuck dude.

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
It's like at best it's water. It's not delicious. It's just

58:24.000 --> 58:28.000
water. Yes. At worst, at worst you're actively trying

58:28.000 --> 58:32.000
to deceive people into drinking shit tasting water.

58:32.000 --> 58:36.000
Yep. Okay. What is this?

58:36.000 --> 58:40.000
Oh God, this is from UndeadScribe. What did Poe send me

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
today? Oh yeah, this. Okay. This is a

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
trans person who's Japanese. Does anyone want my own

58:48.000 --> 58:52.000
egg wine? It's about 100 milliliters.

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
Only wine, but not the eggs. Okay. This person cut off

58:56.000 --> 59:00.000
their own testicles and then fermented

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
those testicles and made wine out of it.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
Oh.

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
Look, I'm all for trans

59:12.000 --> 59:16.000
rights, right? Oh, I know. I know how much you're into them, buddy.

59:16.000 --> 59:20.000
I'm all for trans rights, but at the same time, can some

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
of you just stop being such fucking degenerates, please?

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
Like, can you just, like, I feel like the mother

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
in the car in the Babadook. Just, why can't you just be

59:32.000 --> 59:36.000
normal?

59:36.000 --> 59:40.000
Oh God, like you got like women who like cook with their period

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
blood or they like, they make like vagina yeast bread

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
or whatever the fuck. It all like, why the fuck are people doing this?

59:48.000 --> 59:52.000
Why? Because they're not okay.

59:52.000 --> 59:56.000
Like gender dysphoria is the least of their worries.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Man, and you know what, like this is not

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
a phenomenon. It's like, it's not exclusive

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
to these types of people. Now we've seen a lot of it from these types of people in the past,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
in the past decade or so, but I recall when I was growing up hearing

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
about, and this is out of more traditional communities, about

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
women who would eat placentas and I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Who? Why? Who the fuck wants to eat a childbirth placenta?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
And it's like, well, it's just, it's like a natural thing, dude. It's like, shut the fuck up.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I don't want to, I don't want to do any of this.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
It all just sounds awful.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Oh, hold on a second. I think my headphones just died. Uh oh.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Hey, are you still there?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Yeah, I'm still here.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Okay, they came back. I can hear you. Great. Alright.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
When recycling goes wrong. Oh, okay. Hold on.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
In the chat, Millie, the weekly sip is a lot better without the Minecraft server BS.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I advertise the server at the start of the sip for like 30 seconds.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Does that bother you that much? Alright.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Okay. Minecraften. Yes.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Only surveillance can save us from the coronavirus.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
You must have seen this, this headline around, right?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Big data. Oh, yes.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Look, here's, here's all I'm going to say.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Anyone who supports this, if the revolution

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.000
does end up happening, if the boogaloo comes along,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I will not mourn your death.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Okay, so.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Only surveillance can save us from coronavirus. Big data

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000
offers tools to stop the pandemic right now if we change our definition

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
of privacy. Look at this, look at this

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
fucking guy's phone. What is this, 16 different

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
COVID apps? One of them is called coronavirus sus.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Fuck. Okay. In those parts of the world

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:16.000
under lockdown, people have discovered a renewed appreciation for the internet

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
and the resources it offers. Books, movies, music, endless

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000
news content, and the tools to communicate with friends and family.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Imagine the lockdown without the internet. It's not a comforting thought, but that would just be like

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000
renting games from, you know, the local Blockbuster or whatever and just

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
staying inside. So.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
To be honest, that's, that's, that's making me a tad nostalgic. I could go for that right now.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Yeah. Fucking. Yeah. Fucking get, get some

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
pizza, some ice cream, play some GameCube or something.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Oh, it takes me back. To be fair, it was N64 for me. I'm a little

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.000
bit older. N64 was my big rental time.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
My, um, I rented a lot when I was young because by the time I got to my teenage

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000
years, Blockbuster had largely died out. Yep. But

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
it was GameCube for me because again, I was a bit younger

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
than when you rented, but also I didn't really have a choice

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
because renting would largely died out by the early 2010s.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
This is a shame, man, because now, now you just got to pay like

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
fucking $90 in Canadian money to get a new game. Fuck.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Here's the thing. It's also the fact that

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:32.000
like, not to get us too far off topic, but also like

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.000
it's the fact that it's largely been replaced by stuff like Xbox Game Pass

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
and yeah, Game Pass is, Game Pass is worth it on the face of it

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.000
but also at the same time it's like renting

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
like renting was good because it was specific. You could go

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
and rent the specific game that you wanted. You weren't just

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
getting like, paying a monthly fee to like get like a

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
different selection of games filtered in and out every month. Yep.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It's a possibility that none of them interest you.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Yeah, when I was growing up it was $3 a night.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
So you get a game, you have it for a full 24 hour period. Cost 3 bucks.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
6 bucks if you go for the whole weekend.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Stay up all night, eat some sweets, eat some pizza,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
complete the game overnight, take it back the next day.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Yep. Yep. Alright, so

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
let's go through here.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
The internet's system of surveillance has been perfected beyond

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
our imaginations and usually beyond our acknowledgement. It now extends

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
over email, social media, credit card payments, cell phone use, and

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
travel records. Every flight and hotel booking, every payment and bank

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
transfer, every call, every picture can be brought together in a single

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.000
platform and mined for interesting or unusual patterns.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Yet, while extending in every direction and the system was completely

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
powerless to warn us about the coronavirus, let's fight it. That is about to change

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
and our concept of personal privacy will have to change with it.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
That sounds fucking awful and fuck you.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000
No, it's not happening. I will

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
throw away my phone and I will

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
throw away my phone and I will give up technology before I allow

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
the state to track me using my

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
devices. I will go offline before

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:36.000
that happens. I have a Galaxy S2.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Any of you remember that phone? The Galaxy S2?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
What is it? 2010? Yeah.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And the reason I haven't just mindlessly updated is because

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
it still works. I don't use data or anything

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
when I'm out. Here's what I use my phone for. I occasionally call my parents

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
and I occasionally text some people and that's it. I never use data.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I never really use its other features. Oh yeah, I have like

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
an exercise app on it that I only occasionally use because I'm fat. But the point is

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
I don't need a super powerful phone.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
And also, I'm not even sure if my phone would work with a coronavirus

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
scanning app that's currently being enforced in Ontario.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
So, like, my

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Facebook, I have one picture on my Facebook because they require

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
you to have an avatar. And the picture is of Dr. Robotnik's

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000
face. And it's been the same picture since 2008.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Like, I work on the internet.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I have the YouTube channel and I stream on Twitch and all this stuff.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
But when it comes to me personally, I live a very low tech life.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
And I kind of prefer it that way. I kind of prefer it that way.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Short-Fighter Taku is very tech-savvy, but

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Devin, he's not

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
He is a good,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Mormon boy. Not Mormon, Amish boy.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
He's a good Amish boy.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
He is a good Amish boy and he does no wrong. It's funny because

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
like, I'd say most of the time I go out

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000
of the house without my phone. Like, if I want to listen to music, sometimes I'll bring it. But I also

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
have like an old MP3 player from like 2006. It still works. So it's like, whatever. I don't care.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
But the point being is that

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
my parents who are boomers, they're, they're older than me.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
They, they chastise me every time I

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
leave the house without my phone, because sometimes they'll call me. I'm not there. Like, where were you?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Oh, I didn't have my phone when I went out. Like, why don't you have your phone with you when you go out? And it's like, well

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
fucking, you spent most of your life without doing that shit.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Why does it matter now?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I never needed it. Yes. I hardly ever need it. Like fucking leave me alone.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Yeah. And I, I, I like

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
the occasional feeling of, because I live like 10 minutes away from a forest,

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I like the occasional feeling of just going into the woods and being disconnected from everybody else

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
and just kind of having an hour or two to myself, you know,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Naomi and I will go for a walk, you know, it just no, no,

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
no connections. You don't need to be connected or jacked in all the fucking time.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Oh, I know that feeling. I grew up in an area of the

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.000
South of England called the New Forest in Hampshire and

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.000
literally having the forest on your doorstep, it's such a blessing.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
It really is. People don't understand how big and how wild Canada

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
truly is. Like there is, unless you're in like

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Vancouver or Halifax or Montreal or Toronto or Ottawa,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
if you're anywhere else or Calgary. Yeah. If you're anywhere else

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.000
you are an hour's worth of forest

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
away from anything else outside of your town. It is, this is a

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
wild, isolated country. There's just tons of mountains, tons

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
of forests, tons of rivers and lakes. Like there is no,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
there is no, most Canadians live in a

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000
place where they can just go off the grid in about 15 minutes. It's quite nice.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Before, um, before the 20th

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
century fricking Canada was basically just IRL Skyrim.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Yeah, pretty much. There's like nobody fucking here, man. Like,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000
okay. People talk about native civilizations and, you know, they

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
weren't as primitive as people said, especially if you get down to like Central America, they

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000
had like empires and they had feudal systems and stuff. So it's okay. Fair enough. But like

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000
the natives that lived here before Europeans showed up, they

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
like they, they, they only barely existed

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.000
because it was so fucking hard to live here. It was so cold.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
So even, even now that that's reflected, like if you're

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
outside of a big city, like there, there's, there's some truly

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
off the grid areas here. It's, it's, it's actually nice. It's quite nice.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Indeed. So yeah, we can move on

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
because like this is just a bunch of stuff. Oh, oh, we want

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
to pay for your bullshit. Fuck you. Right. Before we do that,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I'm going to read some super chats. Oh, okay. Um, because

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.000
because we've got quite a few while we're talking. Oh shit. I don't

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
want, I don't want people to feel neglected.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Um, uh, $1 from Mitch, just saying trune

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
and

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
and Mr. Personality for $14.88. Don't think

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
I don't know what you're doing when you write that. Um, cannibalism

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
with extra steps. I'm not sure what that's in context

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
too, but okay. Neither do I. What did we talk about

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
previously? Oh, the, uh, the testicle wine.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Oh, right. Okay. Yeah. Pretty much. Listen, listen, would you drink

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
the testicle wine? Um, how much

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
would you be willing to pay me to do it? What if it was from a hot trap?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Still, how much would you pay?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
The hotness, the hotness of the trap is irrelevant.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
It's still bollocks in it. It's still fermented bollocks.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Oh, wait, hold on. Does, does bollocks mean

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
mean balls? Yeah. Oh, I always thought it meant

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
thought it meant ass cheeks. No, it's why you get, it's getting kicked

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000
in the bollocks. It means getting kicked in the balls. Oh, okay. No, no.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:40.000
See, I don't really know British slang. I always thought it meant your butt. No,

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000
it's, it's, it's your, it's your balls. Oh, okay. All right.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000
It's like the, how hot the trap is, is

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.000
immaterial to the fact that it's still fermented bollocks.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Right. Shall we move on? There's a guy in the chat who said he's

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
from Thunder Bay. I went, I went to school in Thunder Bay. I went to university there.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
What a, what a fucking isolated, oh my

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
God, what an isolated shithole Thunder Bay is. Okay. Thunder Bay

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
is a reasonably big city and it's surrounded by like six

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
hours of forest in all directions. There's nothing there.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
It's just wild wilderness. It's man. And also

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Is this why, is this why when you and your friend, when you and Dave, I was about to say

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000
your friend, I don't know his name.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Is this why you and Dave, whenever you talk about your hometown,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
you talk about it like it's like some middle, like some like

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
middle America buttfuck nowhere town because it actually is. It actually

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
is. Yes. And also, unfortunately, it's been overrun by

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
heroin since we moved away. It is not the idyllic place it was when we grew up.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
It's a shame.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Is that because of like deindustrialization?

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Actually, no, because the towns, it's one of those single industry

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.000
towns, but that industry hasn't died. It's forestry. Like there's no mines to be shut down.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
There's no factories to be shut down. It's a paper mill.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
And so that, it's been going now and it's probably going to keep going for a long time

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
because Canada has tons of trees. But no, it's just

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
that like a lot of people who

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000
couldn't leave and couldn't get jobs at the mill because it's really the only place

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
you can work in the town, they just ended up getting on drugs because they couldn't, they didn't

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
have anything else.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Is it a case of like

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
a scarcity of like jobs in the town? Yes, yeah.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
All right. Yeah. And yeah, you can walk out into the forest in the summer

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000
and just find random junkies living in the woods.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Oh. Yes, I went to Lakehead University. I went to Lakehead University.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000
I got, you know what? I got my minor in gender studies

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
at Lakehead University. Yeah, you've mentioned that on the stream

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000
before. That's how I know about a lot of this shit. I still have

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000
my old textbooks. Okay, so I have like 40

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
minutes, right? We should probably get through these articles. Yeah. All right, what's this?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Blaine police investigating after Instacart

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000
shopper allegedly drives over an elderly couple's groceries.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Jesus.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Why would you do that?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Why would you drive over, like if you, if you work for Instacart and you buy an elderly

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
couple's groceries, why would you drive over it after, let's

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:44.000
see. An Instacart shopper drove over their groceries last week

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
possibly in response to a pro law enforcement sign

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
in their front yard. Oh, so they had like a

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
like a blue lives matter, like a thin blue line kind of sign in their front yard. So this person

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
delivers their groceries and destroys them. Wow. Okay.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Yeah.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
It's just like, oh yeah, that's totally a way, like it's not

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000
even necessarily, it's not even necessarily about conducting yourself or having a

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:16.000
anti-cop opinion that winds me up. It's just like, this is only going to be detrimental

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000
to you in the long run. Like yeah, you destroyed their groceries so they can buy you.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000
They can buy you more. Is it worth really losing your job over?

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Yeah, so according to a news

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
release, the couple had placed an order for delivery on the morning of December 6th.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Once the driver arrived at their home,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:40.000
the couple went outside to meet the driver. The driver yelled from the check the inside of

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
their Christmas wreath where they found a receipt with a derogatory message written on it.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000
It says that Instacart doesn't pay their employees, find another

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.000
slave, fuck the police, racist pigs,

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.000
and the groceries themselves were destroyed

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.000
and left in the driveway. Oh my god.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Wow. Wait, so this wasn't even because

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000
of them? No, it was, it's just that

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.000
this person who works for Instacart just didn't care.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
They feel like they're not getting paid enough and they saw the

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
thin blue line sign in their front yard, so they destroyed the groceries

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.000
and wrote on their Christmas wreath. And they wrote

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
find another slave, fuck the police, racist pigs, and it's like Jesus.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Oh my god.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Wow. So they've

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:40.000
identified the worker, a 36 year old from Coon Rapids,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
and that charges are in the near future. She is not cooperating with us, if you can

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
believe that. They're going to add disorderly conduct charges

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
and criminal damage to property. And a GoFundMe

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.000
has been raising $7,000 for the old couple, so that's nice.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Oh, that's nice. I like that.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
You know what? This is actually missing a part of the story. This is a different article than the one that

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
I had planned to show, so just give me a second. Give me just a moment, okay?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000
Listen to those taps.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Those clickety-clacks. Here it is. Alright.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Found it. Because part

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
of the article was supposed to talk about who

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
the person was, who this 36 year old driver was for Instacart.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
But it wasn't in there. So I just quickly found it. And here's what it is.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000
If you can see it. Milliwig in chat is asking what's

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Instacart before we move on. Instacart is a, do you know what Instacart is?

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
No. Oh really? Okay. So Instacart is a company

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
that you, there's an app and you

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000
put in your grocery list on the app. And they have workers who

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
will go out to a store and buy the food

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.000
and then deliver it to you. And then they charge you for the delivery and they charge you for the food.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.000
So the idea is if you can't leave your house but you have to go grocery shopping

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
you can get an Instacart order.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Oh no, a lot. We don't have anything like that mainly because

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:20.000
oh we do actually have something like that. It's called Ocado.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:24.000
And we

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
mostly don't have any competitors to Ocado

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
mainly because most grocery stores

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
have their own delivery services. Right. Direct to your door.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
That's not common here. So apps have kind of filled the void. And we also have

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
similar ones for food delivery like Grubhub and stuff like that. Where if you want to have food

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000
from a restaurant that doesn't deliver delivered to you, you can go to

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.000
there's SkipTheDishes, I think that's Canadian only, there's Grubhub

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
and what's the other one? Shit. Uber Eats is one of them.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
There's one more at least. We have Uber Eats and Just Eat.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Those are the two big ones here. Right. Right. Okay. So Instacart

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000
is just a grocery delivery service basically. But here we go. Find another slave

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.000
fuck, find another slave racist, fuck the police pigs

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000
and here's the person.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
This individual with purple hair named Tara. How very

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000
surprising. Yeah.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I wonder if she might have a political slant.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
There might be a reason why she destroyed this elderly couple's groceries.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Possibly tell. In any case, she's

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
facing a 90 day jail sentence in fines.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
Good fucker. I'm good fuck. Yep.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Okay. So what's this? Oh, check this out. You're going to like this.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Okay. Listen, listen, listen to this, okay?

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
A 10 year old boy steals parent's car to visit his grandparents

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000
who are 68 miles away. And then he tells the

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
police he's a dwarf who has forgotten his license.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Absolute madman. He drove his parent's car into a

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000
snowy ditch and he said that he was a dwarf. He just forgot his license.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
He drove more than 10 kilometers for veering

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
off the road where he was found by a snow plow driver who alerted the police.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
The parents had woke up, discovered that their children was missing

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
and somebody had taken off with their car. They were pretty upset. The boy told the snow plow

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
driver that he was a dwarf and he had forgotten his driver's license at home.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
And it turns out the child wasn't injured and the car wasn't damaged and they decided not

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.000
to file charges. Um, so I

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
guess that's a good end, but wow.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Here's the thing though, getting 10 kilometers away with no driving

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
experience at 10 years old, that's pretty impressive.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Yeah. Is this in Canada?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000
No, this is in Norway. Oh, Norway.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I was just going to say, Canada, Norway, it's still like icy as fuck.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
That's even more impressive.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Imagine having the balls to say, oh yeah, I'm just a dwarf.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Did he pass the speech check? No, I don't think he did.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000
I do not think he did.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Go ahead, go ahead.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000
I was going to say he had a 70, he needed a 75 for the speech check.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
This one is actually a much more serious one.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Jesus. That fucking, that headline is like a roller coaster.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Holy shit.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
One, I obviously, I don't feel bad for the

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.000
boyfriend cause the boyfriend's clearly got anger issues.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000
If that's, if he blew up that badly, um,

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
I don't think he did.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I don't think he did.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Um, yeah, discovering your wife's having an affair

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000
is horrible, but still, um,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000
furthermore, like,

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
I don't really feel sympathy for her too much because she's a nonce.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Um,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
the only person I feel really sorry for is the 50 year old boy

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
cause one, he got beaten the shit off by a fully grown cage fighter.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
And also because he got taken advantage of by a nonce.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000
So, you know, what's interesting here is that in Canada, nonce means idiot.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
It doesn't mean pedophile.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Nonce here means pedo.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:48.000
That was the source of a lot of confusion for a long time when I was talking to British people.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000
You're just like, why would you want to kill idiots?

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
I mean, there's a good reason sometimes.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:00.000
But you know what I mean though? Like it was, it was strange to hear.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000
It's just like, oh no, it, nonces are unforgivable. It's just like,

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
you can forgive people for being stupid.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000
All right, so let's see here. Um, jealous ex-convict

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Paul Robson, who was 50, carried out a vicious

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.000
attack against Caroline Kale, 47, and her teenage lover

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000
after he snooped and prowled outside of her home.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.000
This is in the UK.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Yeah, no, it wasn't New Crassle Crown Court. This is around where I live.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:36.000
It says

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Linton, Northumberland.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Hold on, Linton. Give me a second. I'm gonna

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.000
switch over to the live screen for a second.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
People won't be able to see the feed, but.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Northumberland.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Linton, Northumberland. Linton, Northumberland

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
map.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
How close is that to you?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
That's

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
literally within, hold on, I'll do the directions on

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Google Maps. From my exact location,

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
it's about a 30 minute drive. Oh jeez, that's not far at all.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
No, it's about a 30 minute drive.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.000
You could probably get to where they are from me on public transport.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Oh jeez. So, let's see what happened.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Robson may have stamped and kicked on her, leaving her with unsurvivable

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:44.000
brain injuries, chopped off her hair in clumps, cut up her

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
clothes and slashed her buttocks. Injuries to her eyes and

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.000
neck bruising indicated she may have been strangled. He also

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000
attacked the boy with scissors and a meat cleaver, sprayed

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.000
them both with ammonia and stole their phones, later updating

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
her social media pretending to be her while he was on the

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000
run. Holy fuck. This guy's

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
crazy. Yeah, this dude is insane. This makes me

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
even more surprised that she did this, cause he's insane.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
She must have known he was insane. So why would she

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
cheat, and furthermore, why would she cheat while being

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.000
a nonce at the same time?

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
This makes me think that she must have been, like, either

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.000
she had no regard for her own well-being, or her

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
urges to nonce were that strong that they overrode her self-preservation.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Cause something tells

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000
me, for that kind of blow up, she had to have known he was

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
like, violent. Okay, hold on, there's something strange here.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Robson and Mrs. Kale, who were separated from her

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
prison officer husband, had lived together in Linton, but split up weeks

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
before the murder, and he found out she had started a relationship with the boy. It almost

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:08.000
sounds like she didn't cheat on him, she just started fucking the boy

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:12.000
after they broke up. Oh, okay.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Possibly, I don't know what the timeline is, but what the fuck?

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
But she sounds like a real piece of work herself, not

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
again, I'm not condoning what he did. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I know, I agree.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Well fucking, she cheats on her prison officer

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.000
boyfriend with him, then she breaks up with

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:36.000
him and starts noncing with a 15 year old boy, and then he comes

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
in and just goes ham on her.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Absolute fucking, what a shit show this entire story is.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Yeah, man. Oh god.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
I'm trying to, this is

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
all stuff that I've already read, I'm trying to find

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000
details of where the kid comes involved, and it's just, nope, she was just

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.000
fucking a kid. Alright, there's no

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
like extra story with him, it's just, she was

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
fucking a child, and he decided to go crazy and kill her. Wow.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
What a fucking story. I know she's dead, but

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
surely they should probably give more emphasis on the fact that

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
what she was doing herself was incredibly illegal and immoral.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.000
The article actually doesn't, like it mentions the fact that it's an underage

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.000
boy, but doesn't really play it up. I'm surprised, like

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000
apparently, I guess he was just so violent, that's what the whole entire article is about.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Holy shit.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
I just can't help but feel that they're trying to make me sympathize for someone

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
who I really feel no sympathy for at all.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Possibly, yes. Alright, let's continue.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Okay, here we go. I'm skipping this one, I'm gonna use this one for something else, I'm skipping this one.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
90 day Beyonce star.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.000
I make $50,000 a week selling my farts in a jar.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I mean, we've all got to make a living somehow.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
A reality TV star is making waves on social

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.000
media after letting it rip, after letting it rip

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:28.000
that she makes more than $50,000 a week by selling her flatulence

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000
to strangers. A video detailing her

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
smelly side hustle currently boasts 6.6

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
million views. That's the fart of the deal.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
I thought farts were super niche,

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000
but also something fun, quirky, and different, said Stephanie

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Motto. She first gained international recognition

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000
after appearing on the reality TV show 90 Day Fiancé, and she has since started

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000
her own YouTube channel, and also, oh, she founded her own OnlyFans

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
clone called Unfiltered. Oh.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000
That's more of a fucking hustle than selling farts in a jar, lady.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Well, that's what I mean. It sounds like she's a businesswoman, but she's also doing this as a

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
side hustle. First of all, if you have successful,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
if you have a successful business already,

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:28.000
what the fuck do you need to be doing this for?

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000
This isn't desperation. This is just, she's fucking weird.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Listen, listen. $50,000 a week, though.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.000
That's a lot of money. True. That is true, but freaking

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
can't help but feel that this isn't 100% necessary

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
for her to do. She eventually

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:52.000
turned to selling her jarred farts on a platform because she thought it'd be a hilarious

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
publicity move that would get a lot of people's attention. But then it turns out

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
that she, the gassy gal made $50,000

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:04.000
in one week from hawking her toots. Her unfiltered

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
inbox is flooded daily with people wanting to purchase jars of her farts

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:12.000
and that people frequently request videos of the production process

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.000
from caboose to container. So you want to buy

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
a video of this chick putting a jar up to her asshole and farting into it

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
and then quickly, quickly canning it so that the smell stays there for when you buy it.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
I can't even blame her

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
really, because she's just responding to incentives. It's the guys who buy

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000
the stuff that I really hate.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000
So, she

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
eats beans, a protein muffin, a yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, and sometimes

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:56.000
a protein shake, and then she fills the mason jar

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
with flower petals, because flower petals that are scentless can

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
absorb other scents and make the scents last longer. And then she farts

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
into the jar of flower petals.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I like how she's put thought into this.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Like, this isn't just a thing for her, this is a proper

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000
business model. She's innovating on fart jars, what the fuck?

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Man, okay.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I know that we were going on a couple years ago about gamer girl bathwater

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
or whatever, but this chick takes it to a whole other level.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000
That's what I mean. She has evolved thoughttery.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000
She's innovating thoughttery.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Fucking hell. Alright, what's next? What's next? Oh.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Hold on, let me just pause this. Tennessee man

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
pulls out an AK-47 after being told to

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000
wait 10 minutes for his Little Caesars pizza.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Fuck. I guess he fucking wanted his pizza.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
That's what I mean. That must have been some really good fucking pizza.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Have you had Little Caesars before? I haven't. I have and it's

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.000
actually really shit. It's like the cheapest, most cardboard fucking pizza

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
you can get. Like $8 for a pizza and it's just garbage.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Alright, cause my understanding was that

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Little Caesars was like, my understanding is that Little Caesars did

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
like, what was it called, the hot and ready pizza

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:32.000
where basically they just take a pizza

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000
that's already been made and put it in a box and give it to you really cheap.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Yes, they do. And it's not very good. It's pretty shitty. No, I can

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:44.000
imagine not. That sounds like something you would buy if you had like 15

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000
minutes on the clock for a lunch break or something. And that is what I did

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000
back, cause when I worked, the last grocery store job I worked at, there was Little Caesars

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
pizza in the area, like a 2 minute walk away, so I would do that all the time.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000
It was so fucking bad. Okay, so

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
one man allegedly went too far. When he told his Little Caesars pizza

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:08.000
was not hot and ready, he pulled an AK-47 on the employees.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000
He points the gun at me and he says, where's my pizza?

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
I want my pizza now.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
He became upset when he was told that his pizza was not in fact

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
hot and ready, but he would have to wait 10 minutes for the pizza.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:28.000
He left the store, went to his car and came back with the weapon.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.000
So

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
another customer in the store who had gotten her pizza

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
gave it to him, which was enough to make him leave. The employees

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.000
then called the police who tracked him down and arrested him.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000
The employees started screaming, we are not

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000
always hot and ready. Never listen to the commercial. We're not

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.000
always hot and ready.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I like how that's how, where her

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
mind turns to is the fact that the commercial is misleading and it's not

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.000
just, this guy's a fucking psycho.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Like, I'm sorry about our misleading

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
advertising, sir.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Right, okay, we have had a super chat so I'm going to address it.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000
No problem.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Merc for $5, thank you very much. Fart in jars

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.000
are the new NFTs.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Oh God. What does this AK-47 dude

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000
do when his girlfriend isn't hot and ready?

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Alright, here's the next one that I've got.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Bay Area car break-ins are on the rise, prompting

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:52.000
car owners to leave their trunks open.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Wait, isn't, wasn't this the thing that fucking

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:00.000
what's-his-face Seth Rogen

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.000
was saying wasn't an issue? Yes.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.000
So it turns out that people

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.000
are just leaving their cars open with nothing in them so that the windows

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000
don't get destroyed as people look through them.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Yeah, basically people are just saying, look, I

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.000
have fuck all to give you, so just leave me alone.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Yep.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.000
And I like how Seth Rogen is so disconnected

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.000
from anything outside of California, at this point he says, oh yeah, the last 10 years

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:40.000
my car's been broken into 15 times, that's totally normal.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Yep. No, it's not. It's not normal.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Maybe it's a

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Canadian thing, but even in our big cities there's not that much

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
thefts or car break-ins. Oh no, like, London

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000
is the crime capital of the UK,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000
like with it being its capital city and also because it's

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
really poorly run, but it's like

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000
and like we have rising gang warfare and rising knife

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.000
crime and all that stuff, your car will be fine.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.000
So this person says

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
imagine having to clean out your car and leave it

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:28.000
open in the public just so people won't break the windows on it.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Oakland, we are looking sad, man.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Yeah. However, the police say you shouldn't do it because

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000
they can steal your batteries, they can steal your tires, they can go into your glove department and find your

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000
insurance, so you still shouldn't do this, but

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000
no one's stopping these robbers.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Fuck. Just leave California, guys. Just get the fuck out of California.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I keep telling Lilith to move.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000
I know, but she keeps saying she's comfortable there, doesn't she? Well, what happened is she inherited

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.000
a house. Oh, I see. So, like, at the very

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000
least she has to find a buyer for that if she was going to move and then move to a decent place.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000
And also, despite all of California's problems, the other areas of the states aren't exactly

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000
as trans-friendly. That's like, okay, yeah, fair enough, I get it. I understand.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.000
She just moved to Canada, fuck.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Even more conservative areas here, they're very much

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000
like, we'll just leave you alone if you're not doing anything wrong. We don't care if you're trans kind of thing.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000
That's how things are here. It's pretty much the same in the

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:36.000
UK, it's just fucking, as long as you

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.000
don't, like, yeah, we're a bit grumpy, but as long as you mind

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000
your own business, no one's going to give you trouble. Yep.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
I'm going to continue on. I'm sorry I called the Grinch

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000
anime. Please stop threatening my family.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Dear

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
vindictive Japanese cartoon watchers, you know me

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
as the sack of shit who referred to the Grinch as anime in a now

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.000
viral blog post. While I have some to regret,

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
while I have come to regret this post deeply, both personally and professionally,

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.000
for the sake of my family, I must humbly request that you cease

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000
your highly coordinated retaliation, which has already escalated to an

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:24.000
alarming degree. Fucking hell, man.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:28.000
First of all, you are wrong,

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000
while you are wrong that the Grinch is not an anime, it's a cartoon,

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000
and I will die on that hill, even though anime

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:40.000
is literally just short for animation, so.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
The blowback began almost immediately with internet

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:48.000
user Yu Yu Hakusho Queer, who came out of

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:52.000
the box strong with, you pinhead fuck, the Grinch is not

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
anime, I'll ensure you and your family wake up every day in harm's

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000
way. Minutes later, another user, Ms. Hente

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Shawty, posted a Google 360 view of my mother's

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.000
apartment with the caption, his mom's crib, do ya thang.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000
The threatening remarks piled on, with a few users

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000
taking it to the extreme by posting photos of baby carrots and claiming,

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.000
these are the author's penis. Those were not my penis.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000
No shit. From slanderous to

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
dangerous, no heinous comments were off limits from anime

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000
fans. It's the intimidation of my family members that have crossed moral

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000
bounds, the threats via email and snail mail, the bodily

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.000
fluids on their porches, the multiple incidents of dumping hot

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.000
hookah coals into my mother's shoes. It has all been

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
shamefully too far, and for what it's worth, this is the sort of holiday destruction

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:52.000
the Grinch would have wanted. I sincerely apologize

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000
for calling how the Grinch stole Christmas anime

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000
and for calling the Grinch one of the best guys in anime. This is not

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.000
the half-hearted apology of a man fearing for the life of his family

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
and the well-being of his mother.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.000
This is such a stupid article.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000
It's literally just a case of, it's like, this reads

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.000
like an absurdist post. Like fucking

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000
why are people sending death threats to this guy because he called the Grinch anime?

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.000
The thing is... Even calling the Grinch anime sounds like a shit post.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.000
I have a feeling, yeah yeah, you know what this is?

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:36.000
He did call the Grinch an anime, and he did get

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000
a blowback from it, but this is him making fun of the blowback.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000
That's what this is. That sounds more plausible to me,

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000
actually. Yeah, because The Hard Times

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000
is not a satire site in the same way as The Babylon Bee, but

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000
it does do these kind of jokey posts, yeah. I would certainly

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000
hope so, because otherwise, anime fans, you're different from

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
when I was at my peak of anime fandom, but you need to calm

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
the fuck down. Okay, there's

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000
like four articles left but we're running out of time, so I'm gonna do the last one.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000
I'm gonna do the one that I intended to end the show on, because this is

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
fucking hilarious. Check this out. Somehow

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Adolf Hitler has received a COVID vaccine passport

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.000
in the EU. I told you

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.000
it was the Fourth Reich.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.000
The private key used to sign the EU's digital COVID certificates

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
appears to have leaked, leading to forged certificates for people,

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.000
even dead ones like Hitler. The former Supreme Leader

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000
of 1940s Germany would appear to be alive and well if the EU's

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:52.000
digital vaccination program is to be believed.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
Actually, he's doing better than well. He's been vaccinated for COVID-19.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Well, very nice. Yeah, no, Hitler is still

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:04.000
dead, don't worry. Yeah, nobody's, nobody's out there, you know,

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000
making clones of Hitler and like raising them up in cryogenic

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000
stasis in Argentina or something, all right? No one's actually doing that.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
It's not some really cringey action movie where he takes off his glasses and goes, my god,

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000
he's back.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.000
It would appear that someone has gotten their hands on the private cryptographic

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.000
key used to certify digital COVID-19 vaccination

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000
cards in certain European countries and has been forging bullshit

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000
certificates for real people. Cyber criminals in the dark web were recently

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000
spotted selling access to what they claimed were forged digital vaccination

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:44.000
certificates for $300 a pop. When asked by journalists what they were doing,

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.000
one criminal provided them with a working, a working vaccine certificate

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000
for Adolf Hitler. In addition to the former dictator, approved

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000
vaccine passports for Mickey Mouse and SpongeBob SquarePants were also

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:00.000
being hawked. Well, you have to, you have to imagine

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.000
that he doesn't want to get isolated in Mickey Mouse's clubhouse

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.000
and you know, Bikini Bottom's been on lockdown for the past

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:12.000
six months, so you know, he wants to get outside, he wants to breathe some

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.000
fresh air again. The fake but approved

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
certificates were recently viewed and they were able to verify

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.000
that Hitler's was still working as of Thursday.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.000
The fake certificates appear to be sourced from some kind of compromise of the EU's

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:32.000
digital vaccination certificate program, which is Europe's recently instituted

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.000
effort to ensure that all citizens are vaxxed before they can travel or attend most

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000
recreational events. Also called the Green Pass, the certificate

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000
can be obtained through a variety of methods, either via health agencies or testing

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000
centres following vaccination. And it's pretty much a requirement if you want to see a movie,

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000
eat a restaurant, or do anything that involves fun. According to the European Commission, the pass

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.000
contains a QR code with a digital signature. However, it would appear that

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
the private key responsible for validating those certificates has been leaked

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.000
or misused. Because now they're just making a bunch of joke certificates.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.000
That's fucking great. Man.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Actually, as someone in the chat pointed out, Adolf Hitler

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:16.000
literally won an election in Namibia last year. I did that article too.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000
There was a guy who was, it was a former German colony

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:24.000
and they didn't really know much about World War II. So people there

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.000
were just naming their kids after like their grandparents or whatever. And they had, they sometimes had

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.000
German names. So one kid grows up with the name Adolf Hitler

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
not knowing what it means and he wins an election

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.000
in Namibia. And then he has to like tell the world, uh, I know I don't

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000
intend to take over the entire world. I'm sorry.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Fucking.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000
You sometimes forget the

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:56.000
fucking, just how big the world is, don't you?

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Bullshit can happen.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:04.000
So it seems like someone got a hold

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:08.000
of how you make these certificates and has just been making fake ones.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Like crazy. Including one for Adolf Hitler.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000
I like how he hasn't just been making fake ones for other people. He's just been

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000
making shitpost ones as well. To be fair, he's probably doing both.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000
He's just doing the other ones like silently. That's happening here. There's like

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000
there are doctors who don't agree with the vaccine passports, even

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000
though they're like pro-vax and they will just give you an exemption now.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Cause like, fuck it, we got to stop this. So there are some doctors who are just like silently handing out

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000
exemptions. Yeah. And there's like a lot of places here that aren't

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.000
accepting them either. You know, they're not, they're not

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000
when places, like, okay, hold on.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Now you have to have your phone scanned to go into a restaurant, but there are some restaurants here that are just like

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000
we're not going to bother with that shit. That's fucking bullshit. We're not going to scan.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.000
It's like, oh, cool. That's how it should be. No one should be listening to this anymore. It's fucking ridiculous.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Anyway, that's the articles.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:08.000
I have like five more, but we've run out of time. So I will do

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:12.000
those next week. It's not a big deal. Let me just, okay.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Yeah. I have switched, yeah, I have switched us back to

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000
the live, to the live screen. So it's literally just the picture of Shinji with a

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000
coffee. Shinji?

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Shinji with a coffee. Yeah. Why Shinji though?

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Because it was the weekly sip and it was the first thing that came to mind that was both anime

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
and was coffee related.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Awesome. Plus it was

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.000
the thing about Shinji is that he looks vaguely like me if I was

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.000
if I was thin and scrawny. And also the fact that

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.000
he also like, he looked, it's

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:56.000
in that picture, he just looks mildly unimpressed.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.000
So wait,

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000
are you saying that you would jack off over an unconscious woman's body?

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.000
No, I would not do that.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.000
You wouldn't do, you wouldn't do the ultimate Shinji move?

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:16.000
I'm so fucked up.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Actually, okay, that got

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000
back when that movie first came out in like 2005 or whatever it was, that movie

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:28.000
got put on Canada's official list of banned, banned

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000
movies because of child porn in it.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.000
Because it showed Asuka's tits. Oh God.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Canada is terrible when it comes to animated CP like

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:44.000
stuff. Okay. If you, if you own a copy of that movie

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:48.000
in Canada, like a legit copy that you bought, you can go to jail for the same length

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.000
of time as a child molester.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.000
Yeah. That's fucked. And here's the thing,

01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:00.000
nobody wants to tackle the problem because who wants to be the guy

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:04.000
that like takes on that bad optics, you know, of

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000
oh, you're the one who wants to make drawn child porn legal.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.000
It's like Jesus. Even, everyone knows

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000
that it's stupid, it's too far, but no one wants to be the person who has that

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.000
on their legacy, you know what I mean?

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Yeah, I get what you mean. Right. We do have

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Jackson for five dollars, thank you very much. Trans Acceptance is

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000
so far in Canada that my very conservative parents over ten years ago

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.000
were not willing to accept I was trans just because I cross-dressed on a

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.000
dare once.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000
That sounds about right. Like lots of Canadians are, lots of Canadians are just

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000
like, I don't care what you do in private, just as long as you're not like

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.000
being fucking ridiculous like a lot of people are, as long as you're just like

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.000
being a regular person, you can do whatever weird shit you want. It's like, okay, cool. You know, that's how it should be.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Yeah, that sounds violently Canadian.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Like, nobody likes pride parades,

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000
nobody likes big demonstrations, nobody likes violent demonstrations.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000
But if you're just like, if you're gay or if you're trans and you're just hanging out and being a regular

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.000
person, nobody here gives a shit.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
It's like, yeah, it's pretty much the same in the UK.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:24.000
You will get some areas where people, where like the odd individual

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.000
will be a dick about it, but for the most part it is just people

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000
who are just like, alright, fair enough.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Like, let's take, like

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.000
I'm sure if you've kept up with Count Dankula,

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000
like Count Dankula's Twitter, you'll have seen a regular poster on there called

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Femboy Blacksmith.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:52.000
He goes to college dressed in girls' clothes

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000
and no one cares. Like,

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:00.000
no one gives a shit.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.000
And as far as I can remember, it's been like that since the 90s. Like, maybe not earlier, like in the

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.000
80s had some legit homophobia floating around in there, but then

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000
when the 90s came around, it was like, who cares anymore?

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000
People were just like, private, you know?

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Well, put it this way. In the 1960s, I think it was a case of like,

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
two thirds of people found homosexuality to be, you know,

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.000
like horrible. And then by

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.000
97, I think it was, this is a statistic I saw years

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.000
ago, so I might be getting the exact date wrong. I think it was something like

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000
only 10% of people found homosexuality to be wrong.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Yep. Yep. Honestly, like a lot of those

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000
social problems have been solved at this point. People are just getting crazy online

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.000
over fucking nothing.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000
All right. I think that's about the end for me though. Who do you have on next?

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000
Single player Carl and Charles Akitsune.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:04.000
I'm supposed to go on their podcast at some point. That's right.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Yeah. It's a good podcast. It's a good laugh.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.000
I'm an editor for Single Player Carl,

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000
so he's like, not only is it a good

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.000
laugh, they're also very interesting to talk to. So I'd highly recommend it.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Right, right. Does, does Chaos Charge still work

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:28.000
for It's a Gundam? I know he was like his

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000
either editor or something along those lines for a while.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Well, he did rig the

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Gundam 3D model for him. Yes. I'm not sure

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:44.000
if he was ever like an editor or something. He's not stewed.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000
That's a misconception. People thought he was stew. He's not.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.000
That's a misconception, but he

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000
I do know that he did rig his 3D model for him. Oh, who's stew then?

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Stew's just a character. It's made up.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Yeah, see, I think that's why last time I talked to Gundam, he said

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.000
that Charza was stew in spirit.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Yeah. Because basically

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000
what happened was is that people started assuming that and he said

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
and people, so, and it kind of Charza started

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000
going along with it for a laugh, just, you know,

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.000
started going along with it just, you know, to

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.000
just for a laugh, but it got so prevalent that Gundam kind of pulled him

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
aside and said, yeah, we're going to have to stop doing that now because people actually believe it's

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000
true. Oh, well.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Yeah. And to be fair, Dave on my side of things, Dave is a real person.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I mean, kind of. He's like, he's half alive.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.000
He's in a constant state

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:56.000
of potential undeath, but he is

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.000
technically in a legal sense alive.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Yes, yes, that is the case.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Jackson for another $5. I feel I should clarify this was in Alberta as well.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Okay, fair enough. Yeah, Alberta is like Canada's Texas.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Lots of oil, lots of conservatives, lots of people who want to leave Canada.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:20.000
It's basically the same thing culturally as Texas is.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000
And even then, they're still very live and let live there.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.000
You know? Yeah. Alright, I should probably

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:32.000
go then because it is 12.59 and my time's up at 1.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000
So, I will see you later, man.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Right, I'll catch you about. Thanks for listening. Yeah, no problem.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.000
See you later, Chat. Thanks for coming in. Bye-bye.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.000
And there we go. That's that. Definitely a very different

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000
weekly sip, but hey, it's always good to try something new.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:56.000
I will see you guys later. I gotta stream tonight.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:00.000
More Yakuza. I know usually Adam and Sitch stream, but fuck it.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000
I gotta catch up on my Yakuza playthrough on the gaming channel, so

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000
drop by the Twitch channel tonight or on the gaming YouTube, one or the other.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:12.000
And hopefully I'll have a new video for you tomorrow. Catch you next time,

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
guys! I love you.
